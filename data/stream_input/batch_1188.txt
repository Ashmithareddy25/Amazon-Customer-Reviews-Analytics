B0054SMIH6|5.0|What a breath of fresh air on this world of re-done, re-vamped, and re-branded films!! It is deep, interesting, and entertaining.    I thought this movie was thoughtful, well-written, well-acted, and overall VERY good!     I'd highly recommend this piece as a great way to spend a couple of hours.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|This is an instant classic.  I can't even begin to describe the power in this album.  I never write a review for anything and this makes me want to jump up for joy.  So much emotion conveyed by/through her voice.  This crosses all boundaries and should be in the collection of any music fan.  Amazing to see an artist get better with their second release as well.  Rare in this day and age and hopefully a sign of what is to come.
0061784788|5.0|My experience: Holy mac, I dont know what I have been missing with this author as I love this genre and even before I got past the first 25% of the novel, I thought I was going to need a pace maker after reading this novel.  I am a female avid reader and love this genre, so hail James Rollins on my induction into his world of writing.  The pace was fast, but gripping, and so much wonderful details to keep the reader enjoying the pace and painting a canvass so real.  At times, I had to check in with myself and ask 'was that a real fact, or another brilliant piece of writing to bring the reader into the story?'  The author was not afraid to give real emotions to his cast of characters and that helped you to endear them or fear them as you follow their journey on what feels like a Jack Bauer \\"24\\" episode, there is no restrooms visit!<br /><br />What made this novel so gripping in its pace is how the plot and action unravelled: each chapter throws you into a new discovery about the plot.  Often, the author leaves the chapter on a cliff hanger as he jumps onto the next chapter and picking up the cliff hanger that he last left another character!  I found this approach kept the plot moving and still provided so much interest to keep you gasping in each chapter.  I just wished i had an oxygen tank with me as I was holding my breathe on so many occasions that my husband was getting a wee worried about me staying a live to finish the book.  The novel had a great plot and that is often missing in some of the great 'thriller' authors.  This did not disappoint and I was thoroughly absorbed right to the end.  More please!<br /><br />if you are new to James Rollins and love this genre, this novel will not disappoint at all.  For the rest of the fans, I have a lot of reading to do and catch up with the other novels in the Sigma series.
B0007TKNII|3.0|If there were no staged performance and this was all there was of Phantom, I would give it a higher rating. There are some cool scene additions, effects and edits. The acting and singing are fine. But it does not match the magic of the live stage performance.
159562015X|5.0|I was recommended to this book to help discover what my \\"strengths\\" are... and boy are they right! I didn't think it would be accurate (I was skeptical) but after reviewing it with my wife, it is QUITE SCARY how accurate it is... It has helped me understand who I am, what I react to, and it helps me to work with my \\"strengths\\" instead of working to fix my weaknesses. This book is a great tool, and would recommend it to anyone who wishes to find out the deepest parts of their inner strengths...
B0030DBGXY|5.0|Other reviews are pretty much spot on, so I'll add some comparison inf instead.  IMO, SRK in VG1/San Mai III is Cold Steel's answer to Fällkniven's A1 & S1 (personally own both). Size / weight wise it falls right between the A1 & S1 (gap filler if you ask me). HRC wise VG1 / San Mai III (as compared to Fällkniven's VG10 laminated steel)is slightly softer but difference in edge retention / ease of sharpness is negligible. SRK does not come with a factory convex edge like the Fällkniven but that can be remedied by using a strop kit to reprofile the factory edge. If you want to have Fällkniven equivalent quality but on a tight budget, can't go wrong with the SRK. BTW, check out Cold Steel's Master Hunter in VG1 / San Mai III, according to Ethan Becker, one of Cold Steel's best designs, IMO an even better value than the SRK.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|My friend was extremely happy with the production quality of the disk as well as the quality of the movie it's self. It was an excellent buy!
B0055OK2T0|4.0|The Adjustment Bureau is loosely based on a short story by Philip K. Dick first published in Orbit Science Fiction magazine in 1954.  In that story, Dick conceives of a secret \\"Adjustment Team\\" whose only function is to intervene on matters of historical importance and set us straight according to an overarching master plan.  The movie takes this concept and runs with it, adding a powerful love story between David Norris (played by Matt Damon) and Elise (played by Emily Blunt), a love that violates the master plan, presumably God's plan, who is referred to only as the \\"chairman\\" in the movie.  The Adjustment Bureau is called upon to set things right.     Philip Dick is one of my favorite authors and his concepts are consistently mind blowing.   Although screenwriter George Nolfi took liberties with the story, addressing the issue of personal destiny vs. free will and adding layers of complexity, the result is satisfying and superior to Dick's original story, which is one of his lesser works.  I found the movie enjoyable and I especially liked the chase sequences in New York, not knowing where doors might lead to.  Exit a door at the Museum of Modern Art and wind up on Liberty Island or Shea Stadium.  Cool trick!
B00005UWMX|5.0|Ladyhawke is about Isabau (Michelle Pfieffer) and a knight named Captain Navarre (Rutger Hauer) who are under an evil bishops terrible curse because the bishop was in love with Isabau too and he felt that if he could not have her no man would. By day Isabau is a hawke and by knight Navarre is the wolf. Navarre meets Phillipe (Mathew Brodrick) who is a pick pocket and a monk and together have to come up with a dangerous plan to get into the church and confront the bishop. Captain Navarre and his Lady Isabau must confront the bishop when there is \\"a day with out a night and a night with out a day.\\" It will leave people who have never seen the movie wondering will they be able to defeat the bishop? Or will the dreaded curse go on forever? The acting is wonderful. I thought Rutger Hauer was very handsome in this movie. He isn't so handsome now. I also thought the movie had its funny parts in it. As I was reading the reviews I notice some people complained about how bad they thought the music was. I say just watch the movie and ignore the fact that the music isn't good. Just watch the friggen movie and enjoy it!!
B000AP04FG|4.0|Some films and books are fun to watch and read even though the basic premise is unrealistic and even absurd. The viewer/reader needs to put logic aside. There is an old Yiddish proverb that applies, \\"one doesn't question stories.\\" This doesn't mean \\"don't ask questions about it.\\" In fact the opposite is true. One should question everything one sees and hears and never accept something based on faith. What it is addressing is the recognition that in stories, fables, myths, parables, and the like, the narrator is purposely basing his or her tale on an absurd notion that one should realize and never forget is absurd, but nevertheless not allow this fact to destroy or even minimize enjoying the work. All of this applies here for the basic premise that the spouses of a loving couple could not know that the other spouse is an assassin is highly unlikely.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|I found this book to be funny, sad a very relateable. Altough I am not from London or have a \\"ken\\" like boyfriend I found that I was very much able to relate to the main character in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone, and especially the twenty something girl that is questioning her career and place in life.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|Good story.  Better than most superhero movies we have watched.  We(wife and I ) liked it more than most of the 90's batmans, superman 3 and 4, spiderman 2 and 3, Both fantastic 4 movies, both hulk movies,  Thor, Captain America, dare devil, and x-men 2 and 3 as well as wolverine.  It is a fun movie that expects the viewer to except a large amount of fantastic stuff.  If you can't then you should watch transformers...wait... that expects too much also.      The only negative I see about it was it could have been a bit longer (15 mins)...  believe it or not it needed more action scenes.  A bit more for his training and a bit more at the end fight would have helped.    Otherwise, my wife and I liked it.  She liked the story line stuff with Hal and is gal.        Green lantern has a rich history to draw on and some really great BAD GUYS.  We hope they make a 2nd and 3rd...  Maybe we can see Guy Gardner and John Stewart.  Then a flash movie or 2 and wonder woman some more batman and superman  and then justice league.      By the way Justice league unlimited seasons 1-2 is the best superhero cartoon series ever.  Really good stuff.
031250926X|5.0|We first heard this book from Babies and Books at our library. The repetitiveness and rhythm is something babies love. My baby is no exception. He has over 20 books and while he can only point to what he wants, this is the one he requests the most. He loves to flip the pages and slide the tabs to reveal the next animal. If he's upset, wherever we are, all I have to say is \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear\\" and he perks right up and smiles. Of course, I can recite the whole thing from memory now so we can take the story along with us anywhere, even when the book is at home. Buy it, it's a winner!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After posting, I went back and read other reviews. It's true that this version does not have the summary page at the end. I forgot to mention that. We were expecting it to be there as well. We've adapted and what we do now is count the children at the end. He gets a kick out of me pointing and counting to nine. Sometimes we also add \\"Children, Children, What Do You See?\\" then I let him start at the beginning and flip every page again, while I call out what we see. HTH!
0140277447|5.0|By writing this book Iris Chang has finally brought to public's attention something that should have never been forgotten - one of the most horrible crimes in the history of wars. A must read for everyone, until Nanking massacre takes its rightful place in history books.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|Pretty much any way you look at this movie, it's \\"The Bad Seed\\" again, which has been done numerous times to better effect.  However, \\"Orphan\\" maintains a very creepy and intense atmosphere throughout, which is primarily what I look for in a good horror movie.  Of course, the young sociopathic girl engaging in murder and mayhem is supposed to be the main shocker, but that's been done already.  However, certain sexual overtones creep into this film which I found unsettling and very disturbing, and that aspect of this film was pulled off very well.  That is, until they ruin it with a ham-fisted and entirely unnecessary twist near the end that negates everything.    If you've never seen or heard of \\"The Bad Seed,\\" or even \\"The Good Son,' then definitely see this movie!  If you're old enough to have seen those films, \\"Orphan\\" is still worth a watch because of its intensely creepy atmosphere.  In most respects, this is a very good horror film.    Brent
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and finished it in 2 days. I immediately bought the second. I highly recommend it to any one that reads this genre.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|if you have unlocked a lot of games then don&apos;t do the update bc it will make you start all over. also the controls are not that good to hard and sticky

0060531053|5.0|This brewing and recipe guide is the easiest to understand and is fun to read.  I have a bit of reading hatred and find it hard to follow along with most instructions that have come from an overly technical rock headed brewer who forgot that at one time he didn't know how.    The author makes it really easy along with funny things about brewing.  He really takes the edge off errors making the brewing a lot more fun!
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I don't usually like action type movies, but, bought this one because a friend is in it........really enjoyed it!  This is a fun romp!movie.......
B003UESJHY|3.0|This was made from a real story. All the acting was acceptable, but Mark Wallberg is beginning to be the same character in each of his movies. There was a lot of The Shooter personality in this movie. Don't like fighting so my feelings are tainted by that. The movie was just too predictable and was not very entertaining. Definitely for a select audience. This movie was definitely superior to that \\"The Other Guy\\" - a real waste!
1603425381|5.0|This book includes 150 stitches, with instructions for turning corners on edgings.<br /><br />What I like:<br />There is a large, well lit photograph of each stitch in vibrant, colored yarn(s).  (This booklet is fun to flip through!)  The book includes a great range of stitch designs for borders, many of which you are unlikely to have in other stitch guides.  The special stitches are described within the pattern so you don't have to do a lot of flipping to the back of the book.  Each stitch includes both pattern abbreviations and stitch symbols.  There is a glossary and guide to stitch symbols in the back.  Many of the patterns incorporate different stitches, so that a multiple row border will not just repeat the same pattern each row.  Many stitches can be adapted for using throughout the project, rather than solely as a border.<br /><br />What I don't like (or what's missing):<br />There is no pattern difficulty rating listed.  The binding doesn't lay flat, so it is difficult to crochet and read the pattern at the same time.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really great book, and a wonderful stitch guide.  Even though it would be awesome if the book would lay flat, many other crochet books don't.  Similarly, many stitch guides don't include a pattern difficulty rating, so I'm still giving it 5 stars.

0736092269|5.0|This book covers every major exercise, for every major muscle group. What I love about this book is that every exercise is spelled out in detail, with an excellent illustration. At no point did the author get lazy or leave out information.    Pros:  Good for beginners.  Accurate and up to date information.  Clear explanations of how to perform each exercise.  Excellent drawings.  Well organized.  Information on how to avoid injury for certain exercises, and for each muscle group, a page or two dedicated to avoiding and treating injury.  Explanations of how variations in body-type will affect the way you perform certain exercises.    Cons:  Really, nothing major. There are a couple of illustrations in the back of the book (pg. 189-193) of the skeleton and muscles that should probably go in the front of the book.    Side note:  I also really liked The Gold's Gym encyclopedia of Training.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Being of this nature I found this movie \\"Secretary\\" absolutely on target. Every detail, every expression was right. Nothing except the 3- day sitting at desk scene was so accurate. That scene was not realistic, however Maggie's devotion was. Her frustrating self spanking was nailed also-just not there. It takes two and when it happens, fireworks explode for both.
B001VNB54A|5.0|The movie depicts the Pacific battles in such details and factual it is hard to tell whether they are real battles or movie enactment. It makes one thinks the war is really happening.
B004V7XWEE|5.0|While most anyone over 40 knows this is a great, great album - the even better news is this is a lovingly crafted deluxe edition box, worth every penny you will pay for it. I think even at $99 it would be a good value.  Original LP jacket actually opens out as a book with large, great photos of M. Gaye. The music of course is great - lots of extras on the two CDs and an LP of the original album in a new mix is also in it.  Only slight disappointment is that - for collectors - lots of the bonus tracks have been previously released on other 'What's Goin' On' special anniversary editions prior to this one...but, this one IS the best, the total package.

B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Having grown up watching the Smurfs, I missed them all these years they were discontinued.  Not sure why this very cartoon I loved had to be discontinued.  As soon as the film came out, my friends (who are also fellow Smurf fans) and I supported the film on opening night, Friday July/29/2011.  We watched the 9:15pm show in Edwards Stadium 12 Theater in Brea, CA.  I thoroughly enjoyed my very first 3D film in my local theater in Brea, CA.  This was in a downtown area, so it was very conviently located; both my friends and I loved the movie from the beginning to the end.  The three of us were the last ones to leave the theater while everyone was already gone.  We love the Smurfs THIS BIG.  Anyway, they had to twist the original storyline a bit to make a more dramatic story out of the Smurfs, and the 3D effects were logical along with the storyline.  I'm very picky once it comes to a movie as I would never pay full price for a movie; I've seen how much movie prices have gone up since when it was only $4 back in the days....  I'd most always wait for it to become cheaper to watch, and I would not just dare watch ANY movie.  Yet I chose this as my very 1st. 3D experience because I knew it was my type of movie.  Alas!!  I'd go back once it gets cheaper cuz I don't think I can afford $15 for a 3D movie that many times even though I loved it.  Both the actor+actress did a great job in the film throughout.  Since I'm not to spoil the movie for further customers who want to support it, as they should, I feel ya'll should give it a shot.  This film kept me laughing from the opening of the movie to the closing.  I was drawn with the Smurfs; it was refreshing to hear Katy Perry's voice as Smurfette; Smurfette took on a larger role in this film version and some of you would be surprised to find out what she CAN actually do if you gave The Smurfs film version a shot.  George Lopez was even one of the male Smurfs....can't remember exactly which Smurf because the End Credits rolledup too quickly~One of my friends made a comment, but I can't recall now.  I was going for Katy Perry as Smurfette and Neil Patrick as the main actor, so this movie made my past weekend Smurfabulous!!!!  You'll miss out if you don't support the Smurfs' successful return.  From being a huge Smurf fan, I've started collecting all the Smurfs' toys now starting with Brainy as I just found out that McDonalds is supporting this film...Currently staring at Brainy (holding up a phone) as I'm writing this review.  They are just so cute, and they say \\"Smurf\\" w/every word!!!  I believe that this film was and STILL IS Smurfacular!!!!

B0052UZIFA|3.0|I have a droid charge and when this app doesnt crash its awesome. It has to do with the number of times you launch it. after a fresh boot it always works the first time. Then sometime after that if you launch it again it will crash by either getting real slow and unresponsive and not letting you push any buttons so you have to take the battery out OR it will just reboot on its own.
B000TGJ8A8|5.0|Always love this movie genre, especially the twists in the plots.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B005AUWXZ0|4.0|We were pleasantly surprised by this movie.  We loved the original Cars and I was a bit skeptical of a sequel.  This movie rivaled the first!  My kids (10 & 7) both loved the movie, with my oldest enjoying some of the more subtle humor.  The story line is much different from the first, with more focus on Mater.  I would compare it to Cars meets James Bond (fun spy theme).  My youngest has said that this is her favorite Cars movie.  While the underlying theme of friendship is still present, it isn't as obvious to the kids (who will likely focus more on the spy component).  Thus, the reason for just 4 stars and not 5.  All in all, a fun movie and I'd definitely recommend it to others, as well as purchase it when it comes out on Blu-Ray.
B000M5AJQI|4.0|I love the Hong Kong original movie better, especially the ending.  This NEW ending is too American - Good guys always win.
0061537969|5.0|This was a wonderful book looking at humans, other animals, physiological and emotional feelings all through the eys of Enzo the dog.  Enzo lives the gamit of life's travels through Denny's experiences of bachlorhood, courtship, marriage, baby, in-laws, friends, and even death.  I'm not a dog owner and I'm not particularly into car racing but that being said I could still get into the racing metaphores the dog used and see the humor in his descriptions.  This was a book that made me see human and animal behavior from a whole new perspective.  It was a great book.

0553386794|3.0|After the show debuted on cable (which we don't get) I got Game of Thrones to read after so many friends talked about how good it was.  And to address the comments of others the things that don't bug me are:<br /><br />1) That each chapter has the POV of a different character<br />2) The grittiness of the story... I don't expect, or want, flat, one dimensional heroes or villeins<br />3) The length.  I like long books when they are something I'm enjoying.<br /><br />However, here is what DOES bug me: after getting all the way through it, I realized that I felt like I had just read more than 700 page of set-up or introduction.<br /><br />That being said, I have started on the second book (I'm half-way through) but mostly because on the strong recommendations from friends I'd bought the first four books as a set, and feel like I almost HAVE to read it.  In some ways it is better than Game of Thrones.  Yet, I cannot believe the accolades that this book is getting.  It is NOT that good in my opinion.  Just OK.
B00111YM5G|4.0|Iam very upset after watching this movie although the making of the movie was very good the theme was so dark and leaving no hope at all for the human race  after all if God would abandon his Ark Angle's that he sent on a mission what hope do we have. This movie made me very sad as all the movies in recent times where evil always wins out against good Iam so sick of it. If you beleive in God and good Don't buy this movie it is such a downer. life is bad enough  with out watching this depressing movie.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Much happier with this over the standard keyboard.   Ability to tweak to meet your typing style.  Highly recommend to give this a shot.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|This Apple-branded HDMI connector is much better quality than the third-party connector I previously purchased. The HDMI + Dock connector was a great idea that alllows you to charge or sync your device while displaying it on the TV. The Apps look great on the TV. NOTE: While using Netflix, the red Netflix screen remains on the device the duration of your usage. The only issue I had was sometimes when I move the device while its connected to the TV, the screen goes black and I have to disconnect, then reconect. Don't know if the connector needs to be tighter on the device or if I need to remove the device from its leather case.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I don&apos;t understand why so many 1 star reviews. The game clearly says in the description that you start with 10 games &amp; play to unlock the rest. And the instructions can be viewed before playing a game. Overall, there are several fun mini games to play and pass the time. Plus, it is a nice challenge to see if you can collect enough points to unlock all the games.  Overall, a nice way to pass time.
0307887960|5.0|I recommend this diet. I know all people are different. But I am losing weight on this diet. I don't feel sluggish. My body is very diet resistant.

1400063515|1.0|The author is just too cute for his own good and basically a wanna-be intellectual anarchist. I'm not sure what this joker's credentials are (nor do I care) but I would imagine he's logged a number of hours at the bong, coming up with his \\"whoa, dude!\\" observations.  This book should do well with people too dumb to poke holes in all its idotic, half-baked theories - including the idea that all theories are wrong because they're theories (creationists must love this one).  To the author's claim that we can't know the world through abstractions, I say:  Einstein creates the Atom Bomb. To the author I say: Taleb creates a Stupid book.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I'm obsessed with Ancient Rome. It just amazes me how they were so ahead of their time with their innovations, yet so violent. Having traveled to Rome twice in my life and given the opportunity to see their achievements and destruction in person makes me appreciate their history. I never had HBO, so I didn't even know this series existed until I searched \\"Rome\\" here on Amazon just to browse items related to Rome. When this box set came up, I searched it on Youtube to see some clips. Then I read the reviews on here and it seemed like I'd enjoy it. Well, when it arrived I began watching it right away. They did a GREAT job making these discs. First off, just the box design alone is nice. It's not cheaply made or too bulky. My favorite feature is the option for \\"All Roads Lead to Rome\\". While watching the episodes, if this feature is selected, small pop-up windows will appear with explanations or historical facts that are related to the scenes or dialogue you are watching. And certain words or facts are further elaborated on with an interactive selection. Once you press ENTER, when prompted to do so, it will give even greater detail on the subject. I just can't believe they only made two seasons.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|how many flick games can one person stand to play? too much of the same thing and too difficult of a point scale.
0553801473|2.0|All I can say is how disappointed I am in this book,I couldn't stop reading the first few books and this one I have to make myself sit down and read it. I agree with some of the other reviews, Martin just goes on and on about nothing and no one is getting anywhere. I don't even know if I will finish reading the entire thing. All the main characters from before are barely if at all mentioned and from what I can tell from everyone else it isn't worth it. I am so tired of these good authors writing fantastic books but then they make you wait years for the next one and it's like they just keep dragging it out. I am sorry I pre-ordered this book. From now on I will wait and see if I should bother. This is nothing like the first few. Good luck to whoever can finish reading it.
1416550550|4.0|Overall, I really liked this book.  It was full of twists and turns and question marks, though about halfway through I'd figured out what was going to happen to tie up all the loose ends.  Didn't really spoil it though, because there were enough characters and their dilemmas to keep everything up in the air satisfactorily.  I was a little bit disappointed that, along with the title, there were too many similarities to the \\"Secret Garden\\" (crippled father, bed-ridden child brought out of it by an earthy lovable sprite, etc.--not to mention a walled garden that has gone to seed and needs cultivating).  Considering all of the other ways characters can be unique, I can't imagine why an author would feel the need to make them similar in any way.  Still, a worthwhile, good read.

B002XLBC0Q|5.0|It goes without saying what a fantastic album this is. Friday Music have done a bang up job with the packaging, except for one detail. The original back cover has the spider stalking a fly, but the fly is missing! A minor quibble but it never hurts to check with hard core fans before you send these things to the printer.  Still, it's great to have the gatefold cover and nice thick great sounding wax. Can't wait for the sequel \\"Welcome 2 My Nightmare\\" - long live the Coop!
B004WOS3P4|5.0|David Cook's new cd is really great. I really enjoyed the first cd.  Due to this I was ready for the new cd needing time to grow on me but was pleasantly surprised to love the songs after the first time listening to them.
0553386794|5.0|What can I say about the world George R R Martin has created except WOW! It still seems humanly impossible for one man to create such a fantastical world with so many in-depth characters, but he does, and he never lets you down. These books are so beloved to me that I was afraid I would be dissapointed in the series on HBO, but let me tell you again WOW! They did an amazing job. Grats to Peter Dinklage for his Emmy nom (I've been a fan since Tiptoes). Whether you read the series or watch the show you will love this world.
0525425578|1.0|This was just as boring and unbelievable as in the first novel of the series - the story just plods along. Theo is nowhere as believably clever as the young boy in The Client. The improbable dialogue, pedantic tone of the writing, and the overt, tedious effort to make Theo as savvy a 13-year old as possible, and smarter than some adults, makes this book an absolute chore to read. Also, the denouement is woefully anticlimactic.     I have a sneaking suspicion that this series may not be as popular with its target audience as with adults but, regardless, Grisham's novels do have a lot of selling power. You should save your money and, if you really must read this book, check it out from the library instead.
0439023521|5.0|Not many books written these days make me cry, but this trilogy did, and more than once. It's non stop nail biting suspense. I can't wait to see the movie.
B004LWZW24|2.0|I can't believe that it actually says that it is the most horrifying film since the exorcist...please...this movie couldn't hold a candle nowhere near the exorcist...the exorcist is the best creepiest horror movie ever made and i doubt anyone will ever be able to make a better horror movie than the exorcist...this movie is worth a viewing or two because it does have it's moments but it's such a disgrace from whoever put that it was the most horrifying film since the best horror movie of all time and if you think this, i know everyone has a right to their own opinion, but watch the exorcist first then watch this right after and see which one is more horrifying to you!!!
B001EKSW82|5.0|This is my favorite Amon Amarth Album. For their style the composition and sound of this album is great. The playing is tight and the instruments well balanced. The skill of this band's musicianship is clear on this album. This is an album I can easily listen to all the way through from start to finish and enjoy every song. It would actually be safe for me  to say that this is one of my favorite metal albums of all time and I listen to a LOT of metal spanning a range of different genres.   Also the album art is incredible.     If you like melodic death metal this is a good album to have.
0545259088|3.0|**May Contain Spoilers**  I was completely inlove with the first two books of this series. Stiefvater had created an imaginative and fresh new concept for werewolves, which was unlike many of the other concepts out there.  But from the off this book was a little different. Firstly, a major proportion of the start was of Sam moping, but fair enough, if my girlfriend and most of my family were running around in the woods as wolves, and there were people campaining for an aerial wolf hunt to obliterate the wolf population of my local area, I think I would be somewhat depressed too. So I overlooked this, and sure enough, as the book went on and Grace returned, I was satisfied that Sam had found something to smile about.  Cole rapidly became my favourite character in this book, and his search for the cure then also became more interesting to me than the plight of the main two characters.  I often find it difficult to fault books, and overlook most problems provided that the rest of the book is enjoyable.  But the ending left so many loose ends that I was thoroughly underwelmed, and extremely disappointed.  I can only hope that she plans to surprise us with another book, to answer some of the questions we have been left with as regards to Grace's education, her family, Sam's body's later rejection of his 'cure', Coles attempts to find a true cure, Isabel's life in california and so on...
B005BW0TO4|2.0|This album's alright, but don't except any groundbreaking new sound. This is a mash up of rhythms and chords from Seventeen Days and Away from the Sun with different lyrics. I'm not impressed!
0811836363|5.0|This is a must have for any fan of the most famous and greatest band that came from England, my apologies to the Stones and to Led Zeppelin but you need to give credit when credit is due, even though I bought this book for my dad and he is really happy with his present, when I got it I began to browse through its pages and I was blown away by the intimate details that came from the members of the fab four. After reading this book you get the idea of what it was like being a beatle told by the lads themselves and also you can feel their frustration when everyone wanted a piece from them or when they were treated like semi gods, when they where just 4 incredibly talented guys in a band that changed the world with their self written music. Let's keep The Beatles alive through their music, ideals and thoughts.
0307477479|3.0|The Goon Squad made a short lived visit to my home.  I'd looked forward to reading this Pulitzer Prize winner due to the various descriptions I read about it, as if the book was not easy to pigeonhole.  Yet overall I trudged my way through  and was glad when it was over; in full disclosure, I skimmed a couple of chapters.<br /><br />On the plus side the characters are strong and engaging, even when you don't like what they engage in. A highlight for me was Scotty and his fish. The problem was I got lost in trying to recall who was who and had to go to previous chapters to remember.  I went back too much and lost a strong interest in going forward.  The chapter  \\"Great Rock and Roll Pauses\\" came at the time I was counting down the pages to the book's end and I was disappointed in its presentation.  I went back to it and concluded that the chapter was presented in a Power point style as the content wasn't strong enough to present in narrative form.  That's my opinion, anyway. A Visit from the Goon Squad reminded me of the time I read the Pulitzer Prize winner \\"Martin Dressler: The Tale of an American Dreamer.\\"  I came away thinking it was an intriguing book, but wondered how it won the Pulitzer.<br /><br />Above all, the book's lack of hope made it's visit to my home short lived.  The celebrated author Wallace Stegner once said that he wrote about people in communities, and couldn't just write about people's private hells.  In the Goon Squad, whether in community or not, what you get are hells boiling over.  That was the writer's intent, but it was drain when these interconnected short stories are placed side by side. I discovered that the majority are stronger--and a number are good, when standing alone, and I enjoyed the back and forth passages in time. Yet winning entries from other years, namely Tinkers and Gilead, spoke of love, loss and hope.  With the Goon Squad you get some type of love, tremendous loss, and too little hope.  Again, it was the author's intent, but it was depressing.<br /><br />To each his/her own....and own is something I won't do with A Visit from the Goon Squad.pressing.     To each his/her own....and own is something I won't do with A Visit from the Goon Squad.
0553801473|5.0|I enjoyed the book thouroughly.  He leaves you wanting more.  I just hope it's not six more years before we find out what's happening next in the story!  In the meanwhile, I'll get my \\"Game of Thrones\\" fix off of the HBO series...
0553801473|3.0|The book was, at the same time, too long and too short. Too long because it was 1000 pages long, much of it filled with descriptions of food, clothes, the ski, the sea, food, castles and towns, the weather. Did I mention food? It was too short because the entire book seemed to be building up to something climatic, like the battle of the Blackwater in \\"A Clash of Kings\\", or the \\"Red Wedding\\" in A Storm of Swords. Instead, we got a bunch of cliffhangers. Very little got resolved. The plot moved at a glacial pace. Given the length of the book as well as all the years that ASOIAF fans have waited for its release, I feel like there should have been more.<br /><br />That said, there were redeeming features. It was great to see some familiar characters as well as the new. Theon chapters in particular were very well written. Martin's prose is still top notch. I was very much entertained almost throughout and finished it much more quickly than I typically finish books of such length. Still, while the trees are there, the forest (by which I mean the overarching story line) seems to be missing.
0553801473|3.0|So, George has finally given us a book after waiting all these years, and (spoiler alert), not much has changed.  Don't expect action and don't expect much in the way of wars.  Expect new cities and fun looks from new POV characters, and a few people dying (as always).  Tyrion is still my favorite character, but don't expect him to be a major mover and shaker in the book (even though he gets lots of chapters, he goes almost nowhere).<br /><br />So, in a nutshell:  lots of description and lots of inner monologue...not much action.  Once I made it about a third of the way through the book I didn't long to read it.  I didn't have a hard time putting it down, but it was nice during breaks and downtime to again enter the world of George R. R. Martin.  Please, step it up a bit next time George.  I don't like being strung out so you can sell more books.  I might buy the next one used in spite.

0767840135|4.0|This is my first Cirque du Soleil - DVD that I have purchased.<br /><br />The sound is great, whic is very important since the music is very good and there are none spoken dialogs (my only complain is that subtitles only work for the fist scene)<br /><br />The show itself is very dinamic and intersting, it seems a little short for me (which is usually and indication of something good, since good times go fast)<br /><br />There are some angles and positions of the camera that allow you to see the detail of certain perfomances.<br /><br />If you have not purchased a DVD of Cirque du Soleil this is a very good start.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|First of all this is a great show. Original, hilarious, charming, sometimes sweet and handsdown one of the Best Sitcoms out there. Its also at a really good price. Packaging and discs were in the perfect condition and prouct shipped quickly.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I do not even like Matt Damon, but for some reason I love this trilogy! Excellent audio and video quality!
0345529057|5.0|Product Perfectly sent to me in Perfect state. I have recieve it very Fast and without any issue, and that's very important since i'm not in America.  Thanks, This books are Great!!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Excellent audio and video quality on this DVD! I loved the fact that I was able to order it before the release date, too!
0553801473|3.0|ADWD was merely OK.  In my opinion, this book lacked focus.  There was plenty of ICE and very little fire and a lot of smoke.  There are nuggets in this volume that had me thinking Okay now we move forward...but alas more smoke.  The first half of this atrociously long book mirrored the last book...oh Martin actually explains that in \\"A Cavil on Chronology\\" about the dual nature of this tome.  Geography is the culprit...not haphazard plotting.<br /><br />That said, I still could not say that this book is awful...it provided some interesting meat to several questions about certain characters and total disassembles several others. Martin, destabilizes Dany.  She moves from strength (walked through fire) to meekness (the walls will protect Meereen).  He totally punks Jon Snow.  He moves from capable (Commander of the Wall) to discounting his own advice to himself repeatedly.  I did like how Martin delved into \\"Reeks\\" character--from a brash young hothead to a meek shell of a Ramsey fan boy who had occasional thoughts that would have required backbone.  The rest was, in my opinion, smoke and cliffhangers.  Cliffhangers only serve if we get to see who goes over the cliff in short order.  If WOW is as long and bloated as ADWD with page after page of...this is what we ate, and this is how the sea looked, or with more insipid phrases like \\"where do whores go?\\" or \\"you know nothing, Jon..\\" or \\"words are wind\\" I will not scream but skim most judiciously.<br /><br />I'm still interested enough to read the next installation (a copy from the library will do);  if it doesn't take 5 years to be published. Even three years in modern times is way too long for any author to complete a work in a series.<br /><br />In short...don't recommend this book to NASCAR fans...it's way to slooooooooooow and has no rhythm and is short on the music of great story telling--character or action driven plot.
B00005JMAH|4.0|Excellent audio and video quality on this DVD! There is only one thing that I do not like about the DVD itself. It starts out playing The Polar Express with Tom Hanks. It actually goes through the credits and everything, so you believe it is the wrong movie. Eventually the Harry Potter movie does start, but this one fooled me many times!
B003Y5H59W|4.0|I grew up on marvel comics and read issues on most of the super heroes, including Captain America. I went to see this film on it's opening weekend, it was very well done, action packed with modern special effects, yet wholesome enough to have been made in the 1940's where most of this film is set.  I really believed Chris Evans as the hero, his transformation from 90 pound weaking to buff super hero was excellent( a note Mr. Evans did a good job of capuring the cockiness of the Johnny Storm/Human torch charater in the Fantasitc Four movies as well) He is an excellent Steve Rogers. Their is a good supporting cast with Tommy Lee Jones, Staney Tucci and Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull.
0060558121|1.0|After reading all the glowing reviews of this book, I had to give it a shot...<br /><br />This was quite honestly the worst book I have ever read; at no point did I even find this book even slightly interesting.  I somehow managed to finish the book, but with each page I turned, I grew more and more resigned to the fact that the book was simply drivel, and disappointment was inevitable.
B0053YEM7U|3.0|Look, as others reviewing this album have said, I too am predisposed to not like this album...there, I said it right up front. And it's not fair, I'll say that too. It's just the name....Yes. This is not a Yes album, and we all know why. No offense to anyone, but just because you can get a guy named Mo Zart in your band, it still ain't gonna work calling this a new work by Mozart. Likewise, someone who can sing beautiful falsetto still is not Jon Anderson. There is only one. Break away, call it something different..that I can respect. Then I could listen. Jon has given me too much; sorry, I have to stand my ground on this one...to do anything else would be to disgrace someone whose whole life has been devoted to music. Music that has made my heart sing...
159562015X|5.0|Incredible book outlining the longitudinal studies of the Gallup Organization and Dr. Clifton around the strengths that push people to achieve the extraordinary!  I've used it with my teams to not only encourage their goal achievement at work, but at home, & in the community based on their unique strengths.  Strongly recommended by @HerschelT
0553801473|1.0|I loved the first 4 books of the series and expected to love this one.  I didn't. It seemed like the author simply used this as a money making opportunity based on his previous books.  His heart wasn't in it and neither was his story-telling skills.  There were many loose ends left and the ones he attempted to tie up didn't make sense or add to the story-lines.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I was very much impressed with the book in that differentiation in contents, loyal customers using social networking platform are  the key factors for not only  just selling your books but also for everything in the new social networking era.  I wrote 6 books in Japanese and 3 of them were ranked No1 in Amazon Japan as bestsellers, however, this book is MUST BUY  for even bestselling authors.   Great book!
0545123275|2.0|The best thing I can say about this book is that it is very well written and descriptive.    Then, there are the bad things that totally cover up the good.    One is that the book is very repetitive with little to no action what-so-ever. The most action I got out of this book was at the beginning when *SOILER ALERT* Grace is attacked and almost killed by the wolves *END SPOILER*. That is sad, and being an action-y person that I am, I became extremely bored with the book. Chapters became obstacles to read because it repeats itself. Okay, girl likes boy, boy likes girl, but boy turns into a \\"werewolf\\" (not really) when it gets cold. In the age of Twilight, I don't know why I expected so much from a werewolf story.     Not to mention, the characters are very 2D. There is nothing about the characters that make them stand out as individuals. Sam and Grace act exactly like each other: quiet, boring, and flat. I found it very difficult to believe in the characters, and the romance is too much. It overwhelms the story to the point where even their love gets boring. Some things I read just were so ridiculous, repetitive, and frankly made me want to bash my head against a hard surface.     So, to make a long review short: if you want to read a book about nonstop, boring romance, this is the book for you. If you are wanting something action packed, then totally overlook this book.
B004Q7IAQE|5.0|Love this Hello Kitty!!!  The colors are bright and cheerful and a wonderful addition to anyone Hello Kitty collector.
B001NFTZPM|4.0|The outer box was in fair condition. Both openings appeared to have been handled not very delicately, as if someone was rifling through it. However, all discs, inserts, and mask packaging are intact. I haven't checked the quality of the digital copy yet, but I assume it'll rock. Overall, the product's handling is definitely sketchy, but what matters is perfect!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It works great and has lots of options to change allowing you to create as many different alarms as you want that are customized to be exactly the way you want them to be.\nOne down side is that the math questions are not sorted well by difficulty but if you get one that is too hard you can set an option to allow you to pass questions. I have it set on hard and can usually find a problem that is easy enough to solve in the morning by passing only once or twice.
0786838655|4.0|When I first began to read this book, I was upset by the seeming ripoff of Harry Potter, particularly the part with two boys and one girl, the girl being much smarter than the boys. But as I continued to read, I became engaged in the story of Percy Jackson and saw that this was its own story, not an imitation. Perhaps the author was inspired by Harry Potter, but he has made this story his own. I liked the imagination at work here, delving into the Greek gods and their history, traits, and who/what each of them ruled over. It was fun watching the kids try to figure things out. There are enough strange happenings here and enough challenges to keep a reader very satisfied.
0440236738|4.0|Gone for Good is one the most complicated crime stories I've read in quite a while. Its protagonist is Will Klein, whose older brother Ken vanished eleven years ago, on the night of the brutal murder of Will's former high school sweetheart. Everyone except his family assumes Ken is guilty, and Will has never been able to believe that his brother is probably dead. As the story opens, their mother has just died, and in her final hours, she revealed that Ken is indeed alive. The funeral is barely over when Will discovers that his current girlfriend, Sheila, whom he hoped to marry, has walked out on him without a word of warning.<br /><br />From this point forward, Will will be buffeted by one shock after another, most of which are delivered by a childhood acquaintance nicknamed \\"The Ghost\\", who was dangerous back then but is truly deadly now. He knows all about Ken and Sheila, and forces Will to help track his brother down, ostensibly so he can kill him. The Ghost is one of the most diabolical characters ever imagined, and he permeates this story with dark, cold, menace. Will is the narrator, and while he's not exactly unreliable, what he perceives as the truth is usually anything but, mainly because The Ghost provides him with very little detail. As does the FBI agent who's never stopped hunting for Ken. Suffice it to say that this is an exciting, intense novel, with so many unforeseen surprises that the tension never abates. Great fun, perfect for summer.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|This is a film I think people either love or hate and personally I can't understand why the later.  It really does seem to polarize its audience.  As a comparison I watched the Black Swan, which was nominated for 5 Academy awards, and I was very disappointed with the film.  It deals with just as dark a subject and though done well, was not very entertaining and I will not be watching it again. Sucker Punch beats it hands down and if the Academy wasn't so stuffy it would have nominated Sucker Punch for at least 5 if not 8 awards. It is a film that can be enjoyed on many level and I will enjoy watching it many more times.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I use this quite often. It&apos;s fast and easy. It has forceclosed several times but after the last couple of updates I haven&apos;t had any problems.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|Not only is Justin Vernon one of the best songwriters that has ever graced the stage, but he also has an immense talent for putting those words to powerful music that moves you. From the first track, I knew that this album was something magical. This is the kind of music that will ruin other music for you, because you will hear and feel things that your average \\"hits\\" will never do! In short, this album is amazing and will change your life.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|I was so excited to order it and it got here in early time and not a thing wrong with it :)
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The book was quite unusual and quirky which I overall enjoyed. The pictures are hard to see on the kindle and do not adjust in size. This made it particularly hard to read Emma's letter to Jack's father. I could not believe how the book ended. In fact, I could not believe I was suddenly reading a short bit on the photos used in the book and the book had actually ended! I had to go back to make sure the book had, in fact ended! It was like walking off a cliff - ooops, no more terra firma! It just ended and left you free-falling. I am wondering if there is to be a sequel or if this is to be a series. Lots of possibilities with all the talk of time travel at the end. It was a very quick read. It is entertaining as you are reaidng it but as I said, it just then disapears oput from under you leaving you with all kinds of questions. I am not entirely certain if I would recommend it or not although it left me wanting more. Like an appetizer and no dinner.....
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I am not completely in love with this movie but it was a perfectly fine way to spend a couple of hours, and to my mind the casting was darn near perfect.    This may be M. McConaughey's finest acting performance but he operates in a pretty narrow range.  He is great at playing charming sleazeballs, and he plays this one to the hilt.  Marisa Tomei is great at playing luminous but damaged women.  Ryan Philippe is the best of the angel-faced manipulators.  Nice to see Frances Fisher in a small but pivotal role - she is a great aristocratic beauty.  And William H. Macy can play anything, so his part was a particular delight for me.    The story moves along at a good pace.  The milieu is meticulously crafted and feels very authentic.  I think this is a really good summer movie.
B0051QJ83S|2.0|Lady gaga's music is redundant and not very good. I bought this to listen to a few of her singles but they have no staying power and im sick of hearing them alrsady. I only bought this for the amazon discount price of 99¢. Shouldve got britney spears album instead.

B004I506G6|5.0|Every year, I get a new DVD for my 9 year old son for our summer road trips.  Last year, it was the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew from the 1970's and this year it was season one of The Six Million Dollar Man.  Like last year, my kid loved it.  It was nostalgic for me and new for him.  The more '70s stuff I introduce to my kid, the more he likes it.  You forget how slow developing these 70's shows and movies are.  I think my kid will be bored and he's not.  Weird, considering all the fast moving TV of today's standards.  My only knock on this DVD is that it's hard to find and way more expensive than other items similar in nature.  Why this is not released everywhere is beyond me.  My next purchase, season one of Bionic Woman is $27 compared with Six Million Dolllar Man which was $60.
B004V6MWFU|1.0|This was by far the worst CD I have ever listened to. I kept wanting to like it, but it was so painful to proceed on with. I took it out and was going to give it another try the next day thinking I must have been in an off mood......a couple days later I tried it again with even worse results. My garbage can was the only place I could think to put it . I was going to donate it, but felt pretty sure no one would appreciate wasting their money on it.  Yuck.......I am so sorry.
B0031RS64G|5.0|The Malazan Book of the Fallen series is some of the finest epic fantasy every created. It's sprawling, crazy, huge, endlessly creative, and packed full of wonderful, memorable characters.    The start, though, is a little difficult to penetrate. It takes a hundred pages or so before the bombardment relents enough for you to start actually being interested in the characters. I gave up twice on this book, both times around page 75. When I gave it a third try -- on so many friends' recommendations -- I decided to stick, no matter what, to 200 or so. By the time I got there, it was so good that I'd almost forgotten I was reading.     It's wonderful stuff. Stick with it. It's worth it.
0061784788|4.0|I look forward to reading all of James Rollins' books once he announces them. But when I read on his blog that his latest was going to reveal a secret about the founding of our country, a secret tied to the Book of Mormon, the anticipation level went up a few notches for me. As an LDS person, and one who has read the Book of Mormon numerous times, I couldn't help but smile at the thought of what Rollins might try to do.<br /><br />The adventure begins in the Uintah Mountains of Eastern Utah, where two Native American teenagers are searching for a cave, a cave they've been warned against entering by the elders of their tribe. What they find in that cave sets off an explosion, but it's a unique explosion, one that gets the attention of Painter Crowe and the others working for Sigma - a covert division of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and one that sets off a chain reaction that could end life on earth as we know it.<br /><br />Now, let me give my opinion about the ties to the Book of Mormon and the beliefs of the LDS church that are described in the book. The belief of members of the LDS Church is that the Book of Mormon is a record of the ancestors of the Native Americans who were themselves descendants of one of the lost ten tribes of Israel and who left Jerusalem approximately 600 B.C.. In The Devil Colony, part of the historical aspect of the book centers around a tribe of \\"pale skinned\\" Indians who came from the East, who kept records on golden plates in a writing that has its roots in the Hebrew language, and who possessed some sort of magical power that scared the other tribes and ultimately led to their being killed off.<br /><br />In the book, Rollins explains that there are two different sets of beliefs within the LDS church. One is the belief that all those currently referred to as Native Americans are descendants of those Israelites whose history is contained in the Book of Mormon. He tells how DNA testing of these tribes has thus far shown that that isn't the case, instead tying their lineage to Asia. But he also describes the more current set of beliefs among many, including myself, and that is that the people and events contained in the Book of Mormon, represent only a small and possibly isolated portion of the Americas.<br /><br />To his credit, Rollins obviously did his research on the what the Book of Mormon is and how it came about. He did mess up in one paragraph when he referred to Joseph Smith as John Smith a couple of times, but I forgive him for that since he got it right everywhere else.<br /><br />Bottom line is it was a lot of fun to read. His stories are always fast-paced rides that I devour quickly, but this one was even more enjoyable because of the Mormon angle and because a lot of it takes place here in Utah, on the campus of BYU, and other places I know well.t the case, instead tying their lineage to Asia.

B002JODUI4|4.0|There were a few good songs on this album but nothing amazing. I still would recommend it to my friends.
0765324849|5.0|!!WARNING!!  This book is a prequel to the games, but DO NOT read this book before playing them (Why haven't you played them yet???).  It will give away certain \\"details\\" that the player should not know about when playing the games.  This holds especially true for the first BioShock.  I won't mention any of these spoilers in this review, so read on...<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much when my copy of BioShock:Rapture arrived in the mail, but I consider myself a pretty big fan of the series and the idea of a prequel in print was enough to make me preorder it.  I was not disappointed... far from it in fact.<br /><br />If you've played the BioShock games then you know a great deal of the storytelling is done via audio diaries.  These audio diaries are exactly what they sound like... the audio recorded thoughts of those that lived in Rapture.  As you progress through the games you discover these recordings scattered about here and there.  Each diary contains a small piece of a puzzle; a very dark puzzle that paints a picture of what took place in Rapture.  From these diaries we learn of some of the horrible experiences of its citizens, as well as the events that ultimately caused its downfall.  John Shirley does an extraordinary job of tying these diaries together into a novel that really fleshes out the story of Rapture.<br /><br />In bringing these diaries together, Shirley takes side-characters from the games and gives our brief encounters with them more meaning.  People that had small cameos from the games are given new life as you see the events that led to their fate in greater detail and from different angles.  Not every character is given as much attention as others, but overall I was very satisfied.<br /><br />I'm a very big BioShock fan so I'll admit that I might have some bias, but I'm trying to look at the book as objectively as I can.  As one other reader mentioned, there are many different POVs.  I can see where one might feel that some of these don't quite fit when considering the book by itself, as they serve little purpose to move the story along at times and can seem out of place.  But for those that experienced the games, these \\"teasers\\" that seem unnecessary are actually a prelude for what came afterward.  They're more fan-service than anything else; Shirley even dedicated the book itself to the fans of BioShock and BioShock 2.  In addition to the spoilers the book contains, this is another reason I strongly suggest reading the book only AFTER you have played the games.  These different POVs will be more familiar to you and will likely be more appreciated if you've played the games.  That's my opinion anyway.<br /><br />The only other issue I could see some readers possibly having is that the book definitely doesn't read like your everyday novel... it's choppy and jumps around, taking place over the entire decade that housed the rise and fall of Rapture (430 pages to cover 14 years, actually).  I had no problem with this myself; the story was still very easy to follow and flowed well.<br /><br />Bottom line... this book was a great read and it has me wanting to play through both games all over again!  If you are a fan of BioShock then I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />UPDATE: The BioShock Ultimate Rapture Edition is out!  $29.99 gets you both BioShock and BioShock 2, including all their DLCs!te fit when considering the book by itself, as they serve little purpose to move the story along at times and can seem out of place.

B002R68U7K|5.0|I've purchased this product as a gift to my boyfriend, and it is a wonderful collection for the ones who admire the work of Mrs Spears. I recommend this as an item of collector, even because it`s becoming harder and harder to find them to be bought.
B004SGWYW4|3.0|I'm going to try to keep this to about a paragraph, because its about as far as the depth of this series went for me.This anime, which I started watching without any prior knowledge from the comics, has a few things going for it and a few that they do not.The good-The animation is nice and fluid, with an occasional 3-d scene. The voice acting is also done well. Side characters tend to react realistically to the situations at hand.The bad-While it is fun to see someone jump onto a bridge with a motorcycle,along with other fun action sequences, nobody else in this universe does anything as cool as the main characters in fight scenes.Not even the military.The gigantic-The breasts.Everywhere.This goes into the bad portion also, because while it was funny for the stupid blonde to be stacked and actually have a wobble sound effect when she moved, there are entire sections, one taking up almost a full episode, just to have them in there.Its not a porno, but its more then enough.  For what its worth, its a fun litle show to watch, but if it has a sequel or a movie, I'd probably not check it out.
0553801473|2.0|I eagerly awaited the fifth book in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, A Dance with Dragons, but after reading almost 1000 pages, I was left disappointed and discontented.  Although he has created an intricate world with multi-faceted characters in this series, if Martin wants to hold on to his faithful readers, he must do the following: speed up the pace of the plot, quit rewarding the despicable characters, and stop torturing, killing, or constraining the decent ones.  I have been a faithful reader for more than a decade, but Martin's obsession with the idea that \\"good guys always come in last\\" is growing tiresome.  I get it.  The world here is ruthless and brutal, but must I be knocked over the head with that notion constantly and relentlessly?  This is one reader who is ready for the good guys to start kicking butt and taking names.  I don't think that's too much to ask.

B000QUUD60|5.0|This video shows what Elvis, The Entertainer was. Not his other movies, not the band, not all the songs. This shows the control he had over a performance. You will not find anything else as good. Close seconds would be his 68 Comeback and Aloha from Hawaii. Now I'm waiting for the Blu-Ray !
0345529057|2.0|I read the first book, and will not read the others.  Changing a letter per word does not create a new word, nor changing the map of England slightly make it a new place.  Not a new world, just a recreated old one.  Then, when you're settled into that mode, it spins too far into the realm of fantasy.  The ending threw me - convinced me I won't read the rest of the series.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|This game brings a few new aspects that I haven't seen in the handful of other tower defense games I've tried:<br />1. The zombies constantly switch routes and occasionally you have different packs of zombies going different routes simultaneously.<br />2. Killed zombies occasionally drop powerups like money, freeze bombs that slow down opponents temporarily, and the most interesting of all is the upgrade powerup.  The upgrade powerup levels up all of your units within a short radius of it but those units go out of commission for a few seconds while they upgrade.  It makes for some tough decisions of losing use of a few units for a few seconds vs. saving hundreds of dollars on upgrades.<br />3. The choice of units at your disposal changes with ever level.  In some levels, your only choices are a handful of slow, powerful, and expensive units.  The makes the placement and selection of units very tricky since it may be some time before you have the funds to build another one.<br />4. The money tower.  It's a tower that gives you bonus money for any units killed within its range.  A great way to increase your rate of money accrual but it also ties up the limited spots you have available for weapons.
B003L20ICE|2.0|I hated this movie, but not because of the subject matter, rather I hated the acting by the Hollywood superstars (so predictable, not genuine or believable at all) and I really hated the disrespectful way the topic of same sex marriage/relationships was handled.  It was so cliche' and felt very disrespectful.  The material was there, but the director and the actors flubbed it.  My favorite part of this movie was the development of the relationship between father and daughter.  That felt real and authentic and likely, although I find it hard to believe that a guy who was so seemingly immature could be such a successful entrepreneur in today's volatile consumer market.  I was also not thrilled with all the gratuitous sex that seemed to be thrown in just to hold our attention when the acting couldn't.   Such a disappointment!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am going to the Cayman Islands in 3 1\2 weeks .. My daughter and I challenged each other 19 days ago to do the JM Shredd DVDs and in only 19 days we are both toned and can actually see muscle definition.  My one recommendation would be to push yourself, as when you are alone working out it's much easier to take the modification, but you will really see results if you push. Short DVDs make it easy to fit in daily!! No excuses-start today. I just bought Ripped in 30 which is Jillians new DVD series and it is also interval training and difficult. Love them!! 3 1/2 more weeks and I'll be ripped!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books.  Brooks writing style is smooth and entertaining.  All of the short stories are interesting and further the all around theme of the book.  Each character's story is different and fresh, making the book a quick read and never really slowing the story down.  I have read this book multiple times and will probably read it a few more.  Loved it!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Room is a beautifully composed novel, despite the fact that a five year old boy is telling the whole thing.<br /><br />The first half of the book is the best. You will not be able to put it down. Emma Donoghue is a master at making you sympathize with her lovable but helpless characters... even when I wasn't reading, I couldn't help thinking about little Jack's welfare. The second half of the novel, however, is tedious and does not have the same effect. But, if you're able to push past the mostly tolerable errors, you're in for a heartbreakingly satisfying ending.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|For those of us who have enjoyed Firefly, we left the series yearning for a few key answers. The plot of Serenity picks up a few months, it seems, after the end of the series. We quickly see that River is serving as the voice of the film and we watch from her eyes as things go from complicated, to disturbing and then downright terrifying. No spoilers here, but for my money, the film answers all the questions you might have had lingering.<br /><br />If you are still left wanting, there's a few graphic novels and a role-playing game that share this 'verse.<br /><br />The film was gorgeous on DVD format, and on Blu-Ray, it sweeps through scenes in details some viewers may have missed. And the sound in 5.1 systems was impressive in DVD format, but there are a few scenes that ratchet up better than the DVD (at least, that's how it sounds to me). The special features are incredible, including a few 'sessions' as River experienced at the hand of the Alliance. The bulk of these features are included on the special edition of the DVD, but the Blu-Ray includes a few U-Control tidbits not seen before.<br /><br />And for non-fans watching the film for the first time, watch it with subtitles on. That way you can catch the lightning-like banter at the start of the film. That alone tells you everything you need to know about the background. I would also suggest that if you were contemplating upgrading to the Blu-Ray, to do so with expedience. This is one you won't regret.
B004OEIL5E|4.0|i watched the first scream movie awhile back and thought,\\"i need to see what happens in the sequel!\\" In scream 2, a new set of murders are being played out at local college based on the fictionial movie 'Stab',which is the basis of the first set of murders in woodboro. sydney from the first movie goes to school there to start fresh after learning that her boyfriend and another friend killed her mom(they might've raped her or made it appear she was raped), framed her mom's lover cotton weary, savagely murdered their friends, including their principle and a camera man. oh, they kidnapped her dad in attempt to frame him for their crimes. but now, a new killer is taking up the ghostface mantle. who is the killer this time around? i not saying anything but all i can say is watch it from beginning to end.
159514188X|5.0|Rarely to you hear a story that isn't blaming the person who committed suicide. Jay Asher gives us a peek inside the mind of the one who falls victim to depression and suicide. It was well written and had me hooked on every word. This book makes you understand the effect your words have on people.
B0055D3EOG|1.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie.  Reviews seemed to suggest a good horror movie.  The first half of the movie seemed as if it was heading in that direction.  Had a creepy feel to it, similar to Paranormal activity.  Then the pace of the movie changed completely.  It was if they switched directors mid movie, the change was that dramatic.  It went from creepy horror with promise to corny cheesey, b-movie wanna be.  I won't post an spoilers incase people still decide they want to continue with watching, but be warned.  The scariest thing about this movie is how scary bad it got towards the end!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I read this book in two days. It was such a sad story, but a must read! Be for warned that it does get a bit graphic as she goes into detail about Philip and the things he did to her. A story with a happy ending though, worth the money it cost!
B004KAB5PU|4.0|This book is excellently illustrated and has clear and easy to follow written instructions. The clarity of the illustrations is outstanding and the section dealing with composition was something of an added bonus. The colour swatches, for those who prefer to use a different make of paint, was an excellent idea. I would temper this review with stating that, in my opnion, it is suitable for an experienced beginner who is moving into intermediate skills. Ths book arrived quite promptly considering I live in New Zealand and was well packed. I am glad I bought it.

B004P4S4NM|5.0|Do yourself a favor.  Buy Adele's 21.  It's unforgettable and timeless. I fell in love with Adele with \\"Chasing Pavements.\\"  I was like, \\"who is this girl??\\" when I first heard her on the radio.  Her voice..amazing.<br /><br />I love every song in this album.  But, there are a couple of songs in Adele's 21 that really struck a chord in me.<br /><br />\\"Rolling In the Deep\\" - You start a song with \\"There's a fire starting in my heart<br />Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark..\\" - how can you go wrong?<br /><br />\\"Turning Tables\\" - This is my \\"I'm moving on\\" song.  This one is an emotional healer.  Most memorable lyric?  \\"Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior, When the thunder calls for me, Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior, Standing on my own two feet.\\"  I mean, c'mon.  I couldn't have put those words any better.<br /><br />\\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" - Sexy. You have to listen to this a few times.  This wasn't one of my favorites earlier on.  But it really grew on me.  There's just so much passion in this song - you can't help but listen to it over and over.<br /><br />I can't wait for Adele's next one.

B002ZG98G4|2.0|\\"Morning Glory\\" seems like a despicable film.  It's the brainchild of seasoned rom-com pro Aline Brosh McKenna, who was also responsible for writing \\"Laws of Attraction,\\" with Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore, \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" with Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway, and \\"27 Dresses,\\" with Katherine Heigl.  McKenna knows what makes today's Hollywood rom-coms, but more importantly, she knows what gets today's rom-coms made.  \\"Morning Glory\\" is a well-constructed script: it follows the tried-and-old formula of the modern rom-com, while also leaving the possibility of snagging big talent (and thus a bigger audience)--in this case, Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford.    Rachel McAdams stars as a 28-year-old working for a New Jersey morning show, who's dreamed of getting into big-time broadcast journalism since she was 8.  She gets fired from her Jersey morning show and receives a brutally cold lecture from her mother, but she immediately begins a desperate search for a new job.  She gets one, by impressing a big-wig exec played by Jeff Goldblum: she's the new executive-producer on the cruddy morning show Daylight.  There's no need to waste time explaining what happens from there, or the challenges she faces.  One can see it coming.    What I didn't see coming was McKenna's wrong-mindedness.  Harrison Ford plays a Walter-Cronkite-quality news anchor who gets fired and winds up contractually bound to Daylight.  He insists on covering real news stories, things of national or international importance.  He's supposed to seem an \\"a--hole\\" for doing so, for not providing the trivial, superficial entertainment Daylight viewers expect.  McAdams informs him that the battle between entertainment and news is over: \\"Entertainment won.\\"  Are we supposed to laugh at the declaration?  How can any intelligent person see Ford's ideas as being that of an old fuddy-duddy, as McKenna does?    McAdams' character's achievement is raising the ratings for Daylight and turning it into a show about which people care.  She does so by transforming the show into an entertainment hour, in which the weather forecaster is forced to endure a new rollercoaster or skydiving and Diane Keaton's character has to sumo wrestle and kiss a frog.  She's raised the ratings, which makes her some kind of success, and that's nice because Rachel McAdams is a likable actor--but she's done so by shirking journalistic duty for sensational, goofy entertainment.  Why would we applaud this?    McKenna's script just gets more simple-minded from there.  Characters have sudden, inexplicable changes of heart, for the sake of convenient plotting.  She spends an hour showing us how stubborn and obnoxious Ford's character can be, then gives him an apparently complete turnaround in 15 minutes.  We get a nice shot of McAdams' character's mother, the insensitive, cruel one, proudly hanging a news clipping about McAdams' success.  Why do we care?  Does this really make us happy?  She isn't proud of McAdams: she's proud of McAdams' success.      Why is McAdams' character attracted to Patrick Wilson's lazy upper-level magazine series journalist?  McKenna tells us it's because he puts up with her, but aren't there tens of thousands of men in the world who would be willing to put up with McAdams' character, let alone McAdams herself?  Isn't it possible someone might not just tolerate the character, but love her for her drive or her eccentricities--you know, the human stuff?    Not in McKenna's manufactured world, which fortunately has little to do with life as I know it.  Rom-coms are usually devoid of characters or storylines with human quality, since the genre itself relies on superficial targets to elicit its audience's pleasure.  But they can still be lively (\\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\"), or clever (anything by Judd Apatow), or even meaningful (\\"Definitely, Maybe\\").  \\"Morning Glory\\" is none of the above.  It's as familiar as the formula of \\"Sesame Street,\\" without such good intentions.  It seems asthough one owns the piano score on a dozen different soundtrack CDs.    There is one redeeming feature of \\"Morning Glory\\" (although there should be two: Diane Keaton is surprisingly misused): Harrison Ford, whose performance is unfathomably fun, funny, and emotional considering the shallowness of the material.  Hollywood is really enjoying itself, milking Mr. Ford for his Grumpy Old Man quality, but in this movie, his sulking curmudgeonly performance makes all the difference in the world--the world being the thing about which \\"Morning Glory\\" doesn't know a thing, nor care.
B0050PLT8W|1.0|What a disappointment.  In the beginning, Theory of A Deadman had some really good tunes.  The older the cd the better.  THEN, they got a<br />taste of Rock/Pop Commericalism and decided that commercializing ALL their music is $$$$$ in the bank.  Noooo....you lost me.  Please go<br />back to your roots...that is probably what the band really likes to play anyway....Don't give in to \\"Da Man\\" !
159514188X|4.0|The author describes this as being in the suspense genre, and I would agree.  While it's clear from the dust jacket that the book revolves around the reasons why a bright high school student committed suicide, the author nonetheless does a great job of building up the tension behind the \\"justification\\" for the suicide.      My only complaint - and I hate to sound preachy - is that there's not enough talk in the book about the true negatives of suicide. At no time do you see how the main character's death affected her parents or family, or the other people in her life who truly loved her. I would hate for a kid to read this and feel like suicide is a great way to get back at some minor person in their life that hurt them - because in the book it almost does seem like suicide was an effective way for the main character to lash out.  I don't want to say the book glorifies suicide, but for someone a bit on edge already, it might not be such a beneficial read.

B000N3T0DW|5.0|Some films actually have the ability to change your entire perception of something, and `Volver' is one of those films.  It is the perfect blend of direction, acting and script that make for a pitch perfect film that towers over the rest with originality and authenticity.  It is a film that feels so soulful and realized in such a marvelous way.  What makes `Volver' extra moving is the fact that it never plays too heavily into its own weight themes but allows them to evolve and move with a realistic fluidity.  There is humor to be found in the light touches used on the more thematic elements at play.  Even when disastrous events are mentioned, it is never overdone but is remarkably balanced and effective.<br /><br />Almodovar found a marvelous balance for his telenovela style and the more dramatic prose instigated with this film.<br /><br />In `Volver' we are introduced to the vivacious yet suppressed Raimunda.  Raimunda is a young mother who is raising her daughter Paula with her drunk of a husband Paco.  Paco is a deadbeat of sorts and their marriage isn't very united.  When Paco attacks Paula in a drunken lusting rage, she kills him, leaving her mother to hide the body and take responsibility (what any good mother would do).  In the process of this atrocity, Raimunda's world is twisting in turning in ways unbeknownst to her.  Her mother, who died in a fire some years ago, has recently began `appearing' to Raimunda's sister Sole shortly after the death of their aunt Paula.  Their childhood friend Agustina, recently diagnosed with cancer, is aching to know the truth of her mother's disappearance and requests that Raimunda seek out her mother's ghost to ask her about it.  On top of all of this, Raimunda is trying to keep Paco's death a secret and run a restaurant.<br /><br />There is a lot on her plate!<br /><br />The greatest thing about `Volver' is the marvelous cast, all of whom really fall into their respective roles with a sharp sense of knowing and really deliver fully fleshed out characters.  Carmen Maura is excellent as Raimunda's mother, especially in her closing scenes; her deft emotional understanding elevating the simplest touch.  Blanca Portillo and Lola Duenas are also sublime, layering sharp humor with their character's emotional arcs.  But, this film belongs to Penelope Cruz; an actress that I had never really considered `good' until she was `great'.  Truth remains that until 2006, Cruz was a marginally attractive Spanish actress who muddled through English language films by playing a sexy siren and was most known for her friendship with Salma Hayek.  2006 came out of nowhere and all of a sudden the American public was introduced to her native language performances and she suddenly became not just `good' but `great' in almost everything (I'm on the fence about `Nine').  Cruz is beyond sensational here, managing to play her sexy curves without overselling anything.  She grapples the delicacies of her performance by underlining sharp emotional burst with contemplative stares as opposed to loud hysterics.  She also understands that soap operatic undertone that Almodovar created here, playing to the humor as well as the drama.<br /><br />Key to the film's success is the script, and what a beautifully fleshed out script it is.  The tension is perfectly balanced and the relationships and revelations revealed are all in toe with one another, resulting in a refreshing take on a neo-noir; something that is relevant and nostalgic simultaneously.<br /><br />Bravo!Carmen Maura is excellent as Raimunda's mother, especially in her closing scenes; her deft emotional understanding elevating the simplest touch.

B000G8NXYG|3.0|I have mixed feelings about Seven Samurai, why? Probably due to the length of the film,Yes it looks beautiful,the settings,the black and white,but nearing 3 hours?  Maybe I can't appreciate a Non-American(Or Foreign to me) Film,It has good acting and fight scenes,but I actually liked 13 assassins(a Much later and contemporary film that of course for artistic measure can't compare and it is even more brutally violent.)Somehow will fawn over the \\"artistic\\" values,I would have too,albeit if it was under the nearly 3hours,and not as slow paced.
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|I was drawn to the story from the minute i read what it's about. I then started reading and i'm obsessed about the whole book. The characters felt so real and i loved the spanish that was intertwined into the book. I loved that the book was from alternative view points as you can really understand the characters. Alex is my ideal bad boy and Brittany was perfectly described. Their love was something i wish to have one day.    This book might sound predictable but throughout the whole story i was grabbed into another world. It truly felt like i was there. This is a perfect read!!!
B004WCTLNY|1.0|Gosh, this was the worst rewriting of Romeo and Juliet I've ever seen. It was embarrassing to watch, even if the actor and actress were dressed up in hipster clothes. Only if you live in Williamsburg, New York City, are you likely to find anything at all to relate to in this boring, slow, poorly written and altogether predictable flick.<br />The only question: Why in the world did Matt Damon ever agree to make it? Surely he's not that hard up?
B003UESJHE|1.0|Like many popular movies, the studio has larded so much new copy protection that the disc player manufacturers -- companies that still think they are hardware companies and not integrators + software developers -- have fallen behind in being able to keep up. Disk inserts into my late model player, plays some previews, but can't play the movie. I try to update the player to see if it helps, but the software on my player is incapable of completing its upgrade operation. As consumers we lack any mechanism to punish the studios for ruining our plans for the evening. Had the same experience trying to watch Avatar. Time to give up on Blu ray, I think.    I hear its a good film though.
0679737456|3.0|I wanted to like this book. I really did. I had heard Lorene Cary speak at a conference, and she was incredibly inspiring. The way she spoke, she sounded like an amazing writer, and so I was excited to pick up this book, the first work by Cary that I have had a chance to read. It simply did not live up to my expectations.    Cary does do some great things with language in this memoir. Many descriptions are beautifully poetic, and the metaphor of black ice is one that will stick with me. But there were also many flaws in this book, the greatest being that I feel as though she did not do enough to let the reader in. Perhaps I expect more from memoirs, but one of the reasons I enjoy reading them so much is for the insights writers share when they look back on the experiences they choose to write about. Memoir can allow for great intimacy between writer and reader, and Cary just does not do that here. Perhaps distancing herself was intentional, but it was not a tactic that worked for me. She does a good job describing the black female experience in a world that was previously all-white, all-male, but I feel like she could have gone deeper, as far as how she personally felt about the particular aspects of her life that she chose to share. Coming-of-age stories are ones I naturally gravitate to, as there is so much emotion to explore in that adolescent experience, and in my opinion, Cary only skimmed the surface. She couldn't break through the black ice the book is named for, so the experiences she writes about seem a bit watered-down.    I also had a hard time keeping track of some of the characters. Many of her schoolmates in particular appeared so fleetingly, and weren't developed enough, so that I found myself paging backwards to remind myself who some of them were. Her family members were a bit more memorable, and I thought the stories about her grandparents were particularly of interest, but I would have liked to have known even more about her relationships with them. There were just too many missed opportunities, and so while this book is a quick read, and is valuable for the perspective of a young black female that Cary shares with us, in the end I can only rate this book as average.
1451629184|4.0|I bought this book and read the entire thing in one sitting. My heart goes out to Jaycee Dugard for the unimaginable things she survived. The writing is not the best and the details of her abuse were disturbing, but I couldn't put it down.
B003UESJEM|4.0|In the current economy downsizing and it's repercussions are certainly relevant.   For the most part it's well written, directed and acted.   The theatrical ending however tied things up a bit too neatly ,and  for me, rang false.   The alternate ending on the DVD is a bit more ambiguous and felt more realistic.  Ben Affleck and Tommy Lee Jones stand our among a strong cast.   Recommended for rental if you are not a fan of a particular  member of the cast.
0553801473|2.0|First three books were brilliant. However, the last two......not so much.  Like General George McClellan, who created the Army of the Potomac, but was afraid to actually use it; Mr. Martin is getting a reputation as an author who is brilliant at the set up, but is afraid to get on with the story.<br /><br />He seems to have cliff hanger syndrome.....or simply wants the story to drag on forever, for reasons only he can answer - concise story telling is not one of the reasons, money may be.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I am aware that as a customer I should not be saying this but the developer of this game is short changing itself by practically giving it away. Super well thought out,  incredibly well designed,  very easy on the eyes.  Very gentle learning curve and it does get quite challenging as you advance in levels.  Absolutely recommend.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|It is the best rock album I have heard in years. Fantastic lyrics and tunes. The album catches your attention on a first listen and then grows better with each listening. My favourite song on this album is 'Arlandria' but the entire album is so good. Kudos to the group. They went back to basics and produced a one of the kind album. This will be the album to beat at the next Grammys.
B00505470O|4.0|Very wide, deep, space-filling overwaves of stringlike synth sound emulating an 80s panoramic. Slow beats, drifty vocal. Three fat chords per song, shimmered glossily through atmospheric mixes. A whitewalled gallery art opening of your mind, sub-minimal boutique soundtrack for the mirror view zensuit.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The title of this review tells it all.  Martin is a great storyteller but a bad book writer.  He just seems to write until he's bored then sells it as a book.  Where are his editors??? I'm not sure if I could read another one - it would be such a diaappointment to read for days and make little to no progress.  Of course, given how long it took to get this one out, I may not have to make that decision.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|Just got the DVD today.I already watched the movie but I want a copy to add to my collection with the books.I just read the books and it is true,the movie is different from the book.But to see it come to life is exciting!All the actors who played Percy,Annabeth,Grover and Luke were great!And I couldn't imagine anybody else playing Chiron/Mr.Brunner but Pierce Brosnan.He is perfect for it!Hope to see the rest of the books come to life.
0316044695|5.0|I have always loved warrior ethos, and love a good book on the subject, whether fiction or non-fiction. LONE SURVIVOR doesn't disappoint.    Whether Luttrell is relating the grueling process of becoming a SEAL, or his horrific battle in Afghanistan, you'll never, never forget the images. A testament to just how much a determined human being can withstand in the name of a cause.    Marcus Luttrell has a burning hatred of liberals, and as a liberal, that saddens me terribly. He believes that we would rather see him and his mates get fragged into a thousand pieces rather than to shoot Taliban sympathizers. This is simply not true. At the risk of presuming i know what goes on inside the head of a valiant soldier, I don't think he let those sheep herders go because he was afraid of liberal persecution. I think that Mr. Luttrell is a  SEAL, but first he is a human being with a conscience, and compassion. The terrible thing about war is that actions which are not acceptable in society become acceptable in a war, and the human psyche has an awful time trying to deal with that. We simply are not wired to kill others, it is a discipline which must be learned.     I would love to sit down with Marcus Luttrell and tell him we liberals don't come out of the same mold. Some of us understand. But most of all, I'd thank him for his service.     Get the hardcover version of this book, because it deserves a place on your shelf, not just a place in the ether of your kindle or iPad.
0553801473|2.0|Considering all of the Anthologies and such that Martin has been the Editor for it seems a stroke of irony that he really could have used an Editor to make the most recent two books in this once amazing series coherent. As others have said, the events A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons could have easily been one novel as originally planned. Instead we got a lot of Jordan-esque blocks of minutia and story arcs that go literally nowhere. I found myself skipping through half of the chapters as I had to start doing with Jordan's later novels. Needless to say, I did not enjoy the walls of detail he put forth in this effort and I kind of feel I spent money on a book about food and catchphrases when I thought I had bought the next Novel in ASoIaF.<br /><br />It was worth it only because while Martin kind of fell flat with this one, the series as a whole is still better than 95% of anything else in fantasy right now. Hopefully it doesn't take seven years for the next installment and Martin can bounce back into form.
0143039482|4.0|This was John Steinbeck's last novel and the one that won him a Nobel Prize for Literature.  Most people acknowledge that this was not his best work (in my mind not up to the standards of East of Eden or Of Mice and Men), but as with the Academy Awards, sometimes an Oscar for lifetime achievement is merited.<br /><br />The story is set in an old whaling village on the tip of Long Island (think Sag Harbor), where we find Ethan Allen Hawley, descended from an illustrious local family and recently suffering from financial reverses so severe that he has taken the menial job of grocery clerk.  Day after day, Hawley is bombarded by reminders of his families prosperous past and the relative poverty in which he finds himself, most annoyingly by his wife, son and daughter.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Hawley plays the naïve, unambitious simpleton, while at the same time engineering his return to prosperity and riches through a series of cold blooded, calculating and ruthless maneuvers.  Relatively entertaining and worthwhile, it nevertheless fails to measure up to some of Steinbeck's better work.

0553801473|5.0|Here is the latest cliffhanger du jour from George R.R. Martin, the fifth in the\\" A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. Hopefully I don't have to wait six years till the sixth book,The Winds of Winter comes out, although I have to say the wait was worth it for this novel. Many questions and mysteries from previous books are solved, but a host of new puzzling chapter endings crop up. When I read this series, I feel like I'm a kid again watching the Flash Gordon serials in the movies on Saturday.<br /><br />This book runs parallel with A Feast for Crows up to a point. It follows the characters from the north and across the narrow sea till about page 593, when the time frame reunites both books. This book brings the reader up to date on: Tyrion, Daenerys, King Stannis, Jon Snow, Bran Stark, Davos Seaworth and Theon Greyjoy, now called Reek. Arya Stark reenters the novel on page 593, Jaime Lannister on 632, Brienne of Tarth on 646, Cersei on 717, and Victarion Greyjoy on page 741. Surprisingly Sansa Stark and Littlefinger are not in the novel at all, even though they are living in the north.<br /><br />Since it has been so long between novels, I found myself constantly going to the internet to refresh my memory on certain characters. In retrospect, I think it's a good idea to review the four previous books before attempting to read this one. This book is also filled with new characters, especially in The Free Cities, Valyria and Beyond the Wall. How Martin can keep up with all the strange names from all the Sellsword companies, the people in Meereen and Yunkai is beyond me. It is a bit annoying trying to remember who Yurkhaz Zo Yunzak is, or Reznak Mo Reznak for example. There are many heroes in this novel and numerous scrofulous villains, new and old.<br /><br />One thing to remember about George Martin is that he plays no favorites when it comes time for a hero, or villain to die. My one caveat is that this happens multiple times, or does it? The innuendos are astonishing through out the book.<br /><br />The last thing to mention is that you can tell by the book's title, the dragons are finally involved! I will not tell you what part Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal play in this book, but it is a big one. This was a pleasure to read, my only regret is that I have finished it!

B000UDNBQW|4.0|Mr. Pip is a deeply engaging tale of life on the unstable island of Bougainville for Matilda, the narrator and main character, a young native black girl, recounting the events that ultimately shaped her views of life, morality and the world beyond her home. The main focus for much of the story is on Matilda's schooling and her teacher Mr. Watts, the last white man on the island. Married to a native, Watts is a mystery to Matilda whose primary glimpses of the man are when he's pulling his wife in a cart along the island, wearing a red clown nose. Watts uses Dickens' 'Great Expectations' as his main teaching material, reading passages aloud to the children, emphasizing the power and magic of storytelling. Watts' enthusiasm for the novel is infectious, wrapping both the reader and Matilda up in worlds far from their own, while bit by bit revealing his own history along the way.    There are strong political, familial and moral undercurrents throughout the novel, but ultimately the story is one of discovery; a young girl finding her place, her faith and her own truth amidst the turmoil around her.    I found the plot to be extremely engaging, the characters relatable and interesting, and Jones' writing manages to be both sparse and descriptive in the same measure, keeping you in the moment even when the unexpected bits of violence might otherwise turn you away. There were moments I truly didn't expect, revelations that raised more questions than gave answers, and I did find the concluding chapters to be a little out-of-the-blue on the first reading, not because it was unexpected but because the time and setting jumps threw me a bit out of the experience.    Overall, a very worthwhile and thought-provoking read. Possibly the biggest compliment I can give this novel is that as soon as I finished reading, I picked up my copy of 'Great Expectations' and discovered again the type of magic that both Matilda and Watts also found in its pages.
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|App works wonderfully with .avi, .mkv, and plenty of other file types. Set up is rather difficult and the desktop software for windows is clunky at best. Once library is scanned into the desktop player though, streaming works well. HD streaming requires a pc built in the last 2 or 3 years. 3g streaming works if you have a good upload speed for your media. Haven&apos;t been able to stream content while connected to a non-lan wifi network. Desktop software seems to update frequently. \n\nWorth $2. Not yet worth $5.

B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, and the user interface is smooth and responsive on my Evo. I downloaded the ad supported version on gerjar.com, but I would gladly pay $.99 if that was my only option.\n\nThe game is simple to figure out, but it&apos;s not so easy as to be boring. Some levels are tricky and require precise timing in order to complete successfully.\n\nI&apos;m patiently waiting for the developer to update the Android version to include the latest box (Toy Box). The update for the iPhone came out a week or so ago, but Android has gotten no love so far.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|First movie was way to slow, way too boring, quite depressive. this one is more for the older kid to adults. has an espionage theme to it ( ala bond) cool funny jokes, non-stop action, and 90 % of its all about mater. ive never liked mcqueen that much, his personality is not that fun anyway. as for the cons, i found the movie to be in the stereotipical side. asian cars are small,mater of course its the typical redneck, theres a part were mater turns into a taco truck & says something in spanish, that sort of thing. if you get offended by this sort of thing, not the best choice. its all done in the light of humor, so overcome it & laugh about it. way better than first, i wish the 1st never existed but thats just me.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|I purchased this cable so that I can output the display on my iPhone 4 onto an in-dash Pioneer navigation screen which I'll be installing soon. The cable itself is well-built like with most Apple products. I tested the capabilities out by hooking it up to my home Denon receiver outputted to my HD Samsung TV. Works flawlessly with Apple certified apps (iPod, YouTube, etc.) You'll need to double check with other apps though to see if it's compatible. Since I've jailbroken my iPhone 4 I installed the TVOut application and it works great to display everything on the iPhone 4 screen to any external display which accepts composites. I didn't want to try the other cheaper generic cables and spent the extra money on the genuine product and I'm happy with the results.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|I'm barely getting into all this anime fuzz but when I saw this one I was amazed!!!

B0027LZ4CE|5.0|I am throughly amazed (at the low cost) and satisfied at the beauty of the contents of this particular box of symphonies.  I have other complete sets including Wand, Karajan, and Eugen Jochum (Dresden and Berlin), and this compilation can hold its head high - it is superb conducting by a hitherto unknown conductor to me - Roberto Paternostro. Powerful when it needs to be, light when it needs to be.  This conductor is a genius when skillfully guiding the orchestra through the Bruckner symphonies which I understand are very difficult to get just right. It is \\"right\\" for me! I enjoyed it so well that I've purchased two sets to give to friends who are Bruckner affectionados. Incidentally, this set is shipped from Germany, by Airmail, and it arrived in my mail box in a matter of days(I requested the no-cost shipping) - obviously it is packed upon receipt of order, and is delivered as quickly as the post office can do it.
0062515675|5.0|At a time when I was re-evaluating my career, this book was one of the keys to making my next move. It's a parable that will strike a chord with all the people who have, in the words of Zig Ziglar, \\"climbed to the top of the ladder to find it's leaning against the wrong wall.\\"    Seriously, get this thing and read it. It's that good.

B002SQ364Q|1.0|Perhaps Ang Lee had some unfinished work after directing \\"Crouching Tiger...\\" or \\"Hulk?\\"  So he decided to apply a cartoon mentality to the reality of Woodstock?  All the characters in this movie are \\"types.\\"  Two dimensional.  Woodstock was a \\"happening\\" that actually \\"happened\\" to people in a whirlwind and unique way.  This could have and should have been captured with the humanity of at least a few characters fleshed out.  Instead this film shows the main character as more of a fluttering piece of paper that contorts in the wind but in the end lies flat as before.  Desperate reality (like negotiations with the banker over the motel mortgage) are still forced into a comic strip mentality, the troupe living in the barn has no sense of the grubbiness of their situation or the searching quality of youth, and on-and-on it goes.  For the touchstone event of a generation, this film is a dramatic failure in the one area it should hit center mass: emotional depth.  Instead this is a robot's version of what humans do and feel.
B002QGSW8I|4.0|Across time and history this tale of the Doomsday Key will take you. One of the best summer reads so far.. I've read Balducci, Silva,Flynn, Brown, Larson...add Rollins to you authors list. Great read, keep me turning pages and was a nice escape. Subject matter was different than the reads above, 'cept for Brown. There are 3 storylines going on that keep the reader engaged, it's one of those books you can't put down for a week and remember all the players and what's happening with them. This is a book that when you start reading plan on reading it through, it's worth it. Enjoyed.

B002BJGYU8|4.0|This is really just a review about Gilmore Girls Season 2, because the product is just a bunch of DVDs displaying some of the best moments of the series. But, uh, they're great DVDs too, no doubt. But seriously, Season 2? It's filled with all of those amazing Rory/ Jess moments, and with the exception of a few episodes in the beginning of Season 3, these are really the only happy moments we get. So get this season and enjoy while it lasts, because the farther along we go the more Dean comes back... The only downside to these DVDs that makes me give it 4/5 stars is the fact that the bonus material is not so great. It includes maybe 2 unaired scenes, one fact-pop-up episode, a short segment on how other countries received Gilmore Girls, and a short collage of the seasons best shouting matches. Personally, I'm more of an \\"interview with the cast\\" or \\"backstage\\" kind of girl, but if these bonus materials excite you, hit purchase because this is a great price for a great season!

0061928356|3.0|First thoughts after finishing this book: \\" Wow, I loved that ending!!!\\"<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of fiction that takes place in India and so when offered the chance to read this story I didn't hesitate to say yes. I'm not sure what happened that made me feel so disconnected to all of the characters in this book but I found myself becoming easily distracted and just not really caring how the story turned out. In fact, I pretty much thought I knew exactly how it would turn out. The writing is wonderful and the author certainly made me feel as if I was in India. I felt such pain for the Indian mothers that had to abort, kill, or give their daughters up for adoption. I'm always amazed at the cruelty towards women that basically seems to permeate throughout the world. But, there was still that problem for me of connecting with a character. It may have been the going back and forth between five different characters...and just feeling like I'm getting into that person's story and then I turn the page and I'm reading about a different person! But I continued on with the story because I was curious as to how it all turned out. And boy am I glad that I did. I thought the last couple of chapters were fantastic and the ending totally changed my reading enjoyment and lifted my rating a full point!<br /><br />Recommend? Even though I found myself having a hard time finding a connection, I would recommend this to friends because I think the story itself is an important read. I also think the author writes beautifully...and I loved experiencing India through her characters eyes. I would not hesitate to read another book by Shilpi. I honestly feel that the failure to connect to a character is all my fault...sometimes you pick up the right book but just at the wrong time.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10
B000QCS8TW|5.0|In case it isn't obvious I read this on the Kindle. I don't remember any typos or mistakes in formatting as has been seen in some certain other Kindle editions. I will say the map may as well have not been included because it is simply impossible, at least on my particular model, to read anything on the map. I can bring it up on other devices in the Kindle reader (like a laptop) so I'm not really complaining.<br /><br />I'm not one of your avid readers who reads everything that comes out and finishes 1,000 page novels in a weekend. I have read a few fantasy books in the past couple years and they always seemed to be inspired by DnD on some level.<br /><br />I heard about this series and how adult and unpredictable it was. And the HBO adaption got me that much more excited about it.<br /><br />Well one thing that makes me want to give this a high rating is that it is decidedly NOT of the LotRs/DnD school of fantasy. It's much more of a political intrigue and situation manipulation sort of a thing. This isn't for your 7th - 12th grade audience in other words, it's more for college and older.<br /><br />Not everything is spelled out for you, some things are insinuated and you have to decide for yourself who is working towards what agenda.<br /><br />I won't try to summarize the plot but I will say I think I enjoy Jon Snow and Tyrion possibly the best. And indeed main characters do die, sometimes this is predictable sometimes not. I haven't really figured out why the story is told from the perspective of some characters and not from others.<br /><br />The only complaints I have about are the incredible number of different characters introduced. There's all these houses with different insignias who have married other houses and produced uncles and nephews and some relatives are more in line with that house than with this other one and...it's just hard to keep track of. Maybe that's more on me than the story to make sure all that stuff is tracked. In fact I may have to read this book a second time.<br /><br />The other complaint is the ending or perhaps the lack of an ending. None of the story lines really concludes, you just kind of finish a chapter and find yourself at the appendix.  I do want to read the next book though (I already bought it).<br /><br />As has been warned before this is not a book for the kids. There's blood, guts, sex, rape, decapitations...not a bed time story. And pregnant woman who may be emotional already may want to avoid it.<br /><br />I'm not sure there is really a \\"good guy\\" in this book. It's just kind of a set of families fighting with another set of families. Everyone is kind of a \\"shade of grey\\" in other words. No one's all the way in the right or all the way on the bad guy side.<br /><br />I did thoroughly enjoy the book and if you can past all the adult content mentioned above I highly recommend it.aint is the ending or perhaps the lack of an ending.

B004GP3DTK|5.0|I am kicking myself for not knowing who Mr. Big was before buying the Tak Matsumoto Group album and wondering who the singer was.  I thought he was a young kid but no, he's a year older than me and been around for the eighties and nineties rock roller coaster.  I couldn't afford the one \\"Actual Size\\" that isn't on MP3 list but I now own all the other studio albums.  I am enjoying the great vocals and fun rock songs.  Eric Martin is now my favorite rock and roll singer!  He just has a great range and power that just electrifies the songs.  I hope that \\"What If...\\" is not the last album for this awesome band!

0670022411|1.0|I really wanted to love this book. Witches, vampires, alchemy, history, rare books, wine..all things I love. So why then am I struggling to even complete another chapter? Because it's boooorrrring. Read other reviews and you will understand. NOTHING HAPPENS. Not only is there NO action, there is no sex, no violence, nothing. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!<br /><br />Yeah shes a witch, but one who has never used her powers because they frighten her? okaaay. So, her powers seep out, causing a rare book, which everyone wants to get ahold of, reveal itself to her. What does she do? Puts it back. yep, a book is extremely rare, everyone wants it and it wants YOU, and you..put it back. sigh.<br /><br /> She meets a hot vampire. GREAT. Has this author ever seen TRUE BLOOD? Todays readers want hot vampire sex. NOPE, have you heard of \\"bundling\\"? You just lay there all wrapped up in blankets so you cant touch each other, talking and getting to know one another in bed. She describes how hot and sexually magnetic he is and endlessly kissing him, and then...nothing. YAWN again. I'm not saying there has to be gore and porn for me to enjoy a book, but come on! Its like this was written by a repressed woman who frowns upon \\"adult\\" content. It's 2011 lady, not 1811!!!<br /><br />We have to listen to her describe in minute detail her voratious appetite for food, her endless cups of herbal tea (and I mean hundreds of cups by page 300) her sleeping habits (she sleeps more than a narcoleptic) and her exercising (yoga, rowing...are you kidding me?)<br /><br />This is all one big, long boring waste of my time. What is aggrivating is that this is supposed to be a trilogy? Im in the middle of the book, and there are 579 pages of her doing nothing. WHY would I continue to read this, nevertheless go out and purchase book 2 or 3?

0618918248|4.0|Quite a lively debate has arisen in recent years between atheists (finding their voice at last) and believers.  Of course, there is a broad spectrum of belief - ranging from, \\"I do not need faith; I know for certain there is a God\\" to, \\"I suppose there is no God, but we must try to believe there is, else what becomes of morality and social cohesion?\\" - and unbelief, ranging from \\"No one can know, either way\\" to, \\"I know for certain there is no God\\".  The nature of a particular debate - the issues raised and arguments used - depend on what points in those spectra the protagonists occupy.<br /><br />Dawkins uses a slightly different scale, from 1 (certain knowledge of God's existence) to 7 (certain knowledge of God's non-existence).  He says he occupies stage 6 (God's existence is so improbable, we should assume he does not exist).  This book attempts to justify that position and challenge the others.  In fact, he is more concerned with encouraging fellow skeptics to 'come out' (he likens it to the gay liberation movement) than with converting believers, which he recognizes as near-impossible.<br /><br />A problem I have always had with Dawkins is his irrational belief in memetics.  I am fairly certain that God has no objective reality, but I am totally convinced that memes don't.  He discusses memes in this book but, thankfully, does not insist on that approach.  Similarly, he touches on his equally problematic contention that natural selection occurs at, and only at the level of the gene (a position he has wavered on from book to book and within books) but does not make it central to his arguments in any way.  So you can, like me, be deeply skeptical of memetics and the selfish gene model, but not have that affect your judgment of the ideas in this book.<br /><br />The scope of the book is broad, far beyond a mere challenge to the rationality of theistic belief.  It is concerned also with the origin of morality, and the evil effects of religion, among other things.<br /><br />I found some of his arguments more convincing than others.  Debunking the traditional arguments for the existence of God (that is, the arguments based on reason, such as the ontological argument) is fairly straightforward -- there is nothing new here, and Dawkins does not spend too much time on it.  But he is less good when it comes to religious experience, that is, transcendent or mystical experience, which does not rely on reason.  He certainly appreciates, and shares, the sense of wonder one feels in the presence of Nature, but he seems unaware of the profound intensity such a sense can achieve, and the kind of narrative (normally termed `religious') that such intense experiences demand.  And his perfunctory dismissal of Jung shows how badly he underestimates the unconscious and irrational underpinnings of human personality.<br /><br />Similarly, he professes a stronger faith in science than I am comfortable with.  As a skeptic, I would consider myself lax if I were not skeptical about science, whereas Dawkins seems to have a naïve faith in its power.  Questions such as the origin of the Universe will almost certainly be forever beyond human science and must remain a mystery, coming to terms with which must be part of the human adventure.  Dawkins would have no truck with such a view -- science, he is sure, will get there one day.<br /><br />As is usual in his writings, he anticipates and answers criticism, often in a bare-knuckle style.  This 2008 paperback edition (which is the one you should get) has a Preface and some notes that are additional to the 2006 hardback and which advance the discussion.  Also as usual, he makes frequent reference to Web resources and provides links to them.  The disadvantage of this is that many references quickly become unavailable, but the advantage is their increased topicality.  These references can lead you into a variety of discussion threads, if you are so inclined.<br /><br />This is such an important debate andthis book is such an erudite and wide-ranging, well-written contribution to the debate, that you really should read it.  But read it critically (which is easy) and with an open mind (which is not).<br />[PeterReeve]tten contribution to the debate, that you really should read it.

B000UJ48XG|1.0|obviously I'm way in the minority on this guy, but my roommates used to play his stuff endlessly, and I thought it was empty sentimental garbage, and the vocals are so one-note with that grating harmonic interval that just never ever shifts. This is some of the most soulless crap I have ever heard, fake emotion, contrived and affected so far it seems it's just going to burst inward on its emptiness. Unbearable. So glad I don't live with those no-taste fools anymore.
0316098329|2.0|Who writes these reviews??  The book has only been out for 12 weeks and already 1,000 people love it?  Not so fast...............allow a dissenting opinion.    This is the second book published this summer by a female author channeling the voice of a male child.  \\"The Kid\\" by Sapphire so far out-paces \\"Room\\" that it is no contest. One (\\"The Kid\\") is gritty, real, shocking, and stays w/ you long after the final page.  The other (\\"Room\\") is cutesy, a bit \\"icky\\", and has you imagining the Lifetime TV movie version. Oh, I just got it!!  That's what readers these days like.    And, please, UK-born authors (this means you, Emma Donoghue & Monica Ali), get an editor for your American dialogue.  It is uber annoying to hear American citizens using UKisms:  in the case of Donoghue, \\"bit\\" every other paragraph.
B00514HDNW|4.0|You've seen the movie. Will Smith chin uping his way through the end of the world.<br /><br />The movie was a picnic in the park compared to the book. In reality the movie should have given itself a whole other title. I give four stars on this only because I believe Matheson hurt his book with all of references that date the story. Otherwise this is a classic that every reader should read if they enjoy horror/suspense.<br /><br />The psychological drama involved will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending will finally explain why the book is called 'I AM LEGEND' unlike whatever was going on with the movie.<br /><br />I really cannot say more than if you have an interest at all, read it, you won't be disappointed.

B0007D9VAK|5.0|My 12 year old grandson is interested in computer games development and animation design so I had asked ICT grads with an interest in this area which book or magazine etc would be a good start or ongoing instruction. The Animator's Survival Kit was recommended and when it arrived I realised it was very comprehensive and although more suitable for an older person this is something he can work on and keep forever. It is fun, easy to understand and shows how much work and practice is needed to become really good at animation. This is the bible and like the Bible, not everyone will read it from front to back, they may keep coming back to the bits that interest them until they eventually have a good knowledge of the subject. Well presesnted and fun and usefull - unlike the other bible.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|After doing my research into fan cooling solutions, this one stood out as the best price/performance balance available.  I ordered one and installed it to replace the stock fan cooler on my new 955BE build.  Installation was easy (much simpler than liquid cooling installs) and did a 'dry' run to ensure everything fit.  This allowed me to observe memory module clearance, side panel fitment, and overall airflow pattern.  Ensure the proper slot is selected for the type of CPU on the retainer.  I strongly suggest removing the attached 120mm fan prior to install as that will allow you more room to work - even on a new build install.<br /><br />This cooling solution keeps my CPU temp at 28C at idle and I have not observed it higher than 34C under a heavy gaming load.  I added a second 120mm fan on the exhaust side and dropped my temps by another degree celsius.<br /><br />With the results of this first application, I ordered two more of these for FM1 socket cooling.  I'm not sure what the engineers at AMD were thinking when they paired the tiny heat-sink (plate surface does not cover the CPU die)and loud fan for their new flagship, but it fails at cooling that CPU.  With the manufacturer's cooler, temps were at 59-61C at idle and 64C under minimal load.  After installing this aftermarket cooler, idle temp is 30C and under load is 33C.  On my second FM1 build, same results (I even installed the factory cooler just to see if the first build was an anomaly - it wasn't - exact same high temps) and I couldn't be happier with the results of this cooling solution.  With these low temps, I did not bother adding a second 120mm exhaust fan for both the FM1 builds.

140574913X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moDQNOFSFA0TAJ]]HERE'S A WEALTH OF ADVICE, COMMENT AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS COMPLEX AND CONTROVERSIAL AREA OF LAW<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />We were rather taken by Gavin Drewry's remark, as part of his contributory chapter included in this enlightening book, that `judicial review of administrative action has apparently been something of a growth industry.' How right after 40 years when Stanley de Smith described it as inevitably \\"sporadic and peripheral\\" by its nature (then).<br /><br />There can be little doubt that Drewry's view is true today --  and a good thing too -- as judicial review in all its complexities has provided, and continues to provide, a legal remedy aimed at righting administrative wrongs.<br /><br />Growth indicates change, of course - and, yes, the area of judicial review continues to evolve, generating new developments of which the alert practitioner needs to be aware in order to construct an effective response.  The astonishingly lengthy Table of Cases -- over 100 pages -- bears this out.<br /><br />Drewry is one of a very long roster of expert and illustrious contributors to this new fourth edition of Judicial Review, now under the able editorship of Helen Fenwick. As this is a contributor-led book, it offers practitioners access to a variety of informed views and opinions, which is always very useful if you are an advocate searching for a solution.<br /><br />As Fenwick explains, the book is concerned with `the impact of new developments once they have more fully taken effect, rather than with their innovation'.  It deals with, for example, a range of important developments under the Human Rights Act 1988 which affect judicial review, as examined in the new chapter on proportionality.<br /><br />The book examines and clarifies a wide range of other areas, from the nature of judicial review and its historical background to  procedural rules,  natural justice, bias, devolution and of course much, much more.  Indeed, all recent developments in judicial review have been covered, in accordance with the editor's overall modern aim to suit us as the users.<br /><br />Research resources abound, including, in addition to the extensive Table of Cases, (alphabetized, thank goodness) there are tables of statutes, statutory instruments, codes of practice, European and international legislation and a further table of foreign legislation.<br /><br />So if you're a practitioner, or in any way connected professionally or even generally with judicial review, it's vital in our view to add this book to your judicial review library.<br /><br />We would add here, however, that the current controversial problems of mounting judicial review remain even though they have been admirably well explained in the four successive editions of this book dating from the time that Supperstone J was the first editor.<br /><br />The book provides a most useful statement, but, because of the sheer expense, popularity and complexity of judicial review today, we expect another review of its mechanisms, with a view to giving it a comprehensive overhaul to suit current access to justice policy as the last modern changes were undertaken 30 years ago and much has changed from de Smith's earlier historic description from the 1970s.uch more.

1402238843|4.0|This is my first ever Heyer book! I had not heard about her before I started book blogging but when I did she was everywhere and I was intrigued by this old icon. If you are reading historical romance then you should read her too, and now I finally have. I liked what I read, a lot. I can't say I noticed that it was originally published in the 50s either.<br /><br />To the story. Venetia has lived all her life at Harrorgate and has not travelled at all. Her father wanted her at home and therefore she has not known many men either. Though she has two suitors, but they are soon forgotten when she meets the rake next door. Poor Venetia, she had such a  thirst for life but her dad was an idiot when he was alive. Still she is just so sweet that she does not mind because she loves her home and her brother. The thing with Venetia is that she might just be too sweet. I usually do not like heroines this sweet but here it works because, well she is just so nice. She is very forgiving. But she does have a tongue on her too and can put down her suitors when they get too odious. I think that is why it works, because she has a mind of her own and I like her witty style.<br /><br />The style is very amusing and the banter between Demarel and Venetia is sweet, and it just made me think Jane Austen (and we all know I love her.) These two just hits it off at once, they are playful, they flirt, and it all so very cute. I know he is a rake, but not with her, though he does say a few things now and then, but so does she. For once I can be shocked for silly reasons. In the end I truly love sweet romances where people at most kiss and that is utterly scandalous of course.<br /><br />It is not all a dance on roses. He is a rake, so no one wants him close to them. She does have two very silly suitors. Something happens that will cause a uproar. But this is a lovestory and she knows what she wants.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I am happy to have read my first Heyer book and I will read more. I do recommend this one to romance lovers. The style is humorous and I love the old talk.vers. The style is humorous and I love the old talk.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|First, I'm an old Photoshop user with over 18 years of experience.  For me accurate colors are not an option, I NEED accurate colors.<br /><br />Second, I'm used to calibrating my displays by hand.  I have set of calibration images I have used effectively across the years.  Manual calibration has become difficult as the number of displays I use in a day has increased.  One thing is to get decent colors and another to have multiple displays have the SAME colors.<br /><br />Third, I have the Pantone Huey Pro and I was never totally happy with the results.  I could always see some kind of color cast on the result so I ended having to tweak the resulting color profile by hand.<br /><br />I got the ColorMunki because it seemed like an upgrade from the legendary X-Rite i1Display.  I did find some reviews for the ColorMunki but they all used the more expensive model, the Xrite i1Display Pro for their reviews.  Still, after careful study I determined that the added features of the i1Display Pro model were not relevant to my needs.  The ColorMunki had all the features and parameters I was looking for.<br /><br />The included software was easy to use.  There was an update on the X-Rite site for the software but it looked like a small update.<br /><br />I went through the menus, follow instructions.  Calibration took like 5 minutes.  It measures ambient light and has the option to compensate for changing lighting conditions.  This is an option I don't care much for but is there is you want it.  You need to leave the ColorMunki connected to your computer for this.<br /><br />During calibration the ColorMunki actually took control of my monitor settings.  Changing contrast, brightness, color balance and then adding a color profile to Windows.  I was VERY impressed and the results were better than anything I have ever seen.<br /><br />It even did a GREAT job with my two laptops.  In those cases I had to manually increase or decrease the screen brightness but again a painless process.<br /><br />In total I calibrated 5 computers and all look very close in brightness and colors.  I never would have been able to do this with hand calibration.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with the results from the ColorMunki.  I can now move from computer to computer without having to worry about the colors been incorrect.  My laptops (like most laptops these days) use TN displays that shift the colors as you change viewing angles (reason graphic artist are hesitant to use laptops for graphic work) but it was still a huge improvement from the default settings.  Just getting the brightness of the laptops correct was a big win.<br /><br />I recommend this product for any photographer and graphic artist that care about color accuracy.<br /><br />-------UPDATE-------<br /><br />First, there has been an update from X-Rite to the X-Rite XRD Manager.  It seems to solve several problems with the program not responding.  This component (the XRD Manager) gets installed by the X-Rite drivers but this component got a separate update.<br /><br />Go to the X-Rite site and search for \\"X-Rite Device Services (XRD)\\", the latest version as of today is 2.2.  Below are a list of issues (rare issues) I have encountered with ColorMunki but I don't know if this update would solve any, some or all of them.  Will update in the future after this update.<br /><br />I wanted to update my review with several issues I have encountered while calibrating some displays.  Note, all my testing is with Windows 7 64bit and Vista 32bit computers, I don't know how the ColorMunkey would work on a Mac or older versions of Windows.<br /><br />Problem 1:  For some displays I've had to calibrate twice to get the right colors.  Not common but it has happened to me.  If the colors don't look right try again. I suspect this to be a Windows issue (I suspect the latest patch will fix this).<br /><br />Problem 2: It works better when Windows has drivers for the monitor.  Yes, for most monitors in Windows7 and Vista Microsoft will send you drivers for your monitor through the Windows update feature (optional updates).  ColorMunkey seems to use the information on the drivers to some extent.<br /><br />Problem 3: I have found SOME monitors that REFUSE to calibrate NO MATTER what.  ColorMunkei depends on being able to take control of the monitor settings.  I found that one of my old Samsung 21\\" monitor (DVI Connection) would not calibrate no matter what.  Then again this monitor has poor colors even if you manually calibrate it.<br /><br />Problem 4:  This is perhaps the biggest problem for many, ColorMunkei doesn't do miracles.  A bad display is, well ...  a bad display.  To get acceptable results ColorMunkei needs all primary colors and most of the secondary colors to display within an acceptable range (usually no more than 3 deltas of difference from ideal color).  Some displays will not give you good colors no matter how you calibrate.  In those cases calibration becomes more of an art than a science and ColorMunkei is no good at that.  Manual calibration is your only hope here as only you can know what color defects are acceptable to you.<br /><br />Example:  A particular monitor can't display blues right, after calibration all other colors look good but now you have a blue color cast because calibrating the other colors actually highlights the blue color issue even more.<br /><br /> I still would recommend Color Munkey without hesitation but problem number 3 is specially disturbing.  This tells me that at least on Windows machines we can get some kind of hardware/software incompatibility that you can't overcome (I have not tested with the latest patch from X-Rite yet).  Problem number 4 is more about expectations, know your hardware and understand what it can do.  TN panels are cheap and color quality varies a LOT on them.  You CAN make them look better after calibration but IPS are generally better if color is critical to you.  It is better to begin with a good display and then calibrate to get the most from it.  Don't get a bad display and expect calibration to fix every color issue.7 and Vista Microsoft will send you drivers for your monitor through the Windows update feature (optional updates).

1594484805|5.0|I loved Pink's previous book `a whole new Mind' and have been intending to read this for the past few years. If anything, this is better and it is a fitting follow up. I must say that I like his style. It could be because he is an economist and is much tighter and less `fuzzy' than most psychologists.<br /><br />His premise is that there is a shift in business practice which must be accompanied with a shift in the way in which we understand motivation. He cleverly gives us a Twitter summary `Carrots and sticks are so last century. Drive says for 21st century work, we need to upgrade to autonomy, mastery and purpose.'<br /><br />He introduces the idea of three drives. The third drive concept is a `no brainer' and we are in the era of the third drive. If you want to engage people's cerebral cortex's (especially the decision making, independent frontal lobe) leaders must understand the third drive and how to enable it; this book shows you how to do that.<br /><br />In most businesses today we need people to think for themselves and be creative; research shows that sticks and carrots do not motivate this type of work. In fact there is evidence to show that extrinsic motivators actually demotivate people long term. If we fail to understand the significance of this, we could be developing an entire generation of demotivated people who will either leave or just stay for the money and be switched off. Lack of engagement is a worry when you want self (intrinsically) motivated and creative employees.<br /><br />Why has it taken so long for organisations to realise this? Pink warns, there is a gap between what science knows and business does. We are still trying to fit new work into a set of rules that we knew worked well in the days of manual, boring, linear tasks where thinking could be a disadvantage. He highlights a few successful businesses are already taking brave steps to break the existing and powerful paradigm of management beliefs. A whole new generation of business builders are creating companies their own way without the `wiring' of the past.<br /><br />He then, clearly, describes three eras of work and accompanying motivation (drives). His work is based on (and credits) many others including Mihalyi Csiksenthmihalyi, Edward Deci, and McGreggor. His type I (intrinsic) and X (extrinsic) are a tribute to McGregor's type X and Y managers. This research has been around for years - it just hasn't been needed at work until recent times.<br /><br />Interestingly for someone like me with an interest in neuro research, his three drives relate to the three areas of the brain in humans; brain stem, Limbic and cerebral cortex. It seems hardly surprising that the first drive (brain stem) should have been mainly about survival... `do this or I will kill you' fairly basic but effective in it's time. The second drive presented itself most strongly during the Industrial Revolution (as did many of our present management practices and archetypes). This drive relates most closely to the limbic system by engaging the threat / reward centre of the brain. This became widely known as the `stick and carrot' approach. `Don't do that or I will punish you' and `do this and I will reward you'.<br /><br />Like it or not, we have transitioned into a world where cerebral thinking, judgement and awareness is the secret to success. Unfortunately, many organisations still base their management on the second drive to the extent of even framing their reward systems around the reward / punish approach even though they now want people to contribute their cerebral thinking and awareness. They are `stuck' in their mental wiring and fail to see alternative options. Unfortunately, there is evidence to show that this will demotivate the best thinkers long term.<br /><br />Pink is quick to point out that there are still some circumstances where basic `algorithmic' work can benefit from this second motivation. However, in most businesses we need people to think for themselves and be creative. He produces a useful flowchart for deciding on second or third motivational needs. In some circumstances, where a basic, boring job must be done, he offers alternative ways to maintain some short term motivation.<br />He addresses the dangers of corporate reward systems and suggests a number of better options. He advises a results focus, an after the event reward and a warning to avoid the human tendency to `wrought' the system by making systems more complex.<br /><br />Drive is an easy to read book with research, examples and exercises to practice. He supplies a good book list and collection of Gurus whose approaches support the third drive.<br /><br />The third drive is a `no brainer'. If you want to engage people's cerebral cortex's (especially the decision making, independent frontal lobe) leaders must understand the third drive and how to enable it.  We all need to understand our natural intrinsic motivation whether at home or at work. This book shows you how to do that through three key areas: autonomy, mastery and purpose.

159514188X|5.0|When I first heard of this book, I knew it would be intense. Anytime I had to set the book down, I couldn't wait to pick it up again. I wanted to understand, as the title suggests, why. Why did Hannah kill herself? Why does anyone want to kill themselves?<br /><br />The story surrounds clay Jensen as he listens to 7 cassette tapes. What's on the tapes? Hannah Baker's story of the 13 reasons why she killed herself just 2 weeks before. Thirteen reasons... thirteen people. Hannah has them sent to all of them, in order, else the things said on the tapes be made public. Considering the things that happened to her, all would comply.<br /><br />As you read Hannah's words, your heart aches. The actions (and sometimes ignorance, which in itself is an action) of people are seemingly harmless, at least to them they are. It's okay to spread rumors (it's just words), it's okay to feel somebody up (it's all in good fun), it's high school, it's expected. Is it? Is it really? I won't deny that it happens, and I won't say that some can't handle the pressures and walk away with few scars and move on with their life. Because some can. For Hannah, it was the culmination of every moment, one on top of the other. Snowballing. Nobody knew what was happening to her on the inside. Sadly, most don't notice when someone is heading down that road...<br /><br />Suicide.<br /><br />Some people make it obvious--isolation and depression. Others pretend everything's fine, go through the motions, they've learned to tell people what they want to hear. There are subtle signs too, and often we have to remind ourselves to trust our instincts. If something is out of place in a room, we notice. When somebody is contemplating whether or not to take their life, they drop hints... \\"The signs were all there, all over, for anyone willing to notice.\\" ... but nobody stopped her.<br /><br />This book strikes a chord with me, since I know people who are bipolar or have major depression. I've never wanted to kill myself, but after reading what goes through the mind of somebody who wants to, I can empathize. One spot in the book summarizes the feeling well: \\"If you hear a song that a makes you cry and you don't want to cry anymore, you don't listen to that song anymore. But you can`t get away from yourself. You can`t decide not to see yourself anymore. You can`t decide to turn off the noise in your head.\\" You can't escape you.<br /><br />You may think, Why read this if it's just going to upset me? We already know she's dead and nothing can change that. True. But this book can change YOU. This book can help YOU. You may not realize it yet, but after you finish it, you have hope. For you, for a loved one, a friend, a family member.<br /><br />As a side note here--to anyone who is contemplating suicide or knows someone who is, please ask for help. You are an important person who is loved. Don't give up.gh the mind of somebody who wants to, I can empathize. One spot in the book summarizes the feeling well: \\"If you hear a song that a makes you cry and you don't want to cry anymore, you don't listen to that song anymore. But you can`t get away from yourself. You can`t decide not to see yourself anymore. You can`t decide to turn off the noise in your head.\\" You can't escape you.    You may think, Why read this if it's just going to upset me? We already know she's dead and nothing can change that. True. But this book can change YOU. This book can help YOU. You may not realize it yet, but after you finish it, you have hope. For you, for a loved one, a friend, a family member.    As a side note here--to anyone who is contemplating suicide or knows someone who is, please ask for help. You are an important person who is loved. Don't give up.
0345505387|1.0|this has to be, by far the worst published art work ive seen in quite a while.  all the characters looked too similar and the depiction of claire very insulting to the diana g. character.  ive read all of the  outlander books ( 7 ) and the lord john series, how could this have been approved by any publisher?  this poor person needs a good nightschool drawing class in human anatomy...!!
0786956127|5.0|I like these tiles for many reasons.  First they are thick and substantial.  They are also double sided.  Primarily one side is just a woodland scene with maybe a tree or two on it, and the other has more specific details like a camp, fire, lakes, rivers, wagons, chests, etc...<br /><br />There are a lot of tiles in the set, of many different sizes.  Plenty of large ones and smaller ones that you can use to custom make your landscapes.  I cannot speak to whether or not these are different from other sets as I don't have any of the old ones, but if you don't own any wilderness tiles, these are worth the money.<br /><br />The box is also nice as it contains the grid pattern on it and can be used to simulate a hill, rise or earthen fort.<br /><br />All in all, I have been very pleased with this set, and plan to purchase other master sets as well.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|When I read the d be for the book I thought it would be medium average, and slow. But I was wrong.     THis is one of the best books I've ever read, It starts out and you're captivated, with so many questions. I started with a sample not wanting to waste my money. I don't regret buying for a minute.    I spent half of my day, ignoring everyone and everything chewing through this book. Abby and Travis's terribly toxic but amazing relationship keeps you reading, even once it's done you'll be rereading.    I give Jamie Mcguire's book 5 stars, easily. I am yet to find a fault.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|First time I saw this book was in a recommendation in my kindle, and I couldn't really see the cover and I'm so glad I bought it and began reading it before I took a closer look at the cover.  Okay so the cover was a disaster but the book within was beautiful!  I would say without a doubt this was the most entertaining fictional book I have read in a long time, every page sucked me in and Jamie McGuire's writing was so well done I felt as if I were watching a movie.  I normally won't reread books but I think for this one I'll make an exception.
0307454541|2.0|Read this book rather quickly, and perhaps I am missing something but it wasn't enjoyable on many levels. The writing is to the point, something I find agreeable. However, the characters and their motivations didn't bring me into the novel as much as I expected. That said, the plot is interesting (the author has a great ability to paint the technical aspects of the world very well, and this, on a level, compensates for the lack of character depth) and I wanted to find out about the flowers. Once I found out, I was extremely displeased. I can see how people like this book, but it was not for me.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski? Is it being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the cost? Isn't that that makes a man? The Big Lebowski is a film written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski who is referred to as \\"The Dude\\". This is arguably the most clever movie ever made. This is a fact that is strongly supported by a legion of hardcore dedicated fans world wide. The Big Lebowski is not a cult film - it is the cult film. It has a zen like leisure to it scarcely ever found before or after it came out. You don't have to be a real slacker you can just watch one on television. Aside from all the amazing sensationalism there is a also a great film here as well. The film is loosely based on Raymond Chandler's novel, The Big Sleep. To understand this film I highly recommend you make a couple dozen strong White Russians, sit back, and enjoy. The Dude abides.

0143039830|3.0|I read this book and came away from it with mixed feelings. I might read it again to see if I can find anything, but as of an initial reading I did not connect with much of what was said. I appreciated the last story more than the first two. The first two wandered too much for my tastes. They were different, but I couldn't gather much else from it (though the descriptions of nyc as well as its history was compelling). The author has a good way of writing that is simple and to the point, however the plot lines of the first two did not gain my interest (it is only that the writing itself is good that I would consider reading this again). The last story seemed to have much more contemplation as well as depth to the protagonist, therefore it stuck to my mind in a more significant way (and it is the story that receives most of my praise). Read the last story; it was engaging and original.
0891419063|5.0|The criteria for a \\"Five Star Rating\\" in Amazon review is, \\"I Love it.\\"  Although I rate \\"With the Old Breed\\" a five star book, \\"I loved it,\\"it is hardly the appropriate comment. A more appropriate comment would be,\\"a must read.\\" I will have nightmares for months over the events Sledge describes, I am stil glad I read it and consider it to the best critique of the atrocities of war (as experienced by the actual combatants) since the novel,\\"All Quiet on the Western Front.\\"  Pvt. Sledge's accounts, however, are not fiction...he describes how he miraculously lived through te Peleliu and Okinawa invasions...his brilliant and graphic descriptions allow me to feel that I was there with him and also experienced the brutality of these battles.  That, as he would agree, is impossible, as no one could appreciate the plight of the Marine infantry man \\"grunt\\" who has not experienced combat.<br /><br />As a former Marine (non-combatant during Viet Nam), I realize,(or at least think that I realize) the huge difference between my role (teletype operator) and the roles of the \\"real Marines\\" who fought the war.  I intend to give a copy of the book to a \\"real Marine\\" friend of mine who is still trying to cope with his Viet Nam experience 35 yrs ago.<br /><br />I am proud to be a Marine and have the honor of sharing its honors with the real Marines who made the Corps what it is.<br /><br />The only negatives that I have concerning \\"With the Old Breed\\" are the vagueness of the map illustrations and, more importantly, the illogical conclusion by Pvt Sledge in the final pages where he seems to right all the wrongs about the War in the Pacific with mushy patriotism without mentioning that this theatre of WWII was caused by the clash of economic interests (read \\"corporate greed\\"), a not particularly moral issue.  This is not (at least in my opinion) a noble enough cause to warrant the extreme sacrifices Pvt Slege and his fellow Marines made.

B002ONC9NC|5.0|**Spoiler alert**...though the plot really isn't a secret.    The basic plot of An Education is slight, but superb acting and directing lift the story of a schoolgirl's affair into a study of regret, fear and yearning--it's often very funny, sure, but still a little heartbreaking despite the essentially `happy ending.'    Carey Mulligan was rightly praised for her portrayal of Jenny, but I have to say that Peter Sarsgaard is incredible. He's no creepy conman who just wants to seduce a young girl. He wants to actually be her, to take all that freshness and curiosity into himself, to have all that possibility laid out before him. At heart he's all too aware of how badly his life has gone wrong. His business (working for notorious slumlord Peter Rachman) is tawdry, and his marriage and home are shabby. He's deceiving himself as well as Jenny when he spins his dreams and explanations; and he loves to see himself through her eyes--as a worldly, exciting man. Of course he's happy to wait for her to be ready to lose her virginity, of course he's peculiar in bed: sex was never the point. And tie-clipped David can't in reality compete with his more sophisticated and wealthier friend Danny, so he's terrified into rash action when he sees him flirting with Jenny.     Jenny and her mother both know that there's something a little bit wrong with David. Jenny has doubts about David from the moment he makes an asinine, flattering remark to her mother, but puts them aside. If I have one complaint about the movie it's this: to me it's implausible that Jenny would have ditched her A levels, even though I know it's a memoir and she DID ditch her A levels. As played by Mulligan, Jenny is smarter and more perceptive than that. She's someone who'd see no reason to make a choice between university and marriage.    The supporting cast is fabulous. Jenny's bombastic lower middle-class father yearns for his daughter to be clever and confident, able to mix with the `right' people. Caught wrong-footed by the more urbane David, whom he sees as his social superior, he's easily played. \\"All my life I've been scared,\\" he admits to Jenny in the end, \\"I didn't want you to be scared.\\"    Jenny's mother is wistful for the days when she knew how to get to St John's, Smith Square; her face and body language are pitch-perfect as she waits up for her daughter after that first date. She's a mother who remembers how it was--and wishes it could still be so. She's both terrified for her daughter and wishes that she was her.  She knows David isn't quite right, but she's still charmed by him. And she appears to be a heck of a lot brighter than her husband, but like all the women in this film, has had limited opportunities.    Jenny's naïve but she's no victim. I see that some viewers don't find the story credible. From a modern perspective, especially an American perspective, perhaps it's not. But having grown up in pretty similar circumstances not too many years after Jenny, I found it to almost eerily reflect the times, the persuasions of class, and the desires of a young girl living in them.  And having had a very similar conversation with a very similar headmistress, I can assure you that Emma Thompson's character is spot-on.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Not one man in this movie, but who cares. This is a terrific movie made in 1939, which is typically considered the year that generated more great films than any other. Adapted from the play by Clare Booth Luce, it tells the story of the happily married Mary Haines (played by Norma Shearer) who discovers that her husband Stephen is philandering with a tart  shopgirl named Crystal (played by Joan Crawford) in the cruelest of ways. When it comes to a showdown with Stephen, Crystal wins out and off Mary goes to Reno to get a divorce. In Reno, Mary encounters a wide range of would-be divorcees at the dude ranch where she is residing for six weeks. Hilarity reigns supreme as the diverse women interact with one another while telling their tales. The actresses range from hottie showgirl Paulette Goddard to dowager rich woman Mary Boland to Mary's disconnected friend Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Rusell). At the ranch the comedy ranges from ribald to physical and the comedic timing is perfection. Back to NYC and reality, Mary carries a torch for Stephen who is remarried (and miserable) to Crystal who is diddling on the side with a yodling cowboy named Buck Winston. All this culminates with a public cat fight which adds to the general mayhem.<br />This is absolutely one of my favorite comedies from any year. The large cast of women perform well in tandem with one another. Their characters are well-defined and the dialogue is snappy and oh-so-funny. The script doesn't drag or drone on endlessly. While the staging was done in 1939 style, it is barely noticable once you get into the story. The female ensemble cast plays off one another beautifully and while the meatiest parts are played by Shearer and Crawford, all the actresses manage to shine brightly and own their roles.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I installed the original SwiftKey 6 months back and enjoyed it,  but there were a few quirks.   SwiftKey X allows me to customize the settings that really fit my style.  (I like to choose my words carefully,  so i reverted the spacebar to not auto-select.)   I liked the new &quot;learn from&quot; feature.   I gave it access to my email and Facebook, and it is much better at selecting my words.  I tried a few different keyboards (including Swype) and I like SwiftKey X the best.   Highly customizable and highly recommended.
B000RF7XYO|4.0|I'll try to make this as succinct as possible, this is a film you will want to watch for the quality of the performances, the camerawork, the elaborate costumes and settings, and the intriguing, overstuffed story.  However, if you were a student using this film as a study aid for a test on the initial reign of Elizabeth I, you'd flunk for sure!  The truth is stretched so far that if it were a spring it would break and snap back with a loud BOING!  What a pity, since the Tudor dynasty is strong enough to stand on the actual facts to spin an enthralling tale dramatically without all the phony embellishments.<br /><br />The story begins in the last years of the reign of the pathetic Queen Mary Tudor (Kathy Burke) of England who is slowly dying of a tumor.  Obsessed with her Roman Catholic religion, abandoned by her husband King Phillip of Spain, ill advised by the powerful Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), and other nobility and clergy she is near breakdown both physically and mentally.  She allows herself to be persuaded that her younger half sister the Princess Elizabeth (Cate Blanchett), heir to her crown, yet a Protestant is a possible traitor.  Mary has Elizabeth transported and confined to the Tower of London.  Although Mary has little love for Elizabeth, she cannot believe her guilty of treason and refuses to have her executed or disinherited.  Elizabeth is eventually released to Hatfield one of her country estates where she lives quietly until Mary dies and she assumes the throne.  However, her triumph is short lived as the fledgling queen is beset by serious problems, the treasury is empty, England threatened with an unfriendly neighbor, Scotland, the religious question divides the country, and she is pressured to marry and produce an heir.  In addition she has to juggle an importunate lover Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes),  a secretary of state who seeks to govern her, Sir William Cecil (Sir Richard Attenborough),  her enigmatic director of security Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), and the treacherous Duke of Norfolk who continues to be a malign presence.<br /><br />Front and center in this heady swirl of pageantry, sex, intrigue and melodrama is the star making performance of Cate Blanchett as the young Elizabeth.  I'd never seen Ms. Blanchett before this film, and I was astounded at just how accomplished she was in developing her portrayal.  Elizabeth Tudor was one of the most complex, brilliant women in history, a true Renaissance \\"Prince\\" in the Machiavellian sense.  She was capricious, a mass of contradictions, formidably intelligent yet neurotic, cool headed but possessed of a fiery temper, charismatic yet kept most people at arms length.  In turn she could be lion hearted, petty, shrewd, vain, generous, coquettish, diplomatic, bull headed, charming, devious and ruthless.  Ms. Blanchett is able to evoke most of these characteristics as she undergoes Elizabeth's journey from the vulnerable, imperiled princess at the beginning to the iconic, majestic Gloriana at the end, without ever losing the audience's interest or sympathy.  One of my favorite scenes is when Elizabeth is preparing to address a session of Parliament on the topic of religious conformity.  She makes the queen endearingly human as she nervously rehearses her speech aloud by herself, forgetting pieces, making corrections, getting frustrated and angry the same as any college student preparing for their first lengthy speech in Effective Presentation 101.  In terms of her appearance in the coronation scene at Westminster Abbey, clad in an ermine mantle over cloth of gold, jeweled gold crown perched atop her loose, flowing strawberry blonde hair Ms. Blanchett uncannily mirrors a famous portrait of Elizabeth in her coronation regalia. Her compelling, muti faceted portrayal heralded the arrival of an exciting, young actress brimming over with talent.  Deservedly her achievement was rewarded with a Best Actress Oscar nomination and wins forboth the Golden Globe and the British Film Academy Awards for Best Actress.<br /><br />Just as a fine diamond will sparkle more dazzlingly in the proper setting, an impressive supporting cast adds to the luster of Ms. Blanchett's portrait.  Heading this list is another newcomer, Joseph Fiennes, who as Elizabeth's great passion Sir Robert Dudley, greatly resembles a younger version of an actual portrait of Dudley with his brooding, gypsy like looks, and acts with a feverish recklessness.  Geoffrey Rush brings a cold blooded pragmatism to Sir Francis Walsingham, while Sir Richard Attenborough ably brings out the self-serving interest of Sir William Cecil.  The malevolence of Christopher Eccleston's Norfolk makes him a truly dangerous adversary to Elizabeth.  As the foppish, giddy Duke of Anjou, a would be suitor of Elizabeth, Vincent Cassel brings some moments of comic relief to the heavy drama.  The hysterical Queen Mary of Kathy Burke, a woman haunted by her failures evokes pity.  There is also a glimpse of the future James Bond, as Daniel Craig plays a small but key role as the Jesuit priest Father John Ballard.  Finally, in one of his last roles, theatrical great Sir John Gielgud has a quick cameo as the Pope.<br /><br />The settings and costumes are opulent and magnificent, all the splendors of Elizabeth's court, a Renaissance tapestry brought to life, the musical score is effectively used to underscore the events unfolding on the screen.  All were rewarded with Oscar nomiinations, a total of seven in all including Best Picture.  However the only trophy won was by Jenny Shicore for Best Makeup.<br /><br />Regarding the extras, director Shekhar Kupur does a commentary, an insightful glimpse into the vision of the film, and there are two good featurettes, the better of the two is \\"The Making of Elizabeth\\", which is more developed, but the second one \\"Elizabeth\\" is also worth a look.  Also when this DVD was released, the inferior sequel \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\\" was soon to open, there is a sneak peak at that as well.<br /><br />Though the film will certainly hold the average person's interest, the danger is that the uninformed viewer will take this very loose dramatic interpretation as the actual history of Elizabeth I and her early reign. So, by all means watch this if for no other reason than the glittering performance of Cate Blanchett, without it I would certainly drop the rating at least by one star.  Please remember though to go into this cleared eyed with the definite understanding that this is the writer and director's dramatic interpretation of the Elizabethan Age, and not the way it really was.  And, if you want to get a more accurate, balanced glimpse into a fascinating queen, try reading Alison Weir's excellent biography \\"The Life of Elizabeth I\\", published in 1998 the same year \\"Elizabeth\\" was released.d wins for both the Golden Globe and the British Film Academy Awards for Best Actress.

B00004S367|3.0|Music of my mind is for me the first album of the new musical career of Stevie Wonder in the 70´s. He played all instruments and produced this album. In my opinion this not a very good album, I suggest one that is beginning to collect Stevie Wonder to go to the next album which is \\"Talking Book\\", \\"Songs in the key of life\\", or \\"Innervisions\\". These are masterpieces. In music of my mind you can listen to some ideas, rythms and sounds that Stevie would develop in his next albums, though. The song Superwoman(Where were you when I neeeded you) is very nice. 3 stars for this album.

I was blown away by the brooding darkness lurking under that cheerful wrapper.   The rest of the album is the same, deep meaningful lyrics wrapped in happy catchy tunes. His songs make me want to dance and cry at the same time, and that's exactly what I do every time I listen.
B004Y1USV2|3.0|Well, when I reiceived the CD I really didn't expect so much , because it was clear that it was going to be a Downes/Horn album ...     Listning at it i 've had the confirm to my suspicious.     It is a good album , but mainly a Buggles album arranged by Yes.    The main track \\"Fly form here\\" is a nice soft-rock track.   Maybe it was better if 3-4minutes shorter ... it is enlonged by the usual \\"clichè\\" that the group put us in used to.     It is made of nice melodies, but it lacks of \\"genial-inventions\\" as we were in used to find on the seventies' albums.    There is a lack of Steve Howe that does just some embellishments here and there.   Benoit is a convincing singer.   The other tracks are good tracks , non really in yes style, maybe more in the  Asia style.     So it is an album that you can listen with pleasure but it is not a memorable one.  Its better than others , like \\"Open your Eyes\\" , but worse than \\"Drama\\" (the one that can be the direct comparative album)    The group continues to produce good tracks ... but not amazing tracks anymore.  The same can be said about \\"instrumentalism\\" ... you won't find here new original solos ... just the vocal parts made the melody ... other instruments are there to support the voice.
B0058ZEWPG|2.0|Quite a lot has been written about Lars Ulrich contributing to a great set of liner notes, including Dave's own writings. However, when I got the MP3 from Amazon last night (I really do like Amazon's cloud music service) the digital booklet wasn't included. Looking at the details, it was admittedly my fault for not seeing there was no [+booklet] listed and just assuming it came with it. But in case anyone else is interested in getting the booklet, you won't get it here and that's why I can only give it only two stars here.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i read the entire series in one weekend. ad i have to agree with the reviewer who likened it to enders game, one of my favorite books of all time. i was not sure what to expect when i saw all the violently negative reviews of this final book in the trilogy. but i knew that however it ended i would certainly not be indifferent. if your heart did not ache at several points in the earlier two books then you must be heartless.  and that is why this final book was what it had to be. not a triumph of good over evil or of some shining ideal of a just republic over a despotic arbitrarily cruel state.  nothing so impersonal as that. these books are intensely personal. and every decision katniss, gale, haymitch, darius, finnick, johanna and every one else makes are because that is who they are and not because the capitol forces them to act a certain way. even or especially peeta as he fights being hijacked. i think this is the important point that many who wanted some shining larger than life ending are missing.     how would katniss, always more a symbol than anything else, have assured a better government with liberty and justice for all? would she have governed? a seventeen year old whose only talents were hunting and killing and surviving? so much of the disappointment seems centered around her apathy and retreat. for those people i would ask, have you never felt grief? have you never experienced debilitating grief or impotent rage over the horrible things beyond your control? and yet katniss is not her mother. when those in her life need her she is there. not some abstract idea of a nation but when prim, or peeta, or gale need her she does not hesitate to act. that doesnt mean she cant fail or in this case be betrayed into failing. shes only human after all. but as collins shows, as card did in enders game, it is our choices that show what kind of human beings we are. not choices like who to vote for in a presidential election, but those intensely personal decisions likewho to trust with your heart, with your friendship, how much to compromise yourself to get what you want, is it revenge or justice you want and at what point you have had enough.      i dont think its coincidence that now two of my favorite books/series about the human condition center around children. stripped down of baggage that life and being an adult can bring, the choices of children are pure and more transparent and perhaps give clearer reflections of our own choices and motivations, more honestly and painfully at times than we might like

B0001NBMEE|3.0|Full of colour and pageantry, 1954's PRINCE VALIANT stars Robert Wagner (wearing a dutch-boy wig) in the title role plus lovely Janet Leigh as his lady fair.<br /><br />Dethroned and exiled to a secret location with his parents, Prince Valiant (Robert Wagner) decides to travel to Camelot in an attempt to become one of the mythical Knights of the Round Table.  There, he becomes squire to Sir Gawain (Sterling Hayden); but soon becomes suspicious of fellow knight Sir Brack (James Mason), who harbours a plan to usurp King Arthur (Brian Aherne), and also holds a powerful position with the despot who stole Valiant's own throne.  Naturally, along the way, there's room for romance with lovely Princess Aleta (Janet Leigh) and her younger sister Ilene (Debra Paget).<br /><br />Based on the popular King Features comic strip, PRINCE VALIANT is a colourful adventure romp.  Composer Franz Waxman's musical score swells amidst the clash of swords and the clatter of jousting knights.  It's a real Saturday matinee classic.  The performances are fine overall; Robert Wagner's only real drawback is his solid mid-American accent (which he does little to disguise).  One even becomes used to his dutch-cut wig after a while.  Janet Leigh was well-versed in playing medieval damsels in 1954; in the same year she also starred opposite her real-life husband Tony Curtis in \\"The Black Shield of Falworth\\".  A fun film when taken in the right spirit.<br /><br />For those with region-free setups, there is also a lovely Blu-ray edition of PRINCE VALIANT available in the UK.
1608870081|5.0|Wonderful book! We saw this first at a museum that had a 3D art exhibit. It took the attention of my 6 year old son and 7 year old nephew. I immediately went home and ordered 3 of them, 1 for each of them and one for my 5 year old nephew as well. They all love them! The page with the dragon on it is their favorite. But every little boy that comes over to the house loves this book. I even love it. Highly recommend.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|Let the Right One In is a recent vampire movie, but it's also one of the better melancholy films I've seen. It's set in a small Swedish town that lies in the shadow of the Iron Curtain and under a foot of snow. Oskar, a withdrawn and bullied 12-year-old, lives in a small apartment with his mother, an unconcerned parent. (In a clichéd, but nonetheless poignant, scene, she asks him how he got a cut on his face and unhesitatingly accepts his answer, admonishing him to be more careful on the playground.) Oskar dreams of exacting violent revenge on his tormentors, going so far as to act out scenes with a pocketknife. He also covertly collects newspaper clippings about murders and other grisly incidents. But the most troubling thing about him is his apparent detachment from his predicament. It's not that he's underconcerned or perversely content with being bullied; it's that he responds dispassionately, as if he's come to terms with hopelessness. He doesn't ever run, cry, or raise his voice, even though he's clearly suffering and has been engaged in an internal struggle over whether, and if so when, to strike back. Notably, we have every reason to believe that he regards striking back as the ideal. It is not compassion or an aversion to &#34;lowering&#34; himself that stays his hand, but rather something else, such as the inherent gravity of revolutionary action. Perhaps he is also concerned with the physical act of revenge, for he takes up weight training under the tutelage of his amiably eccentric gym teacher.  One night, in the snowfield outside his apartment building, Oskar meets Eli (rhymes with deli), who recently moved in next door. She is also 12, in her words, &#34;more or less.&#34; Though Oskar maintains his emotional flatness in her presence -- even after she confirms her sanguinivorous nature -- he is obviously fascinated. He begins, shly, to let her in. He tells her about the bullies, and she advises him to hit back. He questions her willingness to kill, and she points out his. Eli and Oskar are both sympathetic characters in that they are constantly victimized by circumstance, but they are not innocent characters. They are both outsiders, but they must confront the conventional world. Naturally, they are drawn together, certain irreconcilable differences be damned. The subsequent plot developments are largely unremarkable, but their execution is wondrous and moving.  Often, the film successfully resonates by economizing on the explicit, in the same way that a lingering shot of a snowscape can say more about doleful desolation than could even a Roy Batty voiceover. For instance, there are two scenes in which I recall Oskar expressing childlike delight in contrast to his usual aloofness: one where he goes sledding while visiting his dad, and another where he and his mom start brushing their teeth in unison and turn to each other with amusement in their eyes, perhaps engaging in a nightly ritual for the thousandth time. These glimpses of realistic domesticity -- a rare treat in film -- flesh out the viewer's psychological portrait of Oskar; they suggest that he is not entirely consumed by his bullying and not always so removed from the viscerality of emotion -- that he _feels_ his pleasure and therefore his pain. In another telling domestic scene, a man arrives while Oskar is hanging out at the dinner table with his dad, and the relaxed mood immediately shifts: Oskar stiffens, and his father, invoking the obligation of hospitality, gets the door and pours a couple of drinks. Oskar quickly leaves, and we are left to wonder what prompted his anxiety. His dad comes across as a genial, easygoing man, but is he a horrible drunk? Is the other man his lover? Was Oskar simply crushed by the disruption of his fragile tranquility? Such moments bow my heart strings as much as the bullying, because they convey the tortuous inner life of a tortured child. And like the wordless scenes of delight, they do so in a way that leaves unnecessary details to the richness of imagination.  Let the Right One In also succeeds atmospherically. From the opening fade-in of a gentle flurry, snow plays a prominent role in the film. Fittingly, there is something about snow that complements the vampiric. Perhaps it is that snow signifies short, dark days. Perhaps it is that in its presence we cling bitterly to the very warmth that the vampire craves. Perhaps it is the lifelessness of a whited-out landscape. Perhaps it is simply our association of cold and death. At any rate, the omnipresence of snow contributes to the town's air of remoteness and repose. There is little vivacity in the dead of winter, and the moonlight, reflected and amplified by the snow, bathes the town in a subdued, blue-tinged glow. Practically, it is hard to argue that a vampire wouldn't be better off in a big city, where victims are anonymous and hideouts are plentiful, but aesthetically Eli has come to the right place. Overall, the film's atmosphere is in harmony with its pacing -- the exposition of important plot developments is unhurried, and the viewer is given time and space to reflect on characters' experiences. Thus, while the film has its share of violent and passionate events, its intensity is never at odds with its contemplative tone.  I am compelled to discuss Let the Right One In's take on vampirism, because a review of a vampire movie isn't worth its weight in blood without such a discussion, and also because the film presents a particularly compelling account. Most significantly, Let the Right One In does not glamorize vampirism. Many vampires, particularly the more recent creations, are charismatic creatures who -- bloodthirst and daylight curfew aside -- have transcended their physicality in the manner of ageless superheroes. We are inclined to envy them, especially in this age of blood banks and limitless indoor stimulation. Not so with Eli, who, in the vein of Nosferatu, elicits an uneasy sympathy. She is trapped in a child's body, so she is limited in her ability to function independently and feed ethically. She possesses preternatural physical prowess, but she is unable to seduce or entrance her victims. When she is underfed, she smells of death. She derives no apparent pleasure from the taking of life. Yet take life she does, wantonly at that, so we cannot comfortably sympathize. She is still childlike in many respects, despite her apparently great age, so perhaps her responsibility is diminished. Indeed, with the selfishness of a child, she has rationalized her murderousness as a need, and is apparently unburdened by the arguable moral imperative to end her life. Moreover, we cannot help but perceive her as a child, for fundamental elements of her identity have been frozen in time. But there is no escaping the fact that she is a serial killer, albeit probably not the first one you've rooted for.  Oskar certainly seems to have few qualms about this fact. After all, he is 12 and troubled, and he is in love, or something like it. But so is Eli. At first, she prudently attempts to dissuade his efforts at friendship, but it is clear that she, too, is suffering from loneliness. (For how long has she endured a life of permanent juvenility, perpetual night, forced seclusion, and desensitized murder?) Soon it is not just Oskar who is opening his heart.  It is wonderful to watch their love unfold, but it is also tragic. The romantic endeavors of 12-year-olds do not ordinarily inspire such gravity, but in this case it feels appropriate. Together Oskar and Eli have found a happiness it seems they had never known, but it is a happiness that cannot last. Oskar will become a teenager, then a man, and they will have to let each other go. But all is not lost if they never regret having let each other in.

B004EPYZPS|5.0|This is a great movie, and takes you back to your childhood.    How so? Well imagine the ideas used in Scooby Doo, the Goonies, the Monster Squad and countless other franchises of young kids working together to overcome a supernatural force and that's pretty close to what Super 8 is all about.    Once again, it seems JJ Abrams can do no wrong, and with Mr Spielberg involved too - this film is as close to perfect as you will find this summer.    If you like this kind of thing, I might also suggest you check out the following two books: Department 19 by Will Hill, and the Dusk Society by Campfire Graphic Novels.
B000002G87|5.0|How these guys got together is still one of those magic moments in rock and roll history creating an album genre that's not been duplicated before or since in history. Pretty big words from a nonreviewer. This album in some ways reminds me of Eric Clapton's time with the John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers but then again the arrangements are pure Clapton. Mix in Duanne Allman and you've got a masterpiece never to be redone. I could review each and every song on the album but in the end all the tracks would receive a 5 star rating. If you like blues or rock n roll, if you like dream guitar riffs, if you like the kind of music that takes you back to the time in your life where everything was magical, buy this album!
B0045TYDNC|5.0|After I purchased the relatively new 55-300mm lens, I noticed that it shipped with a different rear cap than any other lens I have purchased.  This was the LF-4 cap.  After making note of this, I began paying attention to the practical differences between the LF-4 and the original LF-1.<br /><br />First, the LF-4 is much easier to grip than the LF-1.  The two differences are the thicker and longer ribs and the matted finish of the plastic on the exterior.  Both of these combine for easier \\"on-and-off's\\" during lens changes, especially if your hands are somewhat damp, for whatever reason.<br /><br />Secondly, the LF-4 has a flange that increases the coverage for the rear of the lens body.  This certainly seems to provide more of a weather-tight seal, exposing less aluminum to the environment.  As for the precision of the fit between the lens and the LF-4, this seems equal to the LF-1.  However, with the improved grip, it is possible to tighten it down more to the lens body, especially since removal is easier.<br /><br />One more thing.  To me, the LF-4 seems like it would have more \\"give\\" during an impact than the original LF-1, due to the type of plastic used for its construction. This is strictly opinion based on feel alone, and it may be an illusion only.<br /><br />After using both caps for some time, on various lenses, I believe I will be replacing all of my LF-1's with the newer LF-4's.  This cap may not be for everyone, or every lens for that matter.  However, for me, the added \\"sense\\" of security is enough to make the switch.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|You can do a little focusing with it, but not very much. Bright! You can likely keep your end cap and not install the switch portion. the switch is a little flimsy, protrudes slightly and rattles a little. It works like a charm, has a good action to it, and because it protrudes, it's easy to click on when you need it. But it's real easy to turn on, so you could drain your batteries by accidentally leaving turning it on. to avoid this, i would snug down the focus, just as you would to turn it off before, and then ignore the switch, just leave it on. of belt and suspenders, and keep both in the off position. 5 stars if the switch was firmer and had a better feel. Otherwise a perfect addition.

This trilogy is really one very long book, published in three volumes.  You really should read the first one first.  That said, I devoured all three of these books and mourn that the author died.  I would buy anything that he wrote! \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" was just as engrossing as the first book and the last book - \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\".

0307387178|5.0|From the Back Cover:  In April 1992, Chris McCandless, a young man from a well to do family, hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness. He had given all his savings to charity, abandoned his car and possessions, burnt all the money in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a hunter...    Jon Krakauer, bestselling author of Into Thin Air, uses McCandless' restless progress around the wide spaces of North America to explore the call of the wild and the mentality of those who succumb to it. What emerges from this mesmerising, heartbreaking story is a version of the wilderness that is hard and seductive; a place where one can quite possibly find one's self, but also opening the dark possibility that we might find our own nature strange and disturbing.    Review:  As a general rule, I don't read non-fiction, it's just not my kind of thing and I usually end up feeling pretty bored by it. There are some occasions where my interest is piqued enough that I want to know more about something, and that was the case with this book. I had seen the film, Into the Wild which I really loved, but couldn't really make up my mind how I felt about Chris McCandless. In the Author's Note at the beginning of the book, Jon Krakauer says that his original article about his death generated an enormous amount of mail, with people falling into two camps:  'Some readers admired the boy immensely for his courage and noble ideals; others fulminated that he was a reckless idiot, a wacko, a narcissist who perished out of arrogance and stupidity'  This is what I couldn't make my mind up about, and I decided to read the book to try to find out more.    The book opens with the account of the man who drove McCandless to the place where he began his trek into the wilds of Alaska, and follows with the story of the hunters who found his body in the bus where he had made camp. The book contains the information Krakauer discoveredabout McCandless' life before leaving his family and the two years he spent wandering around America. Interspersed is stories of other wanderers, and a depiction of his own wilderness adventure as a young man. All of this information paints the picture of a young man who had not found his place in the world, was confused and had a restless and passionate spirit who was looking for some semblance of truth in a world he couldn't understand.    It would be easy on the one hand to consider McCandless a self absorbed jerk. In fact, so many of his ideals have been perfectly satirised by Christian Lander at Stuff White People Like, especially #9 Making You Feel Bad About Not Going Outside, #17 Hating Their Parents, #101 Being Offended and #120 Taking a Year Off. It does seem to me that McCandless was experiencing a kind of extended adolescence, needing to be different, railing against conformity and searching for meaning, but only within the boundaries he feels safe in.    There's a real irony to the fact that the very society he so despised both provided him with the economic freedom to pursue his ideology in the first place, and provided the kind of organised safety net with which to fling himself upon the world. Had he been raised in poverty, had he had to fight hard for his place in University, he might have found his education a blessing, not a curse. If he really wanted to go off into an alternate way of living, he could have taken himself off to any non-democratic, third world country and burnt his remaining money there.    Some of the things he wrote to his sister about their parents show a great misunderstanding of his importance to them and how his actions affected them, and disregard for their feelings:  '...I'm going to let them think that I'm 'coming around to see their side of things' and that our relationship is stabilising. And then, once the time is right I'm going to completely knock them out of my life...I'll be through with them once and for all, forever'  But, it can't be that he was simply an arrogant and misguided young man. As Krakauer says  'McCandless made an indelible impression on a number of people during the course of his hegira, most of whom spent only a few days in his company, a week or two at most.'  And many of his writings and letters to his friends reveal a passionate mind, full of the joy of living, discovery and adventure.    It's pretty clear that the author has the agenda of presenting the sympathetic argument regarding Chris McCandless' choices in the telling of the tale. In the end, I guess I've decided that McCandless was both the careless narcissist and the adventurer with the high ideals. People are complicated and are different things to different people. I get the impression that the actions he took were necessary for his personal development and his sense of himself, but he seriously underestimated how important he was to his family, and how his actions effected them. There's a section in the end where Krakauer is confronted by Mrs McCandless' grief and he says her weeping  'betrays a sense of loss so huge and irreparable that the mind balks at taking its measure. Such bereavement makes even the most eloquent apologia for high-risk activities ring fatuous and hollow.'  I can't help but feel that a mind like McCandless' is a rare and wondrous thing. Yes, he caused suffering and made stupid decisions, but who is to say what is or isn't important for another person, and of all the options of life available, what will be life changing for them. There's only one life and we all try to live it to the best of our abilities, in the end, I think that's what McCandless was trying to do - his death was an accident of poor planning. Had he lived, with time and maturity he might have come to understand his importance to other people, and the great responsibility that comes of being loved. Maybe he would have tempered his passions with reason and become a more balanced thinker and philosopher.    This is a really interesting read into the psychology of freedom, and I highly recommend it.
B002CSC5EC|5.0|This is the first time I saw this film.  The content is excellent, with many great performances and interviews.  Most importantly the ambiance of the event comes through in a way you can not only see and hear, but feel it.  The Blu-ray features fantastic picture and sound, most especially for a 40-year-old material.  The extras on the second disk are very satisfying, with acts such as Leslie West and Mountain, that did not make it into the film, just because it did not promote the documentary's message, an otherwise great performance.  There are also revealing interviews with the filmmakers.  I enthusiastically recommend it!

0061801313|4.0|I bought this set for my 13 year old daughter, who loved it.  Only took her about 2 weeks to read all four books.  I would have given it 5 stars, but we were under the impression that the TV series was close to true to the books and it's not.  The story line is significantly different with some characters going in different directions than the series.  Still a great series for Tweens and up; just different from the TV series.
0760335540|5.0|The problem with writing a review on books like this (and shop manuals) is that unless you've actually used the book to do several projects, you just can't really know how good/bad it is.     That said, based on my reading/scanning, 101 Projects is well written -- the amount of detail in the descriptions seems about right. The photography is excellent. The photos are all in focus and most of all the lighting is superb, especially compared to a number of after market shop manuals I've seen. The book is backed up by a website with additional material and photos though I haven't tried it yet.     Nicely done -- I'd recommend it to any Boxster owner looking for some ideas and \\"how To\\" information on projects for his/her car.

B004TTZHBK|5.0|I got this app for free, but would definitely pay the $3.99 it is currently priced at (not sure about paying $7.99 for an app, though). So far, I have learned some proper knife skills, how to fry a great steak, and how to handle onions, garlic, herbs... and made what I and my husband both felt was a restaurant-quality meal (steak and balsamic-glazed mushrooms). That is DEFINITELY more than I can say about any other app on my phone.    The instructional videos are fantastic, and definitely useful for someone like me who does alright in the kitchen, but could definitely learn a thing or two. The recipes have ingredient and equipment lists, which you can turn into a grocery list so you can make sure you have everything you'll need, and it's really nice to have the recipes in my phone to begin with, in case I'm at the grocery store trying to figure out what to cook, I can just browse the app real quick, and *voila* I know what I'm going to cook and what I need to buy! The recipes also include step by step instructions with pictures, and occasional reminders from Jamie to keep you from overcooking something when you've moved onto another part of the meal preparation.    Overall, I LOVED it, and just wish I had more recipes!
B003Y5H59W|4.0|It should come as no surprise that this mid-summer 2011 entry into the Marvel Comics-originated series would be the most unabashedly old-fashioned of all the Avengers-related sagas, but what is admirable about this particular epic adventure is how committed director Joe Johnston ([[ASIN:B0006FYOTC October Sky]]) and co-screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely ([[ASIN:B00005JPH2 The Chronicles of Narnia]]) appear to be in telling their somewhat revisionist story with such patriotic, good-versus-evil fervor on its own comic-book terms. There is nothing emotionally complex about the tale of this familiar superhero beyond a standard-issue time-travel element to bring all the Avengers storylines together. Bookended by present-day scenes, the bulk of the story focuses on our stalwart hero and his primary adversary, and how they confront each other during the height of World War II. In many respects, the film has a spiritual kinship with earlier retro-style epics like [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Raiders of the Lost Ark]] and the 1977 version of [[ASIN:B000K4X5XA Superman]].<br /><br />The historical part of the story begins in Norway where we see renegade Nazi Johann Schmidt uncovering an extraordinary power source which he plans to use for global domination. Meanwhile back in the US, diminutive and physically weak Steve Rogers is trying desperately to serve his country in the military, but he can't get past his 4-F status. His plucky tenacity does not go unnoticed as &eacute;migr&eacute; military scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine selects him for a highly risky experiment that will transform him into a muscular soldier with superhuman strength and speed. He performs a heroic act of derring-do against a Nazi spy that throws him immediately into the spotlight, and the US government decides to use him to sell savings bonds at patriotic USO revues. However, when Steve finds out his best buddy \\"Bucky\\" Barnes is lost behind enemy lines, Captain America is truly born complete with his indestructible Vibranium shield. Naturally, he not only saves \\"Bucky\\" but the entire battalion who were given up for dead. All of this merely sets up the final showdown with the evil Schmidt, who has transformed himself into Red Skull, the super-powered head of HYDRA, the Nazi's occult research arm.<br /><br />While the action in the second half is well-paced and impressively choreographed, it also feels increasingly overblown when you consider how Captain America steadfastly remains a beacon of service and loyalty as a direct contrast to the megalomania of Red Skull. The finale feels anti-climactic in many ways. Already familiar to Marvel fans as the hot-headed Johnny Storm/\\"The Human Torch\\" in the [[ASIN:B00005JNTU Fantastic Four]] movies, Chris Evans does surprisingly well playing such an earnest character, especially the first part where CGI effects turn him into the classic 98-pound weakling. Hugo Weaving has a field day as Schmidt, even if his character's motivations start to come across as simplistic. Other actors fare just as well if somewhat predictably given the lack of true dimension they are given to play - Toby Jones (Truman Capote in [[ASIN:B000M341SC Infamous]]) as HYDRA's No. 2, Dr. Arnim Zola; Stanley Tucci as the slyly supportive Erskine; and Tommy Lee Jones in full military bluster as Colonel Chester Phillips. Only Hayley Atwell comes across as too wan to play the tough-acting strategic officer Peggy Carter, Steve's romantic interest which the filmmakers barely have time to explore.

Does a good job of mixing up the different weapons you can use, though I find that I only really need 2 of the 5 or 6 available weapons on a given map to beat it.

0545123275|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book to me while we were browsing at Barnes & Noble, and I was extremely skeptical as I steer clear of anything resembling Twilight. We returned to my house and read in silence together. For the first time in years, despite my severe reading impairment due to OCD, I didn't want to put a book down. The concept is extremely creative (I feel foolish for even comparing it to Twilight) and Maggie did a wonderful job describing the lovely environment and characters as the story progressed in an enjoyably stable way. I'm still working on Linger and I just bought Forever, and I know this will be one of those series I'll sigh with sadness to put down but inevitably pick up again in the future. I never thought I'd like a teen werewolf story, but I'm hooked on Steifvater's Wolves of Mercy Falls series and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good plot, interesting and realistic characters, a compelling romance, and even a few good laughs, regardless of your age or gender.

0553801473|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed reading it but with some serious misgivings about the book.<br /><br />I'd say the biggest flaw in the book is the sheer number of characters.  There are just too many characters I don't like.  And by don't like, I mean I find them boring, not that I don't like the way they act or their personality.  Plus, Martin spends too many pages just describing scenery and what kind of clothing people are wearing.  Too much of the book feels like padding only there to fill in some pages.<br /><br />The series itself has now become so long and the story so complex that even though I've read every book in the series, I've lost track of who some of the characters are.  Some chapters feature characters that I have no idea who they are or what they're doing.<br /><br />Nothing gets resolved in this book.  No major plotlines have come to a conclusion.  We still don't know who the Others are or why the dead are coming back to life.  And that was a plot point featured in the prologue of the very first book!  The whole book just feels like a swimmer treading water, just keeping his head above the ocean and not going anywhere.<br /><br />To sum it up:<br /><br />Some very good and interesting characters and stories in the book.  But there are just too many boring patches and too many characters I don't care about.<br /><br />I wish this book had been the final book in the series.  Not just because I don't want to wait another 5 years for the next book but because the series itself is becoming so long and complicated.  If the next book comes out in a year or two I'll probably get it.  But if it takes longer than that forget it.<br /><br />I give it a 3 stars out of 5 rating.
B0054TKBBA|4.0|I never intended to watch this show.  It was some silly thing for teenyboppers.  And it is that in part but I was convinced to watch it after listening to \\"Wolf Week\\" on Kevin Smith's S.I.R. network and I found the cast funny and engaging so I decided to give it a try.  It is a bit silly but at the end of the pilot I honestly wanted to know what happened to the characters and I liked them.  There was enough action and character moments to keep you engaged
B005BW15XS|5.0|I am so proud of Miss Kelly Rowland's growth! This album is sooooooo good and I am so proud of her. This album shows a new different side of Kelly and I love it! She really worked her butt off and it paid off. I love every last song on this album and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. I would HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone. Its a diverse album, meaning every song is different. There is something for everyone on this album. Go ahead Miss Kelly and shine =)
B004WJRF6C|4.0|Have to agree with all the other 4- and 5-star reviews here.  Brings back memories for me of the summer of 1970 (I was 13), the Beatles' breakup, and lost innocence.  I get a kick out of all the Lennon and Harrison snobs out there -- so full of themselves.  Yes, Lennon and Harrison were amazing.  McCartney was at least equally as talented and probably the best pop music tunesmith of our time.  \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" alone is worth the price of the CD.  The remastering is excellent.  If you're a Beatles fan of any stripe, I'd say you have to add this CD to your collection.
B004LROMSO|5.0|I'm devastated that Camelot was cancelled! I thought the sets and costumes were Emmy-nomination-worthy. The excellent acting was raw and real. Problems with King Arthur casting? Really? JCB did an awesome job! It's make-believe. Why can't he be King Arthur?! The cliff-hanger ending leaves soooo much more to be written. Shame on the powers-that-be who cancelled this unique, entertaining classic!
0739375970|1.0|I just finished the fifth book.  Although I am still interested in finding out how the Game of Thrones will end (in book 6, please) it seems that the fifth book unraveled more than it tied up.  In the 1980's I quit reading a certain series about a mystical gunslinger when it seemed the author had lost his way.  I waited until the series was complete to pick it back up. Perhaps that time has come again.
B005CMSDKA|2.0|I won't pull any punches: HANNA is just plain awful. It's a movie with multiple personalities that don't mesh. It's almost like the 3 main actors, Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana, and Cate Blanchett, are in three separate movies that occasionally bump into each other and none of them make sense. The basic plot is that Cate Blanchett is a CIA manager, and Eric Bana used to be one of her agents about 15 years before. They were involved in a Super Soldier experiment that came to an end at which point, Bana was supposed to kill all the participants. He didn't. Instead, he takes baby Hanna into hiding and trains her up to be a lethal asset. Why? Because Bana thinks Blanchett will come for her. After 15 years. So what does he do? He turns on a homing beacon to tell Blanchett here they're hiding. Why? And why would she care after 15 years? Then all heck breaks loose after which Ronan goes on a coming-of-age odyssey I won't bore you with. And then it ends.<br /><br />HANNA has kinds of Felini-esque imagery which just adds to the what-the...? factor. If you like quirky, stream of conscious movies, then you might like HANNA. But you couldn't get me to watch it again for all the Pecan Sandies in the Keebler Treehouse.
0553801473|3.0|After a few years of anticipation, of thinking about what wonderful twists and surprises GRRM will showcase, the main thing I took away from this book was that his new favorite word is \\"neeps.\\" I suppose he probably traveled to the UK and discovered this plain but filling fare, and was perhaps enamored of it and immediately decided \\"yes, here is an authentic dish that fits within my world of Westeros,\\" and then proceeded to insert a platter of them upon every trestle table in every chapter. For that, he earns a polite golf clap.<br /><br />Neeps aside, the book spends a great deal of time doing very little. We learn that a previously-cocky former ward has been reduced to rather wretched circumstances... repeatedly. Daenarys does a whole lot of nothing, but does get her groove on or think about doing so quite a bit. Our favorite dwarf is frequently reminded that he is a dwarf, does well at board games, and otherwise does nothing. Jon Snow tries to gather as many wildlings as possible to sing Kumbaya. And somehow it all takes a thousand pages.<br /><br />There are also peculiar conclusion chapters for two viewpoint characters from a Feast for Crows, Jaime and Cersei, that rather mundanely continue from the less-than-nailbiting cliffhangers of that last book. And also a soap-opera introduction of a young lad who will probably be a point-of-view character in comings books, but in the mean time seems like a dull and flavorless insertion but for his surprising identity. We also see that start of how all the little secrets of the past, like Ned's promise to Lyanna, and perhaps Jon Snow's parentage, will be revealed in future books, thanks to trees. Nice work, trees.<br /><br />Overall, it was a meandering middle book that strives to provide a proper setup for some grand conclusion. As a book of it's own, it's not so great; you'll read it because you've already formed an interest in the characters from the fine writing of the first three books. I suppose it rather reminds me of the stumblings of Robert Jordan. But with neeps instead of braid-tugging. The feeling of greatness that the series carries really petered out in this volume; the danger, excitement, and hazards for the main characters all felt like they were shelved, to be put on hold for the next book, where things might actually happen.
1599219751|4.0|What a great story about people who refuse to die! The story, after a while, seems almost unbelievable and I just kept reading wanting them to all make it. But, as goes life things worth fighting or dying for have a cost to all human endeavors of great achievement. One flaw, which isn't the fault of the author, was how these brave souls ended their story without a conclusion. If you read this book DO NOT see the movie! The movie was a HUGE let down. Quite sad as this story had the makings of Oscar award winning acclaim.
0553801473|3.0|The Reader, having broken his fast on over medium eggs and thick cut bacon fried extra crispy and having outfitted himself in a white Fat Tire t-shirt and red jogging shorts, sat down to write a review of the latest George RR Martin book, A Dance with Dragons.  His efforts were immediately thwarted however by his five year old daughter, a maid of five wearing a pink satin night shirt and possessing of none of the precocity of the babes in Martin's books, requesting toast and jelly on which to break her fast.  After several minutes of intense negotiations, the toast a jelly was bartered down to a fruit bar, a food item requiring quite a bit less in the way of toasting and jelly spreading than the original request.<br /><br />Alas, turning back to his original task, the Reader found himself overcome with a bought of malaise.  He spent the next half hour fruitlessly playing minesweeper and wondering what he could say that hadn't already been said.  He agreed with most of the points that others were making -- too long, too little progress, inconsistent characters, needlessly discursive -- and had nothing either new or insightful to add.  The Reader crossed his arms and stared out of his kitchen window.  One hundred and five degree heat index today, he thought.  Will winter ever come?<br /><br />With a sigh that bespoke of resignation and deferred satisfaction, the reader put a hand, still slightly shinny with bacon grease, atop his computer screen and began to swivel it down.  There'll be another book in five...maybe six years tops, he reasoned.  We waited 15 years for the Star Wars prequels and look how well that turned out.  Besides, there's a world of books out there.  Short books.  Books with three acts, with beginnings, middles, and endings.  Books by authors who don't maliciously tease you.  The lid was almost two thirds closed now, just before that point where the screen flickers off.  Nobody cares what you think anyway...opinions and arm pits and all that.  You're just another voice among thousands, screaming at the walls, the sounds bounding and rebounding, constructive and destructive interference taking place until it's all just one cacophonous roar.  The lid is down now, the latch just about to engage.  Other books, he thinks again, yes there lies the path to recovery...to reconciliation. That and HBO.  Click.
B003M731UE|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE it this series is amazing well acted you fall in love in a strange werird way can watch over and over again and i do :)
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I am not a 30 Rock fan. Nor am I a mother in the entertainment industry. But this book was excellent. Tina Fey has a way of making every detail in every story truly entertaining. I never felt like reading it became a chore, as I often do with celebrities' books. The \\"jokes\\" are more humorous than comedic, but no less amusing. The greatest part, as said in other reviews, is the non-comedy material sprinkled throughout. I hope for many more like this to come. There's a reason this book is #1 and it has nothing to do with hype. Good quality work.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|it was a great book. I loved the characters and their story. it was extremely realistic and down to earth with everything thta happens in college life for a lot students. one thing i loved about it was the \\"don't judge a book by the cover\\" theme with pretty much all of the characters. great read and it has become my number 1 book :)
1936719118|4.0|The author isn't kidding when he says you can finish this book in an hour. It's small, but the content and lessons learned come from personal experience in the real world. We currently are living in a world where far too many are writing books based on no personal experience or achievement. If you're a CEO of a huge company but you played no role in the initial start up, that's a whole different world and has nothing to do with entrepreneurism.    The core lessons communicated which impacted me?    1) Only launch products that prospective buyers are crazy about. No \\"maybe's\\". It has to be a \\"YES!! And here's my money\\" or move on to something else.    2) Be flexible and listen to your customers. If you start hearing the same suggestions by a majority of your buyers repeatedly, fulfill those requests if it's financially viable to do so.    3) Learn how to do most of the work yourself. This makes you an expert so when the time comes you can train your new employees effectively and you can keep tabs on the job their doing because you know the job inside and out    4) Don't let your employees run away with the company. It's great to delegate once you grow to a scale where you need the extra minds and hands, but you need to stay actively involved AND you need to continue to hold the reigns. The author appears to have gotten so caught up in one aspect of the business (writing code for the site) that his employees eventually took on the attitude that the company was theirs!    All the lessons are suggested out of humility as this guy never dreamed his CD Baby would become as big as it did. He simply provided a service first to himself (as a musician), which he later provided to his friends, then friends of friends, and so on.    I bought it, read it and am using these lessons every day with my Monk Pak business (custom packs). I am now really trying to assess the hits from the duds. Find your breakout product. Then scale! In theory it sounds simple. In practice it's an art.Two thumbs up for Anything You Want...
B001HNE3NO|5.0|i loved this book. i read it so fast because i couldnt put it down. the way the author takes two sides of the story, the past and present, and intertwines them to reveal secrets that have been kept for years is just amazing. i thought it was so interesting and it will make you cry. the book is very touching and is also educational in that it talks alot about wht happened to the Jews in the Holocaust, like how they were \\"rounded up\\" (as used in the book)    i think everyone should at least read this book once if they have any interest in the holocaust. its not just facts but actually has a great and tragic story behind it.    i can't wait to watch the movie.

I also enjoyed getting the new achievements (I played the PC version last year). The one thing I miss is the garden where you can collect plants. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who has enough space on their phone.

STWOF may not have as much screaming as We stitch these wounds but this album should and would be vited world's greatest album if have the people today weren't obsessed over bands not nearly as great as this. I listend to this 24 times in first 3 days it was out beacuse i couldn't put it down GREAT WORK
0743496728|2.0|I ordered this book thinking that it was just a normal hard cover book... But then, I got it in the mail opened it up and saw that it was the large print edition!! Nowhere in the descripition of this book did it say that it was a large print book. The shipping and everything else about this book was great, but the large print kind of spoils it!

0380977273|5.0|My personal favorite of Ray Bradbury, and the first of his I ever read. This book is one of his most classic and timeless contributions to science fiction. I must buy for anyone.
1936719010|5.0|This book is a great resource for anyone who is having a hard time getting started or staying on target. It is written with knowledge, wit, and clarity. I will reread it everytime I hit resistance.
1595141715|5.0|I read this book last semester, but I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to encourage someone to read it, that I would. So, here I am. Because this isn't a book that I loved for the romance, or the suspense, or any other singular thing. I loved this book because it taught me something. The writing was perfection binded into a book, and I'd like to think that it changed the way I view things, at least I try to keep it in my mind when I make decisions. So forgive me if this review is slightly more about the things the book made me feel than the book itself- because honestly- they are SO intertwined!!  This book is hard to review because there is very little I can say without spoiling, but I'm going to try!  The book deals with suicide. But it is SO much more than that. It's about the after effects of it just as much as it was about the things that lead up to the horrific event.  Hannah Baker was lost, and she had no one to turn to. No one she could trust. So in the days leading to her death, she made 13 tapes. Each tape for one person that led to her suicide in some form or fashion. And this is what was so... overwhelming about the book. Not every event was something monumentally tragic and horrific. In fact, only a hand few of them were. But each event led to so much more, or were on the tip of another storm of events that it impacted her so much more.  Clay is the narrator of the story, and it's with him that we experience the pain and loss of Hannah's death as he listens to the tapes as he walks through the empty streets of this sad empty town he lived in. I could picture everything. And it wasn't because Asher spent a lot of time on the minute details, because he didn't, but because the emotions were so raw, it was impossible not to see the things Clay saw in front of him. The people she spoke of on the tape. His anger, his confusion, his grief- it was all so palpable as it came off the page, and engulfed me into this story. This story that I hadn't expected to be so... poignant. Although maybe I should have known. I knew it was about death, but I hadn't expected it to be so hard to get through. But it was completely because of my attachment to the story that made it so hard to finish  (due to the crying!), and nothing to do with the wonderful story told.  When I finished the book, I called my best friend, and told her that I loved her, and that I'm here for her, and that she's never alone. And that she should NEVER not talk about something. Because these things build until they break you, and soon you're in too deep to see the way out. And it's so avoidable. So. preventable.  Another thing it taught me was that you don't have to be intentionally cruel to be hurtful. Which seems like common sense, but this book- it shows it differently. A prank changed Hannah's life forever, and she didn't even know it at the time. She'd laughed it off. She knew it wasn't meant to be cruel. But it was high school, and not everyone took it so lightly. And it ruined everything.  I guess what I'm saying is, if you read this book, (which I really hope that you do!) I hope you get as much out of it as I do! And that you are more aware of your actions, because you never know how big the iceberg is going to be that sinks the ship.  I really believe this is a book that everyone should read. Even though it deals with suicide, it deals with so much more about life.  A+!!!!!!
B003ODL004|5.0|A musical genius, I loved this soundtrack. Hans Zimmer knows how to tap into your emotions and he does that with this soundtrack.   It doesn't get any better than this.
0743201140|5.0|Really liked this book for 2 reasons.  First, through the online tool, one can learn their 5 dominant talents, and learn what they represent.  Secondly, the contents share how best to work with others who have likewise identified their natural talents as well.  A terrific book which will certainly help readers better develop their relationships with others while similarly concentrating how best use their own talents in their lives.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Awesome movie!  You've gotta have it in your collection :)  Even my 3 year old quotes it--all the time!  Way cute.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't put in to words how much I love this book. Not even close. There's something about the way Collins writes that makes you fall so deeply in love with specific characters. As you keep reading, you feel the pain of losing and loving them as the story runs its course. Maybe you want Katniss to stay with Peeta in the end but find that her heart, and yours, is remembering why she loved Gale in the first place. So you're torn, here in this spot, where events keep occurring and the one moment you feel like everything will be okay for Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and everyone else you have learned to love in this book, the unthinkable happens.  These books are unbelievable.
0143038419|4.0|Loved her time in Italy. Loved her time in India. Was a little disappointed with the ending. I was hoping for more. But overall I liked this book and would recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series of books is amazing! I love the whole plot and there is rarely a dull moment. It's interesting to watch Katniss Everdeen change throughout the book, through her tragedies and her difficult love. It leaves you thinking, trying to guess what will happen next. Truth is, you'll probably be wrong; about almost everything you think will happen. Read this book, and prepare to expect the unexpected.
0143118757|4.0|I am a business undergrad I purchased this book because of our professor's recommendation. Since I don't have a lot of experience negotiating, it has been an eye-opening experience for me to read this book. It points out and provides concept to behaviors/pitfalls/strategies people experience in negotiation situations. The theme of this books falls into 4 steps: (1)disentangle people from problems (2)attend to mutual interests that are similar, different, or can be dovetailed. (3)invent as many options as possible (brainstorm)(4) find objective criteria (usually the principle of fairness, a third party, law, or regulations).   This book makes sense in a theoretical way, the perfect \\"strategy\\" might be compromised by reality and pressure. However, it is a good starting point for the starters and a reflecting point for the experienced.   Finally, this book points out that only by doing/practicing can any negotiator grow professionally.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Wow. If you haven't seen this movie yet, stop reading this review and go watch it in theaters! This movie is fantastic, it really makes me wish I had mutant powers. Honestly, besides Harry potter 7 part 2, this is my favorite movie of 2011 as of August 1st 2011. The storyline, drama, dialogue, and acting is superb. DEFINITELY better than X-men 3 the last stand. It is nice to see Professor X and magneto in their younger years. They are portrayed awesomely by James Mcvoy (Mr. Tumnus from Narnia) and Michael Fassbender (Lt. Archie Hicox from Inglorious Basterds). My favorite character in this movie was Mystique though, I'm being bias here because I'm a HUGE Jennifer Lawrence fan. The relationship between charles (professor x) and raven (mystique) made the movie for me, and those moments when charles and eric (magneto) bond, too. I'm a 13 year old boy so I could be being a little bias over this comic book movie, but that doesn't take away the fact that this movie is AWESOME. It's action packed and its funny in some parts too! I will definitely be ordering/buying the blu-ray copy of this film, and if it were necessary for me to buy multiple copies for some reason, I'D DO IT IN A HEART BEAT. WELL DONE MATTHEW VAUGHN. SPECTACULAR.
B0033AI41G|2.0|Having read the book, I was quite disappointed with this movie.  Sure, the movie is gripping because the story is tragically sad and the acting is pretty good.  In this sense, the movie does a good of job highlighting the impact of serious mental illness and the need to help those who are dealing with it.  But the problem is that the movie is about a real person, and comparison with the book (which I trust) shows that the movie left out and changed so many key elements that it represents an unacceptable distortion of the truth of John Nash's life.  I could go into detail by giving many examples, but instead I urge you to simply read the book (or listen to the audiobook).  The true story is far more powerful and interesting than this ridiculously popularized movie.
B0054DFIGY|5.0|Pretty cool how they put this together. The packaging the imagery. If you have an interest in string instruments pretty much gives you the 101 on playing a Uke. A song book for the album. Tab, notes and full sheet music to each track. A song/ lyrics  book with images. Well taken imagery that is very fitting to the music on the album. And the music very cool! Y[[ASIN:B004V6MWFU Ukulele Songs]]ou like it.
B00136JS12|5.0|arguably one of the best albums of all time.  A masterpiece of an album.  Better than most greatest hits albums of other artists.
0763644765|4.0|This is the best potty book I've seen.  It's still not perfect though.  I think the baby should look more like a kid so that the child that you are potty training thinks that kids go on the potty, not babies.  I agree with showing the diaper in the beginning though.  I like that they show it takes awhile to go, but I think they overdid it, and my daughter wonders why the baby, dog and cat are sleeping on the potty.  But, they actually show the baby sitting on the potty which is a plus.  The Potty Time with Elmo book is HORRIBLE.  Elmo isn't the one training, his doll is, which makes no sense.  No one is shown sitting on the potty.  The only thing that book has going for it is the sounds, but I think the kid just likes to push the buttons to hear the sounds, not learn about how to use the potty.  So, back to this book, it's the best potty book I've read, so I would recommend it.
B001KX50BK|5.0|Yes this is the original theatrical version. For anyone who simply wants to know if this is the original theatrical version, like myself--The BluRay version is the original theatrical version.[[ASIN:B001KX50BK Pretty Woman [Blu-ray]]]
B004EPYZSK|4.0|When I was growing up in the 60's and 70's, I never understood why Dad liked westerns so much: They moved too sinkin' slow with characters whose motives were absurdly simple or lethargically opaque and with randomly peppered \\"action.\\" Action, right --a couple of guns fire-- Oh boy, that's exciting. . .but Dad also loved Kubrick's 2001. . .    I, on the other hand, was mesmerized by Star Wars' aesthetic (excepting the horribly edited Return Of The Jedi, the first misstep), and entranced by Ridley Scott's exceptional and visually arresting Alien. That was my time and represented my sensibilities on film. Westerns? Please.    Now I'm in my early 50's and I've only recently re-discovered Eastwood's not-edited-for-60's-TV spaghetti westerns. Yes, I think I now understand why Dad so enjoyed those movies with their alternating boldness and slinking subtlety. It has something to do with the appeal of shedding modern-age trappings in favor of the simplicity that a good horse and a reliable six-shooter can provide. Still, I'm entertained by the SciFi fantasies of Robocop and District 9, too.     One dimensional characters that gain substance as the movie progresses, remembrance of love and glancing hints of what might be, a grand moment of thwarted alien retribution, but more than anything it's the overall tone of the film that binds it together, and with great satisfaction. Part Unforgiven and part Starship Troopers, this is absolutely fun stuff. Dad would have loved this film and also would have anticipated its DVD release.    In the meantime, I think I'll pull my copies of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and 2001: A Space Odyssey for another viewing.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|This is a great CD - I never knew I liked Pink until I realized some of my favorite songs were hers.  Who knew?  Received quickly and as described.

0553801473|2.0|Over 5000 pages and no end in sight.  This was supposed to wrap up the saga, but it looks like another 5000 pages before we're done.  I was looking forward to closure but was sorely disappointed.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Really a nice knife for a rock bottom price.  It is similiar but not the same as the Schrade SCHF3N.  This knife is a full tang, 1/4\\" blade with rubber type handle scales that are fastened with allen head type screws.  The handle has a real attractive pattern on the scales and has a non-slippery feel.  The overall quality of the knife equals that of knives I have that cost many, many times more.  The sheath however sucks.  It is flimsy nylon with a plastic insert for the blade.  The retaining strap will hardly snap around the handle and the snap is weak; I would not trust the sheath worn on the belt.  I think this knife would benefit greatly from a quality custom sheath.  Overall, this is a real sleeper deal on a heavy duty knife that looks great.

B004Y1USJE|3.0|This is no Close to the Edge, it is no Magnification (where Yes got it back together), it is no Talk.  The album is definitely not definable by any other Yes album, not even Drama.  I don't get the Drama comparisons at all (except for Madman at the Screens).  Drama had energy and a useful bass, unlike this album.  It Can Happen, Machine Messiah, Tempus Fugit were rocking songs.  You can't rock to this album (it is overly subdued).  Fly From Here belongs to its own genre for Yes, if it can even be considered a Yes album.  It sounds more like an album called Fly From Here, \\"a compilation created by former members of Yes\\".      The Fly From Here suite wasn't a 20+ minute piece of music as the transitions between the pieces were non-existent.  There is the overture, the main 6 minute piece, a good following song, then fluff.  That was a major disappointment as a 20+ minute piece needs to be able to carry an album.  Downes' \\"Bumpy Ride\\" sounds so corny and very much like a bumpy ride on a carousel or a kiddy ride at an amusement park, no edge at all.  The We Can Fly From Here and Sad Night at the Airfield portions of the \\"epic\\" were good, but the remainder, the drums subdued, the bass a little too strong/not very riffy, the keyboards too childish/toyish/lacking of any edge.  The Overture and reprise seem like filler.      David Benoit seems to have been terribly underutilized on this album, though his voice was really good when it is used.  The whole point of Yes continuing needs to be incorporation of the next generation, especially if they are going to use replacements.  I found it unfortunate to find out Downes and Horn being larger players, using old discarded material instead of using Wakeman and Benoit to create a new wave of input for the sound.  I really feel for Benoit, having a target on him from some Yes \\"fans\\" that won't accept him.  Benoit has a great voice which I think wasn't allowed nearly the amount of time it deserves on this album.  Sure, he isn't JonAnderson, but he isn't trying to be.      For the rest of the album, Into the Storm seemed to capture some sound of Yes, but it is fleeting.  Howe is good, but even his stuff isn't exactly the focus of the engineering.  I think Horn did a terrible job piecing this together.  It focuses too much on Downes' toyish keyboard playing (he plays notes and there are gaps between the notes with absolutely no atmosphere between them), has little focus of edge from Howe or White, and too much of Squire's bass in the foreground.      I'm glad others are finding more enjoyment out of this album, though 5 of 5 stars is a ridiculous rating for this album, this is not Close to the Edge.  I hope to enjoy the album more listening to it on subsequent listenings, but I don't expect to.  I'd say the album has grown on me at some parts, so it is about 3.25 to 3.5 of 5.

B0041T52S6|4.0|22-year-old Canadian slacker Scott Pilgrim faces ridicule from his friends and bandmates when he hooks up with 17-year-old high-schooler Knives Chau. However, his life becomes infinitely more complicated when he dumps Chau for enigmatically cool American girl Ramona Flowers. Flowers' seven 'evil exes' have decided that Scott must defeat them all in order to date Ramona. Scott is forced into seven battles of escalating difficulty as he tries to win Ramona's heart and make amends for his rough treatment of Chau.    Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is an interesting film. It's a full-scale, all-out assault on the viewer's sensibilities, with radical shifts of tone and pace as the film moves from what appears to be a grounded comedy with some geeky overtones to a flat-out fantastical cartoon-made-flesh, with characters levitating through the air and unleashing 'demon hipster chicks' in battle, before shifting back to an intense relationship drama for five minutes before side-shifting into a bloodless Tarantino movie. In many ways cool, but it makes for an at times uneven film.    The movie is directed by Edgar Wright, who previously helmed the flicks Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and the TV series Spaced. This film marks his first major work without the partnership of Simon Pegg (who was writing and filming Paul at the same time; Pegg and Wright will apparently be soon reconvening for a third film). The film also marks Wright's first work with an American-sized movie budget: Scott Pilgrim cost ten times as much as Hot Fuzz and twenty times as much as Shaun of the Dead to make and every cent of it can be seen on screen. The visuals in the movie are kinetic, explosive and rich (multiple viewings may be required to take everything in), though never too confusing. The fight scenes are pretty good, and the choreography makes you believe that Michael Cera could kick some backside, which is an impressive achievement. As an action movie - the American Kung Fu Hustle is a comparisonI've seen made - it works very well.    As a relationship drama/comedy it's more varied. It's not helped that central character Scott Pilgrim is rather unlikable. I know that's the point of both comic and film, but he doesn't really improve and become more likable over the course of the film, at least not until the last few seconds of the movie. Michael Cera is also pretty much just Michael Cera in the film, only really springing to life during the battles (particularly the bass battle, when he brings the required attitude) and the rest of the time doing his whiny indie actor spiel, which risks becoming tiresome. In a film full of villains exploding into coins, music-summoned CGI dragons and people reincarnating after using an 'extra life', the most fantastical thing is that any of these women would find Pilgrim even remotely attractive.    Luckily, the rest of the cast is almost flawlessly excellent. Kieran Culkin is superb as Pilgrim's 'cool gay flatmate' who acts as his moral compass, whilst Anna Pill is suitably demented as drummer Kim (whose band introductions are among the funnier things in the film). Ellen Wong and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are both great as Scott's love interests Knives Chau and Ramona Flowers. Winstead hits the note that Cera fails to by successfully portraying a sympathetic character despite her many bad decisions and judgment calls.    The film also has a few nice ironic cameo appearances. Brandon Routh (the ex-Superman) and Chris Evans (Captain America/the Human Torch) play two of Ramona's evil exes, a rival bassist with psi-powers gained through veganism and a skateboarder-turned-action-movie-star. Both actors take the mickey out of their tough guy roles with excellent comic timing, not to mention Wright reusing the Spaced approach of getting characters to do things they don't want to by using the magic phrase, \\"There's girls watching\\".    Once you get past the great performances (a variable lead aside) and startling visuals, the movie is effectively a metaphor for characters having to confront the demons of their past and not let bad history restrict the potential for happiness in the future. Or something along those lines. It's also a crazy action flick with tons of excellent geek references which will appeal to those who know what Scott Pilgrim is talking about when he references the bassline to the theme tune for Final Fantasy II (which I believe is actually Final Fantasy V, but given a different number due to...sorry, getting off-topic there) and where the beautiful 'L word' is 'lesbian'.    Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (****) goes on a little too long and towards the end becomes repetitive (I think it might have worked better with five evil exes), and Wright's visual brilliance becomes a little over-manic when not restrained by a stronger writing partner like Simon Pegg, but overall this is a fun and frantic movie with strong performances and an offbeat sense of humour.
B000A0GYD2|4.0|Surprisingly I actually used this series to understand Space Systems and Design for my masters. This was quite comprehensive and allowed me to put things in perspective. I would recommend this to all Aerospace Engineers or anyone working in the Space environment.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|First off....Susan could fart in the mic and it would be more soulful than many out there. Derek is a genius on the slide, bass player is very good. And the addition of the smooth/old school clavinet playing on \\"Midnight in Harlem\\" adds a laid back groove. All in all....GREAT album!
0783219695|5.0|I found this series to be very comprehensive of what we see in the actual space industry. I work as a defense contractor for NASA and can give my approval that this helped me understand more thing than college could teach me! It's very educational and pretty neat information for a space nerd ;)
0756404738|4.0|I did not like this book as well as the first, but it's still quite a saga indeed.  It's fantasy after all, so one should expect all this \\"strange\\" activity going on.  No explanation necessary.   One must suspend belief of the known for these travels.
B0022WCZRK|5.0|Give me a break, folks! Most important album in last 20 years. Gorgeous in every way. Go take your backlash and write it in several of the Eagles albums instead of here.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|since the most recent updates i&apos;ve run into and issue where the delete key does not work. Instead it just duplicates the last word over and over again and then crashes the keyboard. I&apos;m also getting? more crashes since the last update.
B001DJ7PNW|5.0|I'm not going to review the movie. At this point there's not much that can be said about it that hasn't already been said. I'll just say that I find it very compelling and some of the bonus features on the disc seem to add to the credibility of Jim Garrison's argument.  The Blu-ray book isn't a whole lot a material, but it's nicely done and does have some interesting information in it. In my opinion it was worth it to go this rout instead of just the basic dvd or blue-ray, it just adds to the overall package.
044024238X|5.0|Just completed the audio version of \\"The Undomestic Goddess\\" a few days ago and was prompted to write a few words. I am an avid fan of Sophie's lovely work, upbeat stories, the spirit of her characters and the whole plot. I loved this story. This the 1st time I heard Sophie' work read on an audio CD and the narrator did an excellent job in giving life to Sophie's characters. Samantha Sweety's and Trish's conversation was always engaging and sweet. The drama, the plot and the storyline kept the interest alive till the end of the story.     The story about how a hardworking and bright young woman, Samantha Sweety, made her way into a competitive lawfirm, the aftermath of client's case that led to a difficult situation for Samantha, and how she dealt with them was indeed interesting, engrossing and inspiring as it gave a positive message to many bright and hardworking young professional women. Since Samantha was a high achiever, she got turned off by the work fiascos and decided to take a break in the outskirts of London and got into a housekeeper's role. That make-belief role gave her food for thought on how to tackle her real work challenges and how to understand the games that were played by a key partner, her ally, at her lawfirm. That ally turned out to be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Another handsome colleague that Samantha was drawn towards turned out to be more of a control freak who tried to define her life for herself vs. respecting her drift towards life. Despite that, Samantha was fortunate to have come across both kind and caring individuals along the way so she never gave up on hope and persistence.     Samantha Sweety 's constant tussle between personal life vs. professional obligations always brought a smile to my face. The story's plot seemed very close to many real life scenarios where young professional women have to make a compromise or I should say prioritize what really matters the most at certain stage of their life....Samantha's vulnerability kicks-in many times, but then her courage to stand-up for her self served as a major breakthrough...      The ending was as beautiful as the journey through Samantha's life in London and its outskirts.     Overall a great story! I would hope Hollywood would care to take the plot and story and make an inspiring movie out of it.   It would be lovely to see either Rene Zellweger or Cameron Diaz or Amy Adams play Samantha Sweety...No Isla Fischer this time, please. Loved her in the Confessions, though.    Hoping for the best to come out of this inspiring, lovely and sweet story.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|Why does this app need so many permissions? I could be wrong, but an alarm needs acess to the time and thats about it... Why the internet and especially my contacts and personal info?
B004LWZW24|4.0|How could you describe Insidious? The best words would be scary and fun. This movie is one of the scariest movies I've seen. It has everything a horror movie should have. Jump scenes, scary villains, a great plot ect. It's fun to watch with friends or by yourself in the dark. I can gurantee you will jump at at least one scene in this movie. Also, this movie has very good acting (something rare in a lot of horror movies). You can actually relate to the characters. The only complaint is after two views, it starts to lose it's greatness (it still is good though). In the end, this is a great movie that you should most definatly check out.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Somewhere in the New Mexico desert of the 1870's, a man wakes up, wounded, unarmed except for a strange metal bracelet, and with no memory of how he got there.  Shortly thereafter, the man makes short work of three bounty hunters.  He moves on to the small cattle town of Absolution, looking for answers and finding only trouble.  The local sheriff arrests him as Jake Lonergan, thief, murderer, and gang leader.  When the aliens show up and start kidnapping people, Jake finds out what the bracelet is for...<br /><br />\\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" is a unique mixture of western and science fiction.  Thanks to some excellent casting and good direction, it delivers a highly entertaining movie; you do have to roll with the premise.  Daniel Craig is first rate as Jake, a laconic tough guy with a strong sense of honor and a stronger need to find a missing woman.  Olivia Wilde is excellent as Ella, the mysterious woman who dogs Jake's footsteps and who claims to be looking for what he lost.  Harrison Ford is gruffly convincing as Colonel Dolarhyde, local cattle baron and Civil War veteran, who isn't giving up his son or his spread to anyone from anywhere.  The supporting cast is also quite good, and helps deliver the theme of redemption that ties the movie together.<br /><br />Director Jon Favreau offers lots of well-done action scenes and some excellent special effects.  The movie is tongue in cheek in the right places and the whole thing seems to work; recommended.
B001AIY58O|4.0|For its time, this movie was rather innovative.  If you recall the late 80s and early 90s, most of the action movies of the time assumed that the world would be completely dystopic by the 21st century.  (SEE ALSO Robocop, Predator 2, at least half of the movies made by Schwarzennegger...)    Demolition Man defies this by swinging the pendulum completely the opposite direction and pitting classic action archetypes against each other in a utopic future setting instead of the prosaic dystopic one.    Some disbelief suspension is necessary to enjoy this.  There's plenty of overacting and the whole movie's rather campy.  You'll either love it or hate it.  Most people I've talked to love it.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|My husband and I love this series. The crime scene/police dramas and reality show have become so depressing and predictable that make shows like Weeds,Dexter and Breaking Bad so interesting because life is truly better than fiction and most of the scenarios could really happen cause life can be so twisted!
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|This is an excellent album.  If you are a fan of Deep Purple and/or Led Zeppelin, then you will appreciate this album.  It has that 'classic' sound, but not dated.  Their 2nd CD is even better than this one, by the way.  I've read several reviews of this album and felt like I needed to add an unbiased opinion.  I was shocked to read so many negative reviews of this album, but found a common theme among those...they were Joe B fanboys.  I guess he's some virtuoso, but his fans seem to be upset that he's a band member and not 'the man'.  Get over it!
B005CMSDKA|5.0|I really enjoyed watching movies genre about empowering children (especially girls) in kicking bad guys assess. At least it showed how kids can really kick-butt (although it was only a movie), rather seeing films about them child being abused, exploited etc. The first movie I saw was 'The Professional', where we can see the revengeful Mathilda Lando (twelve years old Natalie Portman's first film debut) trained to be a 'cleaner' by the best hitman in town. In 'Lawn Dogs' Devon Stockard's character (played by eleven years old Mischa Barton) defies her own father in protecting her innocent best friend from being battered to death, Mindy Macready aka the foul-mouthed Hit-Girl in 'Kick-Ass' (a physically demanding character played by the 11 years old Chloe Moretz) and Mattie Ross in 'True Grit' (gaining Hailee Steinfeld an Oscar nomination). Now come Hanna Heller aka `HANNA' (played by the talented Irish rose, Saoirse Ronan), about a trained child assassin going on a mission sent by her father. The movie was being directed by 'Atonement' director, Joe Wright, of Ronan's previous film. With the combination of both actress and director, will sure bring the audience the feeling of how the story will end. I really like Wright's signature of `long take' especially of the Bahnhof rumble and Marissa's flashback scenes. For now, all I can do is to wait for the DVD + combo to be released on the end of this month.
B0043RSIUK|2.0|I loved the \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" series so much that I couldn't wait to buy this book. It was NOT worth the wait. I was hesitant when I read the other reviews because I am not a fan of \\"war books\\", but I convinced myself that it could be as good as the previous series, so I ordered it. What a yawn! What a chore! As some other reviewers mentioned, the characters were cardboard and lifeless, and their stories were predictable and for the most part not very interesting...which is strange, because at the beginning of the book I really connected with the lives of the miners and their misery. But it was as if this was the beginning of a different book, as Mr. Follett jumped from one set of characters to another, and on and on...The only reason I mustered up two stars is because I did learn a little more about WWI than I knew. If this book was a chore to read, Mr. Follett must have found it agonizing to write!!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|As suggested on Child's website I chose to read \\"Killing Floor\\" first in the Reacher series as the site recommends the reader should read the series chronologically. Upon finishing the book and reading other reviews I find it a bit odd that Child/the publisher does this. I found Reacher to be not fully developed (rightfully so in any book one) and not all that likeable. Much like many other reviews, I found many things about this book annoying to the point where I was being a critic and not a reader.The fact that the characters say \\"damn\\" so damn much is what really stuck out to me.Others made mention of how often Reacher shrugs. I actually did not notice that. I also noticed many times where the reader can clearly tell that the author is not an American nor is he familiar with American English, slang and so on. We do not call bathroom stalls \\"cubicles\\" in America for instance. Reachers character flaws stand out more than once.His constant pining over Roscoe is uncharacteristic in my opinion of a man capable of such brutality. Antother instance is when Reacher is jumping and dancing in the street after a victory.    Now to the story. As many others have mentioned, the plot and conincidence is outrageous but that's what made the story fun for me. It reads like a cheesy action film and I've always liked those. The bad guys are incredibly bad and Child does a great job making the reader hate them right along with Reacher.     All in all, I enjoyed it. By no means a work of great skill but still highly enjoyable. That said, if the series was not so popular I probably would not continue reading Child/Reacher based on this first installment. I do intend to read a few more in the series to see how Reacher evolves. I would not recommend beginning with this one.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I waited a long time for this book, but it's the biggest disappointment I've had since the last installment of this aimless, plodding, series.  From the opening pages spent in the POV of a character we've never seen before and don't see again, through long dull chapter after chapter of only the briefest vignettes that do nothing to advance the story, to the bitter flat ending, I simply could not believe that it could possibly be this bad.  I kept waiting for the old George R R Martin to rear his head and tell an actual story.  But no.  Apparently, the old George R R Martin is no more.<br /><br />I'll bet the only people more upset than the readers who've invested in this monumental waste are the execs at HBO who've agreed to another season of the show only to discover that Martin has failed to deliver anything that would sustain the project.<br /><br />Hopefully, the people at Random House have Brandon Sanderson waiting in the wings and will bring him in to rescue this mess without George having to die for the honor.

142311339X|5.0|After reading maximum ride (1-3) and then having it get screwed up for the need to add unnecessary books, i was a little worried for this book. I thought this was just RR trying to milk his already successful cashcow even more than he already did. I thought it was gonna be played out and repetitive of the first three books. I was in for a surprise.    The first thing you will notice is that the book feels older. I dont mean that in the characters are older. I mean that in it feels a lot less patronizing than the first book about a 12 year old boy. I felt like i was being taken more seriously as a reader when reading this book.     The book takes a big step and moves from first person to third person from the perspective of 3 brand new characters (Pipers point of view was easily my favorite). The way this book keeps you guessing is astounding. Throughout the whole book i felt myself trying to guess at the amnesiac, Jason's past, none of which were even close to the actual ending.    I found it refreshing seeing the world from the point of view from children of gods who werent the big 3. It no longer felt like the main characters were over powered with their powers.     The ending of this book sent me scrambling to find out when the next book comes out, and let me tell you, it cant come out soon enough. This book left me wanting more than the other books in the series and i can honestly say that the series has taken a step up and \\"The Lost Hero\\" is easily my most favorite in the series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this. I had it before on my phone before it needed a complete wipe and had forfotten about it until recently. It is a much gentler way to wake up. Instead of jumping awake at the obnoxious built in alarm this sort of grabs your attention first and then you wake up.  I love that snooze is a math problem if you set it that way because usually I&apos;m awake after having to figure the hard ones out in my half awake head. Which means I&apos;m out of bed and not cutting my morning time so short I might be late.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I've had my 405CX about 2 years now.  I love it!  And so do my friends that I've let borrow it.  The heart rate monitor is great!  It's not only for runs too!  I've used it for P90X inside my house and other workouts at the gym.  At the gym I like that I can use it to make sure my heart rate is up when I'm doing circuit workouts and to keep track of how long I'm resting between sets. For normal runs I've had no problem finding satellites.  Rain and sweat have also not been a problem for me with operating the unit.  I'm a heavy sweater too.  I've used it in the winter with gloves on and there's been no problem there as well.  I don't know if I'm lucky or what, but I can't complain.    The only con with this is that you can't power it off.  I debated giving it 4/4.5 stars, but decided against it because in the past 2 years I've only ran completely out of power with the device once.  Plus I knew before buying it that it had to be charged.  The newer models have a power off switch that I may upgrade if I get into running very very heavily.  Right now I run 3 - 4 times a week and at most I'll run 10 - 15 miles.  With my weight workouts I think I use it quite often and it still looks like I just took it out the box.    Great product.  Love Garmin!  Highly recommend it.
1435122968|3.0|It seemed like a very good deal in the store at $20, but if you want to be swept away to fantastic realms, DON'T buy this edition! No sooner do I begin to really get into a story than I'm rudely jerked back to reality by extremely obvious and irritating typos, misspellings, and grammar errors! The entire book is rife with glaring mistakes that should have been caught by any semi-competent proofreader. It really diminishes the quality of one's reading experience. What's more, the (very lovely) binding is regrettably pretty shoddily made. I've only owned this book for a few weeks, and the other day the thin layer of photographic foil on the front began spontaneously to peel and flake off! I find it distressing that such a pretty cover should start deteriorating so fast. Also, it is definitely not leather. Which is completely fine; I don't require my reading material to be wrapped in dead cow, but they should probably be clearer in their product description since they do say \\"leather.\\"  Do go and buy some other Lovecraft collection, because the stories are wonderful, but if typos and misspellings bad enough to actually change the meaning of sentences (e.g. snakes \\"writing\\" instead of \\"writhing\\") are going to disturb your reading experience, THIS IS NOT THE ONE FOR YOU.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Have been very pleased with the Zoom H4n.  It has many modes of operation and every time some unique situation comes up for me to record, The Zoom has a mode that fits.  Quality of sound is excellent (low noise) and the easy setup allows me to have non-technical people setup and use.      I use it in conjunction with a UHF wireless mic setup and the compact nature of both units makes it great for traveling.
0385341008|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites.  I just finished reading it for the third time and was really sad when it ended.  Its the kind of book you want to go on forever.  Its a new tradition for me to read this book at least once a year.  I found such a love for the people in this book and I can't say enough good about it.  Before reading this, I had not known that the Channel Islands suffered so greatly during World War II.  If you want a great book you won't want to put down, read Guernsey.  LOVE IT.
B005DC68NI|5.0|The author begins with a solid list of reasons why self-publishing is here to stay and why those involved in print media, including agents, editors, and booksellers, will need to adapt or be left behind in this rapidly changing market. Gaughran also outlines the process of self-pubbing from the importance of creating a marketable cover to editing your manuscript before production. This book also has excellent marketing and promotional advice for the already pubbed Kindler. I loved reading the many personal accounts from authors who've found success through self-pubbing. I hope every author who is planning on publishing, or who has already published, heeds Gaughran's sage advice.

B003QNXPUK|2.0|I really wanted to like my Invisible Shield, I liked having my iPhone \\"naked\\" but after 4 months, the back protector lost its grip at the back top left corner by the camera.  After a week or so of trying to stick it back down, I finally pulled it off.  The front and side \\"shields\\" are holding on so I'm probably going to just replace the back for now.  I think one issue might be if you lay it down on a really smooth surface (like a granite counter top), the \\"shield\\" has a bit of a suction action and will stick to the surface and pull off the phone.
B000X418UE|2.0|\\"I make movies for 15-year-old boys? What a crime!\\" -Michael Bay<br /><br />You know what, Mike? I was 15 when I saw this movie back in the summer of 1996 and I wasn't too impressed, so maybe you ought to take back that ludicrous comment. As a matter of fact I went to see it twice (June and July 1996), just to make sure my judgement was honest and correct.<br /><br />Since debuting with Bad Boys in 1995, Bay has averaged about one movie every two years. But I think that it's quite sad and pathetic that in 16 years and nine movies he has not matured as a filmmaker in the slightest. If anything he's regressed.<br /><br />The Rock has characters with just a touch more depth than we're used to in Bay films. It's not necessarily a big story but he seems to stretch it out over two hours with heinously over-cut action scenes and extraneous sub-plotting.<br /><br />General Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) takes over Alcatraz with some poisonous gas rockets and aims them at San Francisco with the intention of vaporising everyone unless the families of each member of his dead team is paid $1,000,000. A nerdy and heavily bored FBI agent, named Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), is called to San Francisco from Washington to observe and instruct the inevitable SEAL operation to overthrow the Marines on Alcatraz. But wait, there's more. Alcatraz is a maze of twisted metal and broken walls. They won't stand a chance without someone who has knowledge of how to break out. Or break in.<br /><br />And so enters the philosophizing and lanky-haired John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) at about 45 minutes into the movie. He's been in jail for 30 years and doesn't appear to be annoyed at having to work for the very people who have held him without trial for so long. There is an utterly pointless and indulgent car chase before he actually gets down to business.<br /><br />Once on the island, the SEALS, as predicted, are crap and get killed instantly. So, basically, Hummel wants to honor his fallen comrades by killing more American soldiers. How absurd, but not much in this film makes sense. Plus these SEALS have thoroughly extensive training and, in real life, there is NO WAY they'd end up being so useless.<br /><br />Goodspeed and Mason are not a great pairing. I don't know what the deal is with Nic Cage, when he's good he's great, but more often than not he's so unbelievably awful I wonder how he manages to get work. Goodspeed isn't very appealling. He's annoying, not funny, and little of his dialogue sounds natural coming from his mouth. When he tries to be tough, he just seems ridiculous. Mason is just an old James Bond. Hell, he's even a British Secret Agent. The role was written with Connery in mind, so don't expect anything but his elite brand of OAP smart-ass cool.<br /><br />Coherent editing is not this movie's strength. In fact, coherence is hardly something one would associate with The Rock. There are so many distractions and superfluous plot points that the only way Bay can compensate is to turn every scene into a epileptic blur. The target audience is familiar with this kind of film-making anyway, and it has sadly become the accepted norm for action movies.<br /><br />The Rock is inferior and less engaging than a similar movie that came out the month before its release. Executive Decision attempts the same theme and an identical form of tension. In 135 minutes, it wastes no time on sub-plotting, develops far more likable characters and is way more exciting.<br /><br />Exec Dec is played straight. The Rock is played to look cool and hip. It's not. And apart from Zimmer's entertaining score, there's not much to recommend. This rock could have skipped along the surface, but merely sinks to the bottom under its over-written, over-wrought, over-directed weight.<br /><br />Oh, and if Mason is supposed to have a major beef with Womack then perhaps they should have cast someone older than John Spencer who would have been 19/20-years-old when his character first crossed Mason.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks great in 2.35:1 1080p with LCPM 5.1 sound. A fair amount of extras are included.und. A fair amount of extras are included.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|Fits my Verizon IPhone 4 perfectly and totally protects back and sides.  The protective front cover is less successful, scratching easily, but that is the nature of these covers.  Smoke color complements the phone itself.
B0018GRAE4|5.0|This is a fantastic album. Very good music, just because it is hard rock doesn't mean it isn't well made. Five Finger Death Punch's two albums are both very good, which is hard to find in this generation because so many artists can only make one or two solid songs so nobody bothers ever buying entire albums. FFDP definitely knows how to put out an album and is definitely worth buying!
0316044695|5.0|This is a book every red-blooded American should read!  Marcus Luttrells heroic story defies belief. I was captivated with every page of this book.  You will laugh, you will cry (most of my pages are tear soaked!) and you will finish this book being  So very grateful for the courage, strength & resiliency of our young men bravely fighting for America.  I kissed the ground when I finished reading Marcus's story, but I would have loved to have  Hugged him too! He's truly an unbelievable American.
0792833201|5.0|The title says it all. This is a great no-frills DVD of a great movie worth seeing again and again that arrived much earlier than estimated. Buy from Frugal City. My business with them was quite satisfactory.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I love the Garmin Forerunner I ordered from Amazon. The feature to instantly upload the run data into the computer is amazing. I love being able to track my results, set goals, and analyze my runs. This has taken my training to the next level.

B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Revelator is more than I expected it to be. The second time listening to it, really told me this was one of the best albums I've ever heard. Derek is phenomenal on the guitar and Susan's voice is outstanding. The band overall is excellent and highly recommend this CD to everyone. Midnight in Harlem, Bound for Glory, Ball and Chain, and These Walls are terrific.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|This definitely the best home video release of STAR TREK: THE ORIGINAL SERIES that you'll ever find, but It's still somewhat flawed as it drops several extras from the past home video incarnations. Having said that, this far superior to any other version, it is great to have both the original and enhanced shows together, and I never dreamed the original series could look and sound so good. Even if the missing extras prevent perfection it is still most own for fans and Blu-Ray owners.

Henrietta, her family, her town, her era comes to lives. The book is not about science - ONLY, it is about how we undoubtedly are all connected to science. This is a book to read by bites, putting it aside to think, reflect and paused, and then continue.<br /><br />I tend to think about what would I do?  an African American girl once told me: No, you can't know how I feel because you haven't lived my life. and that thought resonated throughout the book.

B00127RAJY|3.0|I've been doing 30 Day Shred for about 2 weeks now.  (Just an FYI for perspective's sake - I am in pretty good shape, can jog a decent 5k, and I try to work out regularly.  Basically, just a person who tries to stay in shape.)      Pros:  Despite its simplicity, I get a really good sweat and a good overall workout each time I do this video, and this keeps me coming back each day.  My shoulders, chest and arms get worked pretty well (like many women, I have great lower body strength and limited upper body), and I can imagine having fairly toned arms in the the next few weeks.  The moves are simple and easy to follow, so you don't have to be super coordinated or super fit to keep up.  Jillian does offer safety tips for newbies.  There are 3 different workouts so you don't get stuck with the same old routine for too long.  It's just over 20 minutes long - easy to fit into a busy schedule.  No need for extra equipment - just a few hand weights, maybe a mat if you're on a hard floor.    Cons:  Some may find this workout too boring, not enough \\"excitement\\", no new moves or great variety to keep things interesting.  (Basic moves include jumping jacks, push ups, various ab crunches, simple plyo moves, and squats or lunges.)  There are a lot of squats and lunges so if your knees are weak, injured, etc, then this isn't for you.  There are only about 2 minutes of stretching and cooling down at the end, so you may want to do some stretching on your own after the video is over.  If you've got really great abs, you may find some of the ab work too easy for you so modify as you see fit.    **PS - Start the video and THEN gather your equipment while the video runs - you can't fastforward to the main menu, so the random chit chat and misc. info has to play out before you can get to the main menu and select your workout.

B000OCXFCO|4.0|Following the release of 1999's \\"Risk\\" and 2001's \\"The World Needs A Hero\\" (both of which were frowned upon by many-a-fan, even if this reviewer is not one of them), Megadeth briefly dissolved before eventually allowing a long-overdue return to form (called \\"The System Has Failed\\")  to see the light of day in late 2004. This comeback was such a good one that some might have thought that Dave Mustaine & Co. should have just decided to play it safe and break-up again so that they could guarantee going out on a high-note. Well, did they? Oh, no. Quite the opposite, in fact. Instead, just marked a stepping stone with which the band would continue to grow on and build off of in subsequent years.  Even though they already had the undivided attention of metalheads everywhere, `Deth spent an understandably substantial amount of time on the road. But rest assured, by kicking out a follow-up in \\"United Abominations\\" in 2007, they rocketed back onto the scene with all guns blazing. All of the band's usual goodies -- tasty, meaty, inventive speed metal riffing, superb solos, strong, double-barreled leads, solid, thumping drums, steady, flowing bass lines, typically aggressive tempos, muscular grooves, catchy rhythms, distinctly Megadeth-ian vocals, powerful choruses, etc. - are prevalent as ever, here. Thus, this release is every bit as inspired, thrashy, heavy, aggressive, and consistent as its predecessor. And even though that 2004 release does have the slightly favored edge, this one does make a few minor improvements. For example, the musicianship, is a touch more natural and live-sounding this time around, thus making the songs quite a bit more believable and natural (and less-touched-up by Pro-Tools). But more importantly, listeners are sure to notice that it features many (i.e. at least ten-times-as-many) immediately noticeable hooks. So, this is far-and-away the catchier and more accessible and animated album of the two.<br /><br />\\"Sleepwalker\\" is but one example of how Megadeth can craft an aggressive and fairly blistering thrasher with strong hooks. After beginning with a brief acoustic intro, it soon locks into a propulsive thrash groove. And its hooky, galloping rhythm evokes the \\"Rust In Peace\\" days. This strong opener is also filled with muscle-bound rhythms and really great riffs. The song ends, but not before guitarists trade off fiery solos with each other - each axeman gets and equal amount of time to let one rip. The very inspiring and politically peeved-off \\"Washington Is Next\\" boasts some nice melodic lead work and decent, pronounced, grumbling bass lines. But the real highlight is its inclusion of six (!) positively wailing solos. Following this, the violently-themed \\"Never Walk Alone: A Call To Arms\\" offsets some of the record's best, strongest, and most fiery thrash riffage with a bit of cool, memorable backing guitar harmonies. up on that angry note, \\"United Abominations\\" (the  song) plays like a livid (and at times nearly foaming-at-the-mouth-worthy) rant against the U.N., thanks to its use of angsty (and at times nearly foaming at the mouth-worthy) growls and weird political samples. And an abundance of suitably mean, punching,  heavily crunching, power chords go along with it. It does make room for other (and more pleasant) things, though, like some melodic lead work, keyboards, spoken-word muttering, and (most importantly) a fantastic, wailing and beautifully clean guitar solo that tops anything heard on the past three Megadeth outings.<br /><br />After the restrained, industrial-strength (albeit if fairly interchangeably unremarkable) chugger that is track five, \\"Gears Of War,\\" the remaining songs seem mostly intent on hammering home its political inspiration. (This most certainly conceptual; but it might be easy to overlook because there were more than a few of those in 2007. For proof, see Machine Head's \\"The Blackening,\\" Ozzy Osbourne's \\"Black Rain,\\" Job For A Cowboy's \\"Genesis,\\" Serj Tankian's \\"Elect TheDead,\\" and Nine Inch Nails' \\"Year Zero.\\") Despite having a handful of fairly ripping solos, \\"Blessed Be The Dead\\" is most notable for its subject matter. (Take a minute to read its darkly foreboding and clever lyrical message.) A while later comes \\"Amerikhastan.\\" It may have plenty more screaming solo work, but it is ultimately kind of lost as a result of being placed in between \\"A Tout Le Monde (Set Me Free\\" and \\"You're Dead.\\" The first of these two tracks is a cover/rerecording of a tune of the same name (which originally appeared on Megadeth's \\"Youthanasia\\" in 1994) and it has a strong political bent. And how about that great cameo from Christina Scabbia? The frontwoman briefly vacations from Italy's Lacuna Coil to contribute some effectively textured, harmonic singing that works really effectively and is a perfect fit to the rest of the surrounding music. However, on the downside, \\"A Tout\\" is unfortunately also home to Dave taking his political tirades a bit too far. It is a cluttered and convoluted mess of dark voices, peculiar samples, and robotic-esque noise. But all is well that ends well - \\"Burnt Ice\\" features a lengthy, sustained infectiously clean, noodling solo section that is sure to make air-guitar fingers everywhere itch.<br /><br />Lastly of note is \\"Prey For Blood\\" (not to be mistaken for a Lamb Of God cover!), which may be only four minutes long, but is still a friggin' epic (and a half)! Clearly making a concerted effort to temporarily shift all inspiration into instrumental form, Dave, in a refreshing change of pace, takes out all of their bottled-up anger and frustration on his fretboards, here. After peeling out of the starting gate at blazing, old-school thrash-worthy speeds, the remainder of the tune just oozes with stellar guitar shredding. Mustaine and Glen Drover uncork one excellent, high-flying, nimble-fingered, fiery and fast (yet-simultaneously-melodic and technical), and immediately memorable solo after another. and very memorable solo after another. There are thirteen (yes, you read that right...thirteen!) guitar solos included in all, here. (Eat your heart out, \\"Hangar 13\\"!)

1407109375|4.0|Not the ending I would have liked, but it was still good.  Can't wait for the movie to come out!
B000005HLV|5.0|1994 was a huge year for heavy metal music, and -- thanks due to the release of \\"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\\" in May of '94 -- it also marked a truly historic year on the black metal timeline. With this, their sophomoric full-length and commercial breakthrough, Mayhem graduated from being a potential-filled young talent to being a genuinely great band, gods amongst the Norwegian music circuit, and an active participant in black metal's elite. There is absolutely without question as to if this album ranks in the top five of said genre's best, biggest, heaviest, and most vital, original, groundbreaking, and memorable of all-time. It was enormously influential, too -- so much so, that it is even comparable to fellow seminal black metal releases such as \\"Welcome To Hel\\" and \\"To Mega Therion.\\" Of course, calling it \\"influential\\" may be a bit misleading, because even though it remains, even to this day, one of the most important heavy metal releases in history, few have ever dared to imitate it. See, the majority of bands that have cropped-up in the latter half of the Nineties and early part of the new millennium are relatively melodic and progressive. It all started when the likes of, say, Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir, started incorporating accessible elements like catchy groove, keyboards, symphonies, choirs, clean backing vocal refrains, etc. And things have mostly become only more experimental since then. Nowadays, some bands have even gone so far as to draw influence from the likes of Iron Maiden, King Crimson, and Yes!<br /><br />So, anybody whose definition of BM is based on what has been flooding the market lately would do well to spend some quality time with Mayhem. \\"De Mysteriis\\" is not only an iconic black metal release -- but also a milestone for heavy/extreme metal, as a whole. Part of its genius comes from possessing a sound so unique that it is somewhat hard to describe. Sure, it is inspired by -- although in no way does it worship -- genre primitives like Celtic Frost, Hellhammer, Bathory, Venom, Burzum, and (to a lesser-extent) Mercyful Fate. But it is quite common for Mayhem to adopt a musical style that has a lot in common with that of early American death metal. As such, there are many heavy Morbid Angel, Necrophagia, Obituary, and Possessed influences present throughout. Furthermore, many of its parts (too many to count) fuse-in strong thrash leanings. (Think in the same vein as Slayer, Sodom, Kreator, Sadus, Dark Angel, and Sepultura.) Finally, a few undeniable traces of Candlemass/Black Sabbath/The Melvins/Crowbar-derived doom metal are occasionally sprinkled into the mix, as well. The end result is 47 minutes of seething rage, blazing speed, and bludgeoning brutality. These nine relentlessly uncompromising cuts thoroughly overflow with nonstop ferocious guitar riffing, piledriving rhythms, vocalist Attila Csihar's evil, visceral, classically blackened rasps, mean and ugly bass lines, and drumming that is just plain skull-crushing. Indeed, like a rocket-propelled tank, Jan Axel Blomberg (a.k.a. Hellhammer, which is a simple yet apt and vividly truthful nickname, even if it is borrowed from the above group of the same moniker.) drives the music forward with a murderous and frenetic blast fest. But even if the drumming is usually not all that imaginative -- pummeling blast beats occupy about 95% of his time -- it is nonetheless extremely excellent, tight, and frequently mind-boggling. And it is packs more-than enough muscle and force to leave a lasting (and favorable impression). Furthermore, it certainly is fast, chaotic, slamming, and impeccable enough to be truly one-of-a-kind. All told, the performance turned in by Hellhammer, here, is more-than-cements his status as one phenomenal -- check that: Legendary -- skinsman.<br /><br />Yes, the music does take a substantial amount of patience...but it is worth it., \\"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\\" is likely to be the kind of effort that, at least initially, leaves the majority of audiences with disappointingly mixed or unfavorable feelings. That having been said, it will begin to more-and-more become apparent (until it has become painfully obvious) that the record as an immensely rewarding (repeat) listen with each and every succeeding time it is spun following the first one. Full appreciation may be a slow and gradual process, but it will eventually reveal itself as the very genius piece of work that it is. (It really will!) Innumerable tempo and rhythm change-ups that flow seamlessly into an epic amount of different places and moods, darkly dense (and, at times, somewhat rich-sounding) layers, really cool and great, juxtaposed textures, foreboding soundscape s, lingering feelings of impending doom, chilling (if only faintly audible) background ambiance, uber-meticulous and multi-faceted arrangements, and relentlessly deft, busy, propulsive, complex, and precise musicianship that goes along with it.<br /><br />Peeling out of the starting gate with enough velocity to leave tire-tracks on one's eardrums, all doors are blown completely off of their hinges as dissonance erupts in a murderously massive snowball of malice and blinding hyper-kinesis. Scorching death metal picking, pounding and downtuned bass lines, confidently slow and retching vocals, and impeccable drumming (including thunderous double bass battery) tear through the speakers throughout opener \\"Funeral Fog.\\" And a few tactful and well-placed rhythm change-ups -- i.e. mid-paced breakdowns and slow(er) guitar lines -- are tossed in here and there, too. However, these inclusions are usually so subtle that they can be easy-to-miss, and might even get kind of hidden amongst the mix. This was a wise decision, because this way things never lose even a split blast beat's worth of momentum. But this opening blast, no matter how strong it may be, is ultimately soon overshadowed by what comes next: \\"Freezing Moon\\" is track number two, and a really friggin' amazing and ingenious one, at that. One should not even be hesitant to say that it is a world-renowned classic! And by spanning well over six whole minutes in length, it has epic ambitions and very great, broad, expansive, and dynamic songwriting. By comparison, then, \\"Cursed In Eternity\\" is almost the polar opposite of its predecessor in that it is a straight-ahead, frills-free, all-conquering, death-tinged thrasher. Smoking, buzzsaw guitar leads, insanely fast black metal blasts, and a strong, flowing, and distorted bass bottom are what bolster it.<br /><br />Then, Mayhem throw another semi-curveball in the form of \\"Pagan Fears,\\" which begins on a surprisingly slow note as a few lightly-picked melodic riffs and a basic, rock/death `n' roll drum beat casually float in. However, this almost immediately snowballs nicely into a white-hot ball of anger and energy. From then on, the name of the game is all booming rhythms, blazing, speaker-shredding picking (Euronymous and Blackthorn combine together to form one long wall-of-scorching noise). And, of course, one must not forget to mention the ton of wicked vocal patterns and devastating drumming -- including tight and cracking thrash beats, stomping and rampaging blasts, (what sounds like) hexa-limbed fills, and spectacular cymbal rides -- that are present throughout \\"Pagan Fears.\\" The tune adheres to a deep and filth-caked bass groove, too, thus giving it a little depth and epic-ness. (Plus, it gets a few extra bonus points for its song title -- after all, it just cannot get any more pure black metal than that!)  Coincidentally enough, the subsequent \\"Life Eternal,\\" begins in almost the exact same manner as its predecessor, the just-mentioned \\"Pagan Fears,\\" in that it also has a restrained and brooding \\"oasis\\" of an intro. But as soon as the bunch of wild, Slayer-ish solos come screaming in, it becomes clear that monstrous brutality is just around the corner. And sure enough, warp-speed blast beaten chaos soon takes over. In addition, theguitar leads are, once again, steamrolling (and again, you don't hear any actual notes -- just one long, dissonant grumble). Lastly of note is Varg Vikernes, who may be a terrible human being (he would later go on to serve time for murder and arson convictions), but is nonetheless a very solid bassist. And Varg's bass is prominent and heavy in the mix, here -- it is heard rumbling up from the bottom-of the mix like an irritated bowel. It all combines together to make \\"Life Eternal\\"'s overall sound similar to anything off of Morbid Angel's debut, 1989's \\"Altars Of Madness.\\"<br /><br />The next couple of tracks find Hellhammer taking over the spotlight. \\"From The Dark Past\\" does feature many interesting twists -- such as frequent and sudden changes in rhythm and tempo, brief slow breakdowns that downshift even to a plodding, crawling pace, positively doomy sections, and even a few pockets of near-silence. And it may boast ample screwy, gnawing licks, solid bass work, and frog-throated, acid-gargling vocals. But this is mostly the drummer's show; and he offers-up one of the absolute godliest percussion performances that heavy metal music has ever documented. It is long on thundering double-time pummel, rhythmically marching rolls, really skilled and bouncy fills, deft, booming floor toms, and speedy, crashing cymbals (among other things). The piece is also highlighted by an excellent and everything-but-the-kitchen-sink drum solo in the beginning. All told, this alone makes Hellhammer easily have a case for being one of metal's all-time greatest; although it is true that the same could also be said about \\"Buried By Time And Dust.\\" Treating his trapkit like an orchestra, the man thrusts the rhythms forward with maximum force, blistering speed, and phenomenal precision. This means that, sure, \\"Buried By Time\\" does bury one's eardrums in mountains of propulsive thrash beats and carnage-inducing blast beats that are equally fast as they are bludgeoning. But possessing such the phenomenal talent that this particular skinsman does involves more than just massive amounts of brute force. Hence, its dexterity is fantastic -- as evidenced by the frequent and abundant use of airtight tom-tom pounding, deftly cracking snares, and extraordinary (and very inventive and pronounced) cymbal riding. (Hellhammer rides his hi-hat like no other, here -- in fact, he kind of evokes a world-champion surfer shredding a tidal wave.)<br /><br />This gradually fades out and into the searing, shredding solos of the title song. Now, there are some actual melodies and harmonies to be heard, here. Consider, for example, the cool, spacey, echoing clean backing vocal refrain in the choruses, for instance. The thing is, they just might be exceedingly hard to dissect, what with all of the demonic deathly growls, wild and flattening riffage and thunderous double bass work (great opening drum solo included)  that surround them. Following this comes the epilogue, the hidden and untitled bonus track. This finds Mayhem clearly opting for a concertedly different approach, seeing how it is a bone-chilling slab of almost pure doom metal. On the downside, some listeners might not know quite what to make of this unsettlingly barren, epic, and atmospheric, Enslaved/Agalloch/\\"Monotheist\\"-era Celtic Frost-esque feel. And while it may not sound nearly-as-extreme as usual, it is nonetheless extremely disgusting, nightmarish, foreboding, skin-crawling, opaque, and memorable. All things considered, there is no better way to conclude/go out than with this perfectly cool, fitting, and memorable concluding composition. Sure thing, is fittingly very dark and disturbing; while, at the same time, daring to be different enough to succeed at standing out, apart from the rest of the material.<br /><br />\\"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\\" is the audio equivalent of a runaway, hormone-injected bull set loose down one of those ill-fated streets of Pamplona, Spain. It is as brutal as black metal gets.But this is equally important to note that it is about as good and rewarding/satisfying as it gets, too. Hence, one will not find much extreme metal -- of any kind, mind you! -- that rates anywhere close to being as essential, important, and memorable as \\"D.M.D.S.\\".guitar leads are, once again, steamrolling (and again, you don't hear any actual notes -- just one long, dissonant grumble).

The thing is, they just might be exceedingly hard to dissect, what with all of the demonic deathly growls, wild and flattening riffage and thunderous double bass work (great opening drum solo included)  that surround them. Following this comes the epilogue, the hidden and untitled bonus track. This finds Mayhem clearly opting for a concertedly different approach, seeing how it is a bone-chilling slab of almost pure doom metal. On the downside, some listeners might not know quite what to make of this unsettlingly barren, epic, and atmospheric, Enslaved/Agalloch/\\"Monotheist\\"-era Celtic Frost-esque feel. And while it may not sound nearly-as-extreme as usual, it is nonetheless extremely disgusting, nightmarish, foreboding, skin-crawling, opaque, and memorable. All things considered, there is no better way to conclude/go out than with this perfectly cool, fitting, and memorable concluding composition. Sure thing, is fittingly very dark and disturbing; while, at the same time, daring to be different enough to succeed at standing out, apart from the rest of the material.<br /><br />\\"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\\" is the audio equivalent of a runaway, hormone-injected bull set loose down one of those ill-fated streets of Pamplona, Spain. It is as brutal as black metal gets.But this is equally important to note that it is about as good and rewarding/satisfying as it gets, too. Hence, one will not find much extreme metal -- of any kind, mind you! -- that rates anywhere close to being as essential, important, and memorable as \\"D.M.D.S.\\".

B000HC2LI0|5.0|I have been rewatching this entire series, episode by episode, and I am completely stunned by how this series, which is about ten years old, matches what is happening to us now.  For example, tonight on real TV, President Obama has announced a compromise deal on the debt ceiling.  Meanwhile, as fate would have it, I am watching an episode in which the White House is trying to get a debt ceiling passed, or else the country will default, and how Republicans try to pull last minute deals.  Whatver you experience now, it's all here.  This is a series with great writing (mostly by Aaron Sorkin) and wonderful ensemble acting.      I highly recommend it.  Without a doubt, one of the greatest TV series that has ever been.  Excellent box set.

030746363X|5.0|There are a lot of naysayers out there about this book, but all I can write about is my experience. At the time of purchasing this book, my left knee had such bad tendonitis that I couldn't play soccer or basketball on a weekly basis. Furthermore, the first year of marriage was good to me, as in 20 lbs. good. That's why I decided to give this book a try.    After a month on the diet, without any exercise, I lost 13 lbs. I also started to gain lean muscle mass without gaining any extra lbs.     A few tips for beginners:    * Start on a Monday so your cheat day will be on a Saturday  * Get the 4-Hour Workbook to help you record all of your measurements, daily diets, and exercises. You won't regret it.  * Patience - it takes a while to get used to all of the protein and not eating stuff that you are used to. Be patient, you'll get accustomed to it.  * Drink lots of water

B00005K9LK|5.0|Judas Priest's eight studio album Screaming For Vengeance took the band to new heights of popularity when it was released back in 1982 and has since come to be regarded as an all time classic record for Heavy Metal.<br /><br />Screaming For Vengeance largely lives up to its reputation, the album is very strong and the performances from the band are exceptional. Guitar solos are on top form, Rob's vocals are varied and dynamic and the drumming is rock solid.<br /><br />The album features many of Priest's well-known tracks, such as `The Hellion/Electric Eye,' `Riding On The Wind,' and `You've Got Another Thing Comin.'<br /><br />Part of the success of this album can be attributed to the variety herein, the material ranges from fast and exciting metal music like the title track, to slower more emotional tracks like `(Take These) Chains,' and mixes songs with a more classic rock sound with those with a more 80s metal feel. No two songs sound alike, nothing feels like filler and this is a large contributing factor as to why Screaming For Vengeance is such a good record.<br /><br />If you like Judas Priest, Screaming For Vengeance is obviously something you'll want to pick up and if you are a prospective fan then it would make a fine place to start.

B0000630BT|5.0|Judas Priest's Painkiller album was released in 1990 and has since went on to become a classic album, hugely respected and often included in lists of `best-ever-metal-albums.'<br /><br />For a Judas Priest record, Painkiller is very fast and heavy. Drummer Scott Travis brought a new injection of energy to the band and the material is very hard, fast and Thrash Metal influenced. Painkiller as an album is full of thundering double kicks, buzzsaw riffs and of course the highest standard of guitar solos.<br /><br />Along with the renewed energy from the band, singer Rob Halford pushes himself to his very limits on this album. At points it seems as if he is trying to win some sort of world record with his high-pitched screams.<br /><br />The quality of songwriting is excellent and there is no filler or weaker tracks. Songs like `Metal Meltdown,' `One Shot At Glory,' and `All Guns Blazing,' are all furiously energetic; Priest really delivered a supremely strong and exciting record with Painkiller.<br /><br />`A Touch Of Evil,' slows the pace a little and adds some variety to the proceedings, with keyboards from Dio/Ozzy/Deep Purple's Don Airey. The track is really powerful and when all the music climaxes and Rob delivers the line `You're Possessing Me,' I never fail to break out in a big grin.<br /><br />Overall, Painkiller is a fantastic album from start to finish. Atypical of the usual Judas Priest style, but utterly essential to anyone who likes metal nonetheless.

B00005R62N|5.0|Judas Priest's Unleashed In The East is one of those live albums. Album's like Kiss - Alive, Deep Purple - Made In Japan and Iron Maiden - Live After Death, where the performances are utterly electric and all the songs come alive more than on their studio counterparts.<br /><br />Unleashed' was released back in 1979 and consists of material from the four out of the band's five albums from the seventies performed live in Tokyo, and works as a great compilation of Priest's early output.<br /><br />Songs like `Victim Of Changes,' and `Diamonds And Rust,' sound utterly astounding on this album, they have such energy and intensity. The choice of songs is great, the production is great and the band are all great both individually and as a unit.<br /><br />Debate exists as to how much of the album is or isn't actually live, for example Rob Halford claims only the vocals were overdubbed in the studio. Personally, I don't much care either way when the album is this good. The bonus tracks on newer versions also help to redress the balance of material from Hellbent For Leather, of which there was little on the original vinyl.<br /><br />Overall; Unleashed In The East represents the best of Judas Priest's early output delivered in a dynamic and energetic fashion. It is an undoubted classic and a clear must have for any Priest fan.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|Althogh Eddie Vedder had released a soundtrack album, for most of the fans this is Ed's debut record. Nobody would think that an album of ukulele songs can be this good, as fan as I am I even had my doubts, but this is AWESOME.
B00138KKNU|5.0|udas Priest's Angel Of Retribution album was released in 2005 and saw the return of original singer Rob Halford on his first Judas Priest studio album for fifteen years.<br /><br />The album received a lot of positive press due to the return of Halford, but don't get too suspicious, this album wholly deserves the praise on its own merits too. The songwriting is superb, with a good selection of heavy and interesting tracks and a few ballads for variety.<br /><br />The material does a great job of mixing everything that was great about Judas Priest and tastefully modernising it; the songs don't actually sound like Stained Class or Defenders Of The Faith but they definitely do still feel like Judas Priest nonetheless.<br /><br />Highlights include opener `Judas Rising,' the heavy `Demonizer,' and the speedy `Hellrider,' all of which mix signature Priest sounds with a modern attitude, and the semi-ballad `Worth Fighting For,' which is a genuinely enjoyable song, in a different style than the band usually work with.<br /><br />The album ends with the infamous track `Lock Ness,' which is something of a laughing stock, but if you object to it you can end the album one track early and still have a top quality full length Priest album. If you think about it, all the classic Priest albums were only about eight to ten tracks long or so and `Lock Ness,' is the eight minute thirteenth track on an otherwise great album.<br /><br />Apart from the controversial `Lock Ness,' the album is basically flawless, with big riffs, nice solos, great drumming and Rob's fantastic vocals. In summary; a top drawer album, not just `good for a reunion album,' but just plain good.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Let me tell you that this first adaptation to the A Song of Ice And Fire series is a really good one. Somethings may have been changed, or may be they are not as you picture them when you read it, but that's what happens with any adaptation.
B00138EWGG|5.0|Judas Priest's ninth studio album was released in 1984. Defenders Of The Faith is an album often celebrated by Priest fans but isn't as famous as some of their other albums like Painkiller, British Steel or Screaming For Vengeance. The album doesn't feature as regularly in top 100 album countdowns but don't let that discourage you; this is a very good record indeed.<br /><br />After the band's previous album Screaming For Vengeance had taken the band to new heights of popularity, breaking the US market two years earlier, Priest had a tough job following it up.<br /><br />Defenders Of The Faith does a good job of trying however. It largely follows the formula of its predecessor, only with a marginally heavier and darker edge. Tracks, such as `Eat Me Alive,' and `Freewheel Burning,' are the type of big and exciting Heavy Metal songs that you want from Judas Priest, and they mix neatly in with slower material like `Love Bites,' or `Night Comes Down.'<br /><br />It could be argued that Defender's Of The Faith is a sort of perfect center of Judas Priest's 1980s output. Not flashy or innovative, not a big departure or a new chapter but an absolutely refined and well crafted album of the sort of music you want from the band.<br /><br />If you like Judas Priest, don't overlook Defenders Of The Faith. The songs are good, the performances are good and the album has all the wailing vocals and guitar solos that the band stands for. I highly recommend it.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|The even spread of 5 star through 1 star comments here reflect the subjective experience of the viewers more than any film I have seen recently. Now in his eighties, Eastwood directs a film whose theme lies close to heart of all people who have matured as they have aged. It is a reflection on the possibilities of the afterlife that we all think about as we age. Eastwood offers no answers but instead gives us 3 parallel stories of people who have experienced death or near death; a woman drowned in a tsunami, a psychic who sees his ability as an affliction, and a young boy who loses his twin to death. Each protagonist searches for answers, as we all do. Viewers may not be satisfied by that lack of concrete solutions but a film about death and acceptance can have no other ending. Some viewers may be fooled by the opening tsunami sequence into thinking that this is an action film. The absorbingly realistic set of CGI sequences that open the film makes other CGI laden films look artificial and lame. But it  is not an action film though studio marketing may have given people that idea. In lesser hands a film like this would be filled by after death pseudo babble that has been all to common in American cinema over the decades. Entertaining but trivial films such as 'Ghost' are pedestrian but pleasant to watch. TV shows like 'Medium' were light silly but enjoyable time wasters. Eastwood does nothing like that here. Instead this is a film for people who think, those who are at the end of life, and those who have had life threatening experiences. Highly recommended.
B00005K9LN|5.0|British Steel is one of those all time classic albums, like Reign in Blood, Number Of The Beast or Paranoid. The kind of album that half the things you've ever read have told you is amazing and beyond reproach and the other half has told you is overrated and nowhere near the band's best work. Sometimes its difficult to get an unbiased opinion either way.<br /><br />Released in 1980, British Steel helped Judas Priest a long way in becoming the institution they are and formed a large part of the public's perception of the band.<br /><br />The album contained the hit singles `Breaking The Law,' `Living After Midnight,' and `United.'<br /><br />Elsewhere; songs like `Rapid Fire,' `Steeler,' and `Grinder,' delivered the hard and fast metal sound that helped form the basis of the thrash sound a few short years later, while tracks like `Metal Gods,' and `You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise,' stay closer on the borders of rock.<br /><br />The quality of songwriting is genuinely good and there is no filler, this is a good album plain and simple. The band took everything they had been doing over their career and compressed it down into an easy to manage collection of pure metal.<br /><br />As Scott Ian is fond of stating, Judas Priest were the first band to really take up the banner of metal, to revel in the name, to champion the genre. They weren't ashamed, they wouldn't rather be thought of as a Blues band or a Folk band or anything else. They wanted to be metal.<br /><br />The material should speak for itself as this is a great record; if you like Judas Priest you may find another album you like more, but British Steel is one of the all time classic metal albums and there's not much you can do about that if you don't like that situation, it may have commercial appeal, some of it may sound cheesy to you, the production may be too slick for you... but British Steel is a classic.

B004LAIU4I|3.0|In the liner notes, Elvis Costello seems enamored of Paul Simon's most recent compilation. In my most humble opinion, I can't agree. Yes, Simon plays guitar very beautifully and has a way of combining rhythm and rhyme that are unique, but this is just too sleepy for my taste.   Two songs stick, after a couple of listens: The Afterlife and Rewrite. The good news is that these two songs are worth the price of the entire CD and as a bonus, there's the title song. The rest are okay for background music, but I'd just as likely skip over them and put in Graceland for the millionth time if I still needed more Paul Simon.

B0051MKNV8|4.0|Last movie I watched was \\"Limitless,\\" that one where Bradley Cooper (\\"The Hangover,\\" \\"Wedding Crashers,\\" et al.) takes a little pill and becomes unspeakably brilliant. I'd give this movie (in Amazon terms) 4 out of 5 stars.    As for the premise, it's not as insane (or cliched, even, I think) as you might guess. I thought that what would happen would be the typical \\"Scarface\\"-ish, poor-hero-starts-from-bottom-makes-it-to-the-once-unimaginable-top-now-comes-crashing-down sort of plot, but really it seems that, despite what I'd say is the impossibility of this ever happening, realism sort of kicks in as soon as the protagonist in this movie gets into action. What I mean is, he starts having to deal with the consequences of his actions as soon as he gets rolling. He finds out pretty quickly that he's gotten involved with some pretty bad people. For example, the man he got the brain-and-senses-enhancing drug from is murdered a relatively short bit into the movie. The pill is dangerous on several grounds; not only does it become apparent that some other people want the drug and are willing to kill those that stand in their way in order to get it, the drug itself has some negative effects on its users. It's basically like heroin: you become very addicted to it very quickly; actually, the biological penalty for not getting more of the drug is death.    What also surprised me is that Cooper's character, for the meat of the movie, never really makes it to the top. He seemingly has the ability to do so, but he has to start off working for other people that have more money than himself. Cue Robert De Niro (\\"Taxi Driver,\\" \\"Raging Bull,\\" \\"Meet the Parents\\" and, like, everything else), who of course in his later years makes for a pretty intimidating presence, that is, in the protagonist's life. I.e. De Niro's given such a short amount of time on the screen that all in all I felt his inclusion was wasted. He's actually more dangerous-seeming in \\"Meet the Parents\\" than he is in this movie. I'm not unhappy that he was in the movie though; I just hope he doesn't become one of those actors who are given these short little bits in movies to provide the film with a little more class and seriousness. (Like Marlon Brando in his later years; it's just sort of the sad evidence that these really powerful stars are beginning to fade.)    The movie took some turns I wasn't expecting, like, for one, the foreign gangster who intimidates the main character into giving him some of the drug, which in turn makes him really powerful and dangerous for a time too. Didn't think his role was going to become that important, but it does. Um, what else. Oh, yes: Hollywood's gotten into this habit of starting the movie in medias res where the hero's on the verge of doing something drastic, at which point it goes back to show you how it all started. This is one of those movies, but for some reason the viewer knows it's not going to end as...ah, flatly...as it initially seems. One last point: all in all some pretty cool and perhaps mild seizure-inducing visuals in this film.    I really don't want to tell you this, but really the only way this movie disappointed me was the ending. It was one of those \\"We can't really get out of this any other way, so let's just do this because it's safe\\" endings. And honestly, it wasn't bad; it was seemed to have been stuck on rather hurriedly. At the same time, I can't really imagine how else it could have ended, or at least, what a better ending might have been.  (The DVD features an alternate ending which I haven't watched.)    In short, I think \\"Limitless\\" will entertain you for its entire duration.

1594744769|4.0|Reason for Reading:  I couldn't resist!  This book has everything I love in one book: orphans, mysterious island, vintage photographs, creepy atmosphere and an old house.  How could I not want to read it.<br /><br />Here is a book that once again uses photographs and text together in a unique way.  The obscure, peculiar vintage photographs are simply illustrative, but the author has had to write his story around already existing photos which enhance the story to such a degree that the book would not be what it is without them.  The notes do say that \\"with the exception of a few that have undergone minimal postprocessing, they are unaltered.\\"  Really only one word sums up this book and that is the eponymous \\"peculiar\\" for peculiar it certainly is.  This is not a fast paced book, not one that will have you racing to the end for the grand finale which may put some of the intended audience off.  However, it is more meandering, taking its time, showing us all the \\"peculiar\\" characters, who and what they are, as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Jacob comes to the island to get over the death of his grandfather who had told him fantastical tales of this place his whole life to prove that it is just an island after all, but he quickly learns his grandfather's tales were true.  The story settles in and slowly reveals the secret of the island, the house, the children, Jacob's grandfather, and eventually Jacob's part in it all.  A very moody atmospheric story that I quite enjoyed.  I loved the characters and as a lover of vintage photos was totally fascinated with the photographs.<br /><br />My only concern with the book is a certain tone of vulgar language coming mostly from Jacob, the narrator.  There is some swearing but it is the vulgar images that certain language convey which is of more concern.  The only reason I can think of this use is to show that Jacob is from the here and now, as opposed to the 1940's of the other children, though some of those boys have vulgar turns of phrase as well.  I wouldn't recommend the book for younger children.  Also, the book ends with the characters all set to take on a new adventure which is obviously a set-up for a second book, which is rather disappointing as I am getting tired of sequels and series these days.  Whatever happened to the good ole standalone?  However, teens and adults should find a rather spooky read that will keep them entertained.uldn't recommend the book for younger children.

0141192429|5.0|This is a great book - the resident damsel in distress is beyond twee and at times almost intolerably irritating, but Marian Halcombe provides a nice counterbalance for the more feminist minded amongst us.  Also, (and this is a shallow point) in this case you can judge the book by its cover, because this edition is so beautifully presented and will look great on any book shelf.         The plot is compelling too, but not enough reviewers give Frederick Fairlie his due.  I don't laugh out loud at many characters in Victorian novels but his absolute devotion to himself and his imagined ailments (whilst others around him - including his vulnerable nieces - are in genuine peril) makes him an absolute scream.  As good as any caricature Dickens created.        I loved 'The Moonstone' but this is a better book, the characters are fleshier and it's simply a much more enjoyable read.
0345528581|5.0|As a 21 year veteran of the Army and long time free weight and gym participant, I can easily say this is a better way. I'm a 50 year old with decades of aches and pains from abusing my body in the Army Rangers. With a hip replacement at 49, and no longer able to run this program is perfect. No hard impact, great results. Easily set up a great \\"gym\\" (pull-up bar, dip bar and a couple other things in my garage). None of that is required however, Mark shows you how to do everything where ever you are.  Body weight training with compound movements are so much more effective at producing functional strength and improving body composition.  As Mark points out, the military has used these techniques virtually forever.  I never recall feeling like my Army PT instructors lacked the ability to work every muscle there is to the point of failure. Mark goes into great detail showing all sorts of variations to increase or decrease the degree of difficulty for each movement. I'm very impressed with his exercises, he is really innovative. I've bought copies for several of my young nephews to help them save their bodies from the wrong way to exercise. I highly recommend this book and give it 5 stars.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|Return to OZ is my absolute most favorite movie of ALL TIME. My mom got me into the movie when I was like 6 or 7 [I am now 30], and every time I watched it, I would be hunkered down on our couch, and when they got to the Princess Mombe [sp?] scene w/her getting out of bed with no head, I would jump from where I was sitting, onto the top of the couch & have a pillow over my face. It still scares me to this day. I can pretty much quote her word for word.. Which is pretty sad. Anyways, I love this movie. I have a 4 1/2 yr old son who would probably be so scared he would pee in his pants if he were to see it, so I don't think it is really suitable for children that young.. BUT apparently back in the mid to late 80's, it was alright for a 6 yr old to see it. So glad to see it is out on DVD. YAY DVD! :)

Watching it, I felt hopeful that there will be more opportunities for high-functioning autistic students to gain higher education, even those students whose odd behavior and habits need to be acknowledged and accommodated. Genius is present in many forms, and viewers may watch this and reflect on students in their own past who had so much to offer, but were sidelined because they were considered unteachable or just weird. Worth watching more than once, and something you will share, so buy a copy for your reference library.

B003Y5H5A6|5.0|Well, the summer will soon be nearing its end, although the temperatures outside don't seem to agree. With the changing of the seasons also comes the inevitable conclusion to the summer of superheroes (that's what I dubbed it a few weeks back). And now, with the release of \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" this year's heroic reign over the box office for beloved comic book icons will soon be coming to a close.    \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" is the story of Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a young man who wanted nothing more than to fight alongside the brave soldiers in World War II against the Nazi onslaught. After being rejected repeatedly due to his frail physique, Steve volunteered for an experimental treatment that would transform him into a living, breathing super-soldier. Meanwhile, a Nazi scientist named Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) is attempting to harness power beyond anything this world has ever seen, and Captain America may be the only one strong enough to stop him.    After so many entertaining entries this summer ranging from Marvel's \\"Thor\\" and \\"X-Men: First Class\\" to DC Comics' \\"Green Lantern\\", did the heroic summer end with a triumphant victory or a disappointing defeat?    The answer, as evidenced by the movie's opening weekend box office victory over \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2\\", combined with mostly positive reactions from critics, is that the summer of heroes definitely ends on a high note. And I for one wouldn't have expected anything less from the star-spangled avenger.    Taking heavy cues from classic Hollywood escapism, the likes of which haven't been seen in quite some time, the film embraces its more traditional atmosphere without being heavy-handed or cheesy in the process. Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (\\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\") this film easily feels right at home in the ever-expanding pantheon of Marvel's self-produced comic book movies, but with some noticeable differences in storytelling.    One of the big differences you'll notice, aside from the aforementioned atmosphere, between this movie and the ones Marvel Studios has released prior (including this summer's \\"Thor\\"), is that the story is much more serious-minded than the others. The majority of the previous films tied into this universe featured serious dramatic story arcs, but always with heavy doses of humor laced throughout to keep things sort of light-hearted.    That type of approach worked fine for those characters, and in the case of Thor it probably made his transition from comic book page to big screen that much easier to believe. However, for Captain America, a story filled with jokes, one-liners and sarcasm, even if they feel appropriate to the story, would have been completely wrong for the ever-stoic soldier and future leader of the Avengers.    Thankfully, the writers paid attention to this (most likely with some heavy hints from Marvel) and avoided those mistakes. While there is still the occasional joke, they are few and far between; leaving us with a movie that captures the essence of Captain America perfectly. Plus, having a little joke here and there is good to break up the potential monotony of the drama unfolding, I was just glad Cap wasn't the one cracking wise.    Another major difference between this film and the others, is that here we are presented with a hero who always dreamed of doing nothing more than fighting for what's right. In today's comic book movie landscape I can't think of any characters with this mindset. To me this was so refreshing because finally we get to see one of the few characters that's doing precisely what he's always wanted and sought after. As opposed to having the heroic mantle thrust upon him by circumstances (Iron Man or Spider-Man) or being born into it (Thor).    Now, to clarify I am a comic book fan so I already knew that Captain America was one of the few heroes that willingly accepted the heroic mantleplaced before him. I just wasn't sure if the movie would keep this aspect intact or change it to be more cookie-cutter and follow the tried-and-true recipe of so many of the other adaptations over the years.    Despite my foreknowledge of that particular character trait for Cap, I still found it a fresh approach to a genre that has so many similarities within origin stories. After all, there are only so many types of origins one can tell before you become repetitive.    One last difference with this film, that I shall touch upon briefly, is that this was a pure origin story from start to finish. With most other comic book films the origin portion of the character's first movie comprises approximately half to two-thirds of the overall running time. This movie doesn't finish Cap's origins for this cinematic universe, meaning taking him from first becoming the hero to being ready for next summer's \\"Avengers\\", until the credits roll.    This was important because the other Marvel Studios movies featured stories set in the modern day; whereas, Captain America was created during World War II. So, for him to believably fit into the modern day landscape of 2012's \\"Avengers\\" team-up film, the movie had the unenviable task of introducing the character and doing justice to his time in World War II. All the while, somehow bringing him up to the modern day setting we've become accustomed to with the other films. Not an easy set of tasks, but one that the writers and director Joe Johnston pulled off quite nicely.    Speaking of director Joe Johnston, I was personally a little skeptical when he was handed the reins to this key piece of the \\"Avengers\\" film puzzle. He's a director that has been hit-and-miss with big budget franchises or franchise makers throughout his entire career.    Sure, he did an admirable job taking over for Steven Spielberg to helm \\"Jurassic Park 3\\", but even so, the movie wasn't as strong as its predecessors. Most recently he was responsible for what ended up being a snore-fest of a reintroduction to a classic movie monster with last year's \\"The Wolfman\\". But, after watching this film, I have to say that I don't know if anyone else could have handled the movie any better.    Truth be told, whether you like or dislike some of the movies in Johnston's filmography, one thing is for certain, he may have been preparing for this movie his entire career. With his work on the two movies I mentioned a moment ago, and his history with visual effects during the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy, all of that served to prepare him for the numerous action sequences and vast CGI work necessary for bringing such a character to life. But, perhaps the most pivotal point of preparation for him may have occurred during his directorial work on 1990's \\"The Rocketeer\\".    That film was by no means a financial success, and ultimately failed to kick-start a franchise for Disney. However, the movie's perceived shortcomings were not a fault of the director in my opinion. Reason being, the film was actually quite entertaining, but the marketing done by Disney was poorly planned and failed to really sell audiences on the vast adventure awaiting them inside the theater. Despite all that, the film's retro style, attitude, and timeframe are comparable to \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\", and may have been the key to Johnston's success on this picture.    Speaking of the film's success, much of the movie's box office victory over the final \\"Harry Potter\\" installment could easily be laid upon the shoulders of its star, actor Chris Evans. Even though Chris had already become known to comic book fans for his spot-on portrayal of the Human Torch, I personally believe that it will be his performance here, and in the sequels to follow (including \\"Avengers\\"), that Chris will be remembered for in the eyes of comic book fans.    Chris' portrayal is the perfect blend of idealism, strength, honesty, and authority that makes Captain America one of the purest heroes in comics and film. Now, it was a going concern among fans that perhaps Chris was miscast given his penchant for sarcasm. However, for Cap, Chris reportedly chose to remove several humorous lines of dialogue in order to stay true to the character. That choice was one that I personally appreciate, because it shows a respect for the source material; a trait which will always be pivotal to any comic book film's success.    Fighting alongside Chris and serving as a potential love interest for Cap is actress Hayley Atwell (TV's \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\"). Hayley brings a strong sense of authority to the role of Peggy Carter, but with a touch of vulnerability for being a woman amid a predominantly male setting (i.e. fighting in a war). Not to mention, a slight playfulness that belies the soldierly outward appearance and exposes a young woman who would at times like nothing more than to flirt with a guy, namely Steve Rogers/Captain America.    In the other major supporting roles are some terrific actors; such as, Tommy Lee Jones (\\"The Fugitive\\"), Stanley Tucci (\\"The Road to Perdition\\"), and rising star Dominic Cooper (\\"Mamma Mia!\\"). Each of these supporting players is responsible for the film's few humorous bits, while still delivering very entertaining, solid performances.    As always veteran actors Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci elevate any project they appear in, but it is Dominic Cooper that surprises me the most. His portrayal as Howard Stark (Tony Stark's father) is great, especially as he infuses shades of Robert Downey, Jr's portrayal of Tony from the two \\"Iron Man\\" films. For me this nod to his future son's personality further cemented the cohesive nature of these interlinked films that Marvel has been producing over the last few years.    Now, I mentioned that Captain America was a great hero and Chris Evans perfectly captured all of the qualities necessary to make him so; however, every hero is only as great as his villain. For this purpose, actor Hugo Weaving brings the supremely evil and despotic Johann Schmidt, also known as the Red Skull, to sadistic malevolent life.    When playing a character codenamed Red Skull, and one that has the physical qualities to inspire such a moniker, I think it could conceivably tempt an actor to sort of ham it up. Basically, go into a scene-chewing mode as the sneering bad guy who does everything evil just for kicks and all that's missing is a handlebar mustache for him to twirl in his fingers. Thankfully, as with many other potential pratfalls that could have plagued this movie, this one was avoided as well.    Actor Hugo Weaving, who is no stranger to playing a major villain (he was Agent Smith in \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy), portrays Schmidt in a way that is obviously sinister, but without becoming an over-the-top caricature. This was vital to making his character more believable to audiences given his garish appearance and thirst for other-worldly power beyond belief.    What I mean is that his motives are deeply twisted and malevolent, he is a Nazi after all, but you see the sincerity in how deeply he believes in what he's doing. That he's not just doing these evil things just for the sake of doing them. He has a purpose and he believes it to be right. Thus, as a character he is much more believable, amidst all of the more outlandish elements surrounding him, including his own appearance. Again, just another aspect that was pivotal to making this film work.    After all that being said, as I mentioned earlier, the summer of superheroes definitely ended on a high note. Plus, with a movie this solidly entertaining, featuring a home-grown hero, to bring the season to a close is perfectly fitting.    So, as you have undoubtedly figured out by now, \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" is an excellent adventure film. And one that serves as a fun throwback to classic escapism from Hollywood's past. The movie easily lives up to its Marvel Studios predecessors and firmly cements this hero from a bygone era's place in this hyper-real cinematic universe that began back in 2008's \\"Iron Man\\".    \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.
0553801473|3.0|The first three books of the Song of Ice and Fire are three of the best fantasy books you will ever read, hands down they are brilliant.  Book four to me was the equal of say Godfather III, took years to get and was a major let down.  Years later we finally get book 5, much better than book 4, has some really cool moments, but ultimately does not move the series forward or any closer to a finale.  There is a point as a reader where you can only read so many 1,000 page \\"transition\\" novels, think of Robert Jordan.  Is it fair to put a loyal reader through that?  Jordan wrote how many \\"transition\\" novels and never finished his series, unfortunately I think starting with book 4 George RR is going that route.  I will not give anything away here or spoil anything: the bottom line is the book is a big improvement over book 4, but ultimately is frustrating in that new characters are introduced, our old favorites do not really move forward for most of the book.
B004WJREPO|4.0|Although not as good as \\"McCartney,\\" it made the re-release more enjoyable than the original, even with a few duds.
B003Y5H574|5.0|This film centers on love and the problems in relationships, as well as human cravings, failings, growth, and successes in heterosexual companionship. It is well acted, funny, and moving.<br /><br />All the actors are great, starting with Ryan Gosling (who is always fantastic), and also Steve Carell, Emma Stone, Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei, Kevin Bacon, and the child actors, Jonah Bobo and Analeigh Tipton.<br /><br />Gosling as the cool guy who can pick up and bed almost any beautiful woman he wants is amazing. In addition, he tutors Carell (a self-described \\"cuckolded husband\\") to successfully wind up with women in bars. Tomei is also terrific as a horny schoolteacher, as is Stone as a young lawyer who resists Gosling's advances, Moore as Carell's wife and Bacon as the guy at work with whom she has an affair.<br /><br />The script is intricate and surprising at times, as the characters turn up unexpectedly here and there.<br /><br />The film not only has many humorous lines, but also makes you care about the characters--a winning combination for a romantic comedy.
B005B7IPG8|2.0|I never understood why certain films with foreign actors get the acclaim they do. A sad movie (and not the kind that makes you cry but the kind that makes you want to hang yourself). There doesn't seem to be a plot or anything that drives it. It's basically about a couple surrounded by depressing and superficial individuals...so sad.
0756405890|4.0|This is a decent novel from an up-and-coming fantasy writer, Patrick Rothfuss.  The book tells the tale of Kvothe, a ragamuffin boy with a penchant for magic.  Rothfuss creates a vividly drawn world with detailed character development.  You read the book and get pulled into the scenes that Rothfuss has painted.  Rothfuss also writes with a biting wit, as evidenced by the conversation exchanges that Kvothe has with numerous characters.  I read this book in 8 hours straight so a pretty good indication of the quality.    That being said, there are some issues with the book.  The magic system is not very innovative-I guess Robert Jordan was the last writer who was able to create a really memorable magic system.  Not a huge issue but something that could have improved the book.  The book's major problem, though, is with flow.  The beginning and middle of the book are paced very well but towards the end when Kvothe is pulled away to an urgent errand, the book seems to slightly unravel.  This journey seems to yield almost no information about Kvothe's quest and seems disorganized (the errand seems to come out of nowhere).  It would have been better if Rothfuss had provided more plot development prior to having Kvothe undertake this trip or have Kvothe find something more meaningful during the journey.  Finally, nothing in the book seems to link back to the first incident at the bar with the scrael.  Where did they come from?  Who is leading them?      If I could have, I would have given the book 3.5 stars.  It's a good read but needs some work to iron out the kinks.  Hopefully Rothfuss manages the process better next time around so that future books can go from good to great.

1593975457|4.0|While this set plays fine in a walkman-style CD player and my car, it will not play through my computer or a stand alone CD/DVD player.  Disappointing in that it can't be added to my iTunes playlist.  The others in this series download just fine.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Great headset for gaming!  I use this headset for playing Starcraft 2 and really enjoy the sound quality and the ability to put the mic into the headband for easy storage.  The mic works, but is a little soft - although that may be my sound card and not the microphone itself.  Very comfortable and they feel very sturdy.  In the summer months they make your ears warm because they are well padded but that will be nice in the winter.    The only bad thing I have to say is the sound quality is muffled, the bass is great but the mid- and high-ranges are not as well reproduced compared to my logitec 2.1 system that cost four times as much.  It's an unfair comparison for sure.  For the price, the sound quality is fantastic, I think.    Great for gaming, absolutely.
0307341577|5.0|It's been more than a month since I read Gillian Flynn's second novel. And it still stands in my memory as one of the most notably dark, disturbing and beautifully written novels I've read in recent past. On several occasions I had to put the book (actually, the kindle) aside in order to regain the sense of my reality. Not meaning to raise eyebrows, but sometimes it felt like the characters in the book were taken-out from a Dostoyevsky's novel. I'll read this book again, but it will take me some time before feeling able to tackle it for a second time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins has written one of the most incredible books I have had the pleasure of reading in \\"The Hunger Games\\".  Partly science fiction, mixed with heart wrenching drama, along with action adventure that keep you on the edge of your seat, this book will keep you up reading long past bedtime, and is so hard to put down, I finished only stopping once to charge my Kindle, and could not wait to finish.  Not too involved to the point of ever becoming boring, and not leaving you wanting for more, this book is the perfect balance and a must read for anyone interested in just a plain different, excellently written book with as unique a story line as I have seen in quite a while.  To think Mrs Collins just made this up out of thin air makes the reader appreciate that this author is as intelligent and imaginative as they come.  Thank you for this story and I hope you can come up with another one as unique as this one!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I realize that I am only giving this backpack four stars. It would easily rate a five star rating overall if for one, you are a smaller individual. The material construction is top notch, the pockets and overall layout are thoughtful, and it can hold a heck of a lot of gear. I currently have packed into mine five lenses, a flash, a gripped SLR, and a spare P&S and it held all that easily. Of course, space is maxed out but on the flip-side, I have easy access to all my gear. I came from a 7 Million Dollar Home Crumpler and it held all the same gear except without the ease of access this backpack provided.    The side straps I basically use to hold my iPad2 in its travel case when traveling. The combination so far has gotten me through multiple airport security checkpoints with a minimum of fuss. And this is where my gripes with the bag come in. For a 300# guy, this bag is too small to truly be comfortable. Every single one of my gripes with this bag revolves around the design too small for me to wear comfortably. The straps are too small, and it is a chore to get on and off my back at times due to the small size. Having to make the strap longer to wear comfortably means that the bag does not sit properly on my back and as such, leads to it being somewhat uncomfortable after a while. I will be taking it for a proper hike in the next month or so and will update my review to reflect any new findings (I've yet to wear the backpack while wearing standard summer fare).    All in all, it is well worth every penny I spent on it. I will be jumping on a super-sized version if Amazon ever releases such though.
0316098329|5.0|If I could have stayed awake long enough, I would have finished this book in one sitting. I don't pay much attention to sensational news, so this was a completely new concept to me... and a shocking one at that. A young woman kidnapped and imprisoned in a backyard shed for seven long years; the narrator of the tale is her five-year-old son, Jack - a stranger in a strange land trying to understand his fellow humans, reminiscent of Valentine Michael Smith ([[ASIN:0441788386 Stranger in a Strange Land]]) but with more heart.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|When receiving my kindle, I was ready to start reading many books and hoping to find interesting and entertaining literature. I came across \\"Before I go to Sleep\\" when trying to find books. i was reluctant to purchase it but it was well spent. I enjoyed this book from start to finish.     The organization of the book helped with the additional suspense and eagerness to read. From the start of the book I was wanting to read more. I finished Part 1 of the book within a day (which is impressive since I don't get a lot of time to read during my day).    At the end of the book I was so happy and sad. I loved the ending, wishing that there was more to read, but I was sad that it was over. I am hoping that S. J. Watson will write more books as FANTASTIC as \\"Before I go to Sleep.\\"    Purchase this book... but be warned, it has A LOT of adult content.
B000002WPI|5.0|I've had my brother in law's Wu Tang cd for 3 years! He actually thought he lost it but I've had it the whole damn time! I am a song writer and for anyone who is a song writer of Hip Hop like I am, and you hit a brick wall due to writer's block, I suggest you pick up anything from the Wu Tang Clan. I can't tell you folks how many times I have gotten numerous edges of inspiration from the Wu alone, especially this album. It's raw, it's gritty, its true New York Hip Hop. If you want \\"swag\\" the Wu is not for you, but you if want something that is real, then this purchase is 100% worth the cost!
B001GCUO5M|2.0|Plot spoiler. Do not read if you think this film should surprise you with its 'shock' ending.     There are great 'bad' films and bad 'great' films, and SI is of the latter type. The problem is film requires coherent characterization and narrative for it to be film (unless film of the experimental type no one watches). I could never embrace the idea that a psychiatric roleplay could be so realistic and yet hallucinatory. Or that hallucinations could add up to anything so coherent that they could be integrated into a narrative film. Besides it's a bit too much coincidence for this guy to have horrifying war experiences (including possibly war crimes) and a crazy murdering wife who drives him over the edge too. About the only outcome I could understand for this character, a man of action, would be to kill himself after he killed his wife (for murdering their three children). This is Scorcese making bad films, and he has made plenty of them. Surprisingly DeCaprio is bearable, but I can't help but think Ruffalo would have been better in the lead role.     In a nutshell, this film is a bit like Kubrick's 'The Shining' colliding with the 60s TV series, 'The Prisoner'. Even if you are taken and distracted with the cinematography, one has to question if the psychiatric underpinning of the story makes any sense at all. Perhaps Scorcese, if he wants to deal in pure images, ought to abandon plot the way Greenaway and Lynch have.
B00000K0T8|5.0|..and I finally purchased the Ironman album. I got to hear what all the hype was about. Classic music like this is very hard to find, especially down here in Houston, TX. I love everything that is on here but my favorites are The Faster Blade, Wildflower (this song reminds me of Stapleton Sex which is on the Wizard of Poetry!), Camay (sexy song!), Daytona 500 (the Speed Racer video lol) and Soul Controller used to be on the first one, but I got the one that was reprinted, so go on youtube to hear that one. But this whole album is jamming! Young folks this is an album I would play in front of my mother...as a matter of fact she likes this very much and she is in her 60s =)
B00000331V|5.0|As great as The J. Geils Band could be on any studio recording their live albums (and any live performance) could blow away their great work in the studio.<br /><br />\\"Blow Your Face Out\\" (a comment that Peter Wolf makes during the live concert here and on their previous one)catches the band in their prime. Yes, they had bigger hits later (and recorded some terrific albums) but THIS is the best live album they ever made and one of their finest as well.<br /><br />More than double the length of \\"Full House\\" (their third and second best live album)\\"Blow Your Face Out\\" contains key album tracks from throughout the band's early career (it was their eighth album). What's nice about \\"Blow Your Face Out\\" is that it compliments the other two live albums as there are only a few tracks that show up on all three albums.<br /><br />The remastering by Bill Inglot and Ken Perry for the 1993 reissue has a number of good points including the use of the original mastertapes for this version. Inglot's mastering style is a bit on the bright side for some folks so just be aware of that when you pick this up. I don't have a problem with it. If you appreciate his other work, you'll appreciate this as well.<br /><br />The booklet has extensive liner notes with info on each track.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B001B51B9M|5.0|This is a classic musical.  I've seen it several times on stage and television, but it is few and far between when it is available.  Decided I wanted to own it only to discover that the original was only available on Blu-Ray.  Redone versions are just not the same, but that was available in all sorts of forms.  Snatched up the Blu-Ray version before that wasn't available either.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I really enjoyed everything about this movie!  The characters are wonderful, the costumes right on----the scenery was magnificent!  I love the day to day subtlties that you have to really listen to catch!  It was on my third viewing that I actually heard Donald Southerland ask Lydia and Kitty if they were taking the veil.....I rolled!!!!!  It is a shame that today's movies do not have the class of this movie------no sex scenes, no revealed flesh, and yet it is a very romantic movie.  the early morining after Aunt Katherines unpleasant visit, when Lizzie and Darcy meet is exquisite!
B002ZG9800|5.0|Waited & waited for release of this film, finally heard it was being shown as an in-flight movie (!!),so Amazon to the rescue, & what a gem it is!! I'm a big Jim Carrey fan anyway, & as others have mentioned, the chemistry beween him & McGregor makes all the difference, that, plus a great script. Also, the word \\"heartfelt\\" keeps cropping up; it is indeed that, as well as erotic, very funny, tender & sweet-natured & raunchy. Wouldn't call it a \\"gay\\" film, it's a human film. Check out the marvelous \\"Happy, Texas\\", if you liked \\"ILY,PM\\", & all praise to the folks who brought this to the screen, it's really something to be proud of,& to enjoy in the profoundest sense of the word.

0307477479|1.0|Note: This review is for the physical object only, NOT for the text itself which is beautifully written, experimental, and highly deserving of its award and critical acclaim.  This paperback constitutes the single worst binding job I've ever encountered (and I am a seasoned reader/buyer of novels and work in publishing). The cover of my book severed entirely, then the pages fell out in sections. I will likely have to pay more to have it rebound than I did for it initially. I hate the idea of tossing a work of literature into the recycling bin. Splurge on the hardcover, people--there's a reason this edition is so cheap ($8). You get what you pay for.
B000GIXLO8|4.0|LoR:E  See my review of the Return of hte King. I review the Lord of hte Rings as a whole, because as my annoying sister points out: \\"Tolkien wrote the epic as one book, but at the time of publishing the publishers decided to split it into 3 books so that it would be more apealing to readers, seeing it as a series and not one 10k page book, and to make more money from sales.
1451629184|5.0|It is absolutely amazing that Jacycee is as strong as she is today for all that she went through. Her writing is amazing. I could not put the book down. I read it in one day.Her story is heart breaking and inspirational. Don't let what happened to her not let you read it. It is an amazing book.
0439023513|2.0|Let me start by saying that I read all three books in 3 days. They were THAT hard to put down.    After reading the first two, I couldn't wait to read the last. I almost wish I hadn't.    Yes, the book was action packed and intriguing, but the charm of the first two books was nonexistent. The lovely scenes between Peeta and Katniss were few and far between, if at all. That was the thing I most loved in the first two books. The book left me feeling depressed and angry.     The end felt rushed and thrown together. Characters you grew to love and root for were needlessly killed off. I wish I had stopped after book 2. :(
B001P06GX4|5.0|As one of my friends says \\"Blokus makes you lose friends.\\" Our games can get pretty intense and stressful, which is all part of the fun! Or maybe it was the beer talking. Yes, we can turn any game into a drinking game.     The game has simple rules, is easy to pick up, and actually involves strategy and THINKING! That's why it's MENSA approved. You can have fun and feel like a smarty pants at the same time! I especially like that each game takes less than 30 minutes so the game never feels tedious. If there was a negative, I think it would be that the game plays best with 4 people and isn't quite the same with 2 or 3.     The board and pieces seem pretty durable and are sure to provide years of entertainment. Whether you're 13 or nearly 30, like we are, Blokus is a good time all around.
1400052181|4.0|Far more fascinating than I ever anticipated, this book carefully re-constructs how Henrietta Lacks became immortalized, and even lionized, in the scientific community--all unbeknownst to her. Although portions are a bit more scientific than I enjoy, I skimmed over those parts and was drawn into the human story behind the science. Kudos to the author for her tenacity in uncovering these facts and her sensitivity in presenting them.
B001AQMBJG|2.0|[[ASIN:B001AQMBJG Lolita (Amazon Exclusive) [Blu-ray]]] In my opinion, the original Lolita is one of the best movies ever made. The problem with this Blu-Ray version is that it hangs up in the opening menu and won't play. I've tried it on three machines and it hangs up in the same place on all three.  It's a shame.

B000B5MI3Q|5.0|Update:  After some online research on how to date a Seiko watch, I've determined that my watch was manufactured in April of 1983.  It is, in fact, not an SKX007, but rather a 6309-7049.  The SKX007 is essentially a descendant of the 6309 design.  Given my experience with the 6309, IF it ever dies I won't hesitate to replace it with an SKX007.    I have owned this watch since the early 80s.  I was stationed on the island of Okinawa, Japan and bought the watch for diving there.  This watch has been down to 120 feet on more than one occasion and through numerous dives of varied depths.  It's always been a favorite watch.    I've had several other watches of various brands over the years since.  But I keep going back to this one from time to time.  Recently, when the battery in my most recent watch died, I pulled this old favorite out of a drawer after about 5 years of not wearing it.  I set the time, gave it a few shakes to get it started and it still runs like a champ! I'm considering getting a new band for it, since it still has the original and the little retainer that holds the end of the band is broken.  But other than that, this watch is in fantastic shape!    This is a great watch design that will last many years.
B00123B9TU|5.0|This is a great album by Rush. I have always liked everything that Rush puts out. They have music that makes you stop and think. I like how Amazon sells there music. You just get the \\"Downloader\\" installed in your computer and that is it. The Downloader is free. What is really neat is after I got this album from Amazon it moved it over to my iTunes account automatically. I thought that was very cool.
B004XECNCW|5.0|In 1991, \\"Boyz in the Hood\\" was seen as a film about the hood that got things right!  A film that would showcase to society all around the world about what was taking place in South Central Los Angeles, a statement of what life is in the hood but also for American cinema, showing us the strength of cinema created by a young African-American director and a relatively unknown African-American cast.<br /><br />Well-created, well-written and powerful performances that continue to hold up today, \\"Boyz in the Hood\\" was more of a statement of violence in South Central Los Angeles, it was a statement of inner city violence and giving a voice to those who live with this violence around them everyday, 24/7.<br /><br />The film would be the theatrical debut of filmmaker John Singleton (\\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\", \\"Shaft\\", \\"Four Brothers\\") and a film that would earn him an Academy Award nomination for Best Director and Best Writing and would be the acting debut of hip hop star Ice Cube (\\"Friday\\", \\"Barbershop\\", \\"xXx: State of the Union\\") and the first major theatrical role for actor Cuba Gooding Jr. (\\"Jerry Maguire\\", \\"Men of Honor\\", \\"Pearl Harbor\\").<br /><br />The film would rank in the top 10 of the American Film Institute's \\" Top 10 Gangster Films\\" and in 2002, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \\"Culturally significant\\" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Boyz n the Hood\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  Having owned this film in a variety of home video versions, I can easily say that the Blu-ray release is much more detailed than the any previous video version.  You can see the detail in the hair of Tre and Doughboy, you can see the colors which are much more vibrant on video, skin tones are natural and black levels are nice and deep.<br /><br />While the film does show its age due to the early '90s clothing and this film is not going to look like it was made recently, I can say that for its 20-year anniversary, this Blu-ray release is the definitive version of the film yet.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Boyz n the Hood\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Thai, German and Italian 5.1 Dolby Digital.  While the film is primarily a dialogue-driven film, there are some moments of crowd ambiance and scenes where there are gunshots and surround channels are used.  It's not a immersive film in the sense that you have active surround channels but the dialogue and music for the film is crystal clear and sounds great via lossless.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Hindi, Italian, Korean, Norwegian, Swedish, Thai and Turkish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Boyz n the Hood \\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Director's Commentary - A wonderful in-depth audio commentary by director John Singleton.<br />  The Enduring Significance of Boyz N the Hood - (24:48) Presented in HD, the director and cast are interviewed about the importance of \\"Boyz n the Hood\\" and what the film meant to them.<br />  Friendly Fire: Making Of An Urban Legend - (43:17) The original special feature in standard definition for \\"Boyz n the Hood\\" with interviews with John Singleton, the producers of the film and the cast.<br />  Deleted Scenes - (4:25) Featuring two deleted scenes: Tre discusses the future with his mom and Furious confronts Doughboy after Ricky is shot.  In standard definition.<br />  Music Videos - (9:00) featuring the music videos - Compton's Most Wanted Music Video Growin' Up in the Hood and Tevin Campbell Music Video Just Ask Me<br />  Audition Videos - Featuring a split screen audition videos (use your audio button to change to the audio of the certain cast member) featuring Ice Cube, Angela Bassett, Morris Chestnut & Tyra Ferrell<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Powerful, thought-provoking, well-crafted and a magnificent film from filmmaker John Singleton!<br /><br />\\"Boyz n the Hood\\" is a film that actually remains close to my heart, mainly because when I first watched it, I was a young adult at the time and it was one of the first films where I got into an explosive debate with another viewer.<br /><br />I can easily remember at the time when the viewer made the comment of how the film was \\"fluff\\" and was nothing but a film to propagate gangster culture.  Needless to say, the debate was heated and it was the only instance in my life where I was quite shocked by how anyone would look at this film as \\"fluff\\" and dare I say it, I was about to throw down.<br /><br />For me, the film was thought-provoking and important.  I personally have had the experience of moving into Southern California, being a new person and just being in awe, fear and shock about gangs.  I never had to experience that growing up but going to high school in Southern California and reading day-after-day of gang shootings, even myself experiencing parties being attacked by gangs and just seeing how things were, it was something that I was never accustomed to.<br /><br />From seeing gated high schools to hearing about people from other high schools crashing into other high schools and stealing from students.  Even experiencing trouble when I went to visit a friend at another high school and there was a gang fight and because I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and someone from another high school, I was taken in and having to face the school administration.  I just remember that it was too much and trying to explain that I know nothing about gangs, I'm just a guy from small town and here I was in a city where crime is taking place in schools, fears of gangs are not only at school but you worry about it on the bus ride home, walking home alone in the neighborhood and afraid of getting jacked at night, these were things that were uncommon to me and scared the crap out of me.  Especially having to be asked constantly from other young teenagers at the time, \\"What set you from?\\" and having no idea what the heck they were talking about.<br /><br />With the opening statement at the beginning of the film:  \\"One out of every twenty-one black American males will be murdered in their lifetime.\\" and \\"Most will die at the hands of another black male.\\"<br /><br />Those are low odds and it seems that its hard to believe in but having read the newspapers, seeing it every night on the news, these situations happen in South Central Los Angeles.<br /><br />But this is normal life for a lot of people.  For me, it was completely foreign but I was intrigued by all of it because it's something that I never saw reported where I lived in.  And here I was in So. California, watching films like \\"Colors\\" and listening to N.W.A. and heading to the local hip hop store in Long Beach to check out the latest hip hop that I've heard on KDAY.<br /><br />And I remember moving out of So. California and just thinking, \\"It's a shame that no one knows about the violence in South Central Los Angeles.  It's a warzone out there!\\"<br /><br />And so I was deeply touched by the film because John Singleton had a deep message about this film, about the state of blacks in the hood, about trying to solve the problem but knowing that the cycle of retaliation keeps going and going.  And  because it showed how lives in the hood can be changed in an instant for families and friends and its a cycle of sadness and death, unless there are those who want to make a change.<br /><br />And so when I first watched this film and one person declaring it as \\"fluff\\" and \\"propagating gangster lifestyle\\", I took offense to the comment.<br /><br />This was not about gang lifestyle, this was about lifestyle in a predominately African-American area where there are those who want to make a difference and those who are part of that continuing cycle of violence.  It was a problem that was starting to reach a boilingpoint in American media and because of the music and films like \\"Boyz n the Hood\\", it was a film that showed the world about things that I was constantly seeing on the newspapers and news.<br /><br />You feel for these characters because personally, I have read way too many articles in my lifetime about talented young athletes and innocent people gunned down because they were mistaken for someone else or did something to tick someone off but it's a life of fear that happens on a weekly basis in South Central and other areas around the United States.  This is how life is, it's not \\"fluff\\" and I was so angry about the comment that I was debating so passionately defending the film because I know that those characters, those situations as depicted in the film was very realistic.<br /><br />So, it surprises me that 20-years-later, the film has been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry, the film received two Academy Award nominations and it would help initiate the surge in the careers of filmmaker John Singleton, rapper Ice Cube, actors Cuba Gooding Jr. and Morris Chestnut.  The film was well-acted and felt it was well-done!<br /><br />So, here we are with a 20th Anniversary release of \\"Boyz n the Hood\\".  Featuring the same special features on DVD but with a Blu-ray exclusive on the enduring significance of the film.<br /><br />If you have never watched the DVD before, then this is a pretty solid Blu-ray release.  Granted, not all special features will be in High-Definition but having owned this film previously on VHS and DVD, I can easily say that this is the definitive version to own of the film at this time.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Boyz n the Hood\\" is a thought-provoking and wonderfully-crafted film from John Singleton.  It came out at the right time and really spotlighted the problems that were taking place in South Central and bringing it to the masses and for the most part, its long-lasting efficacy was that its a true film.<br /><br />Characters and situations that seem realistic and for the most part, the situation of what was boiling at the time in South Central Los Angeles made a statement in society.  But now knowing that even today, not just in South Central Los Angeles but all over the country and these problems still exist and thus the film still has relevance today.<br /><br />\\"Boyz n the Hood\\" is a film that is American cinema at its best and also an important film that help take part in giving recognition to Black filmmakers but also talent.<br /><br />This film is highly recommended!.    With the opening statement at the beginning of the film:  \\"One out of every twenty-one black American males will be murdered in their lifetime.\\" and \\"Most will die at the hands of another black male.\\"    Those are low odds and it seems that its hard to believe in but having read the newspapers, seeing it every night on the news, these situations happen in South Central Los Angeles.

B000UD0ESA|5.0|How does one perfect on perfection? Well, what little there was left to improve upon, director Ridley Scott found a way. Blade Runner has a checkered past. Its production was plauged with monumental problems from start to finish.Even with the changed ending and the naration added in, the theatrical release is still an incredible film to behold.     For Ridley Scott who is a perfectionist, it went over budget causing issues with the studios. Upon its late summer release, Blade Runner was pitted against summer block busters like Star Trek II,E.T and surprise hits like Conan The Barbarian. With its dark story and content, it didn't stand a chance with the public's demand for \\"feel good pictures\\" and \\"happy endings\\".    Flash forward 10 years and Blade Runner finds new life and appreciation with \\"the director's cut\\",the version that it was meant to be and be seen.And now 15 years following its director's cut re-release; Ridley Scott's \\"Final Cut\\" of Blade Runner is the ultimate masterpiece in Sci-Fi film noir.    There is nothing to pick on in this version of Blade Runner, it is flawless and still to this day, I get goose bumps and the hairs on the back of my neck stand up from the opening scene of the not too distant future of the hellish,overpopulated,polluted horizon of 2019 Los Angeles. This is a captivationg story that most all of you know is based on the Phillip K. Dick novel, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\"    As with most novels turned film, the screen play deviates quite a bit from the novel, but retains its basic elements and Dick's portrayl of a dark,dismal,over populated, disconnected,technology dependent and polluted future which doesn't stray too far from our present day reality. His ever questioning \\"What makes us human?\\" is the real character basis and drive in Blade Runner and \\"Do we as humans have the right to play god?\\"    Sumerized to its basics, Replicants are artifiscial humans that are genetically designed for combat or for dangerous,toxicwork that humans cannot do.They are superior in strength and at least as intelligent as the scientists and engineers who designed them.     Problems with replicants caused their makers to instill a four year life span and after some escape and find their way back to L.A, our plot thickens. Deckard is an Ex cop/Blade Runner.Someone who hunts down illegal replicants and retires them.After he is forced back into service, he is put on the case to flush out the tresspassing humanoids and dispose of them.On that journey, he uncovers far more as the case unravels.    To tell more would ruin seeing the film if you haven't seen it already. You really have to like \\"film noir\\" and with Blade Runner's Sci-Fi roots and dark atmosphere, it just really melds perfectly with the screen play. Harrison Ford is as dry and strait arrow of a character as you could think of. Hardned from his past as a Blade Runner and alomst as emotionless as those he hunts.     Not enough can be said about what it really means to have  excellent writers in tune with the material they put to screen. Blade Runner also has probably the most incredible cinemaphotography seen on screen in 80's cinema.It is beautifully photographed frame to frame and scene to scene, and  let's not forget about the amazing visual effects produced by Douglas Trumbol.     Next to Return of the Jedi, Blade Runner is probably amongst the last Sci-Fi masterpieces of visual effects.All was done practically with flawless matte paintings,light,smoke and superbly hand crafted film miniatures long before computers and CG became a regular tool at the disposal of directors and FX studios.    If you are a true fan of cinema, sci-fi and great story telling, no DVD library should be without Blade Runner. I've been a huge fan of Blade Runner since its debut and while many don't like or appreciate the original theatrical release it is still a fine film even with the flaws.     However, to find true appreciation of this film masterpoiece, \\"The Final Cut\\" is about as perfect as it gets.It has been digitally \\"cleaned up\\", but really only one scene CG enhanced to mark a monumental improvement  and eye sore over the original.This is Ridley Scott's finest film I.M.O and it is shameful that he was passed up for recognition let alone an Oscar and that the film was passed over for multiple Oscar nominations at the time so long ago.     What could be more perfect than a film that keeps coming back that no one really forgets as it rises from the ashes like a Pheonix to be re-invented?If you love film, film noir and good sci-fi you will never tire of this film.I can watch it over and over and always discover something new. Most films fade away, but its the true classic that never dies and sears itself into your memory, and Blade Runner \\"The Final Cut\\" is one of them.
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|In 1981, German filmmaker and screenwriter Wolfgang Petersen began their work on the film adaptation of Lothar-Gunther Buchheim's 1973 German world war II novel.<br /><br />Buckheim who was an officer in the German Navy was a war correspondent who drew and took photographs and in 1941, joined the U-96 on their seventh patrol during the Battle of the Atlantic and with his experience, he wrote \\"Die Eichenlaubfahrt\\" (The Oak-Leaves Patrol) and later on writing a novel based on his experienced in \\"Das Boot\\" (the Boat) which would feature him as a fictionalized autobiographical character known as Lt. Werner.<br /><br />As Wolfgang Petersen took on the directorial reigns of \\"Das Boot\\", not only would the film become the most expensive German film at that time, it would be the most daunting and challenging film that the filmmaker has ever worked on and though the film was not a financial success, it was critically acclaimed, a big hit in the United States and other countries, winner of two of the six Academy Awards that the film was nominated for and also would eventually lead Petersen to an International career which would lead to him directing Hollywood films \\"In the Line of Fire\\", \\"Outbreak\\", \\"Air Force One\\", \\"The Perfect Storm\\" and \\"Poseidon\\".<br /><br />It is important to note that \\"Das Boot\\" was released in 1981 as a 150-minute film.  The longer version that many people watched was a three 100-minute episode series aired on television in 1984 (followed by six 50-minute episodes in 1988).<br /><br />Seeing the power of how the longer TV series was compared to the original theatrical film, producer Ortwin Freyermuth who worked with Petersen on his 1991 film \\"Shattered\\" asked the filmmaker about the possibility of taking the longer footage from the TV series and creating a longer version of the film.  Petersen was open to it but only if Freyermuth can raise the financing to make it happen.<br /><br />And sure enough, Ortwin Freyermuth made it happen! And it's due to the emerging DVD technology at the time as studios wanted to release films for a generation who cared about the quality of film and audio.<br /><br />But it was not that easy as the original negatives for the film was submerged underwater due to a flood and while many of the reels were rescued, the audio portion was damaged to the point where existing sound would have to be baked and captured digitally.  Fortunately, both video and audio were rescued and the painstaking effort of editing by Hannes Nikel, getting copies of the original soundtrack from Klaus Doldigner and working with a company to bring the film with new immersive surround sound and also re-recording the English dubbing for the film.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Das Boot - The Director's Cut\\" was released on DVD and became a best selling DVD and for many DVD fans, is a must-own release!<br /><br />Fast forward to 2011 and here we are with \\"Das Boot: 2-Disc Collector's Set\\" improving on the wonderful DVD version with 1080p High Definition and as for that soundtrack that everyone loved, now it is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.<br /><br />The 2011 release comes with both the Director's Cut and the original theatrical version plus newer special features including an exclusive new documentary and more!<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Das Boot: 2-Disc Collector's Set\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1). It's important to note that this film was released back in 1981 and also that this film is 30-years-old.  This movie was created before CG and a lot of the scenes were created with technology that was used back then, including the use of miniature models. It's also important to note that the version that the worked on is the longer director's cut version.<br /><br />So, with that being said, let's begin with the \\"Das Boot: The Director's Cut\\".  This version of the film looks fantastic and much better than its DVD counterpart.  You can actually see the skin pores, the various age marks on the skin of the Captain, the hair follicles, the detail of clothing to the detail of wounds.<br /><br />The colors that you see from the red and blue lighting (amber colors come alive during the British convoy on fire) is colorful and vibrant and while skin colors are natural and black levels are deep, there is a good amount of grain that can be seen but also the actual film seems to come alive.  I was very impressed by the picture quality of the film.<br /><br />But it's not 100% perfect.  There is some banding during certain scenes that really showcase the lights and of course, certain shots of the submarine (shorter scenes), you can see a lot of noise which probably is more enhanced in HD than it was on DVD.  By no means is the banding or the noise affecting your viewing pleasure of the film because those scenes are rather short and miniscule to the more positive PQ scenes throughout the film.<br /><br />\\"Das Boot\\" on Blu-ray makes a world of difference compared to its DVD counterpart and PQ-wise, this film looks magnificent on Blu-ray!<br /><br />As for the original theatrical version, while presented in a higher bit-rate, it doesn't have that sharpness, contrast and detail of the longer Director's Cut version.  In fact, some parts, you can tell that the look of the film, looks its age.  But there's no comparison to the PQ of the shorter film versus the Director's Cut.<br /><br />Also, while most people may be intrigued to see the original theatrical version and see what newer scenes were added to the Director's Cut, if anyone is to watch \\"Das Boot\\" for the first time, one must watch it via the Director's Cut version.  It's the best way to watch the film and it does make a difference.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Das Boot: 2-Disc Collector's Set\\" is presented in German and English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And clearly, the lossless soundtrack is phenomenal.  If you have the proper audio setup, \\"Das Boot\\" is magnificent.  You can each droplet of water and is it lands, hear every bubble from the outside of the submarine, hear the steel of the submarine compress and expand, hear the ambiance inside the submarine from the men who are working during the most silent of times to the most alarming of times during battle.<br /><br />Ambiance of one walking on the metal flooring, the twisting of a valve, a call from the distance, a scream from the distance, the radio playing at a distance, the torpedo hitting its targets to a depth charge hitting the U-boat, \\"Das Boot\\" is immersive!<br /><br />Even outside of the submarine, the swishes of ocean water from left to right and right to left and while you are in the middle watching and feeling you are right there!  You hear everything and as much as the DVD version was wonderful in terms of its soundtrack back then, one must watch \\"Das Boot\\" in HD to truly see how the lossless audio soundtrack enhances one's appreciation for this film!  I was amazed to hear the sounds this much clearly and this much immersive compared to when I did watch this film on DVD.<br /><br />It's also important to note that the music by Klaus Doldinger and hearing it in lossless is also wonderful!<br /><br />While it was my preference to watch this film with its original German dialogue in 5.1 DTS-HD MA, there is a English dub included.  Bare in mind, the voice acting is British (and in some way, it felt weird to watch German's speak British, since the enemy on the water was the British) and because the original German film wanted to showcase the various dialects, the same can be said with the British voice acting and some of the dialogue is hard to understand and I felt I needed the subtitles on just for that.  But you do have a choice between the Germana and English lossless soundtrack!<br /><br />It's one of the few films where audio and also silence makes a big difference in a film and I can tell you right now, this is a brilliant lossless soundtrack!<br /><br />Subtitles are Arabic, Danish, Dutch, English, English SDH, Finnish, French, Hindi, Norwegian and Swedish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Das Boot: 2-Disc Collector's Set\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  Filmmakers Commentary - Featuring a new audio commentary by Wolfgang Petersen revisiting the director's cut version of the movie along with Ortwin Freyermuth.<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />  The Perfect Boat - The Director's Cut - (13:02) The process of \\"Das Boot\\", the theatrical movie, the TV series and the making of the longer version of the film and the challenges to make the longer version in 1996.<br />  Maria's Take - (9:16) Maria Petersen (assistant director) reflects with husband/director Wolfgang Petersen on working on the set of \\"Das Boot\\".<br />  Historical Material - Featuring the original \\"Behind-the-Scenes\\" 1981 featurette (1:00:20) and \\"The Battle of the Atlantic\\" (1983) featurette (40:18) which is a German documentary with interviews with former WW2 veterans from both the German and British side.<br />  Captain's Tour - Inside the Boat - (8:12) Actor Jurgen Prochnow gives us a tour of a submarine - Rooms Overview, Entry Conning Tower, Torpedo Room and Crew Quarters, Captain's and Officer Rooms, The Control Room, Petty Officers Room & Gallery and Diesel & Electric Motor Rooms.<br />  Wolfgang Petersen - Back to the Boat - (44:48) Wolfgang Petersen, Jurgen Prochnow, Director's Cut Producer Ortwin Freyermuth visit the original location of where \\"Das Boot\\" was shot and visiting the submarine and reflecting on memories from the past.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Das Boot: 2-Disc Collector's Set\\" comes with a slipcover case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Das Boot\\" is one of the best war films of all time!  It's also the definitive masterpiece for filmmaker Wolfgang Petersen.<br /><br />While I do know that the original author of the \\"Das Boot\\" novel had issues with Wolfgang Petersen's film and how certain situations depicted in the film (such as the crew partying in their quarters to have fun and make time fly by quickly), the fact is that this film is brilliant in many levels.<br /><br />Not only does Wolfgang Petersen capture the loneliness of men being inside a submarine and capturing the various emotions that the men inside the submarine had, may it be out of boredom, fear or being in survival mode, the truth of the matter is that war is ugly and there are wide range of emotions that can take place in war and Petersen manages to get this crew of unknown talent, many who have never acted before, to make the film feel true and authentic.<br /><br />Bare in mind, this was not a easy film to shoot.  Not only were smaller-sized models and life-sized models of the submarine were created but the crew would shoot during the worst of conditions and risk their lives in order to make these shots work.  Even production delays took place as the worst things that one can imagine happening during filming, did happen.<br /><br />According to Petersen, the crew and talent were extremely exhausted and tired (as it required a long time to shoot the film, unexpected delays as well as a grueling schedule to get things right) and those scenes with the crew submerged in water, apparently one even caught pneumonia.  Even the submarine that took one year to build was damaged during the storms and while the crew and film were able to get back to land safely, Petersen awoke to a urgent call that the submarine has disappeared.<br /><br />Not only had it disappeared, parts of it were in the middle of the ocean and later hitting ocean shore.  Plagued with even more problems, the crew manage to take the salvaged parts and make it happen.

Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock played by Jurgen Prochnow.  He is the man who holds his emotions in check for the crew, trying to remain calm and not let anyone know of his emotional well-being, especially when it looks very bleak for the submarine and the entire crew.<br /><br />I may not be the Word War 2 aesthete but I do know when I watch a good film, not only technically through its direction, editing, cinematography but also a film's storytelling and performance.<br /><br />This film, \\"Das Boot\\" was not an easy film for Wolfgang Petersen.  It's never easy when you create a film based on Nazi Germany and focus on the Nazi's.  The fact is that many people on the boat were young people who probably didn't care or know the extreme about political ideals.  The captain was cynical towards war and his role for the Nazi's and you have young people being young people on a submarine, not discussing the Nazi extremes or politics or even Hitler.  These people were hired to do a job and follow their captain.<br /><br />By no means does this film glorify the Nazi's because by film's beginning and by film's end, and of course knowing the history of the U-Boats, you know that things don't go well for the Germans.  The question is who lives? Who dies?  And what are the situations that will clearly affect the crew.  I can tell you right now, when I first watched \\"Das Boot\\", it was an ending I was not expecting and by the film's end, I was pretty content with how Petersen ended the film.<br /><br />\\"Das Boot\\" does not contain the banality of WW2 films but it should set the criterion of what can be accomplished with no-name talent and dedication from the talent all the way up to Wolfgang Petersen. This film is a true masterpiece!

Petersen gives a lot of credit due to the director's cut version's success to his editor Hannes Nikel who worked on making this longer version a reality during a time when Petersen was busy working on \\"Air Force One\\".<br /><br />And as complicated it was to get all the reels of film, getting all the sound digitized and all the painstaking work in making this director's cut a reality, it was met with great success and while my original review of the DVD was very favorable, this Blu-ray release defied my expectations.<br /><br />\\"Das Boot: 2-Disc Collector's Set\\" is magnificent!<br /><br />And I'll say this again.. \\"Das Boot\\" is one of the best war films in cinema.

B003K1EYM6|4.0|The card reader can be used to import media files directly into your iPad, without the need to sync to iTunes.    Extremely handy! Quick! Usable \\"on-the-go\\". Great for travel.    There are a few details you need to know to import media files this way.    1). Create a folder on any SD card and name that folder \\"DCIM\\".    2). Place media files into the DCIM folder.    3). Important: The media file names have to be exactly 8 characters long (no more, no less), or the iPad will not see them.     Examples: 8letters.mp3, 8numbers.jpg, 8Numbers.mp4, TheBirds.mp4, Img_9001.bmp.    Those are really the main details, but here are a few more:    When you insert the Card Reader (one of two devices in the kit) into the iPad, with an SD card in it, in a moment the iPad screen will show thumbnails of all the media files on the card.     You can import some or all into the iPad. You cannot play media files from the card, you must first import them. To select some media files, just touch them to highlight them and choose \\"Import\\". Or, you can select \\"Import All\\".    The iPad will ask if you want to Keep or Delete (on the card). Be careful to select Keep (in most cases).    Valid video files need to be in the \\".MP4\\" format, version H.264. Or convert them to that format using almost any conversion program. I chose a size of 640 x 480, and it was perfect for filling up the screen.    NOTE: the media files are imported into the \\"Photo\\" section of your iPad. Even the MP3's and Videos. So, to watch a movie, for example, select the Photo icon, not the Video icon on your screen (it won't be in the Video section).    AND, you can delete any media files after playing them. That way, you can, for example, load a movie or two into the iPad, watch, then delete to make room for others.     You can carry an unlimited amount of media files with you, perhaps on a trip. Why not 100 GB or more? Fantastic!    ONE MORE THING [N.B.]:    When I first tried to import the media files, I knew about the DCIMfolder (it's the same as your camera would create), but the 8 character requirement I hadn't known. Only one media file showed up.     So I called Apple and spoke to a senior support staff member. I was repeatedly LIED TO. Repeatedly. Which I found infuriating. Apple, or any company, is not required to give me information just because I want it. But lying about it is NOT appropriate.    One of the reasons for their \\"misstatements\\" likely is that prospective iPad buyers might not opt for the larger capacity iPads if they knew this information. New iPads like the iPad 2 charge a large premium for the extra memory, and it's very, very profitable for Apple. So be it. But Apple, don't instruct your employees to lie about it, and give them prepared scripts to mislead customers. Harrumph!!!    Remember, there is nothing magical about how your camera puts files on an SD card. The Camera Connection Kit Card Reader doesn't know the difference (there isn't one) and does not care, so long as it meets the requirements listed above.
0525422943|4.0|I'm dangerously close to 5 stars with this. WHERE SHE WENT was so much better than its predecessor, IF I STAY. I wasn't able to put this one down and I couldn't say the same for the first book. Not to say that you could just skip the first book because you do need the introduction to characters, setup, understanding of Mia's journey, etc. This one is told from Adam's point of view, 3 years later. To say he's struggling is putting it very mildly. I love the way the author captured him, his heartbreak, his metamorphosis. Forman's voice was much stronger with Adam and throughout this book versus the first.

B002N4DZ58|5.0|I am a fairly new Wagnerian. When I was searching for my first Tristan recording several years ago, I followed conventional wisdom to purchase the classic 1952 Furtw&auml;ngler/Flagstad set, hailed by many as the absolute pinnacle of recorded Wagnerian musicianship. Unfortunately, I just didn't get it. My inexperienced ears couldn't (and to a large extent still can't) get past the poor sound quality, and the work remained an enigma.<br /><br />I went out on a limb and bought this recording--and the pieces suddenly fell into place.<br /><br />My \\"breakthrough\\" was due in no small part to Placido Domingo's Tristan. Yes, Domingo is an unconventional Wagnerian and nearing the end of a very long career. However, the sheer beauty of his voice and interpretation is to my ears unique among Wagner recordings. He brings his acclaimed dramatic nuance to the third act especially, for a final half hour that is almost horrifyingly gripping.<br />Nina Stemme's Isolde is elegant, rich, and untiring. Catch her live if you can--she is a formidable actress in the theater.<br />Further, the sound is warm and full, augmented by Pappano's detailed conducting. Now I wish I had a better speakers to do justice to it!<br />All in all, this is the recording I would most quickly recommend to newcomers to the work, both for the excellent sound quality and for the sympathetic performances of Stemme and Domingo.

030745455X|4.0|Having heard all the hype surrounding Stieg Larsson's \\"Millennium\\" trilogy, which seemed to be fuelled by the author's untimely death just as much as the content of the books, I read [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] and was entertained, despite its unsettling subject matter. The second of the trilogy, though up to as many as ten books were planned, continues the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist and computer-hacker Lisbeth Salander in another crime-meets-psychological-thriller that purports to shed light on the dark underbelly of a country that is considered one of Europe's most liberal countries.<br /><br />Still dealing with the upheaval of the previous book, in which he exposed a corrupt businessman and solved a cold-case murder, Blomkvist is finding life extremely busy with his magazine \\"Millennium\\" and a controversial new article that is set to expose the illegal sex trade industry, naming several prominent public servants in the process. Lisbeth meanwhile, with her bank account full of stolen money, is enjoying studying math problems while traveling the Caribbean. Having saved Blomkvist's life in the previous book, she has cut off all contact with him after realizing that he does not reciprocate her feelings for him.<br /><br />Divided into four parts, the first ten or so chapters are rather tedious as Larsson gets all the pieces of the story into place, but also wastes time with minutia about what various characters are drinking, who they're sleeping with, and how their apartments are decorated. We're about one-third of the way through the book before the double murder which kick-starts the plot actually occurs. It seems like a fairly straightforward case for the police, and the manhunt begins for the individual whose fingerprints have been found on the murder weapon: a gun left on the stairwell. Soon the papers are plastered with the image of Lisbeth Salander, wanted for murder.<br /><br />Lisbeth's small circle of acquaintances is desperate to believe that she's not guilty, but Lisbeth herself has gone into deep hiding, communicating only through hacked computers. Blomkvist begins his own investigation into the murder of his colleges as the media promote Lisbeth to the public as an anti-social lesbian psychopath with a criminal record - though the police force are quite surprised to find that this description of Lisbeth is completely at odds with how those close to her describe her.<br /><br />Quite simply, Lisbeth Salander is a force of nature, and most definitely the selling point of the \\"Millennium\\" trilogy. Though she can be almost comically skilled at times, from her boxing talents to her computer hacking to her photographic memory (and you will not *believe* what she manages to pull off in the final chapters), she also makes for a fascinating character and a riveting read. Capable of great kindness and terrifying violence, Lisbeth lives by her own moral code and is virtually unstoppable in anything she sets her mind to. This poses the risk of making her one of those dull invincible heroes as you'd see in any Hollywood action film, but Larsson portrays her as a deeply damaged person, delving into her childhood and the period of her life that she quietly refers to as \\"All The Evil\\" to bring new insight into her psyche. Although her amazing intellect is still something of a plot device (Larsson throws terms like autism and Asperger's syndrome around, but never really examines what they mean) she is still the driving force of the series, and undoubtedly the reason for the books' success.<br /><br />It's interesting then, that she's missing for the middle section of the book, which instead focus on Blomkvist who seems utterly bland in comparison - though Lisbeth's absence does further her mystique and deepen the mystery. I suspect Blomkvist was a little bit of a self-insert for the author what with his moralistic crusade and his irresistibility to every woman who crosses his path, but he provides a nice counterpoint to Lisbeth's fire and in a book so filled with corruption and violence, it comes almost as a relief that Blomkvist is presented as a man of integrity and decency - even if he is a little too good to be true.<br /><br />Once the story really gets into gear it makes for a riveting read, though the plot hinges on several rather implausible coincidences. So often two people with no prior contact whatsoever will end up at the exact same place at the exact right time in order to fit two pieces of the puzzle together (minor spoiler - it's because of this that the final solution to the murder-mystery isn't particularly rewarding). Especially strange is the sudden appearance of Paolo Roberto - a real life Swedish boxing champion - who has a part to play in the proceedings, however superfluous.<br /><br />Ironically, the pacing of the book suffers from the exact opposite problems that its predecessor did - whereas \\"Dragon\\" was drawn out unnecessarily after its climactic scene, \\"Fire\\" takes ages for the plot to get moving and then ends suddenly without much resolution. With this in mind, it's interesting that Lisbeth and Blomkvist are kept apart for most of the book, whetting our appetite for their (hopeful) team-up in the third and final completed novel [[ASIN:030726999X The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]].<br /><br />As with \\"Dragon\\", Larsson tackles several difficult topics, including sex trafficking, media hysteria, police corruption and the abuse of power by those in authority, but although some of it can get rather heavy-handed (you can bet that a character's attitude toward women will be indicative of their status as a good or bad guy), none of it is particularly gratuitous. Whatever problems are inherent in the plot, you can tell that Larsson is passionate about the subject matter. It's as almost if he's channeling his frustration with the double standards and the social injustices in the world through Lisbeth: a vessel that fights back with weapons that range from hammers and pepper spray to super hacking powers.<br /><br />I'm not usually a reader of the thriller genre, and the subject matter is perhaps too dark for me to ever seek out the films (I can handle the written word better than seeing such images on the screen) but I've enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy, and I'll definitely be seeking out the third.

This is now both my kids and my favorite Disney movie. Easilly the best Disney movie I have seen, great characters, great story, and very fun. The 3D was pretty spectacular too. Only in some scenes was it really noticable, but they did a good job of integrating it elsewhere too.    Worth the purchase as it has been played dozens of times.

B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of Bronte and have seen and own every version of Jane Eyre that has been done.   This movie by far  HANDS DOWN is #1.   I went to see it 5 times when it came to a teeny tiny little theater in Washington DC.  It was very limited release, but I hunted for it until I found it!  It was the only theater in the DC area that had it (E Street Cinemas on 11th street and E  downtown Washington DC).  That theater is amazing by the way..and if anyone is in DC and wants to see some amazing foreign or independent films you came to the right place. Be prepared to pay $10 for parking in their parking garage unless you luck out and find a spot on the street!.    The actors in this film draw you in and the theater was silent the entire time except for when EVERYONE cracked up laughing at some great British dry humor.   Rochester was so HOT! Oh Michael I love you!!  Oh man was he absolutely amazing!   Jane was played by an amazing actress.  I had seen Mia in  \\"The kids are alright\\" and she is quite a wonderful actress who has a big career ahead of her!.  Jamie Bell as St John, Tamzin Merchant as Mary (she played Georgiana Darcy in Pride and Prejudice (with Keira Knightly), Sally Hawkins plays a very cruel Mrs. Reed most incredibly (she played Ann in the new BBC Masterpiece Persuasion)...and then put Judi Dench (PERFECTION)  in the role of Mrs. Fairfax and now you have a PERFECT cast to play in this adaptation of my most favorite book of all time!   BUY THIS MOVIE..you will not be dissapointed!   What an incredible love story!  I dragged husband to it once and he even liked it...but he rolled his eyes alot  haha.  It followed the book really well..with just a few minor changes that didnt detract at all.  The biggest change from the book is that they made The Rivers family... Janes Cousins and in that book that is not the case...that really was strange, but actually worked okay..just not expecting it.    Blanche Ingram was not used to make Jane jealous, and they kind ofmade alot of her character dissapear of sorts.   OVerall I was thrilled with the movie and I have never in my life seen a movie 5 times at the theater..so that should tell you something.

However, arriving at the end of the book, we are left with an uneasy discovery: the author leads us through numerous stories and anecdotes that relate to habits and practices that are proven only to CORRELATE with happiness and not CAUSE it.  The Harvard  student thread is left disappointingly underdeveloped as well. A bit disappinting, especially from a Harvard instructor....<br />On the positive side: the style of the writing is quite palatable, if you are looking for a not very demanding bedtime read.
0545123275|4.0|normally I prefer a faster pace story in a book but there was such a real richness to the characters of Sam and Grace and their Romeno and Juliet type situation one can't help but fall in love with them. Only problem I have with whole trilogy is the changing of the first person from chapter to chapter and who is being referred to in that first person.      Grace was attacked by a wolf pack years ago and wasn't changed into a were wolf. She always seem to have had a connection with the wolves since such as feeding the wolves in the woods outside her house and the tales she tells her friend Olivia. When the locals consider the wolves too dangerous and decide to thin the packs a bit the wolves decide to strength themselves by first taking Grace's friend Jack who is presumed dead and later bit Olivia who hide the fact from Grace as long as possible as Sam struggles to keep his human form and be with Grace as long as he possible can.   Without Grace becoming an actually wolf or him remaining in his human form their not sure how their love will survive. Especially with Grace's parents thinking that its just a fling that Grace will move out grow.
B003G4W49C|5.0|*** I AM EDITING THIS REVIEW IN LIGHT OF CARD'S COMMENTS ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE APROPOS OF THE RECENT VOTE IN N. CAROLINA. IT LITERALLY PAINS ME THAT AN AUTHOR CAPABLE OF SUCH GORGEOUS AND NUANCED PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSIONS IS REALLY JUST AN UNABASHED BIGOT RIDDLED WITH UNRESOLVED ISSUES ABOUT HIS OWN SEXUALITY. WHILE I'D LOOKED FORWARD TO READING THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE ENDER SERIES, THERE'S NOT A CHANCE THIS MAN WILL GET A SINGLE CENT MORE FROM ME. ***<br /><br />Where sci-fi and fantasy novels can often bog in the technical details of the world they're attempting to create, the telling of Ender's story doesn't lose its footing.  The fact that it remains so tightly focused on the psychological and emotional is what made it enjoyable for me.  I wasn't trying to out-guess how the author would use some trick of sci-fi physics to move the plot because Card doesn't go there.  The story is achingly human throughout and Card's repetoir of language to illuminate the inner workings of his characters is spot-on.  I get that a whole bunch of other reviewers seem to have quibbles with this focus on the human interior as opposed to a spaceship's exterior, but I wholeheartedly endorse this as not only great sci-fi but solid literature.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|2.5 stars.    Written in survival guide format, this book provides detailed instructions on how to prepare for and survive any kind of zombie incident, from small outbreaks to zombie world domination. In addition, zombie physiology and historical zombie events are discussed.     I couldn't decide whether I liked or hated this book, so I split the difference on the stars. On the one hand, this book made me feel, for the first time, amused, scared and grossed out all in the same moment. On the other hand, this book made me feel, for the first time, amused, scared and grossed out all in the same moment.    For a fictional (I hope) work, it so very thoroughly covers the subject matter that one could believe that zombies do exist, and that protective measures are required. Props to the writer on that. If you're not interested in this kind of thing, though, it seems to go on much longer than it has to.    So, although this isn't the kind of book I would usually read, it was a good break from the same old. I could see how it might not appeal to everyone, however.
B004SBX112|3.0|ok game but freezes sometimes and everyonce in a while an ad will pop up even though its not suppose too
B000OVLINI|4.0|3.5 stars.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I like books about books. If the plot didn't include this element, I'd probably have given it a lower rating.<br /><br />This story is about a boy who discovers a book with a backstory: someone is going around buying/stealing the author's books and burning them. As he grows up, he continues to investigate both the book and the author to discover why someone might want to do that. While doing so, he meets an assortment of characters, from villains to shady lurkers to beautiful women.<br /><br />I enjoyed this plot full of intrigue, mysteries and lies, revealed little by little. I could certainly see this book being made into a movie like The Da Vinci Code was, and it would probably be quite entertaining.<br /><br />However, I'm not sure there's much else beyond the plot. The characters all seemed like I had met them before in some other book, and I could probably classify each one into a stereotype. Some of the scenes too also seemed like I had seen them before somewhere. Writing/translation was very good, but I've read better. In other words, if books were people, this book would be just another person in the crowd.<br /><br />All in all, recommended if you're looking for a decent piece of fictional intrigue, but don't expect it to be a masterpiece of literature.
B0050PLT8W|2.0|I'm a big Theory of a Deadman fan including them in concert once and really enjoying it.  I was excited to hear they had a new song on the radio, and was looking forward to a new album.  Disappointment is the only word I have.  The fast songs sound extremely mainstream, and the slow songs all sound alike.  I'm really glad I checked it out before I wasted my money.  It was on in the background as I was working on my computer, and after the slow songs kicked in nothing caught my attention.  I can appreciate a good rock song, but redneck vulgar is a bit much for me, and unfortunately that's all the lyrics of the upbeat songs are.  The tribute to our military wasn't on my cue list - maybe I would have liked it.  I've really enjoyed all the old albums; hopefully they'll bring that back with a good hard rock twist.
0679731725|5.0|Other reviewers have described the premises, so I'll jump right in and say that what, for me, sets this book a world away from other works of literature is the real depth of the characters. Many, if not most, works that I have read have characters that lack believability in two possible ways, usually co-existing in the same book. One flaw is that character transformation occurs too suddenly in a manner that doesn't make sense (i.e. there's an epiphany moment, from which point the person acts in a different way than before); the other flaw is that other characters fail to change at all, and do not even pause to think about what is happening around them. The Remains Of The Day perfectly avoided both of these traps. What drew me into Stevens and the other characters here was that as the story progressed, each person believably shifted in thinking and struggled to adapt to changes around them, but the changes to behavior were exactly what would be expected of a real person.<br /><br />In addition, a less skillful writer would have likely been incapable of such a masterful ending. Although by 2/3 of the way in, I could see how the book was likely to end, the words on those final pages were unexpectedly moving.
B0059FBQWW|5.0|Kamelot fans may already know Amaranthe vocalists Elize and Jake, since they toured with them last year (I saw them in Atlanta and was impressed).  They are very good, as is the overall Amaranthe sound.  Amaranthe blends up-tempo, melodic power metal with hints of extreme metal (using a third vocalist - fortunately, not over done), industrial, and goth.  Most of all, they are very energetic.  Their first music video, for Hunger, is also very good and popular on Youtube.  Overall, a great new band.

B004HO6I4W|5.0|Filmmaker/animator Carlos Saldanha has brought success for Twentieth Century Fox with the various \\"Ice Age\\" films and while the films have been popular for FOX, many companies are quite competitive when it comes to theatrical films and when it comes to marketing, especially for a big budgeted animated film, you need all the push you can get.<br /><br />And Saldanha's \\"Rio\\" (budgeted at $90 million) will definitely need that heavy marketing push.<br /><br />With probably one of the most ingenuous collaborations in recent memory Twentieth Century Fox's tie-in with video game company Rovio, the creator of the immensely popular mobile game \\"Angry Birds\\".<br /><br />Prior to the film, millions of people all over the world got their chance to play \\"Angry Birds Rio\\", a mobile video  game which has been downloaded over 10 million times.<br /><br />With a successful tie-in with the game and bringing buzz to the animated film, \\"Rio\\" went on to make $476 million dollars in the box office.  A successful hit and Twentieth Century Fox and Rovio are back again, teaming up for a Blu-ray and DVD release (set for Aug. 2nd) which not only comes with the film on Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy but also has 15 bonus levels for \\"Angry Birds Rio\\".<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Rio\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition and is presented in widescreen (2:40:1).  As one would expect from a film that takes place in the jungle and many colorful birds being featured throughout the film, \\"Rio\\" looks absolutely vibrant on Blu-ray.  Colors galore!  Wonderful detail on the feathers and beaks of the birds, backgrounds and details of rocks to the buildings and even the interiors of the homes look great.<br /><br />If there is one word to describe the picture quality of the film, that word would be \\"colorful\\".  Expect to see many colors pop throughout the film and for the most part, be content with its awesome picture quality!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Rio\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English descriptive audio 5.1 Dolby Digital, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.<br /><br />The film contains a lot of ambient noises that sound fantastic coming through the surround channels.  It's one thing to have samba musical sequences that sound crystal clear and lively coming from your home theater as there is good use of instruments from surround channels.  Front and center channels showcasing the dialogue and music is also crystal clear.<br /><br />But the film does showcasing excellent ambiance and overall \\"Rio\\" has a pretty solid lossless soundtrack!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Rio\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Angry Birds Rio Trailer - (1:25) Trailer for \\"Angry Birds Rio\\".<br />  Angry Birds Rio: Nigel Mashup - (2:17) A video featuring Nigel holding the Angry Birds captive.<br />  Angry Birds: Exclusive Clue Video - (:29) Featuring a video on how people can obtain things online via a code.<br />  Deleted Scene - Fruit Stand - (1:30) A deleted scene (via sketches) with the voice acting.<br />  Explore the World of Rio - An interactive tour of Rio (featuring sights and sounds).<br />  Saving the Species: One Voice at a Time - (24:49) A featurette on the voice acting fr the film, featuring interviews with the cast and behind-the-scenes look at them recording those scenes.<br />  The Real Rio - (9:31) A featurette on how the filmmakers toured Rio as research for the film and the things they got from visiting Rio.<br />  The Making of Hot Wings - (8:02) A featurette on Will.i.am and Jamie Foxx recording their scenes for \\"Rio\\".<br />  Boom Boom Tish Tish: The Sound of Brazil - (13:30) Featuring interviews with Diretor Carlos Saldanha, film crew and also with Sergio Mendes and Carlinhos Brown.<br />  Carnival Dance-o-Rama - Dance lessons courtesy of the characters from Rio.<br />  Welcome to Rio Music Video - (1:37) A music video welcoming people to \\"Rio\\".<br />  Rio de JAM-eiro Jukebox - (8:34) Featuring easy access to the musical sequences from \\"Rio\\".<br />  Taio Cruz - Telling the World Music Video - (1:55) A short music video featuring Taio Cruz.<br />  Postcards from Rio - Create your own custom Rio postcard.<br />  Theatrical trailer - (2:26) Featuring the theatrical trailer for \\"Rio\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Rio\\" comes with a slipcover case but also flyers to access the Rio \\"Coloring with Blu\\" app and a secret clue for one to unlock 15 new Rio levels on \\"Angry Birds Rio\\" via iPhone, iPad or Android.  \\"Rio\\" on Blu-ray also comes with a DVD and Digital Copy edition of the film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />There was no doubt in my mind when news broke out that Twentieth Century Fox would be collaborating with Rovio for \\"Rio\\" that the film would be successful.<br /><br />It hasn't really been done before but its a true testament how the games \\"Angry Birds\\" on iPhones, Android cell phones and iPads have captured so many people's attention.  My family is absolutely addicted to the game and even to this day, they continue to play \\"Angry Birds\\", \\"Angry Birds Seasons\\" and \\"Angry Birds Rio\\".<br /><br />And for my son and my nephew, because of the tie-in with Angry Birds, before \\"Rio\\" was shown in theaters, it's all they talked about.  They had to see \\"Rio\\" and they had to play \\"Angry Birds Rio\\".<br /><br />So, the collaboration between Twentieth Century Fox and Rovio was fantastic and it's one thing to say that because the film is from the creators of \\"Ice Age\\" that the film would be a success but lately, animated films are becoming much more competitive and even the big studios have had significant misses as of late for films that they would have expected to be a blockbuster hit.<br /><br />The thing is that with today's economy and the many animated films that are available, the animated films need some major marketing push beyond fast food \\"Kids Meals\\" and the fact that \\"Angry Birds Rio\\" is still at this time a continuing game that introduces new gameplay and levels every few months, \\"Angry Birds Rio\\" is here to stay for now.<br /><br />So, it was no surprise that \\"Rio\\" did succeed in the box office, it was an incredible collaboration.<br /><br />And sure enough, Twentieth Fox and Rovio has done it once again for this Blu-ray release.  Not only do you get the Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy, there is also \\"Angry Birds\\" content and also a code to get 15 new levels for \\"Angry Birds Rio\\".  In fact, prior to my reviewing this Blu-ray release, once the title came up and Angry Birds was shown on the menu, my son and nephew went crazy and wanted to see all the \\"Angry Birds\\" content first.<br /><br />So, once again, good timing on both companies parts of collaborating once again to grab that \\"Angry Birds\\" demographic.<br /><br />With that being said, the animated film was definitely fun!  Jesse Eisenberg did a great job at providing the voice of the awkward Blu and Anne Hathaway is just a wonderful actress period and she does a great job voicing the role of Jewel.  And you also get quite a bit of talent participating in this film such as George Lopez, Jamie Foxx, Will.i.am, Wanda Sykes, Jane Lynch, Leslie Mann, Jake T. Austin, etc.<br /><br />The story is fun and enjoyable, colorful and vibrant on Blu-ray.  Also, the audio is wonderful with the music and the use of the ambiance of the environment of the jungle and Rio.<br /><br />And as for special features, there is a good number of them on Blu-ray but while they are not necessarily long, the addition of the \\"Angry Birds Rio\\" extra levels is a significant plus for the millions of hardcore fans of the game.  So, it gives people an extra incentive to purchase this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Rio\\" is a highly enjoyable, family fun animated film!

1401322336|4.0|Excellent cook book, and a good read. Simple. Straight forward. Jamie gets you thinking about taste, texture(s)and balance in a way that allows ones own inner cook to come out and play. The recipes are great! Jamie's laid back yet passionate message makes cooking approachable--a blast! Come on boys, and girls, get naked in the kitchen! I also purchased JO's Italy. Brilliant. I highly recommend JO's books to beginners through strong cooks needing to expand their repertoire, food and flavor combinations. Get cookin dudes!
0439023513|5.0|Excellent series, excellent book! I know that a lot of people don't like the ending, but given the horror of war and the nature of PTSD, there is no other ending that could possibly exist that would be realistic for Peeta or Katniss.  Any other ending would be a trite minimization of the storyline by turning the book into a simple love story set against a dark background.
1463514581|5.0|I was one of the few folks who had the opportunity to review this book as an ARC. Not being familiar with Sookie Sackhouse or any of the southern mystery genre I knew it might be a stretch for me to get into this novel and character. However, Denise Grover Swank hooked me right into the story from the first sentence! I think the first time I read it I read the whole thing in one sitting.<br /><br />The quirky southern heroin has just the right mixture of everything! Seriously, she is funny, heartwarming, angry, naive, she is like the complete character you want to root for and laugh at/with. I find myself picking up this book more then once a week and reading 2-3 chapters all over again. Just to visit Rose and her crazy Mamma.<br /><br />For a debut novel, Denise Grover Swank has set the bar high for future Rose Gardner Mysteries and any other series she chooses to share with the world (who will eagerly read).
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Quality cable, works great for connecting to an HDTV but remember different iOS devices do video-out differently.<br /><br />Full mirroring is only currently works on the iPad 2. On the iPad 1 and iPhone 4 (both of which I have) it will only display for apps that are enabled to show external video.<br /><br />Apple's site isn't terribly clear on that point, and actually, App Store app descriptions don't always mention video-out capability on the iPad 1 and iPhone 4. If the app doesn't do external video, the TV will still 'see' signal but it will be a black screen.<br /><br />Signal is clear, sharp, and aligned -- nothing like computer video adapters of old. The iPad 1 and iPhone 4 drive at 720p; the iPad 2 will do 1080p (movies still in 720p).
B004MKLRYC|4.0|Think everyday life is getting in the way of your reading? (Or is it the other way around?) If you think you have it tough, see what happens to the Queen of England when she becomes addicted to reading.<br /><br />Being short and addictively entertaining, this was one of those few books in recent memory that I finished in one sitting without even getting up for a snack or a bathroom break. The story line was well matched by the style of writing. While eloquent and charming, it was light and breezy without being overly cutesy; the humor was chuckle-worthy and not-at-all forced.<br /><br />Minus one star because the kindle version costs more than the paperback version.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|Old review:<br /><br />First, I'd like to say Congratulations! to John Locke for all his many successes. To many authors, he's a shining star of what can be accomplished. A prolific writer and a great marketer, John clearly puts a great deal of time, effort, and know-how into making his titles successful.<br /><br />After reading through the book, I'd say I'm squarely in the middle, but I don't think this book is a bad thing. In an effort to be helpful to other readers, I'll go through what the book is generally about.<br /><br />What the book's about:<br />- Using Twitter to promote in a non-spammy way.<br />- Using your blog to maximize exposure to readers.<br />- Using a mailing list to maximize sales and exposure.<br /><br />If you're already an expert on those three topics, the book is probably not for you. If you feel like you're an expert on them, but you're not getting any results, then you may very well benefit from reading about how John does it.<br /><br />Why 3-stars?<br /><br />Well, as I said, I'm squarely in the middle. About the first third of the book is a little fluffy and was skip-worthy to me for the most part, and just about all of the information there can be garnered from a basic internet search about John. It doesn't get into anything that really applies to the subject of the book until about the latter half of the second part. The third part is where the useful information crops up the most.<br /><br />In addition, I didn't see anything in there about how to get reviews - the book states you should get them, but it doesn't elaborate on the fact very much. Of course, you can use the Twitter process to possibly gain reviews as John describes, but it's not the quickest way to gain exposure to reviewers in my humble opinion. The best way to do that is, of course, to utilize book bloggers and review websites, and that was not covered here (a very important tip for anyone starting out in self-publishing). I know it did wonders for me.<br /><br />Who would benefit from this book?<br /><br />I would say the greatest benefits would be given to those who haven't written a book yet but who want to self-publish their work. Second to that, people who are brand new and just getting started can probably glean some useful information from the book. If you're already experienced with social networking and connecting on a personal basis to your readership, there is probably little you will get that you can apply to your promotion activities. Third, and last, are those who are already involved in publicity and have been given the basic run-down on the best way to do it (either by trial and error or advice by those who have been there and done it).<br /><br />In conclusion, I think John's book has much to offer to the inexperienced or struggling who really want to make this work for them. For those seeing some success, you could probably skip it and just strengthen your efforts. Do be advised that the marketing ideals set forth as the platform for the book are not brand new, they are a retelling of using social marketing to promote. John does this in a very effective, useful, and easy-to-understand way, and he lays out the steps you need to take plainly, but there need not be any illusions about the fact that it has been said many times before. I do believe, however, that the method he describes is probably the best route to being successful with social marketing.<br /><br />Again, congrats to John for all of his successes thus far and all those we know will happen for him in the future as he continues his adventures in writing!<br /><br />Updated addition to review after I learned about the fake reviews:<br /><br />Quite a shame. Very unfortunate for it to have ended this way. 1-star.ho would benefit from this book?<br /><br />I would say the greatest benefits would be given to those who haven't written a book yet but who want to self-publish their work.

0670022411|4.0|Considering the topic as one I read fairly regularly this book was a wonderful suprise. The characters not only kept me enchanted, but I am anxiously hoping for a sequel. The prose flowed nicely, the action was well-paced, and there were constantly little surprises to enjoy while traveling through this story.     I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in spending some quality time elsewhere with some outstanding characters.
B004QDCZ3M|3.0|I saw this band in concert opening for U2 and decided to buy their album after thoroughly enjoying their soaring and energetic live performance.    Unfortunately, the theatrics of their live show didn't translate as well to the studio and I found myself not liking many of the songs on this CD because they sounded too \\"noisy\\", with a lot of disparate sounding instruments that distracted from the whole sound of the songs rather than adding to them.    While this CD contains 24 tracks, many of them should have been left in the studio as they only feel tacked on to what should be a solid 10 or 11 track offering. I feel like the entire 2nd CD consisted of B-sides and cover songs that I could have lived without. Also, I was unable to play these discs in all of my media devices because they contain some kind of multimedia presentation that crashed on start-up numerous times.    Overall, this is a case of \\"too much\\" being a bad thing. However, there are 8-10 good songs on here to go along with one great song (Dog Days Are Over) and the lead singer's voice is a powerful and soaring instrument that you will enjoy listening too, even if you have to sift through some \\"noise\\" to hear it.    This group has a ton of promise and I expect great things from their next LP, but I'll probably only be listening to a handful of these tracks as I wait.
B00004YTIQ|5.0|This cover fits snugly and keeps out leaves, bugs, etc.  My least favorite part about pools is having to spend so much time cleaning them on a nice day.  A good cover cuts down on that imposition on fun time.
B002CPD5LC|5.0|The amount of talent on this video is astounding.  To review just some of the marvelous music that Quincy has written and arranged is mind boggling.  I am blown away by the gifts on this DVD, musician and vocally.  They are some of the world's best.  I am partial to Al Jarreu and James Williams, Chaka Chan, Nathan East, and Toots Thielemans, and Patty Austin.  These incredible musicians take you to places in your mind where you see colors (without being high LOL) that can only be given by God himself.  This is a great tribute to a man that is a living legend.  Thank you Quincy for sharing your talent and exposing so much talent to the world.  You have truly made your mark in the sands of time.

030745455X|4.0|Truly, you do not need to have read the previous book for this installment to make sense.  There are a few details here and there which might be murky, but Larsson does a good job of filling in the blanks.  The countryside and city themselves play less of a part here, and for that the story is lessened.  Arguably, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" suffers from middle child syndrome.  Had the Vanger story line been carried forward in a more meaningful way or had more of what was to come with Lisbeth been foreshadowed in \\"Dragon Tattoo,\\" I think it all would have felt more cohesive.  That it ends in the particular manner that it does also begs the question of how the story could possibly continue.  But it does, and you'll be dying to pick up the final book as soon as you finish this one.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater with my 13 year-old and we totally loved it!  It was action-packed and thoroughly entertaining, with lots of messages of family values.  The story was interesting and moved at a fast pace throughout. I watched the original televised shows when they first aired, and am enjoying watching the old episodes again on TV with my daughter.  We are big fans of the show, so seeing the Smurfs on the big screen was a real treat.  It follows closely to the original essence of the characters, with a few updated twists.  We heard that this may be the first of a Smurfs Trilogy, and look forward to seeing any future Smurfs adventures.  I would recommend this movie for families, and anyone who is a fan of the Smurfs.  It was Smurftastic!
0307454541|5.0|What great fun this novel was to read!  Had there been no more to the series, it still would have stood on its own.  In fact, my only criticism would be that this a needlessly long lead in to the ensuing two installments.  Such griping aside, I felt \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" fired on all cylinders: a beautifully translation, thorough immersion in a foreign culture, cleverly stylized character development, and delicious suspense.
B000W44IZW|1.0|I bought the Korean dub because I was under the impression it had the original 1988 US theatrical release music score by Bill Conti- nada. This version contains the same music score by Eric Serra that is on all the rereleased directors cut versions of the film. If you ever get a chance to see the original US release which was shortened and given a new musical score you will be delighted at the results. There is a reason they decided to do this; because in America we know how to make movies. The directors cut is awful- it distorts the character development and the musical score by Eric Serra is dreadful. It's worth mentioning that the video quality is prettty poor also. Total waste of money
030726999X|5.0|If you're on the fence after the second book, don't leave yourself in suspense.  This final installment is completely and thoroughly satisfying.  The plot lines tie up neatly without feeling contrived.  Any sympathy you may have lost for Lisbeth comes back in spades.  You do, however, need to have read the second book for this one to carry its full weight.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was as good as the other two.  It didn't go in the direction I thought it would, and although I was happy with the ending, I thought they could have even done a fourth book.  This was recommended to me by my Sister-In-Law, who is an 8th grade english teacher and used this book in her class.  I can't wait for the movie!
0553801473|2.0|*Spoilers below*<br />This book is much slower paced than the first three books and while slowing the pace down from a storm of swords is neccesscery, it really fails to keep any tension. In the previous books I yearned to see what happened next. This book fails to capture that spirit. I dreaded everytime I finished chapter and saw the name Dany, Jon or Tyrion on the next page (and tyrion use to be my favorite!). All the character's also seem to de-evolve. The hardened Dany from the death of her husband devolves into a whiny boring teenager that is painful to read about. Tyrion seems to have lost his purpose and anything interesting about him and while he still has a few ok lines they aren't nearly as funny or catchy as they are in first three. Jon starts off great but quickly lulls you into boredom with mindless repetitions of  \\"Words are wind\\" \\"Corn Corn\\", \\"you know nothing\\" until the book peaks and than nothing gets resolved.<br /><br />I loved the first three because the intrigue, the scheming  and the tension. This book fails on all three accounts (with an exception of the davos/reek chapters). If you enjoyed the books based on the actual world, lineage history or like Dany than this book would be probably worth picking up, otherwise its a a great trilogy.
B0051DSAP8|5.0|This is one of the best albums released this year by far.  The sad thing is, nobody knows about Powerwolf, and those that do will surely agree.  From beginning to end this album keeps you transported to the world where wolves feed on the blood of man.  Don't define them as solely being a power metal band, or a gothic band, or melodic metal.  They're neither, and all 3 at the same time.  Each album seems to be an improvement however; this album doesn't necessarily separate them from Bible of the Beast.  It is very consistent with their last album but branches forward to continue the saga.  A new listener wouldn't be able to distinguish the differences between them.  Blood of the Saints is the better album.<br /><br />The haunting rock riffs and organ melodies are both electrifying and chilling.  Attila Dorn delivers amazing vocals.  He alone commands this album with his power.  You'll be chanting for more blood by the album's end.<br />Sanctified with Dynamite is a fantastic beginner to the album.  It definitely sets the tone and doesn't let up from there.  Each song is excellent in its own right, no filler here.  The energy is off the scale, the talent is being fully utilized and the structure is very solid and entertaining.<br /><br />Powerwolf does not disappoint with this latest effort.  They're sticking to the formula that works and that's great for their growing fan base.  They've established their own genre of music.  It's completely original and they'll always be the standard to beat.  Check out this album along with Bible of the Beast, you'll convert for sure.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|This series is the best series that I have seen for a long time, all the writers do a great job keeping things super fresh and suspenseful.

0553801473|4.0|A Dance With Dragons continues the world building, character driven epic in the same deliberate detail as each of the previous books, so I don't quite understand some of the negative perceptions regarding the next steps in this epic journey. I think trying to coordinate the army of characters and sync the plot to literally get the stage set for the final chapters of the story was daunting for Mr. Martin, but it was still an enertaining read as the pieces aligned themselves.<br />The second half of the book was more fun as the other characters caught up with the A Feast for Crows timeline.  The audience is still treated to a story of a scope and scale rarely attempted, even for epic high fantasy.  Without throwing any substantive spoilers, it was great to spend time on the Wall with my favorite bastard, to travel along with Tyrion and watch the Dragons grow up some more. I look forward to the next book.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This game works great on my Samsung Galaxy S T959V from T-Mobile.<br /><br />The game is a shoot em up type game using a left control pad to move and a right control pad to shoot in that direction. You run around a board and try and kill all the zombies and then take on the boss. The game moves through time so you take on mummies, samurai, robots, dinosaurs, etc.<br /><br />You get a standard gun with unlimited ammo. During the game, new weapons drop that have limited ammo you can use. These weapons include a sniper, flame thrower, shotgun, oozy type guns, buzz saw, etc. You also get projectiles to use such as grenades, rockets, turrets, etc. An extra guy drops occasionally as well. You have limited lives to use to defeat the level or you will have to start the level again.<br /><br />The game didn't take me that long to finish but it was fun.<br /><br />I got this on free app of the day from Amazon. Not sure if I would have paid for it. The wifi download didn't take that long but I guess that depends on your wifi strength.

B005529BDK|5.0|This is a unique game. It works fine on my Samsung Galaxy S T959V from T-Mobile.<br /><br />The game:  The board is 6 coins wide. Each coin has 2 colors, one on each side. Your object is to get a minimum of 3 coins of the same color in a row. Any connecting coins of the same color will also be removed. You can turn over coins to try and connect more colors. A new row continues to descend from the top and if any of the coins get below the green line at the bottom, the game ends.<br /><br />Modes: there are 2 difficulty settings: easy and hard. There is also a demo mode that you can use once to understand the game, and then turn it off. There are 4 game modes: endless, score attack, time attack, drop attack. In endless, you just go until you die. In score attack, you have 90 seconds to put up your best score. In time attack, you have to clear 250 tiles as quick as possible. In drop attack, you have 90 seconds to score as many as possible. Not sure what the difference is between drop attack and score attack.<br /><br />Graphics: Not bad for an app. You get to pick a character and they move at the bottom and react based on your moves, but it seems pointless.<br /><br />Overall, great game. Fun for a short time.

B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Everybody knows that Star Trek: First Contact is widely considered the best of the TNG films, and also probably one of the better Star Trek movies overall. I won't add much more except to say that the movie works so well because it blends the best of Star Trek - humor, action, and a morality play - into one package. The film has some genuinely funny moments, especially when Drs. Cochrane and Lilly are forced to adapt to 24th century technology and expectations.     Given its reputation as an action-packed battle against the Borg, there aren't that many action sequences in First Contact, but those that are included are deliberate, emotionally tense, and advance the plot. Jonathan Frakes (also William Riker) made some interesting decisions in portraying the fighting scenes. Often, the best moments occur just before or after the battles start, when the Borg seem indomitable. Unfortunately, the producers learned the wrong lessons from First Contact's success and overdosed on the action scenes in Insurrection and Nemesis (which actually has its moments, despite the action scenes).     Finally, First Contact contains two morality plays. The first focuses on Picard's thirst for revenge against the Borg. The second disabuses viewers of the notion that historical visionaries need have a saintly persona. Dr. Zefram Cochrane, the inventor of the warp drive, comes across as a self-absorbed alcoholic. However, as viewers learn to readjust their expectations to fit the man, Cochrane also comes to realize that he can be a man and be part of history.    It's a shame that nearly 10 years after the last TNG film aired First Contact is really the only TNG film that stands as unanimously beloved. Despite what many producers and market analysts claim, it's not simply because First Contact uses the Borg and time travel as plot devices - although both work well. Rather, it's because it combines the best of Star Trek. Hopefully future Star Trek movies will learn these lessons.

B00271DNP4|4.0|This movie is actually pretty happy-go-lucky. No visits from Voldermort is quite the rarity. However after about 1.5hrs it is painful that the plot then turns into Back to the Future meets Groundhog Day. It's a pretty crucial film in terms of the overall series, and there are some pretty big family tree clues for Harry, that are important to know for later on. The Marauder's Map is great fun and it seems like this film is the last edition that Harry and his mates are allowed to be kids.

0740797719|5.0|Let me begin by saying that this is not your average \\"how-to\\" book on painting. This book delves into the world of painting with extensive precision, revealing enormous detail and James Gurney delivers this wealth of information brilliantly. \\"Light and Color: A Guide for the Realist Painter\\" explores areas of painting that are absolute essentials for any painter.    Have you ever said to yourself, \\"I read so many books and tutorials, yet I never get better\\"? Well I have, many times. I noticed that most books and tutorials only approach the outward aspects of painting--such as systematic ideas and step-by-step methods--never exploring the core fundamentals. While most tutorials successfully teach you the \\"process\\" of painting, most of the time they never really teach you \\"how\\" to apply those individual concepts to your own work.    In any case, I was desperately looking for a way to polish my work. \\"Light and Color: A Guide for the Realist Painter\\" delivered on so many levels. The information on lighting effects and color theory are simply perfect. I am not disappointed with my purchase. I have bought many painting books before arriving to this one and needless to say, I found the book that I was looking for. Whether you are a hobbyist, a student, or even an expert, I am sure that you will find an abundance of needful information in this book.

The HBO mini-series of the first book was true to the book.  However, you don't  want to read the books at the beach or by the pool as the glue is cheap and the  books fall apart.  I ended up holding the pages together while gingerly reading  the rest of the books.  It happened with the first two books (so far).

0060557818|4.0|London is about as normal as it gets, and Richard Mayhew, resident for the past three years since moving south from Scotland, is also about as normal as it gets. He lives in an average flat, has an average job with average ambitions, and is engaged to be married. He is just as normal as the city itself.  London Above that is. London Below, is a completely different story.<br /><br />Richard's story begins when, on his way to an important dinner with his fiance, he discovers an injured girl huddled on the sidewalk. In an act of great sympathy he takes her to his flat, after unsuccessfully trying to talk her into going to the hospital. It is then that his whole world turns upside down and finally he falls through a crack, landing in a whole other London than the one he knows. London Below.<br /><br />Inspired by the BBC series of the same name, Neverwhere is an inventive story that is clever, dark, and humorous - all qualities I have come to expect from Neil Gaiman. His characters are unique - Door, the girl who can open any door; de Carabas, the marquis who will complete any job for you provided you're willing to owe him a really big favor; Hunter, the bravo who stalks Underside nightmares; and quite possibly the best pair of villains I've ever come across, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandamer. The idea that there is an invisible world to mirror our own, right under our feet, is an intriguing twist, melding both urban and pure fantasy. This was a fun and entertaining read; I only wish there was a sequel so that I could find out what happens after the Door shuts.
140130916X|4.0|This is the story of a women widowed much to early in life and her husband left behind notes to help her move on with her life.  I could relate to a lot of what Holly was going through and the book was very well written.  I was hesitant to read because I do not normally watch the movie before reading the book and thought I would be disappointed.  It was really very good!  There were moments that were sad and others that were so funny that you had to laugh.  It wasn't your typical sappy story it explores how Holly's relationship with everyone changed once Gerry passed away.  Definitely worth reading.
0061784788|5.0|It is so difficult to write a review of this novel, really almost any thriller, without some spoilers, but I'll endeavor to do my best. The novel opens on a Ute Indian Reservation in southeastern Utah. Two young men, boys really, are off on their last adventure, before the circumstances of college and life send their lives in two different directions. It is an adventure that can come to no good conclusion. This sets of a bomb, literal and figurative, that explodes to through the historical and scientific communities and personally draws Painter Crowe, director of Sigma Force, to question everything we know about the founding of America, it's prehistory, and the cutting edge technology of nanotechs.<br /><br />I've said before that I am not a fan of this genre, and I'm not, with one glaring exception, James Rollins. He manages to put together plots and sub-plots, characters and story elements that just don't belong together. In the hands of anyone else this story would have been a disaster, completely unbelievable. Yet Rollins pulls it off masterfully. From the very first page you are pulled into a story that spans from across continents and time. The action is tight and fast-paced, and the characters fully likable, even the villains surpass the usual stereotypes. With each book he writes, the stories just get better. I can't recommend this author enough, and this book is the best of the lot.

Not long after release of this book, tons of blog posts, illegal translations are flooding my RSS reader. This is phenomenal. And it haven't happened for a long time. The big heads - Tech Crunch, Business Insider and Mashable - also have at least one post on the book. They also reminded me to purchase a copy to fill my little monster of curiosity.<br />So this is it. I paid $12.99 to get a copy. Thanks to Amazon's kindle reader. I can get hands on the book in less than five minutes. If I place an order to a printed copy, I have to wait, like two weeks.<br />In my opinion, all the interesting gossips in this book have been leaked by the bloggers. Nothing more. Google has a hiding strategy. They have a lot stories hidden, which should be publicly known. That's why we have to buy a history book on Google. As Steven Levy wrote on Quora, this book has approved by Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt. Google even gave Steven a unprecedented access.<br />But some engineers think Google is no longer cool. A few left the company from Mountain View to Palo Alto. The most shocking big one is Sheryl Sandberg, who was a key person for Google ad division. She left Google for Facebook in March of 2008. It is hard to say Facebook is the future of internet, or social network will kill search engine. Yet, you know what I mean :)<br />In any aspect, Google is a great company.

0142000671|3.0|I'm not sure that this story even needs a synopsis, as it is so well known. However, for the sake of completeness I will attempt to provide such. George and Lennie are drifters moving from job to job in an attempt to save enough money to buy their own piece of land. Men on of their sort were common enough during the Great Depression, and much of the novel is based off Steinbeck's own experiences as a bindlestiff in the 1920s. Lennie was simple-minded and relied almost completely upon George. It was this very simpleness that had them constantly moving from town to town, and ranch to ranch. And in the end it was this simpleness that would destroy their plans, just as they were about to come to fruition.<br /><br />I've been told time and time again that I needed to read this novella, that it was powerful and moving. I really felt sorry for Lennie and though I didn't like George, I respected him for taking care of his friend. Perhaps my favorite character was Candy, the one-handed cripple they meet at their last job. Yet I wasn't moved by it in the way that I expected. Perhaps my expectations were just too high or perhaps I just needed more as at just over 100 pages, this was a very short book.<br /><br />The novel was very simply written, which I think suited the characters and the setting. I believe that it was Faulkner who said that you wouldn't need a dictionary to read Steinbeck, and I don't know that I've ever heard a more accurate description, though I don't think that it's necessarily as insulting as Faulkner intended it to be. A book doesn't have to be populated with words and techniques that no one else understands to be good, though I admit to rather enjoying that sort of literary novel. Steinbeck relied more on the truth and reality of his subjects to stand the test of time, and they have.

And how much.\\"<br /><br />This quote, more than anything I could write, tells the reader what they will find on the pages of this hauntingly tragic novel. I could tell you the plot points, and I will, but nothing I say will better describe The God of Small Things then those few words.<br /><br />There is an innocence to childhood. Usually that innocence fades slowly, shed as the child grows into first adolescence and then into adulthood. Other times that innocence is ripped away, quick and painful - this is what happened to fraternal twins, Rahel and Estha. Their childhood was a lonely one, growing up in the southernmost province of India, the tip that juts into the sea. Their mother was divorced, bringing shame to her family. Their father was a violent drunkard, whom they knew nothing about, outside of a picture in which they clung to him, their mothering hovering just outside the frame to catch them should he suddenly drop them. The rest of the household was made up of their vitriolic grandaunt (who once loved a priest and nurtured her disappointment like a venomous snake), their communist Oxford-educated uncle (also divorced, but his of course bringing no shame), their blind grandmother (who delivered all her wifely baggage to her son's care the day stopped his father from killing her), and the ghost of their grandfather (also trapped in disappointment and anger, though his was came from a moth with unusually dense dorsal tufts). There was another. An Untouchable. A man who had obtained an unusual importance within the family circle. Unthinkable. Echos of this allowance would be felt Later. Lay Ter.<br /><br />This novel is beautiful, haunting, tragic. It is the story of childhood lost, it is the story of love, it is the story of death. The story unwinds slowly, with a deep sense of foreboding, the author leaving hints of what is to come. Despite the almost painfully slow telling of the story, the way it meanders back in forth in time, it is never plodding. The author, recreating language as it suits her, as she needs to, strings you along, inviting you to keep reading, to find out lies within the book's Heart of Darkness. Dark of Heartness. I was captivated from the very first page, and even though the author leaves a trail of breadcrumbs for you to follow, even though you know what is going to happen, in the end, when it does, you're still not prepared.ow telling of the story, the way it meanders back in forth in time, it is never plodding.

He also had a lingering and internal resentment of his family - both for their wealth and love of the material which he found to be valueless and deeper personal issues surrounding his and his sister's early childhood. In addition his was enamored with the works of Tolstoy, Thoreau, and Jack London and sought to emulate them. Oddly enough he was able to forgive and even overlook the faults of his heros when he could not forgive those who loved him most.<br /><br />Following McCandless' graduation from Emory he announced to his family that he would be spending the summer on a cross-country road trip. As he had completed such journey's previously, this was met without surprise. It was expected that in August he would be attending law school. He did not return in August. There was no phone call, no letter, not even a postcard to inform his family that he instead intended to travel around the country as a \\"rubber-tramp.\\" He spent the next two years doing just that, eventually ditching his trusty Datsun in the desert, abandoning all his possessions except those he could carry on his back, and burning all his cash. He traversed all across the American West, even crossing Baja in a canoe. He seemed to charm and leave and indelible impression on just about every person he met. This quest culminated in a journey into the Alaskan wild, where he lived out of an abandoned bus, utterly isolated, surviving entirely on his wits and what he could hunt or scavenge. Four months later, six back-country hunters and hikers converged on the bus he had made his base camp, discovering his emaciated corpse accompanied by a haunting plea for help.<br /><br />McCandless' story was at once both awe-inspiring and a cautionary lesson. In the beginning I found myself regularly shaking my head over what seemed to be a utter lack of common sense and compassion. By the end, I was amazed at his convictions and resilience. Reading the biography, I was not blown away by Krakauer's writing. I'm still not sure I am. However, it must have got to me, or maybe it was just Chris McCandless who did. I really get what drove him to wander the deserts and frontiers of Western North America. I understand his desire to be who he wants to be and not a slave to societal or familial expectations. I admire him for actually doing it. But at the same time he made some very selfish choices and foolish mistakes. I get wanting to spend time in solitude, reliant only upon yourself, but to trek into the Alaskan wild without the benefit of a compass, map, or radio is downright foolhardy. It was these foolish choices that ultimately cost him his life. Some condemn him for being a brash, arrogant and stupid youth, while others like Krakauer, seem to treat him as a modern day hero. I think the truth, as is often the case, can be found somewhere in between.urviving entirely on his wits and what he could hunt or scavenge.

B002RVZV9K|5.0|I had not heard Jack White, except briefly in Glastonbury Festival DVD as White Stripes with his sister Meg on drums. I knew Page of course & everyone knows Bono. I believe the previews were exactly what was delivered, and then some. I loved the behind-the-scenes footage, especially showing White building a guitar on a piece of wood using ONE wire and a coke bottle to play it, while a cow lazily chews its cud next to him in a rural field in England! I could immediately tell that not only had White done his homework by studying from the masters of blues, he had talent the likes of which we rarely see (eg. Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmy Hendrix). The video does seem to focus more on White & Page second, very little of Bono before the jam session.<br /><br />What's interesting is that as Page was playing guitar, he made the exact same facial expressions he did over 30 years ago in Song Remains the Same live performance, I watched both the same week, and noticed he hasn't changed how much he LOVES playing guitar, or his passion about music. The 3 men meet on a built-up stage similar to a wresting ring without the rope, up off the main floor. Each has his little setup, equipment, effects hardware & guitars, amps, etc. At 1st they all stay in their own little areas, but as they start to play, one by one, they each get excited about what the other can do, wanting to learn from each other, as in \\"I always wondered how you did that\\". Bono is the most humble it seems, as he keeps telling us if it weren't for his effects pedals, he'd be playing a repeated boring bass guitar sound--anything BUT boring, either way. We get to see how Bono makes the sounds & the fact that he plays differently EVERY time. Of course, both younger axe men get the most excited when Page plays, truly in awe and wanting to learn some tricks of the trade--in fact all 3 share numerous tips & secrets, with each other, & us vicariously.<br /><br />For those who love jam sessions, when anything can & does happen musically, when 3 of the greatest guitarists get together, it's music heaven. The viewer feels as if present with them, just as excited as they are to play, and as we are to hear the original music these three make TOGETHER, jamming & truly loving what they are doing, which shows through all they do on this film.<br /><br />There was NO script, that's why the lead up was suspenseful, because no one knew what to expect, throwing 3 greats in a room on a stage together with NO direction, no goal, just It MIGHT Get Loud, and it doesn't take long for them to develop a rapport. The initial nervousness may have been a result of the self-doubt many (even famous!) artists feel about their work, and wondering how they will be judged by musicians they believe are BETTER than they are, which may or may not be true, it's a mindset of humility in the presence of someone they admire & respect, perhaps even emulate. This is true of Page, for the up & comers, as it is for the newer musicians. No egos get in the way of a fantastic, one of a kind, never to be repeated, jam session experience. :-) One will never regret buying this DVD/movie, for it will be watched with the same pleasure repeatedly over the years. Plus, how long has it been since we've heard ANY thing LIVE from Led Zeppelin? Too long! Here's your chance to see & hear Page in his element, the same goes for all of them, as they soon forget the cameras, the audience, everything but the music. However, this is one experience WE will never forget.3 of the greatest guitarists get together, it's music heaven.

1897093616|5.0|\\"15 men on a dead man's chest...Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum\\"<br /><br />Jim Hawkins is the young son of a poor innkeeper when he meets his first pirate, Billy Bones, who has holed up at the Admiral Benbow, trying to avoid his death at the hands of his fellow gentlemen o' fortune. His fate has already been sealed though and the pirates set upon the inn with violence, seeking the map that leads to Cap'n Flint's treasure. However, in an attempt to make good Billy's debt, Jim has already stolen away with it, not knowing what it is. When he finally learns what he has, he along with Squire Trelawney, Doctor Livesey, Long John Silver, and a mutinous crew depart from the port of Bristol in search of treasure.<br /><br />This is the classic pirate story from which all others follow. Without Treasure Island where would Pirates of the Caribbean be? I adored this story from start to finish. It was easy read, written as it was for a younger audience, but it was just so much fun that it didn't matter. Having previously seen movie adaptations of the story, I already knew what to expect, or thought I did. I certainly didn't expect to enjoy the adventure as much as I did. I read it in two sittings and went to bed dreaming of pirates and treasure. I can see exactly why it is such a favorite of young boys and why the pirate, cruel though most of these were, remains such a romantic figure in the collective psyche.
B001UOVP1S|5.0|It's been a long time since I've heard something that makes me silent for more. I'm the kind of girl that likes a little of all types music and Scream for me is just soo powerful at times. I don't love all the songs, but the ones I do..omg..it's like hearing the silence between very loud, consecutive heartbeats. It's as if the world had no sun or light to speak of but you've got this warmness that shatters all fear. I don't care who hates it, I freaking love this thing.

1416583408|1.0|Horowitz seems more interested in trying to impress the reader with her large vocabulary and technical psycho babel of a shrink/scientist/dog therapist. I suppose it's a great book for those standing around a pompous Manhattan cocktail party trying to show their pseudo spiritualty by understanding dog behavior. I thought of getting a book of light reading for a vacation, but I felt as I was reading a technical manual on dog anatomy and psychology that was also overly wordy. Horowitz seems to have forgotten to write on a level that appeals to the buyer. Not that everyone is a comic book level reading idiot, but I would like to read a book without having to take a brush up vocabulary course and medical, latin dictionaries and lexicons with me on the cruise ship to read a book. But then I'm just a working class structural engineer who is not a member of Horowitzs' cocktail kudo book club. I don't need the latin word for a rat and clinical studies data as relates to a dog. The book was marginally informative and I could have cleaned it up if I could have edited it and saved half the trees needed for paper. I think she would have done better to have a sit down with Cesar Millan the dog whisperer over a 12$ Manhattan Starbuck mocha blah blah blah latte to get a little human interest and rubber meets the road understanding in her book. Maybe the dog licks my lips as a ancient pack greeting or for some primal vomit ceremony but I think my dogs like the taste of Costco hot dog. Sorry but I'm returning the book ASAP so it can make it on time for the next shipment to the dollar store clearance rack. P.S. The dog pic on the cover was the best thing about the book.
B0051BNXNE|3.0|Darcy was born beautiful.  Really... it's true.  Just ask her.  She will be the first to tell you that she is perfect.  She loves that men find her attractive so it's no big surprise that she is stunned to find that her fiance friend Marcus takes work.  Oh but never fear, Darcy continues to work her magic until she gets her way... only to be truly shocked and offended when she finds out fer fiance Dex, has also found his way to another... her best friend Rachel.<br /><br />Oh the nerve of some people!  While yes, Darcy to has cheated with Marcus (more than once but really who is counting) she is still appalled to think that Dex and Rachel had done the unthinkable to her.  Yes... once again it is all about Darcy...<br /><br />and as the title suggests....<br /><br />she turns out to be pregnant with Marcus's child... a child he does not want... and in fact he's pretty tired of Darcy's uppity ways as well.  Darcy quickly finds herself without a place to stay, so she packs her bags and goes to London to stay with her writer friend Ethan... only the life lessons continue as Ethan's flat isn't \\"all that\\" and he is not about to put up with selfish behavior.<br /><br />Oh whats a girl to do.... and a pregnant one at that....<br /><br />Occasionally I enjoy a bit of a fluff read.  Just a fun, no thinking involved read.  When I found this audio on Amazon I thought I would give this audio a try.  A series of emotions came forth as I listened to this audio:<br /><br />disbelief<br /><br />annoyance<br /><br />horrified<br /><br />disgusted<br /><br />cautiously optimistic<br /><br />passive<br /><br />accepting<br /><br />Ugghhh.... it's almost like the stages of grief.  :razz:  I started out not liking Darcy at all.  Really there was nothing to like.  She is an extremely self-centered character who only cared about making sue all men had eyes only for her, always wanting what she could not have until she got it... and then drinking while pregnant just about pushed me over the edge.  Fictional character or not, I was about to take Darcy out.<br /><br />Then.... slowly.... she began to change, in an almost predictable way, she learns the errors of her ways and well... you will just have to read it to see exactly what that means.<br /><br />This is the sequel to Something Borrowed which I have not read.  ( I heard it was a movie and I was going to try to see it before I listened to this audio but I did not... I still may watch it at some point.) However I don't think I missed anything by diving into this one, the characters were easy to figure out where they stood.<br /><br />In recap.... I didn't hate it.  It actually grew on me a bit.  Not so much as I would pursue the series, but in the end I may have been able to have lunch with Darcy without stabbing her in the neck with my fork.change, in an almost predictable way, she learns the errors of her ways and well... you will just have to read it to see exactly what that means.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|First, the good. The writing is good. I'm interested in these characters, so seeing things happen to them, anything happen to them, is interesting enough to read. The characters are all still real. Also, there were some interesting twists and revelations.<br /><br />Now the bad. I guess part of it is that this is the long boring middle. Every story has one. Eventually when the plans of your characters reach a pause, there's then a fight back and your characters have to react. That's fine. But the problem here is GRRM has forgotten what drama is.<br /><br />Drama happens when characters actively DO things to CHANGE circumstances. In all the other books, even A Feast for Crows, characters were making plans and trying to see them come to fruition. Some plans were noble. Some evil. Some worked. Some didn't. Some are short lived. Some are for the long game. But they did things. In A Dance with Dragons none of our characters are doing anything. Theon, Tyrion, Dany, Asha, etc. They're all just reacting. They're eating the dirt-sandwiches GRRM is feeding them. The only narrative character who's actually trying to see a plan to its conclusion is Jon, and he is lost and a victim of circumstance most of the time anyway.<br /><br />What's left over is a book that doesn't really begin and doesn't really end. I'm actually baffled at what took so long to write, because nothing really wraps up. No problem is solved. Nothing really switches gears. The story just stops. I wonder if the editors said \\"Forget it. You're done. Next book.\\"<br /><br />GRRM would have been better served to either have his characters enact new plots, even if they fail, or hand the narrative over to the people who are actually doing things. The Boltons, Stannis, the Yunkai'i, some of the Nights Watch characters. Because I want to see people doing things!<br /><br />This book makes the worst mistake an author can make. Not only writing a boring book, but a book that hints at a much better story that could have been told.<br /><br />It's worth the money, but if you've waited five years already, wait another five months or so for the paperback.been told.<br /><br />It's worth the money, but if you've waited five years already, wait another five months or so for the paperback.

I don't see what was so disagreeable in this book, but that is why we have both vanilla and cholate ice cream isn't it?

0765324857|5.0|As a fan of all things Bioshock, it could be said that my opinions in this review are biased.  But as an admirer of dystopian novels, I can say that the difference between this book and others is when the story actually takes place.<br /><br />Many books in this genre start around the time of the downfall of the society or when it's already spiraling out of control.  Here with Bioshock: Rapture, you get to experience the rise of a perfect society and its inevitable fall.<br /><br />With any prequel, it is a difficult task to craft a story that interlocks with what has already been laid out, without disrupting it.  Thankfully, the story from the first two games was so incredible and detailed, that it left plenty of rich material to work with.  But it's what you do with it that really makes the difference and I feel John Shirley pulled it off very nicely.<br /><br />Understanding the potential concern of there being too many point-of-views in the story, I'm not sure how else it could have worked without going the route of using a narrator.  The structure (chapters consisting of multiple POVs and including location and time stamps) worked for me and the pace was gradual and not overwhelming.<br /><br />At first, I felt some of the characters could have used some depth, but after finishing the book, it seemed to me that it was no longer important, since Rapture itself was the main focus, not the inhabitants.<br /><br />To sum up: the story was very well done from beginning to end and it wasn't hard to keep track of what was going on.  Adding frequent bits of information for the fans was a nice treat (some `ah-ha' moments), but they still would make sense for those who have no knowledge of Bioshock.  The story gets quite violent at times, which was to be expected.  All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed John Shirley's take of the Bioshock series.<br /><br />Even though I read it electronically, I purchased the print book shortly thereafter and will likely reread.  Please excuse me while I play the first Bioshock again......
B0057A6GA6|3.0|Great game, graphics decent, controls are simple, it gets challenging. I had to reinstall due to a fc issue.\nBigger problem though, and reason why I gave it three stars, why does it need my phone calls and logs access? I suspect something fishy is going on, and I dislike data mining on MY calls.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I came across these books by happenstance a few months ago. I was very excited about the first three books.  Then it came to a halt. My very first impression after reading the fourth book was is this author another Robert Jordan in the making.  For me, it was a two week wait for the fifth book A Dance with Dragons.  I can't imagine how agonizing it was for the die-hard fans that waited five years. What a disappointment.  The story has stalled. The author could have combined the last two books into about a third and still had room for yet another character.  I say this with sarcasm. Seriously, this series- does it need another character?
B0055CJ8T2|5.0|I absolutely love this album, you can literary put the cd in an not even turn the song that you're listening to, I purchased her last album, Miss Kelly it was also good but this one is GREAT!:)
B00005JNX0|5.0|Madagascar is a great movie to own.  My lil one loves to watch this over and over.  Personally I like Madagascar 2 better than the first one but they are both really good movies and would suggest owning them.  We love to watch them again and again.
B004EPYZU8|1.0|This is a movie for teenage boys who live in a fantasy world of video games and porn. Great special effects, but a story line that jumps around more than a water bug.    Borrow it from a \\"Sucker\\" who bought it, and then only if you have watched every other video in your personal library, the public library, your church library and the bargin bin at Wal-Mart.     Maybe you can get a corporate training film, or a video you watched in drivers training.  Avoid this movie. Unless you like that one hot chick in it. :) Then turn the sound down.    I wish I could give negative stars for this waste.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|The DVD was really cool because I never got to see the rev live. The CD has all sorts of stuff from old style to new but my favorite was definitely Dancing Dead for the suspense that built up to the solo. Almost Easy and Afterlife are pretty much the same i think? I can't tell the difference. My least favorite song was walk (I hate pantera, there's no need to cover them).
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is a great application, i recommend this to those are already comfortable typing on a touch screen. Worth the $3.99, and purchased the tablet version also.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoyed playing this to waste time. Some games seem impossible but some are quite fun. Then the update, what the heck?! Erases all progress! Major disappointment but I admit i&apos;ll still play. Would be nice to have sd option. Please don&apos;t update like this again!
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I watched this movie without the slightest clue what it was going to be about.  I picked it randomly.  But maybe it wasn't as random as I thought.  I don't want to ruin anything for someone who hasn't seen it.  Personally, I loved this movie.  When things get \\"twisted\\".....I shouted out, like the little boy from the Incredible's, \\"W I C K E D\\"!  This movie needs credit alone for just being \\"out of the norm\\".  I feel exhausted  from so many of the newer movies that are spilling  with over-stimulation from too many graphics and special effects.....and sometimes I'm tired of so many \\"see-it-coming-a-mile-away\\" comedies.....and maybe a bit bored with the warmed-over love story.      This movie might lend a person to contemplate some of the \\"special\\" things that happen in their own life.  Maybe unexplainable things that make your pulse race or things you know deep down without any way to explain why you know.  There are probably plenty of people who won't really \\"get\\" this movie and that's okay...but those who do...will surely appreciate the effort.  Do I think life happens exactly like this movie? NO....but I think it's somewhere in the ballpark.  I believe anything that strikes the human cord and prompts you to examine your own life is well worth it.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who believes the truth will be stranger than fiction!
1451629184|5.0|I'm known for not reading long books. I'm 36 and the longest book I've ever read was around 200 pages & it took me weeks to finish. I got so caught up in this book I read it in two days. I feel like I know her (jaycee). I live in the city next to the one she was kept prisoner in. Just breaks my heart all that was going on so close to home & I/we couldn't help her.
1932100660|5.0|This is one of the most impactful books I've ever read, and I'm grateful it was written. This book will leave the information clear for you to make your own *informed* decisions. Without the solid science documented here, relying just on the food industry run USDA, understanding what it takes to be healthy is like finding your way out of a maze of mirrors. Get ready to dive deep into the science of health and disease.    Not only is nutrition and disease discussed, but also why we knew what we thought we knew beforehand. Secrets of the food industry manipulation of the USDA are discussed with first hand experience. One should be able to expect their government to inform them of the healthiest way to eat, instead of folding to the corruptive tactics and money of agribusiness. You must know for yourself how to stay healthy. The US government is not your ally in this quest.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I was a bit skeptical in throwing out this kind of money just so I could listen to my games in a different way, but I must say that I am shocked with the performance.  I put this headset on in a testrun on Crysis 2 and could not believe my ears.  It seemed that my gaming world was opened to basically a new sense.  I was shocked by how powerful these headphones were and how they boosted bass that my new vizio tv could not do alone.  This is a wonderful piece of equipment and I could possibly be a turtlebeach fan for life. (at least through my 4 years in college)
B004K4AUZW|4.0|I'll keep this short, since I'm sure dozens of other reviews have been written. I enjoy about 90% of Lady GaGa's songs; in fact a few of my favorites are the non-radio-airplay accoustic/acapella stuff.  Unlike many other big female diva names, she can actually sing a straight note without autotune being involved, and plays a mean piano instead of merely strutting around the stage.I say this as a person who did a little research before listening, and actually as a fan who didn't WANT to be a fan. The few songs I don't like are really just about the 'sound' and mood of them. It's rare for me to find an artist where I like 100% of their work. All that being said, Born This Way is a solid addition to the discography; I think it helps if you put the weird videos out of your mind when listening. I like the one for Judas, but not Born This Way, but I like both songs.  A few of the ones near the end of the CD fade into the background if you're not paying attention, but overall I'm glad I picked this album up.
B0057A6GA6|1.0|Am I playing the same version that the 5 star reviewers did? This game is terrible.  The story, graphics, sound, gameplay, balancing... they&apos;re all rushed and amateur.
159514188X|5.0|Have you read this book yet?  If your answer is no, then why not?<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why is one of those books that you read that leaves a lasting impression on you once you are done..  I personally have recommended it to pretty much everyone who has asked me the question \\"do you have any recommendations for a good book to read?\\" in the past month and a half.  In fact, I sent my copy home with one of my assistants when she went on vacation.  This is one of those books that I wish they would make part of the regular high school curriculum.  There is so much to be learned from this book and so much relevance to a teenager's life, no matter what decade it happens to be.  I wish this book had been around when I was in high school.  It would have explained so much to not only me, but my peers as well.<br /><br />Not everyone who reads this book will like it.  In fact some will hate it and some will tell you that it's not believable.  In my opinion, they are missing the point.<br /><br />For me, the book wasn't so much about suicide as it was about demonstrating the consequences of of our actions.  To me, the book was about the fact that we are all connected as people and have the ability to influence each others lives, good or bad.  The book was about recognizing that what seems like it's no big deal to you and me, can mean the world to someone else.  The book at it's core, for me, is about recognizing that my actions and my words just aren't about me and that they have the ability to hurt or to  heal; enlighten or deceive.<br /><br />That is the reason why I will read this book again and again and continue to recommend it to anyone who asks.
0439023521|5.0|I could not put this book down! I've read the series 3 times now and will probably read them all again. I love all the suspense! BEST BOOK SERIES EVER!!! If you loved Harry Potter then you'll love these as much if not more! The only thing that you want to take caution with is the violence. There is blood and gore in this book, so if you get scared easily (and I mean REALLY easily), this may not be for you. If you are into Sci-Fi, suspense and even some romance, you will love this book almost as much as I do!!!
B004HZ76FQ|4.0|I am not a big gamer on my phone. I am more into using more productivity, media, and other apps that enhance the phone's ability to perform. Call me a power user if you like. That said- I thoroughly enjoy playing BSF3D. It is actually a lot of fun to play when I have extra time on my hands. The best part is that you can take pics of your largest catches and send them to friends to show them your trophy from the ocean. The responsiveness is pretty good, though I have to shake the device extremely hard to sink in the bite. Otherwise, great job!

030746363X|5.0|As the author of The Three Diets Solution and The Path To Mindful Eating: Overcoming Emotional Eating and Adapting The Weight Loss Mindset, I have studied diets and dieting, health, psychology, fitness, and yet, this book, still had some information that I hadn't thought of, or figured out.  It's real gift was in the work out sections.  However, after testing the diet, that too was wonderful.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I am tired of reading the negative reviews that come up from people who portray themselves as experts, because they're doctors or physical trainers.  My parents spent 17 thousand dollars of their own money to help me lose weight, by taking me to every physician, dietician, nutrtionist out there (included trips to Boston, Maine, New York, Georgia, and Chicago)--I refused to do fat camps or away camps.  But, at 13 I weighed 240 pounds.  I was able to slow my weight down, that at 17 I weighed 280 pounds.  I tried atkins, I tried Jenny Craig, I tried Weight Watchers, I tried South Beach, I tried The Zone, I tried the Bible Diet, I had meals prepared for me by the dietician standards.  At 17, I became a vegetarian and only drank water, and ran for 2 miles a day... I went from 280 to 347 in six months.  Physical Trainers are morons, Doctors are even worse, eat right and exercise, I did that, it didn't work.<br /><br />That's when I found the work of Tom Venuto, he introduced me to NLP, and NLP led me to modeling... and modeling led me to creating a diet almost of perfect similarity to Mr. Ferris... adding Mr. Ferris's techniques in the book, now restarting the diet, I have lost 22 pounds of fat in my first month, so noticeable, my jeans barely fit.  Do you want results, or quacks who say it goes against their teaching and he doesn't understand the science so it's impossible.<br /><br />I have a sticker on my wall that says, Those Who Say It Cannot Be Done, Shouldn't Interrupt The People Who Are Doing It!  That's what these negative reviews are.  With the exception of one or two, none of them have tried the diet, or the work out, or the orgasm, and simply mock it for what they perceive as not working.  I'm 23 years old, I'm skeptical and question everything, I research everything I put into my body, and I wouldn't promote a diet for any other reason than it works.  I was fat, I tried everything, and I can guarantee you that this diet works if you work it... it's not complete, there are several things that should be added to it--such as a slow reintegration to minimal carbohydrates (about 10% of your calories coming from carbs would be a good thing--through slow reintegration), fruits--adding fruits into a diet... not daily, he's right about that, but the sugar in fruits stimulates insulin naturally, and on certain days having (20% of your calories come from fruit can be a good thing--again through slow reintegration).  I can say for a fact that none of these will stop your fat loss.<br /><br />Also, what he calls binging, work out experts, like Tom Venuto, call Cycling, and, it should be mentioned--though it's not--that you need to eat throughout the whole day... the one mistake of a binger is to have a huge meal and then not eat for the rest of the day... a binge should persist of you eating on the same schedule you eat weekly, but just much higher caloric meal or meals--this will significantly trick your body even more, because, the next day, as its preparing for the high caloric intake, and it receives the same ole treatment, it will not know what to do and start feeding on the previous fat.  Also, he doesn't mention long binges, if your weight loss plateus... gaining weight to lose it is a very quick and efficient way to jump off a plateu.  Such as going three or four days of startegic high caloric eating--carbohydrates, dairy, and low amounts of sweets--but sweets--then going right back down to your previous low caloric, no dairy, no carbs--restarting the diet from the beginning and restarting your metabolism.  B Vitamins are also incredibly useful.<br /><br />Is the book everything, of course not, is there much more that can be added, yes, I've given a few examples of things I've learned along the way in my own dieting, but does it have thousands of useful things that you can use to make your life that much better, it does, and it should be respected as such.<br /><br />Many negative reviews state that Ferriss contradicts himself, he doesn't, the routines are not meant to be used together, they're meant to be used seperately, and that's why he says, which 150 pages are you going to use to change your life.  I started with the weight loss, my focus is weight loss, my father, one month ago, started with muscle gain, he's already started showing signs of losing that beer gut, and getting back his arms that he had when he was young... also, the doctor told him to cut back on his cholesterol medication, the first time in thirty years.<br /><br />So, do you believe results or physical trainers who say it's impossible, do you believe those who have done it, or those who say it's ridiculous and shouldn't be done.  Scientist and doctors and physical trainers once said, man cannot run a four minute mile... many things in this book are likely to turn out to be the four minute mile for those naysayers.<br /><br />P.S.<br />High Intesity Interval Training is the tool of many runners, weight lifters, body builders, and athletes.  You get 10 times the work done, in a tenth of the time. The formula I am finding to work the best, just incredible, is two thirty minute work outs a week, along with five twelve minute work outs in three minute intervals a week--if you can't find 4 times in the day where you have three minutes to yourself, then you have bigger problems than weight.  Interval training is marked with increased speed--full running for a minute at a time if jogging is your thing, switching back and forth between jogging two minutes, running for one for thirty minutes.  Or air squats, wall push-ups, and chest pulls with little break in between.  I also do weights at high intervals--information on such can be found in Tom Venuto's book, and The New Rules of Lifting.<br /><br />I hope this was informative.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I wanted to make sure.  But, I am on set to have my best weight loss week, since I started this diet.  In my review of diets, materials, and conversations with trainers, weight lifters, and runners, not to mention my now continued success and experience.  Fruits--not fruit juice--fruits have no negative effect to weight loss, in fact, if you are not a nut eater, as I'm not--I tried them for this but wasn't satisfied--they are a great healthy substitute to put on calories.

0553108034|5.0|I love these books. If you love fantasy books, then A Song of Ice and Fire is the series you want.    These books do not have the usual \\"Black and white\\" characters, each character is their own, fun, dark, lovable, grey, and most of all: Killable.  George Martin does a wonderful job of leading you into liking a character, only to kill them off. This is such a change from other fantasy novels that I have read (15 years of reading and hundreds of Fantasy books) that I had to re-read the books several times, and my opinion of each character changed with each time.    Reading these books is like reading a person- several people, at once. You never know what is going to happen. For example, throw all the dangerous chemicals, known and unknown to you, into a tub, and these books are what come out.
B003ZK58WM|3.0|Loved Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  Despite metiocre reviews and the high kindle price I was hopeful.  I forced my way to the end only to be left disappointed.  I feel there was much more depth that could have been explored in the characters and less on the timeline of historical events.  Hardly got to know them.

B004WCTLNY|1.0|The movie starts with Matt Damon's character David Norris in the heat of elections which he loses,  then meets a girl in the men's bathroom and falls in love.<br /><br />Then the Hat People come into picture.  They seem to have special powers, but also seem to be utterly incompetent, and don't have problem changing their minds.  They kept talking about the Plan, preventing the ripples, and everybody neatly fitting into it, and getting punished if they don't go along with it.  Just think about it.  There were at least 9 Hat People assigned to Mr David Norris.  That being average would mean that 90% of the people should be wearing hats all day long.  In the last half of the movie, Matt Damon is running around wearing a hat, presumably giving him special powers.  How could wearing a hat give anybody any power?<br /><br />Throughout the movie rules are invoked as needed: you can turn the door knobs one way, unless you are wearing a hat, turn it the other way.  What if the door does not have a knob and it has a handle?  Maybe they did not think through that one?<br /><br />Another angle to this movie would be Fate versus Free Will.  It would be an interesting topic to cover, but not with the Hat People.<br /><br />This is not an action movie, there are no special effects in it.  It is not a sci-fi movie.  It could be considered a romance or a love story.  Since it is not funny, it is not a comedy either.  What it is is a time waster.  If you have infinite time, by all means watch it!<br /><br />It is filled with holes and inconsistencies.  I can understand the suspension of disbelief, however there should be some logic, rhyme or reason within itself.<br /><br />I guess nobody is immune to producing a trash like this, even the legendary Philip K. Dick or Matt Damon.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|This DVD of Eugene Onegin is so great that I have given it as presents.  The stars and Gergiev as conductor are the best there is.  The DVD is only second best to actually seeing the same production at The Met.
B001OCVC1E|1.0|First up, the movie, The Dark Knight is great. The item I'm reviewing is not.  1) The description is false. IT IS NOT THREE DISCS'. THERE IS NOT DIGIAL COPY.  2) The cover/Steal booklet feels cheap and very generic,  3) Way overprice for the lack of content and quality.  4) ...There is no content other then the movie, which amazed me since they state it's a special edition.  5) It is not universal region coded.    I personally have already contacted Amazon (which by the way has always been extremely cooperative regarding these sorts of matters) on the grounds of a refund. Nil concerns voiced.
0062112430|4.0|There are plenty of reviews for Delirium with plot summaries, so I'll jump right into what I thought about the book.<br />I liked it a lot quite a bit, almost in spite of myself. As others have said, the pacing is slow and there are similarities to Ally Condie's \\"Matched.\\" At first, I kept  comparing the two books as I read but when I started taking Delirium on its own terms I enjoyed it much more.<br /> There's no denying the action doesn't start until later in the book, and the whole thing is a little too long. BUT...I really didn't care. Oliver's writing is poetry, and anytime I found myself wishing the pace would pick up, I would suddenly be bowled over by an exquisite image or sentence and forgive the book any of its faults. I think we all have things we will overlook if other elements of a book are good enough, and for me a slow plot can be dealt with if the writing is striking. Huge chunks of the narration read  like blank verse poetry. If you find that sort of thing bothersome, this book probably isn't for you.  If, like me, you're a reader who will get teary-eyed over a beautiful turn of phrase, I think you'll love this book.<br />As far as the plot goes, t I didn't really buy it. I can never imagine any society looking at its own vices and evil, then deciding, \\"You know what? Love caused all this! Let's perform brain surgery on all our citizens so they can't love anyone.\\"<br />Dystopias work best when they take a present societal problem (like the proliferation of technology and lack of in-depth learning mentioned in \\"Matched\\") that you can actually imagine progressing and growing worse. I have no idea how any government would ever see fit to outlaw love, but as I said, I just read the book for the gorgeous prose and the romance. However, it's not just romantic love that Lauren Oliver contemplates, although that is certainly the main focus of the novel. The book is sort of a hymn to all types of love: romance, the love of dear friends, and familial love.<br />I ended the book and immediately starting searching online to see if there is a sequel. If there wasn't, I couldn't have lived with the ending. I was happy to see this is the first of a trilogy, and book two (Pandemonium) will be out in the spring of 2012.ook and immediately starting searching online to see if there is a sequel.

B003N5VOUO|5.0|Alright, so I know that the movie was a *little* goofy but the story was awesome and the thoughts behind it were spectacular. If you are into love stories, this love story is beautifully done. The actors (actresses) are beautiful people who do a great job portraying their characters. This is definitely in my top 10 favorite movies.     Originally rented the movie from a red-box and then hunted one down to buy on here. I would recommend this movie to anyone. :)

B004EYT932|1.0|I'd really like to read this book. And I'd like to read it on my Kindle. But Amazon and publishers will not take time to make tables and charts legible. It's easier to just quickly port text to Kindle format and let the buyer beware.<br /><br />I downloaded the Kindle sample, and, as expected, it avoids showing any tables or figures. I assume this is because they're lousy on a Kindle. And the sample is 90% table of contents and lists of tables (none of which can be seen).<br /><br />When is Amazon going to give their Kindle users well formatted books?? It's well past time Amazon did this.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I'll not buy these from Amazon. One small vote.<br /><br />I found it at my library instead, with an online search, hold and SMS text notice to me when it's in my local branch. Takes a few days max.
B003KUSUG8|3.0|I've been listening to Eminem's Music since the early 2000s which was IMO when he was most successful. As an *Old* fan I have to agree with the reviews that claims this isn't Em's best work. It's not his worse I'll give him that and it's great to know he's finally off drugs and is improving his life but compared to his earlier albums the MMLP, SSLP and even Infinite Recovery is *different*. The Passion in his voice is still there, but it no longer posses this witty, dark, twisted Humor that was his trademark in the first couple of albums. Another thing that makes Recovery different is that it is *somehow* SOFT. Remember when Eminem used to be Slim Shady ? and he was talking about killing his wife and mother ?<br /><br />Disappointed ? Yeah, I guess I am in a Way. I understand that artists need the urge to develop, change and improve their styles a bit in order to keep up with current issues. People change too, You're not the same person you were 5 to 10 years ago. You gotta change somehow. And I think I can't really blame Eminem on wanting to change or try something different. Obviously he has matured. He's nearly 40, it isn't appropriate for him to rap about the same things he used to rap about 10 years ago. I don't have any problem with that just to keep variety in his work. However, was it really necessary for him to collaborate with *Pop* acts ? All the guest stars in this album is Legit Pop. You got Rihanna, P!nk and Lil Wayne (some people may consider him Rap but I consider him Pop or R&B at best).<br /><br />Eminem used to make fun of *Pop* music. He used to bash on Britney Spears, *NSYNC and all that good stuff that were popular in the early 2000s. And Now for him to make songs with people who represent Pop Music is just...sad. He even made a song with Bruno Mars lately. Now, Don't get me wrong I like Bruno Mars, I like P!nk and Rihanna is just O.K. But they have totally different styles. I can't imagine someone like Eminem who used to rap about drugs and killing people making a music with someone like Bruno Mars who sings about Love ? It just doesn't fit. For example, You don't see a Rap singer in a Country song now do you ?<br /><br />Now, I know Recovery was a HIT. It was probably the number one most selling album in 2010. I'm not saying that the entire album was terrible. There are songs that were great but this is NOT Eminem's best work it's far from it. I also understand that the singles that were on this album that made it to radio play has gained Eminem a renewed popularity among the new generation. They also gained him new fans, who like his new stuff but have absolutely no clue as to what his older stuff used to be.<br /><br />I'm not trying to hate on Eminem or to hate on this album for that matter, but if you believe that this is the best album he has ever produced then you've obviously never listened to any of his albums prior to Encore. If you liked Recovery then I urge you to give his LPs especially the MMLP a listen, give it a try. You'll see a Huge difference between His style back then and his style now.<br /><br />On the contrary, You gotta give him some credit for trying. I would still probably buy his upcoming albums and hopefully they'll live up to his older stuff. I still have to admit that Eminem is still the best Mainstream Rapper today IMHO. Even at his worse Eminem is way better than Lil Wayne, Drake, Young Money (or any of those mainstream pop acts who want to be rappers) can ever be. Also, I gotta give him another credit for *not* singing about b*tches and how much rich he is.aking a music with someone like Bruno Mars who sings about Love ? It just doesn't fit.

B000V6U80A|5.0|A beautiful blend of Celtic and Scandinavian music, perfectly composed to relax your body, mind, and spirit. Entire Album can be listed to in about 40 minutes. It's a perfect escape to another place in time, a place to let your imagination free and unlock your pent up stress. Try listening to it to fall asleep and you won't be disappointed. A college friend from Albania first let me borrow this in 1997 and I'm so glad I rediscovered it on Amazon for so cheap. I remember how much I enjoyed the beauty and magic of this CD back then and time has done nothing to diminish it...Please download and enjoy this music!

B002SF9YNO|5.0|This was a great movie and enjoyed it very much when I received it from Netflix.  I was under the impression that I had ordered the CD music score from the film not the movie from Amazon,since my initial was looking at the music site within the menu .  I was unaware that I had made an error until the DVD for Departures arrive.  Not sure how or where the change happened from music to film.  I felt that somehow within your system or ordering my original intent was switched.      VERY UNHAPPY THAT I DID NOT RECEIVE HE MUSIC FROM DEPTARTURES.    Bill Thomas
B0059R5Q08|5.0|I have been waiting somewhat impatiently for this adaptation of Jane Eyre to hit Amazon.  Being in a small town I was not able to see the movie in theaters because of its limited release.  I absolutely adored this movie!!  While not everything ran in line with the book, particularly a lack of emphasis on certain characters, it was beautifully conceived.  I loved how exacting the details were to the time period, especially in regards to how gothic everything was.  The casting was perfect!!  Fassbender is by far my favorite Rochester...the most likeable in comparison to other actors--most attractive too ;).  In some of the other versions I could not conceive of why Rochester was attractive to Jane.  I could really feel Jane's angst in this one...could feel her torment as she ran away.  Another reviewer mentioned that they felt Jane came across as weak...I definitely don't agree.  Her morals were her strength...they allowed her to do some very difficult things, especially given her age.  I just finished watching it and am ready for another round.  Focus Features did another great one!

0671775308|4.0|The authors have some very good points. They do a good job of drawing the distinction between those with wealth and those that live as though they have wealth. Further, the book goes into the decision making process to think as an accumulator of wealth.<br /><br />This is not a get rich book, this is a book to shape the reader's thinking to be more like the rich. The section on Economic Outpatient Care and advice on how to deal with children and assets after death was especially insightful.<br /><br />Once you get the basics, it can be slightly repetitive, as many academic texts are.
B0055CJ8T2|5.0|I must admit, I was skeptical to get this CD.  Although I love \\"Motivation\\", Kelly usually only has about 2 - 3 songs I like.  But I like this CD, a great deal, it's a perfect mix of rnb and pop and she carries them both extremely well.  She draws you in with \\"I'm Dat Chick\\" which is a great rnb song and a good look for her.  If you are not a big pop fan it really doesnt matter because by the time you get to the pop songs (in my opinion)  you are so into the CD you just go with it.  I have the deluxe CD so those songs will be excluded from my ratings below.  But I will tell you this her remix of \\"Commander\\" w/ Nelly is awesome, a nice rnb groove!!      1. I'm Dat Chick(5)- Great song from the very first word and beat.  2. Work It Man(3.5) - Had to grow on me, but its a nice song.  3. Motivation(5) - We all know this one.  4. Lay It On Me(5) - A song that will get you in that party mood and ready for the night.  5. Feeling Me Right Now(5) - Should be next single.  Listen to the words and you know...  6. Turn It Up(5) - I got so into this song almost got a speeding ticket (kinda lost myself with the beat and her voice)  7. All of The Night(4) - Not that memorable but it fits the groove its placed in.  8. Keep It Between Us(3) - Not a big fan of.  9. Commander(4) - Nice club song but the remix (on the deluxe CD) is better.  10. Down For Whatever(5) - A nice way to close the CD...still partying.    All I can say is Bey better \\"back back back it up cause Kelly the one I got my on\\"
0553801473|5.0|I'm surprised by the 3-star reviews.  This book has been a long time coming and it does not disappoint. We get all the things we love in this series: complex characters, plot twists, violence, sex, more violence and more sex and more plot twists. I'm 90% through the book, it's entertaining as hell, and even though it weights about 20 lbs, I can't put it down. Which makes me wonder what so many people are complaining about. Are you just bitter that you had to wait so long? Get over it! This is a great fantasy series, one of the very best, and when I'm finished devouring the last 10% of \\"A Dance with Dragons,\\" I'll go back to re-reading the other books until the next one comes out.
0545259088|4.0|Grace and Sam are two young lovers who only want to be together. There's just a few things standing in their way. One, Grace's parents don't approve of their relationship (even though they were pretty much non-parents before Sam came into her life). Two, Grace just so happened to turn into a wolf at the end of the last book. Sam, of course, was cured, so that pretty much puts a damper on the spending any time together thing. Three, just about everyone in Mercy Falls thinks that Sam has killed Grace. Four, Isabel Culpepper's father wants every wolf in Mercy Falls dead. He's still pretty bitter with the death of his only son. Understandable? Yes. Absolutely necessary? No. To top everything off, a certain female has turned up dead, mutilated by a very nasty werewolf that was never really in her right mind to begin with. There's plenty of suspense and intensity here, but there were plenty of horriblt drawn out chapters that kept me from getting completely drawn into the story, as well. Grace and Sam are two very endearing characters, however, so I could never give their story any less than four stars.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I have only completed 4 days so far but I must say this video is awesome! I thought I was in fairly decent shape...boy was I wrong. After 4 days I feel stronger already, can't wait to see and feel the results after 30! I have thought about doing it a second time in the afternoons but have decided not, too fearful of noodle legs. I really appreciate the fact that Jillian is honest and encouraging right when you want to stop and fall to the floor.  I can't stress how great it feels to be worn slap out when its over! In my opinion a work out like this is the best for busy Mom's with only a few minutes to spare.

0439023513|3.0|After constantly trying to escape the grips of the Capitol, Katniss finds herself slowly falling apart. With everything around her spinning out of control- she knows the only thing she can do is rebel. Katniss is the Mockingjay.<br /><br />This book had a few things that were hard to grasp. In the previous books, Suzanne Collins did a terrific job pacing everything- when in this book I found some parts extremely slow and then some I had a hard time understanding what was going on. This book seemed to be the most emotional, only because of how some things ended. It was an interesting read, but all I got out of it was dread.
0553801473|3.0|This book is good fun to read but it and a feast for crows are nothing compared to the first 3 books.<br />Its as if Martin had a solid outline for the fist 3 books and then the outline finished with the third book.<br />It really seems like he is just making up stuff off the top of his head to fill pages.<br />Sometimes in this book a character will seemingly die but then somehow miraculously get out of it and your left wishing that he actually did die so that there could finally be some plot progression<br /><br />There are so many opportunities for awesomeness that slide by.  I finish reading a chapter and say to myself this book is... and the first word that comes to mind is boring.<br />there are so many let chapters that are unnecessary that half the pages i find myself skimming over the words.<br /><br />Hopefully the next book will pack more of a punch, because i am upset by the nonchalance of this one.
0439023491|4.0|After forcing the Capitol to let both Peeta and Katniss win the Hunger Games, their life becomes even more complicated. With the Capitol watching their every move, Peeta and Katniss go on the tour of every district- trying to persuade everyone they are in love. Even if they do accomplish to persuade the citizens of Panem, will their acts be enough for themselves?<br /><br />Another book I had to geet used to. Though there is not the thrill of being in an arena where you are forced to kill those around you, it is more upsetting than the first book. The arena was just a game, but now- Peeta and Katniss have to endure the capitol. Another good book in the sense of joining another world, but this is a different type of game.
B001AQR3IU|4.0|This was one flew well under the radar in a lot of the country, but what a magical, wonderful, whimsical movie. A love story with a grand adventure, a quest (or two) and some wild side stories all rolled into one. Best of all, suprise moments with Robert DeNiro, Ricky Gervais and others suddenly appearing on the screen in characters that you would never expect, but will thoroughly enjoy.<br />Found it by accident, bought it on purpose and it's a great addition to any collection!
0439023521|4.0|In a not-too-distant future, the United States of America has collapsed, weakened by drought, fire, famine, and war, to be replaced by Panem, a country divided into the Capitol and 12 districts. Each year, two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal intimidation of the subjugated districts, the televised games are broadcasted throughout Panem as the 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors, literally, with all citizens required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as the mining district's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. In this both tragic and thrilling book- you will find yourself wondering what will happen next.<br /><br />I found this book quite disturbing. When I would take a break from reading it, I would find myself feeling terrible about what was happening. The author does an amazing job bringing you into the story and the world of The Hunger Games- and I think that is why I got so upset about what was happening. It is both gruesome and horrific- and leaves you wondering what terrible thing will happen next.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|From the amazing acting of the vilianess Cate Blanchett to the 'Wristcutter's reminiscent whistling tune of Tom Hollander to the wonderful direction of Joe Wright- this film is a masterpiece. Then final moments- how the movie is brought full circle will leave you astounded, inspired, and feeling as if there is so much this world has to offer. This is the best movie I've seen all year. I would recommend it to anyone who would consider them self a stylistic, well rounded person. If you tend to like stylish indie flicks such as 'The Life Aquatic', 'Wristcutters', and 'Scott Pilgrim', you'll greatly enjoy and appreciate this film. If you're hesitant to buy this film because, like me, you aren't a fan of younger characters, buy it anyways. Saoirse Ronan has earned an Academy Award, as well as a Golden Globe to prove that she has what it takes to hold her own against the amazing talents of actors Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett. The latter should have won some sort of award for this. She's an excellent villain.

0553801473|1.0|...and a story with this much potential and this many unresolved plot-lines should be anything but boring.<br /><br />NOTHING HAPPENS!  I think the characters must have gotten frustrated with their creator, as he had them going around in circles much of the time.  I had to force myself to finish it...unlike the page-turning excitement of the other four books.<br /><br />I mean, what WAS this?  Characters are all over the map, the story jumps around like a spastic insect, there are pages and pages of descriptions of the food and the clothes...and very little substance.<br /><br />Cersei's one chapter was good and the description of Dany finally riding the dragon was excellent - but not much more.  Really.<br /><br />I'll read the next two books because I want to find out what happens...but I hope they are better written than this ponderous tome.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|My daughter got this as a gift for her first birthday. It is by far her favorite gift, along with her doll stroller. She carries her \\"baby\\" with her everywhere. She has had numerous dolls before this and she did not pay attention to them at all. From the time we got this doll out of the package she has been in love! This is the sweetest little doll that is the perfect size for her to carry around. I am definitely going to buy one for my niece for her 2nd birthday!
B001HMSFFC|1.0|I was sadly disappointed in this movie.  I would think it would show the continuing lives of the characters as they got older in a positive way.  Instead it was a doom and gloom movie.  Everything seeemed to go wrong.  This was supprising after the end of the series that showed things going so well and open hearts.  They seemed to lack compassion.  I was sorry that I went to the movie theatre and actually paid to see this movie.  Everyone is different but I cannot for the life of me see why more positive things were not in the movie and the growing lives of the characters.  Instead they seemed to move backwards in their growth.  The series, \\"Sex and the City\\" is by far much better.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|This app installed just fine on my phone but I really didn't like it. It claims to make texting, emailing much easier, but I found it to be super annoying
B004RLPTT0|4.0|The songs can stand alone, but make much more sense in the context of the movie.  For instance, several review mention the Queen/Armegeddon mash-up as being out of place in this soundtrack.  I agree.  The rap-rock-metal song sounds odd next to Emily Browning's covers and Bjork, but that is only due to the fact that it was to represent a particular person in the movie.  I don't think it should have been included in the soundtrack.  I'm kind of upset that the Lords of Acid instrumental didn't make it in.  Overall, worth buying, but watch the movie so it makes more sense.
0316044695|5.0|Read this book to understand what it takes to be a Seal and their importance in defeating our enemies.  They remind us of David's mighty warriors and their amazing feats.

B0030IIYWA|5.0|Toy Story is a wonderful story about toys that come to \\"life\\" when kids aren't around.  It is a fantastic movie about Woody (the cowboy)and Buzz Lightyear (the space ranger) and how they go on the adventure of all time - getting lost and then trying to get back to Andy's house after being stuck in the \\"mean\\" kid next doors room (mean because he tortures toys!)    This is one that you can watch with your kids and it isn't torture!  We have watched it as a family many times and I still find myself laughing at some of the jokes!
006112429X|4.0|When I picked up Lionel Shriver's We Need To Talk About Kevin, I knew I was in for an emotionally challenging read.  The book is a mother's reflections on raising a son who became the perpetrator of a school shooing in the late 90s (he is annoyed by the fact that the Columbine kids got more media).  It is presented as a series of letters to her husband who never quite saw why she was concerned that Kevin was never quite normal from infancy.  She readily admits that she was not the best mother and she, and the reader, is left wondering about the nature/nurture divide.      As I said, I knew it would be a challenging topic.  I was unprepared for the challenging prose.  I can see how it fits the narrator, it is a bit pretentious and wordy and the mother is definitely the type who would write in such a manner.  It made it a real struggle to read the book at first and it took about 100 pages for me to adjust, a period during which I was wondering if I'd gotten into a book I would regret starting.        In the end, however, I am glad I stuck it out.  Even noting the initial struggle, the book easily gets four stars (of five) from me.  I like that the narrator doesn't ask for forgiveness or ignore her own faults.  She also openly addresses whether she is giving herself too much \\"credit\\" for the creation of Kevin.  The author never really falls on either the nature or nurture side, which I appreciate since I'm pretty sure the \\"answer\\" lies someplace in the middle.  If you've read more or my rambly reviews, you know I'm a reader who focuses on characters over plot and Kevin and his mother are very well-drawn and nuanced.  The father feels less so, but that may be appropriate since he is portrayed as caught up in an image of fatherhood that ignores the reality that is his son.        The book is certainly dark, but I also didn't find it as bad as it might have been.  There's certainly an aura of evil, but (for those concerned) it didn't feel like the stuff that would cause sleepless nights.  It is a study in character and darkness providing lots of fodder for thought.  It isn't an easy read, either in style or substance, but I found it worth the work.

B004LL1HM4|3.0|From the first few seconds of Mykonos I have immediately loved everything Fleet Foxes have done. This album was different for me. At first I hated it but I persevered. After 5 listens I still didn't like it. It just didn't have the glorious hooks of the earlier stuff. I normally wouldn't bother with an album after that but I sensed something I might like in this and I gave it more time. After something like 10 listens I now like it. But not nearly as much as the earlier work. For me, it's all quite forgettable but it's still quite nice background music.
1932100660|5.0|This book has changed our lives. The education has helped us understanding the benefits of eating plant based foods. We tested ourselves and eliminated all animal based food. Our overweight tummies have disappeared, our bad cholesterol numbers are lower our good cholesterol numbers are higher and we are now able to exercise comfortably which has created muscle definition and increased core strength in our bodies.  We borrowed the book from the library initially, we are now investing in the book for ourselves and for our friends.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Great read! I very much enjoyed this book. Hard to put down so I read into all hours of the night. You really feel for the character of Chrissy and get drawn into the trauma of not having any memories yet you know something is off. A thriller!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have only seen the Firth/BBC version once and couldn't get past the hairstyles... however, I am in love with this Keira Knightley/Matthew MacFayden version from 2005. When I say \\"in love\\", I really mean it. I can always watch that movie and never be bored. The score is also amazing. While it does have some creative interpretations on happenings in the book as well as some creative cuts, I think that what they do include in the movie is very well done. There is a lot of chemistry between the actors, which I think is especially well played out in the gazebo scene in the rain. This movie is definitely worth multiple viewings, even if you just pop it in to listen to the beautiful score.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|I can't comment on how accurate this movie is historically, but I can say that it presents a very \\"real\\" love story, and the depiction of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's friendship, courtship, and marriage is quite beautiful.  First, we see the pair build a friendship that is built on trust and common ground. This blossoms into feelings for one another, but this is put on hold as Victoria deals with the new changes in her life. Albert demonstrates steadfastness and patience while he waits until Victoria is ready. While their marriage is full of love and respect, we also see a glimpse of their passionate power struggle with each other. All in all, it presents a very inspiring view of marriage and love as learn to selflessly want the best for each other. A very well done movie, and Emily Blunt is especially fantastic.
B005BW15XS|4.0|This album is HOT! - from I'm Dat Chick to Commander [Urban Mix] in the Deluxe Edition. This is truly a great album - a definite must have! My most favorite song on the album is Commander. I kind of wish that Heaven & Earth had an R&B beat instead of a pop beat but the album is still good from beginning to end!;)
B000WZAE1I|5.0|To be honest, I'm not sure if I can explain why I love this movie. I just do. I seriously notice something new every time I watch it. I like to think of it as a less cheesy (but still plenty of cheese!) version of The Princess Bride. The acting is quite superb, with a collection of great actors including Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Robert DeNiro as well as newcomer Charlie Cox. Ian McKellen also adds great character as the narrator. The script is also well written, and I actually think it's a better story than the original book by Neil Gaiman, on which the movie is based. I also really enjoy great movie scores, and the score by Ilan Eshkeri is one of my favorite movie scores.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I solved the whole thing in an afternoon. I was hoping for something that might challenge me a little more.
1932100660|5.0|I read this book shortly after it was released and have given a copy to our children and to others whom would benefit. My husband was diagnosed with high cholesterol years ago and then had bypass surgery 11 years ago.  My goal is to improve his and my eating habits.  The results have been wonderful and our youngest son and his wife have also embraced a mostly plant based diet.  My husband is 72 and in excellent health thanks to our diet.  Dr. Campbell has written an excellent book that is full of important health research that is easy to comprehend.
B004UXUXGE|5.0|Whether you are the type who reluctantly goes to a museum and looks at a painting for three seconds, or whether you are the one who holds up the tour group might be the best indication of whether you might like this film. This movie is not for the first group. It's not aimed specifically at the second group either, but may seem that way to people in the first one.<br /><br />The narration is sometimes interesting, but is like getting a tour guide who has half the crowd listening while some others wonder off to look around; at times you will appreciate what the narration is saying and at other times the caves will speak for themselves. I'm not sure if it's a five star movie or narration but it's a five star tour.<br /><br />Traveling through a cave with shifting lighting from a torch and seeing the curving walls around you is how the art was conceived. 3D is essential here. I printed out pictures of the cave walls to show others, and found that if I curved them and held them at a certain angle they had a feel that fell apart when they were held flat. In a sense, the paintings were sculpture-like, and shading, viewing angle, and lighting all mattered.<br /><br />Near the beginning, I wondered how things could hold up for the length of a movie. Spending more time on some of the paintings is the only way to get a sense of what they convey. Not being able to control how long is the down side. Overall, the length of the movie and the amount of time spent in each area is perhaps the best compromise.<br /><br />It's not merely the age of the paintings, or what they show. It goes beyond showing how wildlife factored into in everyday life. In some cases, it was the first indication of what certain extinct species looked like alive or how they lived and congregated.  Other artifacts in the caves gave information about tools or music of the era(s), such as flutes with tuned chromatic scales. Apparently, many modern things were invented in ancient times. This film provided breathtaking footage of caves that are off limits to almost everybody, and at times a tad too much speculation. What was prehistoric is now history.<br /><br />The film worked well on a big screen in 3D. It will lose a lot in 2D and on a smaller screen, but a 3D disc might turn out to be the best way to revisit certain features, view them at your own pace, and not let the narration sidetrack you.e off limits to almost everybody, and at times a tad too much speculation.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|This is my favorite of the Twilight Series! Everything just adds up and falls into place! If you're trying to take this book literally and get some kind of life lesson from it, DON'T! IT'S FICTION, so read it with that in mind. Stephenie's work is easy to read and spellbinding. More than once, I caught myself exclaiming aloud over the twists that she came up with! I was very sad to come to the end of this book, but it was okay, cause i just read it over again!
0553801473|1.0|Just finished the book and am completely PO'd. After the letdown of AFFC I thought there would be nowhere to go but up. What a disappointment. The plot lumbered along at a snails pace for almost 900 pages until my interest perked. And after the last Jon chapter I'm supposed to wait another six years to find out what happens? And why the heck did he even have the Prince of Dorne? What a waste. This ADD style of writing goes every which way but forward. I can't believe I waited this long for such a crappy book!
031261246X|5.0|This book was something that I needed to take a break from only the technical stuff that I was reading lately. However, I'm not saying that this book is not technical; it's kind of technical, educational, exciting, breathtaking, and fun at the same time. I couldn't stop reading it until I finished (it was a right thing to do on a rainy weekend). I absolutely loved it. Glad I've pre-ordered it...    I would recommend this book to all the people that love thrillers and technology, especially combined (as in this book).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app does provide fun entertainment despite all the negative reviews. Some of the games are easy, but many are a bit challenging. That makes it quite nice... try a little harder on some and not have to get annihilated on others. The point system is no big deal...not unachievable. It&apos;s easy to rack up thousands of points which is more than enough to unlock other mini games. I&apos;m happy with my (free) download. Try it out for yourself... don&apos;t let the bad reviews make up your mind on this one.
0545259088|4.0|I have loved this series from the beginning. Shiver, book one in The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy was one of the first YA (Young Adult) books I ever picked up and read. I had no use for Twilight Saga at the time (but after Maggie I did try more YA novels, including Twilight) and I really had no interest in books aimed at teenage girls. I had been there, done that already, and I wasn't a fan of those kinds of books. I soon came to realize that books aimed at teens nowadays are a lot different than the books that were aimed at teens when I was a teenager...which was about two decades ago now. Man I'm old...<br /><br />As much as people say don't judge a book by it's cover, I have to admit I was drawn to Shiver by it's cover.<br /><br />You see, I adore wolves. Actually adore might be too light a term, slightly obsessed might be more accurate. That lonely little silhouetted wolf on the cover, in blue tones, with the title Shiver...well that's what I did...I shivered. I tuned the book over and the blurb immediately captured my attention.<br /><br />I have great memories of a time spent at a friend's house who had wolves wander their property. I often imagined what it would be like just to sit there and watch them. I knew after reading that blurb I just had to read the rest of the book. The final prize was opening to the first page and seeing the beautiful blue font the book was printed in. The whole book was just a complete piece of artwork. I was sold.<br /><br />Linger, the second book, pulled me deeper into the woods. With it's green cover and green print it was another piece of artwork beautifully done. I have a review of Linger on my blog if you are interested in reading my thoughts on it.<br /><br />And that brings us to Forever. What a great title for the end of such a wonderful series.<br /><br />I actually had to take some time after finishing the book to reflect on my feelings of the book, and the series overall. At first I wasn't entirely sure if I was happy with everything, but in the end I admitted I mostly like how the author tied things up. There could have been more, but it could have been much worse as well (knowing how Maggie likes to torment and torture her readers - as she has admitted personally). It was a bit too open to interpretation, but at least it wasn't a horrid cliffhanger.<br /><br />As is always typical in Maggie's books, the language and writing style is stunningly beautiful, like lyrics, like poetry, just flowing on the pages. Her wolf imagery is so realistic, and after hearing her speak and reading some of her recommended wolf titles I see she put in many hours of research on the topic. As I have mentioned before I am quite obsessed with wolves and love when authors can pull them off well. I hate when they fail miserably. Maggie Stiefvater and Kelley Armstrong are the two writers who I feel write wolves very well (realistic).<br /><br />The realistic nature of the wolves, and the people who fear them, becomes even more frightfully alive near the end of the book. I literally held my breath through the last 20 pages or so. When it was all over and I had closed the book I noticed I wasn't breathing, my chest hurt, and my heart was racing. Yes, it was that emotional for me.<br /><br />I was very happy to see more depth added to Isabella and Cole's characters, and their connection to each other. I felt they were sidelined way too much in the previous novel. It was also interesting to see Sam and Grace's relationship flipped around as Sam was sat waiting around and worrying in his human form as Grace frolicked in the wintry woods.stly like how the author tied things up.

B004JQN4WM|5.0|I got this bad boy just two days ago, and after reading up on the Ankylosaur's anatomy and the current fossils we have of this species, there are a couple of anatomical inaccuracies. Firstly, the Ankylosaur had flat scutes on it's back, not spikes, like some similar armored dinos.<br /><br />But who really cares about that, anyway? Just look at this little guy! Posed dynamically, as if to defend itself against the mighty T-Rex (also sold by Papo, I recommend it!), this little guy has some serious presence.<br /><br />That's good...as he will need it, at a mere 6 inches long. I know Papos are not known for their scale, but this guy is very small. Just as the Triceratops is too large compared to the Styracosaurus...and the T-Rex is too small compared to the Trike.<br /><br />All minor quibbles when you take into account the lovely sculpting done here, as well as the great paint detailing.<br /><br />My major grief is the small size of this otherwise magnificent specimen. Please see the attached photos for scale purposes vis-a-vis it's fellow Papo dinosaur brethren. Compared to the other Anklyosaur figures, I must give this 5 stars. Are the other companies even trying?<br /><br />Do I recommend this Papo also? certainly. When it comes to detail, the extreme care obviously shown in the sculpts (when you look at a Papo, you can tell someone put their heart into it. It wasn't sculpted in an hour...), Papo is the only game in town. I just wish it were larger, and more anatomically accurate (based upon the fossils we currently have).<br /><br />If you like dinosaur figures...Papo is the way to go.

0312370849|1.0|I kept hearing about this book and the related movie, and it sounded like a really interesting story.  Unfortunately, the book was a total waste of time.    The writing was not good at all, and the switching back and forth in time didn't help.  It only irritated me, because it felt like I was switching between an ok work of historical fiction and a totally horrible piece of chick lit.  I didn't care anything about the present-day characters, and the glimpses into the past, which were more interesting, petered out and disappeared entirely later in the book.    This could have been so much better!  I ended up skimming the rest and just gave up in the end.  Don't bother.
B0028RXXFC|4.0|First of all this DVD set is for adults, not young kids or impressionable teenage boys.  Of course that is my oppion.  Adult male \\"friends\\" call it a porn movie.  But it isn't. THis is just what was done back in those days.  So full male and female frontal nudity is present in nearly every disc.  This does not bother me.  Perhaps it could have been left out of the production, and still have a very good history of Rome presented.  There is violence thru out. Political manipulations, too.  It is good to view the other comments and such to get further understanding of the era.   THe product is in a book like case, with a disc secured safely in each slot.
0385342055|2.0|This book had so much promise, but it fails to be anything but a cringeworthy, vapid read because Kinsella refused to flesh out her characters and allow them to develop throughout the book. I gave this book two stars because I do plan to leaf through the next book in the series to see if it has any potential and if the characters changed; I still have hope! :) However, I will be checking it out of the library.    I think that the author meant for Becky's \\"promise\\" to Luke not to buy anything for herself until October to be an indication of character reformation, but it was hard to appreciate given the fact that Becky continues to fabricate stories to her family, teach her daughter her poor habits, and indulge in her addictive shopaholic tendencies with purchases for Minnie and Luke.    To be honest, the subplot of Tom and Jess's marriage and their relations with Janice and Martin intrigued me more than Becky's story. And I really would have liked to see more of Elinor's story.    A quick rundown (spoilers):   - Becky is a pathological liar. Her silliness and passion for extravagance reminds me a lot of Mrs. Bennet in Pride & Prejudice.   - Luke continues to be a secretive, reclusive workaholic, barely spending any time with his family.   - Becky will never learn from her mistakes- Elinor helped her fund the party, her clients stood up for her when she was suspended for the illicit private secret shopper scheme, the nanny didn't provide any parenting tips, etc. She also will never break her shopping addiction because her husband can afford to bail her out if she goes bankrupt.  - etc, etc.
0345529057|1.0|We have here the American Tolkien, they tell me. The only parallel I see are the R. R. initials for the middle names...  Martin's 5 books so far would have benefited from a firm editorial hand. Book 1: Manhattan telephone directory with direwolves. 2. Slightly better--some of the telephone subscribers are killed off! 3. GOOD (not great): some slight character development in a manageable situation. 4. WHAT! 1/2 of the manageable world is carried to ballooning proportions for no reason, while the other 1/2 is left for... whenever... And there are MORE CHARACTERS! WHY??? Our author might decide to write again, but why do this to self and othera? 4. How predictable can this get??? Sure, use this dead-to-alive trick, but EVERY time? Cheap.  I'll read all the rest, whenever it might emerge, mainly to be able to tell people why I do so dislike this unprincipled, unconvincing world building. There are glimpses of a great author who could go far, but the restraint isn't there. JRRT--no threat to you!

B000005J56|5.0|One of the best CDs I've ever purchased. In the heat of Mexico, frogs croaking in the trees, toads in cool bosque mud, the eternal rhythms of these exquisitely talented musicians will make your heart sing and your body sway. We enjoy El Carretero #8, and Candela #9, but the whole work is amazing. \\"Chan Chan,\\" track 1, is a favorite, composed by an 89 year old man; talk about the gifts of age. The song regards a couple from Cuban folklore, who first appeared over a hundred years ago in Cuban songs. Here are the lyrics translated from Spanish in the informative booklet accompanying the superb CD:<br /><br />Chan Chan, by Francisco Repilado a.k.a. Compay Segundo<br /><br />I'm going from Alto Cedro to Marcan&eacute;<br />Then from Cueto, I'm going to Mayar&iacute;.<br /><br />The love I have for you<br />I cannot deny<br />My mouth is watering<br />I just can't help myself.<br /><br />When Juanika and Chan Chan<br />Sifted sand together on the beach<br />How her bottom shook and<br />Chan Chan was aroused!<br /><br />Clean the dry sugar cane leaves<br />from the path<br />So I can get to that trunk<br />I want to sit down.<br /><br />I'm going from Alto Cedro to Marcan&eacute;<br />Then from Cueto, I'm going to Mayar&iacute;.<br /><br />And now I'm returning to stir my enormous iron pot of beans & meat simmering with cumin & other spices. I also highly recommend [[ASIN:B000002KLX Borderline]] for playing in your pickup truck while driving across enormous Rocky Mountain western sea spaces. \\"The Girls from Texas\\" is a cautionary tale well worth repeated listening.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|The most addictive game on Android OS. Burned many hours on it and so will you. Highly recommended! Works great on EVO 3d.
0061537969|5.0|Please don't be put off by my frivolous title, nor by the fact that the story is mainly told by a dog. This book is full of deep insights into human nature, character, emotion, and motivation. And there are two huge bonuses: if you are a dog lover, the story has special appeal, and if you have any interest in auto racing, the road racing narratives in the story are among the best you'll find anywhere. Highly recommended -- a speedy, enjoyable read, worth your time -- you won't be disappointed.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|always.
B004SKLFJS|5.0|This is Lord of the Dance as it was intended, in my opinion. The editing and sound are superb and the cast and costuming were excellent! The only thing (minor) that I didn't care for is that the beautiful singing pieces and my favorite routine, Siamsa, were cut from the running production but are included as bonus clips. The documentary included was also done well and was very insightful! Highly recommended!!
B0018QXL1K|5.0|When I was a kid, EVERYONE had a copy of this cd.  But everyone had a copy of Limp Bizkit's 3 Dollar Bill Y'all and Spice World, too.  Hindsight is 20/20.  This is a rare shining example of pop music that is actually GOOD.      The reason this cd did so well was because it really captured the essence of the time period.  If you start with just the songs that were released as singles, its easy to see why the cd had the success it did.  I believe \\"Creep\\" came out first, followed by \\"Red Light Special\\" and the mega-hit \\"Waterfalls,\\" and then \\"Diggin On You.\\"  I don't remember a song from the 90s rivaling the airplay, video play, and overall success of \\"Waterfalls,\\" which warned of the dangers of sexual promiscuity and violence.  \\"Red Light Special,\\" and \\"Creep\\" brought the normal female seductress ballad to a new level of sexual intensity and introspection, which parallels what was going on in the culture at large, as women began using their sexuality as an asset, instead of a hindrance to cover up or be modest about.      TLC brought that infectious new jack/r&b style to an audience who embraced the fresh mix of harmony and Left Eye's frank rap interludes.  \\"Lets Do It Again,\\" \\"If I was your Girlfriend\\" (a prince cover), and \\"Take our Time\\" are similar to \\"Red Light Special\\" and \\"Diggin On You.\\"  \\"Case of the Fake People,\\" samples \\"Backstabbers\\" by the O'Jays.  \\"Switch\\" is more hip hop than r&b, and its a really fun song.  My personal favorite is the end track, \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" which features Dre from Outkast before they were big.  Left Eye is featured heavily on this song, and with Dre, she creates the darkest moments of the cd, but perhaps the most beautiful also.  If \\"Waterfalls\\" had a complete opposite or doppleganger, it would be \\"Somethin Wicked.\\"    I recommend this to EVERYONE.  If you were around in the 90s, it'll be a great trip down memory lane, and if you weren't, its a great place to start to get the feel of the 90s.  This cd OWNED the charts, the award shows, the airwaves, and the people's hearts in the mid 90s.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I downloaded Jaycee Dugard's book onto my Kindle, and then sat up half the night reading until I was done. I literally could not put it down.  The writing seems to be largely unedited; for me, this intensified the feelings I had as I read. The voice is Jaycee's. It's not a page turner in the sense that you don't know what's going to happen; the massive news coverage of Jaycee's freedom from her captors is well known. But what will (or should, IMO) grab you and hold you is Jaycee's indomitable spirit through years of unimaginable horrors.  It shows in what she has written now. It shows in what she wrote back then - a journal dedicated to watching her kitten grow, the journals she kept as she grew older and knew something was desperately wrong with her life.  I have to believe that even if she didn't know it, she was praying for her own release, and that prayer was answered in the form of two wonderful Berkeley campus police women.  It is also the best window into the mind of a captive that I have ever looked through.  I definitely understand better now the massive manipulation that serves as a psychological prison, and why kidnap victims simply cannot walk free.  She is an amazing woman and an inspiration; and you just know she is going to be all right.
0307474275|2.0|I don't know whether to give this book two stars or one. Out of kindness I'll make it two. If I were to rate on whether this was a \\"high concept\\" book, on that basis I would give the book five stars: terrific idea! If I were to rate the book on the basis of the writing (sentences, and whether they're dynamic, well-written, correct, and unambiguous), I'd give it a one. But none of those are the main point.<br /><br />The main point is that the author makes an implicit promise in the beginning chapter or chapters: that by reading this book, we will learn where the secret is kept. There's also an implicit promise that the \\"facts\\" in the book are based on historical fact. And, although there is no implicit promise about not revealing the villain, most readers will take it for granted that the bad guy won't be revealed until the end.<br /><br />All three of these promises are broken. We do not learn where the secret is kept, the treasure/proof hidden. I can't tell you how annoyed I was by the author baking away from this: he invented so much, couldn't he have invented a solution?! Nor are the \\"facts\\" historically correct: other reviewers have explained this. Finally, I did not expect, halfway through the book, for the author to change his writing style and the point of view of the characters and the knowledge they should have or should not have, when the villain entered the scene. The author may as well have titled the chapter: \\"This Is the Evil Villain.\\" Everything about this was so obvious that I should have stopped reading.
B004ZQRJFO|1.0|This CD is awful. I bought it because of all the \\" Hype \\" and good reviews it got. And, man, what a let down. First off: on 90% of the songs, they are rapping so fast that you can't comprehend what they are saying. Second: the beats are \\" mediocre \\" at best. I've heard plenty of \\" Mixtapes \\" from various artists that have way better beats than this \\" album \\". So, my review is short and sweet. DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!! You'll be very disappointed: dis·ap·point·ed/'dis''pointid/Adjective<br />1. (of a person) Sad or displeased because someone or something has failed to fulfill one's hopes or expectations.<br /><br />And I mean literally disappointed.
0553801473|2.0|I love this series but this book is a major let down. It is so painfully slow where very little happens and the little that does happen is not that interesting unfortunately.<br /><br />I wish Martin would stop killing off all of the engaging characters in the series leaving us with the less interesting ones. It's hard to get truly invested in the characters when you know it's very likely they'll be killed off in the next book or two.<br /><br />He should have named this book \\"Much Ado about Nothing\\", but unfortunately that title has already been taken by a much better book by a superior author. To be fair, Martin is a gifted writer and I've enjoyed this series greatly. Hopefully he'll redeem himself in the next book.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|Nothing sophisticated abut this court room thriller. Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Haller is the protagonist Lawyer going about business from the back seat of his Lincoln. The cool number plate \\"NTGUILTY\\" even draws attention from the bikies. The movie is a romp and really does not require being taken seriously. Just a fun movie set in LA with the feel of a tv pilot. However, what does set the movie apart from your average tv night is the stellar cast not only the lead but support from Marisa Tomei as the ex Margaret McPherson and William H. Macy as the shoe investigator Frank Levin. if you have a rainy weekend and require to kill time, this is the ideal movie with the odd twist and turn. Don't take popcorn and expect a smooth ride through some parts of LA which have you wondering \\"where is that ?\\"
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is by far the best game I&apos;ve downloaded for my EVO 4G.  Plays identical to the pc game.  I travel a lot for work and have downloaded many games to be &quot;time killers&quot;at airports or on planes.  But I come back to this one the most because it&apos;s got different levels\/scenes that require different types of game play.  Interesting enough to hold my attention for several hours, if needed.  Minor issue...if you put your phone on stand-by when you are in the middle of the game, you&apos;ll have you re-start that level.  But once you know that, you can avoid doing it.  Fun game!
0205313426|5.0|Few books demonstrate their principles with such consistency and clarity as this one does. It repays rereading. You may find more elegant or with-in grammar guides, but none so useful, so chock-full of instances of practical worth. E. B. White was a good writer (see Charlotte's Web) but even his letters are worth reading, and his collections of essays (see The Second Tree From the Corner) are equally worthwhile. He knows whereof he writes! The reader will appropriate in a nuanced manner what suits the moment and the occasion. Hooray for clarity! Hooray for conciseness! Hooray for the right words used in the right way! Can any other guide hold a candle to this one? Not one can.
0765356139|4.0|Plus one to the author for originality in end twists.<br />I suppose I should minus one for the book being over 700 pgs. Really, he could have told just as good or even much better a story if he'd just shaved off 300 pgs.<br />The detractors who complain about there not being much plot advancement for a large chunk of the book are absolutely correct. It didn't bother me so much though becuase I read the book over about 6 months. That I was still interested in the book after all that time is a feat in and of itself and most of the reason for the high rating.<br /><br />The ending is annoying. It's not exactly a feel good sort of ending, but then again, it's just book 2 in a trilogy, so it's not truly \\"the end.\\"<br /><br />*spoilers ahead*<br />Vin and Elend get lied to several times. Most of the original crew is dead by book's end. Vin pushes her powers to the limits and helps turn the tide for Luthadel. Vin does the wrong thing by doing the right thing. Sazed finds and loses love and becomes highly disenchanted as a result.<br /><br />The complexity of this story is refreshing. I do look forward to reading the conclusion. Brevity is certainly not Sanderson's forte. Characters are a strong point for him though, the series would be a neat video game.
B00081U6EG|1.0|I bought this DVD after seeing it on cable.  It will not play in either my DVD or Blu-ray player.  It looks like it's the wrong regional coding.  FYI
B004LWZW24|4.0|Like others mentioned, this is the first good horror film to come out in a while. It starts out slowly, almost on the verge of being boring, and quickly turns into a spook-fest. I enjoyed the build up and anticipation much more than the generic slasher thrillers, and was legitimately creeped out by some scenes.     Parts of the movie come off as a little hokey, but overall it was a great horror film. The ending was awesome, in my opinion, and I recommend Insidious to anyone wanting to see a surprisingly decent horror flick.
B000WPAG1Q|5.0|Christina Aguilera delivers EVERY TIME!<br /><br />This woman is the best singer of our Generation...<br /><br />Great concert performance and she doesn't lip sync like all the other pop stars... Britney, Beyonce, etc...
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Not to pile on, but this is 3-stars, and 3 primarily because I am so invested in the characters off the credit of the first three books that I still cared what happened to them. Love the series. Tolerated the fourth book. I would argue this was even worse than the fourth. The criticism of the fourth, besides little advancement of the primary plot, was it focused on the characters we didn't care as much about. True. But I did come around to caring a bit. This book does the opposite - it actually made me care less about some of my favorite characters. It is sad the way he diminishes Dany's story. Or the way he spends most of the book showing what a strong leader Jon is only to have him act illogically near the end. Or the way Tyrion does almost nothing at all except loath in self-pity. Only when he starts negotiating for himself at the end does he show any spark of his old self at all and it is but a few pages.<br /><br />In its defense, each book seems to introduce a new societal consequence to highlight. The fourth focused on the reemergence of religion in the chaos and leadership void. This one on the unintended consequences of disrupting the slave trade and societal order. I'm glad he finds room for these expansion themes amidst the plotting and characters.  He is still a good written and overall amazing \\"world builder.\\"  But he's definitely lost momentum and gotten bogged down. He needed a strong editor as a full and empowered partner and clearly didn't have that influence.<br /><br />At this point there is no way all the characters and sub-plots he has introduced will have satisfying full arcs.  It's one thing to complicate a story and another to burden it with a thousand points of light. He'll need to start abruptly killing characters off without real purpose in mass.  It is the \\"Lost\\" equivalent of having a hundred Walts - `hey, look the kid is special, oh wait, never mind, we decided to go a different way so we'll just send him home...'
B001P3SA94|5.0|Loved the story, loved the casting, loved the music, loved everything about this movie!<br /><br />So I bought it!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The pacific shows the war in the pacific through the eyes of three marines. It is an absolute masterpiece. There are many sad scenes like the part when.... woops I have said to much. I am a bit of a blabber mouth when it comes to movies so I will sum this up with one word: Epic.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|First let me start by saying get ready. This album is an intelligent, sci-fi, sexy, romanitic masterpiece. She has really toke the listening experience to the next level. All you need is a decent pair of headphones, so that you can hear every detail within her layers of talent. She has really restored my faith in the abilty of new artist. This is a definite must buy.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Battle: Los Angeles tells the story of a sqaud of marines during an alien invasion of los angeles. It is a great story with great character. If your debating on whether or not to buy it, buy it.
1594744769|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a welcome diversion from the usual type of fantasy novel.<br />It takes an ordinary sort of guy & places him in an unbelieveable place.<br />Along the way highlighting the fear & prejudice within us all for the those different to the \\"norm\\".<br />I found it a refreshing change, a quick read & yes, obvious it's to be followed by a sequel.<br />The writing wasn't the best but it deserves the stars for the imagination behind so unusual a story.<br />Will very likely read the next installment.
0439023491|5.0|i really enjoyed this book! its one of those series  that u can re read over and over again!
B003I55BIA|5.0|This is such a sweet love story between two well developed characters.  The author really pulls you into their every day lives and makes you care what happens to Brittany and Alex.  They weren't the stereotypical characters who all of sudden grew through their love for one another.  Britney and Alex were already two caring individuals who let each other into their lives and fell in love.  I couldn't put the book down and kept cheering them on to their happy ending.
B003PAXONC|5.0|I was impressed when received this Gift Set for I Am Legend. I realized it was not a small box from the pics, but didn't expect this quality. The movie, everyone knows so no need to rate it, so leaves us the packaging. The box could be a little more solid, but it is enough to protect the contents. The booklet with production pictures is very beautiful even showing pictures not from the theatrical release. The poster cards showing several cities after the outbreak, with tones of gold is impressive and the collectible lenticular is very nice, although too many frames, so you need to turn a lot to see all the scene. And the disc packagin, openning like a book, is very solid.    I didn't have a chance to watch everything or the alternate version (although I've watched the alternate ending online years ago), but this is a must for collector's that want something else for a favorite movie. I know that some people didn't like this movie at all, but for those who liked, just buy. You won't regret.
B0015AARJI|5.0|What can I say that had not been said about this wireless controller for PS3?... Well, I'd agree with all of those gamers that say this is a great controller. I bought it for my old PS3 console (80Gb huge console I might say hehehehe) and I must say just one thing: this controller seems slightly heavier than my current controller (the one that came with the ps3 console). Why? I don't know. Does it feel right when it comes to play?... Of course!!... But the weight difference just caught my attetion. It looks more strong or robust (so to speak) compared to the controller I already have. It doesn't make any difference when it's time to play though... As I said before, it feels right.<br />I know there are some other controllers from different brands but I still prefer the \\"original\\" ones, by Sony.<br />No complaints about the packaging... excellent product!!... Five stars.
B002L19FH0|5.0|This album, when it was first released, was just as good if not better (in my opinion) than Kid A, and still ranks as probably my favorite Radiohead album.  Then, the collectors edition adds tracks like Fog, Cutthroat, and the live version of Like Spinning Plates, which make this release simply unstoppable.  I honestly cannot comprehend how anyone could give this less than 3, even 4 stars...everyone is entitled to their musical opinions, of course, but I am also welcome to have my opinion ABOUT those opinions.  I firmly believe that those who complain about Radiohead albums that don't fit the mold of The Bends and OK Computer as stubborn and unwilling to adapt or evolve their musical tastes.  Which is fine for them, but they're only hurting themselves for missing out on some truly fantastic experimental/ambient/genre-crossing work by one of them most prolific and talented bands of the last 30 years.  All the greatest bands in history changed with the times, expanded their own musical boundaries, and challenged their listeners.  Anyone looking at this album, please don't be discouraged by the one-star reviews...give it a chance.
0345529057|4.0|I have just finished \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" and I enjoyed it.  The story is one of political intrigue and fantasy that is suspenseful and entertaining.  The cunning and deception of the characters naturally reflects the author's talent for storytelling.  The story is, of course, the most important thing.    However, I started this immediately after reading Tolkien for three months, and in comparing the two there is just no question.  The immersion and simple writing quality that Tolkien provides is just not apparent with Martin.  As far as fantasy worlds go, that of SoIaF pales in comparison, and a lot of the \\"history\\" of the world seems crudely thrown together.  Furthermore, the writing is of a somewhat lesser quality.  I find myself unable to imagine what this world and its people look like based on the author's descriptions.  Adjectives (such as \\"sweet\\") are reused far too often.  The vocabulary is simple.    Overall, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" was quite good, and it is perhaps unfair to compare it to Tolkien's works.  I truly believe that if I hadn't just spent three months in Middle Earth, the problems mentioned above, although still noticeable, would not have detracted from my enjoyment nearly as much.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|Mark Russinovich, a security expert at Microsoft, authors a novel of real-life suspense in the security-vulnerable tech industry. Russinovich knows from first hand experience how vulnerable government, business, and everyday life is to cyber-attack resulting from our heavy dependence on computers and the Internet. This novel set in today's world, tells a \\"what-if\\" story of a pending binary doomsday and reveals what would happen if the fiction became fact. The author does a good job of developing characters and drawing the reader into their lives and emotions. If you like suspenseful novels of espionage, intrigue, and treachery with a tech twist, this is a novel you must read.
B002ZG981E|4.0|Fascinating tricky film must be watched very carefully or you will get lost in it's complex plot of dreams within dreams.  Nolan and his team create some truly stunning images. He truly earns the now over used term of visionary director. If you like thought provoking sci-fi then this is one worth watching.
B003Y5H542|3.0|Exquisite in its particulars, the animated RANGO stumbles in most of its bigger picture issues.  Any pretext of dramatically coherent storytelling with emotionally engaging characters is left in RANGO's desert dust.  Instead, director Gore Verbinski delivers an eye-popping smorgasbord of glib cleverness and over-done homage.    With its unique look and meticulous attention to detail, there is almost always something remarkable to look at in RANGO.  But in this tale of a domesticated chameleon, Rango (Johnny Depp), abandoned by a near auto accident in the Mojave Desert, who stumbles upon the parched town of Dirt and becomes its de facto sheriff, did I ever care all that much about what was going on?  Not really.  The main problem is that the screenplay by John Logan (GLADIATOR, Spielberg's upcoming LINCOLN), from a story by Logan, Verbinski and James Byrkit, doesn't build the characters or events into a satisfying whole.  Also, this ostensible comedy is never very funny.  You might chuckle to yourself here and there, but the movie doesn't evoke many real laughs.    Given Verbinski's track record helming the first three inexplicably popular PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movies, the results here are not unexpected.  Like those live-action cartoons, RANGO is visually impressive with a difficult-to-follow story that builds to obligatory action set-pieces, populated by characters in which the audience has virtually no emotional investment.  But RANGO is also hampered by one other aspect - its over-reliance on a steady stream of pop culture references (though I'm sure the filmmakers would call it hommage).     The main plot is a complete rip-off of CHINATOWN, complete with mysteriously diverted water and a bad guy mayor (Ned Beatty) closely modeled on John Huston's Noah Cross.  The character of the Spirit of the West (voiced by Timothy Olyphant), who inspires Rango to action in the third act, is Clint Eastwood.  From Sergio Leone to STAR WARS to Carlos Castaneda's Don Juan to Barney Fife, the movie becomes an exercise in \\"spot the allusion.\\"  And when the plot veers into head-scratching, \\"what's going on?\\" territory (like in the characters' brief view of Las Vegas), the audience is further removed from the experience.    Despite these criticisms, the animated world of RANGO offers a treasure trove of visual pleasures.  With the bar set so high over the last several years of CGI development, the art, animation and effects teams have done an extraordinary job in creating a living, breathing, visually stunning world.  While the bug-eyed Rango and the denizens of Dirt, mostly desert-dwelling reptiles and small mammals, are not necessarily attractive, they are unique character creations that are true to their world.  Visual credit must also be shared by the brilliant Roger Deakins (cinematographer of TRUE GRIT, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and many, many more) for his contributions to the film's striking look.
B002ZG9800|5.0|I was hesitant to watching this because I thought it would be lame.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it very entertaining.  It was much more complex than I thought it would be.  Yeah, yeah it's got two men in it who love each other, but its a lot more than that.  It's funny.  It's witty and wise.  The acting is fantastic.  As long as you're comfortable with your sexuality enough to get past the two men having sexual and romantic relations then give this a shot.  I'm sure you'll find it to be well done.  It's a great love story about what a con man and the guy he loves.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I love it. This was a great purchase and a great price. I am enjoying every minute of the series!
B003ITZBVS|5.0|Batman: Under the Red Hood was better than I thought it would be, the animation was good but not great, and the story was very good. I was afraid I had wasted my money on another bad dvd. I was surprised to find that it was really a good story even though the joker was didn't have very many shining moments. The animation was typical for a batman animated film but was not something to get excited about. The thing about this dvd that got me truly interested was the story. the opposing veiws in the philosophy of Batman and Red Hood were what created the conflict in this story. overall it was a really good dvd.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|When this film was in production, I was very excited for it. The reason was because of the interesting theme of Cowboys mixed with Aliens. Who better to be Executive Producer than Steven Spielberg, the king of alien films. Also, on the Cowboy side, you have acting legend Harrison Ford, who wonderfully portrays a Cowboy. With Damon Lindelof, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci doing the Screenplay, I had no doubts that \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\" would at very least be interesting.    For a general plot summary, the film begins with Daniel Craig's character (Jake Lonergan) waking up in the middle of the dessert, with a steel bracelet on his arm. He wonders into the nearest town, where he discovers that mysterious, alien-like spacecrafts have been taking people and his bracelet is the only weapon that damages the Aliens.  Meanwhile, rich cattle owner Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) discovers the aliens have captured his son, so Lonergan and himself lead an attack on the Alien base.    Overall, \\"Cowboys & Aliens\\" is a very entertaining and enjoyable film. Both Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford turn in great performances, which makes the film great!

030746363X|4.0|I have only read the chapters in this book about the slow carb diet/losing fat, but I am seeing results.  I have been following the diet carefully for two weeks now and am down 5 lb!  I am not really overweight (5'7\\" @ 152 lb) and so I don't have that much weight to lose, so I will say that.  I had a baby a year ago and have had trouble getting down to my \\"pre-pregnancy\\" weight.  I've mainly tried calorie restriction diets and just cannot stick with them because I can't stand always being hungry and feeling low on energy.  I've also tried Jenny Craig but I got sick of the food and I like to eat out a lot, which you can't really do on JC.     I eat two eggs for breakfast with refried beans and salsa and I am barely hungry for lunch. It is time-consuming, though, and so I've started boiling a bunch of eggs once a week and eat those for breakfast.  I eat a huge salad with lots of chicken, steak or shrimp OR I do the naked burrito at Chipotle or Qdoba.  And then I grill chicken, steak or fish for dinner and have corn on the cob or some fresh cooked veggies with it.  I, for the first time in my life, don't usually have to snack because I'm so satiated.  But on the few occasions I do need to snack, I eat a beef stick or a handful of nuts.  And I get all my cravings in on the once a week cheat day!  I also have stopped working out during this diet and am still experiencing weight loss.  I will probably start working out again just to be healthy and speed up the weight loss a bit.     Pros:  - Rarely hungry (and if I am, I know I need to eat larger portions at each meal!)  - CAn eat out pretty easily  - Doesn't require much self-control (although turning down bread & pasta isn't hard for me)  - I am seeing RESULTS! (lost 5 lb. in 2 weeks)  - CAn still drink red wine every night?!  yes, please!    Cons:  - I do miss dairy and fruit  - I do get sick of eating eggs  - Will I gain all the weight back once I go off this diet?  - Time-consuming breakfasts, although there are other options for this    Overall, it seems to be working and with minimal sacrifice and effort! I haven't seen these numbers on the scale in over 2 years and so every weigh in day, I just want to cry out of pure joy. I don't feel like I'm working that hard or giving much up and so I'm in disbelief when I see I've lost weight each week.   I am going to keep going until I hit my pre-pregnancy weight... only 5 lb. to go.    I want to also say, my husband is following it as carefully as me, and he has not seen significant weight loss in the 3 weeks he's been on it.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|Forget for the moment that Trek fans are among the most passionate of fans. Forget for the moment this film makes certain conceits that may be a bit hard to stomach. Forget for the moment that it has been a while since anyone has seen the characters involved wherein. Now, take a deep breath.<br /><br />Strap in your TVs and BD players, 'cause they're in for a hell of a ride. Enjoy it.<br /><br />Problematic plot aside, this new installment of Trek has a number of things going for it. The actors are beyond reproach in their respective rolls and to some extent, uncannily so. The visuals and sound fx are mind-blowing and not carbon copied from previously released and still seemingly successful ventures (TNG films, I'm looking at you). The mantra of this film was, as stated by the crew in the special features, \\"How can we make it real... and cool?\\"<br /><br />In the script component - the most heavily reviled aspect of the film - falls into the literary device of the dream story. In Trek, this means it deals with time travel. As hard as it may be, if you can turn off your Trek-Trivia stocked brain and let it all go into the wind (I know, it's hard to do), and watch the characters. They are the reason to watch this film.<br /><br />Okay, and the visuals are sweet.<br /><br />The special features are the best I have seen in this format, if only for the fact that they have a subtitle track. Being partially deaf, subtitled features are kind of a must for me.<br /><br />At the end of the day, when we watch this version of Star Trek, we see the cast and crew boldly go where no sane Trek fan might go. And isn't that why we all love Trek in the first place?

0312360266|1.0|This book is horrible. A coworker of mine also like YA books, so she told me to give this series a try. After only a few pages I knew this was going to be a stinker. I have only stopped reading a book once before, and I got 2/3 of the way through that one. I could only take this one for 6 chapters and had to call it quits. I hate Zoey and find her dialogue highly annoying. I don't need to read \\"(hee hee)\\" after every (not) funny line. This book is very childish and is not worth your time. Look at all the other negative reviews and save yourself some trouble by skipping this one.<br /><br />Read some Women of the Otherworld books instead. Now there is a quality series.
0553801473|5.0|This is one of the greatest series of all time. The writing is still top notch with the exception of some spelling/grammar errors that no self respecting editor should have let slip. My only complaint is, like many others have said, not much happens plot-wise and there are too many cliffhangers. In my initial reading of the book I was disappointed by the introduction of what could be a very important character in a very shallow way but--given some time to think about it-- I think this \\"weak\\" introduction of the character was intentional by Martin and there will be a more satisfying, alternate explanation in the coming book. (I don't believe that this character is who people think he is.)
0553801473|2.0|GRRM has created an unwieldy mess with Dance with Dragons. It started with Storm of Swords and continued with Feast for Crows. He's done nothing to resolve it and only added to the mess by creating more meaningless characters and trite plot twists (can you say baby switched at birth-really?). You say you wanted some resolution with DWD? Sorry. You're not going to get it. However, if you enjoy about 1000 pages of characters you know (and may love) and characters you don't know and don't care about doing nothing but traveling (literally - yes, they do nothing but plod along dirt roads for 3/4 of the book), then maybe this book is for you. I, for one, have decided that I am probably done with GRRM/ASOIF. I gave up on Robert Jordan and Frank Herbert. And, sadly, I think GRRM is headed that way too.

B0019IB26I|4.0|I am a huge fan of live recordings and this one is done well, it is tight and the sound is true to life.  I always thought John Mayer was a little 'soft rock\\" but this is a strong album, it is a trio but not a classic power trio and doesnt feel like its all about John setting himself up as a guitar hero which he isnt. The playing is tight but relaxed and the singing is strong, not as in depth as the double live album but a great collections with a good live feel well worth listening. Ray

B000BJS4SU|5.0|This is by far the best of the live John Mayer albums, not strictly the trio but it is the trio that drives the album.

B0000067L2|3.0|I'm a musician myself, I play guitar, and tutoring yound bands. I'm a huge fan of eifferent rock, prog and metal bands. I can deffinetly appreciate some good playing and compositions.    Anyway, I have to say that this album is pretty mediocre. I'll detail:  1. The playing. While I think Clapton is an amazing guitarist, and that not it vain is he regarded as one of the most influental guitarists of all time, I do think he was quite an amateur when he recorded his takes on this album. You can hear that the pitchs of his bends are not accurate, his overdubbing in the solo tracks are far from tight, and his overall sound and playing is not quite as good as it would get - it's actually kinda sloppy sometimes.   Baker and Bruce are doing their jobs well, yet their playing is very basic. one could expect more creativity, and boldness, or even a better \\"feel\\" from musicians as highly-acclaimed as they are.    2. The compositions - while this album is largely regarded as an psychedelic album, the songs are all in the vain of pop-rock songs, some bluesier than othres, but none of them containing any original musical ideas, mind-blowing jamming or interesting arragements.     3. The sound and recording quality is OK at best, even when compared to other recordings from that time.     I think it's not so much of a revalation to say that these three young musicians were pretty unripe at the days Disraeli Gears was recorded. However, this doesn't mean that they won't mature and grow into being the amazing musicians they were on later years (Clapton in particular). The Blind Faith cd, recorded not 2 years later, already sees immense improvement from both Clapton and Baker.     If you're now getting into the Blues-Rock/Psychedelic genre or into Eric Clapton, I suggest starting with something a little bit older than Disraeli Gears, such as the aforementioned Blind Faith, Derek & The Dominos, Clapton's solo works, or even Cream's Wheels of Fire.

B00000JXHB|5.0|After being a fan for 36 years, my LPs and cassettes finally wore out. Can't remember if I had an 8-track as well.  It's great to have this collection at arm's reach.

B005D63RQK|5.0|To start iwth, let me say that it continues to amaze me how many people I run into who still have not seen the show Breaking Bad. It has won so many award, it has incredibly great actors with Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, the storyline is great, and it is overall one of the best shows on TV.  Enough of the rant--onto Season 4!  So it feels as if it has been quite a while between Seasons 3 and 4 and when I saw that it was back on, I danced a small jig and prepared to download the episodes and watch.  \\"Jesse\\" is really the star of the show in the first two episodes. He goes from being the big party guy to sitting on the floor crying. He continues to not be super sure who he is or what he wants to be. Almost like he wants to break out of the rut he is in but doesnt know how.  Dean Norris plays brother-in-law Hank who continues to recover from a shooting in the previous season and has taken up an interesting new hobby collecting \\"rocks.\\" Finally, it is not super clear in the early episodes how Walt and Skyler are going to pan out in terms of their \\"marriage\\" but one can imagine that sorting itself out this season.  This really is a great show that has taken many twists and turns but continues to be super interesting and compelling appointment TV.

140053271X|5.0|I went on the market and started doing my research with one goal in mind. Find an e-book reader. I was tempted by the more tablet-ey devices, but what it came down to is anything that a tablet could do, my android based phone was more than capable of handling. I wanted a device that I could read outside in bright Texas sunshine between classes, or cuddle up before bed under a light with...    Like 99% of people out there, it came down to the Kindle vs the Nook...They both boast pretty much the exact same screen, with the exact same size...the Kindle just has the added physical keyboard while the Nook uses a touch interface so simple/intuitive my grandmother was handling it naturally within minutes.    The differences in the available markets did not concern me, as all my books are sourced through 3rd party providers, and my library is managed on my computer by a program called Calibre (pronounced Caliber for us Americans).    The screen is crisp, very little ghosting, and it only does the black/white screen flash every 6th page turn...something I hardly notice. The unit itself is incredibly light, lighter than a standard paperback, and has a rubberized finish that holds well in my average-to-smaller hands for a guy. The two buttons on either side of the screen are a little hard to push at first, but I've noticed that over the past week, the two I use most have \\"worn in\\" and, while still requiring a small amount of tension, are plenty comfortable to activate even in a late-night delirious stupor brought on by a case of the one-more-chapter's.    Also, due to the touch interface, I find that no matter how I hold the unit, or using whichever hand, I can easily navigate pages. You can page foreward by either hitting one of the two side buttons, tapping the right side of the screen, or making a swipe motion ANYWHERE on the screen.    Amazon may have the slightly larger market, but B&N is definitely winning in the hardware race for best simple tablet.
1932100660|5.0|I was your average American, believing everything I had heard about eating and nutrition and following along, blindly, without ever questioning the facts behind the information. I thought heart disease and diabetes would be inevetible because I saw it all around me. I had never looked into my eating habits. I didn't realize I was living in a country with the highest rates of PREVENTABLE diseases!    This book changed my perspetive about eating, health and nutrition. I became a vegetarian, started eating, and feeding my family, healthier and even went back to college to get a degree in nutrition because I was so fascinated and astonished with the knowledge this book shares! My husband and I are middle-aged but no longer have high cholesterol or blood sugar issues on a plant-based diet and neither of our teenage children are overweight or have any health problems. This book moved me to change careers and my life. This book has information that can help change your health and your life in positive ways!
0143118757|5.0|I read this as philosophy student in college.  It's more relevant now than ever.  It should be read by anyone in government, especially today.
159514188X|1.0|I am only halfway through the book and got on Amazon to read reviews to see if I should continue forcing myself to read this book or to give up on it.  I had such high expectations but have not found it compelling so far.    Apparently I am the only person who thinks it is poorly written aside from the choppiness of moving between Clay and Hannah's voices.    Things I don't like:  1.  Clay is not only too goody-goody, he is a wimp--he climbed up the rocket slide ONCE in his life, when he was five and \\"cried his head off\\" so his dad CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT to get him down!  I don't know a boy who wouldn't go down a rocket slide at some point in his life.  2.  Poor writing--Things are too foreshadowed, for example, Skye.  Obviously something bad has happened to her and she will be included in the story again.  3.  I agreed with one reviewer who said \\"if these were Hannah's thirteen reasons, then 25% of every high school class should be looking for a way to end it.\\"  Why not make the bullying more pronounced?  Sadly so many kids endure so much more.  4.  The characters are boring, whiny, and I don't care about any of them thus far.    Will I finish the book?  I think I have better things to read.
1594744769|5.0|Jacob's life has been pretty ordinary. The most excitement he has is his grandfather's fantastical tales about a home he lived in. In this place, he said, there were girls who could float and boys who had bees living inside them. All the children that didn't fit in anywhere else came here. They were watched over by an old bird. Jacob doesn't believe that these are 100% true tales, and eventually stops listening. When his grandfather dies under very mysterious circumstances and Jacob sees something in the woods, he starts to wonder if maybe his grandfather was crazy, and if maybe he has gone crazy too. Jacob can't get his grandfathers final words out of his head, so he searches for the things that were mentioned. This leads Jacob to a mysterious island near Europe with his father. Here Jacob figures he can learn some pieces of the truth about his grandfather, and the peculiar children he once knew.<br /><br />Wow. This book was so different from the typical YA fare. It still had an angsty teen boy in it, but he was intelligent and had a great mystery set out before him. The pictures were all quite peculiar and some downright creepy (like the clown-twins pictured on the back cover). Ransom Rigg's wrote Jacob very well, he had lots of emotions and questions and was just a fantastic and touching character. I loved the stories his grandfather told about the peculiar children. I only wish Jacob's grandfather was in the book more often, he seemed like an offbeat kinda guy. All the character's came to life, and I loved the description of the island. It sounds like a presently dreadful place to be. It added a great element of dreary suspicion to the whole story. I think this is a fantastic novel for all sorts of people. It's contemporary, has paranormal aspects, magic and a creep-factor with plenty of mysteries to keep you tied up.<br /><br />First Line:<br />\\"I had just come to accept that my life would be ordinary when extraordinary things began to happen.\\"<br /><br />Favorite Line:<br />\\"It was an almost-too-perfect morning.\\"n almost-too-perfect morning.\\"
B001YQGRCY|4.0|Kasabian have really stepped up to the plate on this their third studio album the strangely titled West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum. Following on from their last two albums the good self titled debut and the decent second album Empire, Kasabian deliver a quality third album.     Kasabian have always had great tunes but with this album they have a complete piece with hardly any filler. Songwriter Sergio Pizzorno will now have to be taken seriously as a songwriter. The album is full of big stomping tunes, the kind that Kasabian specialise in. Album opener Underdog sets things up nicely with its big chorus. The standout tracks are Thick as Thieves, Vlad the Impaler, Secret Alphabets and Fire. The best track on the album is Fast Fuse which is a song you will revisit plenty of times. Another bold tack is West Ryder Silver Bullet which features actress Rosario Dawson sharing vocal duties with lead singer Tom Meighan its an idea that shouldn't really work but the results are great.     The special cd/dvd edition is that rare thing in that its worth spending that bit extra to get as the dvd included has two separate live gigs performed by the band you also getting a making of the video feature and the cool video for Vlad the Impaler, its also comes in a nice case with gold lettering.     This should be the album that takes Kasabian to the next step and it will be interesting to see how they can top this.

The story was slow paced and the main character felt lacking.<br /><br />I love horror flicks and live for them, Insidious had me fall asleep 3 times during the movie and this was when the \\"scary\\" parts were about to happen.<br /><br />I tossed the Bluray to a friend, told him to keep it and to never give it back.

B0059R5Q08|3.0|I usually never write reviews for movies but before because i am only 17 decided a while back ago not to watch it because it seemed old dark and stupid. Well I love Jane Austens book, They take a very happy approach to things. I've always heard that the Bronte sisters are known for they're morbid stories. So i decided to watch this since it has Mia from Alice In Wonderland. It was really really good. The actors were very good looking and handsome. I wish it would have shown a little more development at the end with the little girl and the mother. It would have been nice to know more you know? I really loved the scenes and the beautiful views you got they were just amazing, beyond anything i've seen. the flashbacks are a little bit to much, It's just a little bit scattered and sometimes hard to understand. But it is a movie worth watching for especially for you Jane Austen and Bronte fans! it's a twist of dark and love.

B004XQO90O|4.0|\\"Source Code\\" is director Duncan Jones' second feature film, after the existential science fiction drama \\"Moon\\" (2009) took viewers back to the thoughtful sci-fi of the 1970s. Elements of that style are in evidence in the unretouched look of \\"Source Code\\", which, in spite of its contemporary setting, shares some of the same themes. Capt. Colter Stephens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a Chicago-bound commuter train not knowing where he is or how he got there. The last thing he remembers was being a helicopter pilot with the 17th Airborne in Afghanistan. Now he sits opposite a woman named Christina (Michelle Monaghan), who calls him Sean and seems friendly. Colter's reflection in the mirror is unfamiliar to him, and, before he can figure it out, the train explodes in a fiery ball.<br /><br />Now Colter is strapped into a capsule as a woman speaks to him through a monitor screen about an operation called Beleaguered Castle. She tries to help him regain cogent thought processes. Her name is Capt. Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), and she explains that the train he was just on exploded this morning, killing those aboard. Colter's mission is to go back and find the bomber, so a second terrorist attack can be prevented. He has 8 minutes. He's not traveling back in time, but into the residual memories of a man who was killed on the train. And so Colter goes back to the train, Christina, the explosion, the capsule, Capt. Goodwin. Again and again, as he hunts for the bomber, an understanding of himself, and of the implications of the technology that enables him.<br /><br />It reminded me of \\"Moon\\" in its identity crisis and artificial reality, constructed for the benefit, or imprisonment, of the protagonist. This has a slicker, action-movie tone, though, rather than the contemplative pace of 1970s sci-fi. There is romance, action, and existentialism. And \\"Source Code\\", the mind-bending fusion of quantum mechanics and neurobiology that sends Colter into a dead man's memories, is billed as \\"a powerful weapon in the War on Terror.\\" I felt the ending was a bit of a cop-out, and I'm not sure that it makes sense. But Colter's existential adventure does make sense, and there is enough action to keep the audience engaged even though, like our protagonist, we keep ending up back on the same train. Duncan Jones is now two-for-two and a promising talent.<br /><br />The DVD (Summit Entertainment 2011): There are 2 featurettes, an optional Trivia Track that you can run during the film, and an audio commentary. \\"Cast and Crew Insights\\" (35 min) interviews cast and director about themes, characters, and each other, in 11 parts.

The caracters are very well casted with great star-power and everything is set up for a sequel or more, so it is too sad that there hasn't been done more.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I went with my teenage daughters to see this as they had been looking forward to it for months.  They loved it, as anime fans they were in heaven with the costumes and over the top action.  Yes the ending was very sad, and it did feel a bit rushed but honestly I also enjoyed the movie and am puzzled as to why it has been so trashed.  It's made by the 300 guy, what were critics expecting, a Merchant Ivory sitting room drama?  My only gripe is that to achieve a PG-13 rating, much of the film's darker elements or scenes were deleted.  The extended cut is a better film and I think if it had been left in it's original form it would have done better in theaters.  If you liked Sin City, 300 or even Kill Bill I think you will dig Sucker Punch.

This one is marvellous, with many scenes taken for the first time. There are a lot of familiar facts, but filmed in completely new way and that is what makes this series exciting to watch. All that, followed by the familiar voice of one and only David Attenborough, it will leave anyone in a bewildered owe!  Thanks BBC, once again!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|The reviews for this book were too harsh.  I was very satisfied by the pace and plot of Dance.  There is a lot that still needs to happen in the series, but I think this book sets them up well and DOES evolve the characters quite a bit.  I am satisfied and eagerly await book 6!
0486479110|4.0|I am obsessed with illustrators and the cheeky little book: \\"Lyrics Pathetic from A to Z\\", by Dulac caught my eye.<br />This book has snatches of all the major themes of Dulac's body of work, including I was thrilled to find- 6 letters B, D, K, L, N, Q.<br /><br />The darker, gray tone illustrations, including the cover, are quite fuzzy, but the lighter ones are sharp.  I am not sure if this was unavoidable given the 12\\" X 10\\" size of the reproduction.<br /><br />But it definitely is easier to study the details in these larger-size illustrations.<br /><br />I think I will keep this for the sheer breadth of themes.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I read this book in two nights.  The book was well thought out and written.  The ending left it  open for a second book.  I hope the author takes the hint and writes a second book so we know what  happens to Jacob and the peculier children and if they find the other loops and the other peculiar.  I read this on the kindel.  The only problem doing that was you had a hard time reading the two photographed letters.  The photos are great and the story wonderful.  Hope you give this a read.  The book was very hard to put down.......  Hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.

B004WOS7LO|5.0|This Loud Morning is a Masterpiece, IMO!  With every listen it just gets better and better.  Even the few songs that in the first listen I thought might be \\"throw away\\" songs have now grown to become some of my favorites.  This album is like entering a dream and sharing all the facets of love and loss with DC.  It demands to be listened to as a whole --- it's the proverbial \\"the whole is more than the sum of its parts\\" album!  It's an absolutely incredible album that continues to grow and grow and grow on the listener.  You won't be able to keep from humming these songs over and over in your head.  This album should be a contender for \\"Album of the Year\\"!!!  Where can I cast my vote???
0393061310|5.0|Informative written book about why some societies develop differently.  Personally, the book was an eye opener, and I enjoyed every page of it.  The reader will learn that societal differences have nothing to do with innate traits but instead with environmental factors, etc. This book should be required reading, history, geography for 10th high school graders.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|vampire Diaries season 1 is an exciting series that keeps you interested every step of the way.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes to get lost in fantasy every now and then.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my mother, who absolutely loved it.  Classic Christmas flick, and great for getting you into the spirit of the season.  It has the original black and white version, with some more recent documentaries on the film.  Really great version.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Love this keyboard. super prediction, excellent spelling correction, and very well placed keys. In particular I like that you get a 3 by 3 grid for numbers on the second page instead of just 1 row across the top. \nI wish I could move the period key to the other side of the space bar because I&apos;ll often hit it instead of the space key with my right thumb. I do this on every keyboard I&apos;ve ever used so I don&apos;t blame SwiftKey. Some times if I long press the backspace key it won&apos;t continue to delete characters, just one.

0553386794|1.0|Was this really compared to J.R.R Tolkien's masterpiece? If this series didn't have such a huge folowing, I would think it was a joke of a comparison!<br /><br />After 110 pages, there are already three sex scenes. The first was more of an after sex scene which I thought was well done and showed Eddard and Cathlyn's relationship. I liked that. But then we get to the incest on pages 84 and 85. Listen dude I understand if you want to stick with the times but why in the world do you have to be so descriptive? I don't want to read about a brother burying his face in sister's breast and hanging down low and hurting her. It was unnecessary. I know the Lannisters are suppose to be evil characters but from the descriptions, you get a sick feeling that the author actually enjoys writing about incest. Finally, let's not forget Dany and Drogo making love on page 108: \\"She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs\\" and \\"Yes,\\" she whispered as she put his fingers inside her.\\"<br /><br />Wtf? This is child pornography. If Martin wanted to go with smut, he should have done it with Eddard and Cathelyn and not some thirteen-year-old girl! He did not need to be that descriptive.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this sharpener to go along with my gerber prodigy knife.  I am impressed witht he knife and it's build and this sharpener didn't disappoint either.

I'm glad I got this and it's coming with me whenever I go for a hike.
B000000XCH|3.0|I've always loved this CD! it is one of my all-time favorites and truly a classic.     That said, I'm very wary of remasters in general. I just picked up this CD and didn't know it was a remaster until I started listening to it. It doesn't sound \\"right\\" to me. It doesn't sound like the album I used to have way back when. I can't exactly put my finger on it, but to me it sounds kind of \\"thin\\", and the echo effects from the original mix seem exaggerated to me. It seems like the desire to remaster a CD almost always results in (IMHO) in a CD that only passingly resembles the original, sonically, and I feel like this remaster fits in the same category.     I also noticed that the song, \\"Before You Accuse Me\\", is NOT what was originally on the LP and the radio. It is some alternate blues version they did. (Either that or my sonic memory is bad). I HATE it when they mess with the song versions!    I'm going to find the original mastered version and see if I like that better, and I'll update this review accordingly.
1596912367|5.0|I haven't read a lot of spy novels, so I'm not sure how this one stacks up in the genre, but it was a FANTASTIC read. Mysterious and interesting, but not too dense. Good summer/airplane read (but I don't say that to knock it). It is literary without being obtuse. Mystery lovers will like this one.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I'm not entirely sure how low my temps should be, but in the evening (when it's coolest in my room) my temps idle around 42C. During the day (I live in the Arizona heat), it idles around 46C.<br />I haven't really tried pushing the cpu too hard yet (I'm only currently overclocking at 3.6ghz on an i5 2500k), but so far the temps seem to do pretty well.<br /><br />I have a second 120mm fan so that I have a full push-pull cooling system and that would definitely be recommended.<br /><br />One downside to this cooler, it's REALLY tall. There are some huge CPU coolers out there but this one extended almost an inch and half over my previous cpu cooler for my core2duo (Arctic Cooler), and I had to cut some of my side case that holds some case fans off (CM Stacker 830). That was a definite downer. Due to this, I have a Corsair h60 on its way to replace this cpu cooler in hopes that the noise level reduces and more temp drops when I overclock soon.
B004EC5IUW|4.0|The movie is in 1080p HD quality, as promised. It looks fantastic on the two blu-ray players and three televisions I've watched it on. The box-art and sleeve look fantastic in my collection. The movie itself is pretty good, even though I prefer the original TV series and the first film to this one. An issue I had with this, however, are the subtitles. They are a mustard-yellow with no real black edges which make them blend into the picture and make them hard to see at times (especially when sitting far away from the TV). The English dub is also done by different voice actors than the TV anime was, as well, and are noticeably worse than the original dub.
B003X27L9U|1.0|Let's start off with the good. The idea of this book was absolutely captivating and the author was onto something brilliant. I got a suggestion to read this book seeing it was on the New York times best sellers. This book has an amazing story line and has all the surprises a reader could hope for.    As for the narration by and ignorant five year old, all I can say is annoying. This boy is completely stupid in some aspects, I kept thinking back to myself when I was that age and I never gave furniture human aspects. Although this boy is smart enough to know what's good and bad, he still drives the reader insane with ignorance. The plot should have stopped after they escaped, yet dragged on and on. I kept reading it only to finish it. I was bored out of my mind once they had escaped. I would not suggest this book to anyone, as it was a complete waste of time.

B00000ITOY|5.0|I will be honest - I bought this on a whim.  I really didn't know how he would like it.  He has found more ways to play with this toy than I could have imagined!  The obvious way to play with this is to take the pieces off the pegs or dump them over and make a lot of fun noise.  He also likes to put them back in various ways - testing different pegs with different pieces, he likes to clack them together, spin them around on the pegs, turn the board upside down and use it as a drum by hitting the various pieces on it, he tries to stack the wooden pieces on the floor and knock them down. He likes it when I stack them like house of cards - on their ends - and make a tall tower.  The pieces are small enough that they are easily  manipulated but not so small that I worry about them.  Very engaging and quite a surprise!
0142406112|5.0|Teenager Alex Rider is recruited by British Intelligence after his uncle, a spy, is murdered. Coerced into completing Uncle Ian's mission, Alex proves his aptitude for the job. With his martial arts training, language skills, and courage, he is more than worthy of the role.<br /><br />Alex is a sympathetic character from the start of his adventures, and the pacing is fast and furious. When I learned a movie had been made based on this story, I ordered the film and promptly bought the next books in this engaging series. This story is a treat for adults as well as kids.

B0001XAS2G|5.0|There seems to be a new resurgence of interest in 1970s music, particularly among today's 15 - 25 year olds. I grew up in the 70s and my friends' teenage sons are regularly asking me for recommendations of lesser known 1970s bands. They all know about Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the like, but they are not familiar with most of the lesser known 1970s bands.<br /><br />To assist others looking for lesser known 1970s music, I'm posting recommendations of 1970s bands and albums that aren't very well known but are worth the attention of a new generation of listeners.<br /><br />Al Stewart is one such artist and his Time Passages, released in 1978, is one such album. Al Stewart had released several albums prior to Times Passages. The album he released prior to Time Passages was Year of the Cat, which became his best selling album, by far.<br /><br />Year of the Cat was an excellent album and Time Passages, while not as commercially successful as its predecessor, was of a similar high quality. There's not a weak track on the entire album.<br /><br />Times Passages doesn't seem to be well known among today's 15-25 years olds, but it was very well known in the years immediately following its release. Back in the late 1970s, everybody I knew had Year of the Cat and most had this album as well. If you're checking out 1970s music, this is an album that should be in your collection.<br /><br />If you buy this album and you like it, then you might want to check out some other Al Stewart albums. If you like this one, then buy Year of the Cat if you don't already own it.<br /><br />If you like those two, you might want to check out Past, Present and Future (released in 1973) and Modern Times (released in 1974). Both are excellent albums, but also seem to be overlooked and largely forgotten today.<br /><br />Al Stewart is still releasing new material. I would also suggest checking out his more recent releases like Beach Full Of Shells and Sparks of Ancient Light.<br /><br />In short, Time Passages is a top quality album that was very popular when it was first released but which seems to be overlooked and largely forgotten today.<br /><br />If you're interested in checking out some excellent 1970s music which seems to be overlooked today but which deserves a new generation of listeners, Al Stewart's Time Passages is an album that's worth your attention.ar when it was first released but which seems to be overlooked and largely forgotten today.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was an incredible story and I'm so glad that Jaycee had the courage to write it.  Unlike another reviewer wrote, I did not find this book difficult to read.  It was so compelling I could barely put it down and read the whole thing in 2 days!  Her style of narrating the past and interjecting her current reflections on what happened is quite genius. This story does touch on the misery that her kidnapper subjected her to but most of the book is about her feelings in captivity and how it affected her thought process.  I cried at the part when she was reunited with her mom.  How wonderful that her mother never gave up hope.  I'm amazed at how far Jaycee has come along as an individual and as a writer in such a short period of time.  Jaycee I hope you will write more books in the future and wish you luck on all of your endeavors!
0553801473|4.0|Martin's latest installment in his epic pulls in the reigns a little bit, taking us out of the hot mess that is Westeros (for the most part), and finally starting to stitch the eastern and western sagas together through use of traveling characters, bonds of alliegance, and revenge...  It becomes clearer and clearer that, though magic is flowing back into the world because of Danarys' children, such power is no simple thing to control, and exacts prices that individual players in this ongoing game of thrones may not be willing to pay.  At least, not by themselves.<br /><br />Though I would call their stories the most compelling of the lot, we hear comparatively little of either Bran or to a lesser extent Arya.  I am not sure if that means there will be more focus on them as intensely magical and pivotal characters in the future, or if they will slowly decay back into dust if and when the Targaryan queen loses one or all of her dragons.  All the focus in 'A Dance With Dragons' seems to be on characters who are striving now, traveling now, working now, on the fringes now, but for all that arguably more important due to their rangings.  Fortunately, that means Cerci Lannister is finally set to cooling her heels.  For those who have said here that one feels more softly towards her at the end, I must whole-heartedly disagree.  She deserved much worse, and more, suffering than the measly pittance meted out.  I have no problems with who she may choose to sleep with in the books, despite personal feelings at odds with incest...  But she is nasty, callous, powerhungry, and more than a little stupid about the way she politics.  Frankly, I'd like to see her thrown in a blender with old weasly lord Frey and made into dragon slurry inch by bloody inch, but Robb Stark died two books ago as meet proof that I don't get what I want here, though I'm quite happy to continue reading, anyway.<br /><br />I think we finally have the beginnings of the rise to peak, though, in a narrative that's already some four thousand pages long and counting, even denoument will likely take a book's worth of pandering...  But in the immediate future, there's this whole sloppy Slaver's Bay war to deal with, and with the flux galloping, much and more could easily change the whole tangent of the saga.  I just can't wait to see the dragons once more on the move, and if HBO gets its' way, we'll see the next novel soon!!!
B005CMSDKA|3.0|This movie is way overrated.  It's a total Bourne Identity rip off even down to the awful shaky cameras and bland colors. Hollywood shows it's typical lack of fresh ideas.  Here's the plot, in a nutshell (Spoilers Ahead).  Hanna is the last of a genetically altered/engineered group of kids that were bred to be super soldiers.  Eric Bana, a former CIA agent, kidnaps her as an infant.  He raises her out in the wilderness and trains her to be the perfect assassin.  Her mission being to kill his former boss Marissa, played adeptly by Cate Blanchette.  She fails and thus begins a massive hunt, by the CIA, for Hanna and Eric Bana.  Sounds okay, but there are a lot of problems with the movie beyond the Blair Witch quality camera work.  First of all, every one of the pursuers of Hanna are totally incompetent. Marissa goes to some weird bar, with a shemale performer, to hire some mercenaries to hunt down Hanna. You get the impression that these are tough experienced assassins that will give Hanna and Erik a run for their money.  Wrong.  What you get are just some average weak goons that seem no better than 3rd rate mob henchmen.  They make Hanna more formidable mainly by making everyone chasing her totally inept.  In one scene, a bunch of CIA agents have Erik totally surrounded.  Instead of just shooting him, they decide to brawl with him one at a time.  He takes them down one by one, until the last guy decides to pull out a gun to try to shoot him, but he's quickly taken down with a throwing knife.  Apparently, only one of them had a gun.  You get a lot of that in the movie.  Another turn off is that everyone in the movie is a bad guy.  You really have no one to root for.  I suppose you could root for Hanna, but she's a remorseless brutal killer.  Also, every character in the movie is weird.  Hanna is naturally bizarre, but every person she \\"befriends\\" or comes across is a scatter brained weirdo.  The worse one is her newfound friend, Sophie, who is talking machine that wont stop.  In fact she has more lines in 10 minutes of screen time than Hanna, Erik and Marissa put together for the entire film.  I kept hoping that Hanna would kill her and spare the audience from further suffering.  Oh, well.  Suffice to say, the movie ends predictably with the \\"showdown\\" between Marissa and Hanna.  Since Marissa is basically a pencil pusher, it's a head scratcher trying to figure out just how she would think she would have a chance against a brilliant super assassin like Hanna.  I guess we're not supposed to ask questions like that.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|Great little mixing console for home use and practice.     I use it at home and sometimes take it on the road for small gigs where I need to connect my guitar, a pair of cordless mics and a portable electronic drum kit.    This thing has phantom power just in case you didn't read that already!    Overall I can say without hesitation that this unit is sturdy and packs all the necessary features you'd need and even has a british EQ to help shape your sound a bit.    Cons? Not many... One gripe about this unit is that it has no power button! I mean what kinda electronic device comes without a power button these days huh? You have to disconnect the power adapter either from the power source or from the back of the mixer in order to take the device off. Apart from that the LED is wayyy too bright, so bright that you can't look at the device for very long and obviously can't make out the writing and control labels on the device. I notice all Behringer pedals come with this bright led. What I usually do is take a piece of tape and cover the led.     I recommend getting this unit and only gave it 4 stars because of the few cons listed above.

B0034G4P8U|2.0|I can't believe Hasbro alowed Micheal  Bay to butcher this franchise on the big screen! Okay the first one was okay, the second one was pure imature garbage, and Dark of the Moon was meh.... I will say though there are some G1 nods, but not enough, for crying out loud they did a horrible job on Soundwave, and Shockwave, and why did they make Bumblebee such a crazy warrior, for goodness sakes in the G1 series he was a Recon Transformer, not a fighter, because he would always get he's butt kicked! And Starscream getting killed by Sam, really Bay? And of course the human are flat out stupid, crude, cartoonie, and just add to stupidity of the trilogy! And Megatron is crap in this, they make him look like a sad lost puppy in ROTF, and DOTM, and Alpha Trion (excuse me SENTINEL PRIME) was never on the Ark! And Alpha Trion was never a Prime! They should rename this trilogy, BayFormers!

0345529057|2.0|I'd heard about this series of books when the HBO series based on them came out, so I decided to give it a read.  Obviously, Martin hasn't completed the series - there is a book 5 in the works, although no word if that is the end - so it's hard to pass judgement on it completely.  I can say that Martin is a very good writer with a true gift for creating memorable characters.  His style is easy and entertaining to read.  The story line is fairly gritty with a lot of graphic descriptions of violence, sex, rape and coarse language.  Most people would say this makes it \\"realistic\\".  I suppose.  I'm kind of neutral on that question, at times it seems a bit gratuitous, but it doesn't really bother me.  I'd don't think I'd give a copy to my 12 year old nephew though.  I also don't mind the skipping around from character to character, in fact, I like it.  I think that's the best way to tell a story when things are happening all over the place.  Tolkien did it masterfully in the Lord of the Rings, and Martin makes excellent use of the technique here.    However, as I read this series, I can't get the image of the old spinning plates act out of my mind.  The one where a someone gets 10 or 15 plates spinning on sticks and miraculously keeps them going, doing more and more outrageous tricks with them.  Every once in a while, a plate will fall off a stick and shatter on the floor, only to be replaced by 2 or 3 more.    Martin's Game of Thrones series is a lot like that.  He gets all these characters up and spinning, bouncing around all over the place, running into all kinds of misadventures.  Every once in awhile, he'll kill one off, only to shift the focus to a new character, or re-emphasize an existing character.    Long pointless fantasies are nothing new - see David Wingrove's Chung Kao series, or even E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith's Lensmen series - and HBO made an outstanding choice leaping on this series to bring it to TV.  It's a fantastic soap opera.  Entertaining as hell.  It's absolutely perfect for a TV series.        But is it a great book with a great story.    Nope.

Their \\"Dark Side\\", displays their more metallic sound, where, according to (Drummer) Mike Portnoy, crunchy guitars and edgy, aggressive double bass drumming are the key ingredients. The songs performed with this sound are the songs that explain the band's influences of bands, like IRON MAIDEN, JUDAS PRIEST, BLACK SABBATH, and METALLICA.    Their \\"Light Side\\", displays their more melodic sound, where, according to (Drummer) Mike Portnoy, catchy, melodic vocals and dynamic songwriting, are heard. The songs performed with this sound are the songs that explain the band's influences and appreciation for JOURNEY, PETER GABRIAL, U2, and PINK FLOYD.    Unfortunately, their 3rd side, \\"The Epic Side\\", was not included. Their \\"Epic Side\\" features their extremely \\"lengthy\\" technical songs, songs that explain their influences and apprection for bands, like GENESIS, PINK FLOYD, YES, and RUSH.     According to (Drummer) Mike Portnoy, Mike decided to focus only on their \\"Light Side\\" and \\"Dark Side\\" for the following two reasons:    1) Mike wanted this compilation to be, to use Mike's description from the album's liner note, \\"...An easily digestible introduction to [our] music to the unitiated\\". This means that some of the songs featured here are in \\"Edited\\" format. 4 more songs featured on this album are remixed. This making it intriguing for the new Dream Theater fan, in which it will give them the inspiration to go out and get the original albums in which these songs originally came.    2) Mike also chose the \\"Edited\\" & \\"Remixed\\" versions of these songs so the already existing Dream Theater fan will have new versions to listen to, as the already existing Dream Theater fan will most definitely have the original versions of these songs.    DISC ONE: THE DARK SIDE    \\"PULL ME UNDER\\" (2007 Remix)    Original version from the album \\"Images And Words\\" (1992). Here it is, fellow Dream Theater fans: Dream Theater's one & only hit. This 2007 Remix is simply amazing.    \\"TAKE THE TIME\\" (2007 Remix)    Original version from the album \\"Images And Words\\" (1992). Another incredible song, in remixed form.    \\"LIE\\" (Edited Version)    Original version from the album \\"Awake\\" (1994). Another one of my all-time favorite Dream Theater songs.    \\"PERUVIAN SKIES\\"    Originally from the album \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" (1997). What a great song.    \\"SCENE SIX\\": HOME (Edited Version)    Original version from the album \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Another favorite of mine.    \\"MISUNDERSTOOD\\" (Edited Version)    Originally from the album \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" (2002). Awesome tune.    \\"SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE\\": IV. The Test That Stumped Them All    Originally from the album \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\". Part 4 of the 42:03 \\"Epic\\". Just simply awesome.    \\"AS I AM\\"    Originally from the album \\"Train Of Thought\\" (2003). Such an awesome hard-rocking song.    \\"ENDLESS SACRIFICE\\"    Originally from the album \\"Train Of Thought\\" (2003). Another amazing song.    \\"THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL\\": VI. READY / VII. REMOVE    Originally from the album \\"Octavarium\\" (2005). Such an amazing song.    \\"SACRIFICED SONS\\"    Originally from the album \\"Octavarium\\" (2005). Awesome.    DISC TWO: THE LIGHT SIDE    \\"ANOTHER DAY\\" (2007 Remix)    Original version from the album \\"Images And Words\\" (1992). Another awesome remix.    \\"TO LIVE FOREVER\\"    Originally from the CD Single \\"Lie\\" (1994). This song, I think, was recorded during the \\"Awake\\" sessions. Though, left off of the album, Dream Theater decided to include this track as the B-Side to the \\"Lie\\" CD single. Awesome song.    \\"LIFTING SHADOWS OFF A DREAM\\"    Originally from the album \\"Awake\\" (1994). Such an awesome song. Can't hear it enough.    \\"A MIND BESIDE ITSELF\\": III. THE SILENT MAN    Originally from the album \\"Awake\\" (1994). Part III of \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\". This is an amazing song.    \\"HOLLOW YEARS\\"    Originally from the album \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" (1997). Another amazing song.    \\"SCENE FIVE\\": THROUGH HER EYES (Alternate Album Mix)    Original version from the album \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Another awesome song. Love hearing Theresa Thomason's harmonies.    \\"SCENE EIGHT\\": THE SPIRIT CARRIES ON    Originally from the album \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\" (1999). Such a beautiful, inspiring, and uplifting song.    \\"SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE\\": VI. SOLITARY SHELL (Edited Version)    Original version from the album \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" (2002). Part 6 of \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\". One of the best songs from Dream Theater's catalogue.    \\"I WALK BESIDE YOU\\"    Originally from the album \\"Octavarium\\" (2005). Amazingly awesome.    \\"THE ANSWER LIES WITHIN\\"    Originally from the album \\"Octavarium\\" (2005). A song that I still consider to be of my all-time, not to mention, personal, favorites.    \\"DISAPPEAR    Originally from the album \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\\" (2002). Awesome.    This compilation is way too awesome to not have in your collection. It is, definitely, the best way to start off your Dream Theater collection, if you are a new Dream Theater fan. If you're an existing Dream Theater fan, then this CD belongs in your collection.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this alarm clock app is very useful. I really like the feature of being able to set requirements for snoozing like having to do math problems and cutting time off each consecutive snooze. I also really like that you can use your own music for the alarm and can set it to use a random song. I use my phone alarm to get up every day and I have to change the alarm sound frequently or it stops waking me up so the random song option is very useful.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|4k transfers instead of 8k???? and no original versions??? 5.1 sound and not 7.1 from Mr. THX himself??? enough said...I'm not buying this crap...
1423389387|4.0|I was reluctant to ask for this to review, since it is 36 CDs long, and over 43 hours.  I mostly listen on my way to work, which is about a 20 minute drive.  43+ hours divide4d by 20 minutes is a looong time.  I thought I would get bored.  I thought I'd lose track of who was who, and what was going on.  I was wrong.  Big time wrong.  I found myself at work wondering what Kvothe was going to do next, was he going to get any better with women, what his next scrape would be.  I very seldom found myself mentally drifting while I was listening.  This says a lot for the writer, and almost as much for the reader, Nick Podehl.  I enjoyed WISE MAN'S FEAR so much that I am planning on ordering the first book, THE NAME OF THE WIND.  Both are available in paperback.  I think I'd rather listen to this story than read it; the paperback has to be an inch and a half thick.  I'd break the binding before I was finished reading.<br /><br />Mr. Podehl does a very good job.  His women are distinct, without being breathy or falsetto.  His accents are diverse; I did think the Adem as a whole sounded like they came from some Scandinavian country.  I enjoyed this far more than I expected to - always a nice surprise.<br /><br />My one complaint is about a production issue.  The tracks on this run between 4 and five minutes.  If I miss a phrase or a word, I hate to listen to 4 minutes of something I just heard in order to get the little thing I missed.  Did it, but didn't like it.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|This is a realy good CD, I have to say I like every song on it a lot but...I see some say best cd since Rythym of the Saints, Graceland, whatever, it in my opinion it isn't...I actually liked Your The One better then some othe others it is compared against but to say it is better than this or that is kind of pointless to me...it is good in its own right...in my opinion the only measure that matters.     The CD seems short to me (just under 40 minutes), or maybe it is long and only seem short in a Paul Simon type riddle...oh never mind...I can't help but feel like there is an extended version to come :-).    I think if I had to pick favorites on the CD it would be Afterlife....fill out the form, wait in the line....somehow I see that happening and So Beautiful or So What for its message...but like I said they are all good, interesting though I picked a couple of the faster tempo songs as my favorites.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Seems that for their 15th album, \\"Systematic Chaos\\", Dream Theater wanted to creat an album darker lyrics and a darker edge, while continuing to display their classic \\"Dream Theater\\" progressive sound & style. They most certainly succeeded with this direction. This album is filled with pure amazement and energy.    \\"IN THE PRESENCE OF ENEMIES\\" - PART I: I. PRELUDE / II. RESURRECTION    What an awesome way to start of this incredible album. Both \\"In The Presence Of Enemies\\" - Part I and \\"In The Presence Of Enemies\\" - Part II (which is the final track on the album) are actually one song, split in half. This track contains the song's first 9:00, while Part II contains the song's last 16:38. When heard in its entirety, the song actually clocks in at 25:38, obviously.     \\"FORSAKEN\\"    This song instantly became one of my all-time favorites from Dream Theater. \\"Why?\\", you ask. I'll tell you: The story involves ... a Vampiress. (Guitarist) John Petrucci has said that the story of \\"Forsaken\\" tells of a man, who receives an unexpected visited from a Vampiress. The man in the story thinks he is being shown the most beautiful things. But, in reality, the Vampiress is actually sucking out his blood.     \\"CONSTANT MOTION\\"    This is such an awesome heavy-as-hell song. Do not skip over this one.    \\"THE DARK ETERNAL NIGHT\\"    Another amazing heavy track.    \\"REPENTANCE\\": VIII. REGRET / IX. RESTITUTION    This track continues Mike Portnoy's 12-Step-Suite. This is another awesome entry.    \\"PROPHETS OF WAR\\"    From what I have read, (Vocalist) James LaBrie had written this song, loosely basing it on \\"The Politics Of Truth\\", a novel written by Joseph C. Wilson. The song talks about the Iraq war and its (possible) ulterior motives that stand behind it. What an amazing song. The chants that heard throughout this song were actually recorded by \\"real\\" Dream Theater fans. Those lucky S.O.B.'s. :)    \\"THE MINISTRY OF LOST SOULS\\"    Written by (Guitarist) John Petrucci, this song tells the story of a person, who, unfortanutely, dies, while in the process of saving a woman from drowning. Turns out that the woman, who is saved, is filled with regret and sorrow, until she is finally reunited with her rescuer. Awesome track.    \\"IN THE PRESENCE OF ENEMIES\\" - PART II: III. HERETIC / IV. THE SLAUGHTER OF THE DAMNED / V. THE RECKONING / VI. SALVATION    Here, would be the last 16:38 of \\"In The Presence Of Enemines\\". As I said, \\"In The Presence Of Enemies\\" - Part I opens this album, with \\"In The Presence Of Enemies\\" - Part II closing the album. This means, as I also stated, that the song is actually split in half.    The story of \\"In The Presence Of Enemies\\" is this:  Dream Theater thought the song sounded perfect to be the album's opener. But they realized that the song was too long to be an opening album track. This is where they also discovered the song was not only sounded great to be an opening track, but it also sounded great to be the closing track. But it was also decided that since \\"Octavarium\\", which clocks in at a full 24:00 already closed out their last studio recorded album, they didn't want to repeat themselves. So, they decided to make this song both, an opening track and a closing track, by splitting it up.    This is another album that proves to us that Dream Theater is not going anywhere. They are going to be with us for a long time. Their journey has been a long one, where they have come a very long way, and they still have a long way to go. What a great album.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This used to be a great app but the Dev decided to go greedy! This is an ad show with a small game attached to it.
B002XTXFU8|4.0|I have watched Bronson several times on several different formats (DVD, Netflix, Blu-ray). All I have to say is that it is a wonderful movie and would recommend watching. However, I found the Blu-ray version VERY grainy and muddled. I also noticed a kind of \\"glitter effect\\" that made it look as if I was seeing the film through a snowglobe filled with gold glitter. The DVD and Netflix copies were FAR superior in picture quality. So, beware of the Blu-ray!
B000002W9Q|3.0|Watched Dirty Dancing for the umpteenth time and had forgotten how good the music was.  Ordered the soundtrack but it doesn't include all of the songs.  Good but could have been better.
B001KNUQ8M|5.0|While shopping the aisles of our local supermarket the other day, I heard the familiar strains of \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" and could barely contain myself.  Look, I'm a 63 year old child of the 60's.  The best times of my life were my single days in Vail, Colorado.  I have the vinyl but haven't played it in years because I no longer own a record player.  I immediately went home and ordered the CD from Amazon and I'm in heaven.  I will admit that I did notice kind of a difference in the sound from the vinyl that I remember in my mind and this re-mix, but it's still great music and I'm glad that I ordered it.  This is absolutely the BEST there is PERIOD.
B0058VW36U|4.0|There is a good reason this app is so high on the top apps list. It&apos;s a fun puzzle game with deceptively simple mechanics with a &quot;collecet them all&quot; aspect for those of us with completionist OCD. The production value is very high with colorful artwork and a &apos;mostly&apos; well designed interface (the level reset button is too close to the menu button for my liking). Controles work well for the most part, with most of the mechanics responding to either a simple tap or swipe of your finger. I started having difficulty with the game interpreting my intentions mid way through the game when more objects were being placed closer together, but most levels are so short that restarting and trying again isn&apos;t that painful. The game ran smoothly on my Droid 2 except when the rope-real was intoduced. whenever i interacted with one i noticed a slight dip in frame rate. this was also the only mechanic that required more than a tap or swipe to use. As I said, the levels are short but the developers more than make up for it with quantity, and promise more to come.\n\nAll told, this game is well worth the $0.99 asking price.
0439023521|5.0|This was one of the best reads I've picked up! There was sooo much suspense and I was gripped until the end. The beginning took off a little funny, and the way Collins writes was a bit weird at first. But then I got used to it and WOW, what a read!    I am definitely going to read the sequel and have high hopes that it will be just as amazing. Also looking forward to the movie now!!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I have been playing this game almost every moment I am awake! Any game that is addicting, you know it&apos;s good!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I have seen this movie twice, once with my children (ages 4, 5, and 8) and once with my husband. He's from CA and loves surfing so I thought he'd enjoy it too. It really is a very good movie. The only scary/questionable part is the shark attack, and even that is not particularly GORY. It's just very emotional (especially for me as a mom, when Bethany's mom sees the ambulance carrying her daughter drive by and breaks down... wow). I thought all  of the actors did a great job (well maybe not so much the guys playing her older brothers, but they were minor characters really). Even if you are not Christian and do not particularly like \\"spiritual\\" movies, that's only one element of the story. The real story is about the girl and how she overcomes this event in her life. And really, it's about surfing. I would say at least 25% of the movie is just gorgeous scenes of Hawaiian surfing. You can't really go wrong with that.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I purchased this watch over a month ago.  After watching some of the online Garmin videos, I found it easy to set up and use the basic features.  Having it track my pace and map each run was great! However, after about 7 uses, it started to lock up and become unresponsive.  I see others have had similar problems with this watch.  I liked the watch, but at this price I would expect more reliable quality.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw this book on the top 10 amazon kindle for a very long time, but every time I read the summary of the book I thought it would be too science fiction for my liking.  Just this past Saturday I made my move to read it and I was captivated from the beginning.  I could have spent all Saturday reading this book, but as a mother of a 4 year old other priorities took precedence.  Either way I finished reading it on Monday - the flow was non stop, and action kept coming.  Even though it is about kids fighting against each to the death   , the story focus on survival.    The main charatcter - she is a thinker and brave, you can't help but like her.    This is going to become one of my highly recommended books to all.  If you have been hesitating read it - I can't wait to read book 2.
1451629184|5.0|I read this book and am amazed how anyone could have survived her ordeal.   If anyone can believe in \\"HOPE\\" It is Jaycee. May god continue to bless her and her   family for all her lost years. Thank you Jaycee for sharing your story, and  giving me a deep meaning of hope and how one must survive through any unwanted situation. I admire you for all your strength and your courage.     I hope your new normals in life are full and complete now with new healthy normals everyday. You are beautiful.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I agree with everyone's reviews. It is a film to warm your heart and rekindle faith in human beings. I loved it. If you do too I'd also recommend a film with Sean Astin called 'Rudy' which is magnificent, another based on a true story (American football themed)film that like 'The Blind Side' actually manages to keep true to the real life story. 5 stars for each? Not enough!
0316174483|5.0|I absolutely LOVE ed emberley books! They are so simple and so fun! My second graders absolutely LOVE all his books, especially picture pie and the thumbprint books! :D :D Goes great for making up their own stories and learning fractions.. it is SO SIMPLE too, LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
B00005OCMR|5.0|What can I say?  I was around way back when for the first viewing in a theater and loved it then.  Had to buy this as husband gift to coincide with the release of the updated version and so was forced to cough up big time.  Gouged by seller, but it was after all, my choice to buy it. Seller didn't force me. My fault for waiting too long so I sucked it up on that one.  Totally worth it in the long run, it was a very welcome gift!
0553801473|5.0|I'm halfway through this volume. All the intrigue continues everthing is still boiling and I cannot guess how it will turn out
1932100660|5.0|I have bought several copies of this book to give away once reading it myself.  I don't have a scientific mind but found this easy to read and understand.  Changed my life forever!
0345529057|5.0|I got what I ordered and everything was just as I was expecting it to be.  100% happy with my order.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|The movie for me was very hard to watch and left me in tears. What upsets me is the immediate outpouring of hurt feelings, people complaining it was antisemitic. The fact is, neither the Romans nor the Jews killed Christ. He willingly gave up His life, to save a lost world. He could have stopped it at any point but was determined to do the will of the Father. If blame is to be placed, it is to be placed squarely on every one of our shoulders. Jesus gave up His life so that we may have eternal life. Every sin great or small made the crucifixion necessary and even if only one person had accepted Christ as their savior, He would have still done it. As for the Jews; they are still God's chosen people and have a great role to play in the end times. I apologize if this was not so much a review as an attempt for people to see what the film was really about. Despite director Mel Gibson's recent behavior, I believe the film, coupled with his behavior points out that we are ALL sinners and in need of the salvation provided on the cross and more importantly by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.
B000VXJYFI|5.0|I thought the color vinyl was a bit gimmicky but it doesn't really sound that bad.  Bit muffled in the top end as was common of live recordings of the era.  Good record, the master is faithful.
B0043RSE2M|4.0|This movie is entertaining.Good story,worth watching!..The 3D is good,not alot of pop out's,but enough to wow you.When Gru enters space in the rocket ship..the 3D stands out the best..worth watching in 3D,better in 3D than 2D..I give the movie 4.5 stars and the 3D 4 stars.<br /><br />SEE ALL MY 3D REVIEWS:THANKS!

0060763280|5.0|I think that this book brings a new perspective to the way people think about money and why they think the way they do. It may not be all your fault as to why you see money the way you do, but it is your fault if you don't want to change, cause this book can show you how!
B00000DR5I|5.0|People often wonder how I can enjoy Tangerine Dream when I dislike the ambient genre as much as I do. Simple- after hearing several Brian Eno albums, this is still better than a good portion of his overrated work (this doesn't include everything he's done from Here Comes the Warm Jets through Before and After Science though, which aren't even ambient albums anyway except for Discreet Music).     Even the Fripp/Eno collaboration doesn't feel like they created pure ambience to me, so those albums get a free pass as well. Albums like Music For Airports however, are totally boring to me.  My impression of that popular 1978 album- the songs never seem to go anywhere and the choice of musical instruments are extremely limited to nothing but repetitive beats, synths and a few piano lines.  Bleh.  Tangerine Dream is better.     Anyway, Rubycon is a fantastic album. There's numerous things taking place at once upong hearing one of the two 17-minute songs included here. It's not just mindless, uninteresting bloops and bleeps. You have mellotrons, synthesizers and organs coming together to create fascinating otherworldly sounds and a highly original, futuristic style. I have to disagree with those that say this stuff sounds badly dated. Not really. Originality is the reason why.     \\"Rubycon Part One\\" is a bit more interesting to me because musically it feels stronger with a sped up rhythm taking up the second half of it, but \\"Rubycon Part Two\\" can hold its own as well. Again, the use of a wide variety of musical instruments is the number one reason I admire Rubycon as much as I do. More specifically, Tangerine Dream seemed to have a very important mindset when making this album- musical instruments and variety first and *then* implement the atmosphere.  It just happened to work to good effect.   I'm shocked but it *does* actually work!
1932100660|5.0|I didn't want to like this book.  Really.  However, you can't argue with the facts.  I started following the plant based diet as an experiment for one month.  It's been 2 years tomorrow!  I've never felt better.
055357342X|5.0|i love the way characters are written by the author. just so vivid and the more we read the missing details are revealed. all i hope is the author stay healthy and bring us the conclusion of this series. and not make us wait too long!  i would love to know if Pod is ok. he is a good boy and i am still waiting on more about littlefingers. and what are the Others really.   can't wait!
B004M66YSA|2.0|If you like this band or this album, then that's good. We've all got our opinions, and I mean no disrespect.<br /><br />That being said, I was thoroughly unimpressed by \\"Belong\\" for a few reasons:<br /><br />1) The singer sounds like Edward Scissorhands (good movie!), which gets irritating after a song or two. My theory is that he's trying to channel MBV's Kevin Shields, but is failing due to the music's timid, poppy sound.<br /><br />2) The music is sweet and poppy and reminds me of The Cure. While I like The Cure, I was really hoping for more of a guitar-oriented album. Some of the songs do have a guitar crunch, but more of them rely on sappy keyboard hooks that I've heard many times before.<br /><br />3) While the lyrics are somewhat obscure (I read them all), my best guess for most of the songs was that they were about drugs and their scene. Speaking as someone who's had little exprerience with counterculture \\"scenes\\", I found it hard to relate to.<br /><br />4) Lyrically, it was that old sentiment of \\"We're young and we're freaks, but I think you're beautiful, so let's go join the other freaks. Now we're doing drugs and it's amazing but oh no! Drugs are bad sometimes! But we're freaks and I still think you're beautiful!\\". In school, I was an outsider to everything, and seeing kids form scenes because they felt like they were \\"the strange ones\\" and coming together through music and drugs made me roll my eyes. Them and their celebration of youth. . .<br /><br />Basically not my cup of tea.
B000003S2K|3.0|I'm afraid, much like I don't get the appeal of ambient music as a whole, I *definitely* don't get the appeal of this popular piece of ambience released in 1978 by Brian Eno.  Does it sound ahead of its time?  Absolutely.  Is the atmosphere intriguing?  Absolutely not, haha.    I love Robert Wyatt- his work with the Soft Machine is simply untouchable, and his solo career wasn't too shabby either.  For him to reduce his talents by appearing on an album where he simply repeats the same set of piano notes over and over for 15 minutes on the first track titled \\"1/1\\" is not only unacceptable, but unbearable to listen to the entire way through.  Both Eno and Wyatt are more talented than this.    In case you're wondering why I'd bother taking the time to review an album I felt very strongly I'd go into not being able to like... Hey, over 100 people have submitted a review for this album here on amazon.   That perked my interest dramatically.  I want to hear what all the fuss is about.  Unfortunately it's about being totally disappointed.    I will say this- even though the piano is extremely repetitive during \\"1/1\\", I do actually like it.  16 minutes requires quite the attention span though- an attention span I admittedly and obviously don't have.  At least it's a pretty melody being beaten into the ground and not something that doesn't even come *close* to resembling a melody (such as what the piano playing in \\"1/2\\" offers, ugh).       Tracks like \\"2/1\\" display a continuous use of female vocals that are neither melodic nor do they work to create an atmosphere, and the less said about the utter nothingness that takes up 10 minutes of \\"2/2\\", the better.    The female vocals in the background sound directly stolen from 10cc's \\"I'm Not In Love\\" and since 10cc is a heck of a lot better than a straight up ambient album by Brian Eno (though I haven't heard much of his 80's discography- if and when I do I might change my feelings concerning this matter) I believe it's a failed experiment on the part of Eno.    Overall, you've been warned.  Music that's not only entirely inappropriate for airports (because those places are noisy and hearing *anything* is difficult) but music that just flat out bores me to tears with its repetition and its obvious lack of Eno's creative ambitions.  It's even more obvious when you listen to an album like Before & After Science released one year earlier.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Will appeal to alienated nerds who will rightly or wrongly identify with the protagonist.  The enthusiasm and sheer number of reviewers of the book is notable.<br /><br />Somewhat troubling ambivalence and rationalization of genocide.

B004A8ZX2S|2.0|That's probably it for Malick and me. 'New World'  already had me sliding in my seat a third of the way in. 'The Tree of Life' had me squirming within forty minutes. I've stuck with him over the journey and regarded his first feature and 'Thin Red Line' with admiration. It seems that his obeisance to Tarkovsky has so overtaken him that he has little to say (though what his cinematic eye expresses in inarguably in the realm of the Sublime). The script aimed at the family drama and subsequent loss of the middle of three sons, is lame to say the least. It gives little room for the actors to move, though the elder pre-teenboy  exerts some screen presence. Little use was made of Sean Penn, as the architect this lad matures into. This brings into question why screen idols were even cast on the project as the leading males never break from their idol status. There's no maturation occuring from the glimpsed family dynamics. Especially absent is the void between the news of the death at the outset and its subsequent effect on the rest of the family.There's half an hour, it seems, of tedious national geographics and a ridiculous spurt of romping dinosaur graphics to evoke Malick's take on creation. Groan. Groan. There's such a disconnect between the sketchy 50s family stuff and the rhapsodic cinema the director gives us in his expression of Evolution which detracts from its lofty ambitions. The pretentious, whispered Big Question voice-overs were simplistic and sentimental. The unashamed Tarkovskian style and direct quoting got up my nose, particularly as they were left as undeveloped effects; the floating mum, her red-headedness, the Job quotation given at the beginning of the film(which smacked of the Russian's well-known fascination with Job); kids looking through rustling, lacey curtains, the over-long study up tree trunks, the dwelling on candles; the list goes on. Really. Michael Haneke has spoken of his own films being a riposte to cinema of this kind.'They are an appeal for a cinema of insistent questions instead of blase answers, for clarifying distance in place of violating closeness, for provocation and dialogue instead of consumption and concensus.' Malick, in all likelihood, would consider his work to fill his European counterpart's ambition. 'The Tree of Life' attests otherwise. A better experience would have fitted into 70 or 80 minutes.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend at the time when he was going to be out of commission for a while after a surgery.  From what I've seen of the series, it's great. Unfortunately, he didn't like it because it wasn't HD, so I wish I could have it back so I could watch it!  At any rate, it makes a great gift for nature buffs, especially if it's still on sale.  I don't know if they even make it in HD, but know that this is Standard Def, so if you are picky about that kind of stuff, then you should buy something else.

B000002LSV|5.0|Well, this is our first ZZTop album, but possibly not the last! Always heard the music on the radio ( a small listening device pre-ipod era, wherein you could listen to many music stations for FREE!!)and in a nostalgic mood decided to order this to see if ZZ were still fun to listen to. Yes, they are and this is a wonderful taste of their music. Crank it up and enjoy, especially since this is such great \\"driving\\" music, the kind you played as loud as possible while out cruising Southern California in your car (again, pre over-crowded freeway days). I know, this dates us as oldsters, but who cares? Music will always be part of our life and this really gets ya' movin'.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I have been a fan since I was 13. I am 43 now.  Stevie is 63!  She voice sounds spectacular.    I realize she could have released ANYTHING...even old demo tracks, and it would have sold.      I appreciate the time and energy she put into this album. YES, I called it an Album! :)    For my money, 'Secret Love', 'For What It's Worth', 'New Orleans', and 'Annabel Lee.' are the standouts.    The rest are each beautiful and more \\"icing on the cake\\" for me!     Thank you Stevie Nicks. Your music continues to fill the soundtrack of my life. I love your work very much.
0785134352|3.0|I saw the film adaptation before I read the graphic novel, which maybe why I'm biased toward the film. I loved the movie and thought it was the best I had seen in a long time. I was less impressed with the graphic novel. What I loved about the film was the dark, sometimes quirky humor; the insane, but fun action sequences; the heartfelt, sometimes tragic story; and the complexity of the characters. Little or none of these things are in the novel. It is darker than the movie, which is to be expected, but since almost all the comedy is in the beginning, the later part of the story is very bleak. The fight scenes are grisly slaughters that are too gruesome to be cathartic. The pacing and plot transitions make the story confusing at times. For instance, Dave appears to be sick in bed, then on the next page he is suddenly in his Kick-Ass costume. A page or two later he mentions in passing that it is a wet-suit he bought on e-bay. The characters are far less likable than in the film. Big Daddy and Hit girl have a completely different backstory, and Dave and Katie's relationship is far less happy. Despite what Dave does as Kick-Ass, he is still as much of a loser at the end as he was at the beginning. You feel like he accomplished nothing at the end. I suppose, though, that this was the author's point. Dave and other superhero wannabes were trying to make life more exciting, but didn't have a real superhero vision.    Unfortunately, I cannot evaluate this book on its own merits. I was and still am a huge fan of the film, and that taints my judgment. If, like me, you are a fan of the movie, you will probably not enjoy the source novel as much, if at all.

1451629184|2.0|I feel for Jaycee. I was excited to read this book, how could a child who lived in hiding as a captor survive? Unfortunately, I feel the book lacked focus. It was a HUGE undertaking that she wrote the book herself, but she really could have benefitted from a professional writer to help her get the most out of her experience for her readers.   The answers that the readers would ask were not touched upon. SHe had 18 years there, and the things that she chose to share didn't give much explaination of Phillip or Nancy. I find it hard to believe that she never 'spoke' to either of them and learned more about how they interacted. Also, her children weren't mentined very often. She was never concerned that Phillip was abusing them? SHe seemed to believe he would not hurt them, but he stopped having sex with her as she grew older and would look for young girls on tv in shorts to turn him on?   She seemed to talk more about the cats than her own children.    I am sorry it couldn't have been written with more focus.  I hope Jaycee and her children live a happy life. Phillip and Nancy deserve to burn in hell.

B003BQ78NW|5.0|This is a great product offered by Bushnell. For the serious golfer who wants to know specific distances to the pin, hazards, front/back of the green, etc this is a must. It is accurate to +/- 1 yard and it consistently gives the same yardage from the same location. I took my unit out on the course and lowered my scores significantly because I had a better idea of what club to use based on the yardage. Also, the pinseeker technology is great because it will give you the yardage of the closest object you are trying to get distances from. One of the other great features is that you can use this to see how far you are hitting your clubs. Simply stand next to your ball and aim back to the tee and you know who far your drive was. Want to clear the false front of the green? You can shoot the distance to the top of the ridge and know exactly how far you need to carry. Plus, with having the standard edition (no slope feature) the unit is legal for tournament use and for adding scores for your official USGA handicap! No more putting the ball well short or too far over the green now. It sped up my playing time and took strokes off my scores. This is a great item and I would recommend it to anyone serious about the game. One of the other great features, you can use it for purposes other than golf (ex: hunting).

B003O86FMW|5.0|How can you take two main characters and put them through similar traumas and not let it get dull? I have no idea, but apparently Ms. Collins is the one to ask?<br /><br />Catching Fire continues the Hunger Games saga in new, breathtaking and riot-inducing ways. The characters get more complex and intertwined as we're introduced to new elements in this twisty and elaborately-woven story of power-greedy big brother and the inextinguishable spirit of humankind.<br /><br />Wow - I can't wait to read the next one.
B004OCCFFI|5.0|\\"It's true - the man has such a voice...\\" - which applies not only to Jonas Kaufmann's haunting depiction of Florestan but to the vocal quality of the tenor himself. His characterisation of Florestan is deeply moving on a scale to match that of Jon Vickers' famous assumption, but not even Vickers could have managed the astounding messa di voce on the G of \\"Gott\\", the first note Florestan is given to sing as Act 2 opens in the dungeon. This marks an artistic and technical advance on the version on Kaufmann's recital album where, impressive though that is, he simply starts mezza voce and swells the note; this live performance of Florestan's aria is the kind of thing which will be anthologised in twenty years when a disc is issued commemorating great singers of the early 21C.<br /><br />However, Kaufmann is not the only glory of this set; Abbado's conducting is of the highest order: exceptionally sensitive, shaped and nuanced, drawing meltingly lovely playing from a combination of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra and the Lucerne Festival Orchestra. Just listen to the soft playing of the horns accompanying Nina Stemme in \\"Komm, Hoffnung\\". Indeed there is a chamber-music-like intensity and detail in Abbado's direction; everything he does makes you listen afresh to the humanity of this opera yet he in no sense emulates the kind of majestic grandeur of Klemperer's classic recording. The Prisoners' Chorus, for example, is sung by a smaller onstage chorus than is normal and I miss the swelling exaltation of their hymn to the sunlight which Klemperer creates, but instead we get a very touching, intimate sense of their suffering. I wish, however, that the truncated dialogue in the edition used here included some of my favorite moments such as Jaquino's announcement that \\"Der Herr Minister\\" Don Fernando has arrived and Rocco's response to it: \\"Wir kommen - ja, wir kommen augenblichlich!\\" and the heart-rending exchange between Florestan and Leonore exchange, \\"O mein Leonore, was hast du f&uuml;r mich getan?\\" - \\"Nichts, nichts, mein Florestan\\", before \\"O namenlose Freude!\\" The orchestra are sparing with but not afraid of vibrato, which is judiciously applied to lend Romantic ardour as and when required.<br /><br />The other aspect of this live recording - the sound, by the way, is exceptionally full and clear, very well balanced and mercifully free of extraneous noise - which gave me most pleasure is Christof Fischesser's Rocco. He can be a blustering, blundering old boor/bore but the singer here, of whom I confess never to have heard but admire greatly on the evidence of this performance, makes him a warm, likeable pragmatist with a heart. He has a voice not of the rotund Gottlob Frick type but one in the lighter basso cantante tradition of Ridderbusch and Moll - an exceptionally clean, focused sound with an appealing edge. The other real, but brief, pleasure is to be found in Peter Mattei's Don Fernando, his beautiful baritone here sounding very similar to that of Simon Keenlyside - which I mean as high praise, especially as I recently heard the latter recently live at the Royal Opera House as a most impressive Macbeth and realised how much bigger his voice has become of late. The two lovers are very capable singers, especially Rachel Harnisch as a charming but not pert or shrill Marzelline.<br /><br />About Stemme's Leonore and Struckmann's Pizarro I have some reservations, mainly on account of the excessive vibrato both allow to creep into their voices in the middle range, yet she is as committed and intense a Leonore as we have heard since Nilsson and Ludwig, with a big, soaring voice and very clear, dramatic enunciation of the text. I could do with a bit more abandon in \\"Abscheulicher\\" but she has all the notes up to a ringing top B. Struckmann characterises very well; he is a strikingly unpleasant and audibly psychotic Pizarro, whereas some singers, such as Tom Krause, as much as I love his voice, make him sound too noble. Dramatically,he is as convincing as Walter Berry for Klemperer, but Berry is a better, more flexible singer. But Kaufmann is simply a marvel.<br /><br />This is another way to perform this elusive opera and the most successful since Klemperer's celebrated recording, which remains very different: more \\"old school\\" symphonic but equally uplifting, spritually; the Abbado is perhaps, though, more moving for being on a more human scale. It was obviously a great experience live and is equally rewarding on CD for repeated listening, owing to the sound quality and lack of stage noise.he is as convincing as Walter Berry for Klemperer, but Berry is a better, more flexible singer.

076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was touching. You could tell the author had the most major transformation of his life up until that point. As he was able to peel off layers of his ego and pride that he lived in by spending time with his mentor and witnessing the humility that he went through while dying. This book makes you look at living and especially dying differently as it opposes the fact that even those who are non-functional physically can still contribute the most important things to people and society as a whole.

0061784788|4.0|This was a book that I won from Goodreads as a First Reads.  It's the first Sigma Force I have read and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.<br /><br />Rollins has many plots going on at once, all related but the action moves from Utah, to Yellowstone Park, to Kentucky, to Iceland, to D.C.  He combines elements of history, science, Mormonism, Native American culture, espionage, and a secret society in this book.  At the end of the book Rollins lists those things that are non-fictional which helps the reader.  The science of Nanotechnology is one that is currently being studied and applied in scientific circles.  Interesting to learn that the death of Lewis Merriweather was NOT a suicide, as originally believed but a murder.  The most fascinating fact to me was the concept of a super volcano lying under Yellowstone National Park which truly could destroy human life.  While in the middle of reading the book I found a reputable science television show online and which explained what could happen with the eruption of this Volcano.  Rollins situations are all believable although the ability of the \\"good guys\\" to get away is what one would expect in this type of fiction.  Mystery, suspense, history, science, commitment to a cause and to one's values all are explored in this hard to put down novel.<br />Rollins also apparently did some research into the teachings of the Book of Mormon and incorporated those beliefs into the action of his book.  Looking forward to reading more Sigma Force novels.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!  Jamie McGuire is a brilliant storyteller that really knows how to keep the reader turning the pages.  From the first page this book is an emotional rollercoaster.  I loved the characters.  Shep and America were great partners in crime to Travis and Abby. And Travis...totally loved him!  I felt like some of Abby's reasoning for not being with him at times was irrational but I still loved her character, and all ends very well for these characters.  Some people might not like endings that are wrapped up in a nice happy package but I do and I think Jamie wrapped up her story perfectly.

We are working on becoming plant-based. I have for the most part, the guy, well he's working on it. The best thing so far is seeing the scale drop. We only have a few pounds to lose each, but it's dropping without us even trying.  We have discovered new foods that we never would have tried before.  I've also noticed that 2:00p.m. tired wall that I used to hit no longer happens. I feel more alive, energetic, and even our love life is better!  This is a MUST for everyone.  It does amaze me how many people get offended when you tell them that meat is bad for them, but I will keep preaching!!!

B001AQO446|5.0|I saw it in the theater over 30 years ago. I bought the VHS.  I bought the DVD. Finally the Blu-ray version of the Blues Brothers arrived the other day and I watched the theatrical version of my favorite movie last night on my ten-foot screen with audiophile sound.  There is no comparison between the Blu-ray and the previous versions.  With the large screen, the deficiencies of the DVD are really apparent. The The Blu-ray picture is so crisp and colorful that one can readily see where the camera was originally slightly out of focus.     There has been lively discussion in these reviews regarding the sound quality, some people being disappointed that the DTS soundtrack is compressed or \\"lossy\\".  Played through an OPPO BDP-93 on my 7.1 system, the sound was excellent--about as good as one can expect from a 30 year old movie.  I can vouch for the fact that it is true stereo and possibly a 4-track original.  The surround effect of Carrie Fisher shooting at the escaping car right after the tunnel sequence was spectacular. I've found that the difference in quality between \\"lossy\\" and lossless formats is negligable if the sampling rate is reasonably high, especially for non-classical source materials. To my ears, the difference can be most readily heard in complex high-frequency passages involving violins or cymbals, especially on digital radio or satellite radio where low sampling rates prevail.    I haven't had time to view the extended version or any of the other information on the disk, so I can't comment beyond the theatrical version.  I don't see how any subsequent version could be significantly improved, either visually or sonically.  I highly recommend the Blu-ray Blues Brothers!

B0055IU4GM|5.0|\\"Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns\\" is John Hiatt's 20th solo album and one of his best! As always, he combines excellent song writing/story telling and amazing vocals with the unique ability to connect with people of all ages and backgrounds by virtue of his music and lyrics. The album has an incredible collection of musicians which include Kenneth Blevins on drums and percussion, Doug Lancio on electric guitars, mandolin and Hammertone and Patrick O'Hearn on bass guitar. \\"Damn This Town\\" gets things started and is classic Hiatt: A rough-edged story with beautiful musicianship filled with raw emotion. \\"Don't Wanna Leave You Now\\" shows Hiatt's softer and tender side as he croons on about love. \\"Detroit Made\\" is about the Deuce and a Quarter car made by Buick. Hiatt is one of the rare vocalists who can pull off singing a song about a car! He closes off the album with \\"When New York Had Her Heart Broke,\\" a touching and dignified recollection of the tragedy of 9/11. If you're a fan of his earlier works, or if you simply want to try something new, you can't go wrong here. Highly recommended!!

B000VBIGD6|5.0|Does this movie even need a review?  It's Chevy Chase at his best as an uptight yuppie trying to carve out the best Christmas he can for his family.  What lies in the way, though, is the family.  Both sets of in-laws descend upon the house to the delight of no one.  Followed by lovely, lovely old Aunt Bethany with her dementia shows up with a live Christmas present.  And! no holiday would be complete without that deadbeat relative that shows up for the free food.  Cousin Eddy adds to the hilarity that is probably one of the worst family gatherings of all time.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, crawl out from under your rock and do so!

0553386794|5.0|I know this review is going to get lost in a sea of voices, so I'll keep it short.<br /><br />I'm not much of a fantasy reader.  I mostly have found the characters too hard to distinguish, too many names, and the land too far removed from what I know to make it believable.  Not so with this book.  Mr. Martin does a fantastic job of making this world similar enough to ours that it's easy to jump into, yet there are enough changes to make it totally separate (religions, magic, weather, etc).  I find the characters easy to follow, and the families easy to tell apart.  And if you're still having trouble telling who is who, there's an index in the back that breaks down the different houses.  The plot twists are very intriguing and will keep you begging for more.  I read this book very quickly and I'm moving through the second at the speed of sound.  This is a great piece of fiction that everyone should read.

B0058YPG1G|3.0|The first 3 episodes have been shown on AMC. To this point in time, the episodes have lost a sense of power to draw me in.

B004ZQRJFO|5.0|When I heard this was coming out, I knew I wanted it. Whether it flopped or not. I remember when the Slim Shady LP came out. I remember hearing \\"see you in Hell for the sequel\\" and thinking \\"these two need to do more of this\\".  This album is just awesome. Brought me back to the days when I was younger. As I listened to it, I felt like a kid again who had just brought home some \\"dirty\\" music, just as I had done before. If you grew up in the 90's and remember blaring Em's, Kid Rock's, Limp Bizkit's, Korn's, and others like it on your parent's stereos, then this album will take you back in time. I only wish I could have bought this at the record store that I always remember going to as an \\"under age\\" kid. The teenagers working there never had to check ID's if the boss wasn't around. Too bad its not there anymore. Great, now I feel old.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I have talked to a number of Star Trek fans who do not think highly of Deep Space Nine. I am not one of them and watching all of season one reaffirms that. I really enjoyed watching these dvds. It has a good story line and a good cast of characters. I did not know that Chief O'Brian was in the early series. Also I got to see the spunk that Major Kira has. I loved how she speaks her mind. Also I had no problems with the discs. They played like they were suppose to. Also I was please that it didn't take long to get the items. I used the fee free shipping and it took only days to arrive at my residence. I look forward to getting all seven seasons of this series. Good job and thanks.

It advertises 11 programmable buttons, but the software only lets you reprogram 9 of them, and 3 of those are left, right, and middle click. You therefore end up with 6-7 programmable buttons. I'm getting a Microsoft SideWinder X8 for more money--at least I know that Intellipoint is well-written (I came from a $9 Comfort Optical Mouse 3000).
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Excellent courtroom thriller with a gritty Los Angeles setting.  The movie was based on Michael Connelly's novel of the same name.  Several plot elements were different from the book most notably two major ones but overall it was true to the book.  The film makers can be forgiven for the changes in my opinion because so any of us love Connelly's books and devour them as soon as they come out.  They had to throw in some surprises for us readers.<br /><br />I'm not a Matthew McConaughey fan maybe because I've seen him in too many vapid romance comedies with Goldie Hawn's mini me Kate Hudson and other actresses.  I also love Marisa Tomei but thought she seemed too old to play Mick Haller's ex-wife.  I take it all back.  McConaughey and Tomei were perfect as were the cast of older character actors who almost stole many scenes.  In William Macy's case he DID steal the scene(s).  Country singer Trace Adkins is a delight as the bad boy leader of the local Hell's Angel group.<br /><br />I was so disappointed with the mangling of Connelly's \\"Bloodwork\\" that I almost gave Lincoln Lawyer a pass.  Don't.

1936719118|5.0|This book so inspired me!  At a time in my life when I needed it most.  Halfway through the book I contacted an art gallery and started pitching a friend of mine's work! The gallery seems interested.  I took a class in pottery wheel throwing, and I'm trying to market my own work in new ways. This is a self-help, do-it-your-self manual that shows how to make money without being greedy. He is an inspiration in a capitalist society, with a heart of gold. I Highly recommend this book!

B0055D3EOG|2.0|Insidious starts off great. It begins with great camera work and a real eerie style. It's actually really good. That is until the second half of the movie occurs and we start figuring things out. It then becomes less scary and more laughable. It changes from a horror movie to a sci-fi/fantasy movie that is completely inappropriate. If you really want to get a full review of this movie go to: [...]

0553801473|1.0|I consider myself \\"ripped off\\" after receiving this book. I should NOT have pre ordered...will not make this mistake again. This book seems to be edited out material that was thrown together to take advantage of the huge interest generated by the HBO series. I doubt the author ever meant to finish this series but saw the huge paycheck that he would get if he churned out another book. Last book I will buy from this author and last book I will ever preorder.

1439183392|5.0|Private investigator Boone Daniels prefers surfing at San Diego's Pacific Beach than working a case.  So he wonders how come he has two investigations in the middle of August as he learns a friend in need is a pest.<br /><br />His board riding buddy Dan Nichols fears his beautiful wife Donna the eleven (on a scale of ten) is having an affair.  Dan wants Boone to conduct surveillance on his spouse.  His new maybe girlfriend lawyer Petra Hall wants to hire him as the investigator on her defense of accused killer teenage Corey Blasingame, son of a wealthy La Jolla realtor.  Her client confessed to killing surfing legend Kelly \\"Uncle K\\" Kuhio and admits ties to the neo-Nazi Rockpile Crew of gangster surfers.  His two cases converge even as the drug cartel threatens to push the surfers from the ocean.<br /><br />Don Winslow's latest Daniel's private investigative thriller is a terrific not very mellow tale that focuses on several interlocking avaricious subcultures competing for the beach.  The story line is fast-paced and loaded with plenty of violent action.  Using the vernacular of the surfing culture to anchor the locale, readers will enjoy the Dawn Patrol giving way to The Gentleman's Hour even when the Pacific behaves like a Kansas.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

1439152780|4.0|Reading the other reviews of this book, a rather startling conclusion came to me:  I seem to be the only person of the male gender at least to have reviewed this book. How very strange!  I don't think I've run across this phenomenon in all my years of reviewing.  Surely there are males out there who love Jane Eyre as much as I do?  I sincerely don't know.  But the reason I ask the question is that I would venture to surmise that if you loved or even liked Jane Eyre, you will love this book.<br /><br />It's also curious that the women who didn't like this book disliked it for all the reasons I liked it.  The book is dense, the characters intensely literary, the writing full of lovely atmospherics.  So much so that I will also venture to add that anyone who is on a familiar footing with the literary life, for whom the literary life, as Proust puts it, is the only life, will love at least the first part of the book.  Almost every single major character in the book, including the males, is obsessed by books and literature. The first third of the book was truly spellbinding for me, whilst the rest of the book, the unravelling of the many mysteries surrounding Milderhurst Castle and the three weird sisters who inhabit it, becomes rather pat. (N.B.--\\"The the weird sisters\\" here is a whimsical reference to Shakespeare's Macbeth.  I don't usually feel I have to explain my allusions, but some of the reviews here have put me on notice.)<br /><br />Here is what it seems to me that Ms. Morton was striving to write or conjure in the first part of the book: Mystery, yes, but not the type of mystery that ever gets unwound or explained, the mystery of time and human personality as it flickers through life. She tries herein to combine that deeper mystery with her vintage standard mystery novel, and the result is unfortunately but inevitably rather strained.  There are several passages, as well as the title of the book itself, which capture this deeper mystery quite well.  My personal favourite is when our intrepid heroine is looking through old black-and-white photographs:  \\"There's something deeply nostalgic about black-and-white photographs, the absence of colour a visual rendering of the deepening funnel of time.\\" As another reviewer has put it: \\"Wow!\\"<br /><br />The plot, as such, has been rehashed by the other reviewers, but plot is not what entranced me about this novel.  It's the deeper mysteries of the human soul caught in time that truly captivate, the oddness of time itself, the literary person as outcast, who has his/her own Milderhurst Castle within her/him, with its walls, from which there is ultimately no escape, constantly haunting the soul with half-remembered voices within them, with Keats's unheard music, with imaginings of unsounded depths.en our intrepid heroine is looking through old black-and-white photographs:  \\"There's something deeply nostalgic about black-and-white photographs, the absence of colour a visual rendering of the deepening funnel of time.\\" As another reviewer has put it: \\"Wow!\\"    The plot, as such, has been rehashed by the other reviewers, but plot is not what entranced me about this novel.

0553593544|5.0|If there is ever a novel worth labelling thriller, this is it. A real page turner from the word go - from first page to last and everything in between. This is the second Ludlum novel I have read, first being The Matarese Countdown which was quite average. This so much more infinitely better, well researched, well plotted, planned, characterised, thought out and with a fastpaced action packed narrative. If anyone thinks NYT bestsellers are not literature then they have never come across such masterpiece storytelling and probably live in a remote cave with their loathsome copies of Shakespeare or John Updike.    The Bourne Identity is a gripping tale of a man, his origins, his uncertain present and conspiracies that entangle a range of ruthless or unsuspecting people somehow associated with the man they dont really know. The movie version is set in a modern setting and far different from this novel but both are definitely greatly enjoyable taken individually. The book set quite a few decades ago (when it was written) deals with the enigma known globally as Carlos the jackal. Bourne and Carlos drive this story with each proving their worth without which they could be dead. A race against time across varying locations in differing situations that make you glued to the book you hold closer and closer as plans unfold, dead bodies discovered, news and its targets manipulated and an ever changing landscape for the protagonist with an unknown past and bleak future.    The beginning is the end and the end is the beginning. There is a covert mission for Jason Bourne but unexpected circumstances have made him lose his memory. His mind throws glimpses of images, some words stand out and he has not lost his ability for being a highly talented operative. The man is plagued by these things, not knowing where it comes from and what it means. Only one thing is clear - there are people out to get him, kill him and he needs to solve the puzzle that is his mind. To uncover where he comes from and why he has talents that are so unusual.     The novel is an exploration of not just the man's mind but the unexpected possibilities of covert missions, deception and the dangerous world of terrorism. This book does work as a standalone but of course Ludlum wrote 2 more of Bourne adventures. The thrill of the first ignites a passion to read on. Pick this up and forget the movie version for the time being. Both are great in their uniqueness. There are no cell phones or other gadgetry in this old novel but the novel isn't dated. If anything it proves how effective a trained person can be when dealt with uncertain and life-threatening circumstances. A real masterpiece from Ludlum.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno Mars created a really nice album and sold at a very reasonable price on Amazon.  Check out his videos and songs on YouTube.  The songs on this very first album demonstrates the talent of this great new artist.  He is soulful at times, pop at another time, and occastionally, he sounds like Michael Jackson--able to hit very nice notes.  His voice is soothing at times, rough at others, and easy to listen to all the time.  Excellent lyrics with \\"Grenade,\\" \\"Just the Way You Are,\\" \\"The Lazy Song,\\" \\"Talking to the Moon,\\" and \\"Liquor Store Blues.\\"  Some of these songs haven't hit the radios, but I'm sure they will soon because he did a great job.
B0036T32LQ|5.0|It is very rare for a horror movie or any movie for that matter to come out and completely surprise you.  This one does it on all fronts.<br />The people who gave this bad reviews just do not understand the movie or were expecting something else.  Really do not want to give anything away because it is so important to go into this unknowing other than the brief description offerred.<br />I have my own interpetation of the movie and would be glad to discuss in the comments section for this review.<br />Have already watched this twice and will watch again.  One of the stars in this movie signed on for a key role in The Hunger Games movies.

Sean Patrick Flanery plays the title role of Power with touching sensitivity. I do not know HOW I missed seeing this movie for over 15 years. I remember there was some controversy surrounding this movie during its initial release. I am so glad I finally got around to seeing this gem of a film.

1451629184|5.0|This is the story of an amazing young girl whose love for her mother provided the strength to endure unbelievable circumstances.    This is not always a happy story. There are details in here that might disturb many people, so buyers beware. I would not recommend this book for children.    Some of my favorite parts were Jaycee's journal from captivity and her in depth discussion of animal therapy after being reunited with her family. The methods were not only interesting from a psychological standpoint, they also provided insight into personality characteristics and behavior patterns in my own life (whether mine or people I know). Excellent read. Absolutely inspiring. Jaycee is a model for all of us when we succumb to the \\"perils\\" (it's hard to think of anything in my life as peril after considering what she went through) of our lives. Uplifting.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|A truly great series, my ONLY complaint is the back and forth shooting being very difficult to follow.If only there was a better way to portray such action for viewers. Also, difficult to tell who's being shot as everyone seems the same, being a 50+ viewer, it is difficult to follow such scenes. Very enjoyable otherwise and would highly recommend. Didn't even hear of Basilone before watching this series. +++
0553278398|5.0|Of the Foundation books I've read, this one is my favorite. It is the beginning. It introduces Hari Seldon. I think it is the most entertaining, and I truly enjoy the characters of Hari and Dors. The other novels are about what happens much later, although Hari is still a huge over-riding part of the story. I recommend this book, and even if you don't continue on reading in the series, this will still be an enjoyable read.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My six year old son is obsessed with this game. He first started playing on my husband's Droid. I ordered this as a birthday present (it's in November) but ended up giving it to him early. Shipping was fast - received within 3 days of ordering. I got it today and immediately gave it to him and his younger (5 yr old) sister to play with. Set up was easy - within a few minutes - and they have been playing with it ever since. This one is a keeper!
B0043GXYBO|4.0|Definitely a book aimed at teens and the like, but I still really enjoyed the story -- I'll be getting the next in the series for sure. I really enjoy vampire stories, and a nice quick read was very pleasant. This is an interesting twist on Vampirism too -- that it isn't necessarily by a bite, but that you are Marked and therefore chosen to become a Vampire. Interesting!
B0034G4ORC|1.0|If an alien arrived on this planet, ate every bad action and sci fi movie ever made, and crapped out a turd, it might resemble something like this movie.    I guess I should have know what I was in for, but after reading several reviews saying this movie was better than District 9 (which was smart and inventive), I went for it. Mistake. Short story, this movie is big, loud, and dumber than a post. This was by far one of the most trite, contrived, melodramatic, uncreative alien movies I've ever seen. It was almost bad enough to make it into the same category as Starship Troopers, but just took itself waaayy too seriously to fully commit to being a parody. As others have said, it plays out like a video game and I frequently found myself saying \\"Here comes the end boss\\", or \\"Level 3, Objective: secure the police station and rescue the civilians\\". In a game it works, in a movie, it sucks. All of the creature movie cliches are here including many versions of the \\"is it really dead?\\" scene. Heaped on top of that is every military buddy movie stereotype we've seen a thousand times, done here do poorly that I really just wanted everyone to die just so the movie would end. Oh and it's long, dragging on...and on....and onnn....is it really dead yet?...NOPE!    I love sci-fi and it's too bad that Hollywood has to screw it up so thoroughly so often. If you want to watch a movie in this genre you're much better off with  Aliens, District 9, Pitch Black, Cloverfield or hey, even Starship Troopers which was as least smart enough to laugh at itself.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|Hello, guys. I'm Leonardo and I live here in Rio. As a musician, I was first seduced by the marvelous soundtrack this movie has - although there are some differences in Brazilian edition, making me a little bit disappointed -, making me eager to buy the Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital Copy version. Yes, this movie is entertaining, even more with Brazilian voices, dubbing the movie making it funnier than its original dialog.<br />There are some things appearing in the movie that doesn't really belong to Rio de Janeiro: First it's impossible to have a clandestine airport here. There ain't no enough space for this. If Carlos Saldanha showed about other regions of Brazil, I'd agree, specially inside Amazon and Midwest region, that makes frontiers with other south American countries.<br />Second, a blue macaw is not natural of this region. We don't have toucans in Rio, either. Yes, you can keep the canaries, but whatthahell is a cockatoo doing in Brazil? It's NOT a bird from here.<br />Third, yes, we have Tijuca forest here, but it is an urban forest where anyone can visit and it's hard to find a snake, for instance.<br />Fourth: Yes, we do have marmosets circulating, but only in Tijuca forest or Urca. When I studied in the university I saw marmosets every time through the window, walking in the electric wires from the lampposts. But HERE IT IS NOT INDIA. They are NOT trained to rob anything from humans, as baboons do there.<br />Fifth: If someone thought you can enter a slum (favela) wihtout permission, you're totally wrong, except those who were pacified by police recently. The drug dealers - traffickers - still dominate some hills here (You can come to the World Cup or Olympic Games, though, because these areas are clean!).<br />And finally, whatthahell is that bikini model appeared in the movie? I know it was a request from the producers - the money people - but, let's be honest, American bikinis look like diapers (!) It's funny how in American culture everybody show their booties for fun - when it doesn't appear something worse - and then when a Brazilian bikini is shown it is labeled indecent? I really do not understand... What a scandal, for God's sake!...<br />Now, talking about positive points of the movie: I think Carlos Saldanha created a high positive image of Rio, even more here really it's high positive place to come, not only for the natural beauties but also for its people and the place itself. The movie has some funnier moments and I think the soundtrack brought the ideal energy this place brings, a mix of samba and techno beat music - or do you think we only dance samba around here? At night Rio people - cariocas - love to go to the clubs to shake to electronic beats.<br />To finish, if you did not see this motion pic, then take a peakaboo. In the end it's worth it.<br />Ah, I was almost forgetting one thing: The part of Carnival parade is gorgeous, and the birds dancing samba is great.doesn't appear something worse - and then when a Brazilian bikini is shown it is labeled indecent?

B004GUSG4M|3.0|I was ready and willing to give this book 5 stars until I reached towards the end at about 90%. The writer did such a good job building the suspense that I had a hard time putting it down.<br /><br />I can't give away any spoilers, but the ending had me with more questions than answers and its not the kind of questions one would think reading this book. These questions could have been simply answered. Really. I'm not upset about the main character but about the other things that happened towards the end. I simply can't enthusiastically endorse this book. It's a good book but why oh why did it have to end that way? I have so many questions.<br /><br />There is a movie in development. I hope they can answer those annoying questions for me when they get to filming it.

B004UUKDNA|2.0|I'll just keep this simple and to the point. Yes, Pumped Up Kicks is catchy and a hit. But both in that song, and all the others on this album, the main singer, Foster, does nothing but do this whiny little voice thing while \\"singing\\". The music in itself isn't anything special either, for hundreds of other indie bands are doing the same kind of things, but better. Listen to the Big Pink's \\"Dominos\\" or Elf Power's \\"Never Believe\\" both songs are indie, poppy, and something one can groove to. But both are just much better in the end. Hopefully someone won't kick Foster in the balls before he has to record vocals for the next album.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I did not find her writting about her cats too long or boring at all.  Instead it made me cry.  She wrote that her only wish at that time was to be able to have conversation with her cat, by handwritten letters of 13 year old child  (written in 1993).  I wish her the very best of everything for the rest of her life.    I have just finished reading.  It is such a shocking, heart-moving, inspiring book , altogether in one book.  I learned nothing is unbearable in my small life compared to what this little girl endured....I find myself thinking of Jaycee and her extraordinary patience to survive whenever having a hard time at work or depressing thoughts of my own.  She is so talented, I think she has something most of us don't.    Jaycee, thank you so much for sharing your story.  Initially I thought I would support you by buying the book,  but it is me, not you,  who are supported here....

0756404738|3.0|First, I listened to this as an MP3 and I think Nick Podehl's narration is outstanding.    The same cannot be said, alas, for Rothfuss' \\"second day\\" of the already monolithic \\"Kingkiller Chronicles.\\"    Note: Patrick Rothfuss is a real writer, better than I could ever hope to be. So I write as a reader.    Everybody talks about the problems of a second book in a trilogy: you're past the introduction of plot lines and lead characters, need to move them on, but inevitably, the end is not satisfying (since it's not really the end).     Rothfuss took many more years than some fans wished to write this second installment. The guess here is that it needed a *lot* of editing. Truth is, it could have taken a lot more. This book is 40 percent too long for its own good.    Oh, I enjoyed it - sort of. He's a fine writer (with some exceptions; see below) and he did manage to string me along. That's the way I felt about \\"Name of the Wind,\\" too: it was a bit of a chore to finish, but I did, and that is to his credit as a writer.    Some issues here:    1) The conceit of telling the story in three \\"days\\" just doesn't wash. This book took 40+ hours to listen to; unless the days in Kvothe's world are twice as long as ours, and they all stayed up all night, this didn't take one \\"day.\\" (And remember, this is verbatim what he's telling Chronicler, so there is no excuse there.) Had Rothfuss (and his editors) recognized this disconnect, perhaps it would have inspired some much needed trimming.    2) Rothfuss is a fine writer. But at this ungodly length, it seems even he got lazy, or more likely, tired. Usually good at turning a simile (though far too often here he uses three when one would have done), by the last hours (i.e. pages) of this novel he was resorting to cliche after cliche - \\"wet as a drowned rat,\\" \\"knocked me over with a feather,\\" etc.     3) Melodrama. Far, far too often, Kvothe's various foils (Albaran, Denna, Bast, Vashet, etc.) seesaw wildly in their emotions, one momentseething with fury and freaking out, literally the next turning meek with forgiveness or a wee smile. A couple times you might buy, but Rothfuss does this so often that it strains credulity and makes the reader painfully aware that's it's just cheap melodrama. Manipulative and false, it makes these people seem like, well, jerks. Or crazy. Or bipolar. Or borderline. Or something.    4) Like other reviewers, I see this book as more a collection of long tales - \\"The Further Adventures of Kvothe the Kingkiller\\" - than a novel. Rothfuss is meandering, plain and simple. The tales are interesting in their own right - Felurian, the Adem, Alveron, the Cthaeh, the bandits and Cinder (it is fascinating to hear these names pronounced and only later see them spelled out) - but they honestly don't do much to push the main story forward. (Or perhaps they do; perhaps Rothfuss really is a genius and will make all these comments moot with a spectacular finish.)I will say that the book's final twist was a nifty one; perhaps not totally unexpected, but nifty even so.    I liked the book enough to listen to it for more than 40 hours. But honestly, as I approached the end I had some of the same feeling I get when running a marathon: I couldn't wait to cross the finish line and take a break.    I'm sure I'll take up the next one when it's written. Here's hoping it's less indulgent and more focused than \\"The Wise Man's Fear.\\"

In this cae though, how many times do we wonder if we are in the right work, or someone comes to us to inquire about their career? This set of cards helps clear the way in understanding what we are natuarlly gifted in, and helps open us to move in that direction. On another note the artwork is wonderful and the use of color is soothing and calming to the spirit as we use them. This deck of cards has a lovely \\"Old World\\" feel about it.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|It was a minor war crime that this wasn't nominated for Best Picture. The Academy could not get past the fact that a movie about a man who dresses as a bat and fights crime could also be one of the greatest movies of 2008--not to mention the highest grossing.<br /><br />Nolan does not bog down the series with ridiculous gadgets or farfetched characters. His Joker comes out of nowhere, and recks havok where ever he goes. he is the ultimate real world supervillian: an unrepentent serial killer who just wants to watch the world burn--a stripped down approach that I didn't originally believe would work.<br /><br />It features one of the smartest and most exciting action sequences ever recorded on film: Batman tries to save hostages dressed as villians while fighting off both the real villians and the Gotham SWAT team, who think the hostages are the villians.<br /><br />At the heart of this film is the surprisingly uplifting message that people are not as cynical as one might expect. \\"Not everyone is as ugly as you!\\" Batman tells that Joker.

B004G600A4|4.0|The 50th animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, \\"Tangled\\" is a little less flashy and a little less hectic than the average animated feature these days, hewing closer to \\"reality\\" than most such films - if one can stretch that term to include a tale of a beautiful, tower-dwelling princess whose blonde tresses glow when she sings, and whose \\"Prince Charming\\" comes in the form of a roguish thief whose face is plastered on wanted posters all over the countryside.  But \\"Tangled\\" doesn't overplay its hand in the storytelling arena.  There are no fire-breathing dragons, no talking animals, no over-extended action sequences (or at least no more than necessary).  The focus is mainly on two attractive and likable characters coming to know and accept one another throughout the course of their adventures.<br /><br />The adventure begins when Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), who has just turned eighteen, decides she wants to leave the castle in which she's been locked away by an old crone posing as her mother - it turns out Rapunzel's hair confers eternal youth on anyone who touches it - in order to experience what life is like in the outside world.  Rapunzel finally gets her wish when the thief, Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) - who's fleeing the law and the two cohorts he's just betrayed - attempts to hide in her tower, which he assumes is empty.  However, he gets more than he bargained for when he meets this naïve but feisty young woman who sees him as the opportunity for escape she's been pining for all these years.  So off they go to see the world, with many an unexpected adventure awaiting them along the way.<br /><br />\\"Tangled\\" is a little more deliberately paced than the typical kids' flick - indeed it takes a full half-hour before we even get outside the tower room - and the scenes run a little longer than usual, as Rapunzel and Flynn take the time to establish a relationship of mutual respect and trust.  The humor is gentle and the tone sweet, yet there is just the right amount of starch in the characters of the crone (nicely voiced by Donna Murphy) and Flynn's aggrieved criminal cohorts to keep things from getting too sappy.  The soft-focus backgrounds provide an appropriately comfy setting for the tale, and the musical numbers (by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater) have an appealing Broadway show-tune brassiness to them that lifts the audience's spirits.<br /><br />As written by Dan Fogelman and directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard, \\"Tangled\\" doesn't come sailing out of the wings, as so many similar recent films have done, trying to impress us with its postmodern revisionism and cynical self-awareness.  It tweaks some of the elements of the classic Fairy Tale genre to be sure, but it also acknowledges and respects those elements.  It really isn't in the business of tearing things down just so it can congratulate itself on its own iconoclasm and irreverence.  And I, for one, am tremendously grateful for that.amount of starch in the characters of the crone (nicely voiced by Donna Murphy) and Flynn's aggrieved criminal cohorts to keep things from getting too sappy.

B001C4CI8U|3.0|I watched the first season of Fringe, expecting that I would love it, and it would be a must-see series for me.  Conspiracy theories, weird sci-fi stuff, action, twists and turns. But after seeing the entire first season, I just wasn't sucked in.  \\"Fringe\\" is good, but not great.    The first part of the season is too formulaic: weird thing happens, \\"Fringe\\" investigates, some tense action sequences, some clues about a bigger conspiracy are revealed. This was the first 10 episodes, and I nearly stopped watching.  But others here said to watch the next 10, so I did, but I still do not feel compelled to continue to spend my energy with this. I would like to, I really would, but it's just not there for me.    I have a feeling Anna Torv is a good actress, but she is given limited emotions to act. Sort of like Jill Hennessey of Law & Order; you know she's trying to squeeze the juice out of the lines, but it's just not enough. And it's not enough to make me really care about her character. John Noble is fun as Dr. Walter Bishop, and he is fun to watch. I am dismayed how chronically underused Joshua Jackson is as Peter Bishop. His purpose in the series seems to be making sarcastic comments and being the straight man for his odd father. Some hints about a shady past were presented in the first season, but nothing's come of them so far. Joshua Jackson must've been soothed by the writers that he will do more in the series; otherwise I would have quit the role. His character does not inspire much empathy either.     Some of the plot twists and revelations are obvious. Some seem too manufactured to be credible. Maybe too much is focused on the plot twists and turns and not enough is focused on the past lives of these characters or how they interact with their outside world to make them more human and likeable and for me to care about what happens to them.    I can see why others really enjoy \\"Fringe\\" and eagerly anticipate the next episode. But there is just not enough for me,and for others I'm sure, to continue watching.
B000A7DVR2|1.0|I've heard about this movie for years.  Finally sat down and watched it, with great expectations.  Total disappointment.  I cannot believe this piece of junk is from the same guys who wrote Fargo.  This movie is so self-conscious and full of itself that its every attempt at humor is infused with desperation and heavy-handed \\"cleverness.\\"  Lots of profanity-laced, repetitive tirades masquerading as hilarious dialogue.  (Enough with the f-word already . . . it stops having any impact at all after the first few times and then just comes across as puerile and immature.)  What a waste of time of time and Oscar-nominated (in other films) talent.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This is a terrible movie! Unbelievable, silly, immature, frustrating, moronic characters, silly plot, bad acting, and the monster is tragically ho hum.    The movie does not get going until about 17 minutes after the opening. You have to sit and watch a going away party for a friend, but it's more like a teenage romance gossip festival. The cameraman \\"Hud\\" tries to pick up his crush using middle school tactics and is so annoying you are hoping the monster eats him first. The character doesn't get any better. Hud spews out what I assume are bits of comic relief at unfunny moments in the movie all while holding on to the camera and recording.     The actors continue to use the camera throughout the entire ordeal. The camera survives the monster attacking, crashes, burials, other monsters and other trauma. Who makes this camera? I want to buy one if it can stand this much punishment!    The monster, when revealed, looks boring, uninteresting, and not frightening. Unusual, yes, but for some reason, not particularly compelling to look at. I went ahead and looked at some of the extras and was amazed and how much effort seemed to go into creating this monster, when the results were so bland.    The acting from all cast members is disappointing and unbelievable; Hud especially. I never believed any of them were in NY running from a monster; I believed all of them were in a movie. I had to laugh out loud at one of the last lines of the movie when the guy points the camera to the girl and she says that she can't think of anything to say.     The plot is awful. The army seems to arrive on Manhattan with tanks, medical equipment and scores of troops in 15 minutes, even with a bridge destroyed. People are mortally injured or should be and seem to have no problem getting up and running for their lives.    My wife finally asked me to stop critiquing this movie because I kept pointing out so many bad things about it. I could do more analyzing here, but I have better things to do.

It takes a little while to get used to and to get it set up just so but once you do, it easily beats out any other out there. the only complaints I have about it is in symbol mode (numbers) the space key is very small, sometimes when I go to press the &apos;m&apos; key I accidentally hit the delete key instead, and occasionally I&apos;ll hit one of the arrows instead of the space key. I really like the fact that there are dedicated keys for certain punctuation, but would really like the option to remove the SwiftKey\/voice button.
1936719118|5.0|Derek Silver, founder of CDBaby.com, is an unconventional entrepreneur. Somebody who follows his own rules. Luckily, he stayed true to his \\"philosophy\\" with this book; the book has only 88 pages. Something that many (all?) big publishers would dismiss to be published.    I loved reading the book. It's full of pearls of wisdom for any entrepreneur. Especially his view on formalities, hiring people and the quest for growth (or lack of it) makes it a fantastic read.    I think EVERY entrepreneur should read IDEAS ARE JUST A MULTIPLIER OF EXECUTION (and its corresponding \\"formula\\"). It \\"quantifies\\" the value of execution and puts the factor \\"idea\\" into perspective. i.e. an extremely low value.    It made me laugh, that the value of a \\"brilliant idea\\" and \\"brilliant execution,\\" equivalents exactly to the sales price of CDBaby.com.    Franco  CEO SmarterComics.com

1594202842|5.0|but there were certainly parts of the book that resonated with me and were eerily familiar.    I won't rehash all the criticisms or defenses, so I'm just gonna be honest and candid with this review.      It was hilarious.  I laughed so much during this book, much like a traumatized person sometimes has to do when reading about their own life, and it was very well-written.  I remember playing violin for three hours a day (I was great, and wouldn't have been without that push), I remember my dad ordering me collectible stamps one-sheets at the age of 8(and then having me write a two-page paper on the information, doing more research if I didn't have enough content.  I'm a great writer now), I remember doing the math workbooks you could find at the bookstore and working two grades ahead (I am miserable at Math.  So they dropped the ball on that one) and I remember being held to the highest standards of courtesy, respect and dignity when in public and with relatives (but really, shouldn't all kids?).    I remember being pushed to always do better and I wouldn't be successful as I would be now if my parents hadn't.  Honestly, the Chinese do hold their children to higher standards, and those Asians out there that disagree had weird parents.  I didn't mind being raised \\"in the Chinese way\\" at all.  Mind you, it was a bit more subtle than the way that Amy Chua recounts, but it was definitely the Chinese way.  I was allowed to pick my passions and pursuits. But my parents made sure as heck that if they were paying for my pursuits, that I'd better excel at them, above and beyond the rest of the pack.    Brava, Amy Chua.  Thank you for a wonderful, humorous, accurate and nostalgic trip back into my childhood.  You did a great job.

1441892168|5.0|This is yet another well produced-directed-acted show in Colonial Radio Theater's incredibly diverse selection of radio dramatizations.  J.T. Turner (A Night With Aesop, Father Brown) is pitch-perfect as Scrooge. You should be very familiar by now of the story of the miser who hated Christmas and is redeemed by his dead business partner and three ghosts of Christmas.    Suffice to say this is one of many fine shows done according to the source material and simply another fine way to spend the holiday.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|Really enjoyed the adaptation from the novel 'Sahara' written by Clive Cussler.  Lots of action, and followed the story line very well.  I thought the actors portrayed the characters the way Cussler has them written on paper.  Very well cast.

B003TU163I|4.0|well after my 1st pair of Tevas lasting only 15yrs, i broke down & got a new pair...  yes, i know these sandals are pricey but if they hold up anything like the last pair, its really a bargain.  i wear sandals the most part of 3 seasons a year, daily walking, vacations, camping/hiking in the river, lake, ocean, any & everywhere.  these new Terra Fi 3's have got all the latest upgrades... 1st off the strap system is the best out there, don't get me wrong, i like my Keen's a lot, but i enjoy the feel of the Teva's even more.  2nd they have this shock pad system that is a great enhancement over the older tevas.  (i read some reviews on how the shock pad was uncomfortable & even causing problems, & after reading further, i found there was a bad few batches from the factory in the beginning of production, but that has all been rectified now according to Teva; & my pair are doing fine.  3rd the foot bed & sole of the sandal are firm, yet its not too firm as to be uncomfortable, another improvement from what i have worn in the past.  Finally there is this new spider rubber on the tread... can't really speak good or bad on it because its unnoticeable to me, i haven't slipped yet, so i guess it works.    well its another great sandal from Teva, (what else would you expect).  i also have a pr of the Teva Zilch & as my every day sandals; i save these for the more extreme surfaces of hiking, beaches & such.    can't go wrong with a Teva on you foot.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|As an avid Castle viewer I was not diappointed.  The book is just like the TV show in that the lead character is a sexy, smart, and sassy NYPD detective saddled with babysitting a famously handsome ladies-man writer and backed up by a funny yet competent detective duo.  Best part is the sexual tension we see on the TV is actually played out on the pages of this book.  Cant wait to read the next book in the series.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Being Norwegian I can tell you the accuracy is very good. The story and acting is wonderful. Loved the Stan Lee Cameo.<br />Playful, funny, perfect to the spirit of what the Norse Gods were described as. I personally always like the descriptions of the realms, the way they unfold it in the Movie makes perfect sense. There was a line toward the beginning of the movie I particularly agree with. \\"Who's to say beings from another demention didn't come here centuries ago and a primitive culture like the Vikings worshiped them as Gods\\"? Great line and a nice thought. The choice of Anthony Hopkins to play Odin Allfather was PERFECTION!!!! Chris Hensworth was also perfect for Thor, his brother Liam is far too young. I can't wait for the Avengers and the next Thor Movie. Keep them coming! OOF TA!

B003XDZLTG|5.0|A few years back I found a pair of silver shayna style at a local big lots store in the 5 dollar deals bin. I bought them as outside shoes to take the dog out in, etc. When I later got a job in health care they became my go-to shoes. I could wear them during the day with comfort and they still looked good to go with my business casual attire at night (I work second shift) I bought a cheap grab back of jibbits on Ebay and I got all kinds of compliments because no one had ever seen Mario/hello kitty jibbits before :)    Sadly I woke up this mornign to find half of my one of crocs in my 12 wk old puppies mouth. I have no idea HOW he managed but I'm sure their age played a factor.    Best-most comfortable shoes i've ever had, I'll miss em but, i'm excited to buy a new pair :)
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Our main character in this book is Rose who I took an instant like to. She seems quirky and innocent in her ways which I think is mainly due to the sheltered life she has lived. I loved the fact that I found her funny without her even trying which only made her character more likeable. There seemed to be so much in life she had missed out on which only left me rooting for her to tackle all the things she wants to do in life.    I also really enjoyed the character of the next door neighbour Joe. We know he is keeping secrets which only make his character more mysterious and intriguing. Even though I couldn't work out if he was a good guy or a bad guy I still found his character so likeable. I enjoyed the relationship between the two characters.    The storyline to this book is so intense there is just something happening all the time which meant I couldn't put it down as I needed to know what was going to happen next. What I enjoyed most about this book was the suspense factor. I kept chopping and changing my mind with what I thought was going to happen and all in all I was wrong! Just as I thought the story was starting to wrap up something else would happen so to say I was then on the edge of my seat is a slight understatement!

1439102724|5.0|This may be my favorite Piccoult book to date and I really do love her earlier works. The story touches so many nerves. Yes, there are disturbing and upsetting aspects but the author handles them deftly and with respect. It is obvious that she does the necessary research. Not everyone will be able to emotionally handle the book's content and perhaps that is the reason they do not like it, however, this story is well crafted and although some of the character's display strong extremist beliefs, these people do exist and they happen to be a part of this particular story. One of the questions I always ask myself when reading any novel is could this story really happen? Does it ring true? The answer here is a resounding yes. The only thing I did not care for was the musical CD that was created to highlight the story. First of all, it wasn't necessary. The book offered all the right tools to get a sense of the characters. Secondly, I am simply not a fan of the Indigo Girls, folksy genre. The CD is designed to be played along with reading the story and the tracks are conveniently earmarked to correspond with the appropriate chapters so the reader gets a deeper sense of what Zoe is feeling in the moment since the music is created from her perspective. It is an interesting concept however, I would never interrupt the reading to stop and play a song. That for me would ruin the experience. I did listen to the entire CD after I was finished reading the book and again just wasn't a fan of the music nor did I get any additional perspective on the book.<br /><br />Check out my book review blog: [....]

B0011HOEYY|5.0|Despite some local purists upset that the characters were not 'true to life' --- its a very well done movie. Chronicled a time in history not widely known. My thought after seeing the movie - and seeing some critiques regarding the characters, is that anyone has the ability to have their version of the story portrayed.  This version was the first widely released, acting was fantastic by both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe with fine performances by much of the supporting cast.        ** NOTE THAT THIS PARTICULAR OFFERING FROM THIS SELLER DOES NOT include a book as pictured ***
0307472841|2.0|The book opens well with a grisly scene of mass murder but MfromB then runs into deep problems, not the least of which is that very early on the mystery of the murders is fully explained. With the mystery element wrapped up there is little to propel the reader forward except for character development. Unfortunately, the central character, a female Swedish judge, is a bore. She does a little detective work but is soon buffeted by events of which she can do nothing but be confused. The events themselves are bizarrely improbable--the judge goes to Beijing, a city of 20 million people, and shows a picture of a Chinese man to someone she meets accidentally who, of course, recognizes the man. (For those who have read the book - do note that that mugging and meeting with Hong appear to purely accidental since Hong didn't arrange it and neither did her brother who doesn't know about the judge until much later.)    The Swedish judge also behaves in a way completely out of character when required for the plot--as, for example, when she breaks into a crime scene to retrieve a diary--no way a responsible judge is going to do that. As another example, when fearing for her life instead of using her many contacts with the Swedish police she runs off to London to take shelter with a Chinese woman whom she has met only once.    There are also a number of side characters who you think are going to go somewhere but never do, like the female detective who is setup in an interesting way early on but then disappears or the reporter who literally does nothing in the book but call the judge repeatedly saying \\"I know there is more to this story. Please tell me.\\" The judge always hangs up on him. What on earth is he doing in this story?    I actually found the bit in the middle about China and Africa mildly interesting but it has little to do with the plot and the author's pro-Mao, pro Communist-party speeches, put into the mouths of more than one character, are a bore.    The ending is totally random and unsatisfactory.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I&apos;ll never understand why this game is so popular. It&apos;s a very poor variant of the typical browser based artillery game but with cartoon birds to attract the casual game crowd where a castle &amp; catapult would not. There are much better games in this genre.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|The most heart breaking part of this story is that it seems to be written by a child. Jaycee's book contains simple language and grammatical errors on every page. This adds to the shock factor of this memoir. Since she was captive her whole life, Jaycee never got to attend school or grow up as a normal person would. She will forever be stunted in ways that we can never imagine. This book hits me particularly hard because I am also from northern california where Jaycee was taken hostage. I remember being a naive 10 year old little girl going to school every morning and wondering why my parents acted the way they did. That could have happened to me as a child if my parents let me walk to school. I used to get angry at my parents for sheltering me so much. Now I thank them for protecting me. I'm very suprised that Jaycee didn't become a drug addicted vegetable. Most people who go through such trauma normally turn to drugs or other ways of self medicating. I applaud her for picking her life up and writing this book. It must have been so difficult for her to recall all of the grisly details of her captivity and show them to the world. She is very brave. This book reminded me to be greatful for everything I have today.
B000JQU4TW|3.0|I wanted to give this four stars, but I just couldn't. This was not a comfortable read for me; in fact, it was quite difficult for me to finish.

Once Dorian makes the acquaintance of Basil's friend, Lord Harry, however, Dorian is fascinated by Lord Harry's worldly and cosmopolitan views. In a burst of youthful enthusiasm, Dorian wishes for the picture to bear the physical outcomes of his actions so that Dorian can retain his beauty. He soon discovers that his wish has been granted. Adopting Lord Harry's way of life, Dorian descends into a lifestyle of vice and pleasure seeking and perversely (and childishly?) anticipates the devastation he can wreak on the portrait without bearing any evidence on his own physical form.<br /><br />The levels of Harry's influence, Dorian's self-destruction, and Dorian's blindness to the true elements of his fall from \\"goodness\\" combined to make for a powerful read.

The film delves deeply into the lives of two very different women, who are thrown together by fate and circumstances.  Peyton, the out the closet lesbian writer meets Elena, the \\"straight\\" conservative wife of a Minister. Both woman struggle with the increasing attraction for each other, as the sexual tension builds.    A friendship soon turns into a love affair.  The film is filled with HOT love scenes; the actresses Traci and Necar are absolutely gorgeous and portray their rolls perfectly.  Nicole Conn as a Director and writer, always manages to capsulate  the essence of a \\"woman\\".  A story well told.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|\\"The Conspirator\\" covers an event little known to most Americans.  That is, the trial of Mary Suratt for allegedly conspiring in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and the attempted assassinations of Andrew Johnson (Vice President) and William Seward (Secretary of Sate).  All are to some degree aware of Lincoln's demise.  Few would have any knowledge of the broader conspiracy.<br /><br />Robert Redford is to be commended for bringing this story to a wider audience. However, as with much of Redford's work, there is broader underlying theme.  In this case, it is the use of almost summary justice whereby individuals can be tried before a military commission rather than a jury of their peers.  For Mary Suratt, it was almost as if the result had been pre-determined.  The North was in a vengeful mood and nothing was going to stop Mary Suratt from being found guilty.  She was never to be allowed a fair trial.<br /><br />The obvious analogy being worked here is the current events in Guantanomo Bay.  Detainees have been held for years without any real prospect of facing a fair trial.  Justice has been allowed to take a back seat to revenge.  This is a shame.  America is better than this and herein lies Redford's point.  Liberty must always trump fear.<br /><br />\\"The Conspirator\\" is good without being great.  It is skillfully made and never fails to grab the viewer's attention.  If I was to find criticism, it is that Redford can sometimes try a bit too hard.  Has he allowed the Suratt story to become just a bit too concocted in the process of making a political point?  Arguably, yes.  Nonetheless, the story never fails to captivate.
1451629184|5.0|It is amazing how she writes in such detail of her time in captivity with her kidnappers. It was almost like a fictional story, as her life seems like such an impossibility. Unfortunately, it is possible, and everyone needs to hear her story.     It is a very easy read, as it is written much like the way she would say it. However, it can be graphic at times and I would not recommend it for anyone that feels uncomfortable with sexual situations. She really spares no details with her rapes and living conditions.     After reading the book, I think you will be able to understand what she went through and why she did not try to escape. For 18 years all she knew was that backyard and her kidnappers. She was brainwashed into thinking the outside world was bad, and they were keeping her safe.     I wish her and her family the best, and anyone else that was affected by the heartbreaking story. If you are going to buy yourself a book, I highly recommend this one. You'll be glad you did.
B000JVSUS4|5.0|To describe this movie as incredible would be be an understatement! I purchased the blu-ray edition, with the colors being so vivid, I can't imagine watching it in a regular format. The battle scene in Pearl Harbor was some of the best special effects photography I have ever scene. This was also a very unique romance plot, with several surprise aspects that will keep your mind challenged, with quite a surprise ending.  I was surprised that the bombing of Tokyo was part of this movie. It added another hour to the movie, but was worth it! The director of the movie went to a lot of detail to assure accuracy. I recently saw a documentary about this portion of the movie that verified the accuracy.  JTB
B0009UC810|4.0|It's funny at times, but for me the best this movie has to offer is seeing some of the biggest names in \\"Blues\\" music perform...such as \\"John Lee Hooker\\" gotta \\"Respect\\" Franklin...
B002YOKVU4|2.0|I was disappointed with this movie. I knew about the heavy amount of drug scenes before I saw this movie, and enjoy Johnny Depp movies, but this movie was a little too far out for me.   JTB
0439023521|4.0|First Harry Potter, then Twilight, and now the Hunger Games?? I'm turning into a teenager!    I really wasn't sure what to expect with this book. It was sad, depressing, hopeful, romantic, and exciting all at the same time. Although the premise is very violent, I feel like the actual violence and gore is kept to a minimum. The story line is pretty predictable, but that didn't stop me from turning the page. The only really annoying thing was all of the kissing in the 2nd half (whether it was real or not!). I was also a little surprised by what a girly girl Katniss could be - I thought she would be totally against a makeover and getting fussed over by the stylists!    All I can say is, I hope I don't live long enough that North America (or the world) becomes anything like Panem. I guess it doesn't really matter since I'm not aged between 12 and 18!    I've already ordered the other 2 books in the series and can't wait until they arrive. I hope it explains more about Panem - like how do you get to live in the Capitol? What is life like in the other districts? And of course, more about an impending Katniss-Peeta-Gale love triangle.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I couldn't put it down,  It was stunning and creative.  I recommend it to people who are not fettered by strong religious views about the afterlife.
B004EPZ070|3.0|This movie is very funny and, for the most part, very well cast.  The friends I watched it with enjoyed it enough to go out and read the book (or stay in and read the book -- they have kindles ;)    That said, don't watch this movie expecting the book. Something Borrowed is one of my favorite books and this film, while enjoyable, is vastly different. I missed the Dex character from the book. He was flawed but not in such a way that it made me lose respect for him as it does in this version. John Krasinski steals every scene he is in and I ended up rooting for him over Dex.
0553801473|3.0|I gave the book three stars because George finished the book, which hopefully allows him to get back to telling the story he originally planned on writing back in 1999.  I'm still a fan, I'll still buy the next book, but I'm disappointed.  The publisher/GRRM/HBO/world need to insist on a new Editor.<br /><br />Imagine AGOT ending with John and Tyrion in Mole's Town, Dany having just watched her brother die, Bran still in a coma and Ned and the girls still on the Kingsroad.  Take those stories but add another 500 pages of needles POVs, descriptions of food, wildlife, torture, fake deaths, rape and brigand attacks, all of which do nothing to advance the central plot intrigue setup in the opening pages: What happened in Kingslanding, what's happening north of the wall and who is Daenerys and why should I care?  You've now got a book on a level with ADWD.<br /><br />Ending almost half of the characters' story arcs just prior to their presumed climax is not a cliffhanger, it's 3/4 of a book.  George spends the resolution of book 3 and the opening of book 5 laying out the foundations for this book's plot lines, most of which approach yet never reach a conclusion.  Of the characters we've waited 10 year to hear about, Tyrion, Daenerys, John, Davos and Theon, only John and Theon have what can be considered a story arc.  The other three do nothing (Daenerys, Davos) or travel to a point with ridiculously contrived injections of suspense (Tyrion), all of which just prove to lengthen the journey to a point where the author can't even accomplish why he set out to write this particular entry in the series.  This surely damns the The Winds of Winter into containing 200 pages wrapping up all the remaining plot lines which should've concluded in this book.  I can only pray that if George ever gets to it, he doesn't write 400 pages detailing Daenerys sailing to Westeros with descriptions of seabirds, ship boy raping, checkers tournaments, seasickness, deck swabbing, sail stitching and weevils.<br /><br />People say that George flouts conventional fantasy and fiction stereotypes, but IMO a book should always have its own purpose with in the overall series arc, while still being able to tell its own story with its own themes.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I've read all of the books in English and three of them in French, seen all of the films up to this one, and have enjoyed the series immensely.  I have nothing but admiration for the creative mind of the author--well a little jealousy too perhaps.<br /><br />This was a great finale to a fine series of books and films.  While I was very disappointed in Part I, which was essentially a gorgeously filmed travelogue, and almost didn't go to Part II because of it, I'm glad I broke down and did. I'm still confused as to why they didn't get to the point and just do Deathly Hallows as a single film.  I assume the Deathlyl Hallows was going to be hideously expensive to make, and a less expensive Part I would help defray the cost of the whole without making the film prohibitively expensive to audience.  You saw Deathly Hallows on the installment plan so-to-speak!<br /><br />Part II is essentially a very \\"dark\\" film, both cinematically and metaphorically, but it brings about a d&eacute;nouement that has been building up for almost a decade.  The film follows the book closely with just a slight alteration in the role of the Snape character.  This was totally acceptable in my opinion, since although I could understand both his behavior and his motivation, I wasn't always certain that the books themselves made either very clear to the reader.  One had to do a lot of reading between the lines, which for an adult was not that difficult, but which for younger readers might have been.  I think it was important, because it revealed yet again that one cannot always assume one knows what's going on beyond the surface that people present to us.  I think it was also a good source of character development for Harry, since he came to understand at the moment of the man's death, that his life had been lived in almost constant sacrifice for the love of Harry's mother and for Harry himself.  It was a beautiful and well played role, and I think Alan Rickman deserves public acknowledgment for creating it so superbly.<br /><br />As usual for a \\"good versus evil\\" film, there are deaths of a number of familiar characters, but that happens in any war.  In fact the entire build up to the event would have seemed familiar to those who grew up before WWI and fought during it, and definitely to those who grew up to fight in WWII.  Likewise, characters that had been taken rather lightly as children grew up to take a far more active and dedicated role in these events than their friends would have expected or even they themselves might have predicted.  Even characters who had been considered evil, who may even have been evil at the moment, stepped up to the plate when it became obvious that no one could stand on the sidelines and expect to come out of the fray unaffected.  Nor were acts of courage, sacrifice, or kindness forgotten.  Wonderful lessons.<br /><br />A great climax to a beloved series.As usual for a \\"good versus evil\\" film, there are deaths of a number of familiar characters, but that happens in any war.

1932100660|5.0|This book exposes truths about the dairy industry that I never would have known about otherwise. I highly suggest this book to anyone interested in how what they consume effects their health. I'm fairly certain we've all seen the commercials that stress the importance of cows milk, this book explains in great detail the falseness of those ads.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This was a fun movie.  It was made more so by the restrained hand of the scriptwriter and the selective care of the director.  While it was an extremely improbable plot, and it would certainly have lent itself to complete kitsch or camp, it didn't seem to wander that direction at all.  It was played almost entirely straight like a classic western (a la [[ASIN:B00006JMRE High Noon (Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000059TFW The Magnificent Seven (Special Edition)]], and [[ASIN:0792163710 Shane]]) with just enough humor to break the tension in order to rekindle it to new heights later in the film.  Shakespeare would have been proud--Heck, Shakespeare would have had fun with the concept had it occurred to him!<br /><br />The story partakes of a bit of both sci-fi and the western, creating a sort of \\"what if?\\" ambiance.  It pits the grit of late 19th century Southwesterners intent on reclaiming their family memebers, dead or alive, or die trying against a higher tech race of aliens bent on taking over the planet--or at least its gold supply.  Though the weapons of the former are primitive by comparison to their enemies, their ability to bury their differences and risk their lives for a common goal is their strong suite.  Furthermore, it is ultimately not their vulnerability that counts but that of their alien enemies.  The aliens are at base no more immortal or immune to harm than humans are, and their apparent contempt for humans proves their undoing.<br /><br />The use of CGI in the film was admirably restrained.  In short it was never introduced to the point where it dominated the screen or the live actors on it.  The animated characters were there as the \\"bad guys,\\" not to impress us with the quality of computer graphics---with which even the elderly are probably more than familiar by now.<br /><br />The primary heroes were all consummate actors; Harrison Ford, who is very used to the concept of animation and blue screen techniques, seemed especially comfortable in his role, and Danial Craig was wonderful.  His deadpan affect was just what was needed in the role of anti-hero pressed into the service of mankind by circumstances.  I also appreciated the director's take on a well shaped derri&egrave;re framed by leather chaps!  The heroine, Olivia Wilde, was mysterious and engaging; her placement in a role of self sacrifice was moving; so often it is a male character that makes the ultimate sacrifice for human kind, making it seem as though women are either unwilling or incapable of doing so.  It was a good choice.  So was the fact that she did not return to give the film a standard \\"happy ending.\\"  Again a remarkable sense of restraint in a film that could have gone way over the top.<br /><br />In all an entertaining film.l Craig was wonderful.

B002ZG975Q|4.0|The movie was really good but the ending was lacking. The ending in the book gave so much more depth and feeling. It was portrayed almost perfectly in the alternate ending (WATCH IT! It's in the bonus features) so I don't get why it was the alternate ending. I would recommend reading the book first because it explained a lot more and went more in depth than the movie. But over all the movie was really fantastic. (Neil Patrick Harris was really good!)
0452286751|5.0|It's hard to know what else to say about a book like this because The Fountainhead has been praised, analyzed, discussed and criticized from all points of view by so many people.<br /><br />I will simply say that I think this book is terrific on every level.  The characters are unique and interesting and what they stand for ties them into Rand's personal philosophy of objectivism.  And although I think Rand's beliefs are extreme, I admire Roark's unwillingness to compromise his designs.  Rand's ability to develop these characters, weave them into a complex and interesting story and keep the reader going through all 700+ pages is a genius accomplishment that stands the test of time.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is the friendship that develops between Roark and Wynand because they both let down their guard and become human beings.  If you have to read this for school, be patient.  It is worth the effort and it will keep you thinking!
B004Y1USV2|4.0|I've been listening to Fly From Here for more than a month now and so far I'm still soaring from it. Got mine earlier thru a friend from Tokyo and the best part of having Japanese cd imports, you get bonus tracks. In this case, the full version of \\"Hour Of Need\\"- this track rocks from start to end. They should have released this version here in the states so as to prove to the naysayers that they're absolutely wrong in all aspects of this rejuvenated band. Pulled out my Yes catalog (feeling a bit nostalgic there) from day one and even the Buggles' Adventures In Modern Recording just for comparison's sake. Yep! It's there but this new release is not even close to being a Buggles' album. Video Killed The Radio Star? Wow, the intrigue! The comparison is pathetically lame. Drama? Maybe so but Drama had the raw heaviness of the eighties when disco, punk and new wave were at their peak. In my opinion, Fly From Here is definitely your Yes album - still progressive but melodious with less complexity yet classic. I love calling it progressive AOR. At this day and age, I don't expect any hits coming out of it. It's Lady Gaga and Black Eyed Peas all over the airwaves! We should all smell the coffee! This is Yes music for Yes lovers. Not the kind you'd be flaunting on the streets unless you want people staring at you. I really don't have to go into details of it's content and essence since most of you heard it and said your piece. Whether good or bad, it's your matter of opinion. For the past four decades, this band has been a progenitor of classic progressive rock and has spawned other bands of the same genre. Yes is a very unique band. The lineup kept on changing and still is. Where can you find a band that had more musical talents than anywhere else of this pedigree? Keyboardists, drummers, guitarists, even lead singers. Chris Squire is thus the last man standing! Well, of course, besides the Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman and Howe album which he's not involved in but Tony Levin (King Crimson, Peter Gabriel), still I consider it a Yes album. Yes is all about the music, not personalities. I love Jon for all he is but Yes is Yes, not Jon is Yes. The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts - think synergy. To each his own. Simply stated, I DON'T CARE who's who in it as long as the music gets my old and rusty prog engines running, no problem at all. As far as I'm concerned, Yes is a faceless entity - it does not identify itself with its members. If ever this band is to bring down the curtains due to the complexities of life and age, at least it ended with Fly From Here and perhaps time will be kinder to it for it to be their swan song and be part of the Yes legacy but even then, I still look forward to more great Yes music after Fly From Here. It is unfortunate for the overzealous purist who refuses this change to learn that this current release has the popular Yes logo printed and painted all over it with two coats even. BTW, love the Roger Dean artwork on Fly From Here - a very nice continuum for the box set, In A Word Yes (1969 - and add 2011 in it).(King Crimson, Peter Gabriel), still I consider it a Yes album.

B004Y1USJE|1.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a huge Yes fan. This however, is abysmal. Do I wish Jon Anderson was in the band and on this recording? Of course, but I gave up on that a while back. So this isn't based on the fact that Benoit David is in Jon's place.      I was going to approach this album with an open mind. I mean, I love Drama, and this is essentially the same lineup (with the addition of Benoit David). But this   makes \\"Big Generator\\" look like \\"Close to the Edge\\". Horrible..     The music is cheesy. And the centerpiece (Fly From Here) is a weak attempt to recapture the greatness of the epics that Yes churned out in the 70's. \\"Bumpy Ride\\" sounds like a goofy theme to some tv gameshow. I love Geoff Downes, but the keyboard sounds are extremely dated. \\"Hour Of Need\\" had promise, but it went nowhere. And the lyrics? Horrendous. \\"Riding a tiger\\"? More like \\"jumping the shark\\". Who comes up with these lyrics? The only saving grace is \\"Solitaire\\", and even that is limp considering Steve's solo pieces are a real treat. This album made me cry. I think they should hang it up...

B0054R6BFM|3.0|Overall: 3 1/2 stars<br /><br />Plot/Storyline:  3 3/4 stars<br /><br />It's a great idea, right? So cool of a concept that I read the article and purchased the book as soon as I could.  I love the concept, but am a little less enamored when it comes to the execution of the story and to matters of characterization.<br /><br />As far as it goes, I think it's a helpful book for teens. Any story that preaches that bullying and casual cruelties have consequences is a needed message. The issue becomes what responsibility Hannah has for her choice and if the punishment fits the crimes.  If nothing else, the discussions it opens up will be interesting.<br /><br />Hannah says to these people that what they did lead to what she did and, by implication, they should carry the guilt of that. I suspect most readers will think that in the case of one or two of the people they should have to live with and struggle with that. However, some of the people were rude, or ignorant, or mean, or even casually cruel, but it's arguable if it's fair to expect them to carry the burden of Hannah's decision - particularly in the case of a girl who was a victim herself or a guidance counselor whom she only met one time and set up for failure.<br /><br />While the premise is good, I couldn't help but think that it needed to take two paths -- one of benevolence and education toward people who could not have known or one of anger toward people who were truly reprehensible. The difficulty is her anger toward both groups as if their \\"sins\\" were equal. Ultimately, this choice will put some readers in the uncomfortable position of realizing they dislike, or disapprove of, a girl who took her own life.<br /><br />There was also the small detail that she threatened that if people didn't listen and pass it on that another party would make sure that the tapes got out - but I can't imagine that the adult recipient wouldn't contact the authorities based on details in the tape. I also can't imagine Hannah not knowing that.<br /><br />Lastly, the reason why Clay was on the list seemed too easy, a bit off a cop-out, even a cheat, since - without saying more - he stood alone.  This removed some of the power I might have felt.<br /><br />Characters: 3 1/4 stars<br /><br />There are two main characters here. Hannah and Clay. We meet the other characters who have received or will receive the take, sometimes during the course of Clay's travels around town as he listens, but mostly through Hannah's narration. As mentioned, when she speaks we also read Clay's reactions to her words. Clay is pretty likable character. Some of the other characters are villainous. Others seem like kids making stupid mistakes.<br /><br />I believe that we were supposed to see Clay as someone who could have saved her, if only he was more confident, if only he had listened to rumors less. For once, I don't think Hannah put the burden on someone else so much as Clay felt understandable guilt at not reaching out to her sooner. (Understandable in the sense of it being a natural reaction, not in the sense of being justified.)<br /><br />As mentioned, I had complex feelings toward Hannah. Obviously there's built in sympathy for her, but it was hard to read her deliberate cruelty toward others. Suicide can sometimes be a very angry act, a way to punish others for real or perceived grievances, and the choice can be made for what seems to the outside world to be petty, but feels like the weight of the world to the person in question. Understanding all of this doesn't change the fact that Hannah comes across as vindictive and looking for scapegoats.<br /><br />I don't get the feeling I was supposed to agree with Hannah completely, but I do get the impression I wasn't supposed to be as irritated with her as much as I was, which was about 60% of the time.  While teens are self-involved and this one was in a bad place, she was surprisingly difficult to root for in her efforts and I - yeah, I'm going to hell - never felt particularly saddened that the girl speaking had shuffled off this mortal coil.  The inherent poignancy of the story she was telling couldn't always rise above what seemed to be a need to punish. Think of Carrie, without the supernatural stuff, with 100% less pig's blood, and with more time on her hands and a tape recorder.<br /><br />On the plus side, there were a fair amount of minor characters, and the author did a pretty good job with them. I felt like I knew them.<br /><br />Writing Style:  3 3/4 stars<br /><br />Several nice moments, but in many ways this felt like a first book.  This book called for a balance between Hannah's telling her story and Clay reacting and also moving around town as he listened, and it never felt like the author quite worked out the right ratio. Many of the descriptions were good, places were described vividly in several cases, but at other moments it all felt a little flat.erent poignancy of the story she was telling couldn't always rise above what seemed to be a need to punish.

This book called for a balance between Hannah's telling her story and Clay reacting and also moving around town as he listened, and it never felt like the author quite worked out the right ratio. Many of the descriptions were good, places were described vividly in several cases, but at other moments it all felt a little flat.
0060558121|1.0|I understand Gaiman's establishment in the genre and his accolades. Considerably, American Gods has won the Hugo award (one of the most prestigious sci-fi awards). However, as a novel of fiction this book is a mediocre attempt at what really is a post-modern thematic inquiry into mythology and what that means. The narrative pacing is slow (nothing wrong with this) but it's problematic because it seems aimless for most of the book. Yes, the point is for the main character to introduce us to the various deities of world mythology in all of their regression and decrepitness. To me, it seems the purpose of this novel functions as a look at gods and how they've changed from the old establishments to the 'new' gods (technology, food, etc...) and their mythical impending battle. We are given small clever glimpses into who is where and their ambiguous purposes in America too. But all of this seems to fall short of what should really be happening: the art of telling the story. Although, Gaiman pulls some of this together in the end, one can't help wondering what the point of it all is except being a commentary on human nature and our society's beliefs. Rather, this would be a better essay in mythology and post-modernism mixed with philosophy of human belief structures because it doesn't work so well in this narrative.<br /><br />Some might be disappointed about how the deities are portrayed; degenerate, lecherous, and small. Mythology has a tendency to provide many with grand illusions of might and power. Gaiman makes a real statement here about this and my criticism doesn't fault him for this perspective. Overall, this novel really just lacks a compelling story and places an ambiguous importance upon once thriving gods that function aimlessly in the background of the story. I'd suggest reading some of the preview pages that Amazon provides and it may give you a glimpse of what is there.
0553801473|3.0|I have to say I love the Song of Ice and Fire series and I want to love this book too. However, I'm having a hard time getting into it. I'm about a third of the way through the book and bored. Most of the central characters are on their own. There is no interaction between the people you've grown to like so much. Instead GRRM is creating a lot of new and inconsequential characters. In an attempt to make them interesting he's describing their hair, clothes, background; but these characters add little to nothing to the plot. It feels like a waste of my time to read about them and I find myself skimming. I still have hope that something will happen to make me glad I read it. Hopefully \\"The Winds of Winter\\" will move a little faster.

0553801473|3.0|The delayed fifth novel in the maligned \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" saga \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" chronologically co-exists within the time period of the fourth book and beyond.  The political maneuvering grows convoluted and much of the action occurs between chapters.  A couple vague examples are where a fight or escape or other peril will begin at the end of a chapter to provide the clich&eacute; cliff hanger.  On the next character chapter, the fight or escape or peril is over and one reads the aftermath.  At least we have a lengthy description of the delicacies and wine at the dinner table though.<br /><br />The primary individual chapters are Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and Tyrion.  Bran, Davos Seaworthy, and Theon Greyjoy compile the minor roles.  Jon has probably the best progress in the overall plot, maybe the book should have been titled, \\"Snowed in with Snow\\".  Daenery dispenses justice over her people while trying to maintain peace, disciplines dragons, meets diplomats, and dreams of sex.  Tyrion, as crude and funny as he can be, is the most entertaining in a painfully prolonged journey.  Theon's effectively captures his cruel environment, but very disturbing at times.  Arya and Bran each have a couple potent chapters.  Sansa and Rickon do not appear.  As strange as it may sound, I found one of the uniquely fascinating scenes involve Arya's face.<br /><br />After waiting 6 years for a novel supposedly near finished when \\"[[ASIN:0553801503 A Feast for Crows]]\\" was published, I'm very disappointed in the end product.  Tolkien is the only Tolkien, I will never say otherwise.  Martin has his own style with audacity and grittiness, something many appreciated in the first foundation building couple books.  The series isn't for everyone, but those writing reviews are the ones who more often than not gave glowing reviews on the initial installments.  I am one voice in a world where the author has made it clear many times he does not care what anyone thinks.  I wonder if it applies to those who positively placate his ego.  Reason I state it that way is because he does himself, his fans, and future fans a great disservice by not heeding any criticism by blinding himself like a naïve prince.  I think his initial potential is being squandered.<br /><br />A greater assortment of major and minor characters, from lords to stable boys, requires a more detailed appendix, perhaps a section in alphabetical order. A small dictionary of important words would be valuable.  Some portions of the map could have incorporated further detail especially the continents where the story relates.<br /><br />I recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.r if it applies to those who positively placate his ego.

B002T9H2ME|5.0|Moon is one of my favorite movies of all time. Sam Rockwell's performance truly is amazing. The story, dialogue, the music and the hybrid of miniatures and CG are all fantastic. The Blu-ray has great picture and sound quality and some decent extras including a short film by the director, Duncan Jones.

B003ASLJRW|4.0|\\"Pale Rider\\"(1985) is directed by Clint Eastwood. Eastwood portrays a priest who wanders into a mining town and helps a group of miners to deal with a group of thugs who work for an adjacent competing mining operator. There is also a small role played by \\"Jaws\\" from James Bond.<br /><br />The movie appears to be remastered and is a very clean transfer, which was a pleasant surprise after viewing \\"Hang Em High\\", which was a poor transfer. Sometimes the clarity or detail isn't what one would hope from a blu-ray, but that is probably the result of the camera work and not the actual transfer.

0060899220|5.0|Ah, the book that started it all.  I am a HUGE Bourdain fan.  I like watching him on TV, I like his philosophy on food and I like his (crass) attitude with people, etc.  So it finally dawned on me to get his book - the one he originally wrote which kick-started this whole Bourdain-on-TV all the time.  It's really good.  I like the way he writes, and you can hear his voice in your head a-la No-Reservations voice-over.  I haven't finished it yet, but I am enjoying it immensely.  I would love to meet him someday, even if I am too chicken to eat anything other than beef and chicken.  I do drink, though!
0375714839|5.0|I read this book in just two sittings. This was the first time I read a graphic novel and I really enjoyed it... Although the subject in the book is far from happy, the writer is able to make you laugh on her way of telling the story. I think it is very interesting to learn about the history of Iran in this format, it made very easy to understand certain subjects and provided as well some more topics for future reading. This was the first graphic novel I read and I will give it a try with others.
0553801473|2.0|I give the first two books of the series four stars, the third five stars, and the last two have earned two stars.  Mr. Martin, whose talents are prodigious when he is focused, either needs a stronger editor or stronger self-editing.  Half of the book is wasteful filler.  There are certainly strengths, such as the return and arc of certain characters, but I was amazed at the unbelievable lack of progress at the end of ONE THOUSAND pages.  You can find more actual plotting in many books a third the length.  Moreover, many of the primary characters (once a strength of the series) have become dull and one-note.  Some of the secondary characters were much stronger.<br /><br />I'm not one of those angry with the numerous delays.  Mr. Martin has numerous projects, as befits a man of his talents, and (quite obviously) has a right to live his life as well.  I daresay that many that had achieved his success and economic freedom might be equally inclined to seek more of a life in the work/life balance.  That said, I believe this book did his talent and his readers a disservice.  My opinion: he should have taken another year or two or three and delivered a book that had a plot and three-dimensional characters.<br /><br />If it is possible for a book that took six years (at least) to read as if it was rushed, this is it.
1596912863|5.0|Anyone who is a love her Pride and Prejudice or just loves Jane Austen will adore this book.     Jane is a closet Pride and Prejudice fan and it just may be what is making her \\"happily ever after\\" impossible. So when a wealthy relative dies and leaves Jane a mysterious gift that whisks her away to an English resort, her world is turned upside down.     Jane is pushed into Jane Austen's Regency world, included her very own Mr. Darcy. As Jane struggles to master this long forgotten world, she is forced to look at herself and what it is she really wants in her life.     As its heart, this is a wonderful story about finding yourself and realizing who you are. I loved this book, especially in a world where the idea of a perfect \\"movie\\" romance becomes expected and real life never seems to be able to compare to what your expatiations hold. This story is about getting what it is you think you want and realizing that maybe it wasn't all it's cracked up to be.
B003E6K1VK|4.0|I attached this to my iPod Classic using the L3 line out dock. About a 30% improvement in sound quality. More full bodied, MUCH better and tighter bass, more natural vocals. And all for less than $100. Pretty amazing. Also greatly improves computer audio sound when using mini USB connection.    Easy to operate and figure out, even without reading the somewhat  uninformative (and microscopic) instructions. If you want a headphone amp that works and you can take along, or a small unit to use with your computer, this is the ticket.    NG

B003ZSJ212|2.0|As a lifelong recovering Star Wars junkie, I figured my final 'big' purchase (as I quietly retire from the SW collecting world) would be the medium defining STAR WARS BLU-RAY discs. After all the hype over the past few years, I feel sort of empty and not as excited as I should about these. I was beyond thrilled to get the DVDs in 2004, just to be let down by the lack of technology that went into them. After some time, they became just another collectible and sold off most of what I had (including toys, books, cards, junk, etc) while there was still a market for the items. It's pretty sad when I find the Family Guy Star Wars spoofs more entertaining (and crystal-clear visually) then my childhood memories of the original flix. The last round of films (Episode I - III) were embarrassing at best.<br /><br />(Buzzkill Moment example: Darth Vader in Episode III, \\"Nooooooooooooooooooo!\\". Don't even get me started on the other 2 films. And you thought the Ewoks were bad....)<br /><br />(Show of hands: How many people are REALLY holding their breath for the LIVE ACTION Star Wars television shows?)<br /><br />I see the same trend with the Blu-Ray discs. Everyone excited and wants to see the extras, myself included, but do I want to spend $90 to do so? Looks like I might just wait until I see the set at a secondhand retailer for $50 or on Amazon for $25 in good condition. Over the past 30 years, I'm pretty sure I've padded Lucas' pockets with upwards of $300k in goods. What has he done for the fans besides rape our youth with subpar drivel and reworked classics? In the words of the classic The Who song, 'We won't be fooled again!'<br /><br />Use your better judgement before purchasing. Do your homework on the product before you buy. The Force isn't strong any longer...
031603441X|5.0|For anyone who survived the 60s and 70s, Keith's book is a trip . . .  back in time. Keith tells and shows us what it was like to be a very smart white rabbit on the inside of the Looking Glass looking out. We who listened to the music on the radio and watched the wild antics on TV were on the outside. Keith takes you with him where you've never been before. We get his distilled wisdom without having to pay the price of his hangovers, drug fogs, and police busts. Keith is discerning but unjudgmental, astute but unassuming, compassionate but honest. Keith Richards. Autobiography at its very best. Who knew?
B00505470O|4.0|As an aging guy in his mid-30's, I have recently found myself in a bit of a musical rut, and have been making the effort to explore some new artists and bands. In the process, I have heard some terms for supposed genres of music that I haven't heard before ... the first being \\"dubstep\\" (I still have no idea what that means, but I do love that SBTRKT dude) and now, \\"chillwave\\", which supposedly is the genre this album belongs to. Once again, I'm not sure exactly what that means, but I'm guessing it refers to mellow music that you can \\"chill\\" out to, that also has elements of New Wave in it as well.<br /><br />When I started listening to this album, I will admit that I felt a bit mislead. The album cover features two lovers in a sweet, passionate embrace, and I expected the album to immediately have a more erotic tone. But really, the first few tracks come across as breezy and summery, sort of the soundtrack to a meandering road trip on a lovely blue-skied day. Somewhere around the track \\"Far Away\\", however, the CD finally makes good on its promise of providing a soundtrack to sweet lovemaking. If the first half of the album sounds like a summery road trip, the second half sounds like lovers lying beside a campfire underneath the stars. The album closes with \\"A Dedication\\", a track driven more by piano and conventional vocals, which is a nice contrast to the textures and dreamy soundscapes that make up most of the rest of the CD. Overall, a lovely sonic road trip.

B001VS46DC|4.0|The thing about these jazz and Bossa Nova standards is that they have been done a zillion times by many singers. The amazing thing about these songs is that they allow plenty of room for interpretation.    In this concert, Diana Krall gives a gentle Bossa Nova spin to these standards. The subtle and understated beauty grows on you after each viewing as it did for me by the second time I played this.    The concert got off to a kicking start with I Love Being Here With You with some firework drumming from Jeff Hanilton. I also love her live renditions of Let's Face The Music And Dance and S'Wonderful. But what truly got the crowd going was when she did the Brazilian standards made popular by Astrud Gilberto right here in its birthplace of Rio De Janeiro. Quiet Nights, The Boy From Ipanema and So Nice drew plenty of enthusiastic audience participation.    My version had a bonus DVD featuring two live concert snippets and two casual performances at the Rio cafe. So don't hesitate to pick this one up!
031261246X|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from Mark's first novel, but what I found was a great read that increased in suspense to the point that I couldn't put it down until the end. Truly a chilling story that felt far too real, Zero Day entertained from beginning to end and reminded me how wild and woolly the Internet truly can be. Highly recommended for anyone who likes thrillers or is interested in technology.
B003INBOEC|1.0|This review is for the disc, not the movie.  I had never heard of this film but it came highly recommended so I ordered it.  Was enjoying it immensely when about an hour in the disc froze and would not play.  Rather than return it, I foolishly went online and searched for ways to solve this problem.  Nothing worked and now the bottom of the disc is all beat up and scratched to hell.  So I reordered it, but this time the standard version (not the Collector's Edition).  It played great.  A really terrific film.  Buyer beware I guess.  Maybe I just got a bad copy.  Still, worth seeing.
0553801473|1.0|I can only hope that the corpulent suet-monger George R. R. Martin reads some of the reviews from his \\"fans\\".<br /><br />Like many fans of A Song of Fire and Ice, I enjoyed the sub plots, I enjoyed the thwarted plans, and yes, I enjoyed the mortality of his star characters.  I enjoyed a story that kept me up all hours of the night because I couldn't bring myself to put the book down.  In his latest installment, he's tried to do those things that he did in the previous books that kept us on the edge of our seats, and failed horribly.  Don't get me wrong, I was on the edge of my seat all right.  Waiting for that huge plot turning event.  Waiting for so many of the sub plots to be resolved.  And waiting.  And waiting.  And waiting.<br /><br />*Potential Spoiler* (Though I'll try to be ambiguous)<br /><br />When I got to the third to last chapter I found myself literally shaking with anger and restraining myself from throwing the book against the wall.  I honestly felt (and perhaps still do) that if George Martin were in my presence, I would punch him in his smug, obese face.  I can see killing off main characters, it's good story telling, hell it's great story telling, but at a point where you should be tying up loose ends, it is a flat betrayal of his readers to kill off one of the most loved characters in the book for zero gain.  A character that was central to tying up what is looking to be quite literally half the story that has not even been touched yet.  It is this reader's take that he did it just because he could.  A veritable \\"f*** you, don't get too comfortable\\" to his fan base.<br /><br />The worst part?  Like so many other bright authors that burned out, I'll still buy the next book.  Simply out of morbid fascination to see what slop he'll feed us next.  Therefore, I concede defeat.  You've bested me, and so many other devoted readers who've been there since the beginning, waiting on every next installment.  Kudos sir.  A brilliant business model.  Enjoy your paychecks.<br /><br />In parting, I hope my sentiments are shared by some of my fellow readers.
0439023521|5.0|I'm giving the Hunger Games five stars for one simple reason: it's the first book I've read since the last Harry Potter that has managed to keep me up most of the night to finish.    I'm not saying it's a perfect book.  The writing itself is good but nothing spectacular, and I'm sure there could be improvements made.  Some people on here have been complaining that it steals from Japanese sources, which I wouldn't know.  And the themes certainly don't stack up to heavier novels.  But for what this book is, it excels tremendously.    Not only does Collins manage to tell her story so brilliantly, with just the right balance between action and suspense, that I literally did not want to put it down, she also manages to make dystopian fiction intriguing and relevent to contemporary young adults.  She presents a future world that is deceptively simple and incredibly believable and places conflicted characters in it.    Now all I have to do is not start the next book until I've had a chance to catch up on my sleep ...

0553801473|3.0|I almost decided not to review \\"Dance\\" as there are already so many reviews that express my feelings about the book better than I can express them, but here goes anyway:<br /><br />First of all, I really hate giving this book only 3 stars.  I so much wanted to love this book and I absolutely expected to give it 5.  I was glad to dance once again with my favorite characters as well as some fascinating new ones, but the music just didn't move me that much so the dances weren't all that exciting and didn't last that long.  I've waited 5 years with such great expectations but I'm afraid this book is a bit less than I expected considering all the hype and time that preceded it.  I still consider George Martin an astonishing writer, I still find all of the characters he creates superbly interesting and their journey well worth following, but the problem, from my point of view, is there was too little journey and way too much character.  I didn't review any of the previous books but if I had, I would give the first three 10 stars each.  I was absolutely enthralled, have read them each several times and hated to put them down for such mundane activities as eating and sleeping.  Altho I've also reread \\"Feast\\" I can only give it 3 stars as I found myself skipping through some POV's and yawning or getting up to do other things in the middle of a POV.  That's one of the main reasons I have waited so eagerly for Book #5.  I assumed it would redress the imbalance of \\"Feast\\" and take the story farther down the road.<br /><br />I'm not going to review the meat of the book as this has been done and redone already.  As has been said, there are copious descriptions (as only Martin can conceive) of food, landscapes, palaces, clothing, furniture, traveling, etc. and I actually enjoyed them as I am constantly amazed at his creativity...but only to a point.  After 500 pages, it began to drag on me and I felt the need for the beat of the music to accelerate.  I cannot critique what Martinis doing with the scope of the story.  This is his story and only he knows where he is taking it.  I have to trust that he knows what he is doing and that it will all come together spectacularly in the end, particularly considering what a great storyteller I consider him to be.  I just hope that the next books come sooner than 5 years apart.  Some of us may not be alive to finish it if he doesn't speed up.  I also hope he finds a REALLY GOOD EDITOR who is not afraid to slash and burn...I consider the editing of this book to be woefully inadequate.  I do, however, strongly recommend reading this book if you are as much of a fan of this series as I am...you must continue on the journey.<br /><br />George, I haven't given up on this story...in fact, when I read the last sentence in the Epilogue I HATED to close the book and leave Westeros, so please give us more and please, please, please start the music sooner rather than later.
0545128285|5.0|My son is giving this a 5 star rating. He loves this book. He is a hug Harry Potter fan.
0307346617|1.0|I'm a fan of zombie movies and thought I'd give this book a try for an easy, enjoyable read.  Plus, it had so many five star ratings...    Incredibly boring, characters interviewed are all nearly the same expect for the occasional, deliberate slang that appears to be the author's way of saying \\"Hey this guy's a Cuban!\\" or \\"This person is angry!\\".  There's plenty of political bias thrown in but I don't know if the author even meant to or knew he was doing it; he just assumes that the idiots in his book are the same as the idiots who disagree with him politically.  The actions of the 'idiots' (people at the beginning of the book who make the zombie situation worse through their greed and stupidity) are laughable and not believable, such as army generals who can't figure out how to fight slow moving zombies and soldiers who forget to shoot at their heads.  As a military veteran of twenty years, I nearly lost it during the description of the 'Battle of Brooklyn' and Brooks's countless other false characterizations of service members.  It appears that his knowledge of military matters comes from Hollywood movies like Pearl Harbor and Rambo.  Mr Brooks attempts to cover a wide range of topics and geographic locations and shows that he only possesses limited knowledge and plenty of bias.  Did I also mention it was incredibly boring?  I have no clue why so many people like this book.

0802714544|2.0|I read one novel by John Le Carre before: Our Kind of Traitor, which was terribly disappointing. Th Spy, on the other hand, has been included in the list of top 100 novels of the century by Time. I picked it up.     The beginning of the novel is gripping, the plot develops unpredictably. However, from the middle of the book it just deteriorates into cliches, \\"good British spies against bad communists\\". I wish the author spent time studying East German justice system, to at least get the terminology right. It's a spoiler, but at the end of the novel the German intelloigence officer walks into a prison full of political detainees, opens the door with his own keys and lets the character - detained by the communist state - out into the street, where another escapee is waiting for her...    Thhis novel is good to read in the dentist's waiting room. Top 100? No way.

It pulled me right in.   There is never a lull in this book.  It's just a beautiful story.  I would recommend to readers of all ages and of all reading interests.  Don't miss the glossary in the back of book to help those that don't understand the Indian terms throughout.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Words cannot express how exciting and entertaining this concert is. The music is incredible! 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' is simply breathtaking. A stage filled with unbelievable talent!!!  To see George's son on stage, is like looking at the past and seeing George for the first time as a young musician. Watching him playing along with the great Eric Clapton is truly beautiful. It is bittersweet, as you remember what a talented and well respected person George Harrison was. He is tuly missed and loved by millions. What an amazing tribute this concert was. What a legacy he's left his family and the world.<br />Rest In Peace and Thank You, George.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Come one... it's Star Wars.  Why not just pony up for the best possible transfers??  And go ahead and throw in the original versions for kicks (they're probably better anyways, I just can't remember since I haven't seen them in so long).  Also dissapointed to find out that they are leaving out tons of bonus materials.  Do we REALLY have to wait another few years for a better \\"Collector's Edition\\" or something to come along.  I'd rather pay more for a definative version right now than get this version and have to shell out again in a couple years to upgrade.  What a bummer.  George Lucas sucks.    If you're with me create your own 1-star review.  Lets try and bomb this product.

B0058P7KUA|4.0|Sometimes takes a while to open on G2X.  That gets -1 star, but I&apos;d only mark it down half a star if possible, because the game is absolutely wonderful.  I enjoy it more on my phone than on the PS3.

B000BF0D9M|5.0|This is a FANTASTIC CD set!  You will thorougly enjoy it as Jesse is the master! If you're new to Jesse Cook, this is a grat place to start!
B004HO6I4W|1.0|I gave this only one star. I am rating only the DVD, not the movie, and the reason I give the DVD only one star is that the DVD is not available in 3D. I don't understand why they decided not to release this in the theatrical version (3D). Poor decision on the distributors' part.
B000068QZK|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne's No Rest For The Wicked was his fifth studio album as a solo artist and was released in 1988. This was the first Ozzy album to feature Zack Wlyde who replaced Jake E Lee on guitar duties.<br /><br />Zack has a very different guitar style to either Randy's or Jake E Lee's; his playing is full of pinch harmonics, squeals and other little flourishes that make his playing different to each of Ozzy's previous guitarists, on top of that he delivers a more heavy metal style of riff more frequently and as a consequence the direction of this album changed.<br /><br />After the death of original guitarist Randy Rhodes, Ozzy started heading in a more commercial direction, but No Rest For The Wicked reverse the trend with a very rock orientated sound musically and much heavier production sound.<br /><br />No Rest For The Wicked primarily contains straight up hard and heavy numbers, with a much less commercial direction than the previous two albums and as such hasn't dated just as badly as they have. Surprisingly; give the increased heaviness of the album, it sold very well and was a large commercial and critical success.<br /><br />The album is full of strong and well written music, including the excellent `Miracle Man,' `Breaking All The Rules,' and `Crazy Babies.' The whole album is fairly consistent and the majority of the material is of that same high quality.<br /><br />If you enjoy big riffs and bold guitar solos then this is a superb album, the only real flaw you could level at it is that it may be a bit repetitive, certainly so if you don't like pinch harmonics. For everyone else, this shouldn't put you off however and I highly recommend you give the album a shot.<br /><br />Overall, No Rest For The Wicked is one of the better Ozzy albums out there, the material is strong, consistent and fairly heavy. Overall, it is a pretty essential buy for fans.
B004EPYZU8|3.0|At least the ending was ok.  The action scenes were great but here weren't enough of them as there's 3 distinct lines being carried through the movie....two pretty much kinda pooh. The fantasy action line was pretty dang good and the ending was nice.    Overall, it was a disappointment. Once you see the previews, you've seen the best parts of the movie and that just isn't a good thing.
B000068R1X|3.0|Ozzy Osbourne's third studio album Bark At The Moon was released in 1983 and was the first Ozzy album to feature Jake E Lee on guitar, after the death of original guitarist Randy Rhodes.<br /><br />Jake E Lee's has a very different guitar style to either Randy or Zack, which gives his two album's with the band a unique flavor. The album is still full of dramatic guitar solos and big riffs and should keep guitar fans very happy.<br /><br />Bark At The Moon contained some hard and heavy numbers but also saw a move in a slightly more commercial direction than the first two albums and as such hasn't dated just as well as they have. Some songs seen a tad overproduced and some feature synth sounds very much of their time.<br /><br />The album has some utterly standout music however, such as `Bark At The Moon,' and `Rock N Roll Rebel,' both of which are two of the best songs ever released under the Ozzy Osbourne name. If the whole album was as good as those two songs it would be an unquestionable five star effort. To be absolutely fair, the good to filler ratio isn't as high as it could be however, and some listeners may find it a little hit and miss.<br /><br />Legal difficulties between Ozzy and ex-members have spoiled the band's legacy for a whole generation, making some albums hard to get a hold of, impossible to hear live or reissued with heavy edits and overdubs.<br /><br />If you plan on buying Bark At The Moon you'll have a choice between the original, the 1995 cd version with the tiny cover art in a dark purple frame or the 2002 version where the music has been altered and guitar parts are missing but containing the excellent bonus track `One Up The B Side.'<br /><br />Overall, Bark At The Moon isn't the hands down greatest Ozzy album, but it is still fairly essential for fans, and definitely worth checking out for the two aforementioned tracks.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|I loved the original, still do and I own it and it gets 6 stars as it is exceptional imo.    This one was different enough and modernized to fit more in line with what I would call today's mores and guidelines. I liked it. It was different enough from the original that it was entertaining and deserved 5 stars. There was less attention to detail in the hits, but technologies were employed as a counter measure.
B004QNVQXW|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne's second studio album was released one year after his debut in 1981. Diary Of A Madman has since gone on to become a classic album and Ozzy himself has named it his favourite.<br /><br />The album is the second of only two studio albums with Randy Rhodes on board as the guitarist before his untimely death in a plane accident. As you are likely already aware, Randy's inventive style of guitar playing is legendary.<br /><br />Diary Of A Madman contains the classic tracks `Over The Mountain,' and `Flying High Again,' although the whole album is strong and of a pretty consistent quality. The album is beyond strong guitar-wise, the warm analogue production sounds fantastic and the general quality of songwriting is top class.<br /><br />This 2011 remastered edition of the album does not come with either linear notes or a DVD, nor does it contain the bonus disc found in the Legacy Edition.<br /><br />What this version does feature however, are the original performances. This is not the version where Mike Bordin and Rob Trujillo were made to overdub the original rhythm section out of the mix, but rather a new version that reinstates the original musician's work, remastered to the highest quality.<br /><br />Overall; Diary Of A Madman, the last studio effort to feature Randy on guitar, is a superb album by Ozzy Osbourne and this 2011 remastered edition is a no-frills fantastic sounding version.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Like a lot of other posters on here, I had put off reading this book for a long time!  The title was weird, the fact that it was narrated by a dog was weird, etc...but this book is WONDERFUL.  Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. What a wonderful book, I recommend to all!
B0000252YK|3.0|Ozzy Osbourne's fourth studio album The Ultimate Sin was released in 1987 and saw a move in a more commercial direction. Some people claim that this is a very poor album, but this is not really the case, it is a good album with a poor production style.<br /><br />There is still a lot of top quality heavy metal music to be found on the album, but here and there, there are some over-slick moments, the production job is very eighties-radio and the crunch and power is taken out of the guitar tone.<br /><br />The album still has some standout music, such as `Secret Loser,' `Thank God For The Bomb,' and `Never Know Why,' all of which contain the signature Ozzy sound in some form or other. If you like Jake E Lee's guitar style then you should definitely give it a try.<br /><br />Legal difficulties between Ozzy and ex-members have spoiled the band's legacy for a whole generation, making some albums hard to get a hold of, impossible to hear live or reissued with heavy edits and overdubs.<br /><br />If you plan on buying The Ultimate Sin, you'll most likely be picking up the 1995 cd version, with the tiny cover art in a frame of green. Luckily, the original full-page cover is printed on the second page of the booklet so you can just fold the page over and insert it in that way to have the proper cover.<br /><br />Overall, Ozzy has made better album's than The Ultimate Sin, but it is still worth a look for fans. It may be very dated and too commercial for some listeners but there is enough good material on there to warrant a buy.
0553801473|3.0|I read the reviews in Amazon about the latest book in the series and was pleasantly surprised to read critics that agreed with me the first 3 were great but Book 4 I found tedious and not getting anywhere. There are similar thoughts about the latest, book 5,  The characters seem to have gotten away from the author and it doesn't go anywhere.<br /><br />Hopefully Book 6 will come together and bring some conclusion when published in 5 years Frankly I think he is using his computer program to do too much of the writing with the thought of bringing in the bucks (can't fault him for that). But my time is too valuable to me at this age to waste it reading tedious stories<br /><br />Love Mom
B0051YDTKS|5.0|Ozzy Osbourne released his debut solo album in 1980 and it has since went on to become an all-time classic album in the eyes of many. It contains a lot of great material and grows on you with each listen.<br /><br />The album is one of only two studio albums with the late Randy Rhodes on board as the guitarist. Randy's guitar playing is the stuff of legends as I'm sure you've already heard if you like this kind of music.<br /><br />Blizzard Of Ozz features the classic tracks `Crazy Train,' `Suicide Solution,' and `Mr Crowley,' all of which are essential listening for any Ozzy fan. The album is also strong as a whole, with great rocking tracks like `I Don't Know,' and `No Bone Movies,' keeping the album's energy up alongside a few softer moments for variety.<br /><br />The album is strong in terms of songwriting, a masterpiece guitar-wise and Ozzy's excellent vocals have rarely sounded better. Overall, Blizzard Of Ozz is definitely a must have album for Ozzy fans.<br /><br />This 2011 expanded edition of the album does not come with linear notes or a DVD, but thankfully does feature the original performance by the original musicians remastered to the highest quality. This is not the version where Mike Bordin and Rob Trujillo were made to overdub the original rhythm section out of the mix. Furthermore, there is the bonus tracks 'RR,' and 'You Looking At Me, Looking At You,' in addition to an alternative version of the ballad 'Goodbye To Romance.'<br /><br />If you want to listen to Blizzard Of Ozz, this is a great way to do it.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I had looked forward to this latest novel of George R. R. Martin, having enjoyed the preceding books in the series. What a disappointment - frankly it was a grind to read and several times I almost gave up.<br />He is doubtless a great writer with impressive prose and active imagination. However ...<br />I found the story thread impossible to follow as it is disjoint.<br />There are endless introspections and flash backs that add little to the story.<br />He must have used the word 'jape' and 'mummer' a hundred times and I found it irritating.<br />There are far too many secondary characters that left me confused, and muddied the story line.<br />The book is far too long for what it has to say.<br />A pity.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The predictions this keyboard makes are phenomenal, and the ui and controls are easy to use and helpful. Nothing gimmicky here, you will use every feature available. While Swype might still be a bit quicker when it comes to one handed texting, SwiftKey blows it out of the water in the two handed department. I&apos;d recommend this keyboard for even the most avid Swype user, for those moments when you really just need a good classical keyboard.
030726999X|5.0|If some benevolent being were giving wishes, I'd wish for Salander to be real, and living in the apt. upstairs. The last book in this short series is bittersweet, since it's the final book published by Stieg Larsson.  Planning to re-read all 3, just because they're a fun ride with a social conscience throughout.
B001TD1XWG|4.0|I am a fan of crossover albums and this one does not fail, its great! Its a little hipster mixed with rock and its fun.
1442344989|5.0|Its just a stunning story. Honest, well read by herself ( try that sometime yourself... its very hard ).I am in tears already, and only on the first disc.
0091940737|4.0|I purchased this book after reading a favorable review that compared it to Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch -- without the angst. It's not really a feminist book but it is written by a female comedian who calls herself a feminist -- and it had me laughing out loud, especially at the joyful discussions of masturbation. It's a touching and hilarious memoir about growing up as a working-class girl in Britain in the 80s. It has lots of insights, plenty of self-deprecation, and a vivid sense of self. No feminist diagnosis but plenty of affirmation of being a woman. Highly recommended.
B00003CXBK|5.0|The first thing I  thought of this movie after I watched it was: this is spirited away mixed with My neighbor totoro, but not in a cutesy way it was more filled with action. It is like Spirited away because of well the spirits lol and it is like MNT bc of the forest god. After I watched it; I wanted to watch it again, it just has brilliant animation, compelling storyline, and great characters and character development. Anyone who loves Miyazaki's films, but prefers a more mature story such as Tales from Earthsea would really like this one.
B004EPYZP8|3.0|There's not much point in a describing the film since there's plenty of reviews here, so I'll just say I found the film seriously over rated.    Most of the actors mumbled there lines so much that we had to stop and go back and see if we could figure out what they were saying, and most of the time, we couldn't.  William Macy was a great support for McConaughey but once gone the film fell flat. With few exceptions, there was a consistent lack of emotional connection, even Marisa Tomei, whose always good seemed flat. The story might have been interesting in another, more accomplished, director's hands.  Too bad.  Much to do about nothing.
B00007LL7O|5.0|I must say that this is a spectacular album. I wasn't expecting to like it THIS MUCH! It thought it would be a good Strato album (which makes it amazing compared to modern music today). I will not say this is their best but It's close so far...This is about tied with Elysium (see my review for Elysium to get an idea of how much I like it). And one reviewer said he like \\"Timo's Wailing\\" on this album. What wailing?! He just has a higher range than any of us could ever dream of having! He's by no means wailing!    Music:    Eagleheart- I seriously love this song with a passion. It is so uplifting and it makes me wanna touch the sky. GREAT melody and I love the chorus. It's not as good as Hunting High and Low, tho because it's too short!    Soul of a Vagabond- Another favorite. The opening guitar is heavy and then it evolves into one of those slow, hypnotizing songs that you have to fight not to like...and the chorus of this is very interesting: \\"In silence, I scream, But no one listens to me, Absolution, Salvation, My sins won't leave me be, The first cry, The last breath, We are born to die...\\" A very interesting chorus indeed. I think this is a very high point in the album.    Find Your Own Voice- Great song. Fast and has a good message. I like it, but Learning to Fly is in a similar style and much, much better!    Fantasia- First of only 2 songs on the album that I don't like as much. I think it might grow on me, but for now, I think it's just an average Strato song.    Learning to Fly- GREAT MELODY, Awesome chorus, and Amazing song in general. I think this shoulda been released as a single as well.    Papillon- Great song, the chorus isn't as great as the verse but never the less, a good song.    Stratofortress- An instrumental. This is the other song I find not up to par with the rest. I like it kinda but it isn't a favorite. One of my family members said it sounds like Tom and Jerry chasing each other on mega speed!    Elements- Nothing I can say will be good enough to fully describe this song...    A Drop in the Ocean- A slow acoustic song. Good ending to a Great album.    Verdict: If you liked Infinite, then get it. If you have Elements Pt 2, then get this one. If you are a Stratovarius fan, Kamelot fan, or Power Metal fan, then BUY IT. That is all. Thank you for viewing this review. Please Exit carefully, the \\"buy\\" button is near the top of the page and the \\"This Review was Helpful\\" button is below.
B0014Z4ON4|1.0|What were Lucas and Spielberg thinking? This movie is extremely violent and contributes little to nothing to film history. I felt like I was watching two hours of violence just for violence' sake. And much of the violence and torture is directed towards children. One wonders if the makers of this film would subject their own children or teens to a viewing. I hope not.    The film also has no real story line other than a dark religious cult's need to torture and kill people, and the main character's need to retrieve a stone for a village, all while superficially romancing someone who appears not to want to be romanced. The woman's role offers little more than screaming and being ineffective, as she continuously waits to be saved by what is supposed to be a hero (but is a much darker character who is just as violent as his captors).    This is really a poor film. Although it's technically well done (regarding special effects, lighting, and props), most of the film is based on finding violent ways to hurt and test human beings. It's as though the gory, violent special effects were far more important than the story or acting.     I don't usually write a bad review but this was such a visually draining film (I felt sick at times and fast-forwarded through yet more scenes of violence) that I wanted to warn customers not to waste their money or time on this. This really is a sad statement on what passed (and passes) for acceptable movie experience in America. Definitely don't expose your children to such a violent film unless you want them to see how little regard the filmmakers had for human life, evidenced in most scenes throughout this movie. (How ironic that this came from someone who went on to make a movie about the Holocaust.)    I am truly sorry that I wasted almost two hours of my life watching this film.
1577312082|5.0|I read THE POWER OF NOW several years ago.  There are some very profound thoughts in the book.  I found listening to the CD I just purchased even more enlightening.  There were sections I listened to over and over. For anyone who tends to marinate in there past pain, this is a great book to read.
B003EYVXXW|2.0|This movie was not at all what I expected it to be. I guess with being a fan of Spartacus and other movies depicting this era, I expected more! However, if your just lounging around on a sunday with nothing else to do...why not pop it in and watch it!
B00006DEF9|5.0|\\"Singing in the Rain\\" showcases what is at least one of the very best performances of Gene Kelly's entire career--and the same goes for Jean Hagen and Donald O'Connor. Debbie Reynolds is perfect as the young girl who gets into the movie business as she and Gene Kelly's character develop romantic feelings for each other. As for the musical numbers, I couldn't take my eyes off them! These numbers must be some of the very best ever recorded on film. The movie was not filmed in widescreen but it didn't have to be-this film is all THAT good. The choreography, cinematography and overall design enhance this masterpiece and the musical score works perfectly, too.<br /><br />The film starts with an acting team from the silent era of motion pictures, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) showing up for the Hollywood premiere of \\"The Young Rascal;\\" it's yet another one of their silent films that makes the crowds gasp in awe. Their movies studio, Monumental Pictures) tells the public that they're in love for publicity; and even Lina believes it although Don knows it's not true! Don's pal and colleague, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) is also there but Don, ever the ham, takes the microphone and the spotlight and indulges in some fantasy when asked about their past in the world of entertainment. All this happens while Lina remains completely silent--and actually, she's quiet for good reason, too--her voice is actually this screeching, high pitched, nails down a chalkboard experience that is better left unheard; and so Monumental Pictures' chief R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) lets Don do all the talking at public appearances.<br /><br />Things change fast, though, when their latest film being produced, \\"The Dueling Cavalier,\\" must be changed into a \\"talkie.\\" They all bemoan Warner Brothers' success with \\"The Jazz Singer;\\" and they wonder how on Earth they'll ever get around the fact that Lina's voice is terrible to listen to even if she is beautiful. However, it's not hopeless: Don, Cosmo and Kathy Selden (a young aspiring actress) devise a plan to make \\"The Dueling Cavalier\\" into a musical which will be renamed \\"The Dancing Cavalier.\\" Moreover, they have another plan which is to dub Kathy's great voice for Lina's--but without Lina knowing it so she won't be tempted to have Kathy fired.<br /><br />Things can go pretty much in several different directions from here; and that of course is how everything eventually plays out--but I won't spoil it for you in case you don't know the rest of the plot yet! Suffice it to say that you'll be very entertained with numbers like Donald O'Connor's \\"Make `Em Laugh\\" and \\"The Broadway Melody.\\" Look also for Cyd Charisse dancing with Gene Kelly and a young Rita Moreno plays Zelda Zanders as the movie playfully pokes fun at Clara Bow, the \\"It Girl.\\"<br /><br />The two DVD set comes with wonderful bonus features. There's an optional running commentary with Debbie Reynolds and others; and the second DVD has two superlative documentaries, \\"Musicals Glorious Musicals\\" about what was called \\"The Arthur Freed Unit\\" at MGM and \\"What a Glorious Feeling\\" about the making of \\"Singing in the Rain.\\" We also get clips of musical numbers from \\"Singing in the Rain\\" as they originally appeared in previous films.<br /><br />\\"Singing in the Rain\\" is clearly one of the best musicals ever produced; it's a must-have for any fan of musicals. Even people who don't like musicals will be humming along with the music! Fans of the actors will also want this for their collections.Don, Cosmo and Kathy Selden (a young aspiring actress) devise a plan to make \\"The Dueling Cavalier\\" into a musical which will be renamed \\"The Dancing Cavalier.\\" Moreover, they have another plan which is to dub Kathy's great voice for Lina's--but without Lina knowing it so she won't be tempted to have Kathy fired.

0525421580|5.0|I love this book. I've read others by the two authors, but this really has to be my favorite book.  One of the really unique aspects of this book to me is how it handles depression. will (Will #2/Leviathan's Will) presents dialogue in a very unique way. The formatting really annoyed my friends, but to me, having experienced severe depression for most of my life, it really shows the level of depersonalization that will experiences.   I feel like the book really sounds like it's written by teenagers. The language may be a little too \\"adult\\" for young readers (I think the target age group here is 16+).  It does have LGBT themes, and if that bothers you, than this is probably not the book for you.   But it is a really wonderful book, and as an LGBT teen, I feel like it hits really close to home on both Wills' fronts.
B00065F86U|4.0|This is an expensive piece of equipment for a battery chamber.  Too bad they didn't give you an option or at least another accessory with the mb-d10 as this is a must have unless you don't mind having to using the other battery chamber that comes with the MB-D10 where you could place 8 AA's (with higher rating rechargeable batteries) to achieve 8 fps.      Other than that, its simple to attached and detach from the battery itself.  Locking and unlocking is simple too.  It does it job and that is the main thing.
B004Y1USV2|2.0|Okay, I know this is Yes 2011, but I've had this thing stuck in the CD slot of my Xterra for days and days, and I still can't say that it is a full-blown hit, or if I really can say that I like it, I want to really, but I can't help remembering all the previous awesome Yes material. and I've been a fan since 1972. Seems as if there's too many riffs I've heard before- or some new takes on how to screw with the controls, this disc does have a few good moments, it's just too few, though, and the new singer is adequate, but I really miss Andersen's phrasing. Seems to me the guy's are kinda running out of ideas these days, or maybe they are just getting old like all of us, but to me, I can see the writing on the wall, now that Andersen's gone, they're trying to reinvent themselves. I'll leave it in the CD player for now, I really want to like it, but I can't help thinking I could pop this thing in the local rest home CD player and the crowd might really groove on it.Oh well, I've at least got the new Andersen, Wakeman CD to look forward to-

0446691437|5.0|I noticed the one star reviews tend to focus on a few common themes, so I thought it might  be helpful to address some of them.<br /><br />1) This book is not scientific.  Steve Pressfield's concept of \\"resistance\\" is not psychiatric, its his conceptual framework to simplify, understand and deal with, the many \\"invisible hands\\" (my term) that always interfere with completing projects.<br /><br />2) As part of that non-scientific framework, Steve puts the issues into spiritual (not specifically religious) terms.  In order for his message to get through and take effect, you have to accept his unique spiritualism, suspend your skepticism, and just roll with it.<br /><br />3) This book is written specifically for unblocking the creative process.  Its not the standard motivational pep talk for people who wish to quit smoking, lose weight and get out of credit card debt.  So if you aren't a creative type, this may not be the best book for you.<br /><br />I'm no fan of self help books, because I find they are mostly repackaged common sense with short term motivational effects.  This book is different, Steve gives you a clear way to think about resistance and how to deal with it, long term.  In my personal experience, he hit a bulls eye, as if he wrote this specifically for me.<br /><br />If you're looking to re-motivate you don't need science, you need a kick in the pants. Steve delivers!
B004YTGRMI|4.0|Everyone else has debated the merits of this album here so I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about the artistic quality of the album except to say that this remains one of my favorite REM albums. \\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\" saw the formula of the first three albums altered alteration of the band's once murky sound in favor of clear, clean vocals and instrumentation. Producer Don Gehman ushered the band more into the mainstream with this album helping the band fashion a strong ROCK record that focused less on mysterious sonics and more on straight ahead Rock 'n' Roll.<br /><br />Interestingly, Geham (according to the liner notes) convinced Stipe to deliver lyrics with a message that fans could understand but if you listen to the demos it seems he was already headed in that direction with much clearer diction so, perhaps, the band was already headed down the less rocky path of the indie band it was and decided to swerve into the lane reserved for mainstream rock artists.<br /><br />The remaster is another matter entirely. While the detail is extremely good here on the remaster, it is compressed and loud sounding--there's no subtly (I'm not sure if there should be any but I doubt the mastertape sounds like this)to the presentation or the soundtstage on this remastered 25th Anniversary Edition. It suffers from many of the sins that have dogged other remasters including REM's recent deluxe reissues. My advice--hold on to whatever version of this sounds best to you because I doubt sincerely you're going to love this unless you're listening on earbuds from an iPod or mp3 player (or small computer speakers). You can then decide which one you like best.  Clearly that's what this remaster was designed for.  I suspect the decision to go with the compressed version here came from REM themselves. That said, the EQ choices for the mastering aren't quite as harsh as many remasters and there is a bit of dynamic range although peak limited appears to be used.<br /><br />The real reason most fans are going to buy this set isn't because of the deluxe packaging--the booklet which is a measeley 12 pages doesn't provide quite the immersively experience for most boxed sets. The postcards are nice although hardly essential and the same can be said for the poster (most fans are of an age where a poster really wouldn't be high on their reasons to buy this)--it's because of the disc of demos. I do wish that Capitol/IRS/EMI had gone for a THREE disc set with a live disc from one of their better shows on the tour here in addition to the original album AND the demos disc.<br /><br />The demos disc features 19 songs including some material that didn't make the final album (and some tracks that have never appeared in finished form anywhere). The material that appears here but didn't make the final album includes \\"Two Steps Onward\\", \\"Out of Tune\\", \\"Wait\\", \\"All The Right Friends\\" and \\"March Song\\" (which became \\"King of Birds\\"). There are also VERY rough drafts of some songs including \\"I Believe\\" where Michael Stipe just hums the melody of the unfinished song that are fascinating as it's like listening to the creation of the songs themselves and being allowed to hear avenues the band elected NOT to turn down for certain songs.<br /><br />My only major issue is with the mastering of the album (and the demos disc); people who are going to buy the CD are buying it NOT because they want to hear it louder but because they want to hear the best possible sounding version of the album on CD possible. Those who want the compressed, louder version will, no doubt, download it.<br /><br />I am disappointed that we keep going in this direction with remasters. If you want to hear this album the way it SHOULD have sounded my advice is to not purchase the CD but buy the vinyl (if you have a turn table)as Mobile Fidelity mastered the vinyl version (just go to their website and see about ordering it)and that, at least, promises a good sounding version of this album.<br /><br />Recommended but only for the second disc of demos NOT the mastering of the main album.<br /><br />5 stars for the album itself (and the second disc of demos)<br />3 stars for the masteringhe mastering of the main album.    5 stars for the album itself (and the second disc of demos)  3 stars for the mastering
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|This product was not new as advertised. The front cover had a bunch of indentations on it and plastic pieces were broken so the case wouldn't even close. Also missing carboard case w/ Batman on the bike which it would have if product was really new.

0882709194|1.0|I purchased this book unaware that the 'special introduction' was written by a fruit loop creationist. Now i understand why it is the cheapest of all the Origin of Species collection. I particlarly love Comfort's analogy of the plane and the parachute. The fear of jumping out a plane justifies why we should fear god also, but thats okay, because god offers us a parachute. I actually laughed out loud on a busy train when i read this. But he doesnt stop there, he extends his rants to other religions, criticizing them on the same merits that makes his very own religion just as ridiculous. Your on another level of ignorance....    I am still reading the body of text which is the words of Darwin (hopefully unedited by this amazing ignoramous that is Ray Comfort).     Do yourself a favour if you buy this book, rip out the intro and use it to clean your ass. Creationists, if people like Ray Comfort are your spokesman, you are loosing the battle.

Although a good album I much prefer \\"Head Music\\".  Again they have all the B-Sides and a \\"remastered\\" version is not for me, but the extra bonus songs are great and you don't have to purchase the two versions of the single.  As most know each single has two versions and has at least 2-3 extra songs along with the tune.  In essence you get 4-5 bonus tracks with each hit record.  Good times all around.
0345529057|5.0|This is one of the greatest book series that I have ever read, on par with all of the Shannara Series.
0345529057|5.0|Box came opened but it's natural since customs in Mexico probably opened it to check it but the books and the box came in perfect condition but one that is a bit chipped from a corner, anyway I have enjoyed the books so far, great purchase even if it took too long to arrive :)
0375836675|4.0|The Messenger is Markus Zusak's 4th novel. The story revolves around Ed Kennedy, an under-age taxi driver in a small town somewhere in rural Australia. Ed's life seems pretty ordinary: he lives in a suburban shack, shares coffee with his smelly dog, The Doorman, and plays cards with friends Marv, Ritchie and Audrey (with whom he's in love). Things start to change when he inadvertently stops a bank robbery: the first ace, the ace of diamonds turns up in his letterbox, and it appears he has been chosen to affect the lives of certain others. But who is sending the aces? Who has chosen him to be the messenger?   Zusak captures the feel of small town Australia very well, probably from his own experience. The story is a bit slow-moving in parts (just like small-town life). Zusak gives us characters to like, love and hate, dialogue that is authentic, some humour and an intriguing plot. Without giving anything away, some readers may be disappointed in the ending, but the last few pages bear rereading and contemplation. At first I felt a bit cheated, like I did after reading Ian McEwan's Atonement, but I found it easier to read than that novel and, on reflection, I liked the ending. It is certainly not a children's book, even though it was the winner of the 2003 Children's Book Council Book of the Year Award!
