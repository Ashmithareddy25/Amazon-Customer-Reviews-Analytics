0307743659|5.0|I love this story!  It is such a grea haunted house scare!  This is a book I can enjoy over and over!  :)
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Spaghetti western with a lot of gore.  It was so different than anything I have seen in a while!  I liked it!
B000ECX0QU|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock is my all time favorite and no one will ever top him!  Another great sitting on the edge of your seat from the master!  :)
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|First two books are better than the last.  Enjoyed the read. War everyone loses so in the end I guess prim had to die. Poor finish to good story.
B000TJBNFI|5.0|I love the book and the movie!  I am so happy I made this purchase1  Great cast that give a great performance!  :)
B00E9Q6H1C|5.0|What a great film. It's one I can watch over and over. I showed it to my kids and they love it as well. Why it's rated R I have no idea, it's completely appropriate for preteen and older
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it challenges me.Once you learn how to look for the clues its alot of fun. Want more games like this.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love the music from this musical - saw it on Broadway and had to have the cd - enjoy it so much - busy learning all the words so I can sing along!
B00BIPMGD0|1.0|If you like well written and entertaining, but morally bankrupt and anti christian tv, then this is,the show for you.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Just started getting into Dr. Who after a friend recommended it to me. I've only gotten through season one, but so far, I love it! The other seasons are sure to follow season 1 into my library. Frequently funny, frequently serious or sad, often spooky, sometimes campy--but in a surprisingly endearing way--and always creative, I would absolutely recommend Dr. Who to anyone who enjoys sci-fi.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great great game. continues fun over and over.  never want to stop playing. but have to sleep some time.  would highly recommend
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This could be the best comical racing game ever. I and my kids love it. It has the typical in-app purchases that so many annoying apps bug you with these days, but it's still loads of fun at the base level.
B0049J2BSM|4.0|My three year old thought it was too scary in some parts so we just muted those spots. It actually started a good conversation about monsters not being real.
B0086700CM|1.0|I don't see how people like this game. It's quite dumb and boring after about 10 minutes. Even old car racing games like Pole Position are better.
B00ABXA1HI|2.0|Great app when used on home network. Having to pay for remote access? No thank you. If you intend to remote in to a home computer while being in your own home, this app is for you. For true remote service, look else where, as this app requires a fee.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book keeps you guessing until the very end. The characters are great and you end up really feeling for them. Good story and although it's pretty dark, it's not nightmarish.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A Terrific story about people who live inside of a silo to save themselves from a poisonous world outside.  Written as five novellas the story moves along quickly.  I devoured it in only two days, staying up far too late to read just one more chapter.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Love love this book. It was so heartwarming. A little predictable but I loved it anyway.  Read it in 2 days
B00EI6E17A|1.0|Disappointed.  Her last few songs have been major misses for me.  I think I'm done with Gaga.  I wanted to be excited about this, but I'm just not.  It's hard to articulate.  The song leaves me cold.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Great games.....easy to pick up can't put it down.<br />Very interesting......love the different symbols.<br />It's great and its lots of fun.q<br /><br />Joe p
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We allow my six year old to watch one at a time when he finishes the book for it.  He has read and watched books 1 and 2 and loved them both!  He is almost done with the third and surprisingly is not begging to see the movie.  He is now more interested in the books!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I am thrilled that Shania Twain us back to performing.  Her songs hold special meanings for me as I used this album for pure joy when I was traveling to see my elderly Mother!!!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|After a long break between series the BBC brought back the longest running Sci Fi series in television history. More modern feel but still true to it's past. Great acting that only got better as the season progressed.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|I love this movie but I wouldlike it has subtitles in Spanish, specially for some members of my family who do not know any English, but it is a good purchase...
B00DP3IESY|4.0|the tech is really cool and the story was engaging.  It's derivative but still a well told and well acted story.  The drones are the best part. I want a guard drone.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is perfect for me, I have tinnitus and have noise in my head 24/7 and it's difficult to sleep. This app gives me so many choices for ambient sound that helps to mask the noise. I recommend it for anyone who needs this type of sound app.
B00821OX98|4.0|I only chose this series because my husband really enjoys SyFy ... but it was better than I thought. The aliens weren't cheesy and the characters were believable (not 100% credible, but believable for TV characters). I rolled my eyes a few times because this definitely isn't high brow drama worthy of PBS .... but everyone has a story as they band together and try to fend off the aliens who have taken over earth for reasons unknown to them. If you'd enjoy imagining what it would be like if our world fell into chaos (more than it is already), you'll enjoy this. I found the aliens to be truly scary, so I don't think this is for very young viewers - maybe 10 and up? Having Spielberg as a producer doesn't hurt this one bit.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|They don't make movies like this anymore.  Most modern movies are noisy , violent, poorly written stories with overdone special effects.  What I like about this movie is that it derives it enduring charm through great story telling.<br /><br />The movie also reflects the period of time when the world was threatened by by a ruthless fascist nation ( nazi germany) and the struggle of a few people to stand up to the Nazis.  Think of what the world could have been like if the Nazis prevailed.  This movie captures the anxiety of this era .  Notwithstanding this movie is a classic love story set in war.  It is one of my favorites.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Hard enough to be interesting but not impossible.  Plenty of levels and little quirks.  Got to live the little green dude.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed even after several viewings.  A classic Sci- fi show which endures generation after generation .<br />It is even better with modern special effects.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Just what I ordered.  This CD was a gift for the wife.  The packaging was just right considering there were three CD's in the package.
B00CWVF2GC|3.0|There's a lot to like in this quality film. There's a good good deal of honesty here I can relate to; much delivered in subtext. I found the pace a bit too slow and the outcomes slightly too convenient and an ultimately unsatisfying and slightly puzzling ending.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Just what I ordered.  This CD was a gift for the wife.  Packaging was just right considering there were three CD's in the package.
B0034G4P80|5.0|you have to turn your mind off for this and its great fun - helps if you know the tales of ragnarok (the Norse myth rather than the game!)
B007REV4T8|5.0|Another good and exciting James Bond Movie.  Just what I expected even though I saw it on the big screen.  Packaging was just right for this DVD.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Love it!!! This app really makes the brain think. This game is addictive. I could play this game all day long.
B00BPA7U34|5.0|Just what I ordered .  This CD was a gift for the wife.  Packaging was just right considering there were three CD's in the package.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|... what great sound! My Grado SR80is sounded harsh and brittle when used in conjunction with my iPhone until grabbing this bad boy. The sound is now rich, full, and defined. In fact, with 3 EQ presets to choose from, it's improved the sound in my Grados, some previously muddy AKGs, and even the white earbuds that came with the phone in the first place. This is a GREAT value.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|It was quite a different DVD than I viewed before.  It kept you right on the edge of your seat.  Packaging was just right for this DVD.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|One of the most boring books I have ever read. Couldn't get into at any point. It was a letdown
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I bought this for my grandson he likes it. He just went to Disneyland and so he loves Woody. I had fun watching it with him.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game. Loved the graphics. And quite challenging. I can't wait for the next one. I have played it a few times.
B0013UIUBC|5.0|I haven't had a chance to watch this movie yet but my older girls have and they loved it a lot
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Thoroughly Enjoyed reading this book.  Definetly a page turner and easy to read. Look forward to another book by this same author.
B002ZG9968|5.0|I liked the movie. It was fun watching this with my girls and being together. I do recommend this movie
B005LAII4E|5.0|Movie was package very well when i got the movie it was like brand new over all was a great movie will buy again and again
0061733199|5.0|I own this. I trust this. I bought several copies and gave them to loved ones as gifts. Carry on.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|:)<br /><br />I just wish the things that could be bought with bananas weren't crazy amounts and we had mire options.
B003NS1JHY|5.0|It's been a long time since I've seen this movie. My 11 yr old wanted to see it and it brought back memories on dumb but funny this movie was. Had to by it and knew my favorite place to purchase things ( Amazon ) would have it.  Thanks
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is so much fun!<br />You get to feed your horse groom it and all that fun stuff I woulg recommend it to you.
B00E8B1358|1.0|This was one of the worst movies ever made. When is bruce willis going to retire? If he watched this movie he would never want to act again.
B00821OX98|5.0|Awesome show! Very well written and acted. acted . This is a must see. One of my favorite shows on TV today.
B0011MZOEI|4.0|It's one more predictable film that is just fun to watch because of all the special effects.Though the plot is hardly original, it's fun to watch especially when you just want to see a fun movie!
B000I186FW|5.0|So....  I'm happy with this DVD of course.  Good addition to the Library.  If you liked the movie and you like to have the hard copy, then go for it. simple decision.
B0012NO4WO|5.0|I really love movies that are just fun to watch. The movie is filled with amazing special effects! Everyone I talk to who has  seen this film, loves it! I've never met anyone who hasn't  completely enjoyed it. How could any Keanu Reeves fan not rewatch it over and over again?
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a great t.v. show, I got my friends hooked to it. I hope alicia and will get together.
B001FVD65O|4.0|Even though the plot is similar many of his action  movies, they are fun to watch because it is easy to guess the ending. however it's  like riding a roller coaster; the excitement never goes away!
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|one of his fears was being in public and being swept into trouble, this movie is a perfect example of that, cold war stuff, I actually miss the cold war!
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Slow uninspired The only really good performance turned in by Morgan Freeman. Incredibly average on the scale of battlefield earth just mercifully not as long.
B0053O89WY|4.0|I got this as a gift and it was offered at a great price for the entire season.  The receiver of course loves this series and was so excited to receive it.
B004Z7AHZC|2.0|If I  didn't have kids, my review would be higher because it is a well made movie but I  had to turn it off because of the  message it was sending to my kids. Lie, deceive  and manipulate your parents.  Dog  days was better.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This was a great price for this gift.  I was really excited to see the receivers face as they opened it up.  They love this series and I love the price I got for it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book had me crying, laughing and thanking my lucky stars for good health. This book is definitely a must read!
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book was really good. It starts off slow, but after you get used to the names and the story starts up you won't be able to put it down.
B00CFOXBX2|5.0|very interesting movie about the unwanted side effects of a new antidepressant. shows different points of view from psychologists and patients.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|It is a great headphone/microphone set. The sound quality is more than I expected. I do not use it for gaming, yet. Who knows. :)
B006RXSBS2|5.0|ordered over the kindle as a bought movie to watch. really enjoyed it. interesting views of the old times in NY
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game. It is really addicting and I like the way it challenges my mind. I can't wait to see the different puzzles and to see how fast I can solve them.
B00BJS7104|5.0|Tarantino in my opinion is an amazing director. has some of the best movies. and this one does not disappoint!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Overall this book was good through about the first half.  Then I just started getting mad at the guy! He is really this stupid? I loved the twists and turns but the ending totally SUCKED! There is no way it should have ended the way that it did, the author should have been more creative!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|it was hard to get into at the beginning. i have a hard time staying focused with movies that start slow. i didn't finish watching it.
B00DYCBH4O|4.0|Truly enjoyed this book, I couldn't put it down and when I had to I kept thinking of it lol!
B001F4UHEE|5.0|Kevin Spacey plays a great role as the main character in this movie. has a twist ending. Thora Birch plays a teenager going through teenage angst. interesting movie
B00CL68NOG|4.0|This was quite a cute movie. It definitely had its haha moments but at the same time had a much deeper, poignant thread weaved into the fiber of this comedy.  I would even watch it again.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|would highly recommend this movie.  have watched it several times. very interesting. Denzel plays a great role like always haha
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|Well, folks, I cannot tell you what I thought of this film--I am unable to watch it. Apparently this is a new wrinkle in the production of the modern DVD, specifically Blu-ray versions.  First you have to have updated firmware for your player, then you have to make sure that in fact the source for your DVD is legitimate, and last of all you must give up all chance of getting a true answer from anybody regarding this problem. Ultimately, everyone will pass the buck and the consumer will NOT watch the film. :-(<br />My Panasonic gives me a copyright violation error message for every source for Life of Pi that I have tried: Netflix (twice) and Amazon. Haven't tried a local rental place because *surprise* there aren't any. They're all closed.  Could try our Library, but they don't really have much in Blu-ray.<br />I will update this 'review' when somebody tells me why Life of Pi will NOT play on my player when every other Blu-ray disc I've rented or own plays perfectly.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|i have bought this book for myself and for many other friends. it is kind of a self help book dedicated to the four agreements you have to have with yourself to have peace.
B001XVD21Y|5.0|With all the great actors and so much action, I was not sure at times who was the bad guys and who were the good. Seem like a long movie too. but I enjoyed it!
B0073LWEXK|2.0|couldn't get past the first few levels without going back and forth throughout the boards and was not very entertained with the graphics or the story line
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|the blurb on the back, made it sound really interesting.  we fell asleep, before the ending.  It was pretty slow and kind of good but just didn't ever get interesting.
B005IQZB14|5.0|one of the first books i bought on my kindle. i really enjoyed it. have hiked the pacific coast trail in oregon before and enjoyed reading the story.
B00BNWWVFG|3.0|I just saw this over the weekend and can barely remember it.  I can never remember the name of it.  Slowwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  Very, very slow.  The waifish actress who plays the wife/main character is good and very waifish.  The weird kissing scene between the two actresses is very uncomfortable and very unreal seeming.  It was kind of OK, and my boyfriend said it was slow, and he could barely stay awake.
B0017I91LI|5.0|would highly recommend. watched it a long time ago and then watched it again recently and parts i didn't remember... it was a really good movie.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This is a good read.I think everybody would get a different message from the book depending what age in life they are.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I read this book this summer since my daughter was having to do a summer project on the book - in case she needed some input.  I originally read it a lifetime ago in school but had absolutely no recollection of it.  It was a bit difficult in the beginning but became easier to read the further I got.  (except for the Joseph character - I rarely understood anything he said)  Although some of the characters were highly unlikable I enjoyed the book as it had many twists.  No, my daughter has not hit me up for help (yet) but I'm glad I read it again anyway. :)
B0041OT9W6|3.0|Anne Frank had very good writing skills, but it was quite boring. I understand that it shouldn't be that exciting because they were all just cooped up in the annex the whole time, but it wouldn't be my favorite book. There wasn't enough excitement.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed this one as much as the first in the series.  Can't wait for the movie although the books are usually better.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is definitely worth every penny you throw at it. But i will say that that game has irregular updates compared to say iphone or ipod versions
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read this book quite some time before the movie came out.  I initially wasn't sure that I wanted to read it as I usually don't go for this type of story.  I'm so glad I read it!  I completely enjoyed the book.  The characters are fascinating.  I went on to read the other two books as well.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|This is the second of 3 - I have not seen the third Before Midnight yet but loved the first 2.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Lots of action, great computer graphics, even a little bit of love. Definitely a must see movie for any Marvel or action movie fan.
B005K17RU0|2.0|It gives the information, but not without ever-present, annoying, movement-dominated ads that are &#34;in your face&#34;; I find the Weather Channel far easier to use and without the annoying intrusions of ads.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci is one of the human race we could love to emulate and let our nation believe that we are still a nation of the We the people...
B009WUAK2M|4.0|The Expendables 2 is just what you expect, fights, shooting, bombs and the hero's save the day at the end. It is a good movie, not great but enjoyable to watch.
0399255370|5.0|My daughter and I saw this in a store and browsed through it quickly, thinking it was very cleverly written. We didn't buy it at the time, but later when her 8 year old niece and 5 year old nephew were coming to visit, I sent her a copy to share and enjoy with them-and then to take in to school for her classroom, as she is a first grade teacher. The humor in the book is a bit sophisticated, but we agreed that by later in the year, many of the first graders would 'get' it-and the book is very appealing to kids because of the story and the colorful illustrations, and most enjoyable for the adult sharing it with a child!
0307950654|4.0|The book starts six years after Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice ends.  It is how Ms. James imagines events might have transpired.  Of course, Austin's purists will find something to criticize but you can't expect a modern author to write exactly like Austin.  James'storyline is very compatible with the original book.  My only criticism is that the accused's character is made better than it was in the original story.  I doubt he would have improved over the six years.  Overall, good job P. D. James.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Matthew McConaughey is a great actor. I was not expecting tho role for him. Good movie... corrupt laywers scare me but it was a good movie.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|I rented this to watch with my boyfriend on a date-night for us. Basically it's just a guy and his family wandering around their house in the dark. Seriously, it was so ridiculous we couldn't hardly sit through it. What Was That?! It's just your wife wondering why you're still up at 3 am watching home movies in the dark. I would Not recommend!
B005OYKI1I|3.0|The story line to be honest is kind of repetitive but it is still exciting! I like fast cars and the fact that they are passionate about them.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|You may want to preview if you have very small children, which we do. We watched it with them and we all loved it. It wasn't very violent, but still great storytelling. I believe in one scene the giant was going to eat one of the characters by rolling him up in dough and cooking him, but he escapes. Something we could watch a few times without getting bored! Definitely would recommend!
B000J2BRQU|4.0|The story line to be honest is kind of repetitive but it is still exciting! I like fast cars and the fact that they are passionate about them.
B0076DELIG|5.0|All the Bosch stories are great.  The author needs to bring Harry's daughter into law enforcement as a rookie and give her a bigger roll in his next book.
B0018OFN2W|4.0|The story line to be honest is kind of repetitive but it is still exciting! I like fast cars and the fact that they are passionate about them.
B003MC5N28|5.0|i had to read this book for school and loved it can't wait to read the next book highly recommend
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|I love the MP3 on Amazon. It is so easy! Paramore is one of my favorite bands Haley is an awesome front man.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Living in the Adirondacks we don't have access to the current weather unless we watched the morning or evening news locally.  Now we get the weather when we need it.
B002LANLDK|4.0|The story line to be honest is kind of repetitive but it is still exciting! I like fast cars and the fact that they are passionate about them.
B009EBLCK8|4.0|I really enjoyed both seasons of Sherlock. I hope the next season has more episodes, 3 doesn't cut it...too long between seasons.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|I am glad they made this movie because I feel like they are tapping into the mind of a male in an honest way
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I love to read about obstacles people face and conquer.  This was a great story about a women's stay in a Federal Prison.  How she learned something about herself and others. Loved it.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Joss Whedon Did an amazing job with this space western. It has some of the best written dialog and a great cast that keep you engaged in the story throughout!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My friend watched the PBS series every Sunday evening and came to work every Monday morning and would talk about it and after two seasons I finally broke down and started watching it when I got my Prime Membership with Amazon.  And did I get addicted!  Then I got my Sister and several friends addicted, then my Niece and her Best Friend, now my Stepdaughter.  I think that is a good way of describing how good this series is.  Ages 30 to Mid 6O's.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Dealing with the slave trade automatically signals that its likely to be gritty and it is. However comic relief is present and Jaime Foxx is really good. Great flick very much in the same vain as Pulp Fiction. Just remember Tarentino likes to make you uncomfortable, in a good way.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hours and hours of fun my eight year old grand daughter can't put it down..Need no help from me to get started..
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I like the options for the tiles types and the different types of patterns to play.  It is easy to play
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It actually charges your phone in the car. Have yet to find another with the proper amperage to do so.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Finding it really easy to play and you build your Monkey's Stats the way you want there are a total of 50 fights, but you can build your character different each time.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game for kids or adults.. date of birth is entered so the game can be easy or hard depending on age level. Looks great and not cheap like some do. Takes a little bit to load but will provide many hours of entertainment in the future I'm sure! Oh, and it's FREE!!
1451695195|1.0|Found this very difficult reading, could only get half way through. Not at all what I expected. Maybe if I was a doctor, it would have helped.
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|I LOVE karuro - been hooked on it for a while, so I was really excited to find this app. Overall, it's great. You can do the pencil markings, and it'll make the main number red if your solution doesn't add up.<br />I have 3 complaints overall. First, I constantly am hitting the wrong number (which I believe costs you points in this game) because the numbers are not spaced very well. Second the zoom feature is almost pointless as it doesn't allow you to zoom in very far so I imagine that would be a pain on smaller devices. I can completely live with both of these, and if that wre my only complaint I'd probably still give it 4.5 stars... definitely at least 4 since Amazon doesn't allow halves.<br /><br />My third and biggest complaint is the battery killer. I like to play this before going to bed as it just clears my mind and helps me fall asleep faster. If I don't kill the app when I'm done playing, then it will completely drain my battery overnight and kill my phone, even on a full charge! It also gets extremely hot... I woke up one morning and touched my phone, which was almost too hot to touch and the only thing running was this app. I cannot figure out why on earth anything would need to be constantly running or processing or whatever is going on for this to happen. I play lots of action and animated games for long periods of time without killing my battery near as fast.<br /><br />I really hope there is an update VERY soon that will address the battery murderer.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|This was an entertaining movie, nothing spectacular but I figured that going into this. The 3D is ok (I have active 3D) I have seen much better, and also way worse. I think they did a decent job with the story, it was an interesting spin on a classic story. I probably would not recommend this for kids under 12.
0679746323|4.0|This is a powerful story about a power-hungry psychopath who ultimately ruled China.  I think it should be required reading for American children.
1400023343|4.0|This is a easy to read, but its very basic. I was hoping for more tips, but it does help lay the groundwork.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|David Tennant is a fine actor. The proof of the pudding is that in this fine mystery he does not come off at all like his incarnation of tenth Doctor Who. Here he plays a troubled, driven detective somewhat out of his element in a small British seaside town<br /><br />Olivia Coleman, his foil in this mystery is also troubled, though as a longtime resident she's the insider to Tennant's outsider.<br /><br />While this mystery could be pedestrian, the fine writing and acting have raised it above the competition. I'm looking forward to the next installment!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I was really excited when I heard Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon were filming a movie in my state.  I couldn't wait to watch it.  I finally got to watch it the other day and it turned out to be a great movie.  I guess it was a little different for me because of where it was filmed so it was a little strange to see those places in a movie.  Now, Matthew McConaughey has a natural accent so he didn't have to change too much for the movie.  It made it seem more natural anyways.  But the two boys in this movie had a thick accent that even I couldn't understand and I have lived here all my life.  Even though I am sure that there are thousands of movies just like this, and this was not a high budget film, it seemed unique.  I enjoyed it just as much as some of McConaughey's other movies.  Reese played a role that I wasn't too keen on.
0399159347|5.0|This was the perfect read for me. I enjoyed it much more than expected! I'll definitely read something else from the author after this...
B00915G6NK|5.0|Ncis: Los Angeles Is the Best Tv Show On Ever!  The Action and Chase Scenes are amazing  and WOW I love it<br /><br />CALLEN AND SAM CAN ARREST ME ANY TIME
1419705849|5.0|What did boys do before Greg?  My son loves these books and I think Jeff Kinney is just great.  He created Pop Tropica and it is clear who his literary favorites are.  I love that you can pre-order these books and get them at a guaranteed great price.  Diary of a Wimpy Kid books are read and re-read and worth it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I have never been so into a book before I have read the whole harry potter series and lemony snicket novels and decided to try something more adult.  This series is exactly what I was looking for I love it
0385751532|5.0|I bought this for my son to read, and I read it, and my husband read it.  It was frustrating about the boy being so daft about his surroundings, it seemed he wasn't too intelligent.  However it has a powerful ending and was a good read.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|toughly, enjoyable, at times very' tongue in cheek'.looking forward to his next book.<br /><br />I would recommend this book especially those who have or had worked with academics.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My daughter is 8 and assembled this herself.  She loves the Lego Friends line and I think they are fabulous.  They put a lot of thought into these with the details and it has paid off.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It would get 5stars if I could see my subscriptions full vid library... it only does recent uploads but is still great for searches and has a nice tool setup.
0545265355|5.0|It took a while to get into the first one, but once you get going you can't stop.  My son read these and loved them too, so we bought the boxed set.  Very happy with it and will be a re-read in the future.  If you love this, her series Gregor the Overlander is very very good too.
B005UG542S|4.0|I am a Harry Potter fan.  It wasn't my favorite of the movie but I enjoyed it. Of course when you are a fan it is just fun to watch.
B001F5M9MG|5.0|My kids fell in love with Duck Dynasty and had to have the song, and Amazon had the album on sale, and it couldn't be beat.  I love buying MP3's on Amazon, cheaper than itunes and just as easy to download.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I've tried the Fast Diet now for three weeks and found it to be doable.  Especially because I do not have to deny myself certain foods on my 'feed' days or feel bad that I enjoy eating.  I veiw this type of diet as a way to wean myself from large meals and to learn how not to eat all day.  It has also helped me to be more selective of foods on my 'feed' days (I don't want to lose what I've lost).  It is great knowning that I am not dieting 'all' day every day.  I now look forward to my 'fast' days as a 'day off' from eating less and healthier foods.  I even believe my stomach is shrinking too.  I've done the abstainence diet before and, even though I lost weight, I was always reminded that I was a bad person if I messed up.  That type of diet was hard to return to.  Must of us have done spirtitual fasts, which sometimes lasted for several days.  So the concept of fasting is not new. I learned to incorporate the fast of 500 calories in my life twice a week and the rest of the week is guilt free.  The book's methodolgy is simple -- nothing heady and a quick read.  My only thing is that I wished the testimonials in the book were helpful in explaining how they managed the diet on their tough days -- it is never that simple -- or is it?
0547391005|5.0|Curious George.  Need I say more.  My kids loved this book when they were little, and I purchased it for a friend for her son.  Great to have all the stories in hardcover, and the pictures are beautiful and print is good.  I think this should be a book in every parents house, and it is worth the money.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I purchased EG over a year and a half ago and the only reason I read it know is its coming out as a movie, thank GOD!<br />May I never be so foolish again. While I was afraid of a childish book, Ender's Game was anything but. Having finished reading it over a week ago I have yet to finish absorbing the morals of an extremely well written book.<br />Thank you Mr. Card.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Overall I have to say that I am very pleased with product, even though it works consistenly only with Android tablet and phone and not the laptop. Other issue is the Netflix app for my Droid Bionic phone and Samsung galaxy tab 2 does not have the ability to cast yet, they say it will be corrected soon. So my experience is only based on using Youtube.<br /><br />The installation was supposed to be easy but it took me three tries, there is not much help in the google site either. Ensure both Chromecast dongle and the Laptop/Hone/Tablet are on the same wifi and this can make installation smooth.<br /><br />Once connected, watching Youtube video's is a breeze, all you need to do is download the chromecast app to the phone/tablet and this will ensure that youtube app will have a button to cast the video. So basically select the video on phone/tab then press the cast icon, then you can start watching the video on the TV. After this you are basically free to use the phone/tablet to whatever you want...you can even shut the app down the video continues to play. The phone is basically used to pause/play. The quality and the speed of the streaming is pretty good. Will recommend this product for the price.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like this game. I don't like that they make you use so many words. that is stupid. a a
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the best of the Solitaire apps. Quick response to taps is appreciated. I don't use the &quot;game center&quot; but like to complete against myself so I like the stats.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|My mom lets us play this to keep car ride smooth and I say its very cool game. My sister and I take turns.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|My grandaughter had this and I saw it twice.  About 2 months ago it was on tv, so I watched it again, then I ordered it.  Very cute movie, good songs and dance.
B008JFUO4U|2.0|DISAPPOINTING AT BEST. PERSONAL OPINION, OF COURSE. Doesn't take 20 words to relay sadness and disappointm<br />ent.  not real big on action coulda been much better.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Could be the best free game out there!  We fight over who gets to play next! Highly recommended game!  Highly addictive, play at your own risk!!!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I have been watching this show since the 2nd season. So being able to see season 1 to really understand SAMCRO is great. Mostly I love watching Jax. What a cutie!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Had me on the edge of my seat until the very end. So many dilemmas to ponder. Great character development.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|I was expecting it to be cheesy. It is fun to make fun of; and great for people who love the movie
B008XKSW7M|5.0|A delightful lighthearted comedy.  Lots of laughs and a few touching moments as well.  Recommended for young adults, and for old folks like me who enjoy remembering those days.
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|I would like it but it dosen't work, it is scratch up. I need you to replace it. thank you
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|Not only was the movie a monstrous success (go see it if you haven't) but the music absolutely sweeps you off of your feet while selling the story! From roaring epics to tender, thoughtful pieces, this collection of music is a swift ride through the Superman universe from start to finish. A must buy!
B000641D2Y|4.0|I bought this movie for my grandson who is 8 yrs old, he likes. It might have  have a little to much violences.
0425263924|5.0|awesome, enjoyed it very very much. I could not put it down. I wanted it to keep going and going.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I'm surprised how fun and interesting this game is I love it I just think that the difficulty should be a little harder so players could have more of a challenge but this game is awesome
B00CS74W0C|5.0|awesome, enjoyed it very very much. I could not put it down. I wanted it to keep going and going.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is, by far, my favorite author.  When he died, the world lost a real treasure.  I was looking forward to reading many more of his novels, but alas, it's not be.
0812986180|1.0|This was not a great book.  It really didn't tell alot about her time in prison.I don't feel like there was really any character growth in the book.  She was a victim of a rough girlfriend & a victim of the system.  There is only one small inkling in the book that she acknowledges her role in drug trafficking and how it affected other people.  The main points of the book seems to be that she is white with blonde hair and blue eyes  and that she is amazingly well liked with no problems in prison.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Pretty good movie. Not what I expected. I would recommend this movie to others. It was definitely worth the price I paid.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|To me, a great horror movie is one that can scare you, (not necessarily by grossing you out, but actually scaring you), and all 5 times I've seen this movie in the theaters, there are parts that made me jump EVERY time and I knew they were coming. Can't wait til this is released.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian painted a vivid picture of a small town girl going back to her roots to sort her past and earn her future…
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|This apps give more or less the same user surface for Gmail as I have when accessing GMail Webmail with the Inbox with different folders.<br />I think the Apps is better and easier to use than the mail client included in the OS on my Kindle Fire.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its much better than temple run or subway surfer no game could ever beat this unless they make a more modified version of it
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Fast shipping and works very well at charging the iPhone and iPad mini.  Having a second port to charge other devices is also a plus.  The price is also very good.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Not bad for 2 hours of entertainment, but it's not great either. Pretty run of the mill sci-fi action film.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Story was extremely slow reading until about the last quarter of the book, then it did pick up.  Story line was quite disturbing to think people could actually have thought patterns as the characters did.  I read a few reviews where readers did not like the ending, for me the ending was great, made me think &#34;Oh My Gosh&#34;!  It did make me think that there are people in this society that do live their lives with such conniving.
B00DGR8WSQ|5.0|You've either seen McGyver or you haven't.  If you haven't, watch at least one episode.  The series is iconic American television at it's best.<br /><br />The streaming audio and video quality were excellent.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|like comedy? like Music? like tallented actors acting crazy? then You'll lose this! I love it so much, i can't wait for more!
B005ZB91KY|5.0|It seems Captain America has not been feeling a lot of love until this movie came out.  A classic hero, and a reminder it's the quality of person that makes someone Super.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I enjoy the fast pace of the game and trying to bear my friends. I have this on my phone and on my computer plus my kindle.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Duhigg explains the mechanisms behind numerous habits that we as humans can develop, and considers their impact not only on us as individuals, but also in society and as a driving force behind marketing campaigns and business strategies. Very interesting and thought-provoking!
1423113462|5.0|This book was very exciting to me an I could not put the book down. Rick Riordan is an excellent writer.  I have read most of his books to include the Fable Haven Series.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This is a great app. I really like that you can stream just by an ip address. I got it free from amazons free app of the day.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I really like this CD. It contains several great songs all performed very well. Buy it if you like Neil Young.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book really made me think what people with disabilities go through on a daily basis. We sometimes forget that they feel deeply, too.
B00000K2W1|5.0|Brings back old memories. I almost bumped into Janis while walking on the boardwalk in Asbury Park NJ one evening when she appeared there many years ago. She really started to draw a crowd & she scampered off to the security of the theater nearby. We really lost a great one when we lost her.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game has zero instructions, but that is kind of the point. This game is just you and your brain. GOOD LUCK! !!!
B000002GFC|5.0|Great collection of great tunes especially &#34;Tales of Brave Ulysses&#34; which is one of my all time favorites. The lyrics are magical.
B008CRC506|5.0|I loved Smash from day one and I am enjoying seeing it again. We have become so short sighted. It wasn't perfect but had great potential. Come on... we all love celebrity gossip! They should have taken it off the headlines and it really would have been a SMASH! Debra Messing was amazing!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a really cute game.I like the power-ups.it's really  colorful.I would recommend it to all my friends<br />Like Lays potato chips. Can't play it just once
B005ZMUQCK|4.0|My 3 year old loves all the characters but I was worried there might be some un-intended violence that he is too young to see. Besides the scary wheat harvester, this was really appropriate for his age and it sparked many questions in him regarding winning, friendship, saying goodbye, etc. Will watch again.
B002BU4HWE|1.0|This is a long, plodding movie that needed editing badly.  Mike Cimino (the director) is the master of the breathtaking sweeping shots of beautiful land and gatherings of people.  However, that is not a remedy for the fact that every scene is tortuously long, contains much extraneous footage (one only realizes that it is unnecessary until afterward).  At the time, it seems necessarily boring.<br /><br />This is the film that put United Artists out of business.  Bankrupted them.  It was considered a bomb upon its initial release.  Since perspectives change through time, and many were angered at Cimino's over-budget irresponsibility, I decided to watch this with fresh eyes, thinking that perhaps this really was a great movie that got a bad rap.  It isn't and it didn't.<br /><br />Perhaps the only use for this movie is that it be shown to the terminally ill - for it can make 3 hours seem like an eternity.
1400069807|1.0|The problem of added sugar, salt, and fat in foods deserves a book, as does obesity, but this is not the book.  I can't account for the favorable reviews--as others have said, the writing is repetitive and far from \\"crisp,\\" and there are no new or exciting examples or facts.  It may be that this book fits the formula of:<br />1)  Identify a big problem in our culture<br />2)  Find someone to blame (and who doesn't like bashing evil corporations?)<br />3)  Throw in a lot of pseudo-science about the topic<br />4) Suggest an easy solution (since the obesity problem is cause by evil corporations, all we need is for our government to get to work on our side...)<br /><br />The book does have passages which suggest the \\"book that might have been,\\" such as when the author describes a conversation with he daughter of the creator of \\"lunchables\\" who won't serve them to her own children (guess why!).  The bottom line is that adults buy food which is bad for them and their families, and the presence of obesity relates directly to level of education.  The problem is that the packaging and marketing of this book by the corporations of the NYT and Random House needs to have #1 - 4 from above, and the idea of looking at obesity as yet another problem involved with lack of education and other healthy cultural influences would not be met with the rave reviews of people looking for someone to blame.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|The movie has most of the action stars from the 1980s.  All perform well.  Great to see them back on screen.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is good. Simuliar to the game provided with Windows. Needs an easier way to exit the game to make 5 stars.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I love escape games, but most of them are simplistic.  Not this one.  Each floor gets more difficult, the clues more devious and take more creative thinking - what fun!  Can't wait for more floors!!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|With so many writerless tv shows out there why such a cleverly written show ended is beyond me. Watch season 1 and you will have no choice but to get 2,3,4, and 5. Which will lead to other shows like Warehouse 13....what?! Just wait there is more.
140006922X|5.0|Aslan covers the history of a complex and peculiar area in a readable, self-evident manner.  His presentation of Jesus as a zealot is well within the available historical and biblical record. His book augments what many theological experts have said before; in my opinion it does not detract from the overall understanding of the importance of Jesus in the shaping of the modern world's religions.  It stands as tangible proof that he (Jesus) is still being discussed, investigated and interpreted some 2000 years after his death.  Even the most doubting believer has got to come to the conclusion that something happened in that part of the world when this man appeared.  Personally, I find the person/Christ/Son of God/zealot -- whatever -- fascinating. His very existence makes a statement which is still being heard today.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|Love the Transformer movies. Great CGI and the storyline isn't bad either. I wonder what they'll come up with next.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|I finally bought monsters inc. Again! Its my family personal favorite. Its good to find it at a good price and good shipping. Shipped to me right away. Plays perfectly!
1416549447|5.0|I never did any type of sports when I was a child or a teenager, but right now I'm 24 years, and overweight to some extent, I saw a pretty bad video in youtube explaining the chi running technique, and thought it was silly at first, but when I started digging more about the subject I became impressed, and thought I give the book a shot.<br /><br />Right now, I can run 3 miles(I know it's not impressive) without stopping or feeling tired or with any kind of pain at the end of the run, breathing/exhaling through my nose the entire time, and with a very good focus level, I would highly recommend this book to anyone trying to change, and make their life better.<br /><br />5/5 I would definitely recommend this book
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It was a great read, i didn't want to put it down. I'm sad it had to end. A friend recommended it and i initially thought i wouldn't care for it. BUT I DID:)
0440416027|5.0|This book has wonderful imagery, but what enjoyed was the layout of the story and the layers.<br />A young boy's baby sister could be dying, the family moves into a new home where the boy and his new friend discover love and compassion and the power of believing in something.<br />I would recommend this book to young adults and under, although I am almost fifty and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />discover the beauty around them, the importance of
B0091Q82L8|4.0|The Who<br />Recorded Live at Hull City Hall, February 15, 1970 (2 CD set)<br /><br />I agree with the majority on this one.  This is a very fine performance but \\"Live At Leeds\\" has more energy and one more song, but Hull is very entertaining and well worth owning.  Since their 1969 Woodstock performance has never been released in its entirety, this Hull performance probably comes closest to filling in the gaps of what that performance was like.<br /><br />4 ½ Stars for this one
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|Kids loved it (7 and 4 years old) and Mom cried at the end as always.  Not exactly your modern, hi-tech special effects - but the story carries the day!
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|Gave as a gift. Recipient is very happy. Charges multiple items. Just what they needed. Now they leave my portable charger alone.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved it. The way she writes it just keeps you wanting more. Sex love being mad and angry and laughing the next.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|I thought this game was just going to be cutesy and short, and only ordered it because I was desperate for a point and click, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not very long, and the environment isn't as complex as some,  but it has enough different locations to make it interesting.  The biggest plus is that there are NO stupid Hidden Object scenes!<br /><br />Folks who like a storyline won't find that here. It's more like an escape game -- explore the environment looking for keys (both physical and code related) to unlock new areas, until eventually you get out... no you don't. What the heck? Yes you do. No you don't. Darn it. Fun ending.  Looking forward to the promised sequel.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|I have watched this movie several times over the years. I still love it and find it inspiring and entertaining. The theme is one of my favorite--the meaning of life, the spiritual support we have as humans and the preciousness of each life. I enjoy Cage's acting prior to his hi-action films that don't showcase his acting skills.
1451673442|5.0|Just completed reading this book.  It has now changed my way of thinking how we must be grateful everyday for all we have or don't have.  A book I wish everyone would read!  It has daily homework which really makes you think of what is truely important in your life and how to make it happen.
B00A8ZZ570|5.0|In this latest recording by Chris Potter he takes things to a new direction with his first recording as a leader for the ECM label.  It is no secret that Potter is one today's best saxophonists and his work on this recording is amazing.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is not amazing ITS OVER THE TOP<br />I LOVE IT MUCH AND ITS FUNEST and the controls are easy
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Rum out of coins way to fast, but it is just a fun game. Perfect for the whole family. Easy to play and easy to figure out.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|It's not going to solve world peace - but it does a great job explaining gender bias and giving suggestions on how to deal with that.
B005LJETYI|4.0|Good stuff. Once things got rolling it really held my interest. I want to see the movie of this when it comes out..
1442346949|3.0|This book was o.k. It could have been about 50% shorter, with the redundancy removed. I really liked the book in the beginning, but after a while, it became repetitive and my interest waned. So, it started out as 5 stars, then dropped to 4, and then to 3, mainly because Isaacson kept reiterating the same concepts and introductions over and over.<br /><br />It was interesting to see how Jobs approached his work, but since the book focused mainly on his career, it was a bit skewed. It would have been insightful to have included more about his personal life (i.e., including more anecdotes about time spent with his wife and children over the years), that way we could get a better-rounded picture of Jobs, instead of just learning about his career life. I suppose the reason this book was written so skewed toward his career is that he didn't have much of a family life. Jobs even admits couple times that he wanted Isaacson to write the biography in order for his children to learn about their father. This seems to indicate there may not have been much to write about Jobs's personal life, even if Isaacson so desired.<br /><br />As one reviewer pointed out, the book is more attune to a collection of stories, as opposed to a documented timeline of his life. I think I would have preferred the timeline format more, since the book would have a clear flow. As it is, the book seems to continue to circle around through the decades, back and forth.  This is probably because the chapters seem to be written to stand on their own, as if to be posted as short snippets online or in a magazine. Hence, there's a ton of redundancy because Isaacson kept introducing concepts in each chapter so they could stand alone, as opposed to just introducing them once in the beginning of the book and then assuming the reader would remember them. In short, it would have been nice if Isaacson followed Jobs's minimalist perspective and have only included those parts necessary to explain the story, while keeping it flowing smoothly.<br /><br />Overall, I thought it was an o.k. book. I'm glad I understand more about Jobs's perspective and Jobs's excellent example of the success that comes from \\"making great products\\" as opposed to just \\"following the money\\".
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A seriously awesome read! Loved everything about it, so much so, I could read it over and over again &#60;3
B0094BB4TW|1.0|My facebook jams up every time I use this app.  I will try again some other time.  Waste of time right now.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|When you talk about cliff hangers,you have to be talking &#34;GAME OF THRONES&#34;. It's like every week waiting to see your loved one that you just get to see on Sunday evenings. The anticipation of what might happen and then seeing what did happen. Those Brits...one on puts great story line together and either excites you you makes you terribly sad. That's why I love it!!!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Originally bought this for my room mate. We both love it. It was worth every dime!! Very soothing music to live by!
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I am just learning Twitter and don't feel comfortable with it yet.  So far I like Facebook much better but we will see.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This is one of my favorite series.  Watching Alicia take the punches brought on by her husband, the press, attorneys, co-workers, evil mother-in-law &  confused kids and keep her dignity and grace in tact is heartwarming.  Her strength and courage under extreme pressure, and her ability to keep her head, outwit prosecutors and be the comforting hand holding attorney really show what women are made of.  Tough when we need to be, thoughtful and comforting when we need to be, and able to carry all those hats and stay sane.  Julianna Margulies is brilliant!  The supporting cast and co-stars are equally intriguing and have developed well.  The depth and topics discussed are informative and interesting!  Just a GREAT very well written show!
0316247545|5.0|Its an episode guide and has info on each character and other stuff like that. I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it. I actually want to get one myself because I am a fan as well.
1451662432|5.0|I have always loved Arnold so I had to read this biography and I have to say it was very interesting. I had a hard time putting it down, this dude has done everything! it is a very good read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love Pinterest!  it is my GO TO for all thing crafty and food wise.  Really, it's the Best Invention EVER!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|With the subtitles, you won't miss the delightful humor or the pathos.  This was great fun to watch - and my 92 year old mother liked it more than I.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you enjoy any kind of fantasy, pick up this series!  It will tear your heart out but you won't be able to pull yourself away. Fantastic!
B005VPRFSY|5.0|My son is into Star Wars legos right now and so he wanted to get a set for his best friend.  This one was perfect.  it was a great price and easy enough for a five year old to put together.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Best series to have come out for years. Kevin Spacey is great. Can't wait to see what happens. Highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! I the costumes are so funny and I an so addicted to this game! Buy it! :)
0894803123|5.0|Love it so much. I just made banana ice cream and it tastes just like the Ben and Jerry's you buy in the store. These recipes are real.They also include recipes for ice cream cakes and brownies and cookies to go in the ice cream. I recommend this to anyone that likes to make their own ice cream. I also bought one for my sister as a present and she was very excited about it.
B0089J270U|5.0|At $10.49 for this movie you can not go wrong.  Great music, and Donald O,Conners dancing.  The blue ray is very good, as is the sound.  A must buy if your a Monroe fan.
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|In general it has the same functionalities that the webmail, but it is not too fast...<br />The rest is OK
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Can't wait to see the second one! Despicable me was a great movie and the characters are hilarious to watch.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I've put on watching this because I felt it might be more for the younger crowd, but finally decided to give it a try.  Absolutely loved it.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|S.J. Watson did a wonderful job of eliciting suspenseful emotion from the reader. I thoroughly enjoyed the twists and turns Christine endured on your path to discovery. The book did leave much to desire. For the amount of detail Watson used for Christine's fall, Christine's redemption and success lacked.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|It was okay, but seemed rather slow and not what I expected for a Tommy Lee Jones movie.  I can watch a lot of his movies more than once, but not this one.
1401235417|5.0|The story in this series is absolutely addicting and the amazing art only makes it better. I loved the bizarre use of certain paneling and artwork in this comic as well. I'm absolutely going to read the next volume and I'd recommend you read this too, if you love Batman, that is :)
B000YABS8E|4.0|I've always enjoyed this movie.  It's a good concept and Brendan Frasier does a great job in his role.  Nice, fun, flick.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't get enough of Downtown Abbey.... I hope it never ends. I'm looking forward to season four. The suspense is killing me.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Didn't anyone else tire of the repetitive nature of and language in this book?  Characters and concept are mildly intriguing.  Writing becomes lazy and the ending is abysmal.
B00005JLIU|5.0|My best friend and I used to watch this movie and quote all the funny lines. It is very funny and music is fun.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|At least this book has a plot and some character development.  Better than the first, but still is, at best, a beach read.
B000MR1V22|5.0|Families come in all different shapes and sizes. This movie contained a very humorous (albeit dark) look interactions between its members. I am not a Steve Carell fan but he was very good. Have loved Greg Kinear since Talk Soup. Alan Arkin was perfect for his role. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to put the &#34;FUN&#34; back in dysfunction.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Nice blend of realistic characters that (especially if you've ever lived out West) you'll feel right at home with.  If you like the television show, definitely try the books. Just different enough to be different, but very similar flavor.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|These songs were popular when my husband and I first met, so they remind us of those good old days.  That's why I got it.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|My fiance just loves this movie. This is a second copy, so we can give the first copy to my dad.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|For the most part I really enjoy this app.  However, I do have ocassional freezes where I have to close the app and reopen it.My only other complaint is that it is a week or sometimes longer after they have made an upgrade (new room) before it is available on the mobil app.  I run this on Kindle Fire HD.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Drags...along...no surprises. Gets three stars for the FX. This movie has no real magic, no 'wows,' no 'Ah-Has,' Kinda slow, flat, and predictable. I rent movies on Amazon to see if I'll buy it. I'm glad I watched it; but, this movie is safe from purchase.
B0045DO8II|5.0|Very briefly, this is one of the greatest live albums ever from one of the greatest Southern Rock bands ever. I have loved this album since I first heard it back in 1978 and would say to anyone that loves Southern Rock or just good rock and has not heard this album, you just have to. For $3.99 Amazon are practically giving it away.<br /><br />BTW This album is much better than their 1993 live album 'Hittin' The Road'. HtR is a very good album but BIBA is in a class of its own.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great season and enjoyed every minute. Highly intense drama throughout season, so be prepared to be shocked. Cannot wait to see Season 4.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This game is a true point and click game, made you think.  Though I did not like the ending, it leaves an option for a sequel. Thumbs up ,good game.
B005TMXT6Q|4.0|Lila Downs is widely known in the Oaxaca area as well as other areas.  Her voice range is astonishing!  Nice easy music to listen to.  Songs are in Spanish.
0763644765|5.0|grandson really like the potty book.  loves looking at the brightly colored pictures of the baby on the new potty.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I cannot believe that Amazon would endorse this game. Animal fighting is illegal in all 50 states -- just ask Michael Vick! Won't someone please think of the monkeys?!!! It's bad enough to cage them in these tiny phones, but then make them fight...<br />Please at least do these monkeys the favor of caging them in a more spacious tablet... at least then you can enjoy the fights in glorious HD -- you sickos
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Has office features, some surpassing  the basic version, but more is offered on larger,  full computer program models. Ok for limited use.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Downton Abbey is something of a guilty pleasure, but it is a pleasure, because the characters are so interesting, and so likable -- or hatable as the case may be.  Season Two is really an ending, and so I'm not sure I'll like Season Three as much.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|Not as good as we hoped. But watchable even to the annoying over the top end. Leading lady now doing better stuff!
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|Being a fan this was an enjoyable look behind the curtain. Surprisingly they included even folks no longer associated with the band or that had a beef about something. Like some reviewers said, warts and all. Being a musician myself, it's great hearing what went into the songwriting and performing. Sound quality of everything in the set is excellent. Only flaw for me is the short concert. As others have noted, they should have included the whole show, which is what I expected. Even so, what was included is probably the best of the show. And it does sound great in 5.1 surround.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book is a must read, you will never forget this book. Been quite some time as I came across a book like that.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Love, love, love APPLAUSE!  It's the best song Lady Gaga has produced since FAME.  It's classic Gaga!  I love the  synthesizer spelling out A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E and the cheering crowd in the background.  It'll make you want to put your hands up & applause!  Well produced!
B001AQMBJQ|4.0|Definitly Lost is the best series ever. Can't wait to see what's coming on the next chapter. Packaging and the blu ray quality enhance the lost experience.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|as Jesus is attributed to have said, the truth shall set you free, the book relies on historical data to reconstruct what has been deliberately or mistakenly obscured from the adherents of Christianity.<br /><br />Reza, as usual, has done a brilliant job at simplifying a complicated subject, at least for a Muslim like me.<br /><br />i will also recommend 'revelations' by Elaine Pagels and 'Jesus and Paul' by James Tabor as they further corroborate Paul's role towards changing the original message of Jesus, which was completely in line with basic Judaic beliefs, to Christianity as practiced today.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|The CD arrived after being on order for about two weeks.  The packaging was more than adequate.  Mr. Benson's perfomances on this CD were nothing short of superb.  He is clearly one of our greatest jazz performers alive today.  Hopefully, he will continue to be so for many more years to come.
0446699616|1.0|Once again, DeMille disappoints. He should really go into retirement because it's clear he is completely written out. Don't waste your valuable time with this awful effort.
0307593312|5.0|An extraordinary book by an extraordinary writer.  It's almost 1000 pages and I've read it twice.  It's Wagnerian in scope, but with a unique Japanese sensibility.  It's as if Murakami writes from another world.  In fact, if not another world, at least another reality or plane figures significantly in this masterpiece.  But ultimately, although it's a compelling story, Murakami uses it as a platform to explore the issues of the meaning of existence and how one perceives one's existence.  Truly amazing.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Very fun adventure game with great challenges. The world and levels are beautifully crafted. The characters are genuine and very polish. A hidden gem worth checking out now.  Runs great on the new Nexus 7 with the high def display.
0312243022|1.0|But can a single day in the life of an ordinary woman be made into enough for a novel? ~ The Hours, page 69.
B00008S7KC|5.0|This DVD is a look at the pure entertainment of music making by Pink Floyd. For most, Pink Floyd is just an awesome musical hallucinatory experience.  For a few that really know what the secret message is, every song of Pink Floyd is connected strands to a story about a guitar player that sold his soul to the devil to be a rock star and tortures him self to death in a hotel room.  “There's a kid who had a big hallucination. Making love to girls in magazines.  He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith.  Could anybody love him. Or is it just a crazy dream? And if I show you my dark side, Will you still hold me tonight? (From The Final Cut-The Final Cut/1983).  The Wall is its centerpiece.  “Listen to the man who raves at his wall.  Making the shape of his question to Heaven” (From Set the Controls to the Heart of the Sun-A Saucerful of Secrets/1968) “Who calls the tune in the court room?” (From Free Four-Obscured by Clouds/1972) &#34;Making a date for later by phone, and if your alone I’ll come home.” (From San Tropez—Meddle/1971: Surprise, surprise surprise!).  “We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud….. Tomorrow brings another town and another girl like you. (From Summer ’68-Atom Heart Mother/1970; Dirty Women).  Most think Pink Floyd is a drug oriented band. Well, you can trust them.  But, you have to pay VERY CLOSE attention to the lyrics to understand the secret message weaved throughout the songs connecting them into one story that climaxes with the wall.  What are they whispering in Julia’s Dream?  Why would they be whispering that? What did you dream, it’s alright we told you what to dream.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love this book. It's just fantastic. I could not stop reading it. Ender is a boss. You rock Ender.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I like it but the look of it is not the same the picture you see in advertisement but it does what it is mentioned for
1609613937|4.0|I learned about Mcdoudall on youtube and was very impressed with his insights and clear communication skills. This book is a concise reference work that I keep close in order to stick with the plan. I've lost  30 pounds over the course of a year with the help of this book and as he promised, indeed, I feel great.
B008VZAQTG|5.0|Incredible movie! Michelle should have won the Oscar for her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe! Eddie is also great! I realized that he was the lead in Les Miserable, as I was watching this movie! Very well casted, produced, directed, acted, production value, off the roof, movie!
0345803485|1.0|A friend passed the first book in this trilogy to me and said we'll trade opinions after you read it.  The book has all the worst traits of a cloying 1960s Harlequin romance after you drop it into a blender with the Story of O.  A 26 year old billionaire (and we know those are thick on the ground) meets a shy young thing and B & D ensues.  Not sure how they found the time between the lip biting and head cocking.  The worst writing I've read in a long time, the line that finished me off was after the woman performs fellatio on the man and then says \\"Gee, Mister, you taste mighty good!\\"  Was she channeling Elly May Clampett?  Does the British author really think Americans speak that way?  It's often awkward when a writer sets a story in a country not their own but others do and do it well.  Martha Grimes is an excellent example.  Ms. James is not.<br /><br />Writing is a very personal vocation and it is sad when you can't find one redeeming quality in a book.  It feels like the author sat at her desk and decided to write a best selling book and started tossing in the ingredients.  One young handsome billionaire, one beautiful girl, kinky sex etc.  More like marketing than writing.<br /><br />The only saving grace is the book was given to me, I'd be pretty miffed if I had paid for this tragic waste of paper.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I tried watching the original UD circa 1970s.  So dreary so boring.  Was I ever glad when I saw that this remake which I missed the first time around was available.  I'm thinking Downton Abbey creators and writers did a little cribbing from this version.  But they couldn't touch it. No melodrama here.  Actual controversy covered.  Loved it!
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I manage quite a few pages on FB.  this app helps me keep it straight and makes it easy to share and organize pictures on the various pages
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|had fun decorating the different clients, kids love to play it too. its like the magnetic wooly willie game gone high tech.
B006LXQID8|5.0|I love this movie!  Great theme, love the way its shot and who wouldn't love the story?? One of the best.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|Its a great fun game but theres one problem once i got it i was fine playing it for a few months and then i tried to rate the game and the i couldnt play anymore so i decided to uninstall the game after i tried everything and then couple weeks later i try rating the game again and now i cant play it at all same as before and its kind of aggravating because i spent money on it so if anyone knows how to help me get it working again please let me know just leave a recomendation
B000Y0Q5NM|3.0|I love this show and would give it 5 stars but the volume leveling (or the lack thereof) is awful.
014241722X|1.0|Not certain even my grandsons would enjoy it.  It seems a bit too simple for the age it targets.  I will send it to them and let them decide.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A great &#34;twisted&#34; JFK story that only Stephen King can produce!! A must read for all those conspiracy theorists out there ;-)
0142421375|1.0|I selected this book because I really like John Grisham's  books, but did not pay close enough attention, so did not realize he wrote for young people too.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. Picture is great and dvd quality is excellant. I recommend it to anyone who loves great movies.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Ozzy is back and better than ever on hits God is Dead and the End of the Beginning, a great effort by all and a great album.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I like Matthew McCounaughey and I enjoyed this movie very much....I love coming of age stories, and this one did not fail me.....I was not disappointed with the ending either.  It was a welcomed change from &#34;Magic Mike&#34;.  =))
B00BEXB18M|5.0|A little change of pace for Megadeth, but a great album with great riffs and vocals, super collider is one super album.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I .LOVED IT..This is GRISZHAM ON STEROIDS.. POWERFUL.  I couldn't put  down. A Must read. I have read almost all and this is awesome.
B005HSL626|4.0|I downloaded this game on my moms kindle.  It was a lot of fun.  I needed some fun games to play while traveling this summer.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This is a solid game. It is a good substitute for Wow. The gameplay is very good and the controls are simple. I would recommend playing this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It has fighting, blood and guts, family, hopeless romantic love, family issues, an overbearing government. All I have to say is read it, you won't be disappointed!!
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|A book anybody who belongs to organized religion should read. Not only does it provide reliable evidence for its claims but it reveals the corruption that goes on in religion. A book that will really put you in perspective.
0394800389|5.0|I have always been a Dr Seuss fan and love rhyming books that helped me begin reading when I was young.

B004FRX0MY|5.0|I hate how I fill up my phone and have to make the\\"painful decision\\" which albums/playlist to delete- not an issue here! I take all my music and the importer is easy to use and update my library. It's easy to find the music and perfect when you have many devices!
B000UR9T8C|4.0|Spidey, I'm sad to say, is going downhill. I think part of the reason I feel this way is that I've just never liked Tobey Maguire as Spidey. It's kind of like Robert Urich being cast as Spenser in the old &#34;Spenser: For Hire&#34; TV series....he just wasn't how you pictured the main character. It's still not bad viewing, but I thought the bad guys in this one were kind of lame, and I wasn't really happy about Harry getting killed off helping him.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I grew up a Star Trek fan.  I was excited about the 2009 reboot which I thought was well done but not stellar.  I thought some of the in ship scenery could have been better (no one wanted to see an engine room which looks like a brewery).  There was definetely a disparity between bridge and rest of the ship.  I also took issue with Kirk going from Cadet to Captain but I digress.<br /><br />The point is that the broke the cannon and made room for all new Star Trek stories.  They instead chose to rehash the Khan Story and did a rather poor job of it.  I though the movie had good action in it, but the refrences to the original Wrath of Khan felt cheap.  If you are going to reboot, then reboot and come up with new material, don't try to shoe horn the existing cannon into the new format which Abrams seems to be trying to do here.<br /><br />I sincerely hope they never make another.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|&#34;beware my power, Green Lantern's light!&#34; As a kid growing up, Green Lantern was my absolute favorite superhero, with Daredevil running a close second. This is good old fashioned entertainment, and I would love it if there was a second one on the horizon!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I don't know why so many have pooh poohed this movie. I liked it. It does need a sequel though to finish things up.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|You need this program for all your internet programs and this was one I have used many times and I keep it updated regularly so my computer or kindle works good.
140006922X|5.0|I found this book surprisingly engaging.  The author has a clear genuine admiration for Jesus the man and makes every effort to paint an hisotricaly accurate picture of Jesus's life and work.  I particularly found the parts on Jesus's relationship to Paul enlightening.  I am not religious scholar, but wondered why Paul, not a follower of living Jesus, was considered an apostle, and how Paul's interpretation of Christ became the prevalent one. The authors handling of thei topic was very interesting.  There were redundant and slow parts, but overall I strongly recommend reading the book.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Bought this for my wife as a gift after we saw it on PBS.  Fantastic powerful singers.  (Jonas dude was a bit weak next to the seasoned stage performers)
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|This app works great on my Kindle Fire HD. It is very enjoyable, and it keeps me entertained for hours. Easy to get started.
B005544TRQ|5.0|One of the best show of the year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Highly recommended!<br />You will want to keep on watching and want more seasons!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|A very interesting story, if more than a little unsettling, dealing with an airline pilot with a serious problem. Not very complimentary to pilots, but a compelling tale of a man's struggle with addiction.
B009CG9CXO|5.0|Had a house at the ocean.  Never went in above my ankles.  I can swim well but... Only in a pool.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|love ths game but the first game is better because you can be the zombies and this game you cant
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|Excellent maze game, is a joy to play, very good control of balancing ball on platforms, hidden stars are fun
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great book. I cannot wait to start the next one.<br />There is so much to look forward to in the next books!<br />I love the detailed descriptions of characters and events!
B000007MVD|5.0|If you're a fan of the era, its worth having.  Its an adventure listening to what was then.  Good Purchase
B009VSW15Y|1.0|i hate it cant send to my kindle and i want it to be having this anymore so stop now
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games is the best book ever. I would totally recommend it. All three of the book's are awesome.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Joss Whedon is a bloody genius. I was first introduced to the Whedonverse via The Avengers, and all I needed was a slight nudge before descending into obsession from there. Once More, With Feeling does all the things a good story is capable of doing: it makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you happy, and it makes you love Joss Whedon for the fact that it exists. And it does all of these things WITH MUSIC. Bloody amazing music. Every track on this brilliant album invokes the same emotions felt while watching the episode. If you enjoyed the episode, purchase this album. You will be glad you did.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I really enjoyed Naked Heat, but I don't know if I liked to more because I am a fan of the tv show or not.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It. Is very fun to play and I think the training is cool too. I wish the gear and tack was less expensive.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is a great show.  Very entertaining and I must say, I am now hooked.  I started watching this in season 2 and wanted to know the background, so I ordered Season 1.  This was very enjoyable.  I highly recommend this.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved Bared to You and was looking forward to the next book in the series.  It was a great read not as good as Bared to you but maybe my expectations were too high.  Still looking forward to the next book lets hope it is more like the first one.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I started watching this show after Season 1 and have become so hooked on this wonderful show, that I had to see Season 1 to get the background information.  It filled in a lot of gaps and made it much more understanding.  I highly recommend.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Sometimes it is best to not have sequels.  the first book in the series was awesome and book 2 was good but book 3 leaves me not so happy.  It was a ok read but I thought there were only 3 books in the series.  The problem it left us hanging and I am not sue I am willing to purchase anymore books.  I love the characters but they are done.
B005PK56TA|5.0|One of the best horror stories I have watched since Tales from the Crypt, and that was a bad comparasoin for such a great show. I loved how everything in the story unfolded and can't wait to start the new story in season two. Best t.v. show ever. I was hooked on this show for a moment.
B008LV8TSU|3.0|I kept getting confused as to who was who and where they were.  I would like to see a movie made of this book as I believe with the right special effects, it could be really awesome.
140006922X|5.0|It exposed me to a new way of understanding the Bible which, as a living, breathing document, needs constant, personal attention and relationship. I love the difference between Truth and Facts, which Reza introduces eloquently; I only wish he had spent more time on it, because it's such a powerful concept. We underestimate the extraordinary impact of the Scientific Revolution, and we overestimate the primacy and effectiveness of the scientific method (David Hume, anyone?), so this is a really healthy reminder of that. Plus, it's beautifully written. Accessible for any reader, but deep enough as to be really thought-provoking.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|I thought this was supposed to be a comedy? This had one or two laughs but otherwise it was a drama, and I would not add romantic in front of that. This was a huge disappointment and I am glad I didn't pay to see it.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Wanted this movie for a long time got it for a great price .What an epic this picture is it will be remember forever.
0307476073|1.0|Could not believe how shallow and spoiled this author is.  Could not believe that she would be outfitted incorrectly at Sports Chalet, whose reputation has dropped in my book.  Amazed that she survived this strenuous hike, but was able to at the pampering of those along the way.  And cannot believe that she punished herself by carrying everything but the kitchen sink.  I can atone in a monestary on the weekend and give the Pacific Crest Trail its respect.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|I really like the series. Couldn't stop watching till I was done with the series. It engages my mind. It gives me new ideas.

B0017WCG48|1.0|I have this set along with the original 1986 release under the Music for Nations label and let me just say... it's pretty quiet and cold compared to the original, I also have an original US vinyl release and I'm sure it's closer to the MFN label than the warner bros label.<br /><br />The other thing that begs the question is the quality of the original recording, it's obviously had some damage over the years and I'm not complaining about the vinyl quality itself as it's fantastic but the quality of the sound is utter crap! Such a waist of good vinyl...<br /><br />You're spending around $50 anyway so do yourself a favor and just purchase the Music for Nations label or the original US release not this crap.

B000KQGOA4|5.0|These recordings, made in 1960 and 1961, show the combination of Karajan and the VPO off to their best. Both of these pieces were recorded with the BPO at a later date but it is these earlier recordings that at still most revered. Both recordings have been remastered using the latest 24 bit technology and the result on this disc is the expected increased 'presence' with added internal clarity and detail plus dynamic and frequency response compared to the original CD releases.<br /><br />Turning to the performances themselves, the first thing to note is the high degree of spontaneity that Karajan manages to create in both pieces. In the opening Planets Suite, Mars has a real sense of menace and it is interesting to hear how Karajan is able to bring out different tonal effects from the middle brass to enhance this. The use of his Wagner tubas makes for an exciting tonal impact in this movement. Jupiter has nobility and sweep without the unsung words imposing themselves on the consciousness as is can do in some English performances.<br /><br />Venus avoids sentimentality while still achieving the appropriate purity of line and Saturn has true grandeur - nothing feeble about this vision of old age. It is a reminder that the Romans revered their older population as having much to offer in terms of experience. Saturn, the God, represented these strong ideals for the Romans. The organ role in Uranus is effectively done without the exaggeration of balance to be found in the later digital version with the BPO. Neptune fades to perfection. Similar comments of further approval could be made throughout but suffice it to say that this has long been a recording of reference, often because of its impressive and effective independence of thought. Karajan always had a reputation for keeping a firm grip on overall concepts of shape and construction and this recording is a good example of that ability.<br /><br />Karajan had a particular reputation for his Richard Strauss interpretations and performances. There is an unerring sense of direction about his Strauss that simply feels right. This Don Juan is impressive and sweeps all before it. The tonal and emotional range is noticeably a few degrees warmer than those to be found in his later BPO recordings, impressive though they undoubtedly are and the playing of the VPO, both individually and corporately, is beyond criticism.<br /><br />This is a distinguished pair of recordings of distinguished musical visions. They have been commented on and referred to with admiration ever since they were made. They certainly deserve to be ranked among the finest of both works and at this reasonable price and with coupling they make for a very tempting purchase option.<br /><br />I would therefore suggest that the recordings on this disc, especially in their remastered form, deserve their legendary status, particularly that of the Holst, and on that basis the disc deserves serious consideration as both an 'only' or as an alternative purchase of these works.ons and performances.

B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Sharp, colorful graphics, lots of customization, and controls you could teach a monkey to use.  And to top it off, it's free!  Winner, Winner, Banana Cream Pie Dinner.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Ive been using it for 3 weeks now and Im really happy with my purchase.  I was using a Logitech m510 so i wasnt sure how i would like going back to a wired mouse,  but I honestly never notice the wire.<br />This is a good-looking mouse with nice blue led lighting thats programmable via the software.<br /><br />The responsiveness is nice,  better than my logitech.  I like the on the fly dpi adjustment button because it makes going back to my \\"comfortable\\" setting much easier than having to launch the software.<br />Everything from the box its packaged in to the weight can signifies quality parts and construction. This mouse is a solid buy.

B00EFNXPFK|2.0|I really wanted to like this album.  I own the majority of the albums John Mayer has put out with the exceptions of Born and Raised and now Paradise Valley.  I can say I will not be purchasing either one of these.  Experimenting with country music has not been an improvement to Mayer's catalog, but I will say Paradise is better than Born and Raised.  I don't think I can stand to listen to either though.  Mayer's music used to draw me in and have me tapping my feet or humming along with almost all of his tunes. I am bored with this album in less than 5 minutes. These two latest albums don't showcase Mayer's best attributes.  If you haven't listened to Where The Light Is, you really need to give it a shot.  Mayer really shines on the whole album, but especially the blues inspired tracks.  John should stick to what made him great!

B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|My favorite season so far is season 3 (Who Watches the Watchers is absolutely my all time favorite episode, besides any Data episodes)  but this one is AWESOME as well.  Data dreams for the first time in this season!  And it is trippy as hell.
B00EI6E17A|1.0|Nothing new just a regurgitated sound, I call it fartpop it doesn't surprise me that it's doing not so good in sales.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I bought the CD first and then the vinyl - lets start there.  I don't believe the vinyl was mastered FOR vinyl with the greatest of care.  It sounds all right but when I compare it with a few of my old Mo-Fi half speed mastered LP's it just doesn't have the presence that I hear in some of the older vinyl releases.  All of us vinyl guys know the sound where all the instruments live in their own little area - the LP sounds too midrangey or something.<br /><br />Okay - having said that - I probably listen to this album three or four times a week.  Full disclosure, Jeff Lynne could release a record of just about anything and I would buy it and I absolutely love it.  \\"She\\" is a masterpiece.  But the whole album is great - I hope he has part 2 in the works as he has alluded to.  He always seems to release records at a point in my life where I need to hear them and this is true with this one too.  Thanks Jeff - keep it coming!!
B000007T1M|5.0|Again. This is a CLASSIC. Do I really need to say anything else? In my humble opinion this is the best CD of all time. Itunes doesnt carry it (which says a lot about apple and their fascist regime) so you better get it at Amazon.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Well connected! More than a passing glimpse into a previously obscure part of our ever shrinking world. The characters and story lines connect cultures and individuals and plots over a diverse network of twists and turns.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Had no problems with setup, seems that issues with the Netflix app for Android have been fixed. (black screen)<br /><br />My current setup is Charter cable internet (30 megabit line) via an SBG6580 modem+router combo, devices that communicated without issues are a laptop (1st-gen Core i3, 8GB RAM, discrete graphics), HTC One, HTC One X, Samsung Galaxy S 4, Nexus 4, and Nexus 7. I have the Chromecast drawing power from the AC outlet.<br /><br />Once more software support arrives (Hulu, HBO Go, Pandora, etc.) this little $35 dongle will wipe away all the $100+ boxes. Right now, if you have a Roku or Boxee, it's hard to recommend the Chromecast. It's faster to start up a YouTube cast or Netflix cast through this device than it is to fire up a game console, so if you don't want everyone to crowd around your phone/tablet/laptop to check out a video, this will be a better option. Then anyone with a smartphone can queue up the next video!<br /><br />It's changed the way I watch YouTube, and I've never had a Netflix account before, so I'm enjoying that.<br /><br />I do get weird HDMI-CEC behavior. It won't turn the TV on automatically, and sometimes it will glitch and reload the current input when I play a YouTube video after another. I think it's Chrome for desktop switching the control over to a different tab, which is triggering HDMI-CEC to switch inputs to the Chromecast (which is already selected). Anyways, could also be a problem with my TV... I got the Chromecast plugged into HDMI2 on a 32\\" 720p LG HDTV purchased about 3-4 years ago.
1451695195|4.0|The fact that Eben Alexander, M.D., is a neuroscientist and had a near-death experience while miraculously recovering from bacterial meningitis, has made his book a best-seller as well as brought up much discussion on NDEs and the feeling of oneness and happiness that are usually experienced in this state.<br /><br />As the 5,631st person to review this book, I've already read rebuttals, such as from Steven Novella on the Neurologica blog that, \\"Alexander claims there is no scientific explanation for his experiences, but...they occurred while his brain function was either on the way down or on the way back up, or both, not while there was little to no brain activity. During this time he would have been in an altered state of consciousness, with different parts of his cortex functioning to different degrees. This state is analogous to certain drug-induced mental states, or those induced by hypoxia and well documented, and there is even some overlap with the normal dream state.\\"<br /><br />I'm interested in the science vs. faith issue and feel they can be compatible. I don't believe science can actually explain what happened to Dr. Alexander during his NDE - such as being guided by a biological sister he had never met during his life as an adopted child. I am fascinated by the revelations he had while in his NDE, where he experienced above all else, LOVE. He writes that he learned, \\"Love is, without a doubt, the basis of everything.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Alexander writes that he found love to be the most single important emotional AND scientific truth in the universe. He claims that our brain is a barrier to our higher knowledge. Shamans and medicine men have long used mind-altering drugs to draw back the curtain of the rational mind to connect with spirit and the energy of the universe, love.<br /><br />They do this for healing purposes, and I found Dr. Alexander's book healing as well. I wish everyone could experience the unconditional love and acceptance that he experienced on his journey. It's available to us all - meditation and prayer are recommended ways to experience this oneness. Opening the Third Eye Chakra and Crown Chakra in my experience have also allowed one to feel at one and in tune with higher consciousness and \\"knowing.\\"<br /><br />Science still has much to discover about the mechanism of consciousness. There are still profound mysteries surrounding the spiritual or divine realm, our experience of reality, and whether there is a God. Dr. Alexander writes an intriguing story of his experiences before, during and after his coma and NDE, all ending with the beautiful message that we are connected as One through our divine link with God. I found it a very interesting read, and basically embrace his message, whether or not NDEs can be scientifically validated. I'm passing the book on to my mother who is still mourning the loss of my father. Who doesn't want the comfort of believing that our souls go on and experience wonder and beauty in the next life?<br /><br />I applaud Dr. Alexander for sharing his story at the risk of criticism from his colleagues and the scientific community in general. It is well-written and inspirational, two very important criteria for me when judging a book.<br /><br />Namaste!<br />Becca Chopra, author of Chakra Secrets, The Chakra Diaries, and Balance Your Chakras - Balance Your Lifeced on his journey.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved the treatment in this book. It was captivating and really held my interest. Hated when it ended...I wanted more!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Great book! I was engaged from beginning to end. The storyline is complex, so it takes a while to get a handle on it. This book keeps you thinking the entire time trying to figure out what is going on. I can't wait for the next book, it can't be released soon enough!
1781162646|4.0|There are tons of reviews about this book on here. I'm gonna keep it short. Although I did enjoy this book and it didn't take me long to read, I have one complaint. This whole story is pretty much just a story until you get to about page 200. That's when it turns into a Stephen King story. There is talk of a ghost and a killer earlier on in the story, and even a ghost sighting probably about halfway through, but the whole part about the killer is barely touched on until around page 200.
B002X9W50E|5.0|This is from the early days of the tour that was cut short by Bowies heart attack:  he's in fine form, the concert is long, he's affable, and the musicians--especially Gail Anne Dorsey--play well, and are clearly heard.  Although it's got many of his best known songs, it manages to have about ten &#34;new&#34; songs, from &#34;Heathen&#34; and &#34;Reality&#34;:  a very good balance, when you consider it, and a balance that builds in some ironic takes:  &#34;Never Get Old&#34; followed by &#34;Changes,&#34; for example.  It comes with three songs not on the DVD.  Recommended for anyone who appreciates db
B0063M22QO|5.0|just love this game can't stop playing. I would highly recommend this to anybody that likes Mahjong games. Take the time to try it out.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game.  It is simple but challenging.  I hated that it ended so soon.  I told friends at work about it and now they are all playing.  Looking forward to seeing more of it soon.
044654759X|4.0|I enjoyed the book and it kept me entertained even though the plot was predictable.  It was good enough that I passed it on to a friend.
B0009A40ES|5.0|I took this out of my local library to watch originally and just loved it's sentiment and evil. It, hopefully, is unbelievably because he just gets away with things by shallow people who don't see anything except themselves and their meaningless lives, and when he confesses, he's not believed. Well-written and directed. Haven't heard from the director, Mary Harron.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|steve Rowland the producer said this was magnificent, he is very well know for doing coming from reality<br />he had jack bruce from cream harry neilsen who was john lennons best fred on this recording super super cd
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Had to read this book as a summer assignment for school and I just say I enjoyed it! Not terribly long and tells a great story. Can get a little confusing and full at times but I guess that is to be expected of an 18th century novel. I would highly suggest it.

1439190275|5.0|A very interesting read.  I had always thought I wouldn't like Atkins, I believed it was all bacon!  I was so wrong....it's a great diet, the book is interesting, explaining along the way the science behind the idea.  So far I've lost 14lbs and hubby has lost 18lbs, and it's been so easy!  Highly recommend both the book and the diet to everyone.

B004V6BQ3O|5.0|I had looked at other mics that looked neat but were cheaper, but found they were poor quality, too large /bulky and sent them back.  This is for a Nikon D5000 dslr, and gets it's power from the camera battery.  It is not a shotgun high directional mic which I did not need, but more an all purpose.  I could see it also working with several camcorders as long as they have a 3.5 mic in jack.  I just tested it on an old RR engine going right by me and there was no distortion, and a nice full stereo sound. (I had the low cut switch on good due to low rumble of the RR engine--also good for windy areas)  I have not tried it in strong wind yet and would probably need an additional wind screen as all mics usually do in such situations.<br /><br />I especially like the fact it fits in my small camera case. (LowePro Nova 160) as well as an additional lens.  It also practically eliminates auto focus noise (coming from the motor and lens moving)  that the built in mic will pick up (not noticeable in most active outdoor shots with ambient background noise or  ie -the train, traffic, water, etc).  You will get some focus motor sounds if the area you are recording is a quiet room etc, I suggest turning off the auto focus if doing a recording of  a speaker or anything else auto focus would not be needed)<br /><br />All in all - a very good performing accessory that does not pretend to be anything else and nicely constructed (quality plastic material).  If you are planning to record voices from a distance ie- tv reporter, plays, wedding, then using a wireless lapel mic or hooking up to sound board is suggested.
1932907009|4.0|This is a great screenwriting text.  It's easy to read, easy to understand, and I think it's fairly easy to apply given that you as a writer have real drive and not a big mouth with no action (we've all met those people).  If you actually will write, then read this first.  I love his 15 beats explanation.  It's very much like Dov Simmon's 5 Uh-Oh/5 Oh S&^%/5 OMG theory.  I would say that a serious writer ought to follow Snyder's own caveat and read Syd Field, perhaps McKee, and others to round out your understanding.  This is NOT your first or last book.  It's an EXCELLENT book to put on your journey as a screenwriter.

B00AE4OGCU|5.0|It is a trilogy that I could not put down! Here I sit with bleary eyes after reading until the wee small hours. It is such an exciting<br />read that I could not put it down.the until the very end of the last book of the series.<br />The author keeps the reader enthralled from start to finish; no big surprises out of blue sky which unfortunately crop up in crime thrillers.<br />I can heartily recommend it as a must read for lovers of crime novels!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I bought this game because it seemed like a fun distraction and for the most part it was. Also, it was free! This is a fine game, but it really feels short when compared to most mobile games these days. I completed the first levels of this game, of which there are only 10 for right now. I'm hopeful that the developers of this title will extend the gameplay soon.
B000VUCIZE|5.0|This is the first time a book has encapsulated my views with respect to the grievous damage that dogmatic institutions have on society.<br /><br />A perfect society would make this a fourth grade text book!

B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Can anything be more turbulent than having your leg amputated as a teenager and losing your self-worth in the process? Sebastian is the story of a young man growing up in a not-so-palatable world, with all the accompanying disasters, irritation, lack of trust, betrayal, frustration; and yet he managed to pull through it all. His resilience, courage and hope are ones that will inspire many for generations to come. The 2nd book in The Three Nations trilogy, Christoph Fischer has woven reality in this 321-page fiction that is so engaging you simply cannot turn away.
0553386794|5.0|I'm not usually one for high fantasy.<br /><br />I'm annoyed with Eragon. I haven't read or watched Lord of the Rings yet, and as of now, I still have no interest to. The last time I read something set in the past that included magic, I wanted to bang my head against the wall. Everything was just so clich&eacute;.<br /><br />But I've heard good things about this book (and my dad vouched for the series) so I decided to try it out.<br /><br />I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The story follows the Starks, a noble family that rules most of the northern part of the Seven Kingdoms. When the king requests Eddard, the patriarch, to become his advisor, the family must split up to go where their duties lie: Jon, Eddard's bastard son, to the Wall to take up the black and defend the land; Eddard and his daughters to a court filled with deceit and intrigues; and Catelyn and her sons staying to guard Winterfell. But trouble is brewing. Winter is coming. War is drawing near. Mysterious deaths are questioned, claims to the throne are disputed, and trying to survive is all the Starks can do as the royal families play the game of thrones.<br /><br />The characters are awesome. None of them are completely good or evil, and you can't help but root for all of them (no matter how impossible that might be). Each has their own journey; each has their own distinctive voice. Their development, and their reactions and plots against the things that happen to them is the best part of the story so far. It's them that create the wonderfully vivid word you can't stop reading about.<br /><br />The best part can also be the downfall, I have to say. There are so. Many. Characters. I had to write the names down at first to keep track of all of them. Since the book constantly switches point of view, it could be ages until you read about the one you really want to hear from. Still, each story is fascinating; you can never complain about a part getting dull.<br /><br />Except the prologue. First time readers, I suggest you skip the prologue altogether.<br /><br />It's an epic, amazing fantasy (with only a minimum of magical shortcuts--the character have to rely on their own wits, and will probably die if they count on such a fickle thing as magic to help them). The characters and the plots are great. The setting is vivid and addicting. Honestly, I recommend this for anyone who has the time to read it.

B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Set around the period of the World War II, Christoph Fischer brings to life an epic tale of the struggle for survival of a love-struck couple from two different backgrounds. I'm not much of a fan of Historical Fiction, but for one of the few times in my life, I've read a historical fiction and thoroughly enjoyed it. The Luck of the Weissensteiners is a rich, insightful novel that explores the lives of people from various deep, multicultural backgrounds. A story so touching it will bring tears to your eyes. Highly recommended to all Historical Fiction fans.

B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I don't get why people come on here to review a product, and then give it low stars due to mastering. Yet in their reviews, they say the album content is good. For instance I saw a 2 star review that said the album was \\"pretty good, about what you'd expect after their last release\\". But then the same review went on to complain about the mastering. Give the album the stars it deserves, you can still warn people about bad mastering in a five/four star review. That being said this is an incredible album. The first album I've bought in years. Every song get's better and the whole thing wraps up as an experience, not just individual songs. You don't see that often nowadays. This is coming from an owner of all of Alice in Chains' albums, my favorite being \\"Jar of Flies\\". If you can't get over the fact that Layne Staley is no longer alive, and that AIC has a new singer, just don't bother listening to/reviewing the new stuff. It's all fantastic in it's own way. Sorry to ramble, I'm done.

If you already own a smart TV and/or a DVD player that has a built-in Web browser you should be able to do just about everything with them that this gadget is purported to do.<br /><br />Although I was disappointed that I could not make this device work in my home, Amazon allowed me to return it for credit.
0743497465|5.0|Rachel Sexton's day started out like any other, but before it really got going she'd been caught up in events beyond her control and now she finds herself in a military jet speeding through the sky at five times the speed of sound after a top secret meeting with the President of the United States.<br /><br />Rachel is a gister (intelligence analyst) for National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), she sifts through raw data, determines what's what, then writes an eyes only report for the President, though before today she'd never met the man. One man she has met though, is her father, who just happens to be the opposition candidate.<br /><br />The president has called Rachel in to the White House, because an important discovery has been made and he wants her to authenticate it. However, he doesn't tell her what it is, instead he says he wants her to see it first hand, without any preconceived notions.<br /><br />The plane takes her to a hastily built station in the Arctic where NASA has discovered a meteor supposedly locked untouched in the frozen ice since 1716. The meteor has insect fossils much larger than anything ever found on Earth. NASA it seems has discovered proof of extraterritorial life.<br /><br />And wouldn't you know it, NASA has been in trouble lately. In fact it's the political football Rachel's father has been bashing the President with. After Rachel and some other civilian scientists authenticate the find, one of them spies something fishy and he is immediately made dead. The others see some anomalies as well and one of them is killed out on the ice and now Kate and her surviving two companions are running for their lives as an elite Delta Force unit is trying to track and kill them.<br /><br />It would appear that a giant fraud has been underfoot, but who is behind it, the President, NASA or someone else, someone diabolical with his own agenda? And will Rachel get out of the frozen north alive. Well, of course, but will she stop the bad guy, get her man and live happily ever after, well that's something else altogether and you'll have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />Dan Brown has delivered a thriller that is bound to be made into a movie one day. Lots of action, plenty of adventure, great characters, a plot that never quits, terrific settings and an ending you'll never see coming, just a darn fine, stupendous read this book is.and live happily ever after, well that's something else altogether and you'll have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />Dan Brown has delivered a thriller that is bound to be made into a movie one day.

B00821OX98|5.0|My boyfriend and I binged on this series. We finished all three seasons in 8 days. That was two weeks ago & we still talk about it everyday and are going through a Falling Skies detox/depression. We can't find anything on Prime or Netflux that is as engaging, exciting, full of drama, suspense and fun. We did have to give it one or two shows before we were sold on it. Go ahead, give it a try!!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Ok I do enjoy it, on it's good days. On the bad ones it just sticks it won't do anything. I have un installed and re installed  yet it does nothing. Now it might just be my kindle or not. Just please consider this when getting the application.
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|normally I would give an app like this 3 stars, but I can't stand devs that fluff their app with fake reviews.  The game play is pretty monotonous nut fun for the first couple minutes.  Def not worth money imo.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I had this for my I pod and I spent all the gems and I don't know how to get them back so if u can plz tell me how
B000I2MRHE|5.0|wish I had this when my son was a little smaller but it does the job.  It keeps him on his tummy an entertained
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is probably the best app out there I love it new 8.o update coming in about 65 days check it out online to see the count down
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|KICK-ASS 2 WAS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST IF ANYTHING!!!! MARK AND JEFF DID SUCH AN AMAZING JOB!! LOVED IT!
B003MYYJD0|5.0|Very Beautiful,<br />nice,<br />comfortable<br />as add photos, the same<br />no scratches, damages or others,<br />easy to clean<br />resistant, reinforced<br />good conditions
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Cool game so far, easy but challenging enough to hold your attention.figure out which clues and items need to use first to get to the door and out then another one starts again
B00A77II0U|5.0|Fantastic graphics. Very challenging.  Hints if you really get stuck.  Great entertainment if you have several evenings free to play this great game.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Menu buttons are of screen on nexus 7, making it unplayable past the tutorial level. It also requires a lot more space than the initial download.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really excellent mystery. I didn't read it for a long time after it was recommended, but bought it for a vacation read and I'm glad I did.
B00338QENI|4.0|It is always good to know what happens behind the scenes in a medical setting. Mixing in the Lacks family brought this story to life. Good research, well told.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|An interesting book that was nominated for the Harper Lee Prize for Legal Fiction [...]<br />I thought it was an interesting book, but not a candidate for the Prize, since that honors books that portray the good that lawyers can do, and the lawyer in this book does some questionable things while defending his son.
B005DESVPO|5.0|If you like gritty blues with great guitar as well as more laid back live solo music you will love this CD.
B00B5AIB50|4.0|Good, but typical Karajan, &#34;I am the greatest&#34;...
B001684L0A|5.0|Paul Giamatti nailed it as an actor. One of the most relatable series in terms of the founding of the United States.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Good practice for other social bubble type games. A little touchy &amp; inaccurate with the method of aiming but still a very nice little game.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Good sci-fi movie with a good plot. I would watch it again and pay better attention to scenes that contribute to the overall meaning of the film.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|I have all of Chet Baker's original albums/cds....She has captured the music...as he did....The phrasing, the voice...makes me think that Chet has returned, in a slightly higher register...Miss Elias is superb!
1490313370|4.0|James Altucher's new book \\"Choose Yourself\\" is an amazing, inspiring read. Even the most lame, slothful reader should be prompted to think and reflect on their approach to their career.<br /><br />Most folks are in denial that we are moving toward a society without employees. Altucher calls them \\"permanent temporary\\" employees. During the 2008-09 market crash, companies got rid of tons of employees because they were no longer useful. Those jobs and \\"full-timers\\" are not coming back.<br /><br />Far from being a doomer-and-gloomer, the author uses this back drop to set the stage for the current and future environment we live in. He quickly transitions into \\"Johnny Appleseed\\" mode with a barrage of thought-provoking ideas.<br /><br />He inspires people to do one thing every day (they otherwise would not do) such as sleep 8 hours, eat 2 meals instead of 3, write down a list of ideas, etc.<br /><br />The list of ideas is a big one that is highlighted later in the book.<br /><br />The bottom line here is to position yourself to no longer be dependent upon some corporation to determine your future. He outlines specific lessons we should adopt in choosing ourselves first.<br /><br />Perhaps my only disappointment with the book is Altucher's use of some profanity. Totally uncalled for. The late, great baseball impresario Bill Veeck said that people who swore had an inadequate vocabulary. I expected better from a professional author and thought that an editor would red-line that copy, until I read that this book was self-published. I've read four other books this year and none of them dropped any f-bombs. Oh well.<br /><br />That's the only thing that would stop me from recommending \\"Choose Yourself\\" to a number of bright folks I know.
B005LE9R7W|5.0|I heard this during an acupuncture session--the arrangements and tracks are ideal for touch therapy sessions with patients and is perfect music for meditation and lullabies.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I love this app but I'm curious to know when the Kindle app is getting the update the ios  app has already gotten cause I have flipboard on my iPhone and it's much different than the Kindle version.
B003L20IJM|5.0|I liked this movie just as much as the first one.  I bought it for my grandkids who just loved it too.  I can watch it over and over with them.  Buy both of the movies,  you will not be disappointed.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Story remains engaging and thoughtfully written.  Not too sleazy or far fetched. Well acted. Keeps us returning for more episodes.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|If you have grandkids this is for you.  What fun this movie is.  We watch it over and over.  It is hard to find something everyone likes, but this movie is one of them.  Well acted and so enjoyable.  Everyone needs a little Nanny McFee in their life.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This was a great sci-fi movie.  It was so cool but you need to be into Zombies a little.  Recommend this to teens.
B008RTE08E|5.0|I first saw this when I was a teenager.  I love the soundtrack.  It is a trip back in time to another era.  I watched a PBS special  on the making of this movie - which I wish I could buy - & have spent alot time in England.  This is a movie that most Americans would not realize is so English & shows how they take their holidays.  It brought back smiles to me.
B00DU74U74|5.0|If you liked Twilight you will love this too.  Wonderful storyline, great actors, amazing ideas!  I love it for sure.
B0055OMBIU|3.0|No one in my family had an interest in putting together the historical base level of the puzzle. The pieces were very very small and cut identically. Since the colors on the base are in beige and black only, it would've been very tedious - actually torture to do it.  The modern day level made of thicker foam pieces was very interesting and fun.  My 9 year old daughter stuck with it and couldn't wait to put the 3 dimensional building pieces into it.  I think it's worth it if you know you may want to omit the base level altogether and skip to the modern day level puzzle.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|What a neat concept this book has.  The storyline is of nothing else.  I think the author is creative. love
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|I figure you either like the sound or you don't. Myself, I'm on the fence, some of his tunes draw me in and envelop me, others push me away. As a musician, Mr. Mayer has almost always been sober, a blues-rock guitar wunderkind with a just above average acceptable voice.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of critics and the like telling me HOW I should feel or WHY something is good. \\"One could criticize Mayer for failing to branch out. He's established a sound for himself in the past, and instead of pushing his sound and finding new ways to innovate, he resides where he's comfortable. If that's what works for him, well then that's what works. But something can always be said about an innovator, especially one that has the ability to do so in a music industry that's slowly drifting away from the sound he's so comfortable in.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wildfire\\" is a great album opener.<br /><br />\\"Dear Marie\\" is a lot of fun and sounds different than anything John has ever done. This is a good song, a great convertible driving song, a little mellow but I like it.<br /><br />\\"Waiting On The Day\\"  I think the lyrics are perfect for what they are...BUT.<br /><br />\\"Paper Doll\\" has a great stride with smooth chops and signature picking, I love it.<br /><br />\\"Call Me The Breeze\\" \\"Cool, right?\\" JJ Cale would be proud. Love the vocals and the light touch, clean and clear.<br /><br />\\"Who You Love\\" - Ladies and Gentlemen, John Mayer's next smash? Definitely made for the airwaves. Katy Perry serves a great vocal on this one.<br /><br />\\"I Will Be Found\\" (Lost At Sea)I really like this song, but it's a little slower than the average JM song. Hmmmm what does it sound like...\\"Only Women Bleed\\"<br /><br />\\"Wildfire (II)...I enjoyed the vocal trading, the pace is great for a filler.<br /><br />\\"You're No One `Til Someone Gets You Down\\" personally this sounds too country for me.<br /><br />\\"Badge And Gun\\" flows in the classic JM style with both the vocals and instruments cascading in volume up and down, ever so smooth...mmmm nice. Makes you want to set right down around the campfire and chill.<br /><br />\\"On The Way Home\\", very melodic, steeped in nostalgic tradition, a winner!<br /><br />There's almost nothing complex about this album...there are blues, soul, maybe a hint of Bakersfield country on a cover of J. J. Cale's \\"Call Me the Breeze,\\" but not much more. I believe Mr. Mayer wants his feelings to be heard. More of a songwriter's album rather than a guitar players album. Some smooth licks abound but not to the point of giving me goosebumps.<br /><br />I read....<br /><br />\\"There's no getting around it: even people who dislike Mayer's country shift will have to admit this time that he has made an exceptional album, strong in both its lyrics and its instrumentation, with all the consistency of Continuum but less of the egoism. The difference between Continuum and Paradise, then, is that on the former Mayer makes a great album and knows it, but on the latter he makes a great album and is too humble to acknowledge it.\\"  Food for thought.<br /><br />Me, I still enjoy the old John Mayer Trio style with other great musicians like Pino Palladino on bass and Steve Jordan on drums. Now that's music!!n, ever so smooth...mmmm nice.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I love sci-fi movies and this one is just that.  Tom Cruise is an amazing actor in this movie.  Watch it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game. Gives me and my sister the perfect game to play together. Good pace and not to hard for a 6 year old!
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|This is about a different kind of world where science obviously doesn't make sense.  You need an imagination for this one.  I loved the concept.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good as book one...can't seem to get enough of this story! I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and The Hunger Games!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is awesome. I use it every day to get dressed. It is very helpful it tells you what the whether is now. How hot it is going to be. It even has weather maps. It is awesome
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season three did not end the way I thought but I love being able to watch the episodes back to back with no commercials.
B003TXSF5C|5.0|I THINK ALL OF HIS BOOKS ARE ALWAYS FASCINATING AND EDUCATIONAL AT THE SAME TIME. TRUE PAGE-TURNERS. HE IS SUCH A BRILLIANT MAN.
B0058DRUV6|4.0|Jim Collins hits a lot of our challenges in the company with the book. I have taken out the parts that makes sense to us, and we are working with this right now.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Again, really good season of Dexter!! Once I received it, the episodes went by so fast. Very difficult not to want to watch more once I started it.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|126 minutes verses 155 minutes for the director's version. The new version deserves 5 stars. If you like this movie, check \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" by the same director and make sure to watch the director's version of that movie too.<br />2 great movies for Mr. Scott<br />Highly recommended in all its aspects.
B000001EPB|5.0|This is a very special CD to me and to my relatives. Fantastic music. I love Irish music and the dance is great too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Everyone thinks it needs to update, but ive found a trick. Its called<br />NOT KNOWING WHEN THE UPDATE COMES OUT. If you search it,(when the update is)<br />Then it will say when it is supposed to come out. But on kindle, it takes longer. So<br />When you do not know when the update will &quot;supposedly&quot; come out,<br />Then it will be a pleasant surprise for you.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|THE REVIEWS DESCRIBE IT WELL, SAD, A LITTLE FUNNY, AND A LITTLE SPOOKY, STEPHEN KING COULD HAVE BEEN THE AUTHOR.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|this production is very well done, i totally enjoyed it and look forward to getting season 4. i love not having to watch commercials.
B000WBOV1G|2.0|Overacted with poor scripts and plots.  The daughter, however, is terrific.  Overall, a disappointing series.  Not worth purchasing the season.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is just amazing<br />mean it's just wow. just wow. almost everyday,I think of how hard it was for the creator of this game to create this wonderful idea!So I thank you for this. Anyway could mojang please tell me why I have to wait so long for realms? If you guys do tell<br />Me, I thank you very much.
B007Q0OV6Q|3.0|This was fine, and gave us something to do every day, but it wasn't that impressive.  After a few years with the advent calendars, the boy wasn't all that impressed with this one. It could be growing up, but he's still excited by other Lego sets. Just OK on this set after being very happy with the last few years.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to operate.  The large buttons are very nice for seeing and typing.  I will certainly recommend to friends.
0609610570|2.0|Too many information to tell me just an example.  Is a book for people who doesnt know nothing about a business. I didn't finished
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I loved tbis series of books which is a must read. it is suspenseful, & romantic. I think all the characters are interesting and likeable. Once you pick this book up you will not want to put it down until it is done. Then you will want to know what comes next. An excellent fast,& easy read.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I was late to the game on this one but I'm glad I'm catching up. Amazing storyline...great characters...I wish I had time to do a marathon but am secretly happy I'm stretching it out : )<br /><br />This is a must-see show!!!
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was just a kid, and now, my son (age 5) LOVES it.  I like it for the nostalgia and the life lessons it teaches - failure to follow simple directions can result in disaster!
B002RI97K2|4.0|I was not expecting to enjoy this book. It was a present. But I couldn't stay away from it. the characters are at best uninteresting and at worst real sleezbags; and I  don't usually use such words! Despite that, I wanted to lnow what they thought and did.and they made very interesting decisions;. I'm not going to tell you what they did, but you will finish with a lot of things to think about and some laughs and sniggers remembering what went on. Give it a go.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game..wish have the block like the phone have on it that put the color in order .for faster play all in all a fun game to play with Facebook friends.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|In my opinion Clarkson started out strong with great albums like Thankful and Breakaway-and obviously this one. But since \\"all I ever wanted\\" the music has been lacking.<br /><br />The only decent tracks being:<br />All I ever wanted:Cry,Don't let me stop you,Already gone,save you. and initially-but no longer do to overplaying-my life would suck without you and I do not hook up.<br />Stronger:Mr Know it all,dark side<br /><br />And lately-and unfortunately-Clarkson has been dabbling in faux country.Which I am a minor fan of country music but that makes me just...pissed off.Country music should not be a fad!!!<br /><br />Onto the album!!!<br /><br />Track by track:<br />Never Again-Voted most likely to get stuck in my head.But a great hit. I still remember the music video as well as the first time I heard it on the radio. 5/5<br /><br />One Minute-I used to love this song too. I still do. I just haven't pulled this CD out in years.4/5<br /><br />Hole-I can definitely relate to this song right now.Its not even funny.4/5<br /><br />Sober-First slow song on the album. Another favorite of mine,though. 3 months and I'm still sober.3 months and I'm still breathing. 5/5<br /><br />Don't Waste Your time-okay,I know I keep saying like/love/favorite. But this is probably my most favorite on this album. 5/5<br /><br />Judas-I haven't listened to this CD in ages. Yet I managed to get this song stuck in my head last week while watching an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. One with Data and Lor. An epic,biblical tale.Told in brilliant metaphor and lyrics.4/5<br /><br />Haunted-Another one I loved/still love. Where are you???I need you. DON'T LEAVE ME HERE ON MY OWN!!! 5/5<br /><br />Be Still-Sad.Slow.Beautiful.Kind of tearing up but also kind of falling asleep. 3/5<br /><br />Okay i don't remember any of the rest. So maybe..you'll get more than my opinion.<br /><br />Maybe-Boring.Repetitive.2/5<br /><br />How i feel-Another coulda been love song. from the sound of it. Don't care for it. 1/5<br /><br />Yeah-It sounds like she's trying too hard to be pat benetar or another rock great. Don't care for it at all.1/5<br /><br />Can I have a kiss-Bored. Predictable plot. Nearly as bad as a Hallmark movie. 1/5<br /><br />Irvine-Sad.slow. Semi-creepy. Are you watching me???creepy.But still rather bores me. A weak ending to the CD.2/5<br /><br />So..an overview. Tracks 1 through 7=memorable. 8 through 13, not so much.<br />Great tracks:Never Again,Sober,Don't waste your time,Haunted<br /><br />~Great tracks on first two albums~<br />Thankful:The trouble with love is,Miss Independent,Beautiful Disaster,Anytime,A Moment Like This<br />Breakaway:Breakaway,Since U Been Gone,Behind these hazel eyes,Because of you,Gone,Walk Away,You Found Me,I hate myself for losing you,hear me<br /><br />I don't expect people to rate this as helpful.But I still hope the overall message gets through.
B00459EZLW|5.0|This is a VERY high quality SCI-FYI show.  There is no need to have already watched previous Stargate shows to enjoy this one as well. The only sad thing is that MGM went broke during its run and it was shelved years too early.
B007MDB71O|4.0|This was a good sci fi / adventure film, with well-rounded characters on the most part, and a solid story , that was let down by incredibly bad marketing from disney. i did not even know the film was out and caught it on the last day of showing in the cinema.  It was different to the book's story but i liked the way they changed it, and they added a nice twist at the end. It was way better than star wars prequels, which had good marketing so did exceptionally well considering how terrible they were. Check this film out, don't listen to the idiots who write for the media.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is in my top two%. High flying, and, fast, fast,fast...... you will not be let down. It's free!!! you have a win win situation. The graphics are awesome.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|this film is total rubbish. compared to alien and aliens it is abysmal. the characters are one dimensional except for the android, they do stupid illogical things just so they can have horrible things happen to them. It is just a load of wanky, pretentious rubbish. avoid this film
B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|It was fun to see some of the old crew from lord of the rings. And it was fun to meet the new cast!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Interesting story line.  I was conflicted as to the killer.  I found the book confusing and hard to read at times.  Disappointed.
B0083EM24C|4.0|This album is all over the place. Lots of great tracks, a few weird ones. I wish I liked every song but I like most of them enough. Can't say I love the album though.
B008J34466|5.0|I do not have any negative comments to say. This album was awesome. Not only could it relate the a girl in her 30s but also a girl in her 40s! Go PINK!
B005HS00NW|4.0|There are a lot of great tracks on here, but I wish less of it was instrumental. I'm still very pleased with this purchase.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The story becomes more personal. The interest shifts from everyday activities/cases to main characters themselves. Some might not like it but that's what happens with almost any show and that's natural. More politics inside the firm. And remember when there is a gun next to your head and somebody asks you Yes or No there's bound to be a 3rd variant.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Easy Listening. I love almost every track on this album. I've been searching for a good listen for a while and this is it.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Make movie awesome book good ending very funny also crazy I thank Jeff Kinney for writing this great book thank you
B005OZE9SA|5.0|This audio recording interface is awesome, easy to install, and easy to configure, the build quality is solid like a rock, my only complaint is that headphone and monitor output levels are low when recording, but nothing to worry about it, just adjust the level in my monitors and solve it. No issues, no noise, perfect to record old vinyl discs in my hard drive.<br /><br />Spanish: Esta interface de audio para grabación es impresionante, fácil de instalar, de configurar, la calidad de construcción es sólida como una roca, mi única queja es que los niveles de salida de audífono son un poco bajos cuando se graba, pero nada de que preocuparse, es cuestión de ajustar el nivel de mis monitores y asunto arreglado, Ningún problema, no hay ruidos, es perfecta grabar viejos vinilos en mi disco duro.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits is entertaining and different than any other shows based around around a law firm. I highly recommend watching Suits.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book will some day be made into a movie, but you need to wait or they will turn it into a zombie flick.<br />You get pulled in at the beginning with a broken heart story, but you stay until the end because of the plot turns. True, there were no less than three love relationships (the most I can tolerate I  One) but the plot always takes an unexpected and exciting turn. The author does a great job of keeping three intertwined story lines going through the climax that will keep you up all night reading until the end.<br />I have downloaded Hugh Howdy' s next book expecting the same excitement.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Although there are some disturbing aspects regarding the children's orphanage experiences, this book is a great story.  Ms McKenna resolves all at the end.
B001E45XT4|4.0|got it as a gift, but i hear the person likes them so.... fgd dfg d fg df gdfd fd f
B0036S4B6M|1.0|Not very well written! Also, nothing happens. If you watch the show first you will be snarly disappointed after reading this!!!!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Don't be scared off by the \\"professional\\" reviews. This movie is great. Slightly predictable story line but one of the best sci-fi movies this year. Amazing environment and visually stunning.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved Downton Abbey Season 1....I liked Season 2 but not as much as the first season....and then Season 3 blew me away!!  Can't get enough of this show!
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I have had the Pulse for a few months now and been using it almost everyday.  It works great tracking my day's activity, sleeping seems to be 80% accurate, and pulse tracking it is a nice feature.  Taking your pulse can be a little tricky at times, often have to do it a few times before I get a reading.  I think my biggest complaint is the coating on the screen pretty quickly starts to scratch off.  The integration into the Withings app is great, especially with the Withings scale data.  Also, the new Withing webpage is much nicer then the old one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever I luv it I've been playing it forever and just can't stop!! I luv it because it makes you think about what u r going to create and how u r going to do it best game ever and keep the updates coming and soon it will be the best app on the market or app store!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun not only for myself but  for all of my family  everyone loves I think you should get it
B0047SKR54|5.0|but then, what person watching this film of their own volition wouldn't count it as a classic?<br /><br />the cinematography is fantastic; it doesn't have that grainy feel that films made at that time can have.<br /><br />the performances were stellar, of course, although, I kinda don't buy martin sheen as a threat at all; right to the end, I had to adjust to his role as a special forces assassin.  still, when he struck out to kill, his speed was impressive enough to just make the illusion hold.<br /><br />watching Laurence fishburne groove is also a treat.  watching him do mick jagger is even better!  I actually felt the loss when his character was killed.<br /><br />albert hall was great too; a poor man's Sidney poitier?<br /><br />I don't really have any objections to this movie.  the narration was unnecessary, but didn't spoil anything.
159463176X|4.0|I liked this book, although I found the introduction of so many characters in the latter half distracting.  The rythm of the book is quite lovely, and the twists of fate intriguing.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The series is as good or better than you remember because it has been remastered.  It is a lot of fun to watch.
B0036MDN80|5.0|I love this mom and baby. So, lifelike!! Cats carry their young in this manner which adds to the realness. I will buy more of the Papo animals and, if you like real looking animals,you will buy them too.
B00004YWAG|5.0|Sit back and imagine you are in the court of Carlos V of Spain!  That is exactly what this CD does, takes one back to a time of regal environs and grace.  This was the age when Spain ruled the seas and its majesty and pride is fully captured in this CD!
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Le Carre is one of the few authors I buy immediately a new book comes out.  This novel of political machinations and shameful skullduggery doesn't disappoint.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Even though the subject matter was dark, it was handled with such a deft hand.  Ultimately, I found the book very uplifting and would rate it as my favorite so far this year.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|For the price I got a few extra songs.  Bob Marley?!!  this is a no brainer!!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for an easy purchase.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|I am a Die Hard fan and have watched the previous movies in the series countless times.  In fact, the first two Die Hard movies are Christmas time staples in my home.  I was one of the movie goers who genuinely enjoyed the fourth installment, 'Live Free Die Hard.'  So, I was amongst some of the first movie goers to see 'A Good Day to Die Hard' on opening day.  Unfortunately, I was incredibly disappointed.  While the action sequences are good, the poorly developed plot and atrocious dialogue absolutely crippled the pace of the film.  When you see many people in the audience checking their watches (or phones) to look at the time 2/3rds of the way through the movie, you know it's not a good sign. IMO, the third movie, 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' was the weakest of the series... until now.  In fact, if you haven't seen 'A Good Day to Die Hard' I would highly recommend skipping it and watching 'Olympus Has Fallen' instead if you enjoyed the first two Die Hard movies.  That movie was a lot more worthy of being a Die Hard movie, than this one was.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its a good game to pass the time,  cant figure out how to use the extras that you have to unlock
B00BHMF578|4.0|Watched from Amazon Instant Video.  What an amazing story!  Movie did a good job of telling the story.  Wasn't the best acting I've ever seen (except for John Goodman and Alan Arkin), or amazing production or anything likke that, but the story is so amazing it makes the movie great.
0679720200|5.0|I was very pleased with the great condition of the book.  Also received the book before estrimated delivery date, which was good because my daughter needed to get started on her summer reading.!!!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I already said it. Nice, simple, and easy to play. Very cheap as well, which is always a plus. 5 stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game.  I'm addicted! I have to play this every night before bed.  Nothing like a classic for good clean fun.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My whole family loves this game. It is a lot of fun and very addictive. My whole family plays this game.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Great for kids and adults alike. Visually stunning. Forgot how much I loved this movie until I watched it with my kids!
B0049VZ222|5.0|I am not much of a tv watcher but I never miss an episode of The Walking Dead. I have never liked zombie movies or shows but I must say, I am now! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE The Walking Dead and can't wait for the new season.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Love the Dark Knight Trilogy, and this was a good, cheap Blue-Ray box set. Happy with everything it came with, and the art on the boxes is great too. Great Buy.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Always been a Fan of the show, to watch the complete series was really GREAT treat for me. They should make more intelligent moves like this.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|was expecting for of a story plot rather than just stripping. the stripping was sexy but, the storyline was stupid.
6305320802|5.0|This is a very fine musical.  Oldie but Goodie!
B005IDXIL2|3.0|This game does what it is advertising.  You bowl.  It is an okay game, not fantastic. Gives you something to do late at night or on road trips.
B00DDZM0GQ|1.0|Forces you to beat 5 levels to get to the next stopping point then glitches on the restart level button.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This app is simple, but the graphics are well done. The controls are very simple, but this game is surprisingly fun. You can customize your monkey through clothing and training. This is one of the games you have to try to understand how fun it is! If it wasn't free, I never would have tried it, and I would've missed out.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Hilarious!!! Way better than I thought it was going to be! Quotes from this movie dominate our conversations! Extremely well done and a good story line. Definitely suggest you get this one. Minion bonus racks are funny too.
157421327X|5.0|I recommend this book for all beginning zentanglers. I knew a little but this book is so helpful.  The instruction are clearly written and the pictures take you step by step.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|We tried several times to buy this DVD &#34;new&#34; but each one turned out to be a pirated cop that would not play in our DVD player! Finally we decided to try and buy a &#34;used&#34; copy. Not a thing wrong with the discs! One of our favorite Disney cartoons. Good story and another 'Disney Princess'! Great seller, good product.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Stunning video, superb character development, amazing writing, incredible acting. Broadchurch is one of my favorite crime dramas ever. Absolutely brilliant.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|What can I say about this one! Awesome! I saw it 4 times in the theater(s) and could not wait to watch it at home! We do not have cable at our home so we do movie night all the time and this is a favorite of all! The Hulk is great!!!!
B004DHUAZQ|1.0|This movie has got to be the stupidest and most unbelievable I have ever seen.<br />Not worth your time or money.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This is a wonderful album!  It has a variety of sounds to it.  There's a calypso beat to \\"Show Me\\", a piano ballad in \\"When I Was Your Man\\", a throw back of a big disco dance number in \\"Treasure\\", and 50's Doo Wop on \\"If I Knew\\", to name a few.  They all have a great beat and Bruno Mars is a great artist!  Two songs have explicit lyrics but only in \\"Gorilla\\" are they really noticeable.  I originally bought the album because I really liked two of the songs on it (I had not heard any of the others).  I'm quite pleased with the whole thing and I look forward to more of his releases.  This multifaceted album is definitely worth the listen and the price!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|My wife and I have a Fringe night to watch this show and enjoy it very much. It is one of our favs.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have always enjoyed Downton Abbey and season 3 stays right in line with the other seasons.  I will always be a big fan.
B004LQI0QK|5.0|This movie really made the history come alive.  Although the movie was long, it really held our attention.  We recommend it.
8675600224|5.0|Purchased this book a few years ago. The illustrations definitely makes the history within the book come alive. It transforms it from an already good read to a full blown history lesson with murder and mystery. If you are thinking about picking up a copy of the da vinci code, the illustrated version should be the first and only one to get!
B00A285OOW|5.0|I have read most of Gregory's books from this series.  This one was just as good as I was expecting.  All of them have kept me enthralled and I did not want to put them down.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|I had a free copy of a different checkers program, and this seems to compare fairly well. I don't have any problems with the app, but it didn't WOW me either, so that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't get enough of this storyline. I can't wait for more. Please tell me there will be more of this series.
B008PZZV8S|4.0|Enjoyed this movie a lot.  Matt Damon was as adept as changing himself as his character was.  Kept my attention, a little creepy, and worth the watch.
0385341008|5.0|Very good read if you get beyond the fact that it's just letters.  Some are put off with this format. Lots of little tid bits that were great.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Keeping this short and sweet: I've never enjoyed a John Mayer album as much at first listen as Paradise Valley. Every song set its hook the first time through. Classic John Mayer with even more freshness and maturity. This one's going to dominate my playlist for a long while to come!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OK. So there is a lot of sex, etc. but if lit's too much, just glance over it. Read all three books. There really is a good well-written story in all of this.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A very interesting perspective into not only the life of a Navy Seal but his family during his deployments and career in the Navy. This was an entertaining and educational story. Kyle was a true American hero and this and the world lost a great man!
B0017VQB40|5.0|Beautifully done.  I could watch it again an again.  Actually, I probably will. Natalie Wood does an amazing job overall
B005544TRQ|5.0|One of the best legal shows. Drama and comedy rolled into one.  Hilariously funny and very enjoyable.  A must watch.
B005DOKK7Q|4.0|I didn't realize it was a just a sleeve, I was looking for something that I can keep the Kindle in while using it too. But it is very sleek looking.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I really didn't like this game at first because while it is similar to Bejeweled, it was different enough to be confusing when swapping from game to game. Once I got used to the mechanics, it got kind of addictive. I beat the game months ago and still go in and play. It's quite entertaining.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|This was a decent sci-fi flick for entertainment value.  I enjoyed it, until the end.  The &#34;twist&#34; was a real twist, but the explanation for what happened and who did it was kind of out of place for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Tom Cruise was his usual action hero self, and I would recommend this movie if you're into sci fi as a whole, and don't care if the end makes &#34;sense&#34; or not.
B00881PTRC|2.0|I was an English major in college. I consider myself well read and I have an above average vocabulary. I'd never heard of some of these words. It made the game too difficult to be enjoyable.
B0094M6A18|5.0|This movie was suggested by a friend, and we watched it over dinner and I laughed a lot.  It was kind of violent, and kind of over the top on some parts, but like all of Del Toro's films, a great film to watch.<br /><br />If you like violent crazy humor, you'll love this movie :-)
B002ZG997M|5.0|My favorite movie, havent seen it since 2009, i watched it twice a day for 3 days then we had to return it. I plan on finally buying it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Really a great game especially when its free, the upgrade made it a bonus. I have been playing this game for almost a year.
0385349947|4.0|I was impressed by the price i got this book for, the pages aren't quite as nicely put together as text books and things but it doesnt fall apart and i was happy to pay less for it!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It works great with the PowerFast for Accelerated Charging. When my Kindle fire is letting it charge. My  Fire still has the same problem off and on with not wanting to charge. It works better if I shut the Fire off before plugging in the charger.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Over all i enjoyed the show.  I became somewhat tired of Claire Danes character being so hyper only to understand why at the end of the series.  I have come to conclusion that we need to examine our liberal laws of allowing anyone to enter and live in  the USA!!
B006WWUDGQ|5.0|one of my favorite CD's so far! Absolute loved it and would recommend it to anyone. In fact I did!
0545128285|5.0|This book is perfect for your little witches, and wizard's! lol Okay okay! It is perfect for Harry Potter fans! The Tales of Beedle the Bard is the book Dumbledore left to Hermione after his death in the Deathly Hallows part 1. The tales in this book are very enjoyable, and there are also notes written by Dumbledore after each tale. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I do!
B0084IG8TM|3.0|after all the good vibes about this movie being midieval, l found this movie unsettling regarding our present and future. what are the possibilities of mankind  concluding to this type of society in the future? in the present, we live in a society where we see our standard of living being compromise by the fortune of GDP that widens the gap between the rich, the middleclass and the poor....greed breed fat cats, power, narcissism and ultimately slavery....who said history does not repeat!!!
B003CRM6QO|5.0|Sit down and enjoy the 80's, its a must have movie night. After watching this you MUST see &#34;Ted&#34;.. You will laugh your butt off!!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This reminds me of the Killing but not as dark.  The characters are developing well and it is esy to get caught up.  I had to stop watching The Killing because everything was dark!
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|This movie has a great twist to the fairy tail. Full of action and special effects. I enjoyed every minute.
B007X709PE|5.0|Never much into moto racing but now I'm a fan and can't get enough.  This a great documentary with most of the film centered around faster than you can think footage of 200mph superbikes.  Ewan McGregor knows his stuff (see/read 'Long Way Round') and you can hear his enthusiasm in the narration.  There aren't enough moto movies out there like this..... watch 'Faster' also!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really love this game!!! It is so much fun. I really like the minions they always make me laugh
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I'm a HUGE Big Fish Game player  and I think this is  one of the cutest game they've every made!!!!
B00ECUARO8|1.0|Story is slow and drags on, just when you think it will pick up they take the straight road and keep on losing viewer interest.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I downloaded this game simply because it was free. I am truly shocked at how much I'm actually enjoying it. It's very thought provoking. Not for the empty headed. You really have to pay attention. love it.
B00A7H2NC4|5.0|Gritty and dark and not subtle in the least. The lack of color and the use of shadow go a long way in capturing the mood.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is as if I stepped back into the past and want to bring back all of the decorum, class and dignity with me. This show is definitely a favorite.  I can't wait to see season 4!!
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|This CD is part of my colection now! I can not wait to the cd arrives to the music store in Venezuela, so I have it now!!!!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I wanted to know more about Nikola Tesla, and this book was a fun, fact filled, read that gives you a great overview of his life, trials, and successes.
0345423496|4.0|Lords of the galaxy rove at will as energy with no body restraints.  Never human they did seek fellowship in the stars with the power they possessed.  They encountered life throughout the worlds and watched the faint sparks of intelligence die in the great cosmos.  Planting life they valued mind above all.  They reaped and weeded life forms dispassionately.  Ages had passed as they returned to earth they began to study, catalogue and modify the destiny of life forms.  Now they set goals of their own, not being immune to the corruptions of time they use memory.  Their indifference through science may exclude plans for a future.  This well written classic book endures time and steps into the future with striking insight.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This was a great movie for anyone age 9 to probably 79. We love fat Amy the best. She's a little bit of all of us.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I think this album will be under-appreciated and underrated, but it really shouldn't be. Every track has something to offer. Born & Raised marked a new direction for Mayer, and this album continues on that new journey into ultra-chill folk-rock that your insides are craving.<br /><br />I think Paradise Valley will be his \\"Nashville Skyline,\\" in that it will be an exceptional album that fans will truly dig, while it may not top \\"Continuum\\" in the charts. All in all, this is one of my favorite albums that Mayer has put together.<br /><br />If you're a Mayer fan, you've probably already decided to check it out. If you're not, or you've fallen out of touch with his music since \\"Continuum,\\" I would whole-heartedly recommend this one for you. Relax and enjoy the music.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Easy read about a teen's bout with cancer and her journey to make friends and have an adventure before she dies.<br />The story also appreciates literature and wittiness among teens who are facing tough challenges.<br />While this is NOT a depressing story, you may need a tissue at the end.  Ages 14 and up
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This is an especially  fun game.  The controls and strategy  are responsive and easy to learn.  Just get in the ring and punch away.  You will make fast progress.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Game contains a lot of puzzles from easy to difficult,  it allows skipping if it gets to frustrating.  Even the hidden object can be tricky the interpretation of the clues is not always what first comes to mind.  BFG please do lots more like this.
B004UPAN6W|3.0|The plot isn't bad, a little thin, but it works well enough to tell the general public about Wolverine's start in life.  Hugh Jackman still can pull off a great comic book hero after all these years.<br /><br />Everyone knows the complaints about Deadpool, we'll just skip over that.  I'm even okay if Victor Creed and Sabretooth are two different mutants with similar powers in the movieverse.  I was mostly disappointed with the special effects in the movie.  The motorcycle jump at the helicopter and the spoiler face at the end of the movie where just plain badly done.  I think anyone that is a fan of the other movies can skip it unless they really need a mutant fix.
0321811984|4.0|Very good points are made in the text that are super helpful! Must realize not everything is applicable but really gets your creative mind working improving your presentation skills, especially in the work place.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game is pretty good. It's hard to figure out a few things but over all I enjoyed the game. It could use a devise to give you hints. I just checked on YouTube for a cheat code.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|There are several versions of Emma but this one blows the others away!  Romola Garai [Amazing Grace] is one of my favorites! If you love British Period drama then this is time well spent.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|I haven't bought a cd in a long time but this one was worth getting. It's awesome.. . . ..
0679805273|5.0|Got this for my sons Navy graduation. Can't wait to give it to him. NO words left. It is perfect.
B001KT6JPA|3.0|i like the actors in hannibal, but i wasn't crazy about the story. it was not bad, but not great.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|many options to choose! And I can even flip over the car and keep driving! My daughter takes the drive too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i'm addicted to downton abbey so i was relieved & elated, like any good addict, to find season 3 on here. i love this show. it's solid.
0763644765|5.0|My 2 year old is starting to potty train, and we love the positive tone of this book. The illustrations are really cute, and my son requests it over and over.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Top notch acting and unbelievable soundtrack are just the beginning of what is so right about this movie. The directors choice of composition in this film are what set it apart from many others. Showing the stark contrast of peoples lives and how they all intertwine with the smallest of similarities. Most of which is the message of addiction, in any form, and how lives can be destroyed by such things.<br />This film is dark, I mean really dark and not for the timid viewer. When it was all over my jaw was still on the floor, and I felt like I needed a shower to feel clean again.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|LOVE this book. I only wish the movie had stayed with the novel more. But I highly, highly recommend this novel.
B005VPRETE|5.0|her Lego friends collection.  This treehouse was a perfect addition to the collection.  And the sale price was very good.
B005F2BBLK|4.0|Excellent movie.  The entertainment is for adult as well as children.  There are subtle jokes that are for mature individuals which helps when the adult is trying to enjoy something that is directed for children.  I prefer this to the Shrek movies.  Those movies are directed toward a more mature audience.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game me and my son play together. Really awesome for different game then temple run.  Definitely would recommend.
B00AG297GK|2.0|I try to maintain an open mind about the expression of humor in each individual comedienne but Borat is to far to the right for me.  I am sure he has a large following but rest assure I am not among them.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|This thing works like a dream except in reality. I just saw Kick Ass 2 tonight and it was a pretty good sequel. Super dark though, you guys.
B005ZUR724|3.0|The gameplay is pretty good, but be warned the game has issues with getting updates to the Kindle.  Sometimes you're locked out for weeks waiting for the game to be approved for release to the device.
0060007737|3.0|This book is for you if you are an american, have traditional american values and have your mind set on being the biggest and best in whatever category you have your mind set on.<br />This book is probably not the best choice (even if it still can bring a lot of insight) if your main goal is to succeed in Europe or Asia.<br />This book is definitely not for you if your aim is to set up a smaller business, whit strong core values, but with limited expansion and no plans on overtaken who ever is the leading brand in the same category as your company.<br /><br />Pros:<br />There is no doubt that the authors are very experienced and knowledgeable in the field. The plethora of examples alone in the book speak for them self.<br />There are a lot of examples, numbers of revenue and profits, details, etc. That are quite interesting.<br />There are a lot of historical examples from business ventures in the 80:s or 90:s that are also really interesting.<br />The book do make some valid points.<br /><br />Cons:<br />In 2013 the book feels somewhat outdated, even if a lot of the advice is universal and not so affected by the passing of time. But it feels kind of funny having the authors criticize Apple for making both software (the IOS) and hardware (the mac, iPhone etc), and drawing the scenery for Apples slow death as a consequence by this move. \\"Do Microsoft make HW? No it's a SW brand! Do Dell make SW? Of course not, it's a HW brand!\\". Anyone heard of the iPhone, iPod, iPad? All products with SW and HW from Apple. Did not do to badly as a company/brand move now did it?<br />Yahoo! is also pointed out as the genius be all take all brand of the internet age, but again it's funny there is absolutely no mentioning of Google?..<br />Predicting the future is very hard and I can not really blame the authors for not getting everything right, but it does make you wonder; Are those laws really as immutable as they want to claim?<br /><br />The book feels VERY american. If you are notfamiliar with Dominos pizza, Sears, Staples etc. A lot of the examples kind of loses their value.<br />The book is VERY brand focused. This might not be a surprise put the book deals with brands as the only thing of importance. The actual product does not matter. This is a bit of a pitty because one important aspect of branding that I was hoping to gain some insight into was how to connect a product to a brand.<br />And when the book suggest that everyone else is really as brand orientated as the authors by claiming that as soon as someone comes up with a good whine brand then this brand will take over the whine market as Coca Cola did with sodas and Budweiser did with beers, it gets almost laughable. But this is also a very american stand point. As a European a was really surprised of all the food chains in the US. I think that a pretty common belief in a large part of Europe is that you go to a restaurant because of the chef, the restaurants reputation and the atmosphere. Of course I also go to McDonalds on occasions, but not because of the food, it's because it's convenient and fast. But I would never go to a chain restaurant if I had the choice and time to eat at a real family restaurant. But how do I brand a single family restaurant? I do not know, and this book has no information on this topic. Even though the most famous restaurants in the world have very strong brand names and are not part of some global chain of restaurants.<br /><br />The worst thing for me about this book is that it only focus on big brands. The leaders in every category.<br />To sum the book up:<br />Make sure your the first in your category.<br />Make sure your the leader in that category.<br />Make sure to tell your customers that your the leader in the category.<br />Once you reach this point, make sure to not change anything about your branding strategy.<br /><br />There it is (should maybe have put a warning for spoilers) now you do not need to read the book.<br />But what if I donot seek ultimate world dominion? What if my aim is not to be the new Coca-Cola company. Can I not still benefit from a strong brand image? Of course I can, but I will not find any information on how to do so in this book!
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|Definitely not as good as the original.but it's still pretty awesome.<br />I most definitely recommend watching this movie.beware of the necronomicon.
B000002J0P|5.0|Good to hear this again after many years since it bought it when it first came out. In excellent condition.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|The product accomplishes its mission. Since I bought it I have been using constantly and I notice the pictures I have been taking with it are nicer.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite Beatles albums. Their music never gets old. I originally bought this album back in 1969 when it first came out. Great to be able to hear these songs again.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This was such an inspirational story. I am so happy for James and Bob that they found each other.<br />There is nothing more special than the love of cat!!!
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors music is full of energy and has always represented the desire for freedom. This collection has some of their best songs. One of the best of the 60's bands.
B002BVOYBW|5.0|Fun loving, friendship building story of compassion and love between a brother and sister and the people around them helping them through the dance of life.  Delightful.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|It is checkers, what's not to like? Works very well and fun to play even with other people with multiplayer
1595827684|5.0|This is a great piece for fans of the franchise. Not only does it show many different characters and places from the game, there is also tons of concept art and development. You can see how some of your favorite characters were imagined and developed.<br /><br />I do not own any of the other art books, so I cannot compare this item to the others. I am very happy with this book. I feel like the art was a huge part of why Mass Effect was so successful and this book pays tribute to that!
B00BZB1ME6|5.0|This movie is an obvious classic and an essential part to any kids childhood. It has warmth, friendliness and humor that really wrap you up into the story line and will continue to pull you in again and again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As the story continued, there was a deepening and maturing of the characters.  The viewer cares, more and more, for the characters , and sees their deepening regard for each other.  The war causes changes in the rigidity of the social classes, and the series does a great job of depicting how the process of change is both difficult and hopeful.  I found this season to be even more engrossing than Season 1.
0439875889|5.0|Love reading this book to my daughter, my preschoolers were able to pick up the rhymes and interact very quickly. I only wish I was able to find it in hardcover/board book.
159463176X|2.0|I was disappointed in this book..  It was all over the place.. too many subplots.  Not his best.  I found it confusing
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|Not as good as the original, but it was okay. The story remains essentially the same, but the slickness of the special effects distracted from it.<br /><br />As far as the play on Amazon went, it was fine. No skips, lag or interrupts. I enjoy renting videos from Amazon and watching them at home.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Excellent. Good buy, fast service. Would do this again. DVD is for my grand daughter. She loves it. Easy to complete deal
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The Pendergast series has been exciting to read but it´s always been hard to wait for the next book.  I hope there will be another one!  If not, I still love the Preston/Child collaborations, and will continue to search for any I haven't read yet.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Just discoverd amazon and the first book I purchased Defending Jacob is really good. Hope the next book I buy is this good. Absolutely love amazon just my prime membership ended
B005ZUR724|5.0|I give this 5 stars for many reasons. One, its kept me playing for a whole year. Two, No more monthly fees. Three, Its soooooo much fun.<br /><br />There are still some sloght bugs with the game such as quests being broken, but it is only few. Also the servers CAN be slightly laggy at times. *Note this is only for kindle fire* Also the game is connected to the entire android server network, so you can play with many people.<br /><br />The whole game runs very well, and is VERY VERY fun! There are 4 classes and 5 races. Orc and Undead for chaos. Mendel is neutral. Human and elf for order. The 4 classes are Ranger, Warrior, Mage and Monk. Each class has 2 paths you can take. Ranger has archer and assassin. Warrior has gaurdian and tank. Mage has permafrost and skyfire. Monk has military and divine. This game has top notch graphics for a kindle and keeps you playing for a loooooonng time!<br /><br />If you get the game, im on the Arcadian Forest server and my char. name is iGeo. Look for me and ill help you out!<br /><br />I highly recommend you buy this and share this info with friends! Lets grow the community! Thanks!<br /><br />-iGeo
B0063IH60K|3.0|It is a okay game. I have played better solitare on other game systems. It was free so I guess it is worth it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game to me when I first tried it didn't appeal to me.But once I downloaded it again i was addicted to it! :D Great art on there the dragons are so cute and epic looking!Easy controls.A little bit pricey on some things but I still love this game!Highly recommended to people that like dragons and games where you raise and make you  own park! (Like dragonvale )
B0067R0APK|3.0|I like this app for the most part. The forecasting is pretty good. The biggest problem that I have is that the radar maps don't work. all I've ever gotten is a blank screen with the legend at the top.
0132350882|5.0|Definitely I think there is a before and after this book. Other than that is funny and well explained. .
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|KMy favorite series in Si-Fi if you saw the film and didn't get it, read the book. Then the film is much more enjoyable.
0374158460|5.0|This is the best novel I have ever read.  Period.<br />From the reviews it sounds like it was a slog for most people.  Sorry to hear.  It is a bit too long.  The trip Latin America was too much of a diversion.  And for the Victorian crowd, there is a lot of vulgarity, perhaps even more than needed to make a point.<br /><br />I had plenty of head scratching about why this novel is called \\"Freedom.\\"  But it hit me about 1/3 of the way through.  This novel is about the effects of our fixation on freedom in the good 'ol U.S. of A.  It's a study of oxymorons where an environmentalist promotes strip mining, a liberal falls in love with a Republican, and the idyllic middle-class, Midwestern family is anything but, all because they have the freedom to become very messed up.<br /><br />My guess is that Mr. Franzen was influenced by a certain president of a few years back who would use the term \\"freedom\\" about 50 times in a speech.  No Iraq war in this all-American book however.  He has built a fantastical but amazingly realistic world where the characters are incredibly well-constructed.  They don't talk about freedom; they live it in a subtle but spine twisting sort of way.  Perhaps it's worth a second read to find the parable for our country as a whole...<br /><br />Read it for the plot.  Become transfixed by the theme.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I liked the storyline but the movie itself was a snoozer in places. Glad I didn't pay 10.00 to see it in the theater!
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|Through the whole movie I felt I was supposed to be holding a game controller. Good thing it was cheap rental because I would have felt cheated if I had bought it.
0064430227|5.0|The fact that there is a 50th anniversary edition says that Harold is still drawing with his purple crayon.  This is a wonderful book, not only for children, but can serve as a metaphorical lesson for adults as well.
1616550414|5.0|I'm a Zelda fan for a life<br />got the Japanese version first, the exact thing<br />except it's bigger. Translation is great<br />super complete, lot's of concepts arts and cool facts of all the games<br />highly recommended, essential book
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Love the mystery but little creeped out by the big brother / human engineering aspect.  Interested to see where else they take me.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This series has lots of real science and theoretical science in it. The writers have created wonderful and comic crises that the town must be rescued from. The characters are believable and easy to become ones you will care about. Watching the series in order helps follow the interaction of the players and become more involved in the program. Try it, you'll like it.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|I have purchased more copies of this book and sent it to more clients than any in recent memory.  Like Gladwell an Pink, Adam whacks us by the side of the head and -- warmly and with wit -- invites us to create a new frame for looking at our world(s) . . . personally and professionally.
0143039431|5.0|I ordered the book for research purpose for my school. And it proved be an excellent source of research. Despite the long chapter, it is overall amazing.
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|In the past year I've purchased nearly two dozen figures manufactured by Schleich, Papo-France and Safari LTD. One (a unicorn) will go to my 5 year old granddaughter at Christmas but the rest stay with me for now, and I only let my grandchildren (the other one is a 3 year old boy) play with them when I'm also playing with them, so I can supervise. And this is because all of these fine figures are fairly high quality, relatively breakable, collectible figures (and because my grandson is, well, a boy who loves to find out how things go together by taking them apart, even if they aren't meant to be taken apart...). It's also because I'm 61 going on 11 or something like that, but someday I'll pass them on to the grandkids.<br /><br />Schleich is a German company, though its figures, including this one, are manufactured in China (as are Papo and Safari figures). Of the three companies (Schleich, Papo and Safari), Schleich's figures are, I would say, the most sophisticated, in terms of style, design and overall quality (though I consider Papo and Safari figures to be very high quality as well).<br /><br />I've uploaded 9 photos of the Dragon Rider to this page that will hopefully give you a sense of just how detailed and carefully and well painted this figure is. To get an overall sense of Schleich figures in general I recommend that you visit their website.<br /><br />This figure weighs about 1.25 lbs. and measures about 15\\" from wingtip to wingtip (when the wings are maximally spread) and about 11\\" from snout to the end of the armored, weaponized tail (see my photo of the tail to see what I mean by \\"weaponized\\"). The knight himself is 4\\" tall, which puts him in the same size range as most other Schleich as well as Papo and Safari figures. The dragon is larger than the two Papo dragons I own (the Dragon of Darkness that I reference below as well as the [[ASIN:B0036MDNV2 Papo Two Headed Dragon Gold]]), enough so that one might think of the Schleich Dragon Rider dragon as an adult dragon alongside a pair of adolescent dragons.<br /><br />The wings can be moved around as they rotate in sockets, and in fact when I received the Dragon Rider one of the wings was out of the socket but it easily popped back in. The knight is magnetized in such a way that when you place him on the saddle on the dragon's back, he hangs on. I can compare this to the [[ASIN:B001LMU7V8 Knight with a Triple Battle Axe]] from Papo, who is designed to sit astride Papo's saddled [[ASIN:B001LJXKWY Dragon of Darkness]]. Because the Knight with a Triple Battle Axe is not magnetized, he tends to sit loosely on his dragon, which means that he tends to fall off when my grandchildren (and/or their grandfather) play with this knight/dragon combo. In contrast, the magnetized Dragon Rider knight stays in place when he's in the saddle. By the way, while the dragon has movable wings, the only movable part on the knight is the spear in his right hand, and that can really only be rotated; if I were to move the spear forward or backward in his hand I'd have to force it, and I think that might cause some damage to the figure.<br /><br />If you are considering buying this as a gift for a child who will play with it unsupervised, keep in mind that it has parts that can easily be broken off or that can break if the figure is played with roughly. It might survive a few falls onto a hard surface but I wouldn't want to chance it. My 3 year old grandson (who is admittedly too young to be given a toy like this for unsupervised play) would have the spear broken from the knight's hand in no time. When I was a child in the 1950's and 1960's growing up in Manhattan, my friends and I would do things with toy army men that I shudder to imagine a child doing with Schleich, Papo or Safari figures. E.g., we'd tie strings on them and drag them under the wheels of automobiles as they crawled up our one-way street; we'd set them on fire so we could watch blobs of melting plastic zip down to the sidewalk; we'd blow them up with firecrackers, ashcans and cherry bombs (very foolish behavior in retrospect!); we'd throw them off the roofs of our tenement buildings; we'd stomp them; we'd bury them in the tiny patch of earth behind my building and sometimes leave them buried through a whole NY winter; etc. If you want to buy a gift for a child who might be inclined to \\"play\\" with toys in such a manner, or in any rough manner, find something cheaper and more disposable than this fine figure.<br /><br />This is a great figure to be put on display, which is how I will use it when I am not using it for supervised play with my grandchildren.<br /><br />Among the many good qualities of this figure is that it is timeless, in the sense that it is not tied into a specific movie or comic book or movie or comic book characters or anything less timeless than knights and dragons.<br /><br />Lastly, what about the price? As of this date, based on my familiarity with similar figures (again, by Schleich, Papo and Safari), I would say that if one can get this figure for under $35 with shipping and handling included in that price, that's a fair deal. It is definitely a high quality figure (so much so that I hesitate to call it a toy).<br /><br />I'm very impressed with this figure. I rate it 5 stars overall, including for \\"educational value\\" simply because of the fact that it and similar kinds of figures can spark the imaginations of the young and the young at heart. I rate it 5 stars for durability as well, despite my comments about how easily it could be damaged if played with roughly, because it is durable not as a toy made to be played roughly with, but as a high quality figure made to be treated with a certain amount of care and respect.alk; we'd blow them up with firecrackers, ashcans and cherry bombs (very foolish behavior in retrospect!); we'd throw them off the roofs of our tenement buildings; we'd stomp them; we'd bury them in the tiny patch of earth behind my building and sometimes leave them buried through a whole NY winter; etc. If you want to buy a gift for a child who might be inclined to \\"play\\" with toys in such a manner, or in any rough manner, find something cheaper and more disposable than this fine figure.<br /><br />This is a great figure to be put on display, which is how I will use it when I am not using it for supervised play with my grandchildren.<br /><br />Among the many good qualities of this figure is that it is timeless, in the sense that it is not tied into a specific movie or comic book or movie or comic book characters or anything less timeless than knights and dragons.<br /><br />Lastly, what about the price?

B009HUB40Y|1.0|If you enjoy being hounded to buy all sorts of extra stuff and being badgered to log on to Facebook between every short level then this is the game for you. After a few minutes of play you are expected to PAY to play a few more levels.  I can't understand why anyone would play this when there are so many other, BETTER free games of this type that don't hassle you non stop.  The game itself is average, not even close in quality to the free games DRAGON GEMS and JEWEL STAR, and you will not see the outrageous pandering for money on those games.  This is the most obnoxious ad infested &quot;free&quot; game I have ever encounterd.  Can't understand the high rating unless people just don't know any better.  Avoid this ad producing Facebook badgering mess at all costs!
B0083Z614S|5.0|Read all of it in a few hours. Loved the story. Recommended to my grandchildren. Better than contemporary stuff available nowadays!
B000VK99Z6|4.0|You will enjoy this movie from the people who made Sean Of The Dead.  I begins slowly but ends up very funny.
B001MTENOC|4.0|I'm not religious but I do believe in a higher power. This book confirmed my already established belief system in life after death. I found his cases interesting and Dr. Newton a thoughtful writer.<br /><br />If you've ever been curious about the other side, this is a good book to read.
0756666937|5.0|This book is everything it's supposed to be. My son and I have spent countless hours looking at and we continue to do so.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I loved this app! It was great...for a little while. I upgraded it and everything, and I was 100% happy with it. Until today. Whenever I try to open it, it just says &quot;vTube has stopped&quot;. I called Amazon and everything, and I got it up...for about 5 seconds. And it stopped again. I tried everything, but nothing worked. Very nice quality! I would happily pay for it if they worked that bug out.
B00A18KCSQ|5.0|Picked this up after the concert back in April.  I had seen them before several years back at the Treasure Island Fest, and enjoyed them, but not enough to spring for the CD.  However, that show was fantastic, and this CD is amazing.  I've easily listened to it more than anything else in my collection in the past 4 months, and it has been in constant rotation.  Really wonderful.
B005544V6A|5.0|Now I see what all the fuss is about.  I've always loved Gabriel Macht and Patrick Adams is a great newcomer.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love being able to play with friends, I love being able to play with new people, getting new cards if needed. It's fun fun fun!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Although I knew what happened this season, watching it was especially gripping...the emotions, etc.  It was truly a great season.
140006922X|5.0|This book is well written and documented. Finally what really happened ! I  still believe in Jesus and his teachings,but he is not the son of God. He Himself has stated.&quot;I am the son of man&quot;.
B001NA6096|5.0|Smart text. Bold characters.  Beautiful scenery and a very romantic plot. Watching this movie helped to understand next two movies of the same director.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I am using the free portion of the app. I control my desktop with my kindle while lounging on the couch downstairs (access within my home wireless network). The setup was really easy, dl app on kindle, dl program on desktop, sign in and then watch my desktop's movies, stream video, and watch flash content to my hearts content. Drawbacks: my small kindle (7\\" fire) makes my desktop (24\\") small and hard to read and tap, but the pinch zoom function helps with this. Programs that require full screen don't work yet. Also, if my desktop goes into sleep mode the app can't wake it up so I have to walk upstairs. Alas, my poor legs. This app crams alot more functionality into my kindle for free, 5 stars!
B005544V6A|3.0|It is entertaining but not very sophisticated. Plots are simplistic and very predictable. Characters are very stereotypical, while the whole idea is far from being realistic.
1936719118|5.0|In a collection of his quintessential wisdom throughout the ages Derek distills many useful perspectives from his long career. From the Brilliant &#34;Hell yeah or hell no&#34; to &#34;Execution is the multiplier to ideas&#34; he writes something I wish I had read in grade school. A very useful book and quite pleasant to read. A must for people like good outcomes.
B008BQ8VOC|3.0|It is entertaining but not very sophisticated. Plots are simplistic and very predictable. Characters are very stereotypical, while the whole idea is far from being realistic.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|I felt that Skyfall was the worst of the 3 Latest Bond films. Javier Barden is a great actor but I feel that Sam Mendes did a poor job of developing his character, but it is worth watching. Roger Deacons is my fav DP and he did another brilliant job shooting this one, and its wirth watching for his cinematography.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|Interesting text but not as sharp as in the first movie. Familiar characters.  Beautiful city but somewhat predictable plot. Watching this movie helped to understand next move in this sequel .
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Disney Studios 14th full length animated feature film is another fan favorite. Peter Pan is another enduring classic released at the height of the studios resurgence. The last film of the heavily influenced Mary Blair years. The colors pop even more on this sparkling Blu Ray treatment and there are some excellent bonus features on this set. Considering this is the 4th release on home video in fairly recent years there was no reason to lose any bonus features in the place of others here. The film is presented in its original theatrical fomat (full screen).<br /><br />Still the film has never looked or sounded better and there are some quality bonus features on this set. Overall this is a very satisfying release. The story is simple, the characters (Tinker Bell is a standout!)and songs are memorable. It's no wonder this is a fan favorite and had stood the test of time.<br /><br />If you don't own any edition, then the Blu Ray is by far the best choice.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend but had listened to all the cuts on the album and its one of her best!
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|For their third recording, the Tedeschi Trucks Band have developed a sound all their own that only comes from musicians playing together as a true collective-everyone shares the same musical goal and the song is more important than the individual participants.<br /><br />The band's 2011 release, \\"Revelator\\" was an introduction of the combined efforts of the Susan Tedeschi and Derek Truck's bands, at one time known as the Soul Stew revival. Songwriting was the key, and the band delivered with original, quality compositions.Last year's \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\" captured the group in jam band mode and every member-ELEVEN musicians-were featured on this double disc, especially Susan and Derek sharing guitar duties. \\"Made Up Mind\\" shows a band with more confidence, more comfortable as the leading contemporary soul/blues/rock band performing today.<br /><br />The title track jumps out with Derek's driving guitar. Susan has shown unmatched growth as a lead vocalist over the years. When she started out, comparisons were made to Bonnie Raitt. This is a good thing, of course, but Susan has been showing her early start with Gospel. As a child, she attended African-American Baptist churches and sang in the Gospel choir at the Berklee College of Music. You can't help but BELIEVE her when she sings \\"sure as the moon and the stars gonna rise, I've got a made up mind\\".<br /><br />\\"Idle Wind\\" is quite a departure for the group. Susan again is featured with a beautiful vocal, but the interplay between Derek's slide and Kofi Burbridge's flute is unexpected-and engaging. Burbridge is also featured on clavinet and B3 on \\"Misunderstood\\", while the dual drums of J.J. Johnson and Tyler Greenwell drive the band. The horn section of Kebbie Williams/saxophone, Maurice Brown/trumpet and Saunders Sermons/trombone elevate the vocals of Mike Mattison and Mark Rivers. Trombonist Sermons is also a superb vocalist and duets with Susan on \\"Part Of Me\\".<br /><br />The TTB has to feature some jamming, so we're treated to Susan and Derek burning it up on \\"Whiskey Legs\\". The feel good vibe from this tune abruptly changes with \\"It's So Heavy\\". Although a somber tune, the playing is lovely, especially Susan's pleading vocal enhanced by Derek's guitar.<br /><br />\\"The Storm\\" is a work out for Derek and Kofi Burbridge on B3 (clever wordplay on this number at its conclusion). Bassist Oteil Burbridge, younger brother of Kofi was a founding member of TTB (as well as a member of the Allman Brothers Band); he left the band in October 2012 for family reasons. Four bass players were recruited for this project, and half of the tracks feature Pino Palladino, one of the premier in-demand players today (check out his sublime bass on \\"The Storm\\" as well as \\"Made Up Mind\\" and \\"Heavy\\".<br /><br />The last track is the sparse, acoustic \\"Calling Out To You\\". Derek plays a soft slide and very gentle chords while Susan puts down one of her best vocals on record. This track, more than anything the two have recorded before, sums up what they're all about. These are two like-minded musicians who have managed to live happily in private AND in the spotlight, raise children, make great music and welcome their fans to enjoy the ride with them. \\"You got to do right by your woman and she'll do right by you.\\" Ain't it the truth.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun, entertaining, fast paced and ties in well with the Despicable Me 2 movie.  Great fun for all ages.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I downloaded this at the recommendation of a friend. I enjoyed the gameplay, but really thought the graphics could have been better. Addicting so watch out
B007N85POS|4.0|It's Angry Birds, so it rocks.  It comes in handy for those long trips in the car when the kids need something to do.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Good way to destress after work because not a lot of thought is needed to play this game unless you are trying to quickly advance levels.
B002APU580|5.0|The characters of Pride and Prejudice are well cast in this film.  Viewing the film caused me to go back and reread Pride and Prejudice after too many years.  Then, what a treat to find all the variations on the Pride and Prejudice storyline, allowing a continued acquaintance with all the beloved characters and their lives.
B00DNO3HXC|5.0|I love everything about this movie. The cinematography, the casting, the acting...all of it. Albeit a love story, it's different than the norm.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Those who believe every word in the Bible may not care for it but it has actually served to broaden my Christian faith.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|when I saw the ad for this movie when it was released I didnt have high hopes, however it is great!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Even Though it is a nice game, it takes a huge amount to time to load and run. rest seems alright
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game whenever my friends come over we take turns playing things s games I would recommend getting this game
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|This file never worked for me and I had the same problem with the book. Boo. Sat on a plane with no movie to watch!
B00821OX98|5.0|Loved the story the acting the action. Could have easily been cheesy but wasn't. It was one part terminator flash back and two parts walking dead.
B00006D295|5.0|Its a classic of course and a great buy.  My daughter loves watching it with me and the sound track.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Better than the hbo series! Treason, betrayal, murder, and plotting. Cannot wait to have some final closure that ties life into conclusion.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This is my second time picking up this product. Honestly the first time, I was a bit skeptical of what it could do, but I was soon proven wrong. I had, at the time, had 3 computers that were overheating quickly. So i read online that the CPU grease could dry out over time. The computers were older, and after opening them up, I quickly learned that they needed new grease. I bought my first tube, used only maybe 1/8th of it, and left it with a friend when I moved. Bought a second tube for my new tower, and followed all the instructions on the main site for this product. My computer is running cooler now, even in the hottest environments. I highly recommend a person picking this up for either repairs or initial installs.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Best written book I've read in years. Can't wait to read more from Max Brooks. One of my new favorite authors.
B009X01FJS|5.0|I love this case for my Kindle Fire HD!  The case is a perfect fit for my Kindle and since I am constantly bringing my Kindle with me to work I like the added protection.  The case is exactly as described and the rotation works very well, and I use it quiet often since some games are only oriented one way and I like to read ebooks vertically.  The notches work well to hold the Kindle either horizontal or vertical.  I will be honest and I have dropped my Kindle a couple of times and thankfully the case has done its job of protecting it!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|The game is a really fun game to play but the amount of coins a gems it takes to buy a pet or house is so expensive it's crazy!!!! Like the lady bug I think they cost like 800'000 coins ridiculous!!!! Also with the gems but not that much like a animal will cost like 24 gems it's really hard to earn gems. And it's really wierd that I can't play the daily prize game
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Step back in time to a gentler, refined period of history.  I enjoyed this show so much more than say, The Tudors, where there was too much violence and mean intrigue for me.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I really love watching my little pony and I was glad they made this game it's really fun game to play you get to create your own pony Ville so it's a really fun a d cute game but the thing I hate about this game is that the amount of bits and hearts and gems the pound cost it's ridiculous I'm trying to save my gems to get rarity I only have 18 gems good thing they changed the value of gems it cost to get rarity it used to be 60 gems now it cost 30 gems to get rarity but it's really hard to get hearts my mom said I can't buddy people because I'am only 10  so good think I already have a buddy that's fake I think and scoot a loo  used to cost 30 hearts now she cost 60 hearts that's<br /> crazy. Who can get that many hearts? The points don't cost that much. With bits  the most ridiculous thing is the gems the only way to get gems is to level up of tap on the box it some times works. So please change the price of the prices of the buildings and horses so every ones can enjoy the game other ten that it's a great game
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy the design, clothes, cars, whatever. It is so well done. DC also is a delight. But they have to bring young Crawley back. Or not have him dead at all.
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|This game is not that great of a game all you do is take care of the same patient over and over again and even if you bought the full version it still won't be that fun so I'm giving it 3 stars
B008602KQI|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 20 times. At first I did not like it because it does not follow the book, but I decided to give it a second chance without comparing to the book and loved it.<br /><br />As for quality, I have slow internet at my house so whether watching from my computer or kindle there were delays. Had it not been for my internet, the quality would have been outstanding watching through amazon prime.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's a great game but what's the point of the game? I mean all you do is is run and get coins it should have like levels and should be more challenging
B001FB5634|5.0|Purchased this movie for my 80 year old mother and she loved it.  She watches her movies over and over so it will be a lasting enjoyment.

B005M2A4DE|5.0|I bought this for my Grandsons birthday. He loved it.This is his favorite series. I felt the price was reasonable.
B000001DQI|5.0|There were more hits off this album than any other. Plus you get Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding. Musically, that's one of his best.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I always liked the Bourne character, and these movies are awesome. The quality of the first movie is clearly inferior to the last two but I think is just because the technology was superior when they make Supremacy and Ultimatum.
B00006RAKP|4.0|I like most of the 70's hits, some of the 80's and 90's stuff from Reggie.  Needs about three songs that aren't here.  Bought them on Amazon MP3.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I liked the three movies when first saw it at the movie theater so definitely I want it to have them, I think they are the best movies of a superhero so far.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|The book told a great story but sometimes it got a little hard to comprehend.  But over all I would recommend people to read this book because it is a great classic.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Well done Arnold! It's good to see you back in action. Though was a bit amused that the vette didn't have to fill up gas all along the way. Maybe it runs on miracle gas?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like it read to you! It is fun to read for yourself, and use the reader! It is a great Bible. Thanks you for a very good Bible!
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|No character development. Story is &#34;thin&#34; and all over the place. Should have read the reviews before I ordered it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is a nice game I am playing it is fun I enjoy playing it so I am writing you a letter to thank ing you.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|We really enjoyed season 1 but season 2 (Asylum) continues to surprise and delight while scaring the wiz out of us. We can't wait for season 3.
0446310786|5.0|I ordered one, because my high school son had to read it over the summer. It was shipped quickly and he was able to finish it up in time. AND he said it wasn't that bad, actually pretty \\"ok\\".
B009FZFONO|5.0|Best show on TV, hands down.  Order this if you want to see a lot of badass people killing a lot of creepy zombies.
1400049628|3.0|I am a huge zombie fan, but this book reads way too much like an encyclopedia to keep my interest.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The story is  several lifetime,Ed could,pressed into few pages and weaves its tale through the insane world of North Korea. Even if the story were not great you cannot stop reading to learn more about  North Korea, essentially a giant Jonestown. It is chilling in a way that make cormac McCarthy books seem like children's stories. You cannot believe what you are reading but you know that it is true. Could not put it down.
0307346617|5.0|I really enjoyed the intertwining story lines. This is a definite must read for zombie fans. This is a must read!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app.  It gives you great Ideas on different things to do and try for new ideas.  Love it.
B00DTMCSO2|1.0|After installing this game, no game apps will play on my Kindle. Even uninstalling it has left me with freeze ups and crashes where none existed before.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved this series.  The final book did not disappoint.  I have a kindle and the kindle app on my phone so every spare minute I had I was reading.  E L James did a wonderful job.  Story wrapped up nicely.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I've got to say that at first look this seemed like it was going to be too silly to be believed. LOL However, a couple of recommendations convinced me to give it a try, and this is one cool little game.<br /><br />The graphics are outstanding. It really shows off what 3D looking graphics can be on one of these hi-res tabliets (Kindle HD 8.9). The animations are bright, sharp, and very funny.<br /><br />To play, you essentially hit a punch button or a block button, but to win you're going to be tapping the punch button as fast as your fingers can go up and down to tap the screen. HINT: Use two fingers. I alternated tapping with my index and middle finger and racked up the combos! :-D If the other monkey gets on the offensive, just tap and hold the block button until it looks like you have a chance to get a punch back in, then punch like crazy FTW.<br /><br />The game is a \\"campaign\\" endeavor, so as time goes by you can train your monkey to have increased strength, speed, and stamina. During fights you may have bonus buttons show up on the screen. Tap them quick for fancy finishes or things like extra endurance.<br /><br />As you unlock new levels, you earn more customization options for your monkey's leet look.<br /><br />A few bouts do have the capacity to physically tire you out, because the action is frantic and you'll feel it all the way up your arms.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|This publication helped me update my understanding of use of  Kindle products.  It will expand my ability to read in unexpected places.
B001UG56ES|4.0|movie shows life in Darwin  in 1939 and the outback cattle stations. nice settings etc.  well worth watching..beautiful scenery...plenty of action, showing the bombing by Japan and boats burning etc.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The casting for these episodes was great...the real life inside and moneyed family...the behind the scenes action is will worth<br />the price of the three season set...get it...
B006PHD0RW|5.0|When I download this game I immediately fell in love. It is so cute and really fun. The puzzles are really clever and are really well designed. I would recommend buying this game to anyone.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This is definitely a film that should be watched twice as the first viewing may leave you a little confused.  Though once you get everything that's happening and see the big picture, it'll hit you.  The acting is superb, the settings are fantastic and the imagery is astonishing.  Truly a spectacle.  However this movie is much like 2001: A Space Odyssey or The Man From Earth in that depending on your attention span/IQ, you'll either love it or loathe it.  At any rate, give it a chance.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Every time I see this movie I love it more and more.  It has appeal for people of all ages--there's depth I see now as an adult that I guess I never noticed as a kid.  Humor and sentiment are perfectly balanced.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game is so fun i play it every day. the graphics are great and you can put your own pictures on the background and card back side!! great game
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I think this game  is wonderful for every age 1 to 100. It Is EPIC!!!!!! Totally super amazingly crazy super wonderful spectacularly  awesome.<br /><br />  From<br />  Turtle
B00280LYHS|5.0|Good job on the book I really enjoyed it and now I am going to type random words to get to twenty so I can submit this review
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I liked this book so much because it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Once you read the first chapter its almost like you get addicted to the book and there's absolutely no way you can put it down. If you're the kind of person that loves suspense and action, this is the perfect book for you.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I've seen a lot of reviews that lower their rating for the book because they don't like the ending.  If I'd written it, I can't imagine how I would have ended it - but the rest of the story was so compelling, it was well worthwhile.  First &#34;can't put it down&#34; book I've read in a while.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that Mojang should update minecraft pocket edition!!!! I think there should be red stone and red stone things and new mobs also skins!!! Thanks!!!!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A remarkable story - and it is not history - its happening right now. Barely able to put it down.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!! this is an awesome movie and it comes with a digital copy=D  four more words required;-)
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|As in all Tarantino flicks, lots of gushing blood scenes while providing a captivating story line.  Superb acting by the big names and not-so-big names makes this a solid 4 star in my book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|like oh my God I love this game, it makes me soooooooooooo happy that I want to eat ice cream
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I very much enjoyed season 1 of Dr. Who.  It is an enjoyable and thought-provoking series.  I appreciate it being available via Amazon Prime.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Sounded like just what I needed. Too bad it doesn't do ... download to watch later ... like it's supposed to.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of my favorite series of all time! I'm not so much of a touchy-feely guy, but It has incredible dialogue and truly believable characters, that always evoke emotion from me. Highly Recommend!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|loved this read, read the whole series.  I buy Kindle books from Amazon and get music also.  Thanks Amazon for your service
B001I9B9I4|5.0|Great film and very family friendly.  I would gladly recommend this film for a family evening together.  Bring out the popcorn and put your feet up and get ready for a fun evening.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|Kind of strange to root for the Zombies in this one, but &#34;R&#34; grabs you from the beginning.<br />Love takes over and a very strong script develops. &#34;Love is more powerful than death&#34;
B008XG1X18|3.0|I'll be searching threw pins, and it will freeze and go back to the home page or close out completely. Other times I'll being repining and it will freeze and go home. Other than the annoying bugs, this app is great.
1400079144|5.0|Dan Brown's stories are face-paced and exciting. The story happens within a short period of time and the reader is drawn in as a participant as the characters race through events. I didn't want to put the book down until I was finished with it. Very good read.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|I deleted this app right away because it was worthless!No equalizer,just volume control which I already have on my Kindle Fire!Worthless
B00DYCBH4O|4.0|This is a wonderful jem of a free download.  I loved looking at the old illustrations and only wished there had been more than just the 36 of them to see. (Greedy, I know!)
B009NY43NY|5.0|Fantastic novel!! I will miss the Sookie books,but this gives me an excuse to start all over! Definitely deserves a 5 star rating!
0399255370|5.0|My 3 year old might not be able to catch all the humor, but mommy and daddy thought it was hilarious!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|fun for a while but then just gets really old and its like the same thing over and over and over again
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app. it keeps you're brain moving. its great. and its easy to do. after a long day I play solitare.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I'm a big fan of the real tile game, and play weekly.  I'm also a fan of this version.  This is one of the best so far .<br />I also like all the different layouts.
141690977X|4.0|This was good.  I enjoyed reading it and hated when I recognized myself!!  Oh well. :-P  But, yeah, easy, no-brainer read.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I binged on all 42 episodes over a couple of weeks.<br />The series is interesting and a bit uplighting without being sappy.<br />It is a bit of a countrified upstairs/downstairs, in terms<br />of the contrast between British classes.
B00181MHQU|5.0|A breakthrough movie of its time where dance drives the storyline and dance and singing develops organically from dialog and action. A classic movie that is worth watching again and again.
B004BVNUA6|5.0|This record truly shows the full range of Rory's musicianship. From the gentle love song to the hardest rocking blues, it's all there.
B00EKITOXC|5.0|This is excellent.  After 2 episodes, I'm hooked.  If the entire season was available I would simply just binge it in a day or two.
B0057VY45O|5.0|Just found this and have watched 12 shows this week.  Maybe my favorite series ever.  Perfect combination of snarky humor, good acting, sexual tension and snarky humor.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is SUCH a good app! and its so smart! it guesses it almost every time! Love it lots! have gotten alot of fun out of it so far! REALLY GOOD!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|For a few days before watching this movie, I was sorta turned off by the description of the movie. It wasn't that it sounded bad but just didn't sound that exciting in a way. Upon watching this movie last night I can say the description was a understatement of how good this move actually is. The movie is perfectly done in my opinion with a perfectly executed twist.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|One of the best bios I have read in a long time.  Very High on my  \\"recommend you read\\"  list.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This is one of the better Clancy stories in that it has multiple plots woven into a concise interesting book that keeps you wanting to know what happens.  It has enough possible plots to be believable.
B002BPRZU0|5.0|The title song and &#34;Woke Up Dreaming&#34; are standouts but the rendition of every song on the album is great.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|The story is engaging and makes me want to see what happens next. The actors are all very believable in their roles. Entirely enjoyable show.
B005IQZB14|1.0|I wish I would have read the reviews in detail before purchasing this.  Look elsewhere if you are looking for a hiking or adventure book.  If you are interested in excruciating, unending cycles of bad decisions and whining, this is your book.  Hard to believe this is non-fiction, as others have mentioned.
B008KOMMTA|5.0|If u love James camron and titanic then this is the perfect collection for u. It have very cool stuff
B0000844I8|4.0|The only disappointment is that this movie is not closed captioned in English. Other than that, the quality of the DVD couldn't be better.
B0090XO57C|5.0|The BBC is the greatest thing ever. The planet earth is so cool. I would highly recommend it it everybody
B002PYW26Y|4.0|I know a lot of people have panned this film, but I like it. It's campy and fun. I like the option of owning the DVD and having it in my video library so I can watch it anywhere on my laptop.
B00005RYKU|5.0|This movie is a great thriller. I love Diane lane and does a great job in this movie. I would recommend it
B00821OX98|5.0|Its been a very good series , but as with another recent SI-FI release no original invasion to start the series. Just the survival fights.
B0017TWUZG|5.0|Love this website. I was looking everywhere for this movie. And amazon had it. Thanks for having it. Setup 2 is a great movie
B004N6369Y|5.0|Another great book by an extremely talented writer. Each time a new book comes out... I get it right away.
B009NUV0E8|5.0|This film is one of the best 007 movies of all time. The videogame for the Nintendo 64 is so great.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I LOVE THIS GAME BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY ADDS SO BUT ANYWAY STILL GRATE GAME I LOVE IT A LOT!!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It is typical of Hosseini's outstanding writing skills.  I didn't enjoy it as much at The Kite Runner as it was a little over the top in descriptions and seemed disconnected at a couple of places.  Never the less, I highly recommend it!
B009HUB40Y|3.0|I like this game it is a very fast paced game similar to bejewel blitz. I liked how you know exactly when the time will run out. I would recommend this game to other.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I didn't expect the intensity of this piece and I was impressed. Flynn did an excellent job describing the mind of a sociopath and the destruction she orchestrates on the lives of those around her.  Excellent job.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I was looking for something to write notes to myself and recipes in and this was perfect because I have put so many recipes in it already. I also like the fact that it is color coder makes it easy to find what you are looking for.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I like this game. it keeps me occupied when I'm bored. My kids like to play it too. They really like the Dragon.
0985557834|5.0|J.D. has managed to get me into paracord knotting and this books are nothing short of amazing. They offer great step by step instructions and for the most part, are easy to master after a couple tries. If there is anything I can complain about its that 90% of these ties have already been shown to use via his Facebook page. While that is not a bad thing, its a little but of a bummer for those who have followed his work every week hoping to get a bunch of new ties out of his latest book. None the less, I would consider this book a MUST HAVE for any para cord knotter from beginner to expert. The pouch instructions alone are worth the money. Although he states 550 cord is fine, I would strongly suggest getting 450 cord to do these ties. They fit, fold and tie better to get the desired affect. Pick this book up now and you will never want to  put it down.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|When I was playing this game I loved it but I ran out of money to make food. So I sold some furniture but then this game froze. This happened with another team lava game I don't like this game and the company.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I love that not only does he have good flow and beats, but that he has lyrical content.  He can go from being funny, to talking about serious social issues or deep personal trails from one track from the next.
B00E8B1358|4.0|Lots of twist and turns, very entertaining, I loved it! Very well done. I look forward to future episodes, go Joe
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|My boys love this game! Definitely want to play with kids who are at least 1st/2nd grade so they are able to build without frustration and play on their own.
B003WGM40S|4.0|There is so much in this- this... it can only be accurately described as a masterpiece! Every part, relate-able in some degree; there seems to be deeper meanings to quite a number of the scenes throughout the entire production.  A tragedy, a romance, some comedy, action and adventure! The story of Tess D'Urbervilles has it all. I both hated and loved this film.<br /><br />I'm upset. I never thought, picking this up, would it provoke such strong emotions in me. Its two in the morning and i'm due to wake in only a few short hours after going to bed right before I played the first episode. I couldn't stop watching. Damn the creator. Damn and bless him/ her in the same breath.  It ended and I would've still watched more given the chance. Damn the entire cast!!<br /><br />I couldn't make up my mind on the rating, so i gave it a four because i couldn't bare to give it any less.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. it really does have that classic mario feel.it is amazing. i think i like this one better tho just because i like throwing the acorns :)
B005PK57IK|5.0|I so enjoy watching (and rewatching) &#34;The Good Wife&#34;; the casting and acting are superb and the timeliness of the topics never fail to interest me.
B00CWVBV4E|4.0|The movie quality is great on kids IPad, the ease of downloading was great! Very impressed with Prime, don't know why I didn't check it out before.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game 6 years and up. A little complicated for kids under six. Gem system a little confusing for younger players too.
030745455X|4.0|The book was fine no problems with it read the others as well and found them all to be good
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Whenever I try to review a Neil Gaiman book, I'm always looking for the perfect words to do it justice but it so very hard to sum up genius in just a few paragraphs. His typical books usually land in the magical realism genre and THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE is definitely a part of that genre. In this book, there's a chilling quality to his writing that makes you shiver throughout, and it leaves you wondering how close to the truth his magical world really is. Everything is based on real life lessons so it's hard to believe there isn't a bit of truth in his every word.<br /><br />Despite its paranormal/magical realism genre, the book is really a story about growing up and the blurred lines between childhood and adulthood. Some situations can make children grow older faster, despite their ability to overcome troublesome ordeals.  However, as children we have a tendency to believe anything, even if things are a little bit farfetched, so some of these farfetched and imaginative situations can impact us a great deal. This novel is narrated by a nameless seven year old main character so you really have to question the accuracy of some situations. Are things really happening the way they are narrated or are the facts confused by some little boy's overactive imagination? That's the charm of Gaiman's writing because it makes you question everything, despite your strong grip on reality.<br /><br />The nameless narrator is a very shy boy who befriends a strange country girl named Lottie Hempstock. After meeting her, things get a little strange. Things get even stranger when he pulls a worm out from a hole under his foot. Disguised as the new housekeeper for his family, the monster (or the flea as Lottie calls it) that haunts the small English town makes his life miserable. He's the only one in his family that truly sees the evil hiding behind the housekeeper facade and he faces danger when he tries to defy the monster's orders. He finds help in Lottie and her mother and grandmother, who try to help him as much as possible with their strange and eccentric abilities. As the third generation, Lottie is only 11 years old but she seems wise beyond her years. Together, the old lady, the middle age woman and the eager pre-adolescent make a strange female trio. The whole setting and story is eerie, curious and fantastic, but I was on the edge of my seat until the very end.<br /><br />For a short book, it had a lot of things to say. From the few Gaiman books I've read, after reading THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE, I have to issues saying that he is a master at what he does. He has the ability to write wonderful YA and children's books (for example Coraline) but I think his talent is best suited for Adult books. Despite it being told from the point of view of a seven year old, I would definitely qualify this book as an Adult book because of some of the themes. Because I like strange books, I really enjoyed this one because it made me believe everything that was happening and pushed the limits of my imagination.randmother, who try to help him as much as possible with their strange and eccentric abilities.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would rate this at the top because it was a book that one could not put down.  I would get to the end of a chapter, and had to start the next chapter and continue.  Very good in content.  If you enjoy science fiction you will enjoy this book.  It is in three parts and you will want to read all three.  There were parts in it, that did not seem possible, but still kept you reading to the end.  You will learn to love your country for the fereedom we have!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I saw this on TV but wanted the set for my collection. Any Eagles fan will love this gives you the background on the group.
B0030B1WBM|5.0|Love this movie, a great remake of an awesome classic.<br />I would recommend to anyone to buy this movie the kids will love it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is by far the best and most informative book I've read in quite some time. It is abundantly clear that the author is a scholar and is indeed knowledgeable about what he writes here, that is, Jesus the man and his first century Palestine surroundings. The book does not read like so many others that are dry, lifeless academics. The author manages to meld an incredibly gripping style of writing with solid information.<br /><br />Regardless of what one thinks of Jesus, as this book also makes clear, there is simply too much evidence (as much evidence as can be had regarding a man from 2000 years ago) that Jesus did in fact do &#34;wonders&#34;/&#34;deeds&#34; and that he was in fact crucified. As someone studying Islam, I have often wondered how anyone could deny the fact that Jesus was crucified. Sources that are favourable, neutral or even hostile towards the man Jesus all agree on that one point, that he was crucified. As for any resurrection, as the author states, that is beyond the scope of the historian and is therefore a matter of faith. I agree.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is even slightly interested in the historical Jesus and the political climate he lived in. I also found the information regarding the friction between Paul, who in my mind created the Christianity that we know today, and James, the brother of Jesus and the leader of the church in Jerusalem. I wish I could get my Christian friends to read this book, as I believe it would help us to understand one another better.

1416596585|5.0|The insight into how Google acheived its dominance by doing things differently is fascinating. Their devotion to intellectual excellence and to paradigms that allowed them to scale their infrastructure while containing cost is a lesson worth learning. They manage to achieve vertical integration without losing site to their core business - their algorithms or their core asset - information. The book makes clear the mutually advantageous relationship Google has established with their millions of users. It remains to be seen if Google can continue to honour this social contract and continue to not be evil. I look forward to the author writing an update in a few years time.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Product fullfills the descripcion that it states. I have a s4 galaxy and an iphone 4s, i connect both devices and they charge at an incredible speed. Delivery was punctual. I highly recommend it. Very satisfied customer.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie was FANTASTIC!!<br /><br />The blu-ray was okay.  Maybe I'm spoiled by Peter Jackson, but I found the featurettes/additions to be a little lacking.  The only reason why I didn't take off an entire star is because the digital copy works with iTunes so at least I can watch it wherever I am.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|So far I have an ok experience with chromecast. Issues,<br /><br />From the package device was not working. I had to follow the troubleshooting steps.<br />If I make it full screen it becomes full screen on tv, but then I can't use the laptop, else I have to minimize.<br />Video streams on both laptop and chromecast. If chromecast is gonna do it directly from the URL then stop streaming on the browser. Now I have to hide my laptop monitor somewhere.<br />Audio on chormecast seems to have a bit of lag compared to laptop.<br />Streaming is just normal not great even with the booster that comes with the package.<br />I used it once kept it attached to the tv. When played after 2 days I had to redo all the troubleshooting steps once again to get it working. This is a show stopper for me.<br />I am not sure these are all issues with the device I have, but so far I am not very happy with the product.

B005PXXDP6|3.0|I bought this single CD 20th Anniversary reissue of Nevermind on the good advice from another Amazon reviewer. One CD of Nevermind is more than enough, I'm sure the 2 or 3 CD reissues are overkill. The original album has some good songs, but the live bonus tracks tend to run together, as one is the same as the next and the next etc.
B004SDEP38|4.0|The software meets my immediate needs. It affords the adequate manipulation of documents on the run. I chose the software because it was introduced on the tablet i purchased. I have no negative comments at this time as i have not fully explored the capabilities.
B009GJC3AG|5.0|I owned this album on LP many years ago, it sounded like it was recorded over the phone. This new re-mastered version sounds great! I can always tell if the sound has been re-mastered by whether a CD gives my sub woofer a workout or not. This CD put my sub woofer to work and then some!

B0001N9ZKW|5.0|I own almost everything Richard Thompson, with or without Linda, has released. Of the Richard & Linda Thompson albums, this is second only to Shoot Out the Lights. Contains one classic song after another, from When I Get to the Border to The Great Valerio. Live bonus tracks are a plus, including a ten minute version of their standard The Calvary Cross.
B008Y2X78S|4.0|We have enjoyed this series very and are hoping for continuation next season. Our only complaint is that we purchased it via download and much of the video is grainy and odd looking at times, while other scenes are crystal clear (like you would expect having spent extra for HD version).
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|my 6 year old granddaughter loves this game. she's really into girlie games, and this really fits the bill perfectly.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is great writing, casting and acting. They got this one right for sure. Anyone who likes Conan Doyle's SH stories should really enjoy this up to date adaptation of his timeless works. This has plenty of action and a sense of realism. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes police or action movies.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|This was something the whole family enjoyed together. The characters are all so interesting.  The costumes are fantastic.  I'm really looking forward to the next season.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|had difficulty hearing the audio and yes it was turned all the way up.<br />The streaming was weak and kept stopping and restarting.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is one of our families all time favorite movies.  One of the best Musicals of all time.  I love pretty much anything that stars Julie Andrews.  If you haven't seen this movie...you should!
B0052AC8C6|2.0|This may be appropriate for the 3-4 yr old group.<br />It was very boring for an adult and 10 year old.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books and the movies being created for them! The Best of Me was suspenseful and kept me reading until I read it three days! An honest test jerker and a startling ending! A must read for anyone!
B002M87W9K|5.0|&#34;YOU GOT TO KNOW THE TERRITORY&#34;  This is a fun musical for all the family to watch.  My kids (ages 6 to 16) all enjoyed it.  Great way to spend an afternoon together.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've heard about this book just about everywhere and lets just say I read it in 3 days! Wow! What a rush and it lives up to every woman's fantasy of wanting a \\"Christian Grey\\". A must read if you like suspense and romance novels! It is intense and kick your hormones into overdrive but I am on the second one now! Enjoy ladies ;)
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I little blotchy when navigating within the app and hard to get home after you're in the app. But it does what it's supposed to do.

B009XWD02G|1.0|It messes up very often. It freezes when I try to download a song. I cannot find all the songs that I want to listen to.
0143038419|5.0|This book spoke to me as a &#34;wannabe&#34; traveler, a lover of culture and relationships, and as a newbie meditate-er.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I will always love this family classic. It's especially fun to play with the new rules in the tournament mode.

B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I love the customization for the suits along with the variety of suits. I really like the action in this game.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|This book dragged on, a bit. The progression of the story line seemed to take longer than per usual, but it was interesting. Not a concept you see every day. This being said, I absolutely ADORED the sequel to this book, &#34;Where She Went.&#34;<br /><br />I recommend both.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|So much fun to play with what a cute cat, and adorable tricks.would recomend for any age.have it on while listening to music.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|not very kindle-compatible. I would rather just use my phone just for the sheer convenience of it. Would not recommend.
0143038419|4.0|Did you ever feel you really needed time to find yourself? Many do, and they focus their efforts in different ways. Some try to cut back on work and find better life balance. Others take up a hobby. Still more decide that volunteer work and giving back is the way to go. And there is a very small minority who travel abroad and spend several months living in other countries. This latter means to self-discovery is the back drop for Eat, Pray, Love, a book about a woman in search of herself and a better understanding of life.<br /><br />This book is written like a travel memoir and the author does her best to describe in vivid detail the places she visits and the people she meets. She talks about the different cultures in Italy, India, and Indonesia. She talks about the colorful and interesting people she meets. She talks about the different cultures and their enriching traditions. The book's descriptions are often vivid, memorable, and interesting and some of the people and places will remain in your memory long after turning the book's final page.<br /><br />Eat, Pray, Love is all about a woman in search of herself and as I finished each of the three sections, I did, indeed, get the feeling that the author was finally coming around and learning more about who she is, but one thing is abundantly clear: She had major personal issues to overcome. The greatest hurdle for her to clear was with her failed personal relationships. She still had not come to terms with her divorce and the splitting up with a recent boyfriend. She references these two events over and over again and this repetitiveness, however honest it may be, will grate on some readers' nerves. I kept waiting for the subject to drop, once and for all, but it continues to come back. I suppose it is difficult for some people to let go, but you really start to wonder if these chapters of the author's past will ever close for good.<br /><br />This book covers three different countries/experiences and those who read it and like what they read will have a different section they like most. I felt the India experience was the best, at least for the author, because it was here that she seemed to make great progress and seemed to finally get over the hump of personal guilt and shame that had left her inept and filled her with self-doubt for so long. It is also here, in India, that the author seems to get in touch with her spiritual side. The meditation and praying may not work for everyone but it seemed to work for her. I also like the last part of the book, in Bali Indonesia, because it is here that the author finds love and romance- again, things obviously very important to her and for which she was ultimately seeking, even if she didn't quite realize it at the start of the book.<br /><br />Eat, Pray, Love is meant to be a serious book, and for the most part, it is serious. But it is also loaded with good humor with the author offering her witty, colorful descriptions of most everything she encounters. Her humor is often quite self- deprecating and some would say she pushes the boundaries of creative non- fiction a little too far, but most will agree that her style is fun and that it helped keep the more serious situations lightened up and the pages turning.<br /><br />Finding yourself can take time. For some, it is a never ending search that doesn't completely materialize in spite of one's best efforts. For the book's author, it took an extended stay in three different countries to figure out who she truly is and gain a better understanding of what really matters. Yes, the book is self- centered for the most part, but it was intended that way. Readers should not approach this book expecting a woman-saves-the-world type of story complete with endless giving and sacrifice. This is a book about finding yourself, and for one woman, it appears the journey is over and the task is complete.d it and like what they read will have a different section they like most.

B004H4XDBI|5.0|This book is the sequel to &#34;If I Stay.&#34; That being said, I absolutely ADORED this book. The story line was well formed and the characters were extremely cathartic; you actually felt what they felt. I love it, it's a great and simple read.<br /><br />I highly recommend.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Once again the world is saved from destruction, this time by multiple comic book heroes.  You get what you expect - lots of CGI, impossible feats, some clever dialog.  Somehow logic is not a strong suite in these movies (duh- it's inspired from a comic book) - the heroes get thrown all around, but get up and shake it off... how enviable. And there are holes in the plot.... (duh- it's inspired from a comic book)<br /><br />BUT, for what it is - it's great escapism.  It's a guy movie.<br /><br />It made a ton of money, so there will be sequel's!!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Downloaded this after hearing RAVEEE reviews about it. Maybe because I watched the movie first, but I just could not seem to get into this book. It dragged on and was uninteresting. I honestly wouldn't recommend this book.
B005HP2J66|4.0|It's a shame that this movie is not longer, and includes only limited commentary about the remarkable history of exquisite art from the time of the Cro Magnon -- once thought to be an &#34;inferior&#34; species of human. In fact, they created such magnificent art with limited tools in the depths of pitch-black caves that are equal to the finest paintings on earth in any age. Herzog has a fascination with the exotic, bizarre, unexpected and remarkable, and this movie is no exception. It lacks drama -- and mostly just tells a tale of their exploration of a well-studied location that is off-limits to most of us. But for what it is, it's well done and well worth watching. You will dream of lions!
0446554995|5.0|A great continuation of the series--the characters are terrific--hope the authors keep giving us more of Agent Pendergast, D'Agosta and Corrie. I can (and often do) go back and re-read all the books.
B007V65R54|5.0|Definitely, a must-read for everyone whose job involves predictions/forecasts. I work in Strategic Planning at a consumer goods comapany and it has been really helpful to improve the accuracy of my forecasts.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I am not a &#34;young adult&#34; but I often enjoy books written for young adults because I don't like violence and gore- to me that is not entertainment- I can watch the news or one of the abundance of cop TV shows. This book was well-written and speaks to all of us- regardless of age.
1423124111|5.0|A beautiful coffee-table book featuring lots of amazing artwork from the Disney parks that should be in the library of any Disney theme park fan.<br /><br />This book compiles hundreds of attraction posters from the Walt Disney Imagineering archives, and presents them in a gorgeous large-size format. Aside from being great pieces of art on their own (which they are), attraction posters also serve a couple of other roles in the Disney parks.<br /><br />The posters in this book are great examples of the Imagineering practice of simplifying complex subjects so that they can be \\"read\\" quickly by Guests (what I call \\"Read-ability\\"). This is the same technique employed in many Disney attractions where the Guests have only a few moments to \\"read\\" a scene and understand the scene's part in the overall story of the attraction. Examples of this technique are common in the classic Disney dark rides, including Pirates of the Caribbean (my favorite example being the jail scene, where the pirates try to get the key to their cell from a nearby dog) and Haunted Mansion.<br /><br />Guests typically glance at attraction posters quickly as they move through the parks, often not paying them all that much attention. The magic of these posters is that they communicate the essence of their subjects quickly and effectively, so that Guests can understand what awaits them if they choose to experience the attractions elsewhere in the park.<br /><br />Attraction posters also serve as a form of \\"weenie\\" (the term Walt Disney used to describe something that says to people 'come this way'), enticing Guests to check out the various attractions throughout the parks.<br /><br />As a fan and student of Imagineering, reading this book helped me appreciate how the Imagineers use these posters to lead and guide their audience into and through the Disney parks.<br /><br />As you might guess from this review, I strongly recommend this book to any Disney park fan, as well as to graphic designers and illustrators.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Recovery of a damaged girl is beautifully written and so original. I could not put the book down. The language of flowers is a real thing- from Victorian times- and is beautifully woven into the story.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is fun but need to make more items available for bananas because every thing is only bought by coins
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I have been a fan of Josh Grobans for about 15+ years now.  I own all his cd's and I've seen him in concert 8 times.  I love all of his cd's but on each one, there is ususally one or two songs I skip over.  Not because I don't adore Josh, its more of a musical taste (ie. Im not a fan of French music, etc.).  But ALL THAT ECHOES is by far my favorite of all his cd's.  There isn't one song that I skip over...I love them ALL.  I HIGHLY recommend this cd!!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is a book that will suck you in and spit you out a different person. It will make you reconsider your use of each day and whether you live to fill your days or allow your days to fill you.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|It helped me understand children of Asperger and it helped him understand himself. It sparked a long meaningful conversation between us that I doubt would have ever happened otherwise.
B0086900TI|4.0|Teaching isn't an easy gig under any circumstances. But, when you're Henry Barthes, in a crap-hole like this, it's darn near impossible.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Henry Barthes is a substitute teacher who's had a troubled childhood. He likes subbing so he doesn't stay attached to anyone or any place. He's on assignment in a tough, inner city school. He wants to make a difference but fears he cannot. He helps a young prostitute and does what he can with both his students and fellow teachers, while looking after an aging, sick grandfather living in assisted care.<br /><br />This is a very powerful movie with a lot more grit than \\"Up the Down Staircase\\" or \\"To Sir with Love.\\" These kids are tough, mean spirited and not afraid to get in the teachers' faces with cursing and threats. Barthes (Adrien Brody) seems to work well here. He knows that standardized teaching is out the door. He needs to reach them so he uses unconventional methods to do so. They don't spend a lot of time in his class, but they spend enough to show his methods work. He has a knack for reading a situation and playing it correctly. He takes in, against his better judgement, a young (teenage?) prostitute who responds to his kindness, but this puts him in deeper than he would like. He prefers being detached.<br /><br />This is a heck of a movie. Brody has had a few mis-steps in his career but he does an outstanding job here. He found the voice in his character and stays on beat the whole time. There is a strong cast of back-ups as well. Marcia Gay Harden, James Caan, Lucy Liu, Christina Hendricks among others fill in the gaps very well. Sami Gayle as Erica, the prostitue, does a really good job for someone early in their career. The music is good, the writing, editing, cinematography etc. are as good as they need to be to make this happen.<br /><br />This does get heavy handed at the end and leaves some questions unanswered, but overall this is about as good a film as you're likely to see on the subject.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is exactly what I needed, works perfectly for all my calculation needs, is nicely designed, and my preschooler even enjoys playing with it!
B00CZAYNOC|2.0|Before I get into this, please know that I am a fan of this band, and have been since The Way of The Fist and Even Ivans' days in the awesome MOTOGRATER.... That being said, this hotly anticipated album fell far short of my expectations. The passion of the lyrics are gone and replaced with curse-laden drivel and nonsense. I like hearing cussing in my Metal but when it is done right, this is ALMOST dabbling into LIMP BIZKIT territory when it comes to Ivans' use of the F Bomb.....It is ridiculous, and kills the whole vibe of the album for me. The other 3 albums all had songs that lifted me up through dark times and after 4 listens of this cd, I feel nothing but disappointment and possibly a lower IQ. I get why people like it so much, I really do. American ears have been desensitized to ridiculous money hungry attempts where the band just gives up and rakes in all the cash while you bang your head and think you're cool for listening to a \\"heavy\\" band. This band had the chance to reach Slipknot style Mainstream success but after this, I truly don't think they have the songs or the desire to do so. Slipknot stayed heavy while going mainstream, this garbage is just noise that sounds like it was written by a pissed off 15 yr old in his mommy's basement. The music here is solid but nothing stands out for me. This band is too talented to release such a slap in the face but that's the way the business goes. At least we got 3 awesome, uplifting, powerful albums from these guys. Sorry if this review makes you angry, but it's just how I feel. I wanted to like it, but I can't. And by the way, the guest appearances are not needed, and truly doesn't add much to the album. Rob Halford kills on here and Maria Brink is ok, but other than those 2 it is just disappointment song after song. I hope they step up their game next time around ESPECIALLY LYRICALLY  or this will be the end for one of the best Modern Metal bands of this generation
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is addictive. Play it as often as possible. Better than the real thing in arcades because of the great bonus games.
B0076UXKDG|4.0|Good build - obviously works well with the Nikon D800. Unlike the battery pack for the D200, one of the batteries resides inside the camera body, the other in this enclosure. When it's time to recharge both batteries, the MB-D12 has to be unscrewed and removed (not the end of the world!). The vertical trigger and AF buttons are great - making the D800 a lot easier to shoot with. Apart from the price being a bit high, it's a great product.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|We loved seeing this movie in the theater and the kids love watching it at home in 3D. The sound is also fantastic in 7.1 or 5.1 surround.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I realize the book is directed at a YA audience and reading level, but the thin plot doesn't benefit from the overwrought attempts at descriptive depiction, such as, literally, \\"bent as easily as a blade of grass bending sideways\\" and \\"electric blue dyed hair that stuck up around the sides of his head like the tentacles of a startled octopus.\\" Many of them come off like that fabled List of the 10 Worst Similes Ever Constructed by High School Students, such as describing what passes for dancing as \\"a lot of swaying back and forth with occasional lunges toward the floor as if one of them had dropped a contact lens.\\" These kinds of description might be expected from the target demographic of this over-hyped volume, but only serve to distract from the story with odd, disjointed or repetitive imagery when they deign to rear their heads.<br />The plot is both thin and, as many other reviewers have pointed out, very derivative. At the risk (albeit low) of spoiling a plot point, the lead villain turning out to be the lead protagonist's father is merely the tip of the iceberg. And while George Lucas might not have been the first to utilize that specific scenario, either, he at least presented it well.<br />Eragon, too, was very derivative, yet well-written, especially considering its author was less than half the age of Ms. Clare when he began writing it, so a derivative plot need not be the death knell of a novel should it be properly executed. Woefully, that's not the case with this disappointing piece of Young Adult literary schlock. There's the requisite love triangle (though with a few tacked-on tertiary complications, none of which particularly enhance the story but at least lend a slight bit of depth to the otherwise contrived situation), the awkward later realization of budding incestuous romance, the shallow plot of the villain to destroy what he regards as \\"the lower species,\\" all the staples of a derivative run-of-the-mill fantasy romp but without the execution ordepth to set it apart from the crowd.<br />It's not the worst story ever, but it's far from even being par for the course. I realize Ms. Clare comes from a background of writing fanfiction. That's very evident in her work; given its overall quality, I'd almost postulate that she's merely succeeded in writing fanfiction ironically set in a world she herself created.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|It is really nice to be able to watch this movie anytime I feel like it without having to purchase it.
B004T9T2AC|1.0|Don't waste your time with this book.  You will not learn anything, however it will motivate you to waste money on investments that you are ill prepared to invest in.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Good app because it has four levels of expertise to play. Only downside is it alerts you to your mistakes right away which serves as a hint.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|my husband loved this movie so that is why i rented it on my roku using amazon. would recommend. thanks
0451209338|4.0|This book was ok but not the best Gabriel Allon book.  A necessary first book to understand Allon but not as good as some of the later ones.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|The movie was great. I rented it for my husband. He loves Matt Damon's movies. We would recommend renting this movie
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I thought that House of Cards would be a nice summertime diversion.  Instead, it turned out to be one of the best series I have watched this year or any other year.  As always, Kevin Spacey was outstanding.  And Robin Wright who I had not seen in other roles was not overshadowed in the least.  Supporting roles were also well cast.  Am very much looking forward to season 2.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|evernote is easy to use &amp; unbelievably helpful. I would definitely recommend this app. I use it all the time and have never had a problem with it.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I read another review where someone says \\"Abrams takes a burned out franchise and renews it\\" I couldn't agree more. I am a DIE HARD trek fan. Been watching since i was 5 years old, which was right about the time the series ended. I have watched every Movie, spin off, and now yet another adaptation of my beloved show, only to see i was ecstatic at the portrayal of things, with some gripes (mostly minor) that exist solely because i try not to be a purist, but as a sci fi fan you just cannot help it sometimes.<br /><br />The action, the re telling of the story, and Cumberbatchs' homage to the timeless Montalban villain, left you really appreciating the herculean task that Abrams took on, and that, given what, when, and where he had to work it, he did a great job. I look forward to more films, but will be hesitant, since hollywoods endless need for money ruins even the mighty phoenix's ability to rise from the ashes.<br /><br />One can debate that Pine or Quinto didnt deliver this, or that, as you can pick apart anything, but as much as i did not want to like Quinto as Spock, i found myself warming to this re imagined version of him as somehow (i know its blasphemy) more human. In the end, if you ever liked anything Star Trek, you MUST see this and decide for yourself, or if you dont know Star Trek (like lived in a cave), this would be a welcome place to drop in after you see the first Abrams movie.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I don't usually like this kind of movie, but was kept interested in all the different characters lives and problems.
B004132HZS|5.0|I got feedback today from my friends, who this gift was given, and they are thrilled with this. (they are a tough couple to buy for!)

Thank goodness Christmas is covered for them now too!!!

B004Q08BE2|3.0|OK, of course some shocking scenes for those who may not be prepared for it.  SPOILER:  I did really like the scene in which she &#34;transforms&#34; into the Black Swan.

B003TOH8AE|3.0|It was OK, some very definite comic moments,  glad I saw it but don't know if I'm too interested in watching again.

B005QYKE2Y|2.0|I truly, truly did want to enjoy this with all of the enthusiasm of a teenager or perhaps, preteen? Somehow, the formula is the same in every blow them up movie made by Mr. Bay. I lost interest in the first 15 minutes after realizing that the deja vu I was experiencing was occurring because indeed..i had seen this before. Too bad, what could have been a great series or better yet a pair of films, wound up being another franchise with absolutely no consideration for the audiences intelligence.

0060899220|5.0|I've been working in the restaurant business for over 13 years and some of the things he talks about really strikes a nerve with me.  I don't know how many times I've yelled out loud, \\"I KNOW, RIGHT!\\" when he mentions working for a micromanaging owner or talks about contempt for picky customers.  A really great read if you work in the business.  Any negative reviews for this book are likely from people with boring desk jobs who have never worked a day in a restaurant.

B00C7DGRL4|4.0|one of my kids saw this and said she loved it. I don't love it but it is comical if you give it a chance.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|it works as stated.  I wanted something that has a little more tools than this provides.  Its great for entertaining the kids with though.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|my youngest loves this movie, i have yet to find a niche in which to like this movie :( wish i could
0156034026|5.0|Really loved this one. Great insight into the mind of a Pakistani in the US -  a refreshing opportunity to look at the world from a completely different perspective.
0345529057|5.0|I love the character development and the story line! its not as gruesome and graphic as I thought it would be. Amazing series.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie and picture quantity is great I enjoy watch this movie on my computer. I also download the APP for my iPad I will enjoy other movie when I travel
B00AEFXZJE|4.0|Can Kevin Bacon make a bad movie?  Not as far as I'm concerned.  Hard to believe the movie is almost 50 years old.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|I have loved this movie for years and so when I seem it on hereI just had to have it
B0000DIXDR|5.0|My all-time favorite movie.  I wore out the VCR and am working on the DVD.  Never tire of watching this!
1595828753|5.0|This novel is great I enjoyed very much and I think this is a must have for any person who is a fan
078322737X|5.0|From my generation so I felt right at home.  It's one of those movies I never tire of watching.  Just wish the world could go back to that time!
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I have loved the  original movies so when I seen this remake I just had to have it and I was not disappointed
B00BKRON5K|5.0|This is a clear and concise text on the whys Nd how's of dieting and eating how we were created to eat.  That author does a great job<br />In describing what went wrong
B001ANYDAO|5.0|If you want to read an excellent book about how brilliant people can be overlooked by society but they become stars in our lives this is a must read
B00A285OOW|5.0|I have read all the books in the Cousin's War.  This by far was the best of the series.  This was not based on the facts but on the story.  It was enjoyable and I found that I could not put my Kindle down.  Definitely a wonderful very good read.
B00CUHMUZ4|5.0|As usual,  Andre's performance are top-rate, entertaining--in a class by themselves, as is he.--loved the DVD. Everyone should s=view one of his DVD's.
B002361MLA|5.0|It has basically all we need to know for spiritual progress.  It's written in understandable language.  I use it as a spiritual reference manual.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I ordered the cd a month ago and haven't been able to stop listening.  The music and lyrics are great and the feel is very current.  Bowie doesn't try to go in a new direction, he travels the same path as before but is much more enhanced. This is &#34;Rock and Roll&#34; at it's finest!!
B000ID1J5E|5.0|The River Wild is an excellent film. It´s Meryl Streep at her best, as usual. Beautiful locations. the film keeps the viewer tuned every single minute without hesitation. I congratulate the people or the film suppliers of Amazon for their prompt delivery as well as the quality of the DVD that is not new or unused.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Great show! Definitely got me hooked on Dr. Who. Wish I had started it sooner. Looking forward to seeing the final episode!
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|I'm not a big gamer so the lack of instructions is sometimes frustrating. Someone who plays a lot of pc/system games will probably find it very easy.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much but the military abbreviations were awful. A glossary of the military abbreviations was desperately needed.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|If you like mahjong this should keep you happy. It has a good selection of layouts, easy to discern tiles, and moves quickly.
B008602KQI|5.0|It had a very exciting story line from start to finish.  I have not seen a film like this one.  Never get tired watching it.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|I love Sudoku and this is easier than bringing the books with you. Sometimes the small numbers are difficult to touch accurately. It has all the features needed to figure out even more difficult puzzles.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|It always kept me on the edge of my seat. The barber and I compare notes on this show and never get tired of watching it.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Flow Free passes the time and keeps you thinking. As it get harder, it can get frustrating. Easy to put away when you have to.
1439152810|2.0|I loved Kate Morton's 1st 3 books and eagerly awaited this one. Boy, was I disappointed. First, let me say I had the audiobook. Kate Morton weaves words together like a picture and the narrator was wonderful. However, both of those pluses didn't help the agony of this book. There is way too much information (much of it unnecessary to the storyline). It is tedious. I was 1/3 way thru and ready to give up on it before I had the least interest in continuing. Because I paid \\"good money\\" I felt I had to continue but I didn't enjoy it. I didn't like the characters. NONE of them were likable or caught me. There was a nice twist at the end but it was also a bit \\"unreal\\" as to how it could have worked like it did. I gave the book 2 stars for the beautifully written word NOT for the story or the way it was woven together. It was also hard to follow as it shifted from era to era, country to country, city to city. It was convoluted at best. I will never buy another Kate Morton book without reading all the reviews I can first.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you should put redstone in I mean there is the or but you can't get it. next update please do it. ;)
B000FBJHT4|5.0|Great reading I hope this Government of are's starts telling the truth..The truth must be told about Roswell this story must be told we are not alone.
B000002J5K|5.0|My 77 yearold father in law was watching the Blues Brothers and had turn up the music scenes. Said he really liked the music. My wife bought him the soundtrack to enjoy!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Not one of his best pictures but not his worst one! The CGI was wonderful but there were too many holes in the plot! For me, that meant that the editing was all about getting Tom Cruise scenes in, but not letting us know the whys and what fores! It was typical Tom Cruise moves with him out performing his stunt man on fight scenes and motorcycle moves. Once again, his female co-star was too young!! (It's one of my gripes seeing the male lead have a too-young female lead, like there weren't any females his own age who could play the part!) I'm tired of there being a 20-30 year difference in ages with the lead actors!!! Plus, Tom is showing his age!<br />After my husband and I watched the movie, we both commented on wishing we had just watched regular tv instead!
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|The movie was better than I expected. Glad I purchased the Blu-ray with digital copy.  Now I'm able to watch the copy on the go
B004FRX0MY|3.0|If you are not a tech, it hard to use the cloud and sinc of  your play list to the Kindle.  Instructions are over the top and hard to get your arms around it.  The younger generation has had IPOD forever and it is a no brainer but me being a baby boomer, it take a little more information and asking questions to several other people to get it all working right!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app doesn't run the same as the Droid smartphone app but it's pretty close. I'm not bored with it yet!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|If finally made my old Kindle work as well as the first Kindle firer, neither one would boot up and I followed all the recommendations and called the help desk, between two different tech's; one wanting to give me $100 off towards a purchase of a 3rd Kindle since the warranty had expired and settled for a reburished and the second tech immediately said get this cable with charge and guarantee it will work.  With a reburished kindle firer and new cable and accelerated charging they both work fine. Yeah and saved me buying a third Kindle!  Definitely worth getting!  Although, Amazon should has made that clear when you have repeated problem with two different models that this is a solution.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the best books of science fiction I ever read! (now for the third time!) OSC is a really good writer I enjoy his books
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|I get a kick out of some superhero flicks, but I couldn't get past the 1st 1/2 hour of this nightmare.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Super big and spacious... didnt think it was going to be that big. It fits my camera and my lens all and much more... it looks and feels of great material, from which i feel comfortable carrying without me worrying .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This meets my needs. I use this when I am on the computer it's easier to use than the one on my computer.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Ok so my kindle was not letting me watch videos on YouTube so I got this app.  The first time it was great.  Now whenever I click on it the screen goes white than black.  Then it just stays black.  I am not a patient person so I will go home and when I press the home  I see a flash of the screen that the app showed this first time, with the search and popular videos and stuff like that.
B005HS00ZU|5.0|I have been a Peter Gabriel fan for years and was not sure if I would like the orchestration. It was stunning. I watched it through twice in 3d before I could turn my system off. The dynamics of the orchestra through my system was exhilarating. Hang on because it is a ride. It was something unexpected for me and I really enjoyed it.
0307277453|5.0|I bought this book to become more informed about evolution and the archaeology and science behind it. This book taught me way more than I thought I was going to learn from it. The author simplifies all the concepts and simplifies it for the average non-science oriented reader. A great read. I would definitely recommend it!
1449430295|5.0|What a great feeling knowing the next year will start out right (and right on time) with a Dilbert a day!
B001O0B702|1.0|boring, just really expected a lot more and then when you get to the end it gets really cheesy. y
B002W7H3EA|4.0|Great movie. Awesome getting to see the on location sites they used. There was some great cinematography. It might be a little long for some people' but I can appreciate an old movie despite the length. Just think of it as A LOT of character development. And it is a Cary Grant movie directed by Hitchcock...So whats not to like?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoy this game. it is very addictive. almost as much fun as the real thing. give it a try
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This really helps me with homework when I need it. Easy to use and  really fun to play on!!<br /><br />-User
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Exceed my expectations and the image is mindbloqing so, what are you waiting for? Buy this awesome movie people! Great
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book needs a little more how can I put this excitement<br />The end was great but a little predictable
B00ECUARO8|2.0|great actors, decent characters, but the story goes nowhere. Not worth committing your time to unless there aren't any good movies to watch.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I really liked this book.  I read it with my mom and i suggest you do too.  I love reading about Theo.
1250012570|1.0|I purchased this book for my grand daughter who is in middle school.  Amazon lists it as a 7th grade book.  Fortunately I opened it to take a look and found the \\"F\\" word twice on page 1.  I will be returning it.  I am no prude, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to find books for middle school readers that don't feature suicide, divorce, death or drugs.<br />Amazon does a very poor job of categorizing by children's reading levels or by what are age appropriate books for kids
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|game is great. watch who you add as friends because there is no way to delete them after. also I wish we could get more tokens to play once you're out you have to wait to scratch a card and even then you might only get enough for 2 games before you're out again. overall though I love playing this uno app. :)
B009NY43NY|2.0|Mostly just rehash of past characters and events to tie up loose ends.  Writing is very poor (not that it was ever great), but this one is especially poorly written.
B0094M2ITG|5.0|The film has a beautiful message. Its characters open up your imagination and encourage you to reflect on various aspects of your life.
B0061US58C|5.0|This creative and very funny movie was enjoyed by everyone in the family. The adults who watched it loved it as much as the small children. We all watched it at least 3 times each.
B00CFYD682|5.0|I've been a fan of Alison Moyet ever since her early days in Yaz.  This album is awesome!  I just got it this week, and I can't stop listening to it.  The lyrics, the melodies, the music - truly haunting.  I can't recommend this CD enough.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|The story grabs you from the start, but the John Corey character keeps me coming back.  He's cynical, obnoxious, sexist, and ridiculously lucky.  And I can't put them down.  Reads like a screenplay.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|nice great wonderful super duper awesome terrific wonderful just what i needed and seller is tops in my book s
B004H4XL7E|5.0|Klaff, hits great points about how to have influence over people. He gets into the psychology and how the brain works. If you are serious about being good at your craft you'll read it once and then go back and create a study out of this book to implement the processes he lays out.<br /><br />Great stuff!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Wish there were an abridged version, although I am reading every word because it really is fascinating information about a flawed genius who made an astounding and positive impact on the entire world.  It is also an excellent guide book for getting great business ideas and insights and the typical problems an entrepreneur runs into.  It really is long though.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|The story hooked my interest from the very beginning. It kept my interest throughout. My only criticism is I felt the ending was a little tame after the excitement all through the book.
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|My son downloaded this app because it was free. He knows what Sudoku is, however, he does not fully understand how to play it.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|What can you say about Casablanca that hasn't already been said.  It was the pivotal movie of it's era.  As far as I am concerned any movie with Humphrey Bogart is a must see and add in Ingrid Bergman and an all star cast and I was hooked.  The streaming HD version was superb.  This was certainly &#34;... the beginning of a beautiful friendship&#34;.  I never get tired of seeing this movie.
B00DB31Y3U|5.0|My son downloaded this free app, because it looked like it involves danger. What can I say boys like games with danger and adventure.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I had a difficult time staying in the storyline, as some of the bits of acting were just plain bad, especially in the beginning, monochromatic, segment of the film. The editing of the scenes seemed &#34;off&#34; as well (example - there is a scene in the beginning of the movie where Franco's character is talking to his &#34;assistant&#34; in his trailer. The door to his trailer swings open, alarming Franco. The clip was edited though such that Franco reacts before the door cues.) I was trying to decide if they were doing that sort of thing with the actors on purpose, making it quite distracting.
B00B1RB942|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen all year.  Great quality and great story.  I only wished for more extras, but the rest is well worth it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is filled with the rich touches of subtle acting and carefully rehearsed movements.  There is no flash and sudden violence or overdone special effects.  This is drama in the careful style that leads one to the emotions, intrigue, and awareness of a world changing so rapidly that all the characters are striving to keep up with the events in which they are involved.  It is the best of television drama.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Amazon's app is awesome! Clean layout and easy to use, not to mention it's Amazon. If you have a tablet and you use Amazon, look no further!
1476733953|5.0|I haven't read a better sci-fi story in a very long time.<br /><br />This is the story of a post-apocalyptic, Fallout style future, but written in a style that captures character, motivation and action in an absorbing, real way. It was simply a book that I couldn't put down. I've already bought his prequel series before I even wrote this review.
B004SVM7BW|3.0|It won't edit much, and I'm not sure how to annotate PDF's using this app - but if you are looking for a full featured office suite this is obviously not going to accomplish that. As far as reading PDF's, though, this app is great!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|GREAT GAME! GREAT GRAPHICS ! Definitely gonna play the next one for sure. It's definitely worth buying. I'd recommend this game for those who love mystery.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan. After going through all of the stories I realized that I was starting to think in a classic old English accent.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|I only knew &#34;Mercy&#34; on this cd when I bought it.  Fell in love with &#34;Rockferry&#34;.  Other songs are nice and mellow.  She reminds me of Dusty Springfield/Petula Clark.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is awesome. Really amazing. You should get it. It kills time and you can kill people's army if you want to.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 11 yr old wanted it on PC but I decided to try the $6.99 version before purchasing full version.<br />Using touchscreen is better than keyboard, so he is hooked.<br />Digital Lego for trips.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Was impressed with the weaving of known historical events and places with convincing fictional dialog.  My first experience with a novel by author.  Was very impressed with his writing skills.  The only thing I didn't like was the title of the book.  I think the word DEVIL as applied to the description of the group that came to America is very misleading.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|I hightly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, especially a Star Trek fan.  This take off is hysyerical.  We watched it half a dozen times and laughed each time.  Tim Allen, Sigorney Weaver and Alan Rickman are great.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the era of Downton Abbey. The series has humor speckled through heart retching drama. I highly recommend it.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The movie started a bit slow but once it moved from land to sea the spectacle began.  The fantastical visuals blurring the line between reality and delirium engrossed me and took me to another place.<br /><br />The ending, leaving the viewer to ponder what actually happened was a nice surprise.  You choose, and then...<br /><br />I've decided to read the book as I've heard it is very rich in detail and will not be a disappointment after seeing the movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend the movie and will see it again if I have an opportunity.
B007SGM084|5.0|How do you read three books in less than a month? You open this set... Kick back and enjoy, relax!!
B005JTAP4S|4.0|Peter: A Darkened Fairytale, firstly a wonderful title and more importantly it holds true throughout the novel. This is a book for children and adults, I admit it took me some time to get used to the speaking animals but the story was enthralling enough that I was soon very comfortable with these wonderfully bright, intriguing and unusual creatures. Of course, there is a dark side, and this I enjoyed very much.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a story about childhood and the approach of adulthood, and the magic that lasts only so long in between.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|It's different. It would be great if you had other animals you could be. I would say this game is mostly in the range of 13 and under but I suggest you try it for yourself.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great writing and acting along with such beautiful scenery keeps you thoroughly involved in the realistic saga  of each character.  Experience all of life's emotions from love and happiness to tragedy and despair.  Superb!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Totally a fan.  What a great way to end the hunger games.  Recommend this series. Think of the good things
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|Back in the 60s, the mono version was the  great.  In the early CD era, I bought the Barenboim version, which is also very good.  I hadn't heard played it for awhile, but when I did, the foam placers had melted into the CDs, completely ruining 3 of the discs. after reading through reviews in Gramophone, I order the stereo version by Kempff. I am completely satisfied.
B000HL2J0G|4.0|i enjoyed the show when it was on the first  time  a little better with no comm I would say buy
B006ICOK00|4.0|Works as advertised, it works and delivers. If people complaining about quality, well if you want professional quality spend the money get a DSLR with lens's and everything. This delivers exactly what they promise 720P video time lapse I got the trigger to do stop motion and it does it decent enough. If you just want to get a taste this is perfect, me and my son gonna have years of enjoyment playing together with it
B00AJLHUA8|1.0|I wanted to like the cool parts of this movie but the 2 minutes of bad guy stuff and 30s at end which you could see coming didn't make up for typical super demanding but ugly mom and kids hounding poor dad who is fameous writer who his wife puts down, as if she could make any more herself, the whiny wakjob.  The son is long hair anti gender role sterotype with tude who yells at dad.  Mighta given ti 2 stars if dad belted he son.  Terrible in a long list of zomg a demon in my baby film hollywood is aborting out now to the dancing of low budget devils.  hope this trend has enuf flops to die fast
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Love it!  Easy to learn and fun!  New favorite!  Thank you!  I will be playing this a lot when I am waiting for my kids' sports practices to wrap up.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Written in her inimitable style, Phillipa Gregory delivers a wonderful read in her latest novel.<br />She ties up all the loose ends and brings previously minor characters to the limelight and makes<br />them shine.<br />Bravo!!!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I was amazed at how candid and honest the members of the band were.  All of them seemed to be honest when talking about why people left.  I enjoyed the DVD very much.  I wish it would have been longer!!!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|this is a great app to have on your tablet! it gives you all the weather information you need at a glance.if you get it you will not regreat it!
B009NOVCTM|3.0|I was very disappointed that they didn't have more new musi on it.  My husband wanted this for the new songs.  I would never have boughten it otherwise.  We have all these songs already on several different discs.  At least Springsteen keeps putting out new music instead of relying on the old songs to keep him going.  The Stones should either write new music or retire!!!
B000BISBDY|5.0|Very nice! Loved the album completely. GO CASH!!<br /><br />I shouldn't have to meet a limit of words on these reviews.
1476734941|4.0|Although you really don't need the book to follow the diet it's still very helpful.  It's really a very easy diet to stay on.  On my fast days it isn't bad at all.  Thought I would be starving but that wasn't the case at all.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|It was lacking in plot and play. Very ho hum what is next on my playlist movie! Very disappointing from such good actors.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|It didn't work.  It did not fix what ever the issue was. It was a waste of money.  Also a waste of time.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Love this series.  A lot like the Grey's series but with much more story line.  Can't wail for more books to be published!
B003477DVK|5.0|It was a warm family entertaining film.  I would highly recommend this film.  we need more of these. thank you
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The story is a long parable, but very interesting and full of detail.  Very thought-provoking.  Makes you examine your own life and think of how you will face your own challenges - and try to be more cognizant of the signs the world reveals to you.  Will we follow our own personal legends (take time to listen to ourselves and be more perceptive) or will we fall into the routine of what we must accomplish to keep afloat in the world?  I think most do not follow their own personal legends - many would think that selfish nowadays.
B004LQGXPA|5.0|Just can't beat the master actor at his best. What a treasure. An immortal performance of a complex character at a cross road of history.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but wouldn't want to read another one like it.  I think I'll stick to adult romance.  It was well written and sad.  I took a new look around my world after reading this, not because of the romance part, but because of the abuse part.  If anyone detects or suspects similar things going on in a child's world, it must be stopped (even if you might lose a friendship for even bringing up the question)!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book will keep you guessing!  I usually don't like thrillers because I don't care about the characters.  This book is different.  I was immediately pulled into the story and couldn't put it down.  It's pretty light and a good beach read.  It's not a terribly complex story, but it is a satisfying and a unique book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great with youtube and netflix if you try to use it with anything else it lags so make sure you only use it with these two programs
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am heartbroken! What a way to end the season! Why is it that the good ones always get it in the end?
B008MM9630|5.0|I have a garden that I love, and magic spells to play with. Keeps me busy!!! And it colorful and fun!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I have to say....there were parts if this book that literally I did not see coming at all. It is well written and overall a good read. But I just didn't love the end....I get it but I didn't love it
B0001ARCFA|5.0|An absolutely unbeatable quality-price ratio. Really nice price and really good sound - very natural, with accurate response for all frequencies; Warm and live bass without any trace of the &#34;anabolic-steroid-like&#34; bass, produced by cans like &#34;Beats&#34; or &#34;V-Moda.&#34; Great sound stage. Perfect for classical music, jazz, progressive and alternative rock. Can't say anything about genres like heavy metal or rap, because I am severely allerged to that staff :). However, good old hard rock (Nazareth, Deep Purple etc.) sounds very good.<br /><br />Comfortable, light-weight - and impressive, as far as the design goes. You meet a person in these cans on a street and you immediately understand, that this person takes music seriously :) At least I flatter myself thinking people have this impression when they see me :)
B004SBX112|4.0|I haven't played it but this game does keep my 4 year old entertained when we are at a doctor's office or the store.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|You'll not recognize your iPod's sound processed by this guy. Amazing clarity, ideal frequency response, zero coloration. Classy sound.<br />One thing though. In order to hear it all you have to: (1) have a good pair of cans and (2) listen to lossless music (like flac, alac, ape etc.)<br />Otherwise, any improvement you will be noticing (with mp3 tracks and with a pair of under-$50 cans) will be more of a self-induced hypnotism.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked it but still unsure about it. This was the first book I read after reading 50 Shades so I didn't love this couple nearly as much as I loved Christian and Ana. That said it was a good read to pass the time but I didn't think much about it after I was done.
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|I bought this album mainly for Thinking About You and Super Rich Kids. The rest of the songs are alright, but these two songs are amazing.
B002436WJE|5.0|Always love Liam Neeson as an actor .... great movie to watch anytime!  Great movie to have in your personal library to share with friends.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Ordered the most recent season of Dexter and selected standard shipping.  Received in only 2 or 3 business days and am very pleased.  Contents of package were in perfect condition.  The wife and I are very excited to get caught upon the second to last season of Dexter since we don't have Showtime.  It is one of the best shows on TV and we're looking forward to seeing the final season!
B004LROUNG|5.0|I didn't think id like the book (I've loved JG forever, but his newer books are not that wonderful). But it had a good pace, a nice plot and a satisfying ending. A nice surprise from an old favorite author.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|All of the posts were extremely slow in showing up on newsfeed,some actually days later !!! Already deleted it !!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey kept me watching every episode! look forward to next season! recommend it highly to others who like British series done well.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|A work of love from start to finish, have read the book many times and felt this movie made the book come alive. Baz put his heart into it.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Real feel but limits your play :( Like that you can play with real people! Wish picture was more clear and more free plays available.
B008KPDKAE|4.0|It was a the perfect movie to watch during our flight to as we began our vacation. It was surprising. My husband even enjoyed it.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This book was chosen my book club and I'm so glad they did.  It was really interesting and because it was a memoir it was even more amazing to read.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I wanted something to watch on our flight home from our vacation cruise. I enjoyed the cast and want to see the sequel.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Enjoyed the show, I don't like ads on TV it interrupts the plot, and are so repetitive and  condescending to adult audiences.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Reminds of the characters in The Big Bank Theory.  funny and clever with a very nice ending which I enjoyed
030759565X|4.0|My book arrived quickly, and although I have not cooked anything from it again, I read and enjoyed the introduction and love the pictures.  As someone who has a very small kitchen, I'm looking forward to trying out these recipes.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I can only say you have to watch Liam pull off this performance as a slightly off key business man you think is bad but is really a great man.
B00846REIS|4.0|I read this serious up to the 3rd novel. It is definitely interesting but I wish the plot would move faster and there to be more danger. The sex scenes are awesome but I could have done with a little less of them and more plot.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I love Ethan Hawke in this movie. He carries the performance right to the end. I would recommend it to all.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I've now played a couple different artifex mundi games and have enjoyed them all. This one is a bit more difficult than the others which I liked. It kept me on my toes and thinking
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I love the interaction between the characters and they always pull it off. Never disappointed in my favorite show. I never thought any show would bump CSI, but move over CSI (since Grisham left), these guys have it all.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|There will be more opinions on this as the days progress but simply put, this movie meets all the requirements of a great film. It has action, suspense, emotion and great acting.  It may not fulfill all the 'Trekkies' life long expectations of what Star Trek should be but then again, what can fulfill those expectations when you compare something that is new to something that has been?  This is a new direction and new journey and should be treated as such. Go J.J. and go new crew!!!!! Awesome movie, can't wait for the next one!
B000HF0J36|5.0|Even though his is a small part in this, I love to see him act. The others are all excellent in their roles, especially like LL Cool J
037571457X|5.0|I love the graphic novel format!  The illustrations and the text complement each other in this text; both are strong and important.  The pictures help bring to life the Iranian culture, which words alone could not do as well.  The text is also powerfully written with good literary techniques.  The ending seems to cut-off at a weird point, but I know Satrapi wrote a follow-up book to this one.
0374530718|5.0|I had to but this book for my Philosophy class and didn't know what to expect. How the story melds a story with class text is genius. I have recommended this book to all my friends just for a good read and I am definitely keeping it. I would give it more than 5 Stars if I could.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is a must for me! I love that everyone can share their ideas about everything! What a great resource tool!
B000HL2J0G|4.0|It was nice to watch the pilot of MacGyver.  To watch MacGyver come to the rescue in stopping a major fiasco. I recommend watching the show.
B005HSL626|5.0|I downloaded the game for my grandson to play while we travel and then he showed me how to play against each other. Now we play back and forth trying to top each other's score. The game is ok to play but the competition with my grandson is priceless!
0385535147|1.0|Grisham usually doesn't let reality get away from him in his stories of legal intrigue. Here he does in spectacular fashion. The plot moves from interesting in the first half of the book to implausible and stupid in the last half. JG even mounts an explanation of sorts in the epilogue, asking readers to suspend disbelief. As well they should.<br /><br />While the author might be a master of his genre, he is no literary giant. Effectively changing narrative styles and bringing off psychological about-faces on a dime take greater talent than it seems Grisham possesses. Some of the final chapters of the novel make so little actual sense that I was ready to toss the book before reaching the final page. One enormous bit of idiocy is the idea that some vastly wealthy drug clan is going to somehow settle for splitting a few million dollars with the novel's protagonist, while passing up untold tens of millions in their highly successful narcotics business. That's just plain dumb.<br /><br />Sorry I wasted a penny on this piece of dreck. Have a great friend who is always telling me that each great author's serious clunker might always be one book away. He almost never buys a book, Grisham's included, but instead borrows them from the public library. After reading this dud I am considering doing the same, at least for a certain writer of legal thrillers.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Oh my what a wonderful book! I learned so much about a part of the world and the evil that prevails there!<br />I simply did not have any idea that political camp even existed!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My family has found this series to quite enjoyable.  Eleven more words are required.  Now I am done, Done,  Done.
B004PYDBVM|5.0|Could not put the book down! Based on a society of equality and fairness, it is all but that!!!!<br />Everyone should put this on their must read list!
1455523003|5.0|Just finished up &#34;The Missionary Position&#34; by Christopher Hitchens. It's an eye-opening look at the life and actions of Mother Theresa, viewed through an analytical, atheistic lens.<br /><br />Hitchens had a distinctly acerbic style of writing, ensuring that he never minced his words. His phrasing, and even his vocabulary, can be dense, and as a fairly well-educated 20-something in the United States, I occasionally had to look up words with which I was not familiar. Still, my biggest fear, that this book would be the misguided rantings of a man bitter toward the religious, was quickly suppressed by this book. The observations were readily defined in their origin, the significance of those observations were deftly brought to light, and in several cases, possibly opposition was brought to light and explained away. The book was thought out in the way that should be expected of the writing of Christopher Hitchens, and in my eyes, should mostly fail to offend even the devoutly religious. It teaches that Mother Theresa had intent to help those that were suffering to mend a relationship with God, rather than to minimize suffering while still on Earth, as evidenced by the story of the tens of millions of dollars in bank accounts, which were not being used to help the poor. She believed that the suffering of the poor was actually beautiful and brought them closer to God, and rather than employing trained doctors and nurses, many of her locations were staffed only by Nuns with limited medical training, lacking even basic strong analgesics, and without many of the medicines that could help the people that resided there.<br /><br />If this does offend you, I highly recommend that you read this book. If it doesn't offend you, I even more highly recommend you read this book.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This is the funnest game I have ever played. me and some random dude were playing it and could not take our eyes off of it. it is so weird to see monkey's fighting and getting knocked out. Akward!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Buy the game totally worth it I mean it is so very addicting I can't stop playing the game like for real
1878424319|4.0|The Four Agreements was a book that I would recommend to anyone that is looking for a different philosophical angle. The service as far as delivery issues was just what someone would expect from Amazon.<br /><br />  Steve
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just watched all 3 seasons and honestly was unable to put it down!  I could NOT tell<br />what was going to happen next and was rooting for certain people...Really good...<br />Wouldnt bother w the cartoon, this is soooooo goood
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Awesome stuff! I installed this game a few days back and I clearly can't get enough of it.  A game with that is lot's of fun.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a fun game.  It will make you think.  Good mind exercise for old and young alike.<br />Very easy to become addicted too.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Young Bilbo is visited by Gandalf. He is invited on an adventure as he is very adventurous (for a Hobbit). After declining the offer he will be visited by a variety of characters and is coerced into a life of a burglar. Will he survive this life and will we after going on the journey with them? Watch and find out.<br /><br />This is the beginning of \\"There and back again\\" not worth viewing until you have the complete story in hand.<br /><br />The story starts off with a token view of our original beloved characters by the original actors. An observation is that the story starts out excruciatingly slow and takes a good chunk of time to get off the ground. Yet this may be on purpose as with any movies it is best to introduce the characters about to take the journey and their Hobbits... Oops their habits.<br /><br />For people that are interested in technology as much as the story presented it may be premature to purchase anything for a while until all the different versions are sorted out. We already have Blu-ray and digital. And by the time you find this review probably 3D so we can watch a lame rabbit sled. Then there is the denser version of Blur-ray, probably another try of smell-o-vision, seat bottom vibrations, interactive-conversations, etc.<br /><br />Avoid using rental services as they are using the crippled (missing all the DVD extras) rental version of the DVD.<br /><br />I can easily go two ways on this presentation. First it tries to fit the general feel of the LOTR movies and the \\"Hobbit\\" book which is really different in character. So this is more of a LOTR prequel.<br /><br /> Having a lot of the same actors helped with consistency, as always we must have new actors; yet that splits the viewers into the two camps of one's following the story and the other's saying this is not the same actors (good or bad). I suggest that it is worth a viewing to decide for yourself.<br /><br />I personally am glad to have had a shot at seeing this now and will again later after the second half is finished.ter after the second half is finished.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Should be for all ages. Love it a lot. American people are awesome to think of this game it is amazing how many pet's are on this game.
B00DB624GS|5.0|One of the best rock and roll records of all time (not pop) and the best Fleetwood Mac record. For those of you who own the original CD - the two don't sound remotely alike. The sound on this (at least on my system) is far BETTER than the original. Sublime. Buy it. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Now, the things I didn't like. I got the CD and saw the running order was different. The UK version. I admit this irritated the heck out of me and I couldn't believe 45 years later they were still mucking around with the running order. After listening to it, it flows. Wonderfully. I like it. I never thought I would. I \\"get it\\". On the other hand, you see why \\"Oh Well\\" was added.<br /><br />Mick's drums sound fantastic - some of the guitar work sounds like the amps are in the room. This is a must have for any Peter Green FM fan. If you don't have the Boston Box, track that down too. Great great band at its zenith.<br /><br />It is very disappointing that it took this long (WB) to release a remastered version. With that said, the wait has been worth it.<br /><br />The liner notes are just OK. I would have done a better job with the layout and some of the credits. A minor gripe and not worth dinging the stars on the review.<br /><br />I wish this band had made more records after this. Check this out.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game is certainly addicting and easy to learn, but the energy constraints made me delete it after 3 days. I would gladly pay $6 for unlimited energy. The game allowed me to play for 5 minutes once an hour
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|PLAY THIS GAME IT IS BEAUTIFUL YOU MUST PLAY IT SO YOU CAN BE BEAUTIFUL IF YOU PAY THIS GAME YOU WILL FEEL BEAUTIFUL INSIDE PLAY THIS GAME TO BE BEAUTIFUL
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Love everything about it, especially the updated smartphone app and website. They've come out with several small updates since I got it, steadily making minor improvements, which I appreciate. My only knock against it, and maybe they can fix this in a next generation model, is it doesn't beep. Mostly that's a problem because it's very small and easy to lose. I've had a couple scares in the last month already. I can't imagine keeping it for 6 months without eventually misplacing it. If it had a beep, when the battery got low, it could start beeping. At least that would give you a chance of finding it in the seat cushions.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I chose this because it's a universal standard for opening PDF files and a necessary addition for my Kindle Fire. Download was a snap and it works fine.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I probably play 2 or three games every time I pick up my Kindle. At this point I'm playing at the &#34;Advanced&#34; level but there are at least 2 additional higher levels I can progress to. One thing I liked when I recently went to Advanced was that the hint area literally walked me through a more difficult way of finding the next number that I needed to place teaching me something I did not already know. I know when I advance up to a more difficult level that will happen again.<br /><br />Play is smooth. You can place the number notes yourself, or the app will do them for you. You can choose when to check for errors and what to do about them when you find them. In hundreds of games it has never crashed or locked up the Kindle.
