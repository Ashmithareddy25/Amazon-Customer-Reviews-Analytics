B0089EHWQE|5.0|What a really well written story.  Amazingly real and definitely touching.  Each of the characters were so well developed that it was if you were reading a true story.  This was a look into a world that none of us AB ever want to experience but should have some experience with as you never know what life may throw your way.  Makes you realize how fortunate we are.  If you don't have someone like Will in your life, I feel sorry for you.
0345525558|5.0|Vanessa Diffenbaugh's debut novel The Language of Flowers was so enjoyable! My lovely, lovely Aunt Kathy suggested it to me and once I started it, I could not put it down. What incredible writing from a first time published author!<br /><br />The language of flowers has always been important to former foster child Victoria. In and out of adopted and group homes, she has never really found her place in the world. At 18, after numerous failed attempts at being placed, Victoria is thrown out into the world to make her own way. She ends up homeless with no place to live and no career to speak of. Having no talents except in gardening, Victoria happens upon a floral shop and practically begs for a job. Flowers have been her only talent and she dives head first into working at the shop and making floral arrangements for weddings. Working with flowers comes as second nature to her and she finally gets back on her feet, working at the floral shop and renting a small room in an apartment with her boss' sister.<br /><br />A chance run-in with a former acquaintance turns her life upside down as she recalls her almost life with Elizabeth, a former foster-mother and almost permanent home for Victoria. Bits of Victoria's past come back in fragments of stories as she tries to take responsibility for her past and control of her future.<br /><br />Victoria is such a gripping character, she's messed up in the head and life has done her wrong, but somehow she manages. She continues to move forward and rarely feels completely inept at living. Victoria's got so much going on in her head and life, it was a blast going through her past and struggling through her present with her.<br /><br />I would suggest this novel to all female readers. It really kept my interest the whole way through! Great story and concept and I really felt that the characters were entirely endearing.<br /><br />-Sarah<br />[...]

B004LWG3ZY|5.0|Norma has not fared well on dvd. The Sutherland video with the Australian Opera has a great performance from Sutherland, but a second rate supporting cast and dreadful staging, sets, and costumes. And the sound fades in and out. The Caballe video live from the Orange Festival has terrible staging and hurricane winds blowing the costumes in everyone's faces, which is quite distracting. The sound is also not very good. Caballe sings beautifully, but her acting is atrocious. The June Anderson Norma is wonderful. She sings beautifully and with great vocal power. And her acting is excellent. The staging, the sets, and the costumes are adequate. And the sound is good.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The finaly book... FINALLY!<br />So thankful that someone stepped up to the plate and finished the work. Like it says, this is the grand finale of the whole series and if you can manage to put it down to go to sleeep, then you are better than I was. I didn't get any sleep for two days.  I had waited three years for the final book and when I started reading it, I just could not put it down. The ending is as twisted as they come. I refuse to give any spoilers, so, if you want to know how it all ends, then you are going to have to read. Do yourself a favor and read the entire series, the books are worth every penny you will spend on them.

B00A8ECU24|1.0|I weathered the other \\"updates\\" okay...but this last one broke my game. I was at level 52, I had spent money on gems, I had bought specialty ponies that required those gems.  Then this update tonight. Ah what fun it has been. first off it crashed in the update and had to restart that 3 times(yeah big surprise) then it finally gets there and it says STRING NOT FOUND. so I click it again...I'm a pro at this after all, and finally after my third poke on the screen of my Kindle Fire it starts...at the BEGINNING. As in I'm back at the stupid \\"elements of harmony\\" video intro to the game...and then it crashed halfway through. I had all of the main 6...I had nearly all the shops, I was past scootaloo and done with the Rarity quests... I was working slowly on the canterlot quests of pony joe...and now I think I lost it all. worse I just paid for Cadence and Shining Armor. ARGH!  When the game works, its great and fun and mildly entertaining...its like any of the 'ville games from zynga...to many quests needs money but fun...and just like zynga crashes often.
0321701763|1.0|Book itself is fine. My intention was to learn the basics of PS 5. I bought the book, but the CD/DVD tutorial was missing/not included and so from that standpoint, it's kinda useless because the CD/DVD tutorial guides you through  all PS tricks, procedures. Caveat emptor.

B0016492BW|5.0|You know the scene: the Pythons riding through the countryside on their faithful invisible steeds, clip-clopping of hooves provided by a lackey clapping coconut shell halves together, in their search for the Holy Grail. They encounter all manner of obstacles and strange characters, from oppressed peasants who object to King Arthur's very existence, to three-headed knights who block their path, to a wizened gatekeeper for whom they must answer three questions, to a killer bunny.<br /><br />Monty Python is an acquired taste, and this is their best film to help in the acquisition. Holy Grail is a highlight of a youngster's coming of age, providing a host of quotes and situations that are referenced forever after: the buxom maiden whom the duke tells his effete son to marry because she has \\"vast [slight pause] tracts of land\\"; the French knights somehow ensconced in a castle in England, who tell Arthur they don't want to join the quest for the Holy Grail because they \\"already have one\\"; the knight who suffers a \\"flesh wound\\" as his limbs are lopped off one by one; and the blessing of the Holy Hand Grenade for use against the killer bunny.<br /><br />The Holy Grail was filmed with modest production values, but the Blu-ray picture quality is surprising, showing greatly improved colors and details. Although not the type of film one watches for reference quality video, it is nonetheless very pleasant to take in all the hilarious nonsense with a better picture. Numerous special features are offered on the Blu-ray, mostly ported over directly from the two-disc DVD edition. Like most Python productions nothing is taken too seriously, not the characters, nor the sets and costumes, and certainly not the story. But this casual appearance should not hide the fact that these guys are seriously funny, their stories endearing, their films memorable. King Arthur decides at one point that they will not return to Camelot just now, because it is \\"a silly place\\". Holy Grail is a silly movie, and it should be visited early and often in hope of finding still further silliness.ie, and it should be visited early and often in hope of finding still further silliness.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|The game is okay but not as entertaining as expected.<br />Constant ad interruptions are not acceptable.<br />Due to the the ads I would not recommend the game.
B001B51B9M|5.0|The Music Man, Meredith Willson's fond remembrance of his early 1900s childhood in Iowa, was one of the most successful transitions from a Broadway musical to a film version. While the movie opened up the scope with street scenes, it also retained many of the stage effects such as isolated singing of duets on a blackout stage, with singers highlighted by spotlights, and soundstage settings like the library and the picnic. The DVD was fine for the era of 26-inch televisions, but the color and fine detail suffered on large modern screens. A Blu-ray transcription was eagerly awaited.<br /><br />No films benefit more from high-definition treatment than old musicals, given that their enjoyment depends heavily on quality sound reproduction, and the accurate presentation of a vibrant color scheme. The Blu-ray edition of The Music Man brings this film to life as it has not been seen since its original theatrical showings in 1962. Compared side-by-side with the DVD, the Blu-ray offers greatly improved video, with sharply resolved fine detail. The 5.1 surround sound does justice to Shirley Jones' beautiful voice in her role as Marian the Librarian, and to Robert Preston's rapid-fire flights of musical fantasy, as he weaves his con-man story of Professor Harold Hill, the Music Man.<br /><br />Many of the finest character actors in Hollywood make up the population of River City, Iowa. Of special note are Paul Ford and Hermoine Gingold as Mayor and Mrs. Shinn, and Ron Howard as Marian the Librarian's younger brother Winthrop. This film is pure enjoyment from the opening credits all the way through to the triumphal march of the 76 trombones at the end. If I seem enthusiastic, it is because this is a perfect high-definition realization of a film that has been my favorite musical since childhood.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Incredible quality game.  Works terrific on kindle fire HD. You can actually play for free, although you could reach goal games faster if you bought coins. Three different types of world's to run through. I have played for about ten hours now and am still discovering new areas within each world. Lots of interesting mini missions and goals to achieve. Having played the game, I would have purchased this for at least $5.
B006HGXGWU|1.0|But we were deceived. The acting was good, exceptional at times. Pacing was deliberately slow, justified by the script and as a means to increase tension. Great build up of expectations. Then there was The End. They offer something marvellous, intriguing and fantastic, but they didn't deliver. What a waste of talent and viewing time. A great Saint Bernard turned out to be a skinny, yapping mutt.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Good story line, good acting, imaginative.  Most of todays Sci Fi is all about CGI and very short on story.  This is a very good balance between the two.  I agree with others, the ending is cool.  Although not a chick flick, they will love the movie.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|A total waste and I won't waste anymore time writing about it. except to meet my word limit for reviews :)
B003G4W49C|4.0|I really enjoyed this book up to the last couple of chapters.  I don't want to spoil anything, but there's a pretty dramatic shift at the end of the story (okay, two shifts :)).
0062206044|1.0|All of a sudden, I started hearing about this book. Everywhere. So I thought, okay, I'm a child trapped in an adult's body, I'll try it. Now I understand by the title that bad things happen. Children's fables are full of bad things happening to good kids and that's okay. The difference is that those fabled kids work through the problem by their reason; even small children can be creative problem solvers. But these children are helpless and don't grow whatsoever in the book. Every good thing that happens to them, albeit however infrequent, just happens. The story rolls along and we're supposed to just accept it.<br /><br />The characters are one-dimensional. I especially hate the treatment the author gives to Violet. She is supposed to be \\"inventive\\" and I definitely noted the sexual bias here. The author says she's inventive but neither treats her that way nor is she even clever enough to help her and her younger siblings. Showing would have been beneficial, instead he tells us and it's not believable.<br /><br />The author tries to tell it in a \\"magical\\" way with his word weaving but it comes out trite and condescending. There is no magic to this book, no special moments between characters, no trust development in adults, nothing. I realize that people are drawn to the pseudonym but it's just a façade.<br /><br />Also, the printed book is shredded on all sides. The pages were frayed on purpose. I checked the bookstore's other books and that's how they chose to print it. It looks like it's been hacked with a rusty saw.<br /><br />This book was adapted for the big screen with Jim Carey playing the evil uncle. I don't know who convinced who to publish this wretched book and create a movie based on it but I suspect a blow job is to blame.

0307887448|5.0|In reading other reviews, watching videos, and generally imbibing supplemental materials as a part of my `research' for this submission, I encountered the word `nerdgasm' that became a go-to descriptor for this tome.  A quintessential quest novel, this account is of a particular quest put upon the world by an eccentric billionaire looking for a worthy heir to his fortunes.  All playing out in an ultra-virtual reality videogame turned day to day interface used for everything from going to school to shopping to entertainment, the quest beckons its participants to locate three keys and three gates after which they will have access to the all-important Easter Egg hidden in the OASIS by its creator.  Our main character is a tragically underfunded yet incredibly skilled `gunter' (Egg hunger) who has every disadvantage, and yet, just the right skills for the quest.<br /><br />I was initially a bit annoyed with the writing - I felt like I was being beaten over the head with obscure 80s references followed by intricate explanations of said references.  Subtlety was not often exercised.  I did, however, take a severe liking to this after just a few chapters.  I found myself reading with my computer handy in order to do additional research on various 80s pop culture (including, but not limited to, watching and/or rewatching WarGames, LadyHawke, Blade Runner; listening to Rush, Oingo Boingo, and Cyndi Lauper).  Much like Wade Watts, the book's hero, and Parzival, his avatar/alter ego - I became obsessed (both with the decade in question and the book itself).  Just barely a product of the 80s, (born in '89) I felt a sudden fondness and nostalgia for an era I never even experienced.  I pined for acid-washed, I longed for feathered and teased, I required analogue and 8-bit.<br /><br />It has been compared to the Matrix, Harry Potter, and so many other iconic stories of the last few decades.  This one, however, is unique.  In our present culture of geek chic, where `Big Bang Theory' is a must-watch and `vampire culture' is an actual thing, Ready Player One shines as both an homage to  our past and a nod to what could become of our future.' is a must-watch and `vampire culture' is an actual thing, Ready Player One shines as both an homage to  our past and a nod to what could become of our future.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works well with it's current limited functionality, enough so that it gives me hope of what can be done with it soon.  Currently music and movies have to be thru Google Play but not on the device - only uploaded or purchased.  It's a start.  Also works well with youtube apps on my iPad, my Nexus 7 and my Droid phone.  Tried working with Chrome browser with some success but much more trouble.  Not really worth pursuing yet.  I'm sure they will get it there.<br /><br />If you are a heavy Play purchaser or upload your music to google play it allows you to send the audio and video through the TV or amplifier.  For the price that's a good start.
B009GI8J1O|5.0|After watching this film, many times, I cannot believe the reception by critics was not much more positive.  Maybe some dont have the attention span to get it, but this movie is amazing.<br />I truly enjoyed all six of the stories, and figuring out how they are all connected.<br />Each time I watch it I pick up something new.<br />Plus, seeing how the same actors are used in each story is also quite entertaining.<br />So, if you want to first be entertained, then be made to think, and finally have some really cool &#34;aha&#34; momemts, buy and watch this film!<br />This movie has become one of my favorites of All Time.<br />Cheers,<br />BSR

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Few books have grabbed my attention so much that I struggle to put it down. This is one of them. A compelling read that by the end  does what it said it would. Powerfully written with strong attention to detail and raw emotion, it left me questioning my own truth's and experiences and changed the way I look at the world around me.

B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King surely isn't someone that would immediately come to mind (especially during the sixties and early seventies) as a soulful singer. And yet, when they finally stripped away the orchestration and concentrated on her, a piano, and limited accompaniment, the result was Tapestry. The songs are wonderfully written and the musical accompaniment is excellent but low key which focuses all the attention on her and the piano. And, of course, on her singing. Her singing is so real, she sings with such passion and courage that it elevates the recording to a very high place indeed. The recording is timeless. I can see from the reviews that it brings back some great memories (and this record dominated the airwaves in the early seventies) so probably anyone growing up then can remember things they were doing while hearing one of these songs. BUT, Tapestry holds just as much power now as it did then - almost all of the songs can be perfectly applied today - and forty years has done nothing to diminish the power and honesty of Carole's singing.<br /><br />Highest Recommendation.

These scientists, whether they explicitly recognize it or not, are seeking the ultimate source. To quote  John Shelby Spong, &#34;...there is something deep inside me, and I suspect deep inside every other person, that requires us to commune with the source of life.&#34; (Why Christianity Must Change or Die, page 197).
B000KITQK2|3.0|You can get some improvement in your acoustic sound with this device, however it takes a lot of tweaking and most of the settings make the instrument sound worse instead of better.  I didn't notice a +20db change in the sound levels to me the were slightly louder at best unless the fader was set to maximum which didn't sound good.  Without a noticeable increase in volume this wouldn't work well as a pre-amp if that is what you need if for.

Other than that, great book :)

As for Morgan Freeman: he is a good actor but I am tired of him playing the same type character in so many movies and having him in any movie actually detracts from it for me now.

B00A0SJWQU|3.0|What were they trying to do with this movie?  They didn't want a remake because its too different from the original.  They didn't want an original because they chose the title and the base plot from the original.  So what was the point?<br /><br />I put the original out of my mind and watched the movie on its own merits and enjoyed it.  But 2 friends I saw it with thought it sucked compared to the original one and could not get past that.  Every scene was a comparison to the original and this movie failed on all counts for them.  Its supposed to be a remake and its not even the same story they said. The whole mars/alien aspect is gone and that was the takeaway from the story they said.  I tend to agree but liked the movie and just wish it had been all original instead of calling it a remake.

I always read them before I pass them along to make sure it's at her level.  She is autistic & reads a great deal.  This one was above her reading level, but I enjoyed it a lot.  I think that even high school children will enjoy these books.
159463176X|3.0|After the first two books and great reviews I had high expectations for this third novel.  No question, the writing is extraordinary and moving and parts of the book were captivating.  But ultimately the narrative and multiple stories within a story ended up more like a collection of short stories than a single story well told.  Worth reading, but my least favorite of the three.  (Note: the first two were off the charts great reads.)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|good stuff, worth repeat viewings.  high production value, nice camera work, beautiful scenery, good acting, all that.  the intelligent soap opera.
B00006HBUB|5.0|This is by far my favorite Scooby-Doo movie ever! I love it so much and was furious when my mother got rid of it. Luckily, that was a VHS, so this one is kinda better. Cheap, fast shipping, and great quality product. I am very satisfied! Now how does the theme song go again???
B006MW3UZW|5.0|i can't get enough of Downton Abbey!  I love watching how the Crawley family lived, while watching the drama unfold!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game! Keeps me busy and is very addicting! I would definitely recommend this game for children and adults.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|You cant go wrong with this series!  We never get tired watching it..always picking up new details we've missed or forgotten.  A must have for true Dexter fans.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|We've only watched the 3D version, which was really fun.  There were only a couple parts that really took advantage of the 3D, but that's more a knock on the movie and not the product itself.  Overall very satisfied with the product and how well it works.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This is the best game ever it's so easy n a cool game to play try it u will like it
B00CE03UOC|5.0|simple and addictive. love it and all the other Flow games. doesn't matter how old you are. lots of fun for all ages!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the kids love this game i think i'm going to try it out myself.  it will keep the little ones busy for a looong time!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is so easy to use. It has over 20 different versions that you can choose to read from. I am not the best reader when it comes to the Bible because I get confused easily but the different versions make it easy to choose which one works best for you. Also, you can highlight verses and bookmark them with a keyword and reflection. It allows me to become deeper in my faith because I can understand what I am reading! It has different reading plans so if you are looking to release anxiety, it puts together chapters and verses that relate to anxiety. This has to be the best Bible app that there is.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game, some items take a while to collect but still enjoyable. Tasks are not too difficult to master and seem to increase as you play.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is great to pass time. I find myself getting into it really quickly. I like the different game modes it offers too.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|There has only been a hand full of albums that have covered so much social issues yet kept you captivated through out it's entire play. I must say that Rodriguez nails it; musicly, lyricly, and takes you for a ride. That is, if you are willing to listen.<br /><br />Truely &#34;Coming from Reality&#34;<br /><br />Puro Sixto Rodriguez!<br />Y-Que.
B000FC1MCS|3.0|At first I thought it was going to be a very slow and boring book, but it was actually so weird; I started to read it to my family one night and they thought it was funny and I should read it to them some time next time I see them. I enjoyed the plot of the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My older brother and i love to play this game. Some times we have a comparison to see who gets a better scare
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is the finest television show I have ever watched.  Absolutely love the scenery, the acting, the story, love it all.
B000FBJHT4|5.0|Wow, love how real life finally top's the fiction novels. Expert testimony on what happened in Area 51 and after.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I took me a few pages to get acclimated to the style, but I'm glad I didn't let it stop me from reading this amazing book.  Poetic and insightful as well as a good read, damning and hopeful of the human condition at the same time. Looking forward to seeing how in the world they can translate all of that into a film - hope they do it justice.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Cute movie well worth the time spent to watch it. Some lag toward the end but in all a good movie.
B005VPRG10|5.0|I wouldn't know, but I'm sure my Grandson would say it's teriffic.  He plays with it all the time.  Legos never wear out
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Had it for 2 years, then new version came along. Have struggled with it, can hardly read it with new ads and irrelevant pictures. Can not find hourly forecast. It is useless now. I just go noaa.gov now. Am uninstalling it.
B009X01C64|4.0|I purchased this directly from the manufacturer (strongly suggest you do the same for significant savings AND fast shipping) and really like the cover.  It is very sturdy for protection, looks and feels great.  The improvement that needs to be made is the lack of a snap or some method of securing the device to the cover.  After you snap the device into the plastic case the plastic case can swing in and out of the cover.  If you walk anywhere with the case open there is risk of it swinging and slamming into something breaking the device.<br /><br />For me personally this is not much of an issue, knowing this is a possibility I am always careful to ensure the case is closed and secure when moving.  However making that small improvement would net a 5 star rating for me....<br /><br />Highly recommend (just be careful)....
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I got this as it was offered as a free app of the day. For fee, I could say is good and entertaining. It is basically the same throughout all the levels, for each level, you get to choose to build your stamina, speed and strength.  Each level become a little harder so you need to train for Strength, Speed and Endurance depending on what you will need to beat your opponent.  After you built all your asset to the max then the rest of the fight becomes easier.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|With RED2 coming out in theaters, we decided to rent this first.  We had never even heard of it before.  Good fun though!  The whole family (two teenagers) enjoyed it.<br />Then we had to have a family night out to see RED2.  (enjoyed that as well).
B00190N4E4|5.0|This movie is very interesting as it shows some of Gandhi's philosophies. My favorite line from Gandhi, and I paraphrase, &#34;people need to solve the conflicts with the devil's in their hearts.&#34;
B008476HBM|5.0|Oh, I love Jane Austen's writing, wit and sense of humor. Her characters could also live in modern times. A smart woman, ahead of her time.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Can't make the connection between the title and the songs, but, hey, that's Donald Fagan for you.  He just continues to make terrific music;  His band is outstanding, as well.
1616960922|5.0|The Emperor's Soul (2012) is a standalone Fantasy chapbook, but is set in the same world as [[ASIN:0765350378 Elantris]].  It contains a single original novella.<br /><br />In this novella, Wan ShaiLu is a Forger.  Shai uses magical stamps to change the outward and inward attributes of something.<br /><br />Gaotona is a Imperial Arbiter, the top level of administrators.  He has been a friend of the Emperor for decades.  Unlike most imperial servants, he is an honest man.<br /><br />Frava is the Head of the Imperial Arbiters.  She is about as corrupt as anyone else in the Empire.<br /><br />In this story, Gaotona listens to his fellows argue over what to do.  The Emperor and Empress were attacked and severely injured.  The Empress died, but the Emperor was saved by the resealers.  Unfortunately, his mind was wiped out of the brain.<br /><br />Frava wants Shai to Forge the Emperor's mind.  For maybe the first time ever, Gaotona agrees with her.  The other three Imperial Arbiters concur.<br /><br />Frava commands the Imperial Guard to bring Shai to their conference.  Shai had been caught Forging an imperial artifact and is awaiting execution.  She has only a day left to escape her cell.<br /><br />The guards open the cell door in the ceiling and send down a ladder for her to climb.  As she walks through the palace, Shai realizes that she isn't going to her execution.  Then she is presented to the Imperial Arbiters.<br /><br />This tale has Shai agreeing to the Forging of the Emperor's soul.  Refusing would only bring her immediate death.  The task is interesting and what does she have to lose?<br /><br />Shai grows to like Gaotona and dislike Frava.  She starts interviewing people who know the Emperor.  She is fascinated by his life and soon becomes determined to succeed for his sake.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Sanderson fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of Asiatic cultures, political intrigue, and a unique magical form.  Read and enjoy!<br /><br />-Arthur W. Jordin
0765325950|5.0|I have read the whole series and was very happy to read the last book!  It was well written and a wonderful end to a fantastic series!!
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|it is a great movie to add to the Iron Man franchise :)  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the most out of the 3, but I know everyone has their own tastes in movies.  I write this review because I really like this movie, but, in my opinion, reviews are generally useless.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|The best part of the show was the photography....A pleasure to watch and a fun story to see too!<br /><br />I am glad to see some good quality movies coming out today..
B000051SAY|5.0|If you don't like Celine, too bad.  It is a great CD and with the live performances it is even better than I expected.  Great purchase... 4 me..
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I use this with my Shure SE215's and I feel like the each instrument becomes crisper and clearer on the blue setting whereas the red setting will increase the base output.  Purple kind of blends the two and I can't say that I care for it too much.  Sorry if my explanation is lacking but I picked this up for $25 and it's definitely worth the price.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Arrived in great shape, packed very well and I was astonished at the clarity, I had the original DVD, this is much better and you will love the extra that come with the package.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Yes its still fairly new. But lets see what this thing can do. I wish it was 1080p too. Google please bring on the apps for this gizmo!
B0058EBNAO|3.0|No instructions ya just have to fool around with it, and kinda guess how it works. I wouldn't call it user friendly--however it is definitely a technical piece of software (which is good).  There's just no pointers as to how to broaden the functionality that I'd assume it's capable of.
B00992CF6W|5.0|really good I mean seriously who wouldn't love it it is almost exactly like minecraft and I am looking forwards to realms a lot too!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this battery app a bunch. Because it gives percentages of charge, you don't have to guess how much you have. bravo---nice graphic, too!
0066620996|5.0|If you have a job anywhere, YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK! The wisdom in this book is essential reading material for anyone that has a job. Beyond doing the right thing, which we all need to embrace, this book offers business wisdom that is legendary. Chances are, your boss has read this book and if you read it, you will magically start speaking your boss's language! It's difficult to argue with the truth when it confronts you. This book is an invaluable guide to anyone trying to get ahead on the job. I use it in my own business.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Smooth interface, entertaining visuals, and creative puzzles! My only complaint is that it is short and simple enough to complete in a single sitting if you're dedicated. I look forward to the next installment!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I don't want to bash this app. Some of the features don't work properly though. I can only share on my own timeline, I have to click on the back button several times to get back to my news feed when clicking on a link, and other things I can't remember right now. Otherwise, the app is alright.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved every minute of the room.. The suspense of wanting to know what was next was thrilling. I just wish it was longer..
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo I have ever played. I play it everyday and send invites to all my friends.
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|Worked great until Google shut down the servers for their reader.  I haven't been able to get it to work since.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great device for $35.  Hopefully we'll see more providers move towards this like Amazon Instant Video, HULU, etc.  I've been using the device almost on a daily basis and have had zero issues.
B007QJ8VBI|5.0|Great movie - I really only love the old ones...there isn't one thing that compares today. Not kidding.  End of story.
0783225547|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and it has been watched so many times it's crazy.  Plus, who doesn't love Pierce Brosnan in this particular movie.  It's got everything that makes a good movie: good actors, action and suspence, great story line, and romance.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game. The visual scenery is great and the fun level is through the roof. In order to upgrade your shark you must feed him and collect hidden treasures . It really is a funny game and you really don't have to spend real cash to enjoy the game. I say get it and give it a try. Works great on the Kindle HD.
B004UJTG6Q|1.0|This book sucks, but I had to read it for school. I hope you didn't have to read it. :)
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|Great and fun family time! Just what you'd expect from this sort of movie. Would highly recommend for the kids.
B009AY04A8|4.0|The game only went to level 15 and then expects you to purchase the second half of the game. I like games from the organization, but I don't appreciate this.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I watched with my husband since the second movie came out and I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. Pretty hilarious with a semi predictable plot.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I like this app a lot it is entertain and fun I have Emoji on my iPod and on my kindle fire
B00BJ7G1VK|5.0|This cookbook and show has inspired me to learn french cooking.  I'm slowly making my way through the cookbook, so far everything has turned out great.  It's Rachel Khoos' easy twist on French Cooking.
B007L96SI6|5.0|Haley has a nice bluesy flair in her voice that I enjoy listening to at the end of an evening.  I would buy more of her music.
0375842209|5.0|I love this book. It was so well written. It's definitely in my top 10 list. Not just for young adults!
0142421715|5.0|Shipping was great I did order this book before I finished the first one and I could not put it down. The trilogy is is amazing and the condition the book came in was way better than I thought.
B00000JNJ1|4.0|FACES-GOOD BOYS...WHEN THEY'RE ASLEEP/THE BEST OF FACES:<br />FACES' brand of slop bucket booze-fueled blooze rock, helmed by incomparable front man ROD STEWART's raw, soulful husk of a voice and RONNIE WOOD's sinewy guitar licks was a heady mash of RNB, country and folk...which made 'em the seventies' most famous bar band. The reflective brilliance of OOH LA LA, POOL HALL RICHARD's swaggering boogie and that classic hard rockin' kiss-off STAY WITH ME (featuring one of the most memorable axe intros of the era) are just some of the high-life highlights on BEST OF, a generous nineteen track sampling distilled from their career spanning box set FIVE GUYS WALK INTO A BAR. Drummer KENNY JONES, bassist RONNIE LANE and keyboardist IAN MACLAGEN...all seasoned vets of SMALL FACES till leader STEVE MARRIOTT defected to HUMBLE PIE...rounded out this reckless party-hearty ensemble. Eventually overshadowed by STEWART's burgeoning solo career (on which WOODY played a healthy part), FACES were that all too rare entry in rock music...a bunch of mates having a hell of a good time, all the while refusing to take themselves too seriously.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR LADS
B00CXQL828|5.0|Great super-group, a  nice combo of classic and modern sound with some killer riffs dashed about. The grooves they lay down are catchy and fairly laid-back compared to the heavier stuff I listen to. Nonetheless, it's a pleasing departure.  More of a &#34;radio play&#34; band compared to what Portnoy has done in the past. I hope it's successful for them because this group of old pros deserves it 100%. DON'T STEAL THEIR MUSIC! Support these guys and BUY their album!
B000FBJAOG|3.0|I first read World War Z and really enjoyed. I felt it was a fresh take on the overplayed Zombie Apoclypse. I gave that one 4 stars. However, Zombie Survival Guide, which was written before WWZ, has it's good moments and it's lousy ones. There were a handful of parts in the book where I felt as if I were on a life raft in the doldrums. &#34;Somebody get me out of here!&#34; Other parts I wanted to take notes just in case the apocalypse really happened. ***Semi-Spoiler Alert: I started eyeing things differently. I'd ask myself, &#34;How hard would it be to chop down the staircase that leads to my front door so that zombies couldn't get to it.&#34; And other things like that *** Overall, I recommend to any Zombie fanatic who can't get enough.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Watched seasons 1-9 more than once. Awesome show! Best ever. Has me hooked! Every time I watch it, I notice a new detail I missed the first time around.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Authors ridiculous public comments aside, I couldn't put this book down! Without being able to help it, I found myself investing in Ender's fate. I was able to relate to him and his struggles even though it was a futuristic science fiction novel. Instead of it being a copy of a story that has already been told a million times, I found Ender's Game to be quite refreshing and original for its time. The only thing that I would have liked to have seen different was the ending. I felt it was a bit abrupt and hurried. I'm really looking forward to reading the rest of the Ender Quintet.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love it and so does my 6 year old. We can't get enogh of it! always new challenges and new tricks to do. Keeps us thinking
1594204217|5.0|If you cook or eat, this is a must read!  It will change the way you think about what you eat and you will never be the same again.
B004DMAZQK|5.0|White Lies are amazing.  They are one of the greatest rock bands of our day in my opinion.  No one I've ever had listen to their music has had anything bad to say.  Its too bad they don't get more publicity than some other music artists that are just ridiculous.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|It bounced around too much, story was a bit boring I did not even finish the books which was a shame as I usually do.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Not quite Pride and Prejudice, but still a great show that is more addictive every time I watch it. Watched all 3 seasons in a week!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Excellent movie! Told it like it was!  Great directing and full of suspense from beginning to end! Not only an excellent director but great actor!
B0013FSL3E|2.0|Love this movie but unfortunately we chose to get a used one and the disc's sound stops throughout the movie.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|Plot is stupid and scenes don't seem to belong together.  It's as if by blowing up enough vehicles and seeing Bruce Willis bleed from various wounds is enough to sell this movie.  Not so..I loved all the other Die Hard movies.  It is a shame also, as the actor who played his son is a very good actor..he just didn't have a good script.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|good to train your vision and hand speed .  will recoment to everyone !!! even my 4 years  old daughter  love it so you will love it to
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I like it because I can use it to charge my Kindle.  A 5ft long cable makes it more convenient than a short one.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game to pass the time in the waiting room.  Does get challenging as the game progresses. Kids love it too.  Neat to see the kids of today enjoy Retro fitted games
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My son LOVES bouncing up and down and playing in this jumperoo! The music is fun and upbeat and the colors are bright and cheerful. It was really easy to put together, and the fabric seat insert is easy to take off (and put back on) for washing. I was a little apprehensive at first about spending so much for this item (for $100 I was hoping he would really love it!! -- thankfully he does!), but it was SO worth it! This has been one of our best purchases for our baby! :)
0783240287|5.0|This movie is great. I love the actors, I love the songs, I love the story, and I love the way it was filmed.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I've read the Reacher series. I love it. Criuse is not reacher. He doesn't even come close. He's just a producer who wanted to make a movie. It's a fair movie, not good, not bad. Not much of a developing plot, not much in character development. It's got some action scenes and the fighting is close to real, but Tom just does not need to be a driver in that movie. He is not even close, which is surprising, since he knows better.<br /><br />Anyhow, it's ok, but no matter what it's not a Reacher story. If you love Tom Criuse, it's ok, so go ahead and watch it. If you love Reacher, you might not love this.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie was so funny. I really enjoyed all of the witty lines. It was definitely college kid humor, but still very enjoyable.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is ok. Temple Run still outdoes this game, but there are different target crowds I think. DM: MR is for a younger crowd and Temple Run is for a wider, and perhaps, older crowd that can do the hard challenges posed. This app just seems to target children.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I love this music. It is catchy, current, and full of musical talent. Many of my favorite songs are blended together with voices that I love as much as other favorite artists. I look forward to the actors releasing more good music!
B00E6D4HHO|1.0|I was so angry when I opened the package. I knew something was wrong when it felt so light in my hands.<br /><br />I mean, obviously I didn't buy this for the movies, who hasn't watched all the movies already? Duh? I thought it would be great to add to my \\"Everything Hugh Jackman\\" collection in my garage.<br /><br />FIRST, unlike what was described on the box, I DO NOT SEE ANY ADAMANTIUM ANYWHERE. Did I get a dud, or is this a blatant rip-off?? I knew $129 was too good to be true, when an extremely rare metal like adamantium would probably cost more than its weight in gold.<br /><br />SECOND, after sniffing the claw, I do not smell any of Jackman's sweat. Is this even an authentic Wolverine claw? On close inspection, I did not even find a single strand of body hair or skin flake.<br /><br />I am thinking of returning the package when my cousin returns the discs after finishing the last movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|There were some changes from the book but mostly it went right along with it! And if a movie is based off a book. I like it to be as close to the way the author envisioned as possible. They did a good job of staying within it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This was a gift for our grandchild. They love it. It has worked well with no problems. I would recommend it.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|you will enjoy this book.... like most of his books ... harry bosch is his normal great self here in overlook
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I love the story of this book. The exchanges between the main characters is wonderfully entertaining. This book truly sheds light on the inner workings of a controlling relationship. Very enlightening.
B008Y7IP0S|2.0|In addition to beings 2 hours long, this movie is pretty boring. The last 30 minutes must have been what I latched on to add a kid.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have to really, really like a movie before I'll buy the DVD, which is why I own probably less than 15 DVD's. I saw this movie in the theater and really enjoyed it, and in Blue-ray 3D, it is AMAZING! Bought this right from Amazon, price was fair and delivery was about a week.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|A real old fashioned thriller that keeps you turning pages and thinking you have it figured out. Not quite sure why the famous detective in all this genre are alcoholic, neurotic, somewhat disturbed but supposedly brilliant men with serious women and self loathing issues, but it works. They are more than heros. They and their neuroses become an integral part of the drama played out.<br /><br />Harry Hole attracts or is it is attracted to the bizzare and clearly the most psychotic bad guys. He reads them almost as if he has been there. His brilliance and at times almost brilliance as he tries to piece together the puzzles keeps you turning pages trying to assist him. Or keeping trying to figure it out yourself. But Nesbo is the master of  the surprise.<br />.<br />The Bat led me to the Snowman. Both compelling<br />Not sure if a third book might not be too much of the same. We shall see. Worth exploring.
B00C5ZORES|3.0|Feels like a ________ (see above) effort. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase and about 4-5 of the songs will make it on my playlists.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a very funny little game to play to pass the time after the kids go to bed.recommended for quick stress reliever.
B0041VB8BO|5.0|I found this album because I was looking at the commercial success of their latest release. But for me, this album trumps the newest by leaps and bounds. At Least I'm Not as Sad As I Used to Be and Light a Roman Candle are going to be in my favorites for awhile.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I enjoy the well thought out plot and twists. I like the current themes Mr. Forsyth uses to mix fact with possibility.
B007MAETA8|4.0|but that's okay. I like cruising to it when I need to settle down. It puts my wife to sleep at times. Still think there are several decent tracks on it. Personal favorites- Something like Olivia and Queen of California
0307346617|5.0|I must say that this book is great! It describes perfectly the context of many scopes of the society before and during the war. The type of writting, interviews, make it feel like it really happened. I haven't finish it yet, but it promises a great ending.<br /><br />The feel of the cover (paperback) is soft and nice, and it prevents of being scratched by placing it on many surfaces. The paint has fallen from a few edges, but I consider it normal caused by the use.
B007JCP8FE|4.0|bought this after listening to the album on a long flight. amaryllis is a standout track and there are a few songs that would do well played in a stadium atmosphere. I will continue to monitor this band's releases.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was really disappointed.  I liked the other Crossfire novels, but I thought the whole time I read this one, that it could have been a one chapter book.  I did a lot of reading, but there was NO interesting content.
B000J5XS3C|2.0|The frame was warped.  The electrical connection isn't secure and is prone to disconnecting.  My background information says that this is a reliable product of sound quality.  My first experience with it doesn't meet those expectations.
0064471837|5.0|I chose to read this book by literally judging it by the cover. Beautiful artwork. I don't live in an country where English is spoken but had just discovered a library with books of foreign languages. I browsed the shelves and it caught my eye. Read the summary and decided to give it a go. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />The most important part of the book for me was the main character: Sabriel. For me it was so great to read about a strong and smart young girl who was also independent and no-nonsense when it came to guys. It's getting rarer in literature these days. There was some romance but that was not the focus and not drawn to the forefront. In my opinion it was good that the book wasn't about that. It was about helping people, trying to save the people you care about and discovering who you really are and what you're capable of. There was a lot of courage and strength in the main characters of this book.<br /><br />The book itself was very well written. There was always something to keep your attention and no pointless dragging on and on.<br />The greatness of the Old Kingdom, the Charter magic and the beautiful necromantic bells and so much more. Garth Nix manages to bring that world so alive. Especially the bells, that when they ring in the story you could almost hear the extraordinary sound. Except the last bell, the seventh. Astarael the Sorrowful, that casts all who hear it into death... Best not try to hear that.<br /><br />I loved Touchstone (although I didn't get why that is a fools name), his actions and personality. Mogget was a bit more interesting. I guess it's difficult for an ordinary male character to compete with a talking cat. Mogget was also a lot more than that because it was difficult to see if he was good or bad, never could tell his intentions or agenda. He always managed to keep me guessing and I loved that not to mention the sassy comments and attitude.<br /><br />I hope people read this book and the others in the series. This is an amazing fantasy book that in my opinion is underrated and should definitely have the same success like the Harry Potter books.<br /><br />I'm so sad that it still hasn't been translated into the native language of my country, I could recommend it to everyone I know.ing fantasy book that in my opinion is underrated and should definitely have the same success like the Harry Potter books.<br /><br />I'm so sad that it still hasn't been translated into the native language of my country, I could recommend it to everyone I know.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game and its possible to go through the whole game without spending your own money.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Awesome movie great action but for adults only! I would not suggest letting a child under the age of 14 watch this!
B00BYM5I1O|4.0|Amongst all the wannabee's this 'Guy' stands out as having lived and worn every mile! Even the un-trained ear could hear that!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This remote control app allows use of your high performance desktop machine anywhere you can get wifi or 4g service on phone or pad.  I use regularly to status video production renders & start new ones.  Even while away on trips!  Sometimes gets a bit cranky when rendering or viewing 1080p 60 fps. Mp4 files.  Probably desktop load on older i7 930 cpu.  Still amazing &  useful.<br /><br /> Note offsite use requires reasonable recurring access charge.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Not always credible, but charming.<br />Implausible healing of a severely damaged young girl, who finds herself through magic with flowers.
B00C2UUPQA|5.0|Whilst Roger Bushell is your typical British spirit, he was in fact South African. However, he came to symbolise that great British attitude that won them the war - the Blitz spirit. This is a great story about a truly great man and of course, his leading 'BigX' role in The Great Escape. But it's also a story of sadness given the results of his romantic dalliances in Prague particularly and indeed, at home. It's a story for boys of courage and derring-do. It's a story of how an evil Nazi regime was brought slowly, to its knees, by people like Roger Bushell. However, it's a story that so well written, so well researched and so easy to read, it typifies the comment \\"unputdownable\\". It's just that. Get it, read it and be enthralled. Magnificent.
B00E7PQVHK|4.0|I took a chance on this game reading that it works on Kindle Fire HDs (I have the 8.9) and glad I did. The first time I launched the game, it hung at the opening screen and was afraid that it wasn't going to work. I reinstalled it and ran it again. At first it seemed to hang again but I just started tapping around the screen to try to maybe call up the app's menu or something. Not sure what I did but the game finally got through to the menu to start the campaign. Maybe it just need to extract resources? Some games do that. *Shrug* I don't know. But anyway....<br /><br />The puzzle-style battle system is the first I've seen of this kind.I usually play JRPGs and Zelda type RPGs, but I really like this change of style. You line up same type and same colored mythical battle units that charge up and have different attack or defense styles. How you group them will also determine strength or defense and bonuses you get. Placement of these groupings opposite the groupings of your opponents is also important. It was challenging for me at times, but I like the strategic elements. I'm not that good at it yet, but enjoy it enough to want to get better at it.<br /><br />Production values are good: graphics are nice and its music, sound effects and voice-overs in the introduction are well done. I'm at the beginning of the story so far so not sure yet how well written the plots and themes are - seems pretty good so far.<br /><br />Another reviewer had mentioned that the game closes when you attempt to flee from the battle. That happened to me one or two times, but not too often.<br /><br />Other than that minor glitch, I think this RPG is pretty good. If you have the Kindle Fire HD and want something different from the usual ones, give this a try!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I love this it is good for my kindle and daughter's kindle it long and able to use it in my car change.
1449410243|4.0|Great book, very funny! Great gift for the cat lover with a good sense of humor. I definitely recommend it.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book is that adorable romantic teenage love story that every one likes to read every once in a while I would highly recommend it and personally I can't wait to read the next one :3
B0080MPUUK|5.0|Casablanca as Woody does an homage. Diane is wonderful, and I don't know who Bogart was but he was great.
1936891026|5.0|love this book!<br />Pressfield puts in perspective a battle youve been involved in, and for most, haven't known much about. Definitely worth reading if you have any creative passion you feel needs release. Some writers get to work when inspiration strikes, and thanks to this book, it hits me every morning at 9am.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I love this movie.  My dad and I started watching it on Christmas Eve after everyone else had gone to bed. I thought it was about time to upgrade from our usual VHS version for the DVD.  This DVD is near perfect. It is clear as a bell, and the audio is great.  The set I bought contains the black and white version, and the colorized version.  Even though I am a purist, I was curious about the colorized version.  I could not watch five minutes of it! It may just be me but I found it distracting.  I may be just so used to black and white, that it just really bothered me.  Anyhow, I was very pleased with my purchase, and now that I have it on DVD, I have found that I slip it in to watch it more often than just at Christmas time, and I never grow tired of it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for Christmas or any time of the year, you just need a good pick-me-up movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We started on Suits Season 1 during the rainy season & love it.  Characters are new to us, the fact that we are now on season 3<br />tells it all, we look forward to watching every chance we get.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|this app is wonderful. I totally enjoy it. Would highly recomend this app for all who are considering it. thank you

B006GWO5NE|5.0|It worked wonderfully. Am totally pleased! would highly recomend this product.  I couldn't believe the difference from your product compared to the other
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am ABSOLUTELY addicted !!!! I love this game !!! I love that I can see everything and play at the same time. I love that I can trade gifts and help out my friends when they are in need of help !!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|wonderful app for searching all kinds of things. anything you can imagine is right there at your finger tips. its great
1423140591|5.0|Riordan is definately evolving as a writer. The first Percy Jackson book was not that well written, nor the next two after that. The movies do not really adhere to the books either but Hollywood has to make a buck!<br />As Riordan has moved on with the Percy storyline the books are getting better.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|absolultely love this app.  keeps me in touch with so many friends who without this app i would have never found
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Had a couple gliches, but overall I am pleased with the Chromecast's performance.  It is a good value, and great if you use Netflix alot, which we do.
B008XG1X18|5.0|such a fasinating app. There are so many wonderful pictures and solutions for things. its a wonderful app to have
B000PMLFRA|5.0|It was a fun trip down memory lane.  Special effects have come a long way since then.  Never realized how much cardboard there was on the death star back then.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The book as very interesting.  I could not lay it down.  I recommend this to all readers who just want to relax and enjoy
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good story, just a bit too much violence for my taste. Nevertheless, for those who love action flics with happy outcomes, this is one to watch.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Intricate style, yet distinctive Satriani. Every album, this one included, is impressive and unique, with dynamic and powerful solos, themes, and harmonic chains that one gets to appreciate more with every replay of the album. It is as if there are hidden gems that you will keep discovering as you let yourself immerse into Satriani's music and enjoy his superlative talent.
B00012QM86|5.0|This is one of the alltime best classics.  It has a great message that should never be forgotten.  Keep our younger generation informed of the great injustice to the Jewish people, just because of their race.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Good time waster lots of levels was free but would pay if not to expensive, tests your memory a nd brain
0061989142|5.0|Book was in great condition, I didn't even see finger prints on the black pages. Besides the great condition of the book, it was really a nice read!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|This was way too hard for me to figure out how to make the game work.  I lost interest in it very easily.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Why for this app need internet? Only 2 stars for questionable permissions. There is absolutely no need to be connected to the internet for a game like this. A multiplayer option where your opponent played the aliens would be fun. Gameplay is solid though.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is lots of fun and the music is great.  Getting to figure out what kind of costume you want is fun too.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Temple Grandin is our hero. After viewing this movie and the interviews with it we were touched greatly by the things we could learn about autism. We were in tears through much of the movie. We highly recommend this movie.
B0090SI3ZW|4.0|If you are looking for a fun, thought-free, violent kung fu romp, look no further. This movie is formulaic in all the best ways, reminding me of how much I love the old school kung fu movies. I won't be watching it over and over, but I will be pulling it out after some drinks when I have the urge for some kung fu action.
B0079R8KXG|3.0|This cover is okay. It hold my KF nicely but it isn't very stylish or polished. It looks cheap. It will be adequate for my upcoming travel.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This movie does not fail to entertain from beginning to end. I would have preferred a bit more character development and making us aware of their individual motivations would have helped. But all in all it was a very entertaining flick that lives up to its billing!
B003QSLW0K|2.0|Not a big fan of political correctness, especially in cartoons....seems like subtle indoctrination of children, but what do I know?  I'm just a parent, grandparent, veteran, business owner, volunteer for the homeless, and active in community affairs.
B006212C66|5.0|Season is starting to make more sense. I think its pulling together & going to be amazing. I love how it's not a long drawn out thing. It's unforgettable!! It's addictive and I'm not stopping until I reach the end. LOVE IT!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think the game is really fun. It can entertain for hours and hours. I like how you can get better at your score and compete against your friends. Over all it is an outstanding amount of fun that should be shared with everyone.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Malkovich was incredible as were all the other lead actors! I can't wait for RED II to come to DVD.
B008ETOSYI|3.0|She loved it and has watched it several times since.  It was just okay for me, I felt like the characters did not have enough substance.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|IAP for a damn purchased note pad app!  No thank you!<br /><br />Can you say scam?  This is a rip and I will never use this company again - FaotD or not.<br /><br />Uninstalled....
B001F4UHFI|4.0|I am rating this one for my husband as I did not watch it.  He said it was ok, not exactly what he thought it would be.  An ok movie for Cage, but he hasn't watched it a 2nd time.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|It is confusing.  The book has to be paid very close attention and it has a strange, dark side and was confusing at times.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|What can you say about Jane Eyre?  It is a classic love story that still resounds today and this movie was great.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|My husband bought these cards for my Zelda themed birthday party, and i love them. The cards feature artwork from 4 different Legend of Zelda games so any Zelda-nerd should love them!! I do!!
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|Have watched this movie several times with my teen daughter.  It is one of her favorites, I like it as well.  The acting could be better, but other than that it is a great family movie.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Y,know, if you've seen other films from Quentin Tarantino and you LIKE them, then this movie will satisfy your splatter cravings. Good story under it all. I left with my stomach full of popped corn and my cathartic nature totally expended. Ahhhh!!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I am a huge fantasy reader and was interested in this book. The story could have been good if only I could get past all the editing issues and the fact that this author can't write a paragraph longer than 3 sentences. All these short tiny paragraphs make me speed read through the story thinking something big will happen and i can slow down soon. Nope, never.  Its just an uncomfortable read with errors that throw you off. Don't waste your time and money. NOT WORTH IT! My suggestion to the author... take it back to the drawing board and get an editor. You have a potentially good story but this writing is atrocious.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|This is a raw, unblinking look into the stark world of a killing machine who, in ANY OTHER WORLD, would be a lovely teenager searching for a good college to attend; partying, hanging out...<br /><br />Hanna's been trained by her father from the time she could walk to do things counterintuitive for a child: survival, extraction, immobilizing the enemy up to and including killing those who are dangerous to her (which consists of pretty much everyone on earth). She has a special nature (that is explained in the film) that allows her to be the very best at all her skills...and she takes to it like coyote-to-carrion.<br /><br />One cannot help but be empathetic toward this woman/child; thus the movie has us on her side throughout the 111 minute run time.<br />Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett give their roles vibrancy. Blanchett's acting both with and against character...spooky role for her and she excels at it.<br /><br />Terrific movie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's great, my grandkids just love it. They are constantly playing it, they don't give me a chance at it.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|really great show, in my opinion the best comedy after Seinfeld. Short episodes, each of them really unique and great. I watched them several times now and still love to watch them when i want to jump-start my mood.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|One of Tom Cruise's Best movies. This writer is fantastic. The action was great, a real good Suspense movie to watch over and over
B0063M22QO|3.0|I thought it would a little more exciting then what it actually was but I will keep it to give me something to do while waiting for appts and such.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's is so awesome I had it for four years and it approve a lot It is amazing get this app
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I bought this one to keep track of the weather that's what it is for right ... I am also a sports fan and I also use it to see what the weather is like in the city they are playing in
0920236162|3.0|It was a great literary work but not the best ending for me. I loved the illustrations and the artwork is fantastic.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|well what can you say about this I have on my laptop so it would only be right to have on the kindle also
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I love all the bad raving reviews on here. This movie is simple. It's primary thrust is philosophical and nonduality is the primary celebrated philosophy, with many other philosophical and psychological points touched on. It's from the same directors as The Matrix but is not action driven. People think an intellectual movie ends with you going \\"Aha! The wife did it! Never saw that coming! And Bruce Willis was a ghost the whole time! Whoa!\\". Now I'm not knocking The Sixth Sense, it's one of my favorites, but movies like that are not \\"intellectual\\", they're just surprising and witty. But witty is not intellectual. This movie is for people who want a beautiful philosophical demonstration.<br /><br />The philosophical viewpoint celebrated in the film is nonduality, which is a central point found among virtually all Eastern religions. (Cloud Atlas is doing much better outside the US than in, btw) The point of the movie is that you are, objectively, ontologically, everyone and everything, and that boundaries are subjective conventions. This is extremely hard for Americans to understand but I'd advise googling it. If you're turned off by me using words like this, you won't like this movie and are not an intellectual person. Even if you don't know what these words mean, but you're intrigued, you're quite possibly intellectually inclined and will probably like this movie.<br /><br />Fans of The Fountain, The Matrix, American Beauty, ehhh.. I dunno.. Movies that you have to think about at least a little.. will like this.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love this one because I love the game growing up and would like to have more friends with kindles play it so I could have someone to play against
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Having watched the series as it originally aired it is just as fun to watch them again now that the Stargate world has come to a close.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|This is an amazingly powerful and beautifully designed app.<br />I was impressed from the start, and not let down as I continue to use it.<br /><br />There seems to be a little misunderstanding about the permissions though. Some reviews seem to think this app can send messages and emails to your contacts without your permission.<br />Not sure what gives them this impression but according to my permissions report this is totally false.<br />My only question is the bookmarks permission. I plan on doing the responsible thing, and contact the developer and ask.<br /><br />I have always found developers to be very responsive to my inquiries.<br />My concerns are usually addressed with a logical and truthful answer.<br />Some reviewers should try this before writing reviews that may be untruthful.<br /><br />I for one am grateful for this FREE app. I see myself getting a lot of use from it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Played all of the available levels, challenged but easy at the same time. My kids also love to play. I look forward to more.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|First purchase on my new Kindle!  What an awesome story.  Kept me from the first page.  Was a little hard to follow at first keeping all the characters straight, but once I got them, I couldn't put the book down!  Highly recommend this book!
B006ZZC3D6|1.0|Didn't like it, didn't feel like instructions were clear enough, so I don't play it  Disappointed as usual in some of the games I purchase
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Visually interesting, although Morgan Freeman's character could have been more developed. The concept was arresting and left me thinking for days afterward.
B008YRVW0I|1.0|I know I never play it so it must not have been what I expected.  I don't play the game at all.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|At the begining, a little confusing to pair with router once paired it's a great addition to the TV.  The only concern that comes to mind is that it overheats, the component tends to run hot and becomes a little sluggish.  Otherwise a great product!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I have Animal Resq on my Iphone and it is a cute game and I was hoping this one would be like it but it is not so I was very disappointed in it.
B007AL48UK|5.0|Very good game - one of my favorites.  Sharp, clear, pictures.  Am looking forward to playing your other games.  Thanks for the game.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Great way to stay connected with family and friends accross the miles.  Watch your privacy settings and be sure they are as you wish.
0894803123|4.0|This was a great buy for my first ice cream maker experience.  Lots of their favorite recipes are included.  Ice cream lovers will not be disappointed.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|== Summary ==<br /><br />This is an excellent novel explaining how things go on IT projects and departments. I depicts a newly promoted VP of IT Operations that will struggle to complete a huge strategic project called Project Phoenix. It is the only and most important that may save the company from its competitors advantages. The IT department has lots os projects to deploy and servers to maintain so they have to juggle between legacy servers and software, new projects and the utmost priority Project Phoenix.<br /><br />The book describes beautifully the process in which Bill Palmer (the new VP of IT Operations) takes over the department with successive failures and lack of control of its operation and, helped by his newfound mentor, transform the business using DevOps, Lean and Constraints Theory concepts.<br /><br />The book is insightful, easy to read (for anyone used to IT terms and words) and very well written.<br /><br />== Pros ==<br /><br />* Very well written novel with a perfect picture of a messed-up IT department<br />* Is based on real cases<br />* It had the help/review of David Allen, Adrian Cockcroft (from Netflix), Paul Muller (from HP), among others<br />* It depicts practical examples of Lean on IT, Theory of Constraints and DevOps<br /><br />== Cons ==<br /><br />* It lacks a sequel deepening all the concepts ;-)<br /><br />== Conclusion ==<br /><br />* If you are an IT manager, read it<br />* If you work closely with IT managers, read it<br />* If you struggle with IT, read it<br />* If you want to change your IT, READ IT NOW!<br />* If you are not used to IT language and terms it might be a difficult reading for you<br />* If you don't like IT this book it not for you
0736092269|5.0|Hands down the best training book I've ever read. Good investment for anyone serious about strength training or fitness in general.
B005T87QCI|3.0|A simple guilty pleasure, though having to buy all the add-ons like building your own robot is a little on the annoying side.
B00ABMZRVO|5.0|This was an edgy look at a hook-up that becomes intense in a very short time. The ending is a surprise because it is not what most viewers would expect. The actors are believable and Lindhardt's character only bends a little in his resolve to leave for the U.S. and this hints that he will change his mind at the end. Very good movie.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|This was a recommended purchase. It was very similar to many other books that discuss human behavior. There were very few original ideas. I could not even finish the book. If you have never taken a course involving human behavior, this may be an interesting read. If you have ever read a single text book or paper revolving around human behavior, this will be a pretty boring read.
B0000WPADK|1.0|Not a good kit for assembly.<br />Pieces don't fit and they fall off, also some pieces need to be glued but the glue is not provided.<br />Definitely don't recommend this my friends.
B005HF0BE8|5.0|Amazing costumes, sets, script and actors. An amazing way of watching a version of History. I Recommend the whole series.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is a pretty good app. I find it simply to use, very good graphics and pretty accurate information and real time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Saying that we enjoy this product is an understatement.  The ease of setup blew us away.  The ease of use makes it our go to streaming device.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can not wait to read the third book!!!<br />This was the most intense hunger games book I have read yet!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is an awesome game. You can play off line whenever and however much you want. Then when you do have an Internet connection you can connect with friends. You can send things to each other and play on their game. Which does not change anything on their game. Just gives you more cash and hearts to play with. Plus its free!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really liked it there where a few errors also liked that your didn't have to pay to get a lot of gems I would recommend it to horse lovers
B000002O4S|5.0|A beloved movie, with a great soundtrack! It was worth the money, and I am happy to add it to my collection!
B009YBU8CQ|5.0|Totally loved this. At some point i felt like i was Kambili. The images were so real in my mind
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The item was exactly what I needed. I had lost my USB cable and this allows me to charge my phone.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|the appstore said this app came with many more features than it really has! do not waste time buying!<br />horrible!!!!
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|Surprisingly good movie and happy to see the &#34;terminator&#34; back in a role that suits him well and playing it with humility but also with the action hero style that catapulted him to the levels we know he reached.<br />Recommended watch.
0316666343|5.0|The book came in on time, was fairly quick, and in perfect condition. I got it for my sister and she absolutely loves it. I've read it before too, and it's a very good read. Definitely recommended to anyone who enjoys this genre.
B00ACKU1NY|4.0|I use it once I while and it has been trouble less so far and quite useful too when I want to know the current international news from the French point of view...recommended
B009AY04A8|4.0|If you enjoy playing hidden object games, you'll enjoy this one. happy. that I. didn't have to pay for it th.<br />ough. pretty simple as of the 8th chapter
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Simply put, download and check it out for yourself, as we all have it on our devices and use it daily. The magazine style app for news is a terrifically refreshing newer style that il personally really enjoy for reading news everyday.<br />Highly recommended
B002O2THRO|4.0|I liked this older version of &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34;<br />It was nice to see it once again and a better version<br />than the current remake
B00992CF6W|5.0|Buy quick it's the best game ever since Mario bros it is good for architects of all ages big or small so,buy today and wait the delay for the is a small price to pay but it is worth it
B0064MGU98|5.0|The story line of the series is very interesting and every time encourages to watch a next episode...acting is very good.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|This app was working great for a while, then it took longer for videos to start, also i purchased the down loader in the app and it doesn't download the videos i select.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|I did not finish this book after becoming very tired of the characters in it.  I mean ALL the characters, including the author.  I know that there have been rave reviews of this book, which is the reason I tried it, but for me I don't need to read a book that shows nothing about what I consider to be interesting people.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|The movie was fast paced Just what you would expect from a Bruce Willis movie. Not for ll age groups.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|I dunno how John le Carre can keep this up.  Each of his stories uses very different styles of writing and presentation, but they all appear to be intelligible and wonderful to read.  This is among the very best of his books.,
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|The movie didn't make sense and became slow in the middle.It had too many twists and turns. I felt like I wasted my time.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|For some reason the DVD did not play in any of my machines. I contacted the seller and he/she was very understanding. My account was credited immediately and I did not have to go to the expense of mailing it back. It was GREAT to have someone take my word and get a NO hassle return. Thanks!!!
B004GGA9MS|5.0|This movie starts out as something else and ends up educating you on how your way of thinking was wrong. A real eye opener.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My husband and my granddaughter love playing this game.  I do not play that often because the graphics are small on the screen, but it works for them.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|A must see for all James Bond fans.Never a dull moment.Action packed all the way through the movie.Another good one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Loaded to Kindle.  Kids enjoy this game.  This also keeps them occupied when I have some work to do around the house.
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|The movie was very good. A little too bloody for me. But a must see for movie goers who like this sort of movie.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Not a bad game at all.  Beat the original arcade game by a long shot.  Be nice to get a few different backgrounds though.
006074748X|5.0|I read Airs Above The Ground a number of years ago and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to read it again.<br />I have not reread it yet but will soon.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|It was an entertaining story with a lot of characters to get to know. There were several errors that drew my attention away from the story. A little proofreading would have been helpful.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|And you could tell.  After reading him for years, I hardly recognized Harry in his first novel.  His writing style wasn't fully developed, but it still reads ok.
0345529057|5.0|Books arrived in a timely manner & everything is ship shape! I am so excited to own this series. I was reading the first book but, for the price I figured I would get the whole series for almost what I paid for the first book alone! Amazing! Thank you.
1936891026|1.0|You could sum up this book saying, \\"Just sit down and get to work, and fight procrastination. Once you get started, it's uphill from there.\\" Instead, there is much repetition and nonsense about fighting the \\"resistance\\" and \\"angels\\" and \\"god.\\" I got this as a gift from my fiance. We both read it and were both very disappointed with the content and fluff in the book. I want to learn how to master art and success in art, not be preached to and thrown new age crap and religious doctrine.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|This was a fun fast pased book that did not require too much thinking.  It was exactly what I needed at the time I read it.  I would consider reading other books by this author as time and circumstance fit.  Primarly, this book is aimed at young adults who like whimsy and enjoyed fairy tales once upon a time.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|The author uses a number of statistical figures, but not the seats sold, total income and profits, which should support the theory of &#34;I am doing the right thing&#34; One can only suppose the financial figures improve, since the GM is now a part owner but, from my personal point of view, it is the bottom line that counts
B008602KQI|2.0|I have heard good things about this movie, but it just throws you into it without any reason why the Hunger Games is taking people. I love movies and worked in a video store for 5 years, this was way too slow to keep me interested. I understand the book is superior so I will read that and attempt to watch this again.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I like the game. I have completed Level 10, and hoping after this review I will be able to continue.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Good book. Connelly is really good and keeps you turning pages faster than you think.  And Harry Bosch is the best (as always).
0786958731|4.0|Its very different. Kind of confusing but tonite was our first night of playing it. 2 people.<br />Were still not sure we completely understand it. A lot still doesnt make sense to us.. My hubby is a huge D&D and R.A Salvatore fan. He loves Drizzt. Great gift, confusing, but were still learning.<br />LOTS of pieces, HOLY!<br />Need A LOT of space to play. We ended up taking some of the board apart but you really cant do that.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Addictive and frustrating, but love it.  Very entertaining.  Think you're asking for too many words when you want the  review.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Plz in the next update to put in rain animations and wendy animations with leaves in the screen and lightning bolts in your screen and I want herobrin to be in the game. I will give you a five star wen it is in in the game
1476712042|5.0|Great book from beginning to end! Need a good book to read pick this! Can't wait to read more by this author
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great character development, good plot, really enjoyed this read.  Very engrossing,  Not as predictable as most books.  Pretty quick read.

B005LAIH2M|5.0|was a very good movie lots of action ..very good acting cannot wait for a part two..the troll was way kool
B001AQQR2S|4.0|Its a great movie to watch with your family and I love that Amazon Prime has it. My only problem with it (which could be my internet I'm not sure), but half way through the movie it would randomly go blurry for a few minutes then clear up then go blurry again. Other than that, it was great!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I thought it would be short because there are only 10 songs on this CD, but they are each 8-10 minutes long! The songs have great beats and lyrics (rare exception for this album is Strawberry bubble gum - the lyrics are for a pre-teen pop band and the music sounds like it was all done on a cheap keyboard.)
B007PP2J9I|4.0|This was a fun follow-up to the author's first book, &#34;Zero Day&#34;. While I enjoyed reading it, I did feel a little like I've been there and done that. Still, I really enjoyed the book and felt like it was a faithful follow-up to the first book. I had hoped to gain a bit more insight to the main characters, although I did find myself laughing out loud at some o the humor in the book. Also, once the action gets moving, it is full steam ahead until the conclusion of the book.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Zero Day Your sure to like Trojan Horse as well.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|this movie is awesome :) I am so glad I had pre ordered it and was able to see in the comfort of my home
B00139XTG4|3.0|Although Mr. Taleb's idea is vital to understanding of failed attempts to theoretize and predict, I don't think this book is something unuasually great and even worth to read (for me to read again). The same effect can be obtained easily by any enough critically thinking person. It would be better to put the same info in shorter article to save reader's time. The only idea of the book is really simple and straightforward, 90% of time is dedicated to supply it with why and how in very abstract and I would say phylosophical way. And at the same time with almost no or vague structure of presented materials. I recommend other books on similar themes of thinking and perception like &#34;Thinking: Fast and Slow&#34;, which are much better structured and has more than one (almost) trivial idea.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|It's the Goonies!!  Classic.  I shouldn't have to say anything else but they require at least 20 words.  The only way this is better is when it's a midnight screening at our historic downtown theater.  Goonies on the BIG screen! :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is the best game I ever had you should get it to because it is the best game I ever had if you don't you are missing at on the fun
B00068C7WA|5.0|The Piano Man is one of my all time favorite songs. Heard it on the radio the other day and decided to order the CD - my last version was an vinal - wore it out.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The way this works, my laptop doesn't need a cable. I don't even need to be paying attention to what's being broadcast. I can sit back and let it do its own thing. My laptop or phone can function autonomously, and that is by far this product's best success. Near realtime interactions are nice as well. I can control volume from any device rather than fumbling around for a remote. It does need more applications, but that's an ephemeral state since new apps are being developed for it and the device itself requires no change.<br /><br />Nicely done Google. Oh and the 3 months of free Netflix is a pretty sweet deal too.<br /><br />The only difficulty I had was accessing it (and protecting it) on a college campus. Since you need to be connected to the same wifi signal, a sort of tricky workaround I devised was to use my laptop to broadcast a weak wifi signal to the chromecast, and connect to it as well with my phone. The protected, private network allowed me to ensure neighbors couldn't mess with the display, and limit which of my friends could screw around with it as well. If you're on a college campus, set your chromecast up like that. There are free programs out there which enable almost any laptop to broadcast a wifi signal, get one and hook it up!<br /><br />Goodbye Apple TV, goodbye Roku, goodbye HDMI cables. Chromecast is now king.
B000002GW5|5.0|My old roommate and I wore out 3 vinals when this came out in the '70s had to have another one for &#34;on the road&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|pretty good game it is confusing. at first but after a while it gets pretty easy.I gust got the game but you need wifi to play
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Not as great as the previews. A little slow in spots but it was decent overall. Not something I would add to my collection.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|this was ordered a number of years ago.  if I recall we had absolutely no problems at all. thanks for the memories
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is known to be a great processor but I was very surprised by how great it is. The other reviews pretty much sum it up. Highly recommend!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this app but it needs more vehicles and maps but it is a really good time killer .
B007R21JJK|1.0|This board is great in nearly all ways. I would rate it a 5 star but the build quality is pathetic. Thank goodness for Amazon's exchange policy, because Gigabyte's customer support is atrocious. If you are like me and the board comes broken or defective I strongly suggest just sending it to Amazon and leaving Gigabyte and their surly customer service folks out of the loop.<br /><br />UPDATE: This ended up being worse than I thought. I actually own two of these boards and the second had a similar issue with the same PCIe3 slot which forced me to return to Amazon. This is the lowest quality construction of any PC component I have used, ever, and I am including the cheapest junk I have encountered in this comparison. Gigabyte is apparently complete garbage which I will now avoid. Again, their customer service is offensively dismissive and surly. Boo, Gigabyte, boo!<br /><br />UPDATE2: Third time the PCI express slot has broken off the board, there seems to be nothing holding the plastic to the board other than the pins in the PCI slots. Gigabyte still is useless as far as support. I will not be purchasing any Gigabyte products in the future.<br /><br />Avoid Gigabyte products.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Setup was a breeze. This little device works perfectly and at 35 bucks is a steal. Going to order another one back in stock.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The characters were well written and likable, the setting was described perfectly, descriptive but not too long. Plot was interesting and moderately paced. Mood was set great, depressing and hopeful and courageous at times. You can really sympathize with the characters. Ends on a slight cliffhanger, but not one that will make you pull you're hair out. Only thing that annoyed me was how in the beginning the main character and reader didn't know what was going on. I know that was to give the feel of frustration and confusion, but it got a little too much.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The interplay between the members of the Avengers team is hilarious. Yes, there are some cheesy parts, but for the most part it isn't over the top cheesy. Performances by all actors involved is great. Looks like they were also having a lot of fun when they were making the movie.<br /><br />One of the few movies I wouldn't mind seeing multiple times!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|It's Denzel, what more can I say!  This movie is not as action filled as I thought but Denzel like always is a great actor and makes the movie a winner.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I'll look in my downloads area of my Kindle. So if I can't find it then obviously I can't rate it. LOL
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I liked how it was in different point of views.<br /><br />Omg, and Taylor lautner is so hot!!<br /><br />Just saying lol
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|He plays it all the time. So from my observation he loves Jetpack Joyride.<br />Life is good. He's happy so I'm happy.
B002ZG999U|4.0|At first glance, The Expendables appears to be little more than an impressive collection of action stars. Look deeper, though, and you'll find a surprisingly human story underneath. These men, while physically dominating, are also quite fragile. They are misfits, too scarred by the things they've witnessed to function in normal society. Therefore, they must rely on each other to survive. This is especially apparent in Dolph Lundgren's character, Gunner, a man psychologically fractured by his past and always a hair's breath away from a violent end. Mickey Rourke's character is another prime example; he frequently laments the choices he's made, while relying on the group's bond to keep himself from going to pieces.<br /><br />And yes, there's also quite a bit of gunplay, fisticuffs and gore. Some of the blood looks a little too CG for me, but that's OK. The action had me riveted throughout, and at the end of the day you get a good story about the friendships we sometimes take for granted.
B00CJGP116|5.0|Marc Anthony, when singing salsa and other Latin music, really brings out his talent. My Spanish is limited, but even if I'm not understanding all the words right now, I feel the music inside.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great book for anyone who has experienced foster care from any angle!  I liked the fairly realistic plot and engaging subject matter.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I grew up watching the old Star Trek television show, seen the new spin offs, some just don't compare. However, that being said, this remake of the television series was fantastic.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't even know what to say. I really am so upset this book is actually over. I got so drawn into this book and it made me look at things in a completely different way. Thank you John Green for writing this amazing, inspiring book. Unbelievable how emotional I got throughout this book. It would be a shame not to read this book!
B008MEM24S|5.0|My grandson loves Perry, it is easy for him to play, yet still challenges him to think for solutions. I recommend it for kids of all ages.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|For a show that is different, intelligent and bizarre and fun all at the same time, can't stop watching it!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I usually shy away from the more violent shows, but this one has a compelling cast. Katey Sagal is brilliant and, even though Sons is supposedly loosely interpreted from Hamlet, I say she makes one heck of a great Lady Macbeth.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|This album is awesome. The quality and sound are fantastic and like all the other CDs i have purchased i have no complaints at all. I have been buying CDs from Amazon for over six years now and only ever had one problem which was rectified IMMEDIATELY and to my COMPLETE SATISFACTION.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Awesome game<br />Cute game<br />Fun game<br /> Fun and awesome and educational. NEMO IS so cute and funny<br />As usual dory is still really dumb
B009AY04A8|3.0|I am glad that I found this game.I am also glad that you could skip the dialogue.I enjoy reading some lines but this one was a little too much. The game of finding itself was good. For the cost if you had to pay for it might be a little much as I have seen better graphics but it still was fun and I kept playing till the end
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is a wonderful recreation of Missile command and I enjoy it I think it's worth 99¢ it is always challenging.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this game for my niece and we both ended up having a blast with it. Definitely one of the best games you can get for your tablet.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The story was well-told, however, the ending left me disappointed. Grisham usually has a twist or turn at the end, and this one failed to deliver.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|It had a disturbing and unexpected ending.  This movie makes one think about what or who we put our trust in.
B0011UGLK6|4.0|Jhumpa Lahiri writes beautifully but I was unable to forgive a similar theme as her last two books this time around -- Non-resident Bengalis trying to adjust to American life and mostly failing miserably. Till I reached the last short story, Hema and Kaushik. That just blew my mind. I am still reeling from the beauty and depth of that story.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The reviews I read for this book weren't good but I found the book on a blog that I get reviews from and she said it was one of her favorites.  I ususually agree with the author of the blog so I gave it a shot.  My opinion on everyone elses negative thoughts on the book is that I think the book is real and people are still hiding in a fantasy world.  The fighting is no more graphic than you turning on the tv and seeing some of the shows they put on tv.  The sex, its real.  Now days that is just about how it is in college and out of college.  No one waits til they fall in love anymore, one night stands are the norm.  So I thought nothing of the violence or sex.  I was more into the story of 2 people and how they get together and break up.<br /><br />This book is all I can think about.  I read it in a day, I couldn't put it down.  I really related with the characters going through break up and how bad your heart just hurts.  The instant I was done with this book I downloaded the second book, I couldn't get enough.  I will probably read them both again in the near future.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I like the amp but i gotta use 20 words, but I'd rather use the amp. So, now I got an amp and a sore thumb.
B00CE3IC74|3.0|These tags are great for programming general functions (wifi, Bluetooth, etc) but the size is too small for programming contract information. Please make NTAG203 with 1kb storage, or a tag compatible with the GS4 with larger storage.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|Fabulous! Great product pricing and fast delivery. Excited to find at affordable price too, stores do not sell in our area. We will be back for more, hours of fun!!!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Level 60 on Thursday (8/23).  Then it updated without asking me.  Since then I have not been able to get on.  Same problem as others \\"String not found\\", gets to 50% load and then crashes.  Why aren't these updates tested before distribution.  I develop database applications for a living and would never publish anything that didn't work on all platforms and would never update without asking permission first.
B00B05Z77U|5.0|This book is an excellent examination of the world from the viewpoint of the 30% to 50% of us who lean more towards introversion than extroversion. Introverts will see themselves reflected throughout every chapter. Extroverts will gain insights into human relations that they often overlook in our &#34;extrovert ideal&#34; culture.<br /><br />The strategies and examples to help introverts effectively operate in the US culture were great and I now put them to use daily.
B009AY04A8|4.0|lacks music. simple fun HO game. even with the lack of music I look forward to the second pirates adventure
B00632HWOG|5.0|This has come in handy as can now check my email on my Kindle Fire when I am away from home.  It helps keep me current and keeps the amount of emails down as I can get to them anytime I want.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Oh my gosh!  If you are a fan of Downton Abbey and havent' seen all the epsidoes then this is a must!<br />I was given the first season to watch and was hooked!  I wanted to see more so I thought to clik on to Amazon and learned because I am an Amazon Prime member I could catch up on season 2 for free.  I did end up purchasing the last season just because I didn't want to wait.....I streamed it through my kids old Wii.  Can't wait until season 4!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait for the next. Such dynamic and psychologically accurate character development. You're always left wanting more with Martin's writing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works as advertised - hardly any setup, great picture quality.  Can't wait to see all the functionality still to come.  Thanks again, Google.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|the kind of movie where you turn off your brain and relax. Fun and relaxing, also great to see all these action guys together
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Great movie I really liked it...I would recommend for everyone. Truly a great movie. Wow wow watch please its great
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|The product is good, very good.  I thought the dvd skipped from Copyright warning straight to menu (darn ha!), but now I think it's my machine.  So no problems.  And it was delivered the day promised, UPS worked until late to complete their orders.  Thank you thank you.
B00EKJWS1Q|5.0|Wow this app is great..I've love how it allows me to  me to open likenks within it. Not sure if that made since but it's amazing. If you live off your email you will like this  app
B001HN697M|5.0|I had not expected this movie to be that great after the second installment, but it was pleasantly surprising. It had a good plot, good effects, and solid acting. While it couldn't be considered a blockbuster, it was highly entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is really fun and I truly enjoyed it. You like fun then you will like this  app really
B007THA4FI|1.0|I have very much enjoyed this book, but reading it on my kindle has been a nightmare--I have to have my font setting on the largest setting available, and even then, the font is tiny and difficult to read (I'm 29, by the way, and do not have vision problems).  I tried deleting it off my kindle and re-downloading it several times, but that didn't work, leading me to believe the font size problem is related to the e-copy itself. I would recommend going with the print edition of this.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|This is a (very) goofy app that doesn't work quite right on the kindle fire, because of this fact; there aren't any microphones on the kindle fire, so you can't talk to Ben. But everything else works perfectly fine! Plenty of fun. Especially those potions... and I think if you got head phones with a mic you would be able to talk to Ben too!
B009AY04A8|3.0|It's a pretty good game the problem I have with it is that when you try to zoom in it counts as a tap and when you do it too often it takes time off of the clock.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|The movie has been watched numerous times and still freaks us out!! Not good to watch on a stormy night.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy this game greatly I love being able to care for a horse!!!!!!!:)<br />It is super easy and its not that hard to earn coins or gems. This game is so much fun.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|really fun. controls react quickly and reminds me of ipod game during the nano series. worth th doller bill. fun
006114665X|5.0|Up to date description of the July Crisis of 1914. Avoids the blame game and shows that the Kaiser was not the monster he is often portrayed as. The French and the Russians do not get off so easily, however. Will change your understanding of the origins of the war.
B00C6Q6OAG|4.0|A birthday gift for my Granddaughter!<br /><br />She loved it!<br /><br />will recomend this to others!<br /><br />Shipping was a small issue!<br /><br />The other gift was not so good!  looked like it had been opened already!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This book was a great read.  Can't wait to start the next one.  The writing was a especially good.  Enjoy\
B009AY04A8|4.0|its a pretty short game. I finished it in one day. over all it was good. just wish it was longer!
0765325950|5.0|Awesome, what need I say more. Sometimes very hard to put down with so many different story-lines going on at once.
140006922X|5.0|Finally a more fact based look at how our religions developed.  A must read for anyone who wants a more realistic view of the evolution of both Christianity and Judaism.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I got this at a great price, and it came very quickly and in great quality. It works perfectly and looks as good as new, even though it was used. Love it!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|thought the plot was slow to develop and did not care for the ending.  Also under utilized some great actors
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|You can never go wrong with any of Josh's albums.  His voice is so mature and sensual.  Highly recommended to anyone that loves music.
B001QWBM62|4.0|I have only had the recorder for a short while, so still trying to figure out all the bells and whistles.  I have worked with a friend for uses this recorder and it seems to be the best in class.  My only complaint is that is shipped with a defective memory card.  I installed the card and the recorder said I had no card in the device.  So I tried formatting it, but again it would not recognize it.  I then tried the card in my PC and it could not recognize it either.  So finally I tried another memory card I had at home and suddenly everything worked.  So perhaps a minor thing, but irritating because at first I thought I had a defective unit.
B003IY48PS|4.0|The Evil Dead reinvented horror in the early 1980s to great success. Friends stay at a cabin where the dead come to life. Bruce Campbell is good here but even better in the sequel which veers off towards comedy but remains an absolute classic as well.<br /><br />Audio Formats: English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround Sound, French Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, Spanish<br />Special Features: Featurettes, Alternate & Deleted Scenes, Still Gallery, Trailers<br /><br />Buy this film. I'm shocked that there is no box set of the Evil Dead franchise in the US. A 3-disc Evil Dead Trilogy box set on Blu-ray is available in Region 2 with some new extras for Evil Dead 2. It also includes vintage extras (including the Bruce Campbell hosted documentary which was previously only avaliable on the \\"Evil Dead: Book of the Dead\\" release). Hopefully we get a deluxe stateside release. The advantage of The Evil Dead is the tight canon (quadrilogy) but you can skip the forgettable Evil Dead remake (Part 4 in the franchise) with none of the same cast.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|This book will confirm everything (bad) you ever thought about pharmaceuitical companies. An aspirin will never be the same again...
B000T12J8Q|5.0|I saw this movie when I was a teenager and fogot all the details! Anthony Quinn's performance is amazing! The story is exciting. Great choice
0812417755|5.0|Billy Pilgrim is quite detached from reality. Not just because he acts like a lunatic, he also suffers from the ability of seeing reality as it really is. Time is just an illusion. That's what he learned after he was abducted by aliens to the planet of Tralfamadoria. Reality isn't that important to Billy because he can to jump to different points of time in his life. One period of his existence seems to become the hub of his travels: the attack on Dresden, Germany at the end of World War II.<br /><br />While I was expecting an anti-war novel when I opened this novel, I was completely taken by the sci-fi part of the story. Or isn't it? It's never really clear if the time travel is symbolic or implied reality. Being very much fascinated by the theoretical implications of manipulating the fourth dimension, I myself decided to go ahead with the travels being real. And Kurt Vonnegut certainly doesn't disappoint on that level, indeed. He got his facts straight. At this level Slaughterhous-Five is a thought-provoking sci-fi novel that can be ranked with the best.<br /><br />But this book is so much more. The time travel can be seen as a narrative tool to contrast many of the emotions our main character goes through. Although Billy is emotionally completely detached from everything that happens around him -yes, he knows when he is going to die- the reader gets to fill in the blanks easily. This is really very powerful and also helps keep the pace in the story. But most of all it brings the involvement to a intense level of rawness.<br /><br />The anti-war part of the book might be a little bit dated. At the time of its first release it was not done to focus a story on the not so heroic aspects of war. No hero can be found in Slaughterhouse-Five and that fact might, at the time, have been really ground-breaking. Nowadays it's less common to read about the glamour of war and this only adds to the praise of authors like Kurt Vonnegut.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I wanted to &#34;cast screens&#34; to my TV, and it does that very well. The YouTube and Netflix play is a bonus, though I already could do that with my &#34;smart&#34; TV. I'm happy.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I couldn't find this anywhere else and it is not found on electronic media. There are 3 or 4 songs that kill it---I use them to set personal records in weightlifting. Others find more of a cultish Pink Floyd kind of sound along with some primal emphasis. I like them but it isn't something I'd listen to every day. Several songs make it worth 5 stars.
B00006FDCD|4.0|Great Stephen King Novel Gets Great Casting! Stephen King's It is one of the best horror novels of all time. The film adaptation features great casting of people you will recognize instantly. \\"It\\" is a clown named Pennywise. He haunts some teens (they were ten-years-old in the novel) because he says \\"I'm your worst nightmare and everything you've ever been afraid of.\\" For some reason we do not get the original broadcast of \\"It\\". Instead of an extra disc a double-sided disc is used. Fortunately the film still looks and sounds good with a great audio commentary (Dennis Christopher, Tim Reid, John Ritter, Richard Thomas, and Director Tommy Lee Wallace). Naturally the film is not as good as the book by Stephen King but it's actually quite entertaining. Since it was a 1990 two-part TV mini-series it never got much respect but it is fairly faithful to the novel. Tommy Lee Wallace assembles an amazing cast. Tim Reid was incredible. They all make the movie work and I have enjoyed watching it many times. There are at least 5 cuts of the film with different running times. The longest is 192-minutes and the shortest is 168-minutes. I would love to see an uncut \\"It\\" on Blu-ray with an extra disc with a 2-hour documentary about the film, deleted scenes and bonus supplements.<br /><br />Buy this film. It is a cult hit despite mainstream audiences preferring studios cut the running time on this mini-series.
B00AFPTSI0|3.0|My book club chose this and in the end only two of us finished it. My observation was that the book drags at points. The general concepts I found engaging and insightful. I just think it could have used a better editor to assist the author in making his points.
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|In comparison to previous albums the songs are a little dark for my liking.  They always produce great music.  Maybe next time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can stream content from any HDTV - and for only $35. Easy install, simple setup. What's not to like?
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Amazon Rocks!!! Being able to watch this ovie before the DVD rlease was great. I love Star Trek and have since I was 2. Live Long and Prosper Star Trek
0307913090|5.0|Delightful story.  I have ordered the next book.  The additional storyline and details such as the character's thoughts add depth to my enjoyment of the TV depiction.
B009AY04A8|4.0|As other reviewers have said, lots of dialogue but cute storyline. Smooth playing games that weren't to had but challenging. Got this on the free app of the day and couldn't stop playing it until I finished the game. Will probably get more of their games.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|Why exactly does a notebook app need to look at my web history? Maybe the developer has a legit reason, but I can't see any logical reason. I didn't finish installing so I can't review how useful the app may or may not be.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Good choice.  Very well acted and the cast was wonderful. I would recommend this movie to many others. Maggie Smith was great.
0061122416|3.0|but I thought this was going to be much more insightful based on friend's recommendations.  Perhaps it's just not the right time for me to read it - or whatever...
B006S01GH2|5.0|I have loved and laughed at this gem of a movie for years.  I won't go into the story as it would ruin it for anyone who has not seen it.  The subtitles do not hurt it at all.  If you have never seen this or have a time or two, watch it again. You won't be sorry. Super acting, brilliant story,and a feel good end.
B00CAGCVZE|1.0|not only doesn't it work, the company refused to give me my money back, saying they would fix it, not cool on their part
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|If you liked the other series (the Lord of The Rings series) you will like this too.  I think maybe I should have seen it in the theater because I think it really would have been great there.  But I did like the story and the use of color to influence mood.  I will see the next one when it comes out, so I guess that means this one of good enough.
0802473156|4.0|Truly gets to the heart of the matter.  Provides excellent content regarding the differences between men and women and how to understand and appreciate the needs of each other.  Provides great insight into communication and the benefits of knowing how to communicate and communicate your love in a manner that can be accepted and appreciated.
B00AA0TZTW|1.0|This CD is lousy in plain english. The music is leftovers that I doubt Hendrix would never have released. The most likely reason for its release is so the estate/family could make money. I listened to it twice and have to say it is awful. One or two songs decent but you can tell these were trials and the songs we enjoyed, some based on the ones here, were the right ones to release years ago. If you are a collector this may interest you but do not expect a good musical selection, this is the bottom of the barrel as far as I am concerned.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|The game is sort of cute, but not cute enough to pay for constant up grades. When you figure in the upgrades it's a pretty expensive app.
0452289963|5.0|What an inspirational book! I feel so inspired after reading this book, only confirms what I've always believed! Loved it!
B008AIGWVA|4.0|This app is so much fun. Talking Ben answers u, and mocks what u say. He even does lab testing. I reccomend this app for u or it would be great for children
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I would love to love this device but it does not play audio through my TV.  After looking at forums is claims to not support HDMI 1.2, only 1.4.  This needs to be fixed so I can cease spreading a bad word for this device that I had such high hopes for.  Also, the Netflix/Youtube streaming needs to go to 1080p to my TV, the resolution is reduced.  I figure that is a mere software tweak after the initial adopters put the device through the paces.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|End of world concept different than anything before it.  I did enjoy the book, however it feels very dark & depressing.  Writing was very good until the end where H H got to that point where he said to himself &#34; It is time to end this book&#34;.  And he did, very poorly I might add.  I did enjoy the book even though it was depressing to me to read it.  Other people probably will not have this problem.  And, I would recommend this book as I did give it 4 stars.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|its fun to play . I love the colors. nemos anemone is brightly lit and it draws your attention. I like this game. I'm a daily player
B008JFUUIA|5.0|And you don't like it, then you're obviously a robot or something that's incapable of feeling human emotions. At first I wasn't really interested in seeing it, despite my slightly creepy love for Anna Kendrick (she's my pretend best friend who doesn't know I'm alive).  But I finally Netflixed it and before I had even finished the movie, I was ordering a copy for myself from Amazon.  I'm pretty sure I watched it 6 times the first week I owned it.  It never gets old.  The Riff-Off is maybe the best thing that's ever happened to me.  It's up there with the end of Dirty Dancing on my list of &#34;Best Musical Moments in Cinema.&#34;
B0063IH60K|4.0|Even the winning hand deal is challenging. I don't ALWAYS win on that deal! BUT it's a game and I do like it quite a bit! it's great to just kill some time.  And sometimes you just do need to kill some time! Fun Fun Fun! I got the free version so it may not be the best game ever but again, it's a free time killer.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great little app.  It is an easy to use calculator especially for people with limited dexterity. The large format makes it ideal for people with visual problems.  It is accurate and extremely simple to use.
030746363X|1.0|If you are looking for a quick fix diet.  -  this is not it.  This book was so involved and so hard to get through, I sent it back. It needed a chapter on &#34;follow this every day and you'll get this result&#34; .
0486284735|5.0|Jane Austen's novels are always beautiful, as is this one. Such wit and sense all together in one book. You will love Elizabeth and Mr.Darcy.
0486266885|4.0|Whether or not you've read this book, you certainly know the basics of the story. Set in London, it begins with a Mr. Enyart, cousin of Mr. Utterson, attorney-at-law, recounting an incident in which a man tramples a child and is forced to pay restitution to the family. This intrigues Utterson, who Dr. Jekyll tasks with preparing documents that award Mr. Hyde his assets in the event of his death or disappearance. Utterson dreams about the trampling and begins to \\"haunt the door\\" of Mr. Hyde because he thinks he might do something drastic should he learn the contents of Dr. Jekyll's will. Jekyll finally tells Utterson that he's sticking his nose where it doesn't belong and gets him to reluctantly agree to help Hyde in the event of his own disappearance. A year later, a maid sees Hyde use a can to murder a man. Trying to track him down, Utterson and an inspector learn that Hyde's maid has not seen him in a couple of months. Jekyll shows a letter to Utterson indicating that Hyde is alive and well. Utterson's clerk points out the similarities between Jekyll's and Hyde's handwriting, after which the mystery quickly unravels. I'll leave it to you to read the book (really, a novella as it's so short) to learn the details. The story is short (only about 100 pages), must-read classic. Also good: Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, Five Little Peppers and How They Grew by Margaret Sidney and Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I wanted to like this better. The back was really funny. And there were a few good lines that really stuck with me. I don't watch her TV show or anything, so maybe it reads exactly like she is on her show. To me, it was more like her character from Finding Nemo. Rambling and off-topic and all over the place. Maybe it's better as an audiobook, who knows. Anyway. It was pretty meh for me.
B003S6T62Q|5.0|Joe is a musical genius! His live performance will leave you wanting more. I love how he came back for an encore and the band members came out one by one and connected so well with each other, the band was in sync for Joe's tone, style and direction. I will forever love him and he will always be my favorite R&B artist of all time! I will meet him someday and it will be a lovely moment for me and him, just you wait and see!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I really love their sense of humor!  Can't wait for the 9th season to start!  I like the way it ended. I really enjoyed this season!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This books is a great books for kids to read. It can show how to have compassion for others that are different than the 'norm.' Providing different points of view kept the story interesting.
B00A7ZHDOO|4.0|OK so it's a Sparks movie with all that that implies....but excellent quality Blu-ray.  Frequently visiting Southport and Oak Island, NC, makes it special for us.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I really loved this book.  It tells the story of 2 women (Miriam and Leila) in Afghanistan, who will be brought together by fate.  This book also tells the history and all recent wars Afghanistan had to endure.  As a family who had more than one family member deployed to Afghanistan, I really liked reading the historic facts of this book  Also it gives the reader a great inside of how women in the larger cities used to live and how their fate were shaped by the Taliban.  Afghan women in the larger city used to have more freedoms as they have now.  People used to be able to watch TV or movies or listen to music.  The book also tells about how other historic treasures were destroyed under Taliban rule.  Although the book has almost a happy ending the 2 women have to sacrifices almost everything.  The sad thing is that the story is so plausible that it really could have happen this way.  I loved reading this book and I can only highly recommend it.  During all the wars in Afghanistan many innocent lives were lost.  Not just in the recent war but also in the other wars before that.  I hope that people like Leila and her family will one day be allowed to lead their lives in Afghanistan again.
B00E5N8E6K|5.0|I saw them in concert for Viva Hysteria! three times. I can't wait to re-live the memories! I also can't wait to see Ded Flatbird again.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy the horror genre, even though there are sooooooo many bad ones out there. I'm forever in search of a movie that will scare the crap out of me... THIS ONE SCARED THE $#*% OUT OF ME! The acting is superb and the suspense along with the overall creepiness actually gave me shivers. I giggle at most horror movies, but no giggles this time.<br />Chapter 2 comes out in a couple of weeks and for once I'm actually excited for a sequel...
B003O86FMW|4.0|Hunger Games was great. just reading first 50 pages of Catching Fire yet. Reading novel is better than watch movie.
086571701X|4.0|I don't have an acquaponics setup yet, but when I can afford to build one, I'll be relying on advice from this book.
B00D8RYV52|5.0|My kids LOVE Dr. Panda and get excited when there's a new app to play. Dr. Canada's Garage is their favorite so far. They love choosing the different car designs and pumping gas. This app truly speaks to their imaginations (mine as well!).
B007AL48UK|5.0|Nice to be able to change with the seasons or as the mood strikes.  Different and challenging.  Like the different tiles. Kids will like it too. Nice way to relax after a long day at work or after being stuck in traffic.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Not Iphone or Ipad compatable yet.  Supposed to have an app coming, but not yet.  Hope it will be working soon.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Omg!!! I can't wait to read the next book!!! This has been a great series so far!! My, my, my.....
B005MP28B2|5.0|I've read a number of reviews of this movie and heard all sorts of opinions ranging from brilliance to utter boredom. It is true that it is not very linear but there is a key to appreciating this work of art (and it is a work of art). Experience it. Observe. There is a grand scope to this film from the creation of the universe to the creation of life. The whole film feels like you're lying in water with your ears below the surface, eyes closed, remembering the past, and imagining origins you've never personally seen. You need to float through this movie and allow your conscious to see through the character's eyes. It is a roving perspective where the film tries to see through each character internally. Empathetic souls will appreciate this movie exponentially more than other personality types. Rich with nostalgia and soul searching, it is not a typical movie with a typical plot but it is absolutely worth checking out!
1401324029|2.0|Too much expectation...didn't produce like I thought it would.<br />Not bad...just not as good as the TV series.<br />I will stick with my Spenser books...
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|My niece became very fustrated with it, she did not enjoy it at all! No sure if this was rated for age or not, but thought it woud be fun for her.. Guess not.
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|I love the quality of the music,  and singer that is Marc Anthony!! If you love latin music this is a good election to buy
B000SEFNMS|5.0|I would never have even considered reading this book if it hadn't been assigned to my 17 year old son for summer reading before his senior year of high school. I had been, like many, supremely annoyed by people who go off into the wild then need to be rescued. But now I feel completely different about it. Beautiful book. Exceedingly well written.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I loved this although it is definetely not for young children - I had to hide my eyes many times !!! I am sure I will watch it again some day as it will be easier to follow and understand the next time.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|John Mayer has always been a great talent and while some will criticize his personal life or even laid back style, it's only preference and that is usually quite arbitrary. This album is very listenable and while it is not breaching new ground in composition, it is a solid body of work with some great collaborations!
1401323820|2.0|It was...okay.  Unfortunately, being a big fan of Castle, I kept putting Nikki Heat in the place of Kate Beckett as well as Jameson Rook in the place of Rick Castle.  That just got confusing as hell.  Not a bad book but nowhere near the caliber of the TV series<br />If I could separate the characters better or if I had never watched Castle, it would probably have been a more enjoyable read.
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|There is something about this movie that keeps me coming back. Good story, good message, overall lovely movie. Can't watch it enough.
B00821OX98|5.0|Entertaining, tense, sweet, funny, with aliens. What more do you want? The cast are invested in their characters, they have real life issues and they deal with them in realistic ways (of course I'm using realism loosely considering the whole post-apocalyptic aliens things.)
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|My husband and I enjoy this series. Interesting and clean. Hard to find a good decent show to watch together, but we really enjoy this one.
037582913X|5.0|My son loved this book when he was 3 years old, I still have it for my grandchildren. I was replacing the worn out copy!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|As the title of my review says this game is simple and fun. Anyone who plays this game will be glued to their tablet for hours.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is fun and interactive and works really well. I've only had a couple force closes, but nothing worth fretting about.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I have played this 3 D puzzle countless times and I never get tired of it. It's really cool and I would recommend it.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Some are easy and some are hard !! Fun game to play ...love the way you have to think in and out of the box..game update with more level
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|As with all of khaled's books, his language is so rich you feel you are seeing, feeling, sometimes even smelling the Story being told. Loved it from start to finish, thank you.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|After I purchased this book on my I-pad I checked my records and found I had read it in 2008....but am reading it again and find it even more entertaining the second time around...especially since there is now a series on TV called &#34;King and Maxwell&#34;  I am 1/2 through the book and do not remember any of the twists yet to come.  Really well written as are all of David Balducci's books that I have read, so far!
1892005034|5.0|It is very easy to read and understand. It reads like the author is talking to you and he has very good advice concerning relationships. You have to do the work, reading the book does is not magic. Some of what he says requires a lot of courage and desire and willingness to change.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome gadget! It exceeded my expectations. Very, very easy to configure and to operate. The program for my Android was not available in my country and I have to download the apk apps from outside the Play Store. It shouldn't be restricted for any country.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|The more function an app has, the more  essential it is to have documentation.  Where is it?  The developer seems to have only marginal skill in the English language.  Fine, then ask for help!  If you can make a nice video demo of one template, you can write a proper manual.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|still considered one of the great movies that he directed and starred in.....all his movies showed the dedication to the martial arts and he definitlely  was ahead of his time....this movie is still rated as his best, and will be for sometime...worth the price...
B008Y76VW2|4.0|This is a good movie.  Holds your interest all through the movie.  You could watch this many times and not get bored with it.
B0048LPRD2|3.0|One of my favorites cinematic experiences, that's why I bought it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the case was cracked upon arrival.  This was certainly disappointing but not heartbreaking. Unarguably, it is not worth my time nor the raw materials and energy to replace it.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Not as intense as the original, but still big fun. What I wouldn't give for a Trac ball right now.<br /><br />Update<br /><br />After reading reviews regarding malware, immediately uninstalled. Too bad. Was actually fun the first time I played.
B005D4YOFK|5.0|These are some of the best sandals we've tried. They are well supported and comfortable right from the start. So many shoes do not have the support like Keens. We recommend them for almost any activity.
B00A8M7H42|5.0|Man! Is this another great item from kotobukiya or what? I love all their pieces and this batman is no exception. The metallic finish and the details are superb. I highly recommend this statue to any collector that´s either a fan of the kotobukiya line or just a batman´s fan. It wont dissapoint.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Good read.  It explained the different strategies used by the prosecuter and defense lawyers in a case. Well written, as usual by this author.
B001O5LVPI|1.0|Lilo and Stitch are just about the dumbest names I have ever heard, and the film represents those stupid names! I personally hate this movie, it's just so stupid! I think it's on par with \\"The Fox and the Hound\\" and \\"Tarzan\\" as one of my least favorite Disney films! The story is too obvious, I know it's going to be a friendship story regarding an outcast and a monster creature. I do not like the idea of Disney doing an outer space movie (although \\"Treasure Planet\\" is okay because it is a fairly ok adaptation), but the way they tell it in THIS is just stupid! All the people in this film look designed like puppet creatures; the eyes, the arms, and the legs! Lilo's voice is annoying and her character is too predictable, and like I said, her human puppet design. Stitch is even more annoying! His design is stupid, his voice is irritating, and his actions are just crazy! This is another one of those movies where there isn't a real traditional villain, and one that I would not let slide! Jumba seems like the villain, then he reforms... and the villain seems to be Gantu... yet he's only doing it because it's his job...then Jumba reforms, IT'S SO FRUSTRATING! I will admit \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" and \\"Finding Nemo\\" don't have a traditional main villain either, but there are too many things I like about those films that I can let it slide. THIS film is nothing of the sort. The only thing that's kind of entertaining about this film is Pleakley, the funny green alien but he is not enough to save the film! I could barely find anything about this film to like. It's one of those overdone Disney films that made me lose interest in Disney for a little while, or at least the hand drawn classics. In my opinion, \\"Lilo and Stitch\\" is definetly a skip!
B001B6EAOY|5.0|does exactly what you want it for , adding mircosd storage to my psp like a boss. three more words
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I just discovered this 2 year series full of uplifting stories told in a very appealing environment.  Naturally network tv couldn't stay with it for a few more years, which surely would have brought an even larger audience.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|fun game, easy to play from the start.lots of action very short cut scenes.would give it a higher rate, but after one week of playing both characters I created were deleted by a glitches.
B00B0IHEWS|5.0|Great Lego product and a great addition to the Star Wars line.  I can recommend this item very, very highly.
B006IYG5HE|1.0|It was too discombobulated. I never could quite understand where the book was taking me so I never could get engaged..
B0042U94UQ|3.0|I have mixed thoughts about \\"Despicable Me\\". I did find it funny and enjoyable more than \\"Megamind\\", another villain movie came out that year. I mean, \\"Megamind\\" did tell a good story, but it more for super heroes against super villains rather than villains in general like \\"Despicable Me\\". I don't LOVE this film, but there are a few things about that stand out about this film...and a few serious problems, on par with \\"Tangled\\".  I like how Gru changes from a bad guy to good guy with the love of the three girls. Margo is responsible and protective, Agnes is very cute, Edith, eh, I tend to overlook her the most out of the three girls, but her tomboy personality is enjoyable. The minions are enjoyably funny as well, and of course some of the jokes. So why don't I love this film the way everyone else does? Because there are 3 cruel mean-spirited characters that kind of ruin the film for me. One is Ms. Hattie the orphanage owner. She's abusive, cruel, and unfunny. If the filmmakers thought Ms. Hattie's cruelty was supposed to be funny, it totally backfires in my opinion. The second is Mr. Perkins of the villain bank. The way he uses age discrimination against Gru is really unfair, and I thought it was obviously meant just for an excuse to help Vector get the moon! The third is Dr. Nefario, Gru's elderly scientist. I just don't like that guy. I found his hearing problem funny at first, but when he forced Gru to get rid of the girls, I stopped thinking positive of him. He didn't even take responsibility for what he did, and Gru ended up taking the blame, when he said he never should have given up the girls. Why should Gru apologize something for he didn't really do? Dr. Nefario was he one who got rid of them. That is a serious flaw! I was actually hoping Dr. Nefario would get fired or die of old age. Overall, despite \\"Despicable Me\\"s problems, I guess I'm okay with it enough to watch with my friends and family. It is funny and all, but I don't think it that great. Now, \\"Despicable Me 2\\" on the other hand...

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Being on the bestseller's list, I feel I must be missing something.  I'm not in to science-fiction, but feel this was a method to bring out the real lesson that I simply didn't get.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|It's Game of Thrones.  That's all you need to know but I'll tell you more.  While I have not read the books, I have heard from others that the HBO series follows the books exactly.  In fact it's easier to follow the series rather than the books.  Quite possibly the best show I've ever seen.  If you like a good story and you're not easily offended, you will like this series.<br /><br />Warning: Lots of nudity, graphic violence, and sex.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The writing continues to be great, though I didn't like the ending I realize its part of the story line. Great characters and still great plots. Can't wait for the 4th Season to being. Keep it coming!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The beginning of this book swept me away and the pathos and incisive depiction of its first half or two-thirds captivated me.  I enjoyed the chronological progression of the story told through the eyes and voice of its characters until it veered off to characters less directly connected to the main thread.  I was disappointed that a stronger connection was never revealed, which - though perhaps more realistic - felt like a lost opportunity.  But, overall, I'm glad I read it.  For a few hours I was someone somewhere else..

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|It's exactly as advertised. My whole family loves this movie, and we're so happy to have found it for a great price!
B005IEGUDY|4.0|I like this for several reasons. 1 - there are a lot of stories in the story, so even though the book is long, it's easy to take in chunks. 2 - I get to learn stuff as I'm being entertained; gravy for the meat. 3 - Really good descriptions for characters and influencing elements of the story. 4 - it takes a long time to read, so I feel I get my money's worth for a month or so.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|UNO & Friends is a great game to play against your friends. My family, friends, and I have played UNO and all the different versions they came out with. I love UNO!
B009NY43NY|3.0|Was good, but in a hurried and anticlimactic kind of way. Not as good as some of her previous Sookie books. Kind of disappointed, but a fun little quick read nonetheless.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|What should had been a one page history book (even according to the author) he turned it into a speculative book with no historical data whatsoever. Now I wonder how acurate are his other best sellers.
B00DHRLK84|1.0|I will start this review like any other review in here that adorns the proper one-star for this film: I read the book, saw the trailers for this movie, and became excited. Perhaps these are clips of our interviewer, Brad Pitt, running to meet up with the people he's going to interview for the book (and it's all being \\"action-packed\\"/stoked up so that little idiots out there can \\"bring themselves\\" to watch it, just like in Looper?), and the scenes with the hordes of zombies are simply flash-backs during said-reviews? Oh, how amazingly inventive is this! Sure, Brad Pitt is the epitome of \\"American acting\\" (which is not acting at all, similar to how \\"America\\" isn't a real nation at all (but I'm just typing that just to 'rustle the jimmies' of the easily enraged)), and the camera-work looks sloppy, but surely this is all just build-up, right?<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />This movie was beyond horrid. Every single aspect about it was ill-thought-out, ill-executed, and over-all insulting. The scenes were wobbly, badly shot, and poorly lit. You had no idea what anyone elses motivation for being there was. You saw people moving around nice and calmly in the middle of Cityville where Brad (his character had a different name, but we're calling him Brad) and his family are driving through to get to Someplaceland (not in panic, they're just taking a holiday), until suddenly the traffic stops moving. Strange, no? This is quite a sticky-wicket seems the situation, since everyone's moving calmly just beyond the grasp of the movie but everyone within it seems to be \\"panicked\\", \\"wary\\", and over-all \\"acting perplexed\\". From what I can remember of the little details, little by little from a trickle of crowd-panic do people begin to fail in an attempt to portray that there is danger coming, that we must get out right away. Traffic from the rear suddenly speeds up, cars crash (seemingly in the other direction, into the cars that are stopped in traffic from the completely other bloody direction (?)) into the back of cars or into the front of them or something similar to those lines (again, the scenes are poorly choreographed and placed, so you have little clue if this is still in Cityville or Someplaceland, or both bizarrely), and suddenly you see Brad and his family looking outside at the people panicking within the streets, being suddenly corralled by soldiers of all things. And, yes, they're still in desert-gear. Way to go with the costume-designs, Brad; you did a good job here.<br /><br />\\"Hey, let's have soldiers walk around in desert-gear!.<br />\\"Why?\\"<br />\\"Why?! Because there's a war in desert-places that presumably is concurrent to this film, of course!\\"<br />\\"But why would urban soldiers have desert gear?\\"<br />\\"Don't question me, or I'll waste another million dollars.\\".<br /><br />But, anyways, Brad and Co. (sporting the bland wife and the typical bland child and One Child With That One Phobia or Thing that seems to be really popular now at days in movies) go out into the street from the safety of their car, seeing one person suddenly bite another! Gasp, will that person get torn to shreds and eaten? No, he will not. There is a reason that millions were wasted on this film, but it's not for awesome gore-effects or make-up for the zombies (spoilers: it was for hair-gel for Brad). No, it was for only what I can guess is for Usain Bolt and the other runners from that sports-thing to come to the set, teach stunt-doubles and body-actors how to run fast, and slap some gray-scale on them and proclaim that they're zombies. Again, good going Brad. The zombies in the book are described as slow, rotting and unnerving corpses of the dead and recently devoured, and you decided to turn them into the Silver Surfer combined with Bolt combined with Charlie Bit My Finger. Can you even read, Brad?<br /><br />Long-story-short, this film is god-awful. I would continue to go on with my synopsis of the plot, but that's the thing: there is no real plot. The \\"writers\\" (not Mel Brooks, an actual writer, but \\"writers\\") decided to leave the story-board with the basic \\"Point A-Point B-Point C\\" method of plot-development, and not actually work on it at all. Clearly, they were too busy trying to figure out how to get the camera to try and kiss Brad even more. The deaths are nonsensical, there is no character to speak of from the characters, and the zombies aren't even zombies. No, I'm not saying that \\"Infected\\" aren't zombies, I'm saying that the zombies in this film are more like Ants than anything. They even make an ant-hill to get over super-walls in a part of Jerusalem (not Jerusalem itself like within the book, just a slum), and onto building-walls later on during the epilogue before being flame-throwered (which somehow works now instead of in Jerusalem).<br /><br />The zombies are six-foot-tall human running ants, the characters are less than cardboard, and the book still needs a movie-release. World War A hardly impresses me beyond it's budget into Brad Pitt's failure as an actor, producer, and over-all human-being.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This is a great CD. A nice mix of his new stuff and songs I havn't heard by him before.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is soo cute! I love the movie despicable me and that's kind of what made me wanna try it. if u like despicable me you will like this game.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|My kids enjoyed it. Some things I have to explain, like telekinesis are not real. Overall, it was entertaining. Thanks!
B000001F6T|5.0|Some goofball wrote that \\"A Sad Song\\" and \\"No Title\\" weren't good songs.  Well, the gene pool produces nature's mistakes all the time and hopefully that reviewer has been both sterilized and is now under psychiatrist-Rx'd meds.  (Seriously, where do these morons come from?)  Buy the album, you won't be disappointed!
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|I Choose this rateing Be cause i am a huge kiss fan. I love this cd even though its re-mastered. All of the songs are very good  i like this one better then the one that came out in 75. I recemend this cd to any-one who is a kiss fan like myself. This cd rocked!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is  Very addictive game. The fun never stops. Will play again and again.my 8 year old loves it. And all of his friends play it too.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|this is super funny and well worth the money.  watch it today seriously you will love it even you guys
B00A81MV3U|3.0|This dvd for some reason started skipping and freezing about half way through.<br />May have to clean my player or use another one. Hope it isn't the dvd, would like to see the whole movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Overall, a very good puzzler, but some floors have me scouring the web for solutions involving obscure clues.  Plus, sometimes my 7&quot; screen just isn't big enough to see what is important.
B009ZE27US|2.0|its fun fast easy prank for your friends<br />you can have lots of fun with this app so go get this app
B009AY04A8|4.0|Hidden object game with a few other types thrown in. Dialog is eh. I turn it off and get to the puzzles. Fun way to spend a few minutes challenging the grey matter.
B00BMT9SQA|5.0|Love Striesand, good movie had to have it for my collection. She is very good at comedy, besides being one of the worlds great singers.
1609611543|5.0|Davis explain why the genetically modified wheat and wheat products are major, if not the major contributing factors behind the global increase in obesity that has been evident since the 1980s. He makes a convincing argument to the effect that radically eliminating wheat products from our diets will help eliminate obesity.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Love this whole CD. Bought his second one and really liked it so went and ordered this one. Great voice1
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book came highly recommended, and I did enjoy the book despite the 3 star rating.  It was a quick, easy read, but I expected more given the rave reviews and popularity.  Though enjoyable, it lacked a theme that will resonate with me for some time.
B003K16P50|5.0|A classic modern day tale for all time. Wonderfully written.  If you liked the movie, you'll love the book more. The book weaves the tale like no movie can because it takes you inside the heart and mind of each character. A read for all ages, all peoples. Its worldly and yet full of faith and hope in the creator.
B004TL0J5M|3.0|The writing is just what we expect from Michael Connelly, a high degree of professionalism, and a cadence and attention to technical detail that leaves the reader with the impression that this is better than a low level television series. But, but, if the reader takes time to think about the whole point of the story, and step away from the pace of the story line, the theme doesn't make sense. If the victim of foreclosure at the height of the financial/mortgage crisis is an organizer of demonstrations against lender abuse there's no way that he or she is going to murder her banker!! And the evidence presented against her, that we only get to see after reading about a hundred pages, isn't particularly impressive. Also we are led to believe that the abused borrower accused of murder is a story that hollywood would pay millions for.This is absurd. If in fact the accused is not guilty, the story has zero value ( so why would an agent who believes in the accused's innocence pay big time cash for the rights to the story?). if the accused is guilty, the story also doesn't have much value because however much people are abused by &#34; the system&#34; murder is not a particularly attractive theme as a solution.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game.  My 7 year old son enjoys also!  Not to difficult and very entertaining for him.  Perfect to his mind thinking.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Product was packaged well, has stood up to abuse for about two months now. Range through one wall appears to be about twenty feet. Battery life is unexpectedly low at about 6 hours of gaming. One software issue...the headset is not being seen by the Logitech software. After initial installation it was recognized, but not since then. Overall though I am pleased with the product.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Addicted to the series and this book did not disappoint.  I cannot wait for the movie and will read anything related to this series.
B00821OX98|5.0|I am an avid reader of Sci-Fi and Sci-Fi Movies, this one is well written and produced.  Looking forward to new adventures.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|Every few years I get the urge to read this incredible classic again. One of the most imaginative and compelling books I've ever read!
B007AL48UK|4.0|I enjoy playing this game during lulls in my work schedule.  I have already shared the game with others including family members.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|It had a little bit of a twist. First book from this author and I enjoyed it very much.  Looked forward to sitting down in the evening and reading it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I found this game pretty addicting. It pretty easy to play and yet still a bit challenging, but not so challenging that it takes the fun out of the game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was my favorite of the series.  I hope there is more motivation to get the third movie release quicker than it has taken this 2nd one.  I hope no one forgets how awesome these books are. That's what happened to Twilight.  Those folks got to greedy and stretched it out so the high-schoolers that started reading it in school were already Doctors when the movies were out.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Great story! The entire book was so intense and made me want to keep on reading! I would recommend this book to anyone!
B00CXQL828|4.0|Musician ship is awsome.  !st listen I wasn't to keen on the choruses but they did grow on me.  Overall like the CD.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I use face book every day to keep informed of what is going on in my friends worlds. I like it but would not pay for it.
B005GSVFB4|5.0|Purchased this for my grandkids but we enjoyed it just as much as they did! Good movie for all ages.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Thank You so much. I really like and enjoy this cd. Love it! Love it!<br />Love it. Love it.<br />Sincerely
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've discovered in recent years. I like that the episodes don't leave you with a feeling of anxiety or anger by the time they reach the end. Yes, there is suspense. Yes, there is drama. And, Yes, there are tears of joy.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Sorry, this did not fix what I needed. this is my 2nd kindle with the same problem and will not purchase another with it lasting a year.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I'm ready for the next one! Too bad I have several months to wait. Either way the book drew me in, I learned to quickly love and hate the main characters. I'm hoping the next books answer some of the questions I have.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|This is my first Pitbull CD.  I enjoyed almost every song, particularly International Love with Chris Brown.  This song is my very favorite and the main reason for ordering this CD.  I am now a Pitbull fan.
B004WDRT1Y|4.0|Purchased this for my grandkids. It could be a little scary for little ones but my 4 yr. old grandson enjoyed it.
B000ASATYO|5.0|Somehow my original copy that I had gotten from Amazon disappeared along with the case it came in, no one will own up to it so I ordered this copy, great movie worth the reorder.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved the series so much, I have ordered the DVD set for seasons 1 through 3 so that my family can watch with me, before we get ready for season 4 to begin,
B00DE76PM8|5.0|I travel alot for my job and this app is extremely helpful in finding your way around major cities.  This and the global subway app are all I needed to get around like I owned the place.
B009R659L8|3.0|I felt  it that it was too slow and bounced around  to keep me interested.  Unlike most of her other novels.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Ho brah. Dis one mean buggah. I watch choke tv. Shootz googles. I go stream mean shows and my aunties and uncles think its da kine.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Love Kelly, she has beautiful voice. The best singer off American idols by far. This CD is for a Kelly fan, all your favorite songs by her on one CD.I Love Love Love it Can't wait for part 2.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I highly recommend this product to anyone who owns a Kindle Fire.  It is durable, easy to use, and keep clean!
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|If you ever seen this movie in HD, it is an absolute treat.  Wish they would make more movies like this classic.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun puzzles. Difficult but not too hard. Only got stumped on level 10. Not like other cheesy apps that sound great but end up being brainless. This one actually makes you feel like you are using your brains.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Im stuck and there no hints or help buttons to help you figure the clues out. Needs a guide like 1000 floors.
B00427W67C|5.0|Hilarious!  Tom Cruise & Robert Downey Jr. killed me in this movie...so funny!  I would definitely recommend this movie when you need a laugh.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|A truly wonderful and twisted season of American Horror Story.<br />Jessica Lange's acting is absolutely top notch.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|Tried it and DELETED it.  You might say I really didn't like it at all.  Purchase GoneMAD Music Player.  Much better.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|FACEBOOK reconnects you with old friends and keeps you current with your family that lives out of town. Such a fun thing!
B0006GANOQ|5.0|First time I saw this movie was on t.v. long after it was in the theaters and available in stores. I looked many places to purchase it and Amazon was there for me. A few clicks on the computer, wait for a couple days to arrive and now I can watch it whenever I want to!
B009NOVCSS|5.0|I love the rolling stones and finally found the most complete set they offer to date.  The packaging is awesome and the band still rules.  Only songs I wouldve liked to see on here are &#34;dead flowers&#34; &#34;cant you hear me knocking&#34; and &#34;sister morphine&#34;  but no worries,  just pick up sticky fingers
B008IGP8RI|4.0|The only shortcoming of this album is that it didn't contain the rhythmic church music from the movie.  That music was the main reason I bought the album and was disappointed in not having it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My kids love this. A great way to let them have the horse they want. Helps them understand the responsibility of taking care of a horse as well as the expense. Highly recommend this
B00D23GXB2|5.0|[[ASIN:B00D23GXB2 Revenge of the Orgasm (The Lust Series)]] To say I was pleasantly surprised by GPA's Revenge of the Orgasm is much too low-key. This author is my secret lover, lost and now newfound. I am intoxicated by his ability to flirt in words like no one else I've ever heard or read.  I have always been attracted to subtlety. GPA has the breakthrough writing brand that exemplifies, even glorifies this quality. Job well done, Sir, because I am not good any more; I am jood !! Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates sensual reading.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Have a question about how to cook something or fix something or even a new hair style....You can find it on Pinterest!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Haven't had any problems with my Kindle Fire case. I really like the sleek look and the viewing stand. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a great quality, low-price product!
0307341550|3.0|It was okay. Would I read it again? Maybe. Definitely not as good as Flynn's, &#34;Gone Girl.&#34; It was very dark...
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I've always been very intrigued by the work this guy's perform, and this book delivered a very vivid picture of the missions they execute...excellent book...
B00AATV046|5.0|This was a gift for my wife.  What a great movie, one of the all time greats.  Now we don't have to wait for it to be on TV and put up with the commercial breaks.  Her all time favorite Christmas movie.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This game is awesome. The number of items to is just enough to one interested and busy. I am going to tell my game playing friends about it.@
0201485672|5.0|I think this is a good experience share. Software developers usually write code, manage code. But this developers (Martin Fowler and others) are working on beatutify the written code. All examples are on Java, but C# developers or other OOP language developers can understand. This book helped me to understand what good code is. Thanks so much Martin Fowler and Friends.
B00004SC8T|4.0|Originally I only gave it one star because, for some reason, I, who live in the eastern US, was sent a \\"Region 4\\" DVD & therefore couldn't play it. The sender sent me a long confusing form for returning it, & it cost more to return it than to just throw out the disk, & keep the case for replacing any cracked ones I might have in the future. That's what I did, then recently (late 2014) finally a Region 1 DVD became available here. Bought it, & I like the movie. The teamwork is similar to the \\"Mission Impossible\\" gang in the TV series (NOT the non-canon movie!). I certainly recommend it.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|The game is very entertaining.  Patience is needed in the research  lab. If your going it alone, it takes far too many tries to fully research one. Especially in the higher levels. It is setup to have your online friends help you out.  Otherwise be prepared to spin the dials 70 something times and spend 8-9 hundred thousand coins to complete.  Tip: start buying food early and keep buying every time you play. Every time you upgrade, therenis an interesting factoid about the creatures.  This game is for all ages.
B005FISBTO|4.0|In the Showtime preview at the beginning of each disc, there is a MAJOR spoiler that kind of ruins this entire season. Not sure what they were thinking. Otherwise liked it fine.
B000I0QL82|5.0|My favorite Christmas movie.  Bing Crosby is the lead and is classic Bing.  A Broadway star who retires to an inn that is only open for the holidays.  A bit unrealistic but is a comedy and a love story as Bing gets his girl.  I don't think you will be disappointed especially if you like black and white movies.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is such a great workout, and such a great video.  Jillian is demanding, but also very encouraging.  She believes in you and, after her program, you will believe in yourself.  I have so many workout DVDs at home, my husband laughed at me when I ordered this.  He asked &#34;What makes this one different from all the others you never used?&#34;  The answer, it works!  And, it's a 20 minute workout.  Everyone has 20 extra minutes a day, I don't care who you are.  I have 2 toddlers, work full time, I do everything around our home by myself because my husband is traveling 80% of the time for work, and I still can find the 25 minutes it takes to do this video everyday.  Great price, great video!  Order it, you won't be sorry!
0201633612|4.0|I think this is leadership of the other design patterns books. This is a great reference that included sample codes in C++. This book will stand as a foundation of software development for years.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It is working just great I wish it could get rid of the files that are adding up in my vplayer though
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I've been a QOTSA fan for 10 years and every album has been a little different, but they continue to be great.
B007HACDLK|4.0|\\"The Last Man\\" by Vince Flynn is another kick-butt, take no prisoner, storyline from a formulaic storyteller who captured the essence of the testosterone driven action/adventure/thriller narrative that is so badly needed by a nation that is starving for competent leadership.  Vince Flynn exemplifies competence, action, and the ability to understand right from wrong, he is a super-patriot in real life and his recent sudden-death is a huge loss to me and his millions fans! 4 stars!!!!
B0000042MY|5.0|I wore my first CD out.  This is one of my favorite soundtracks.  The music is hauntingly beautiful, filled with passion, and southing to the soul. Every time I listen to it, I can almost picture which part of the movie the music is from.  Good movie and great music!
B009AY04A8|4.0|Although there are some things need to be straightened out, the game is fun. The lag between things seems over long, and some of the puzzles are just strange. But, like I said, the game is fun.
0596007124|5.0|This is really head first book about object oriented wrapped design patterns. I understood the patterns easily with visual expressions. The expression language is very clean. The examples that selected by writers are makes understandable the patterns.  If you do not know design patterns I recommend this book to learn. Bu this book is not for who want to learn enterprise patterns.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Read this book! It is very very very good. You will enjoy it immensely. I hope you enjoy this book!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|VERY addictive...My kids also love it. I can set it on the table drop a few coins and work on cleaning up the house then drop a few more coins.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|\\"Ready Player One\\" by Ernest Cline is a YA barnburner for all the digit-heads/propeller heads and the rest of those addicted to good sci/fi stories people. With a brilliant cast of characters, dramatic game-scene settings, and quirky teen habits and vernacular, this a story that will energize and entertain you now and for years of reflection. Just plain fun and entertaining...BRILLIANT! 5 stars!!!!!
0553384775|1.0|I bought this book because I saw the ad for the movie that is coming out (with Leonardo DiCaprio) and thought it would be interesting to have more detail than what the movie is likely to cover. I have bought and enjoyed several of the &#34;crash/recession&#34; books and would say most were pretty good in that I learned something new. I expected some four and 14-letter words but this was ridculous! He's not a good writer and if you blanked out all of the obscenities about 80% of the words would be gone. And it is not just the curse words - some is just plain crude and stuff that contributes nothing to the story line. What a waste of money and I have no idea how they will make this into a movie - and I sure won't pay to see it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is vary good game if you can put more updates on this game that would make me play all day and night
B0052GWIAW|5.0|The incredible Michael Frank! I fell in love with this man's voice when I was fifteen years old! The album, was SKIN DIVE... the song, When She Is Mine... And then it was The Sleeping Gypsy, album.  And who can forget, The Lady wants to Know.  Or the sizzling, Rainy Night in Tokyo. And I could name more songs, hit after hit, Michael Franks, never misses a beat. His timing is on key!  The jazz melodies oozes from his musical pores. He's ability to ease up and down on notes his effortless!  The lyrics emerge from his lips like a vintage rhyme. Every word is precalculated. This man is phenomenal! His music just gets better with time! My how time flies, Based on his music alone, it's hard to believe, Michael Franks is almost 70 years old!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|It was great until it wanted to update and now all I get is a message telling me &#34;server is not available please try again.&#34; This has gone on for four days. I have spent actual money in this game and now I can't use it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This works very good have had this on my device for a year and hasn't not woken me up once
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 6yr old loves this game. She always likes to play it.She also likes other games like this one. Good way to keep her entertained, when it's nasty outside.
B002C949KE|5.0|IT IS the book you should read once in your life.<br /><br />We observed many phenomenon daily but never got any proof that they exist - until Dan introduced his funny and interesting experiments in Human behaviour.<br /><br />Of course, don't throw out your Economics textbook. Your teachers may still know Economics only from those old theories.<br /><br />Highly recommends
B00632HWOG|5.0|It's awe some. I like how I can make changes. It's better than the old one. The set up is real easy to read.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Nice game.  Fun to play and worth the time. Check it out. A very Nice re make of an arcade classic.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|you need a strong wireless signal to make this work and the newer / faster processor you are streaming from helps
B008OOYALE|5.0|The app looks amazing,and you can pretty much do whatever you want.  Breed dragons,save coins,and have friends with your storm8ID (witch you make in the game) and you can connect other storm8 games to it.  It's a great app.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|We can all learn from a book like this... Learn from the past and become all you can. Will be looking for her next book and hike
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This is a great app.  Often when I take a photo I find I have too much background or I'm not quite centered; problem solved!  Takes a lot of the guesswork out of taking the &quot;perfect&quot; shot.  Thanks for making all my pics look great.
B000QXDED6|4.0|Young men loved this and made it a blockbuster mainly for the special effects and the blood & guts. OK<br />Mature men loved it for the traditional &#34;male&#34; things of honor and glory and lets beat the bad guys.<br />Women loved it for Gerry and his extraordinary body and the true love he shows for his strong, smart wife.<br /><br />Anyone, regardless of age or gender, can find something appealing in this unusual, interesting, completely different movie. Yes, the special effects are eye-popping, even today when we're inundated with effects. These are quieter and stranger. There is a surreal quality to them that works. Yes, the story (although not strictly historically accurate) is a classic tale of sacrifice and honor to which any thinking person will respond to with pride and sadness. Yes, Gerard is gorgeous and the perfect King for his time, but he is more: he is the personification of the noble warrior, the reluctant warrior, who would rather make love to his wife and raise his son than fight the invaders, but does what &#34;a free man&#34; has to do to stay free.<br /><br />There is some gratuitous violence and grossness - I could have done without the leprosy-ridden priests and the malformed Persians. And, yes, there is no attempt at political correctness. Thank goodness. That was not a popular concept in ancient Sparta and would have been ridiculous if it had been inserted into this movie.<br /><br />This is a film that grows on you. A film that is better at the 2nd viewing and will surprise you with things you missed at the 3rd viewing. It's not for everyone but, if your mind is open, you can enjoy it on whatever level works for you.
B0090O07S2|5.0|If you love the Doors, you'll love this. If you've never heard of the Doors, what's the matter with you?
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|For those of you who like Team Fortress 2 or action-packed, wacky MP in general, this is a great game. The graphics are bright and well done, and the controls are surprisingly accurate. Highly recommended
B005LAII4E|5.0|Good acting.  great actors and story line. It keeps you<br />interested up to the end. I really enjoyed it too!
B0046OOUIE|4.0|I thought this was a fairly good release for Clapton. Not his best work, and certainly not as good as the Robert Johnson originals, but a decent blues album in its own right. A couple of the tracks had already been released on \\"Unplugged\\" and nearly all the tracks are full band setup (something that seems to really offend some of the other reviewers here), but personally I don't see the reason for all the negative reviews. Maybe I'm just not as picky as some others. I can put this CD in anytime and tap my feet and sing along and enjoy myself, so, to me, the album is good. Clapton is no Robert Johnson, but then who is....he's a good blues man in his own right and the same can be said for this album.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|:) This game is really fun!!!<br />I suggest if your a horse lover like i am to get this game :)<br />This game has a ton of small games of taking good care of horses :)
B00AEBB8QK|4.0|I loved the book by Michael Crichton. The film is quite different but if you can get past this, you can enjoy it on it's pure entertainment level. A young Gerry Butler shows the hunk appeal and charisma that will come into full bloom later in Phantom of the Opera. His character and section of the storyline is the most watchable part of the film. the other actors (mostly unknowns) are less successful, especially Paul Walker who can't act worth a damn. But the film is fast paced, interesting and not a waste of time if all you're in the mood for is popcorn, wine and a couple of hours of fun.
1452126577|5.0|The sweet kitty with the grumpy face always makes me laugh. A book to cheer after a tough day at work.
B001GUXJQA|3.0|This is a good yarn.  The clues are slowly revealed at just the right pace to keep the reader interested and even a few times anticipating the next revelation.  I would read more of his books if not for what is discussed in the next paragraph.<br /><br />The story line is captivating but the language used by Connelly's characters is over the top in my opinion.  In Connelly's efforts to make his story &#34;realistic&#34; (I guess), he uses the more shocking 4-letter words to an excess, at least to my taste.  What for?  What does it add to the story?  Maybe people do talk that way in the professions and life-styles he is recounting, but I neither like to hear it and neither do I enjoy the characters more because the gutter language he has them use to an excess.  Maybe his word processor knows if he starts a word with an &#34;s&#34; or an &#34;f&#34; it automatically fills in the other three inappropriate letters.  (That is probably as specific as I can get here).<br /><br />Connelly is an excellent writer and story teller, no doubt about it.  I like his character development and attention to detail in his descriptions of his settings.  I just think that some of what I mention above, if not all of it, could be left out and those aspects would not suffer.  I know he is very successful and I am obviously too sensitive in comparison to most people.  But I mention this as a warning to others who may find this issue important.  That's what a reviewer should do I think.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|If you are a fan of Khaled Hosseini than you will enjoy this book.  I didn't love it as much as his last two novels but it was still a wonderful read. Enjoy!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very captivating. The chapters were great. I had a hard time putting it down. I can't wait for the next room
B0035S996U|2.0|I am a 70's child (teen).  Thus, it is good reminiscing the past, quirky movie about fantasy gangs.  Their were allot of gangs in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn.  The movie still have some bad acting and light violence for the times or these times.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I am finding it difficult to get rid of bubbles because I just can't seem to go beyond the first screen to get to the top.  Enjoyable but frustrating.
1452658382|5.0|This is a book I've been waiting for. The author has been teasing the readers with glimpses of Kaleb Krychek for some time. Is he a good guy? A bad guy? Does he only have his own agenda or does he have a moral compass? In this book, you find out the answer to all of the above is `yes'...<br /><br />If you've been following this series, you start the book knowing some things about Kaleb. He is an incredibly strong telekinetic cardinal. He is a member of the Psy Council. He has a tentative alliance with the Arrows. He was raised, if that is the right word, by counselor Enrique - the serial-murdering villain from Slave to Sensation. And he's looking for someone--someone from his past--someone who seems to have been erased...<br /><br />And he finds her. Mostly. She's tortured, starved, and abused but alive. But her mind? Her shields have been stripped and she seems lost within her own mind. As the story progresses you find that while her shields were ripped from her, she created the labyrinth herself. Created as a self-defense mechanism, she believes she built in a method to escape - now if she could only remember what it was...<br /><br />The story arc of the series has been exploring the possibilities of rebellion, the collapse of the PsyNet, and the fall of silence. We discover that much of this hangs on the ability of Kaleb to heal his lady. If she falls, the world will fall with her - Kaleb will see to it.<br /><br />This is an incredibly moving love story between a woman who considers herself broken and a powerful man who considers himself Silent. Both of them are wrong...  And the sex? Let's just say that when they make love the earth moves - literally. And there is no question, it IS love. Everything he has done has been to find her, heal her, and protect her.<br /><br />Nalini Singh has managed to keep her Psy/Changeling series alive and thriving.  Her characters are strong, people you would like to know. Her plots manage to advance the series story-arc whilestill accomplishing a satisfying end to each book. Each book brings new material to light without violating any of the previous books. (I hate it when authors call their books a series but don't bother to maintain consistency from book to book.  But maybe that's just me.)<br /><br />I loved this book but don't start here if you've never read any of the earlier ones.  This is a series best read in order.<br /><br />Below is the chronological reading order according to the author's website:<br />1. \\"Beat of Temptation\\" in Wild Invitation<br />2. \\"Whisper of Sin\\" in Burning Up<br />3.

B009AY04A8|4.0|I got it as th  free app of the day. It's simple but entertaining. You're allowed ample time to complete tasks. The only thing I don't like is the between dialogue characters and the graphics make it hard to spot some items. But overall I'm enjoying playing the game.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is cool it make time pass for me. If you role playing games you will like this one.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast was easy to setup. In just a few simple steps I had it working with no issue. You need to use an Android device or PC to set it up after that you can use Netflix on your IPAD. It works great.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I am playing this game on my Kindle and I am trying to move the robot around and just not able to get it to move where I want.  Other than that, I really like this game.
0399255370|5.0|My grandson made me read this book twice before lunch.. and then again later in day.  It's clever, funny and has an interesting story.. one which kids will understand. (adults will end up laughing out loud, trust me)
B00004SZWD|5.0|Love this &#34;album&#34;.  I got it in record form when it originally came out.  Since I don't have a stereo anymore, decided to get the CD
1451695195|4.0|An interesting read and subject.  I also gave some as gifts to people who are interested in this subject.<br />I thought it was well-written and unique coming from a medical professional.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I am anxiously awaiting the last book.  Will have it read in one day when I get this next book.  Will definitely have it pre-ordered so I don't miss it!

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|A real brain teaser.  Some of the steps are a little frustrating because the time runs out before you can find the next clue.  I am still enjoying it.
B00E1L9N8E|2.0|Too sensationalized, although the acting was good, the stylization of the Hampton's take away from poignancy of what the book was essentially try to get at - the decline of American values in the 1920s.
0425062651|1.0|but the book binding cracked and all the pages fell out..<br />other than that I was happy<br />thank you very much

1444765426|4.0|Really found audio book helpful and thought provoking, but decided this was a book I should own so I could revisit. Shared Chapt. 4 with the psychology class at Siena and will continue to integrate some of the ideas--smart, quick and doable--just need to get into the habit of it!  Haven't &#34;reread&#34; the full book, as I'd like to do the exercises as I read.  Worth the money for sure.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After reading the first two books in the series, I found it difficult to put this down.  I just had to know about Katniss!  Absolutely loved the book.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great show loved just about every episode<br />now in my current top 10 shows currently on air.<br />could use a little more criminal law,
B003G4W49C|4.0|Enders Game is a complicated tale of how young children, mostly boys, are taken from their parents to assist the government on a futuristic earth. This story centers around gifted children and the price they and their family pay to attempt to save the planet. While is has plenty of action and adventure, much of it focuses on the relationships between the boys and how their naive competitiveness spawns a hope for all humanity.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written and great plot. I love when stories have an ending that you &#34;don't see coming&#34;. I recommend this book.
B00406UK7S|5.0|A great period movie made even more credible by its superb cast, including actor Michael Fassbender.  The action is fast and well choreographed; the drama constant and unpredicatable; and the overall storyline cohesive.  The scenary and imagery is also way above average.  A great movie for those who love this period of history!
B003F7Y0VU|5.0|My daughter and I loved it.. the animation was great and the story was great.. would recommend.. great movie.. immediately
030746363X|4.0|Lots of great information and tests that he does is proof weight loss testing on him self. How to have great sex with your other just fantastic. amazing

B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game I play it every day and night weekday to weekend  I play it with my family and friends
1400069289|5.0|The reasons for developments of habits are complex, and this book touches on that issue, but mainly explores how forcing habits can help to control impulses and individual thoughts.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Just started playing and so far am impressed. We shall see if it remains entertaining after 30 levels. Very similar to the classics.
0443069522|5.0|Organized by body region, not by system.  Green box content highlights clinical applications.  I've got a dozen other anatomy resources, but this one is indispensable.
B00DH4BL8Q|4.0|liked the story, some of the repetition of the story was a bit annoying, but the series was a fun read
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I am not a fan of addons that try to force you to purchase more things to play the game.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|Great voices. Each unique. Well-blended. I have been listening to most of the songs over and over again. Truly wonderful!! Anyone who has a great appreciation for traditional music SHOULD purchase this album. It will inspire.
B004FHBO9K|4.0|Well package and worthwhile the money. One of the great music LPs that I have purchased and interesting for pure enjoyment.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I at first when I started playing, it froze points not give. I have noticed lately the changes made are not always for the best.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I would truly recommed this book to any one who is a great lover animals.<br /><br />Loved Loved Loved it!!!! xoxoxox
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|Not a true game, but a FaceBook &#34;game&#34;, designed to use long waits to make you want to spend money on in-game money.  That would be forgivable but for the fact that there is no challenge to the game, aside from patience, and it runs very poorly on my Kindle.
B00AB55BS0|3.0|Blood, gore, and  more twist and turns than a roller coaster. Not for teens or young children. I got caught up at the very first episode and had the purchase the second season and now waiting for the third season.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this. show. WOWIE! I adore period shows and this is no exception.  Well done, BBC. The Brits have a special place in this Korean-American heart.
B000F8O35U|5.0|my daughter loves it!!<br />i give it a 110!!!<br />All I hear her say around the sea &#34;under the sea&#34; &#34;kiss the girl&#34;<br />makes her happy!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love to play bingo and the slots.  It would be nice to get more Bingo credits or be able to place in the upper 3 every once in a while.  Seems like some games Bingo is called when barely 4 or 5 balls are called.  Still, it is fun to play!
B000FA675C|5.0|Keeps you on the side of your seat the whole way through. Love Robert Langdon, great character; excited to read more of his adventures. Also love that Dan Brown gets facts to support his book!
0440237688|4.0|I liked this book! It was different and more interesting than most books I've read. It was a very different place and time than I usually expect in a book. I also didn't like this book because I wanted it to continue. I recommend this book to anybody who likes an interesting book about a weird look at what the future might be like, because that is  what the book seemed to be about.<br /><br />-Joe B.<br />.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|A classy, classic, funny, sad, romantic, unpredictable, film. It has &#34;legs&#34;...seeing it again and again<br /> and again is still a pleasure.
B009NYF2ES|1.0|This is a great movie and I would not complain if it was sold as a DVD. But to sell this DVD as a BLU RAY is<br />deceitful.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game itself is pretty fun. But the fact that you only have a certain amount of energy to do the puzzles makes it kind of irritating to play.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|This is a Harry Nilsson collector set, but so much more. The alternate takes and demos are great. Nilsson Sings Newman, Harry, are master pieces by any standard.<br />I had aot of this material, but three CD's of very rare material is fantastic.<br />The sound on the Nilsson Schmillson alum is incredible
B004KKX80A|4.0|My daughter has pulled me into Bayblade world. To keep her happy, I learnt about them, and also started enjoying them to an extent. Compared to other bay blades, this one really has a Big Bang!!  So it is good.  Go for it ...
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Really enjoyable to listen to, cant help but sing along.<br /><br />Very uplifting music, also. I leave it on when I am driving.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app! It is so much fun and makes your mind think. It's easy to get addicted to this app.
B004YF6MHW|2.0|I don't know, I just did not like this app maybe it was because I was looking for more it was just like my regular everyday already built in camera app, maybe the issue was with my phone. Anyways I deleted it 2 days after I downloaded it.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Brad Pitt is convincing as a disciplined, pugnacious, iconoclastic baseball theorist who defies traditional wisdom about how to win in the majors---without the Yankees' pocketbook.  A triumph of reasoned faith over &#34;the way we always did it.&#34;
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|This a wonderful, well written novel with a complex, interesting protagonist. The Bat (the first in the series) so turned me on that I purchased all of his remaining series at one time and have the last one on order .<br /><br />Hal Sterling
B00E9PMMX0|1.0|Seems like all they did was take the old editions and slap them together in one box, which of course have the added cartoony CGI effects, changed dialogue, etc.  Be patient, just a few more years and Disney will finally release what Lucas was so stubborn about releasing.  Even watching old VHS tapes are better than buying this supporting them and encouraging that it's okay to release this tainted masterpiece.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game can keep you entertained for hours. The only thing I don't like is that you run out of energy.
159102594X|5.0|This is top notch fantasy. It's got it all, magic, battles, armies, and dirty politics. I couldn't put the book down and raced through the entire trilogy. Good stuff.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|An intelligent, well-directed cast of flawed but likeable characters face their aging with courage and irony and hope.  And by golly, they do just fine. And the music is splendid
B0064X7FVE|1.0|On many occasions I am not able to open on Kindle Fire. (had no problem with previous version) . Not as simple to use either.
B003PGNBNY|3.0|THE MOVIE IS JUST OK NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT I PERSONALLY THINK DEMI L.. TRIED TO HARD IN THIS MOVIE
B0055QYKQO|4.0|Bought this board because my older mobo's Ethernet slot stopped working, so I took the bullet and bought a more expensive mobo for future upgrading. After buying this, I also purchased a 2nd card to do SLI, works perfectly except, I seen there are 2 extra x16-x4 slots not sure what they are for? since this is only a 2way sli&crossfire board.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Another movie I missed in the theater, so I bought the DVD.  Being a fan of the books and having seen &#34;Wicked&#34;, this was an interesting take on them all.  Definitely some scenes not for young children, as they'd probably be frightened.  Lots of subplots and interesting clues that Oz fans will recognize.  Enjoyed the movie a lot!
B004NOCCEG|5.0|A homeless man can shoplift food and will get arrested; a Wall Street Executive can steal millions through fraudulent behavior and not only doesn't get arrested, they get to keep the money. This is disturbing to me.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is the best game you can ever have I have the other apps but this is the best app EVER totally recommend it
0767817478|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE I GUESS IT CAME FROM ME WATCHING THE OLDER VERSION OF IT BUT THIS ONE WAS SO GOOD AND THE WAY THE MADE GODZILLA ALL BIG AND TALL JUST MADE HIM LOOK EVEN MEANER THEN THE OLD MOVIES
1927628091|4.0|\\"Yes, of course duct tape works in a near vacuum. Duct tape works anywhere. Duct tape is magic and should be worshiped.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Martian\\" is a fun read, like MacGyver on Mars. Author Andy Weir obviously has done a lot of research and he makes the science understandable and believable. Wisecracking astronaut Mark Watney is the 6th member of the Ares 3 Mars landing crew, the third manned mission to Mars. Ares 3 is scheduled to last two months, but due to an epic dust storm that threatens the crew's ascent craft they have to bug out after 6 days. Watney gets separated from the crew in the storm and they are forced to abandon him, believing him to be dead.<br /><br />Luckily Watney is a Mechanical Engineer with amazing ingenuity. His communications have been knocked out by the storm, so he is forced to think and work to solve problems on his own. He takes stock of his supplies and realizes that since they were designed to support 6 for two months, he can stretch them much further since he is alone. They won't last long enough for the next mission, however, so he has to improvise. He finds some real potatoes packed for their Thanksgiving dinner, so he devises a way to farm them in the habitat. For this he needs soil, bacteria in the soil, water, more oxygen, etc. He works to solve one problem at a time, believably and ingeniously. Other problems follow including restoration of communications, unforeseen explosions, and just about anything else you can think of that can go wrong. Through it all, however, Watney's winning personality and smarts keep us riveted.<br /><br />I liked how Watney thinks and works to solve problems on his own, without much outside help from NASA. Communications are very limited and he essentially is on his own throughout most of the book. Another reviewer brought up the 1964 film \\"Robinson Crusoe on Mars,\\" which is also one of my favorite B movies. The stories are much different, but the idea of the marooned individual relying on his own resourcefulness to persevere remains very appealing. There are no miraculous quick fixes here. He works each problem logically, with the materials he has on hand.<br /><br />The cut scenes back on earth, although understandably needed to give breaks in the story, at first come across as a bit corny. They grow on you however as they lend a much-needed perspective to the enormity of what Watney is trying to accomplish. The characters are given very little background, and very short shrift is given to the family members of any of the crew or NASA employees. Mark's family is barely mentioned other than a few passing references to his parents. It robs the reader of some of the emotional impact of the story, but keeps us focused on the nuts and bolts of what needs to be done next. Also the story arc is a bit predictable, if the outcome is not. It seems that every time Mark mentions that things are going well something catastrophic happens. This happens with such regularity that it almost becomes comical by the end of the book. Each challenge, however, is another opportunity for Mark to show his tremendous resourcefulness and ingenuity.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to space buffs as well as to fans of castaway literature (\\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" \\"Castaway,\\" \\"The Swiss Family Robinson,\\" et al.). It is a fun, near-future cowboy seat-of-your-pants mission to Mars. I am looking forward to more offerings from promising author Andy Weir.resourcefulness to persevere remains very appealing.

B0042EJD8A|5.0|I had no idea just how bad this process is for our #1 precious resource; water. I learned so much from this documentary and hope people realize we can't allow this to continue. I am amazed, or a better word choice is shocked, that we are allowing this to continue. Josh Fox is a hero in my book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Was waiting for something like this as all the other options either are complex to set up or costly or both.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like this game a lot.my husband and I play it together. Like your own little Sherlock at your fingers . Passes the time and you gotta build up to new levels after time plus it doesn't cost anything
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|In these episodes, the entire cast have become extremely comfortable in their roles and play them expertly. This results in some of the best performances yet, and again well written scripts entertain us with their drama and thought-provoking situations. Even a non-fan can sit down, watch a couple episodes and find a lot to like here.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|FAOTD download. The game is quite fun and challenging. Trying to lead targets etc can get tricky. Loads of fun
B00C5R8364|5.0|SECOND FORSYTH BOOK IN ONE MONTH. I LOVED THE COBRA BUT THIS ONE EXEDED. THE PLOT IS VERY INTERCONECTED AND KEEPS YOU CONNECTED. READ IN TWO DAYS.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Asylum is a different storyline than the first season. Some of the same actors (playing different characters). It's very unique and well done. If you like horror/sci fi, you will not be disappointed. Great show!
B003L7DK6U|5.0|This was for my husband who is a huge Lee fan, he was very happy.  I didn't know that they made old movies on blu ray!
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|great movie,,,,,liam neeson is great in any movie .....although taken was a lot better. cant wait for his next movie.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|This CD makes you want to get up and move even if you are not in the mood. Can't say anything bad about any of the songs.
034580404X|4.0|It was a good book, but am a bit shy when it comes to sex so I was skipping through the sex scenes a lot. But overall nice, enjoyed reading it.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. I especially thought the acting of the boys was very good. They really captured the dynamics of young teenage boys hanging out together and finding adventure. Great film!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really awesome for the horse lovers out there. I only wish that you could have the option of choosing your first horse. Anyway, very cool game.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It felt so real with the description of how the characters felt , and really good action in it I say the best Rick Riordan!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|great book so far.  having to read it when I can.  Looking forward to see what all the hype is about.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I've enjoyed reading most of the book because I am able to dismiss conjecture and &#34;fillers&#34;.  The general historical references were interesting but after that nothing compares to reading the Bible and faith and belief in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior.  I felt like I was reading one of Clive Cussler's fictionalization of history with a story with the traditional characters missing.  I admit Ihaven't finished reading it but continue to read as a continued historical lesson of the period and jewish/Roman customs during the period.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|Wanted application to work with my files in Dropbox and made me download AntTek Exp before even downloading this application.  However, this application won't even open up.  Great that it is free because that is all it's worth.
6302581907|5.0|We have watched this movie over-and-over since it was released, and each time we watch it, we enjoy it just as much as the very first time. I adore Whoopi Goldberg, and have watched almost every movie she has been in. Her acting performance in this movie and Sister Act 2 is a sensation. This has become one of our favorite for comedy entertainment, and the performance of the entire cast is superb. The intriguing, fun story has you drawn in immediately as you become curious to find out what Whoopi's bad boyfriend is up to next, with concern for her safety. The movie has it all, including laugh-out-loud fun. In addition, we enjoyed the happy ending, and the music is fantastic. Hilarious and entertaining throughout. Highly recommended!
B0091LS07E|5.0|Great album of music. Have enjoyed listening to it in my car and home.  Great voice and great choice of music selections
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|THis much heralded series came out a few years ago, we purchased it and gave it to my father-in-law, a World War II Marine who fought in the Pacific Theater.  The scenes, the acting and the believability are excellent.  Since I enjoy war movies (though as a war veteran, I hate war), I highly recommend this as one that puts you into the hearts and minds of our Marines during the War.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I liked this book, enough to buy the next two books. The very beginning of the book was a little slow, and I didn't like that they didn't really speak much about Megan's past beyond her ex husband, and there was even less about his first wife. That being said, it didn't make me not like the book.<br /><br />There are some poor reviews about grammar errors in this book. Yes, they are there. Was it bad enough to make you want to put the book down? No. I look at it this way: The book was decent. Want a book with no errors? Don't get a free book. They  were not so bad that you need to put the
B008518MOW|5.0|This movie was very enjoyable to me to see, especially after seeing the other Men in Black movies. This movie was refreshing and kept my interest throughout.

B001EL6EHC|5.0|One of the most popular of Bogart's movies, this is a classic that shouldn't be missed.  Rick (Bogey) runs a saloon in Casablanca and is &#34;neutral&#34; as the world around him is at war, every nation that is except the United States.  It is late 1941 and the Nazi government has sent the nasty Nazi Gestapo officer, Major Strausser (who is played by in real ife an even zealot of hatred towrd Hitler and his Nazi) to make sure the underground hero Victor Lazlo doesn't leave Casablanca, to continue his work with the world wide underground organization.  Rick isn't unknown to the Gestapo either, as he wasa a gun runner who fought in the Spanish Civil War against Franco and the Germans.  Rick finds that he can't escape a long lost love (Ingrid Bergman) who is with her husband, Laslo.  Dooley Wilson sings &#34;You Must Remember This&#34; or better known as &#34;As Time Goes By.&#34;
B00932A4XE|5.0|I love this movie!  A must see if you're a mom or a mom to be.  I had all my sister-in-laws over and we giggled all night!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I reviewed the movie before allowing my kids to watch it and I am glad I did. My kids are six and I got a sense that they would not understand what was going on (too advanced). Personally, I loved the movie.
B000FC146C|5.0|I remember in the late 1970s a very dear friend of mine reading this. He was engrossed with it. When I found it on kindle I decided to read for myself some 30 years later. He was right. The story is superbly written. I could barely put it down and hated for it to end.
B000UJ48U4|4.0|This Stanley Kubrick film about a doctor (Cruise) and his wife (real life wife at the time, Kidman) looking into the world of sex and a secret society of rituals threaten his livilhood and his family.  This film was released four months after Kubrick's death and because of his subject matter, it brings into question as to whether he was the target of the Ilumini and their hitmen or whatever.  We will never know, though what we do know is that this is probably the most misunderstood movie of the late 20th Century.  The orgy gives it an &#34;R&#34; rating but the European version would make it &#34;X&#34; over here, if you can find it.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|The music, the dancing, the humor, the memories!  Olivia Newton John, John Travolta, and Stockard Channing at their best!  Makes me want to sing &#34;We'll Always...Be Together&#34; to high school friends.
B001F12J48|2.0|Red and blue 3D glasses were not expected and the picture did not have a clear 3D look. The picture was blurry. My six year olds did not like the movie within seconds of putting on the glasses and refused to watch the movie.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I thought it end the show the way I would have ended it. It cleared up all the mystery behind unmasking gossip girl to find out that it was in face a man and a member of the tight elite group. Also loved that all your favorite characters ended up with their true loves !!!
B007KDFWRG|4.0|If you have ever seen this band live, you know live is the only way to listen to them. cd is good quality and has some of their latest songs.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I've played Angry Birds on my computer and thought it mildly interesting (Ok, I admit it.  I have played Angry Birds on my computer for hours and hours).  But, this app was frustratingly difficult compared to the computer version and I deleted it soon after trying it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Totally understandable for fifth graders to have life changing years...but Auggie helps change many lives for the best!  Loved this easy read with big lessons!
B004HD61KE|3.0|Rollins is always an interesting read.  His facts are well researched, and one of the most interesting aspects of his books is the section at the end, where he explains what is fact (almost everything) and what is fiction regarding weapons, places and history in his novels.<br /><br />I found the climax of Devil Colony to be somewhat anti-climactic compared to the rest of his page-turners that I have read so far.  However, that will not stop me from moving on to the next book in short order, after a side trip to Dan Brown's newest.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Loved having the whole collection in one box.  We watched them one after another and never lost the thread of the story. I highly recommend it.
0316228583|2.0|Still absorbed by teenagers and unrealistic fantasies-- author seems to have little understanding of deeper adult emotions. If it's supposed to be a character study, none are very well developed, and the story is so thin you can skip entire sections without losing the thread. I wouldn't have bothered if one of my friends had read it first and warned me off
B0060AY6FO|3.0|... But not great either. My first PD James and I'm wondering what all the fuss is about. Saw the outline of the mystery coming early on and felt no urgency getting there.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Love the price and I did it, I just cut my first bottle, 30 more to go, but it was so easy, I was trying to buy it for many months but after I read some of the comments I didn't know what to choose, and last day I thought &#34; I need to get one in home and try and I did it and I choose the right one, I don't know it the others ones are that easy too, but I am really happy with mine, because the first try and I get a perfect cut.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game for when you don't want to use your brain too much. Runs well on 2 year old phone with no real lag. Nice.
B00ATP24NW|5.0|I heard &#34;Radioactive&#34; on the radio and loved it, so I purchased the entire album. I couldn't be more pleased with the music and have enjoyed listening to the CD in my car as well as having the digital download for my Kindle Fire HD. Imagine Dragons rocks!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is beautifully written, performed, and filmed. The story is moving and heartbreaking and the path through the mystery is intriguing and smart.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|The grand kids downloaded this app. I don't play it, so not too knowledgeable about it. The kids seem to like it though.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|The movie its self was good for a horor flick. But don't think it is a direct remake of the original.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like both this game and the claw game by game circus.  Both are a great way to kill some time.  I would not bother spending real money for coins (or drops in the claw game), but it seems to regenerate enough coins (or drops) every couple of hours to make it worthwhile.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids love it. My kids had been begging me for this game for months. Now they do their homework and chores without fights. So they can play this game.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Good read, great subject matter and it doesn't hurt that he is honest about his situations and feelings. Looking forward to reading his other book. Heart goes out to his widow and children.
0811879542|5.0|I love this book so much.  I first learned about it at our local storytime.  Both my kids love it but it is perfect for 3 and 4 year olds.  They love to &#34;press&#34; the spots in the book.  It's a very clever idea and very well done.  And you'll want to do it over and over.  It's also great for learning colors for the little ones.
B00919V32K|4.0|There is a lot to like here musically. The arrangements feature excellent horns and some nice guitar playing. This is mostly jazz but with some rock guitar added. Vocals are always used as a source of comedy. Stairway to Heaven is sung seriously even if it is given a reggae beat. A Few Moments with Brother A West is a very funny bit of religious rebuke aimed at Zappa.
B0091QS88K|1.0|Not well conceived and confusing to operate for my 31/2 year old child. She loves the original Dr. Panda because of the way it's laid out and easy to navigate.
1594203334|5.0|The truth is... this is now a highly useful book for French mothers as well !<br /><br />I read it last summer when I was pregnant  with my first child (at age 39) and it has become my favorite gift for (French )pregnant friends since the French edition came out last spring (and they loved it as much as I did !)<br /><br />I learnt a lot about my own country and its (traditionnal) (and vanishing) parenting style through the eyes of an \\"outsider\\" : you don't see what is too familiar to you... (or she can see it differently)<br /><br />and on the practical side it saved me a LOT of touble as a new mum !!<br />(my daugther \\"did her nigths\\" when she was 2 weeks and a half, but it also has to do with good sleeping genes in my family :-)<br /><br />Actually, many young French parents have turned quite \\"American\\" lately (attachment parenting has become quite fashionable here under the name of \\"maternage proximal\\") and now \\"overparenting\\" isn't something rare here either ...<br />One of my friends told me that she actually felt a lot closer to the American mothers described in the book in the way she raised her daugther (and she was not sure it was a good thing...)<br /><br />Fun and very well documented !
B0058YPL66|5.0|I got this for my Sister as well. Fast service,awesome quality,great packaging! A must have for any fan made her day:)
B009AY04A8|3.0|A interesting game, with to much dialog. It is fun finding the objects and if it had less dialog I might rate it 4 stars.
B0050UEVNM|2.0|So this movie is generally rambling and at a loss for a cohesive, interesting theme.Throw in some mid-20's drinking/partying angst and faux drama between Angelina and Jon Stewart (who should stick to mediocre 'news' schtick) and you've got this movie and any random pic of unnamed others without the star power behind it. Unfortunately other than the painfully short, yet poignant, interaction between Connery and Rowlands, then Burstyn's touching scenes reconnecting with her gay son (who of course in 1998 is dying of AIDS) the remainder of the movie was one rehashed-mish-mashed scene from any other &#34;young couple conquering modern-day demons that try to pull them apart &#34; film. Unfortunately, it doesn't have too much in the way of feel-good moments. With the exception of Mr. Connery, Ms. Rowlands, and Ms. Burstyn's scenes the film isn't worth the plastic it's printed on.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Does what it says it does.  Just popped it on my TV and away I went. Use it every day.
B009RX85N0|5.0|awesome collection provides hours of entertainment. Cant wait for the next season to come out! Very happy customer with collection,shipping,and fast delivery.
B00770KR7W|5.0|Perfect addition to my sons halo collection. He managed to break the little button that held the gun to his back but he doesn't seem to mind (and he always finds a way to break something). The rest of the toy is very sturdy.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|This is one of the best western movies of all times. Lee Marvin was perfect for the part. Anyone that<br />likes western movies I truly recommend this one.
B00ALCBTWU|1.0|Very little plot but lots of gunfire and blood spurts. I'd guess half the budget was spent on stage blood and squibs. Anyone with an ounce of sense knows that the Nazis neither had an atomic bomb nor an actual atomic bomb program aside from Heisenberg's calculations. Given that, a Nazi a-bomb might make a good plot but this isn't it. By a long shot! And to use a Fritz X guided bomb as the atomic weapon was even more ludicrous. On top of a V-2, maybe, but not a small guided anti-ship weapon. It's too bad nobody on this project had any concept of this thing called \\"research.\\" Rent it on Netflix and if you can stay awake, you'e doing good. Doubt you'd watch it again.
B00B7XGFO4|3.0|It was very good but I have watched other Jane Eyre's that had more detail. So compared to the other one I saw this one is okay.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Overall, device performed as stated. Would like the ability to cast personal videos. Looking forward to more compatible apps and functions.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun and challenging game. Easy download, price was right and I can now play the game any where at any time.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I find this site has more info than others I've tried.  I really like no<br />t only forecast but precious %, wind speed etc.
B0061S0A64|5.0|When I bought this, I wasn't'sure what to expect.turns out I enjoy it very much.l play to relieve stress.my grandchildren think it is great.we need more apps like this.
0525953728|5.0|I loved the book.  I think it was well written and full of suspense.  These brave men<br />can't be named as their organization has to be secret.  They went to such extreme<br />danger, bringing down bin Laden.  Superior job, men!!  Thank you!!!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Personal and legal dynamics intersect to make this show a compelling series that keeps me waiting for the next plot twist.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|All I wanted was a cheap Netflix device and this met the bill. It will only get better from this initial deployment.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I have enjoyed reading this. It does not gloss over the negative aspects of his personality nor does it depict him as a demigod. The things he got right and the things he failed at are both highlighted, in his pursuit of quality.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was having so much fun..but I did have to go go  cheat page because I was stuck.  I was sad when it ended.  Highly recommend this game!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Game plays fine and my kid loves it, got to admit so do I. it brings me back to my younger days.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Action packed and suspense filled! If you like cop shows this is the show to watch! Wish there was more!
B008602KQI|4.0|Great movie.  Has some good themes and lessons.  Plent of action and good acting.  Leaves you ready for the sequel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|minions to extreme!  keeps you wanting to keep playing! unlike other games no waiting for lives, just keep going.... or until your battery dies
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is full of blocks! You also fight monsters to survive I'm 9 and a half and I love this game!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Currently, my only objection is really the amount of content I have access too.  There was some software glitches when it first came out but with the first patch, I think they all disappeared.  I expect Google to continue to improve this device and can't wait to see future enhancements.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|I love this movie and it still brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it.  I lost a daughter 13 years ago in an auto accident and I remember her and I watching this movie together.  It was one of her favorites.  I know she still sits and watches this with me.
B000C13Y2S|1.0|It's the cutest li'l thing. My loves it. We have the larger sizes - big and bigger. But this little one is just right for the purse. And yes, the legs are as functional and the head movement is the same as the big ones.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's really fun and has lots of different challenges for you to do and new areas for you to discover
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I loved it when I first started watching, and I still go back even after 7 seasons. I've even explored the classic episodes of this show. Warning: watching this could get you immensely addicted to Doctor Who. Definitely a great way to introduce Doctor Who to a new generation of viewers
B000VOC90Y|4.0|It's a great backpack that's very spacious and quite well made. However, it won't fit all 17in notebooks. Albeit mine is abnormally large. Don't get it for a gaming laptop like an Asus g750
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I bought this book because of the controversy initiated by a reporter that challenged the author's religious beliefs and qualifications to write about Jesus.  I feel the reporter was completely out of line and was prompted to start a fight.  The reporter was nothing more than a bully.  In fact, she should not be given the title &#34;Reporter.&#34;  However, the author held his ground and clearly demonstrated, on numerous occasions, that his religious and educational backgrounds more than qualified him to research the topic and write on same.<br />I am a 63 year old Catholic male and this author opened my eyes to the raw, political, and harsh environment that Jesus lived in.  The author presented facts that removed the 'sugar coating' view of the life and times of Jesus and his followers.  The author challenged century old beliefs with pragmatic and real life settings that made one think that 'reported' events, per the Bible and other scholarly writings may not have been as written.  This book did not change my view of the life and death and times of Jesus or his followers.  Quite the contrary, it renewed my faith in them and made me realize that Jesus was tough, living in a tough environment, surrounded by death, deceit, and corruption and still managed to capture the meaning of speaking out for what he believed in while not compromising his values.  I recommend this book for all to read, especially baby boomer Catholics like myself that have seen the Catholic Church evolve from strict rules of compliance to what we have today...
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|I downloaded it before reading the reviews and now I wish I hadn't.  It looks like a decent app, except that it wants far too many permissions than is needed.  I'll keep looking for a nice simple notepaper replacement.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Hi this app is great thanks for marking it it so much fun it really is please mAke more like this and thanks
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Reza's work reads easily (unless you find the thesis offensive, I'd guess) and I burned through the kindle version in a remarkably short time. Being new to the kindle, I've probably missed a setting somewhere that allows me to see the number of pages, but for a topic of such complexity, I'd have like a more extensive treatment.  Whether member of the faithful will find enough caveats with regard to Christology to comfort him or her is doubtful, though such caveats are in the text.<br /><br />Whatever point of view you bring to the reading, you're quite likely to have it effectively challenged by Aslan's clear and thoughtful prose. You'll have to search far and wide to find another treatment of what the historical Jesus of Nazareth may have been like. I enjoyed the read and plan to go over it again more slowly this time...<br /><br />-Dave Gregoire
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is without a doubt, the best book I've ever read.<br />Make me proud to be an American.  God bless the U.S.A.
1452101248|5.0|I've always been a huge fan of this chef so I shouldn't be surprised that his vegetarian cook book is as amazing or better than his previous books. He's the veggy master!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Great game. Airtime is the best! Very addictive. Steal your time so watch out. Love it. Nice upgrades. Install it on all of your devices. Fun little off road joy ride.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Visually striking, good sound and effects. My son loved it and immediately recognized it as a Jack and the Beanstalk spinoff even though the plot has changed for theatre.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Lots of action and makes you think and rethink to the very end.  Tom Cruise always been a hottie but kinda looking old now
0345803485|3.0|There are already sooo many reviews for this book, but just wanted to give my two cents. James is definitely breaking a taboo by introducing BDSM in this book but unfortunately the characters are just kind of annoying. Although, Christian Grey does indeed seem like quite the hunk. The story is just too much though. I do give her kudos for spurring a huge debate! I read it out of curiosity because of the hype and seems that many others are too, that must count for something. Overall, could have been better written.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Pretty funny book, love the ending, at the end everything will be okay and we do over dramatize life's choices.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Not quite as good as Avatar (comparison that has been made). Visually stunning. The subject matter is more thoughtful than Avatar, and younger kids will probably get bored. My 10 year old granddaughter did like it.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Just the right amount of difficulty. Not too easy and not extremely hard. I look forward to playing more levels.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Found out my router was on same channel as my neighbors direct tv.<br />Changed channel and I have better wifi range and speed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For $35 this is the best value O have come across all year. It is mobile and easy to use. Great product. With all the new technology available today I will be cutting my cable TV cord in November when my contract expires and will never turn back. Thank you for a great and inexpensive tool Google.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Great series.  my son loves to read and he love this series.  now that he has a Kindle he reads even more.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Great fun with the family!!! Kids stayed occupied by finding the hidden clues that you have to open etc. to find! Highly recommend!
B005C6HGSG|5.0|I read this in Bobby's voice the entire way through. Absolutely amazing read! Was imagining this story as an episode!! Seriously loved this book!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good app if you like horses. It shows the element of taking care of a house as well as adding fun to it. You can train, feed, and compete with your horse. It's realistic and the graphics are really good! For a free app, it's quite good. I would recommend getting it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Have youtube and netflix on my tv but this loads in a 1/4 of the time. Plus control with your phone or laptop is sweet.
B00CJGP116|5.0|I followed Marc's career from the beginning, I have every one of his albums, I listen to daily.<br /><br />Each new production is eagerly awaited by me.<br /><br />It's a great singer.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|its just like the old days only better! upgrades and repairs ability just makes the game as a whole so much more interesting
B0089LOG02|5.0|I just finished reading the Orphan Train: A Novel. I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed the friendship/love that developed between the characters.<br />The story is full of history and has prompted me to buy more books about the orphan trains to learn more. I enjoyed this story because of the relationships that were so well described by the author, it made me feel like I knew the characters at the end of the book.<br />While the story is not specifically about foster care , I think it tells the truth about children in foster care, there are some great foster homes, and some horrible foster homes. I work with teens and could relate to the thoughts and feelings of Molly and Vivian, even though Vivian was \\"in the system\\" many years ago, her feelings were no different than those of children today. It would be a great day if all foster children were safe and loved.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|We played this game with 4 adults and our niece (5) and nephew (8).<br />The adults got the colors = Better or worse odds, as did the older kid.<br />The younger just loved rolling the dice.<br /><br />They all loved the game so much, we gave it as a birthday present with a bag of brain erasers to use as counters!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|my account is showing $0 I only purchased the trilogy and safe haven ..I should have @ least $30 left .Please show me my purchases. thank you.
B00ANAC32U|4.0|This is the nicest designed bumper i have ever used. The only problem is that it makes the phone very wide. I think the naked Nexus 4 is perfect but I dint want to spend $170 on a new glass so I deal with it. It is stylish and everything is accesible. I did have a problem with a bulky headphone plug, but otherwise no issues.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|It is a classic I could not get into.  I know that is really bad to say - but I did not read the whole thing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't get enough of it and went to Amazon plus just to watch season three because I couldn't get it any other way. Thank you Amazon plus.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooo good it's amazing with cool power-ups, funny characters and nice motherboards. This is one of the best games ever
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Supreme actors, such an unusual setting, an amazing story line.  Young or old, we are all just looking for a place 5o feel loved and needed....I have watched this over and over.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|The story line was good, however, the movie was slow.  So slow that my husband fell asleep.  Enjoyed the music. All in all, a bit of a disappointment.  I expected so much more with such a good cast.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|For what it presents itself to be, it achieves.  However, a few things are missing.  I cannot find a setup or options menu, so I cannot mute the game unless I mute my entire phone or switch difficulties.
B00C061I3K|5.0|kill me this album is amazing, every song makes me fell immortal and please reduce the numbers of words in the calification
3836538725|5.0|Purchased the book after going to one of his gallery shows in Santa Monica.<br />Book of course was overpriced so I considered looking on Amazon and of course its at a more reasonable price.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|this app drains the battery even when its not open... if you have an alarm set it takes over 15 hours to get a full charge, I uninstalled it because I need to use my kindle during the day and I cant have it plugged in all the time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's very addicting and loads of fun. Love how it  stimulates the mind in so may ways. Can't wait for more rooms!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love a mystery and this reminds me of when I was a kid playing clue....it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun....
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It happens all the time. You stumble accrost a good youtube video and you weight the pros and cons of setting it up on your computer vs just watching it on your tiny screen with subpar speakers. Well, things just got a whole lot easier. Now when you bring up a youtube video on your phone the only thing that will stop you from bringing it up on your tv will be if you are too lazy to walk to the room with the tv in it. Also, it's great for parties.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was gripping and an easy read. I couldn't put it down! I am looking forward to the next one.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very good game wish their was more to the game, maybe better upgrades. I have not come along any glitches so far and I hope I don't I would hate too have to erase this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Our toddler loves this game!  Great fun for everyone!  Highly suggest to anyone with kids or the kid at heart.  Very addictive.
B009AY04A8|4.0|The app is a lot of fun with one exception,too much reading. If there was audio it would move more smoothly.  But for the price it was worth it.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|I felt the story too long and slow. Plot was not very well knitted. There seems to be sort of discontinuity in the plot. It started off well but became boring in the middle until the end when the duo- brother and sister are again brought together . I found this not as interesting as the earlier one, A thousand splendid suns. Still one can read without expecting much.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|I studied history in High School but this novel brought the history to life. Thank you Ken Follett.<br />I look forward to entering another of your worlds soon.
B0047T86G0|4.0|I really like this dictionary I got for my Kindle for PC app. It makes reading a lot easier, especially since what I've been reading has been textbooks with some complicated words. I can just click on a word and the definition pops up in a little window above the cursor. The definitions are easy for me to understand, too.<br /><br />My only complaint is that you can't search it for words unless it's on a page right in front of you on a Kindle. But I guess that's what Google is for.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|It was the most twisted love story.  Unrequited love taken too far.  But it kept my interest.  There was plenty of suspense.  The development of the boys characters was also very good.  The 2 young actors were real stars!
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|Great plot with many twists. Fantastic team of characters. This will keep your attention! Penn, Brolin, Gosling, Ribisi, etc. Awesome performances by the cast.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Enjoy playing and the fact it was free! Makes this game even better got my husband playing the game as well.
B000IVW25M|1.0|The quality of the platinum DVD is unbelievably horrible,<br />Even the interview at the end is lousy.<br />I was not allowed to return it because the vendor does not stand behind the products they sell<br />Sold by cddvdgamewarehouse<br />Very disappointed in their return policy<br />Buyers beware
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun game until it forces a written review in order to continue playing the free version... a rather un cool feature. However I am enjoying the game and wish to continue for free so therefore I will rate the game as fun and provokes a little thought at times.
B009AY04A8|2.0|The game is what it is, a hidden object game with ok side quests.<br /><br />However, the developer finds it necessary to spam the user with Rate Our Game messages. Either I have the game because I paid for it or it was AOTD on Yahoo. Either way, leave your beggary for the free versions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an awesome game but I think that unlocking people should coast  only money not buying mystery boxes
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|This was a awesome movie.  Which I had seen in the movies three D.  But this was the first move we watched on our new smartTV
B000002GK1|5.0|A monstrous production from start to finish, Soundgarden's `Badmotorfinger' hit the market place just as grunge was exploding into the mainstream. Though it was only their third LP, the Seattle band were already showing a mastery of many hard rock styles and also turned in their best sounding record to date as well. Lead single \\"Outshined\\" seemed to allow the band to revel in all their influences - Sabbath, Zeppelin, etc. - but at the same time brought freshness to what could have been a rehash of older styles. \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\", \\"Rusty Cage\\", \\"Mind Riot\\" and the truly visionary and complex \\"Searching with My Good Eye Closed\\" are all outstanding cuts on a record in which there really are no weaknesses. Ben Sheppard had joined the band to complete Soundgarden's most important lineup as Sheppard was able to bring strong musicianship and composing talents to augment an already formidable skill set that SG already possessed in spades.  Chris Cornell sounds like he believes he will spontaneously combust if he doesn't deliver his lyrics in the exact paint peeling manner in which they are delivered in what could be the greatest performance of a rock vocalist in the modern era. `Badmotorfinger' was a major breakthrough with airplay on rock radio and MTV and this would pave the way for their mammoth success by the mid `90s.  Feeling Minnesota would come to symbolize the resounding popularity of grunge and with Soundgarden; the metal quotient of the movement in its supreme incarnation.
B00EB6ENXO|3.0|Pros:<br />  - More Iron Man Action. More Iron man in more scenarios. that's what we wont. WWSD?<br />  - He starts behaving like Tony stark should. He can't shake his own agency or the value of human lives. He cannot reenter his fantasy/escape.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - Potential:<br />  + Extremis was Tony's first step into trans-humanism. He would now have a stronger, faster body and be able to rebuild his suit on-the-fly while storing the entire thing in the hallows of his bones via nanites. Instead, Tony never even uses them. Extremis is used as nothing more than a monster maker. a magic potion with little explanation. Just another excuse to bring another simple-minded bad-guy into the movie for tony to fight.<br />  + The villain was supposed to be one of earth's most powerful sorcerers. An Extremis-modified super human with the ability to reshape his armer and being to build tech in ways that only he can, fighting Marvel Studio's first, real sorcerer. Pure tech vs pure magic. There are no rules for this kind of battle on film. That would have been both risky and interesting. Iron Man 3 was fun, not interesting, but fun.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is so fun.  It's easier than the 80's version as you don't have to scroll a ball. I've just started but we will see how hard it gets. This review will net me 50 points so I'm a bit influenced though I do like it.  Great little time passing app.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was an interesting book. Lots of twists and turns. Just don't like the ending if you can call that an ending. But I guess that leaves the option to write more.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|I loved the beginning seeing Grandpa Jack with little toddler Teri...and seeing Kim and Steve.<br /><br />The story is typical 24 excitement and suspense.  I love Chloe in this and thrilled to see her get a serious role.<br /><br />I loved seeing Katee Sackhoff in this, too.  Too bad it was as a bad girl LOL.<br /><br />I have watched all eight seasons several times and became attached to recurring characters and really sad to see one killed off.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to Season 9.

0385342071|5.0|I've read many of Sophie Kinsella's books and not all were as captivating as this one. So, this is a definite recomendation for an intense, humorous, sweet romantic beach (or evening) read. You won't be able to put it down until you've read the last page.<br /><br />I loved the sweetness and innocence Poppy portrays. She has put herself in so many awkward situations that I was literally holding my breath at the sheer size of her mess-ups. But all in all the intuitive, smart, a bit self-conscious, but always well-meaning phisiotherapist manages to slip out of awkward situations like cat, eventually ending up solving a vicious plot to ruin Sam's company. And Sam... oh, at first I felt quite some annoyance toward him, especially because of his snorty way of communicating. But soon it became clear that beneath the unfaltering surface lies a soft, caring, honest man, who slowly developes deep feelings for Poppy. It's so beautiful to see these two falling into each other ever so slowly whilst overcomming many ups and downs on the way. Loved this novel!(I would never rate a book with 5 stars if I didn't absolutely love it!)<br /><br />Hope you will enjoy it as much as I have!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Just some advice... Google pushed an update today to disable the Chromecast's ability to stream media from your local devices.<br /><br />Now, the only reason I wanted the device was to project slideshows of my vacation pictures to my TV, it seems that I'll have to go back to using that wonderful 50' HDMI cable I bought from Amazon Basics.<br /><br />Once again, the DRM crowd is spoiling things assuming the only possible open source uses are piracy.<br /><br />I was also hoping this device would allow 85 year old Aunt Delores, who suffers from macular degeneration to port the signal from her notebook to her TV.  Apparently that also is not a good use per the DRM crowd.<br /><br />\\"Do no EVIL\\"... Yeah, Right.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|Ok game. Better than most on the kindle store. The game is easy after you upgrade your stuff. Have not played enough to tell if it is worth spending a dollar. I got it free
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a fun app for anyone who loves despicable me!!!! But, Until the update it no longer was fun and became more of a headache to just get the app open. Currently the app Now freezes, gets stuck on one screen, and wont work properly. If possible Avoid doing the update and just leave the app at its original state. Because if you do install the update you might run into future Issues.<br />-Christine<br />P.s: Good Luck with the App
B002ZG999U|4.0|I Saw Expendables 2 before I saw #1 which was a disappointment<br />Had I saw this movie first I would not have bought Expendables 2 which would have been tragic as it was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />As for the seller I got my product as described and Delivery was fast no complaints here.<br />I will recommend this seller to everyone.<br /><br />I do not think this movie should get 4 stars but I submitted It with 3 and Amazon told me I had to change it. I read all the guidelines and tips I had no profane language , more than 20 words, I should be on the product I purchased which was a terrible movie, I said  I got as described a very good Dvd disk and case at a very good Price I will buy from this seller again and I would recommend the seller to others, BUT the Movie sucked and I should not have to give it 5 Stars to get this comment post here.<br />If they don't like this one then I just will not leave any feed back ever again.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I would have to say this is my absolute favorite Foreign film. It's touching and funny, and altogether heart-warming. I recommend it!!
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|By Theresa Dery - Yipee Ky yay! Sure this movie has all the explosions and impossible human feats that we have come to love in the 'Die Hard' series. But thankfully, it also has the great dialogue and quips we so enjoy. Bruce Willis is as cool as ever (even improved with age!)and his 'son' lived up to the McClane legacy. I can't wait for the next 'Die Hard' movie!

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I loved the idea of chromecast being able to stream videos from any android device to a television. Unfortunately you cant actually stream videos from your OWN gallery. Lucky an app called Allcast actually lets me stream my own videos to chromecast; unfortunately Google now block that app and now they've restricted me from sharing my own videos. Why? If my family comes over I can't show them videos of my kids on the television. Why?

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Oh my gosh, I LOVED this book!  I had seen the high reviews and read the description of the story, but it just didn't sound interesting enough for me to download.  I've been burned a few times lately by the Amazon \\"Bandwagon\\" ratings being higher than they should, so I was planning to avoid this book.  But then a friend of mine recommended it - one of the few friends who thinks for herself and whose literary opinions seem to be very similar to my own.<br /><br />It did take a little time to develop into the story line that had me so thoroughly enthralled, but it really didn't take too long and was so incredibly worth it once it got interesting.  I think part of the slightly slow start was the very thorough characters that Grissom developed.  Each one had a distinct personality and position within the family.<br /><br />This book was gripping, the story was one of longing and sadness and terrible mistreatment, but it also had moments of joy and true love and heroic gestures.  I smiled (albeit, not very much) and I cried and I felt so amazingly involved in this story.  I liked the new take on one of the old stories of 18th century slavery and how she was able to make it feel so real for a little white girl to get adopted and entwined into their generations-long \\"family\\" of servants.<br /><br />The only negative comment I have is that the story is very tragic.  I know some people are sensitive to read novels that have so much sadness, but I feel like the author did try to be as true as possible to plantation life and slaver - and unfortunately, I don't believe many of those real stories progressed or ended in much happiness.  I, however, could read this over and over again, even though at many points in the story, I felt so genuinely heartbroken for the characters.<br />But the time I felt most mournful was when it ended.  I wish it were twice as long!

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was my first Neil Gaiman book and I really had no idea what to expect.  I was completely drawn into this story from the very beginning.  I had seen it described as an \\"adult fairy tale\\", but I truly wasn't sure what that meant.  I really didn't even understand while I was reading it, but now that it's over, I do see the fairy-tale concepts that were delivered.<br /><br />I didn't quite love the last 30% or so of the story.  It got...weird...?  That's obviously too light of a word, but the oddity of the story line as it progressed and came to its climax was a little too out there for me.  I felt that I lost a little bit of captivation during the big \\"battle\\" with Ursula that felt a tad forced.  But, it ended very well and I was absorbed in the entire (very short) book.<br /><br />The Hempstocks had me smiling and (small spoiler) when his kitten died unceremoniously, I was irrationally crying.  This was such an odd little novel - but it was very enjoyable.<br /><br />I was engrossed in this story and loved the themes of innocence and morality.  Highly recommend reading this.  If you hate it, it will really only cost you a couple of hours of your life since it's so short.  I do look forward to trying out another one of Gaiman's books!
B0045NDVFE|5.0|It is really awesome enjoyed listening to it very much may be looking at more in the future thank You
140006922X|4.0|The book is a great read. So, all that follows is written with this opinion. The book is described as -more or less- a historical look into the historical person that was Jesus, not into the Jesus \\"The Christ\\" as if there were a way to separate the two somehow. However, as you read the book, time and time and time again, Aslan seems to have the agenda of using what little \\"historical\\" evidence there is about Jesus the person AGAINST what is commonly accepted as Jesus The Christ.<br /><br />In doing so, my take on the book is that Aslan intentionally tries to be offensive at times in the way he reaches his conclusions. So, if you're Christian, which most of you probably are, be prepared to feel like someone is almost making fun of Jesus in several places. It is not that Aslan's conclusions themselves are not realistic or even probable if the history he writes about is true, but it's the language he chose to use that was unnecessary in making those points.<br /><br />He discounts several well known stories in the new Testament. For instance, Jesus wasn't born in Bethlehem. He didn't preach the scriptures at a young age. Mary was not a virgin. Pontius Pilate was not involved with the crucifixion. Jesus and his disciples did not conceptualize Jesus as the son of God, etc. When historical \\"evidence\\" is weighed with politics, Jewish law, revolution and Roman occupation of Palestine, and class structure of the time, Aslan provides alternative views and reasons why things were written differently than they occurred. But, again, it's the language itself that will upset people, not the alternative views themselves.<br /><br />According to this book, there was no library, school, or synagogue in Nazareth so Jesus couldn't have been able to read.  Therefore he couldn't have preached at a young age. But, it was accepted that he preached at an older age. The lack of formal means by which he could have learned later were never called into question. Can you have it both ways? And,if you believe that Jesus the person was Jesus the Christ, could not he have had these abilities in the same way he could given others sight? There is much that Jesus does that was clearly \\"supernatural\\" that he is given credit for. So, why then is he an \\"uneducated illiterate peasant day laborer\\" when making the point at other times?<br /><br />It's a good read. If NOTHING else, it was a really great history lesson of the times and some great discussion points on much of what we know to be true. But, I could have heard all that and reached the same conclusions without feeling as if Jesus was being put down and insulted.<br /><br />MMM
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|A love story like no other.  Loyalty and family at its trying times. Accidents, forgiveness, sacrifices and allot of true reality that sometimes you have to make some difficult decisions.
B006QVRVJK|5.0|Such a good ensemble cast film. totally absurd and out of the ordinary. You have to be open to the ridiculous premise and situations that arise or at least keep in mind that it is meant to be absurd (to the filmmakers and actors, not to the characters - the characters think it is perfectly normal and it's totally believable that they do). Loved this movie when I saw it in theaters and I'm glad I bought it.
B005COO1X6|1.0|I've been reading Stephen King forever and always love his stuff. I knew this was a short story when I purchased it. I didn't care it was $2.99 for about 60 pages. It started out good but the ending just ruins the book. There is absolutely no explanation to anything in this book. You are just left hanging. He should have added a few pages to give the reader some sort of satisfaction. Really disappointed in Stephen King.

B0032UYFA6|3.0|My opinion, was the really only ground-breaking season of Breaking Bad Heralded as the best show on TV right now (it most likely is, due to brain-numbing, reality-TV, shoot me in the head, shows like 'The Kardashians' and many others of the same. And I would agree that It is the best show on TV right now, but nothing can compare to the first season.<br /><br />The third season was good.  It had a very great, edge of your seat, season finale.  The writing and acting just isn't as good as the first season.  The funny moments--like Walt driving down a road with two dead bodies in the back of his RV, while only in his underwear bordered on dark-humor and extreme suspense.  I loved the episode when Walt decides to kill the other drug dealer, which was actually an informant (crazy 8).  Jesse was so funny and showed great acting quality (which he still does) in most moments of season 1.<br /><br />Season 3 is melodramatic, sub-par writing, and has lost its suspense and what made season 1 so good.  I will stick around for the series, but i was severely disappointed with Season 2, Season 3 kicked it up a notch--lets hope they get a good finale in for the series.  Sometimes I find myself bored as Walt and his wife fight, the stupid sub-plots with Marie and Hank/do they know about Walt/do they not know? plays on and on.  Its just not as good.  That's my opinion, you are welcome to your own, the show's quality in some respects has gotten better but mostly, gone downhill.  It still does have its saving graces, which is why i will continue to watch, just not worthy of the buy.
B007W4OZ76|2.0|Not sure what it's  supposed to do, but I read I needed it with dropbox. A little information would be really nice.

B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|As with the Star Trek the Motion Picture Soundtrack, composer Michael Giacchino has fun with the composition with the music for the new movie and at the same time brings so much emotion into his music. Despite there being similarities between this soundtrack and the original, such as the Theme that was overused in the first, this has to be the better of the two soundtracks. Some of the most original themes on this soundtrack is \\"The Kronos Wartet and London Calling\\" which I enjoyed immensely. However, the whole CD is a must have for the music lover and the collector of all things Star Trek!

1401235425|5.0|This is the first piece of Snyder's work I've read. With the reboot, new threat to Batman and new writer I was skeptic. We are all too comfortable and just want the usual rogues for Batman. Yet Snyder says no, breaks the mold with a new threat and it works. It is ballsy he did it and he pulled it off. Talon has such a cool luck and can give Bats a good fight. Capullo's art is great, especially when Bats gets lost in the maze, the combination of art and narrative just makes a great comic. After reading this I think years from now we will be discussing Snyder.

B009RH9J7W|5.0|I found that Marware genuine standing case was light weight and very easy to handle. It came with a band that help to secure my kindle and the kindle locks into place with no slipping or movement that can endanger your kindle through falling out of the case. There is two ways to display the kindle in the stand: (1) long way and straight up and down with three locking positions. This is a good buy for your money and for security of your kindle, so I highly recommend.
B005HSL626|5.0|Best game ever however I suck at playing it. Always works. wish there were more level options.  Very fun though.

B00005JKBC|5.0|Such a great story line...really keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout!  I had seen it years ago and decided I wanted to have it in my personal library!  So glad I found it and, so reasonably priced as well!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A good game to get your mind off of things but be careful if you let the little ones play, make sure the parental lock is on or you will be billed for fictitious items.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|Any product that gets you off the couch and tracking your progress has to be a good thing, right?  The Pulse does as advertised and is indeed compact.  I find the solution a bit lacking as one needs to have the unit, belt clip, night strap and charging cable handy if you're travelling or spending the night at beds other than your own.  So, four components are required.  Solutions that are a true all-in-one (Nike Fuelband) are slicker and easier to manage in my opinion.  Word is that Nike will release a FuelBand 2 next month featuring Bluetooth 4.0, a heart rate monitor and third-party apps.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A really good game which tests your memory and moves you to the next room for another challenge. A pen and paper is needed though to write down some of the codes!
B00AEBB9EG|5.0|Had seen this movie many years ago and remembered how much I enjoyed it so, when it popped up while search another film, I decided to add it to my personal library.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The setup was a complete breeze and my wife and I use it daily. We mostly use it for Netflix, but I'm eager to see what apps are developed in the future.<br /><br />When the device is not in use, it displays its name, the time and date and a photo slideshow that advances every five minutes or so. It looks really nice, and if you forget to turn your TV off after casting something, it's one of the less horrible things to have displayed in your living room.<br /><br />There's a slight amount of fumbling involved. When you cast the first Netflix episode after waking the device up, you can't lock your phone until the Netflix app on the Chromecast is up and running. When you cast Youtube from a Chrome browser, there's a bit of confusion if you close the tab and can't remember that the chromecast button is in the toolbar.<br /><br />This device is small, pretty, slightly denser than you'd expect. The packaging is Apple-esque and includes the Chromecast, a USB charging cable, a USB/wall outlet adapter and a half inch HDMI extender.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is an intelligent, fast moving, you're hooked kind of show!  It's similar to reading a novel of your favorite author; you can't turn the pages fast enough and by the time you're finished you're sad because you can't be part of their lives anymore.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book follows the track set down by Name of the Wind perfectly. Kvothe is one of the best characters out there.

B00AUA67GQ|3.0|I generally like the response, but there's a glitch: the program confuses the dot of an i as the end of the last word written.  Unless I delete the dot, the next word begins at the i and not at the end of the word that contains the i.
6305744793|1.0|This DVD was poorly recorded. The movie was cut and reduced in length. I feel like returning it, it was hard to hear audio. But the music was blasting! Very bad.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much better than candy crush! And more addictive too. Definitely worth the price of FREE! I recommend this game to kids of all ages
B00BOXZAJ8|1.0|This was such a disappointment- even the love story was lame but the plot is non existent! Whoever compared this to Romeo and Juliet never read the play.
B0032BMSXQ|4.0|I like the material and comfort. Padding is great. Wore it on a 100 mile ride. A bit smaller than expected but ok. I'm 6 ft 190 and got an XL.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Knowing JK Rowling wrote this, I think I had very high expectations.  It is an engaging story and the writing is in her usual fluid style.  Many of the characterizations were full and well drawn, especially the young people.  I found the adults less well limned and occasionally had to back track or retrace in my head who was who.
B003QP2TW8|1.0|Unfortunately this Blu ray is coded for Region 2 (Europe) and cannot be played on US machines without an adaptor.

B008B3MZNI|5.0|I always loved the Live in Paris CDs, which I have for over 20 years and just could not believe when I saw that this was released on Blu-Ray, bought it immediately and I gotta tell you: This is waaaay better than I expected, very good quality sound and picture (don't forget, it's from 1979), and the performance is just fantastic, Roger Hodgson plays the lead and rytthm guitar, plays the piano, sings, it's just amazing. Rick Davies is great as well, the whole thing is great. One particularly good surprise is the song Child of Vision, which is not on the CD version and is pure magic. This has earned a place in my top 10 favorite concerts on video, which includes Pink Floyd: Pulse (#1, no band can beat it);  David Gilmour: Live in Gdansk; Fleetwood Mac: The Dance; Dire Straits: On the Night; Eric Clapton: 24 nights; John Mayer: Where the Light Is, and Bee Gees: One Night Only.<br /><br />Order yours now, it's worth every penny.
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|I am a big fan of this band.  Thought I couldn't love them any more till I started listening to this.  Amazing!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|it is fun and interesting.  And makes you think.<br />We play it with the kids and they think it is fun too.
B009LDD22U|4.0|I own the previous seasons. This show is hilarious and the bonus material is good enough. But this season was quite disappointing. had a good few episodes though. I'm not saying it was bad, I'm just used to the high quality level that this show was gotten me used to.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the season and you are a fan of the show then get the season in BRD or DVD. if you have seen it, the only reason to own it is because you want to add it to your collection.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Fun for old folks and preteens. Simple but engaging. I like solving simple problems.<br />Glad this was free today.  Will keep checking for free games.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|When r u goin 2 bring the actual game 2 the kindle?<br />come on...<br />COME ON!<br />facebook even has it
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. I seriously couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the movie. What a HERO!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! Not to easy but not so difficult that you just give up and move on. Need more levels though!
B003TOMAPC|5.0|This is and incredible and hilarious origin story about a corky and funny &#34;superhero&#34;. I highly recommend this blu-ray and this movie.
B000IDEORY|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time!!! I can watch it over and over. It never gets old for me lol
B00DBQ0AV4|5.0|Just got this Deluxe edition last Saturday. I straight listened to all tracks, and of course this CD is worth getting 5 stars, even more. First, Netrebko voice quality and maturity reach the culmination here. This CD has a 'quantum leap' progression, which contains: drama, humor, musicality, pronunciation, and all details. This recording also owed very much to the meticulously accompaniment from Gianandrea Noseda and his Orchestra Teatro Regio Torino, so we would enjoy this CD to the fullest. And thanks also to the thick booklet and also DVD bonus. Her voice is simply stunning!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun and i enjoy playing this game alot im 12 and i think this game is fun and apropriet for any age
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I really like having extra cables for my electronic devices, this one I can use for recharging several of them
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It took a few times to get into the book, but once I really set aside some time to read, I really got into it. I liked the twists at the end and I really fell in love with the characters.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I tried it on several bottles and it scored it but didn't cut them. Gave it to an art teacher to try and she had no success either so unfortunately I had to return it. Customer service made many suggestions but to no avail. Not recommeded.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|I LOVE this story; it's a timeless classic which attempts to answer the following question: What makes a monster and what makes a man? Wilde goes above and beyond, exploring every facet of the human psyche with three men: Basil, Lord Henry, and Dorian, himself. A wonderfully repressed story of homoerotic love for the Victorian age, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fantastic read for summer. So, pour yourself a drink, sit back, and delve into the darkest corners of human depravity.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I have now read four of this authors' books and all of them have motivated me to read more.  This love story was unpredictable at first and intriguing.  Louisa is the most engaging character, strong, funny, quirky and brutally honest.  I got to a point around half way into the story and found it almost impossible to put the book down.  There was a sense of a deep love unfolding but I was unprepared for the outcome.
B0015LBYMQ|5.0|Sometimes it all comes together for an artist and they do something they may never achieve again, This is that something and John might never best this record. I bought this years ago on CD and then I have had it on my iPhone forever and iPod before that. It never gets old. Recently I got back into LP records after many decades of never having them around. So I thought to get it on vinyl and i have fell in love with it all over again. The new pressings are state of the art this sounds amazing, I cannot recommend this enough. Get it on vinyl !
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Had to purchase this episode because it was set in a small town near where I live and where my daughter went to collage.  It was a good episode
B00CJGP116|5.0|I love Marc's new song Vivir!  Wonderful message in his song.<br />Marc Anthony is a great artist in English and Spanish!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I've been playing bingo blitz on my kindle for 8 months and was doing good and I loved it. But for the past 2 months or more I can't play my 5 free tournament rounds and I miss it. All i can do is collect my daily credits until I collect enough to play in certain rooms, Do ya have any way to fix my app on kindle so I can play daily free rounds?
1451695195|4.0|reveals one person's after-life adventure .. a very talented work .. mentally challenging.  for both the casual reader and religious scholar.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|We recently traveled to Salzburg and took the Sound of Music Bus Tour so this movie was a must see again!  Nice extras with the 45th anniversary special DVD's.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|miss the old format with sun settings &amp;humidity uneasy to decipher.no pollen alerted and its hard to navigate back &amp;forth.hard to set up locations.ugh!
B00CATSONE|5.0|It had a lot of great information and lots of facts. If you like learning youll definitely love this book.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Great game to keep your mind working. Can get hard, been stuck on level for a while but I have to get it someday right?  Well worth the frustration.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|If you love comic book movies, this is for you!  This movie is guaranteed not to disappoint.  We loved it!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Enjoy lots of different challenges with different games of Bingo and Slots.<br />Can play in different rooms against your friends<br />Loads of fun.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The sealed decks is very nice and helped me learn what cards i need in my actual deck.  Much better than 2012
1439153663|2.0|I rarely write reviews, but I feel so betrayed by the lousy, half-assed endiing of this novel, I just had to say something.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of historical fiction, specially involving the Old South, so I was really excited to read \\"The Kitchen House\\". While the novel definetly had its weak spots, I was really drawn in by the charecters and pulled along by the story. I was really invested in the novel and it's outcome. That's what makes the ending of this book feel like such a slap in the face.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the author was under an extreme deadline, or died before the last was chapter finished, but I was completely astounded by the throw-away ending.  All the build up, all the horror, all the drama......and then nothing! The last two sentances were basically \\"Yadda, yadda, yadda, and they were kind of ok for a few years and then died\\". I don't know if the author gave up or just ran out of give-a-crap for her readers, but I'm completely insulted that she saw fit to hand her readers and ending like that. Frankly, I have half a mind to write the author a letter and demand my hard-earned money back. Be forewarned and spend your money on another selection
B0091WNK8M|4.0|We loved it!  42, 42, 12, & 9 years old.  All good.  We'd watch it again tomorrow!  Don't miss it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This Is A Pretty Fun Game. It Needs More Levels But The Puzzles<br />Are Challenging And Entertaining.<br />Don't Give Up And Don't Cheat And Solving The Puzzle Will Be More<br />Rewarding
B000001Y5J|5.0|This thirty minute E.P was released by Trent Reznor after a long battle with record company troubles. His bitter anger and frustrations about the whole situation is definitely apparent on the album/EP. Reznor's music is still edgy and atmospheric in the industrial/synth/dance vein but \\"Broken\\" is more straightforward and melodic than previous Nine Inch Nails releases.<br /><br />While I miss the angst of songs like \\"Head Like A Hole\\" from Pretty Hate Machine most of what you hear on \\"Broken\\" is still great. Songs like \\"Pinion\\", \\"Help Me I Am In Hell\\" and \\"Happiness In Slavery\\" have the hard pounding dance beats that are expected from Nine Inch Nails. It also includes two instrumental interludes \\"Wish\\" and \\"Gave Up\\".
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I truly like all the games I have played so far from G5 entertainment. I haven't had to spend any money as of yet to play which is also a plus.
B000W9179M|5.0|Paulo Coelho speaks to me. His writing is inspiring and thought provoking. I am grateful for every word he puts on paper. I highly recommend him. After you finish &#34;The Valkyries&#34;, read &#34;The Alchemist&#34;. I am in the middle of &#34;Brida&#34; right now and I am loving every moment of it.
B00DP8XSQ2|5.0|really a cool app! Have only used it once so far however it was very impressive & educational. Offers great family fun!
B00CY0JY88|2.0|The story got lost between all the explicit scenes. I struggled through three books, and still no conclusion. You can not compare it with Fifty shades of Grey.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Lisbeth Slander is one of my all  time favorite literary characters. She intelligent, tough as nails, fearless and feminine at the same time. The millennium series is one of the best reads ever.
1451695195|3.0|not compelling reading, but interesting.  The issue of near death experiences shows that humans are above the animal kingdom, because we can contemplate spirituality and the lower animals cannot.  Take that PETA!
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I really enjoy it playing it with another person during my lunch break.  I think my mind has gotten sharper by playing this game, thinking about my moves.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|Kevin Spacey is wonderful as is all of the cast.  Great writing and direction tops it off. Get it!  You won't be sorry.
B00008G8LF|4.0|This version of The king & I, was very worthwhile viewing. More representative of the period than the Yul Brenner misical version.
B002RI90WM|5.0|An interesting little book, the narrator being a dog.  Being a dog lover, I enjoyed how Garth Stein put all the  dog's thoughts in the narration.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Good 'shoot-em-up' with the rich undertones of a rapidly developing post-war L.A.  Locals will recognize the drop in names of Daryl Gates and William Parker.  Sean Penn's performance is perhaps a bit too overstated, and the now classic serious do-gooder and not-so-serious partner is a bit predictable.  But all in all a watchable, if somewhat violent at times, block of entertainment.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a really great book. It's funny, exciting, and a definite must-read for Percy Jackson fans. Rick Riordan has added a truly amazing book to his already great series. Sit down and enjoy.
0792164903|4.0|Great movie. Someone had borrowed my original copy, so I had to order a new one. Very entertaining and a must see for Johnny Depp fans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game very much, but it should go free for one day. also I would like it to be more updated with other stuff, and Mabe able to download nods if the nods if they are small enough
B0049P1VHS|5.0|What more can I say except this is the best show on television right now. I never enjoyed zombie movies so I was surprised to find myself glued to the tv from the very first episode. It's about so much more than zombies...it's about surviving in an impossible world.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Couldn't put it down - even on a very bumpy flight!  Definitely kept me mesmerized and entertained with the outstanding action and sharp plot twists.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|People generally assume The xx's second album is a pop sellout for them - this is not true. It does pick up the pace a bit on many songs, but I find that pleasant as some songs on their first release could be TOO quiet and slow. This album is actually a great compliment to the first and I am very excited to see what the third will sound like ;)
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If you're looking for a book to teach you easy, practical, and fun ways of learning how to apply energy (God in Action), then this book is for you! It's a must have book amongst your other books on awakening the &#34;Superman&#34; or &#34;Superwoman&#34; within.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|What more can I say except this is the best show on television right now. I never enjoyed zombie movies so I was surprised to find myself glued to the tv from the very first episode. It's about so much more than zombies...it's about surviving in an impossible world.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Awesome show !!!<br /><br />Chemistry between the characters is great.<br />Writing / dialogue suffered a little in a couple of episodes in Season-2 where you were left wondering what am I missing. But then again, it could be because this show has set the bar so high.<br /><br />But still a very intelligent show... even though the reality of the show seems a bit too harsh but perhaps in NY and Law, this is real life.<br /><br />Keep it going writers and actors (and investors).
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I used this driving down to Austin from Seattle - everything works fine. Would recommend, charges fast (enough) wish it was easier to see which port is the Apple v. Android though. Good purchase.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I like Patrick's writing style and how he introduces the theme of the book.<br /><br />The basically theme is that intelligence, work ethic, opportunities, and life experiences are factors that help people to succeed...BUT imagination is what drives innovation and what separates your amount of success from others.<br /><br />Tesla is an example of using intellect with imagination. His determination to always innovate and imagine new inventions was inspiring.  Tesla was truly passionate for his work and was not driven by the fame or money, or so the work led me to believe.  Not having much prior knowledge of Tesla, I wish that Patrick would have elaborated more on shortcomings of Tesla instead of placing him on a pedestal.  I feel like Patrick simply recounted the happenings of Tesla's life, but did not supply a dialogue along with that information.  I feel that this book contains the details you would say at Tesla's funeral...only mentioning the good things, even though there is ALWAYS bad that could be mentioned, but of course that is left out.<br /><br />Overall this book was a good, quick read that wet my appetite to look farther into Tesla, J.P. Morgan, and Edison.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son loves legos and he loves mine craft.  This was a perfect birthday gift.  I bought this along with a couple of minecraft t-shirts for him.  He was stoked.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Very surprised by this book.  New author (to me!) so I didnt know what to expect.  Easy to read; the story-in-a-story style was a great way to rapidly tell Kvothes story without having to dwell long on a single chapter.  Cant wait to read the sequel.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was an avid google reader User until it folded and I moved to feedly which now I prefer and like much better!
1419703692|5.0|Easily one of the best source for all inside information that is a part of making of this great trilogy. The amount of research and hard work that has gone into the making - awesome!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It provides you with lots of items to unlock and buy. The coins are easy to collect and the trains Move with coins on top. They have different places to visit and when you are at that place there is a limited edition character.<br />You should definitely buy this product.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Love it when I do not expect a great deal from a movie and am pleasantly surprised.  This Bond surprised me.
0375869026|4.0|This was the book my 11 year old chose for her summer reading book. She loved it! And she wants my mom and I to read it as well, says it's a great story and there's a good lesson to be learned. It was nice to see her so excited about the story.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO ADDICTIVE....I JUST LOVE IT..ME AND MY HUSBAND FIGHT OVER THE COINS ALL THE TIME.....YOU JUST GOTTA GET THIS SUPER SUPER FUN GAME
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Not being a full-blown Katy Perry fan, I was told I still needed to see this. I love all music, so I gave it a shot. I was singing along with some songs, tearing up during her darker moments, and cheering her to continue being herself. It's a nice movie where we're able to take a glimpse into the tough life of musicians.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|This book was fantastic fun. Well written, great literary references and intelligent humor make it a great summer book. Though the book isn't dealing with seriously weighty issues, its not a a fluff book either. The style of the author reminds me of Jim Butcher's Dresden Files in all the good ways and I can't wait to see this author ten or twenty years down the road.
1439152799|4.0|I liked this book, although it was sometimes long-winded. It got to the point where I couldn't wait to see how it was all going to tie together.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I like this game! Manjong keeps my mind, hands, and eyes moving! I like that.  The summer theme is refreshing compared to the typical standard tile setup.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This is one of those books where the ending makes up for the deficits of the rest of the book.  The first 25 pages are fine, I guess, and the ended is really interesting.  There is a nice twist at the end.  However, the entire middle of the book is hard to get through.  This may be a personal reaction, but the dialogue range incredibly false for all characters.  I could never imagine real people talking the way the characters did.  Also, I found each character unbelievably annoying and grating.  The child was over the top with his petulance and &#34;teenage angst&#34; - iness.  The father was so &#34;certain&#34; and the mother so worrisome.  Each character acted in a stereotypical manner to the extreme.  Even the minor characters were all like cartoons.  I would have given this book 1 star, but the ended was pretty good.  I would strongly urge you to avoid this book.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I purchased the audio version of this book, and really appreciate being able to hear the author read it with his tone and inflections in parts he is trying to get across.
B000I186FW|5.0|very smart movie every american should see . the government should be afraid of the people i could what it again and again
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I've read Catherine Ponder, Florence Scovel Shinn, and Napoleon Hill… This, this is the book you gave me the exact &#34;how to&#34; but I've always been looking for. Get this book, read it, do it!
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Our granddaughter introduced us to this PBS series........everyone should watch.  We now are caught up and ready for the new season.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This was my first foray into the world of Lee Child and is the first of the Jack Reacher novels. It was interesting, gripping, and I liked Jack Reacher in spite of his faults. His life hasn't been easy and this story certainly doesn't change that! Even if you've read other Reacher books, read this one!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|I thought it was hilarious, and a good story line. They could have let the F word out, it was only one time, but I hate that word. Good movie!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Hunger Games is a great movie that our whole family enjoyed. It really makes you think about what could be in store for the future...
B004RJMUJO|5.0|My son loves this game. He often use my kindle and thanked me today for down loading it. I like the educational fruit-facts.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Pushes YOUTUBE and NETFLIX seamlessly, I wish from my Android tablet it would cast the Chrome browser, I guess that will come soon enough. It does from my laptop and desktop though. Great price.
B001SKB1Y0|5.0|This is a different story and the actors are great! Penelope Cruz definitely deserved that Oscar! The scenes from Spain are absolutely beautiful!
B00008WT5E|5.0|My favorite AC/DC of all time. I agree with the reviewer above, no wasted motion on this album. I had the pleasure to sit and talk to Cliff Williams yesterday in Asheville, NC and I asked him about this album. He said it was his favorite AC/DC album of all-time with Back in Black second. He was one of the nicest guys I have ever met. Very humble and grateful of what he achieved. He was working with a music school for kids and even got on stage with them and played Highway to Hell. I thought the kids were going to pass out.<br />See link:<br />[...]
1401235417|3.0|artwork was okay. story was okay. Better than the movies that are dull. I usually try to get any modern comics from the public library first, before shelling out the money.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I just needed to read this book because I had lost my creativity and integrity - now I am not so affraid to try things again. Thank you for this Austin Kleon.<br /><br />Trini, Norway
B00BDRJ3Z2|4.0|Not my favorite Luke Bryan, the songs all sound the same to me. But I still love him! I like his new CD much better, a variety of songs!
080701429X|5.0|We have have been desensitized to the horrors of war, but the texture of the Franlk papers can not be easily read without distress.  He plainly presents his experiences and observations in a way that is accessible to most readers.<br /><br />His theories, which predate Freud, are inspired.  They are not lost in the post Freud psychological chaos.  He puts forward a simple concept, that has echoed forever in poems, stories and the contemporary media.<br /><br />\\"I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself.\\" D. H. Lawrence also quoted by Hollywood in G.I.Jane<br /><br />Regardless of how you get there, we need to accept our circumstances and look for what is of value to us.<br /><br />Frankl's work may be set in a particular time, but the concepts are timeless.<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone that loves life.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I think I've loved this movie pretty much since the first time I saw it. . . Christina Ricci's character is so adorable, and James McAvoy's pretty blue eyes sure don't hurt. Very excited that I found it so easily, and that it wasn't too expensive. It's a very cute movie.
B002VPPS18|5.0|Disney Studios 16th full length animated feature film is one of my favorites. Sleeping Beauty is one of the studios most ambitious with absolutely stunning animation and released on Blu Ray in a stunning 2.55:1 aspect ratio transfer (the film's original aspect ratio). This is Disney's best Princess movie and certainly a step up after the Lady and the Tramp which seemed ordinary when compared with the animated full length feature films that came before it.<br /><br />The film looks amazing on Blu Ray as flawless as I can imagine it could look, the colors pop even more on this sparkling Blu Ray treatment than ever before. The characters seem to be overshadowed by Disney's breathtaking artistry with comedic elements kept to a minimum here. The extras are plentiful and about as good as you could expect with all noteworthy past features carried over.<br /><br />The film has never looked or sounded better and I doubt if ever will get better than this, so if you're a fan, buy it! It's one of Disney's best releases to Blu Ray so far. I own the Steelbook Edition and the packaging it fantastic!<br /><br />If you don't own any edition, then the Blu Ray is by far the best choice.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is so well done.  It is nonstop drama, but isn't lame soap opera type drama.  I hope this series continues for many more seasons.
0307474259|4.0|I wish all my doctors...every doctor I ever had...would read this book!  I got so tired of hearing \\"calories in/calories out.\\"  I had doctors tell me to cut back on sugar and then said to drink skim milk.  When I asked them if they had any idea how much sugar was in skim milk they said no!!!!!  I have metabolic syndrome and this is about the only thing that makes sense.  Like so much nowadays, we won't hear this from doctors or food manufacturers since doctors rarely study nutrition and food companies are only out there to make a buck.<br />I think this book should be required reading in the medical community.  I would have given it another star if it gave more \\"recipes\\" or touched on the subject of coconut oil and almond and coconut milk.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I have all of the Sonic Screwdrivers available on the market and this one is my favorite. Just like the 10th Doctor's. Great seller and fast delivery!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My husband and I are kids at heart and love watching movies like this. We loved the video game references and found ourselves laughing throughout the adventure. Great message to learn at the end for adults and kids!
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|The worst of all die hards! Acting was not good, I could go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story is fresh, the character's believable. No cardboard characters here. I can only hope that Shift and Dust are just as good! Thanks for a good read, I got lost in your story. Books like this only come along once in a blue moon. Now off to read Shift!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved it could put the book down, well written, it did make me cry! This is the first book that I have read by Jojo Moyes, will not be my last. I have recommended this book to several friends.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I was surprised at the quality of the graphics.  I'm enjoying it very much and look forward to more chapters.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is fun for what it is. It's a good game when you are in a waiting room, it makes the time go by faster...
B000I9WW6I|5.0|I love this movie. The performances are almost perfect by everyone. I've watched it 50+ times and will likely watch it just as many more.
B00BN3ECTS|4.0|Maybe if you're on the shallow end of the intellect pool you will like this, or if you're a fan of unintentionally bad or hilarious films, but critics and most smart folks dislike the movie.<br />It is one of the best bad on accident movies you will ever see, though! Unintended bad things are in this movie and I have to say the twist surprise endings was one of the downright most idiotically hilarious things you'll see ever. Let's just say I never knew ghosts could be surprised.<br />Watch it with friends for the best results!
B00C9PQ7I8|4.0|You would be blessed to own this music. Great songs and sounds. Great gift idea or just for your own self.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|This is a great new album from the Bad Boys of Boston.  Aerosmith is still the best band.  Can't wait for another album.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Overall, I found this book difficult to read, despite an interesting plot and setting.<br /><br />The main characters changed rapidly from heroic and likeable to whining and horrid within paragraphs. Sometimes I felt like giving the characters a good talking to - that's how frustrated I was with the characters behaviour and internal commentary.<br /><br />I feel as though the story was too rushed. Characters didn't seem to have a chance to catch up with what was happening - Thor was in a village, then at the castle, then at the Canyon - and the events in-between the setting changes were unbelievable, like Thor being accepted into the Royal Family for using his powers during a tournament.<br /><br />I gave up on this book about 60% of the way through, disappointed with the rushed storyline and characters. I hate leaving a book unfinished but I'm just not certain I want to waste more time slogging through this book.
B00846REIS|5.0|Better than 50 shades, can't wait to read the next one! Couldn't put this book down stayed up till 3:30 am reading it!
B009CF7GRY|4.0|This was a good movie..I was curious about it since the original movie came out when I was in my late teens or so..I enjoyed this one too, the music is awesome!!
B002N5N4MG|5.0|So funny. its genius......so different from other comedy shows. you can actually learn a lot by watching this scientist and physicist duke it out. cant stop watching.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I've been wanting to see this movie for quite a while. I was very pleased and would recommend to anyone who likes a good sci-fi.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This games keeps you on your toes, wanting more and more of this exciting game.  Full of colors you can't go wrong with it.
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|This dvd is more than worth the price I paid for it.  This band IS America's best Rock-n-Roll band!  Only Aerosmith would travel to Japan against everyone's warnings.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Didn't think I'd like this, but I'm completely hooked? Best thing since IT Crowd!<br />Got to love the geek/science/humour blend.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a really fun game to play. It just takes a while to get things done if you don't make any in-app purchases. Some of the dragons can only be purchased by buying extra of what you need because you don't earn it through the game itself very fast.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|A creative exciting story that makes you turn pages faster than a binding spell. I enjoyed this book very much!
B00000AFDW|5.0|my husband said it was one of the best gifts he had ever gotten. we both loved it and will buy more.
B0016K40KY|1.0|Like many others that have ordered it the second disk is faulty and only plays for a few minutes.<br /><br />I reported it to the supplier but my email was never answered.  Several weeks later I investigated and found  a return code at my Amazon account BUT it stated that the code would be voided in THREE days and I got the notice on a FRIDAY and I live in ALASKA!!<br /><br />That's no way to do business.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|I found this a really good read.  Perhaps it was a little slow to get going, but the mere fact that the main character awakes each day with no memory of her past makes this inevitable ... until she finds, with the help of her doctor, a way to deal with this problem.  In due course she has an occasional flashback and meanwhile the ongoing question is &#34;Is her husband who he says he is?&#34;  Towards the end the tension is really notched up and it deserves its description of a psychological thriller.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|I've tried other devices that were supposed to work as this one does, and been disappointed.  Thanks to Andy Ihnatko from Mac Break Weekly for recommending this.  Works like a charm.
B000001EIA|5.0|on of the best gifts i have bought my husband loved it. it was so easy to find and buy online.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I was delighted by this movie. The trailers left me only marginally interested and my wife entirely uninterested. I watched it despite my ambivalence one night when my wife was out of town, and found myself suggesting that we watch it when she got back home. We did and I watched it from a different perspective given what I learned the first time, and I found it just as enjoyable the second time around. Interesting, mysterious, good special effects, good action, just a fun watch.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|The actors all bring their \\"A game\\" but the script doesn't quite allow any character to be fully developed beyond the push and pull of plot demands.  The two \\"romantic dramas\\" could have been almost eliminated.  What mattered more was that these two loners had few people to count on and formed a friendship based upon a fighting spirit to survive.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|I bought this doll for my Grand Daughter's birthday, and she loves it, and plays with it every day. Will buy more for X Mass
B000JQUHLM|4.0|I was very glad to find this book and to be able to continue to find out about what happened to her as she grew up. it was very good.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Really dislike the upgrade. Made it into some stupid commerialized dumbed down application. All cartoony and you can't see anything through the background picture.
B00006LPER|3.0|A fifty-ish music professor has an impossible combination of mental, emotional, and sexual dysfunctions.  A woman like her would have been in a mental institution, prison, or a coffin years earlier.  What was meant to symbolize  perfectionism in one part of a personality masking the disintegration of others just ends up draining the audience's belief and empathy.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I love being on the go & still able to purchase items directly from my tablet.  It make it so convenient.  My tablet is set up to use Google Play, but for some reason I can't seem to get it to work, so I choose my apps from my PC & then download them to my tablet from my Wish List at Amazon.  I know, I know... I could use the amazon apps app but that doesn't seem to work well either on my tablet (or maybe it is the operator's error).  I don't know, it just doesn't work, but this app does & it makes my life so much easier.  My grandson (6) can select his favorite apps & put them in my Wishlist & then we download them to my tablet while we are on the go.  Works great for us, too.
1451627297|5.0|The other reviews have covered all of the basics of the story so I will make my thoughts brief: I'm not an avid Stephen King fan, I might catch some of his movies or TV shows that have been based on his books, but have rarely read his books. I'm glad I read this one, from cover to cover!! It has all the makings of an excellent story; well developed characters, romance, action and a dose of science fiction! No matter what you look for in a good book, you will find it here! 5 Stars!
B000VWYNNW|5.0|I  love the fact that I now have the concert version on cd and yes the sound is incredable.  But I wish Jimmy would have remastered the 1976 album as well.  The versions of No Quarter, Dazed and Confused, stairway in my opinion are better then these.  listening to this cd it is obvious that the 1992 rematsterd cd of the 1976 album I have  needs to be redone.  Jimmy  if you see this please get to work on this straight away. lol.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|handy notebook is multifunctional, easy once you get to know it and gorgeous.  Just got this app one day ago but so far I think I love it! Gonna keep working with it so I can know more and maybe give an even better review.
1609611543|5.0|Well, this is not 'good news' but it is vital that we know about our food and about wheat.  I have taken steps to limit my wheat consumption although it is hard.  Wheat is in everything.  But knowing one can be cautious.
B000007UXS|5.0|What can you really say about one of the best pure rock albums ever recorded.  Sounds great on Vinyl.  Period.
0375413405|5.0|I bought this because I was starting to get my library's copy dirty and enjoyed it so much. This order came promptly and in great condition. I would recommend this to any person looking to expand their knowledge of cooking, not just in the French style but also some basic techniques and food knowledge. If you have Amazon Prime, you can also watch all episodes of The French Chef to help you with some of the more popular recipes in the book. There's even some stuff she does that isn't in this edition.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|I meen really it might have cost something when all of you that hate it got it but right now for me its. free not $3.99 so I'm. getting it
B000NGTJTY|4.0|The end of this movie is awful. All who have seen it know what I mean. There is one thing and one thing only that should NOT have happened at the end of the movie.  What happens when Costigan and Sullivan when the elevator doors open completely ruined the movie for me.  I don't care how the 2002 foreign original ended but this is America and it should have ended with without that happening to the only F-ing person to like in this movie.  Literally, every other character is a total scumbag person and I am including the \\"good\\" guys of the film.  I just think there are so many ways that movie could have ended in a positive way.  I will not dwell on the arguments against my opinion, I know there are many people who think it was great in every way but, to me, you're wrong. I do think the movie was very entertaining and enjoyable; one of Martin's best, but I still think the ending $ucked.  Anyway, its worth the $3 to rent.
0385349947|5.0|It's hard not to notice the disconnect - women are outperforming men in the classroom, yet this isn't translating into equal representation in the top tiers of business.  [[ASIN:0385349947 Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead]] is all about exploring why women are underrepresented in these positions and what they can do to increase their chances of getting there.  It's also one of the best books about career development I've read since [[ASIN:0307351130 Basic Black: The Essential Guide for Getting Ahead at Work (and in Life)]], and I've read quite a few books on professional development.  I found it to be very well written and a fast read because I found the content interesting and highly relevant.<br /><br />Obviously there were quite a few things I liked about this book.<br /><br />First, I liked that focused on tangible things women can be doing to make sure their achievements line up with their ambition.  This isn't to say that there aren't systematic reasons more women aren't making it to the C-Suite, there are likely those too and they are acknowledged in the book.  But our own personal behavior is often a lot easier to adjust, especially to increase success in the short term. I especially appreciated that it covered both things inside and outside of the office.  I think a lot of books recognize the mistakes women sometimes, unconsciously, make at work that get in the way of furthering their careers.  But often books ignore the fact that our personal lives also can impact what we are able to achieve in positive and negative ways.  In particular there was a chapter called 'Make Your Partner a Real Partner' that struck such a cord that I shared it with my boyfriend.  It served as great springboard for us to talk about how our relationships can impact our career and what we both hope for in that department.<br /><br />I liked that a lot of the content covered here felt new (at least to me) and wasn't redundant from chapter to chapter.  Sure there were someconcepts I had read about in other books, but this book also brought to light a lot of less than helpful behaviors that I am 100% guilty of, and hadn't been aware I was doing.  While reading this, there were many lightbulb moments.<br /><br />I also liked that the book blended the author's personal experience (which is an interesting read in and of itself) with statistics and quotes from other business men and women.  It was successful in making the book feel personal, while still giving bigness to the ideas expressed.<br /><br />Overall I thought this was a fantastic book and gave me some concrete guidance about how to further my career.
B00B97SNJI|4.0|I feel the sound of this set of fine songs is a little too &#34;produced&#34;. The bass is recorded a little heavier than most of my other CDs, &#34;requiring&#34; me to adjust the sound on my stereos.<br /><br />I love &#34;Most People&#34; and &#34;From a Window Seat&#34;. &#34;Just beneath the Surface&#34; is good, as are most of the songs. The lead singer is a little non-descript, but suits the material.
B003G4W49C|5.0|You will enjoy the book and it is a quick read.  What else can you say but you won't regret it.
0062238868|5.0|Good book by one of the greatest heroes from our generation. Kids should look up to people like this instead of Miley, or Kim or any of those other non-role models.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|this book was ok but not the best, I was not paying good attention when I bought a short story, instead of a novel
B001DJLCPE|5.0|This movie is a great classic with a fantastic performance from Peter Sellers and others. I still laugh every time I watch it.
B008MM9630|4.0|This is a good game and I really l I keep the fact that I can play independently from others but having to purchase gems is a no go for my budget. I am having a few issues with the game, after I  did a defrag it keeps kicking me out and I have to redo things.
B00008J2PG|5.0|I saw the film when it was on TV back in the 80s.  It's a great story which has the additional virtue of being a true story.
B001NLL8LA|3.0|this book had a very well developed plot and incorporated several surprise twists, Jack Reacher is a interesting character, a drifter that is only concerned with doing the right thing
