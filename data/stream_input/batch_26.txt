B00000IRED|5.0|Truman's universe is anything but seamless.  Odd things fall out of the sky.  People behave in strange ways, and some of them even try to tell him Things Are Not What They Seem To Be.  Yet he clings fiercely to that  version of reality which has been presented to him.  Eventually he begins  to realize that things just are not adding up and he escapes, overcoming a  fear instilled by his &quot;creator&quot; in the process.<br />Having recently  escaped from a religious cult, I was surprised by the intensity with which  I identified with Truman.  Near the end, when he shouts at the sky, hardly  knowing who he is addressing, &quot;Is that the best you can do?  You're  going to have to kill me!&quot;  I wept, for I know what it is to overcome  such obstacles.<br />The Truman Show reminded me of of James Burke's PBS  series, The Day The Universe Changed.  One of most heroic parts of our  humanity is the ability to change the universe we live in.  This movie put  me in touch with that part of my humanity.
0964385619|5.0|Don't take your advice from thousandaires, take it from millionaires.  This book changed the way I look at my own personal &quot;balance sheet&quot;.  I was one of those who thought a house was an asset before  reading this book.  I loved it so much I bought his second book, Cashflow  Quadrant.  Both books were recommended to me by people who are already  millionaires.  Be careful who you take your advice from.  Play his game,  also, it's eye-opening.
B000002JKA|5.0|Cerebral rock at its best.  You can call it pretentios, pompous, deep, musical grandstanding, soap-opera rock, etc.  But what AWAKE does to the listener is what few bands have ever been able to do:  actually MOVE the  listener.  This band makes you think (a novel idea which most bands are  afraid of doing!).  They do so by challenging your ears and your mind.   They offer a myriad of themes and emotions that constitute the AWAKE album.   They sent me on an emotional roller coaster after listening to the bone  crunching 7-string riffs and tortured, yet epic storytelling of &quot;The  Mirror&quot; and &quot;Lie.&quot;  The double kicking thump n' chunk of  &quot;Caught In a Web&quot; just blew me away.  The phenomenal  &quot;Erotomania&quot; rocks then eases into an intricately beautiful  passage, then powerfully emotional solo by John Petrucci.  The gentle  acoustic strums of &quot;The Silent Man&quot; do just that to you when the  last chords fade out: leave you breathless.  The odd time grooves and  soaring vocals of &quot;Voices&quot; puts me in the place of its mentally  and emotionally distraught subject, almost leaving me in tears when James  Labrie sings the passionate passage &quot;I'm lying here in bed, swear my  skin is inside out, just another sunday morning...&quot; &quot;Space Dye  Vest&quot; follows the themes of &quot;Mirror&quot; and &quot;Lie&quot; by  tackling similar subjects and even using a piano melody in &quot;The  Mirror&quot; as its basis.  &quot;Lifting Shadows off a Dream&quot; offers  the most gorgeous bass intro and guitar pattern around.  Even Portnoy's  disc/splash/china/china/china pattern put a grin on my face from ear to  ear.  Absolute genius.  Rock theater at its greatest.  Every track is  great.  Check this one out and you'll be a DT convert for life.
6304913176|5.0|I'm wondering what is with all the bad reviews for this great movie. Most everything is right in this movie and it has everything. It's got violence, gore, nudity, drama that doesn't bog down the action, humour and above all,  a unique attitude. Unlike most war movies, Starship Troopes does'nt wallow  in the &quot;inhumanities of war&quot; but rather presents this and shows  some young people fighting for their beleifs and having a hell of a time  doing it!
B000009ED0|5.0|Wow what a great c.d.  There so many great songs on this and the all sound like nothing i 've heard before.  bawitdaba is worth the price of the c.d. alone.  but there some many good if not better songs on it.  i am the bull  god is great.  welcome to the party is blasting, f*ck off is offensive  (which is not a bad thing) cowbay is orginal,  where u at rock is the  greatest.  buy it now.  you can stop listening to it.

0451169514|5.0|I read this book when it first came out, when I was twelve, in only three days. I have since re-read it so many times my hard-cover copy is falling apart.  This is far and away my favorite Stephen King novel.  The  characters are wonderful...once you start reading, you can't get enough of  them. At times it is laugh-out-loud hilarious (especially Richie), at  others touching, sweet and innocent, and also very scary.  You can't get  better Stephen King than this. Don't let the length of this novel keep you  away; believe me, when you get near the end, you wish it would go on  indefinitely.

0780627016|5.0|When I first saw the previews for this movie I thought that it was just an effects film.  But it wasn't, it has one of the best screenplays I have ever seen to go along with the special effects.  I enjoyed the character  changes of the two teens in the film especially.  See if you can pick out  the visual references to &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;,  &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, and &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;
0800187873|5.0|An excellently told true story, based on the book by the real guy, Agent Joseph Pistone.  As you watch Pistone (Depp) infiltrate the mafia through unsuspecting Lefty (Pacino), you get a glimpse into their world.  The world  of cash, scams, and murder, and an undercover agent is thrown into the  middle of it all.  In the end, he needs to get out.  After all, this was  just his day job, but it became his life.  Incredible performances by  Pacino, Depp, and supporting actor, Michael Madsen.

0553573403|5.0|I am generaly not a fan of fantasy, but this book was one of the most exciting and interesting books I have ever read. The plot is great and the dark style is refreshing and makes the book unpredictiable. There are a lot  of names and sub-plots to keep track of, but the author does a good job of  presenting enough info so the reader can keep track. I did have two things  I did not like about the book though. The first one was the fact that most  of the characters are so young, yet act so mature. You get used to it, but  at first it is strange to think of. The other thing I did not like was the  way the book is broken down into chapters around a single main character.  Because of this, (espicaly in the second half of the book) you read about  what is going on with that character, then have to wait 100 pages to find  out what happnes next. I have not read the second book yet, but I hope the  author keeps the dwarf alive. I love that character and the way he thinks.  This is a great book. If you like fiction, you will like this book. Buy it!
630446651X|5.0|The greatest comedy a person could see. More laughs than anything from the 90's.  Mel Brooks special touch is by far amazing and makes all the difference in a wonderful movie full of fun and laughter.
0679735909|5.0|In grade school, I loved the Narnia series and The Borrowers, mainly because of the settings.  I still sometimes reread the Narnia books to get back to that quiet, in-between world with the many ponds.  I can just see  it in my mind.  Anyway, that's why I decided to reread Possession this  year.  For instance: <br />Clouds were darkly gathering; she could see through  the trees a full moon, which, because of some trick of the thickening air,  seemed both far away and somehow condensed, an object round and small and  dull.... There was a kind of cracking of cold in the woods all round, a  tightening of texture, a clamping together....The trees went up, solid.  A  kind of elemental clanging accompanied the disappearance of each into the  dark.  They were old, they were grey and green and stiff....A creature ran  out into her path; its eyes were half-spheres filled with dull red fire,  refracted, sparkling and then gone....Maud was inside, and the outside was  alive and separate.<br />Isn't that beautiful?  It's an exciting read, too.   It opens with a young grad student finding a mysterious letter from a  Victorian poet.  Who was the letter to? Did she write back?  What happened  next?  Possession won the Booker Prize, and it's  so good that you'll find  yourself rereading it every couple of years just to be put under Byatt's  spell again.
B0000022WA|5.0|A remake could never match the great acting and magic of the classic.  No one can replace Hayley Mills, Maureen O'Hara, and Brian Keith!

B00000016W|5.0|I could go on forever about &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and many other Beach Boys/Brian Wilson gifts, but I'd only be repeating what so many others have already said. If only this country had the equivelant of  &quot;Knighthood&quot; as Great Britain does, then certainly Sir Brian is  as worthy as Sir Paul. I will simply say: Thank You Mr. Wilson. You have  given us all the gift of melody and harmony unsurpassed! Your music is a  national treasure!
0316286869|5.0|Kevyn Aucoin is the true master of make up and his attitude that all women can be beautiful makes this a one of a kind book.

0553275569|5.0|Chock full of sweeping history of the space program, leavened with generous anecdotal gossip.  How clever is the Man in the White Suit, to take this story back to Edwards AFB and test pilots.  I reread this book  every few years, or whenever I want to get goosebumpy about America all  over again.  Dredging up Grissom's capsule is bound to revive interest in  this book, and the movie for that matter, which both richly deserve.  If  all books were as gripping, we wouldn't have TV.
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down is great. it is a must have not only is the music hard hitting and pulsating with emotional rage  the lyrics stand for something.Serj (the lead singer)spews out the harsh reality of this world  full of genocide and hatred through extreme and deafening verses of hatred  and anger. It is loud pulsatin guitar riffs mixed with a sort of primal  Armenian chant (yes they are Armenian) I give a great roccomendation for  this its not only a great listen but also a great lesson ALL HAIL SYSTEM OF  A DOWN!!!!!!! LET US INVESTIGATE THE REVOLT!!!!DOWN WITH THE SYSTEM!!

6304806426|4.0|quickly: This movie's about the artificial borders civiizations create to &quot;control&quot; people and that people install to insulate themselves. This is what holds together a film others have mislabled episodic,  superficial. Every scene in the movie conveys this, from Almassy being shot  down for flying over the wrong place to Katherine's inability to enter a  men's club.     <br />The love story is not amoral, its civilization and order  vs. passion and chaos, what most good love stories have been about from  Romeo and Juliet to Casablanca. The two &quot;adulterers&quot; die at the  end, that would have been good enough for Shakespeare.<br />The corpse does  suffer the effects of Rigor Mortis. You can even see the black shadow  around it's eyes, with the shoulders the only visible part of it's body  during those scenes.  Also please remember the flashbacks are from the POV  of a man revisiting the great love of his life.<br />A very good movie, nicely  shot and slyly SUBVERSIVE.  Ignore complaints against &quot;errors&quot; of  continuity, of Ishmael not being on the Peqoud when it goes down and yet  relating the adventure in Moby Dick(also neither boring nor THE WORT NOVEL  EVER WRITTEN).  All that sound and fury is just misdirected silliness, soon  to be as anachronistic and telling as a Cave of Swimmers in the desert.
0425107469|5.0|I have read several of Dean Koontz books.   Some of them I liked very much, others I didn't care for at all.   This one was bar far the best of his, and one of the best I have ever read.  I read this book at least 5 or  6 years ago (maybe more) and the story has stayed with me.   I read alot,  and sometimes have trouble remembering a story even though I know I've read  the book.  Maybe it's because I'm a dog-lover that I loved this book so  much, but the story itself was very unique.  What a wonderful imagination!   I highly recommend this book to anyone, you won't regret reading it, and  you won't soon forget it.   Like many others, I would love for Dean Koontz  to write a sequeal to this book.
0790736918|5.0|I've never been a big fan of John Wayne, however this film has something special to offer. The Searchers is more than another fun film: it actually takes up deep ideas and handles them with sophistication. Wayne is the  typical lonely American hero; he is the embodiment of the ideal of American  freedom developing directly from John Locke (yes the British philosopher).  A string of anti-social &quot;stars&quot; can be traced back through  Fenimore Cooper's Natty Bumpbo and Twain's Huck Finn. The basics of social  contract theoey developed by Locke claims that freedom and society are  antithetical. In The Searchers we witness the enactment of that conflict:  Wayne (the searcher forver outside) and the more social settlers (with a  roof over their heards). The conflict between freedom and society, and the  sacrifices required for settled existence are manifest throughout the film.  The other deep issue taken up in this film is the question of community  itself. What constitutes a true community? In The Searchers we see Wayne  who has family (what he calls blood kin) and Martin (the half-breed child)  who is constantly reminded by Wayne that he has no family. Yet as Wayne  searches for his blood kin (his neice) we are constantly aware that he is  fully prepared to kill her if she has been taken sexually by the Comanche.  All the while Martin, who has no blood kin yet who was raised with genuine  affection in the family of the missing girl, feels that he is part of the  family--even more so than is her uncle who would kill her. At the very end  of the film Wayne (Nathan) and Martin must deal with having re-taken the  long sought for neice. Wayne had been certain to kill her for years,  suddenly decides not to. Initially this seems strangley out of character.  But realize that Martin searched with Nathan for five years, and though he  is unable to claim any blood relationship to the now young lady he  genuinely loves her as a sister. In a wonderful twist on the all tootypical romnantic theme, it is Martin's love for his sister that redeams  her in Wayne's eyes and makes him finally realize that community (of which  family is only the most basic level) is more than blood. This film has some  good humor, wonderful cinematography, and genuinely deep themes. A  wonderful film for those wanting more than just another cowboy movie.

B000002GY9|5.0|My introduction to Tom's music.  And what an introduction I might add! An amazing album.  It is hard to explain, you have to listen to this one yourself.  I have all of Tom's albums and they are all great.  But this one  is still my favorite.

0790739909|5.0|I loved and still love this movie. It is my #1 favorite movie. The only bad thing about it was the flippity ending. But when you put it together as a hole, what you end up with is the movie of this millenium. Sad and  tearful and inspriring. All my friends love it. So does my boyfriend!
B00000ILBK|3.0|Technically, this has one of the best DVD picture transfers I've yet to see, although the Dolby Surround soundtrack wasn't as punchy as it could have been.<br />The film is so dull. Even the battle sequence in the Briar  Patch is dull (nothing compared to the excitement when the Enterprise  crashed in Generations). <br />A better way to have ended the film would have  been to have lots of federation ships fighting the Sona and to bring about  what was hinted at - the fall of the Federation. That would have made a  good ending. <br />What we're left with though, is the fall of Star Trek - the  films just aren't daring and don't push any boundaries.
B000002U8G|5.0|One of These Days is fabulous-I love it. But Echoes, ah, Echoes. What can I say but that it is surely one of their brightest diamonds. I could listen to it for hours and never tire of it. So many wonderful sounds intertwined  with some of David's greatest guitar. How in the world did they come up  with it? Anyone with even the remotest interest in the Floyd has to have  this album.
B00000IQMT|5.0|The new STAR WARS score for EPISODE I - THE PHANTON MENACE is nothing short of spectacular.  &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; is the best match of music and visual ever constructed for a SCI-FI film.  Not only do we get a  battle scene for the ages, we get music to match.  Anyone in their right  &quot;SITH&quot; mind will get the track and remember how versatile John  Williams (our best film composer, bar none) really is.  Oscar nominee, no  doubt about it, come FEBRUARY.
B00000IQV7|5.0|This was the best movie I saw in 1998, period.  I went into that theatre expecting some good laughs in classic Robin Williams style.  And i received just that, a performance that reminded me of his old stand up routines.   The comedy was historical, something that many othersa will try to live up  to.  But it also brought me to tears, something I never dreamed I'd do in a  Robin Williams movie.  This movie was perfect, made you laugh, made you cry  and was emotionally charged through the entire length.
B000002UDV|5.0|And more importantly, who cares? This is a fascinating album, full of as many musical textures as Brian Wilson and his collaborators could possibly squeeze out of a group of musicians. The lushness of the arrangements, the  sonic ideas, and the surprises inherent in the songwriting are all amazing,  and a patient listener will be rewarded. <br />But it is not for everyone.  This is a melodic album of music arranged by mid 60's orchestral standards,  and therefore often sounds very similar to elevator music, especially if  you don't listen carefully. It is also a very moody album, which may not be  what you are looking for. <br />People who compare this album to &quot;Sgt.  Pepper's&quot; completely miss the point. First of all, this album slots  between &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; in relation to the  Beatles canon. Second of all, the comparison must be seen in the context of  60's bands who were rushing to be the most innovative, the first to use  spectacular sound effects, the first to make an instrument sound that  particular way. The Beatles went for special effects, the Beach Boys for  orchestral effects. <br />But most importantly, the Beatles made their music  immediatly accessable, so that anybody, regardless of musical  sophistication, could listen to their music and understand it. The Beach  Boys, for a short time, made music that is not as neatly accesable, that  actually requires some cautious listening to truly understand it.<br />But  comparison is only so useful. This is an intensely good album, full of  incredible sonic imagery and effects. If you are a casual listener, you  really need to borrow a copy from somebody else and listen before buying.  If you are serious musical adventurer, who takes the time to truly enjoy  music, this album, and perhaps it's accompanying box set, are for  you.<br />Enjoy!!
0375707972|5.0|This book is beautifully rendered, poetic and philosophical.  It provides a unusual perspective on Nazi Germany -- about the roles and impacts on ordinary people that makes you stop and think about the nature of evil.   This is a book that helps go beyond cliched thinking.  Good and evil are  not black and white here.  I read a lot of novels and this is one of the  few this year I am recommending to everyone.  I continue to be haunted by  this novel.

B00000IOSU|2.0|Man, what a let down, is Sarah ever going to release any new material?  I was hoping to hear something that hasn't been commercialized upon yet, doesn't sarah think that she's made enough money off of these songs?  Now  we're not just gonna have to hear Angel on the radio every five minutes,  but we're gonna have to hear a live version of it too?  and c'mon people, I  really like sarah's voice and her songs are well written, but a goddess?   Sarah McLachlan is a woman just like any other woman, the difference  between her and us is that her talent has been recognized and captured by  the media/public, we are all as talented as her in some way or another, she  just happened to take initiative and harness her future by getting herself  in the right place at the right time with the right people that had enough  money.  Now that she's done that we put her on a pedastal and by living  vicariously through her, we don't try to achieve it ourselves.  Goddess  indeed, woman I say! Grrrrr....
B00000IQB7|3.0|My Science project is a classic 80's thrill ride.  This explosive comedy was one of my favorites.  A weird glowing orb is placed in the hands of a kid by fate.  (He fell in a hole) When power is introduced to the  &quot;machine&quot; space time and every thing unholy takes over a local  high school.  See this movie.
B00000ING2|5.0|Arguably the best film made from the crafty minds of those Cohen brothers.  As visually inventive and stunning as movies get with wonderful performances from the leads as well as Bruce Cambell and John Mahoney in  small supporting roles.  <br />One of my all-time favorites.  And the disc is  in wonderful anamorphic widescreen.

630428540X|2.0|I am amazed at the way people throw around 5-star reviews on this site.  If Phenomenon is the best movie you've ever seen, then you haven't seen enough movies.<br />This is the story of a guy that gets hit by some sort of  ball of alien light, which gives him clarity of mind and memory,  telekinetic powers and limitless energy.  Meanwhile, everyone else in the  movie has an IQ of about 50 or below -- from his auto-mechanic friends to  the town doctor to the federal government goons that take him into  custody.<br />If you want to watch an unintentional comedy, here's your movie.
6305169187|5.0|Bruce Willis did a great job in this movie! I don't know how the other reviews could say the movie stunk. It tied drama,humor,and action all together. If you haven't seen this movie, go do it today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000DFSK|5.0|I was a new fan who had just heard Sunday Bloody Sunday on the radio, and a few days before With or Without you. It sounds dumb but those were the first time I heard those songs and needed to get them both. So made the  mistake of buying them both on one cd instead of getting War or the Joshua  Tree. It was fine at first 'till I heard the original &quot;New Years  Day&quot; on the radio. My favorite song here was cut up the first time I  heard it. Aside from that, being the first time for me hearing many classic  songs (Pride, Unforgetable fire, I will Follow)the music is all terrific.  The first 9 tracks are great (save for Bad and Still Haven't found what I'm  looking for, those songs are good, but overrated). Sunday Bloody Sunday is  intensity beyond words, one of my fav songs ever rivaled here only by New  Years Day, what a classic beggining. Beautiful and Haunting. With or  Without you, there biggest hit for good reason is amazing. The  Unforgettable fire is beautiful. Those 4 are my favs here. I never listen  to the last five cause they are so boring compared to the earlier tracks.  But the hidden song October is very good. <br />Don't buy this if you are just  getting into U2 and want a collection of there classics, go buy Joshua  Tree, War, and Unforgettable Fire first and throw in Achtung Baby. Get  those cd's. If you're cheap and just want a few of there 80's hits and  don't care if they are cut get this.
B00000DD2D|5.0|Although characterized by some traditional, hard-line blues critics as being &quot;too commercial and gimmicky&quot; a marketing ploy for such a force as the late great Mr. Jimmy Rogers... the fact remains IT WORKS! And  it works very well, to boot. So, WHO CARES if it was geared to reach a  broader market?  Certainly not me. This gem has cuts ranging from the low  down and dirtiest to the toe tappin'-est.  The guest &quot;all stars&quot;  (Mick, Taj, Healey, Clapton, and more) on this CD are HUGE assets.  They  compliment, enhance, blend, and meld with Rogers' voice and playing like  nobody's business.  In my humble opinion I say, if you like the blues,  especially the more modern ones, then don't just walk, walk, walk to buy  Blues, Blues, Blues... I suggest you ought RUN RUN RUN to get your hands on  this one!
6304011431|2.0|Oh No!  It's the Albino Electric Mime from Heaven!  Sean Patrick Flanery, wearing laughable white face makeup, makes his way through this mess of a movie as some sort of allegorical albino Jesus character with an affinity  for electricity.<br />As with many of these types of movies involving a  character who is supposed to be &quot;different and misunderstood,&quot;  the producers of Powder made certain that Flanery is surrounded by total  morons throughout.  From the cops to his schoolmates to the parents,  everyone is guaranteed to treat Powder as the outcast he is inevitably  supposed to be.  Even Jeff Goldblum, who has a scientific interest in the  kid's electrical weirdness, takes a long time to reason anything out.<br />And  the ending is hilarious.  I won't give it away, because if you've stuck  with the movie for this long (undoubtedly for comedy relief), then the big  punch line is at the end.  I assume the ending is supposed to be making  some sort of &quot;Big Statement,&quot; but....Bwahahahahaha!  How  lame!<br />Rating:  Overall:2 Stars   Unintentional Comedy Value: 5 Stars.
1558908455|5.0|Dusk till dawn is to the 90's what Psycho was to the 60's - not a shocker in the same vein but just plain fun - Kind of like the old EC comics in real-time.

B000002MG1|5.0|If you don't like Automatic For The People, you should be browsing the &quot;Books&quot; section. This is the only album that has ever made me thank the person who introduced me to it, the album you never tire of.
B000003AEB|5.0|Oh my god!! Oh my god!! Oh my god!! Oh my god!! Those were the expressions that i got when I first borrowed this CD from a friend, because I heard good things about Snoop Dogg's music, I was instantly hooked on those  phat beats(even though I never like a song from the first time I hear  it), this CD so far beyond &quot;off the hook&quot;, it's on the other side  of the lake!!<br />The best song are:<br />#1. Murder Was The Case<br />#2. The  Shiznit<br />#3. Gin And Juice<br />#4. G-Funk Intro<br />#5. Who Am I(What's My  Name)<br />Oh what am I saying, the whole CD is  tight!!!!!!!!!
0156528207|5.0|This book makes pretty dull reading for a 7 year old (or it did for me at least).  25 years later I find it an inspirational and challenging story for and about all of us.  It is deceptively &quot;small&quot;.  Give a copy  to someone who matters to you.
6304698798|5.0|Everyone has a favorite western and this is mine. Leone really outdid himself with this gem. Eastwood and Van Cleef are back from their previous experience in For a few dollars more, but it's Eli Wallach who steals the  show this time around. Sergio Leone's masterful blending of music and  visuals have been unequalled, and this film proves it. Also it's  letterboxed, the way it should be seen, and it includes an additional 15  minutes of footage (albeit in italian, but there are english sub-titles  available). Leone completists beware though, as this DVD doesn't include  all the scenes that were cut from the film. Still, a worthy treat for the  eyes and ears.
0805028846|5.0|Really good book.  Takes you through all the steps for many techniques; lots of pictures and diagrams.
0780627024|5.0|I just rented Pleasantville, watched it two nights in a row, and I'm here to order it now. Execllent comment on life and human nature.  Absolutley stunning visual effects.  Very enjoyable.  I will enjoy watching it again  &amp; again.
6302859204|5.0|This has to one of my favourite movies of all time. Very well written,and the acting was out of this world. The scene on the ship with walton and the aliens was very well done. But anybody who has read waltons book &quot;The  Walton Expereince&quot; will know that what really happened to him is  totally different from the film. I strongly recommend that you get the book  from Amazon.
B00000IQMT|5.0|Phantom Menace rates as one of the best soundtrack music to come not only from John Williams but also movies in general. I enjoyed hearing subtle (and not-so-subtle) hints of familiar Star Wars themes. You can hear how  Williams has evolved since the first Star Wars soundtrack in '77. Listen  closely, and you can hear influences of his other works, including Jurassic  Park. The track Duel of the Fates is incredible. There's always a  monumental, magnificent piece of music that stands out from Williams' works  (such as my personal favorite from Empire, Battle in the Snow) and Duel of  the Fates fits the bill nicely. Bravo, Mr. Williams! (The only  disappointments: Where's the rest of the music? Some more liner notes would  have been nice, as well.)
B000001Y42|5.0|This cd is great. They are better than Kid Rock. I greatly recomen this cd to any rap or metal fans.
0425107469|5.0|Great book that i couldn't put down once i started.I like all of his books, but this was definitly one of the best. He makes Einstein, Nora and Travis just come to life. I would recommend to anyone who likes a good  suspense book.
6305313687|5.0|when you watch this film, look at both sides of it. NOT just the nazi's racisim but that both sides of the color spectrum show sings of hate .
B000000OE7|5.0|This album has gotten me through a rough time with the loss of a loved one.  The opening track, the haunting &quot;It's a Beautiful Day&quot; segues into the sublime anthem &quot;Made In Heaven&quot; and sets one of  the most perfect album openings I have ever heard. &quot;I Was Born to Love  You&quot; is classic and every song has something special about it.  An  inspiration for years to come, this album will always be special to me.
0767805712|5.0|Well, certainly, this is one of that rearest films you can watch nowadays. And what is the greatest features of it, is that we can meet all this in the nearest future...rather scaring, frankly. Can you imagine, that you or  your future friend will be born out to this world out of the test-tube? I  can't...<br />Strange thing: while watching this, from one hand movie about  the future, you feel the 70's-80's. You hear classics, see the old cars  (working on the electric power..hehe) and the men and women, wearing the  clothes of that time.<br />Anyway, this film is worth buying and it will be on  the shelf of your favourite films, belive me.
B00000IO4J|5.0|all i can say is this is the best teen flick ever made to scare and make ya think, it is funny and scary and interesting, i loved it!!!
B00000IBRX|5.0|This movie wasn't meant too change our lives, but instead, wake us up to reality. We all have been curious about such issues at times. This is just one way of analizing our suspicions about life after death. I find it to be  very insiteful and creative. Anybody in the mood for intelectual thinking  should check this one out.
B000000W5F|3.0|This album opens with 2 great tracks including Start me up which is one of my fav. stones song but after hang fire, this album goes down hill. Something lacks from it. I say you try finding this used but its still good  to get for Start me up and Hang fire. If you're new to the Rolling stones  Get EXHILE ON MAIN STREET, BEGGERS BANQUET, OUT OF OUR HEADS and VOODOO  LOUNGE first. get all the good early stuff and work your way up.
0783233477|5.0|I have so much to say after watching this movie. I have seen the critics and the results are extremely different. Some people like it but some hate it, extremely.<br />Hopkins, without doubt, still the best.  Bard Pitt is  surprising good, especially when he plays the Death part.  He acts like he  really doesn't know how to do things in human world.  He is so naive and  innocent. He make the two differnt role totally differnt, even though with  the same appearance.<br />Claire Forlani is even better.  I have never notices  her existence on the big screen even though I have seen the rock.  This  movie kept my eye on her, especially her smile when she saw her love &quot;  Joe Black &quot;.  It looks like she is really deeply in love with her in  real.  The movie doesn't have many spaces for her to develop but she did so  well on her part. Even without any words or gestures, you can feel her  strong and intense passion by just seeing her expression.   I like to know  more about her due to the information on the DVD's intorduction part is not  enough.  Also, I would like to see her other movies because her excellent  performance in this movie.<br />In short, this movie becomes one of my  favorites.  Two-thumbs up.
0140281622|5.0|I thought this book was very good in the fact that it brought the depression to life.  Some of the people who hate this book don't even know what it is about.  The person who was complaining about the chapter  dedicated to a turtle probably has no clue that the turtle chapter is a  summary of the entire events of the entire book!
6302000823|5.0|The most accurate portrayal of real &quot;Italians&quot; that I've seen ever, &amp; I lived there..I cannot hear the music w/out becoming a blabbering idiot...gorgeous beyond comparison..if you miss this, you miss a  precious piece of humanity.  It defines life for me..
B000002NFM|5.0|This album shows the flexibility of the type of music that The Prodigy play.  This album is one of the best albums ever put together, and ranks #1 for dance/electronica albums!  It rocks the house and, in the words of Kool  Keith, blows your mind, drastically, fantastically.
0964385619|5.0|There is no shortage of broke people giving out advice.  Therefore if you want to be broke take their advice.  However, every once in awhile a wealthy person will offer advice that will truly help you.  Robert Kiyosaki  is one of these wealthy people with the genuine intention to assist you in  your financial goals.  You will enjoy this book for its simple,  mind-stretching concepts.

When you honestly do that you  will find that in most cases you have been taking financial advice from  other broke people.  Therefore is there any question to you now why your  financial statements look the way they do?  Rich Dad, Poor Dad is not the  financial &quot;bible&quot; it is simply one of the many solid books of the  financial &quot;bible&quot;.

Written by a Rich Dad who was once a  Poor Dad.
0380973464|4.0|It's kind of like ish if David Foster Wallace was a wise old Native American storyteller who grew up in Lynnwood, Washington (ever heard of it?) in the 1970s. Even, it's sort of like as though Thomas Pynchon wrote  The Fountainhead, with William Gibson and Steven Covey collaborating on the  20th century stuff to make a cyber-spy novel about modern business success,  ethics, funny things people do, and the decoding of messages.  <br />Cryptonoicon is a big book about two generations of karmic, &quot;it's a  small world&quot; nuclear families. The kind of families full of  hard-striving, big-big-big characters.  They are basically divided into two  piles: streetwise jocks and smarter than peepee information transfer  engineers. The girls are different though. It's a funny book which  entertains, snowballs in fractal dimensions while building focus, and also  gave me lots to think and stare off into space about.<br />All through this  book Stephenson draws subtle resolutions of opposites (and conflicts of  complements): fathers and sons coming to discover and appreciate one  another, men and women growing their understanding of each other; coded  chaos becoming luminous, in an everyday way, through the actions taken by  the characters. The prose is fast and bright, and in my opinion this book  basically hits the ground running and builds steam from there.  <br />At its  heart, this book is about extracting information from chaos.  From the  start, I found myself enjoying and liking the characters.  It's  a fast  read if you do as Nils Bohr did and hum through the equations. This is a  clear, well written piece of art which is great in scope and unified in  detail.  Despite its paranoia, it is warmly human.  Just like you and  me.<br />The many typograxial errors mentioned in a previous review _are_ in  fact a code.  I just haven't figured it out yet.  The paper is crappy, and  to cover that up it's got the trendy &quot;deckled quarto&quot; edge or  whatever, I bet it will be yellow and falling apart in 25 years.  But then,  maybe I will be too.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I'm not a big person when it comes down to compilation albums, but Phil's album &quot;Hits&quot; brought 1998 to a venerable close for me.  I'm madly in love with &quot;True Colors&quot;, &quot;Hits'&quot; only new studio  track!  It still has the sentimentality that Cyndi Lauper gave us back in  1986; however, Phil plays it with his trademark upbeat &quot;Nice Guy&quot;  vocals that we've come to love in him.  Aside from this song, I glad that  &quot;Hits&quot; has Phil's three hard-to-find studio classics from 1984:  &quot;Easy Lover&quot;, &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, and &quot;Seperate  Lives&quot;.  Now I have them to listen to anytime I want!  In the long  run, this CD did a pretty good job picking what could be considered the  best songs from &quot;Face Value&quot; (1981) to &quot;Dance Into The  Light&quot; (1996).  However, it would be unfair since all of Phil Collins'  works are truly unique and special in terms of the melodies, lyrics, and  emotions elicited from each listening.  God bless, Phil, and keep on  singing!
079073382X|5.0|I'm pleased to see so many other people are wild about this movie, because it is certainly a wonderful film.  It perfectly and honestly captures the sort of moment life offers on rare, intoxicating occasions.  So many others  have offered insightful commentary I feel the need to agree and leave it at  that.
0792153189|5.0|In 1998's infamous race for the ultimate outer space disaster flick, &quot;Deep Impact&quot; should be bestowed with the gold medal a thousandfold!  Anyone who claims that this magnificent film as sentimental,  nerd-ridden drivel when compared to appallingly lackluster job of  &quot;Armegeddon&quot; must have seriously OD'ed on testosterone or is a  complete mindless pion!  If you fit this description, I truly pity you!  It  is also a sheer travesty that &quot;Armegeddon&quot; received all the Oscar  nominations while &quot;Deep Impact&quot; was left out in the cold!  As big  of a movie buff that I am, I will forever revile the AMPAS and all of its  red-tape politics (the 1999 awards crossed the line for the last time with  me!)  <br />&quot;Deep Impact&quot; puts on the table a first-rate all-star  cast, a superbly written script by Bruce Joel Rubin (&quot;Ghost&quot;),  another terrific score from composer James Horner, and of course fanatstic  CGI effects from Oscar-winning FX grandmaster ILM.  Even without ILM's  handiwork, the performances of Robert Duvall, Elijah Wood, Tea Leoni, and  especially Morgan Freeman are all believably stirring with lucid emotion  and authority.  Freeman as the President would make me pass Clinton up with  his wisdom and empathy for the American people as they face the threat of  international annihilation from the heavens.  His overlooked Oscar-worthy  performance is another reason for me to despise the Academy (who the heck  remembers Ed Harris or Geoffrey Rush's performances in &quot;Truman  Show&quot; and the overpraised &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;  respectively). Finally, one more reason why &quot;Deep Impact&quot; made  its mark forever in heart: EXECUTIVE PRODUCER STEVEN SPIELBERG!  Whether  he's directing or producing, Spielberg never wavers as the all-time  cinematic genius of magical fantasy and of the human spirit.  &quot;Deep  Impact&quot;, coupled with &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;The  Mask of Zorro&quot;, made 1998 a very great year for him.<br />Well, if you  want to squander your brains on a ludicrous 2 1/2 hour, loud-mouthed,  mindless-explosions-every-2-seconds, he-man flick, don't let me stop you  from gourging yourselves on &quot;Armegeddon&quot;!  I tell you, if you've  seen one Bruckheimer/Simpson film, you've basically seem 'em all  (&quot;Crimson Tide&quot;, &quot;The Rock&quot;, &quot;Con Air&quot;,  &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, and &quot;Top Gun&quot; (the only good  one))!  But if you're a sophisticated person who'd like to curl up with an  equally-urbane significant other on a rainy weekend eve, &quot;Deep  Impact&quot; is a masterpiece treat for you!  It will give you hope that in  this blase day &amp; age, Hollywood can still (albeit rarely) create a film  that touches your heart, mind, and soul while simultaneously keeping you on  the edge of your seat.
6303577989|5.0|True mix of Hollywood budgets and European film style.  Both films confront the sensitive side of the English, at war. While not distracting from the incredible surroundings both films manage  to show cultural  differences in a very digestible format.<br />A great set of epics that need  watching over one afternoon, at least twice.
0393317552|3.0|The question is why the West has so much baggage.<br />Diamond then shows that some societies are more lucky than others.  There are only so many types of plants and animals that humans can use.  Thus some socieites in  Africa, the Americas before the Europeans came had a disadvantage.  Then  throw in the Germs and you have a very convincing, well presented  theory.<br />But cultures rise and decline.  What caused Europe to borrow from  others and then achieve a new level of technology?  Other cultures covered  in the book had the same geographical/resource advantages as the Europeans.   So why did the Ottoman Empire with all its advantages, not dominate all of  Europe?<br />Guess there are some things we can never know for sure.  They  just happened.

B00000064E|5.0|How odd, I felt the same way about Nick Drake as the Minnesota reviewer when I first discovered him - he WAS like a new member of the household, and I found myself thinking about him as often as I would an actual friend.   Thats what his music will do to you, haunt you, but in a completely warm,  seductive way, I guanantee you won't want it to end.  Man, who can't be  totally seduced by the asexual sensuality of his voice and playing - listen  to him with headphones and you practically feel his breath on your face. As  I've told many feamale friends, just buy Jeff Buckley's &quot;Grace&quot;  and any Nick Drake album (buy the box set, you'll want them all eventually)  and you'll never need a real boyfriend again.
B000002IZM|4.0|So beautiful it makes me want to cry! Here is a wonderful example of when the music actually ADDS something to a scene, instead of that horrible, what I like to call &quot;formula&quot; music that so many movies use these  days. If I hear another swelling melody a la Jon Williams for an  &quot;emotional&quot; scene, I'm gonna gag.
B000009ED0|5.0|Kid rock has the best type of music. I love rap and i love rock he mixes rap and rock. This CD was really worth the money!!!!
014028009X|5.0|I first listened to this book as a &quot;book on tape&quot; when I got it out of the library.  It was so hysterical and I enjoyed it so much, I ended up buying the hard copy for myself.  While the written work is good, the  book on tape is OUTSTANDING.  The actress who narrates is able to suspend  reality with the use of her voice and make you think that a number of  different people are actually speaking.  I don't usually give 5 stars but  this book is fun.
6305364648|3.0|I'm disappointed that so far none of Fox's titles are anamorphic.  Hopefully Alien Legacy Box will be like they said.
B000009QPG|5.0|This album is the slowest one Slayer has recorded.  It is also the album where Slayer showed their talent as good composers - some tunes are brilliant.  The album is so melodic, but still powerful.  The best thing is  that they stopped head banging on this album, and bothered to record some  music.  Those of you who still look for speed and noise, try something  different.  Using chain saw to cut steel will do.
0684874350|1.0|ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!  This is one of the most depressing, filthy, repetitive, boring books ever to be published.  The people are well aware of their situation of being in poverty yet do nothing to try to better  themseves. They are ignorant, crude, rude and obnoxious - a very poor  example of the true Irish spirit and an insult to anyone from Ireland.   Please -SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BUT THIS BOOK! It isn't even worth one star  and I am sorry I ever read it!
6300183971|5.0|Yes, it is complicated.  Yes, it is difficult to follow.  But in its complexity comes a movie unlike any other.  The amount of vision and imagination it took to create this epic cannot be contained in a 2 hour  movie.  In order to truly appreciate Dune, you have to do your homework and  read the book.  I believe Dune is the ultimate science fiction experience  because Frank Herbert shows us a future that doesn't end up being a perfect  Star Trek episode but rather something that will test our imagination.
B0000024U8|5.0|I first heard this album in the fall of '69 and had to put it on tape after my second album.  Mike Bloomfield is the guitarist I measure all others against and few come close to.  He sits at the top of the heap with  Stevie Ray Vaughn, Kenny Wayne Shepard, Eric Clapton and Carlos Santana.   It is a joy to be able to share appreciation of his talent and music with  my two teenage sons.
0380973464|3.0|Basically, this is an info-novel. I give it 3.5 stars. <br /> I liked this novel.  twice I was laughing so hard tears were rolling down my cheeks (the memo including the pig truck episode was hilarious).  In general, the story  is written in the author's hip, ironic style, we know and love. <br /> The  reason it does not get four stars, is because of Stephenson's hubris.  With  this novel he has become un-editable.  There were pages  and pages of  technical minutia in this story, interesting only to uber-geeks.  I'm  reminded of a textbook exec who said: &quot;Every equation that appears in  a textbook (non-mathematics/physical science) costs 10,000 copies in  sales.&quot;  Stephenson cost himself about 100K copies here.  These  passages added nothing to the story. I ended up rapidly paging though them.   You would think an author savvy enough to write a thriller for a targetted  audience would not have included material like this.  A strong editor could  also have saved on production costs by having it removed. <br /> Finally, the  ending was a bit weak in comparison to the strong beginning and middle.  I  was disappointed that the least developed characters contributed so much to  the novel's conclusion. <br /> Still, I recommend this for Stephenson fans.
0802130208|5.0|I am currently in the midst of reading this thoughtful and humourous novel.  I am an avid reader and am reading other books at the same time.  What I would like to mention is how I came to discover _Confederacy of  Dunces_.  It was mailed to me by a dear friend from Canada.  In a letter  she tells me how much she adores it and how she laughes out loud each time  she re-reads it.  The book was accompanied with a self-portrait photograph  and a wonderful scent within its pages.  Though it hasn't been very often,  everytime I open the books a nostalgic and pleasant smell assaults me and  makes me thinks instantly of the time we spent together.  I love fiction,  and attempt to write myself, but sometimes I have trouble accepting  everyday life.  I am enjoying the read but even more I am enjoying the  momories it envokes.  For if good literature succeeds in reinforcing the  idea of a life-affirming ethics it can be the most gratitfying of all  passions.
6305358613|4.0|Elizabeth is a great movie but it is not what you called a historical movie since it not really based on history. The names are the only historical part and rest is pure fantasy. So I called Elizabeth a  \\"historical fantasy\\" movie. With that in mind, I thought Cate Blanchett was great in this movie and her supporting cast did a superb job. Script had a \\"Godfather\\" feel to it, especially at the end. Don't look to this film for any historical insight. There is none. But for good simple entertainment, the movie is good for that. Otherwise, this is a great Hollywood  film, much like the other \\"historical fantasy\\" film - Braveheart.  Within the context of the film, Elizabeth is one of the best of 1998.
B00000IQCZ|5.0|This film miraculously never dates. It's a gorgeous painting-come-to-life with superb music, rhapsodic acting, costuming, settings and directing.  M-G-M was so meticulous a crew came to St. Louis just to research the  history of the World's Fair and get the details right even if no one  watching the film would know the difference.  The trolley sequence and song  remain one-of-a-kind and July Garland is a miracle.  This film is a gift.  Make it one!
B000002TQB|5.0|This is a really lovely album. Really funny and poppy and oh so lippy and sweet. I couldn't stop listening to it.
0064431789|5.0|I just love this book.  It, along with GOODNIGHT MOON, was my favorite childhood story.  In fact, I even named my son Max, after the main character.  Although he is only 5 weeks old, I have already read it to hime  several times.
B00000IPAX|3.0|For all those that have purchased one of Blinks Cds in the past may or may not be dissapointed. The songs in this Cd have lost most of their Punk edge, but are still good to listen to. If your a hardcore punk fan, get  something from pennywise, mxpx, less than jake, or Living end.

B000002OX7|5.0|I was thirteen years old when the edited 45 of &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; was released in '71.  After an endless barrage of &quot;feel good - love your neighbor - summer of love&quot; anthems on the radio this  one hit like a bolt out of the blue.  Imagine hearing Diana Ross sing  &quot;Baby Love&quot; followed by Tom Jones (I kid you not) singing  &quot;She's a Lady&quot; followed by Roger screaming/pleading to the  heavens that maybe, just maybe, things will be different.  This song got to  the heart of the matter - that peace, love and understanding don't come  easy and you can only hope for the best and fight for your meals.  When the  LP was released it put a cap on the 60's in a way NOBODY could.  From the  man/electronic syncopation of Baba O'Reilly to the all too human isolation  of Behind Blue Eyes to the final bombast of the mini drum solo at the end  of the full blown &quot;Won't Get...&quot; everything works - right down to  the (intentional?) 2001 parody on the cover.  Hey, starchild is Keith  Moon...and living in the trees was not that long ago.
B000005RUX|5.0|Without getting to wordy, It is simply the best album ever. A close second would have to be Vitalogy, but Vitalogy doesn't match the power of songs like Alive and Black.  Long Live Pearl Jam!!!
6304346107|5.0|The British &quot;Emma&quot; is much better than the american. Partly because I hate Gwyneth Palthrow and like Kate Beckinsale, and partly because it's better!
B000007V1I|5.0|This is Megadeth's best album by far. Every single song is very good, including the two bonus tracks. Breakpoint is awesome! A must have for any Megadeth fan
B000001EC1|5.0|Bon Jovi Is The Best, we all now that. The CD Crossroads is a verry good CD, but I don't think those are the best numbers. What do jou think about WILD IS THE WIND of the CD NEW JERSEY. The best number of Bon Jovi is DRY  COUNTY. So this is a tip: Buy the CD of DRY COUNTY, the live number BLOOD  MONEY is a real gooddie. All with all the CD CROSSROAD is a verry good  CD.<br />Greeth from Holland and I hope to see you in the Ntherland John.
B000002JEV|5.0|Both CDs are GREAT! The best Zeppelin CDs I own. This is Led Zep back in the early days. The only bad part about the CDs is that &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; drives you insane after a while. But if you haven't heard  this version of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING  FOR, GO BUY THE CDS ALREADY!!!!
B000003TA4|5.0|than i don't care. But you don't have to spread your ignorant lack of appriciation of music that comes from feeling alone and doesn't need a million impressive guitar solos to have an effect. Kurt is not a great  singer but his voice is full of angst and emotion and if you can't feel it  it's your problem and I feel sorry for you. That was the genious of Kurt,  his songs were not revolutionary from a technical stand point. The catchy  songs are not that original but contains an element that makes them very  relatable. Granted it's not one of the best albums ever. Kurt even said  himself that it just came along at the right time. It's probably not even  the best nirvana cd. But just cause smells like teen spirit was over played  and had a not that original riff, it doesn't mean that the atmosphere of  this song didn't make it something entirley of it's own kind. Other songs  like Breed, Drain You, Lithium and On a plain carry this same magic that  will make nirvana much more than a passing fad. So stop trying to analyze  this music, just feel it. Just cause Nirvana took up a lot of credit that  should of gone to other bands (I'll admit it, they did) it doesn't mean  that they weren't a great band themselves.
B00000IQMT|4.0|This is one great classical score. I should know its the only kind of music that I listen to. The tracks are full of energy and magic, but only if you play them in the order they are in the movie and not the order on  the soundtrack itself. Sony gets an &quot;F&quot; for presentation and for  limiting the music to seventy-five minutes when the music doesn't stop in  the movie and the movie is over two hours long.  But on the music itself  its fantasic, but I did wish that Mr. Williams had included a little more  of the familiar themes as well.  The Jedi theme itself was one of energy  and action that no one only associated with Luke and could have been  utilized for dramatic portions here.  This would have helped to link the  movies more and quench our thirst for some familiarity.  The few cues from  the original movies that are present help to forshadow events and add to  the storytelling.  &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; &quot;Anakin's theme&quot;  and &quot;Captain Panaka and the queen's protectors&quot; are by far the  best of the album.
0156528207|5.0|There is no need for all the fancy new language techniques to &quot;spice&quot; up prose. People should look to the dazzling simplicity and spare beauty of The Little Prince. It's a magical, almost religious  book about a strange visitor from a another planet who befriends the  narrator, a fallen pilot. There are wonderful encounters and memorable  scenes in the book (accompanied by fanciful illustrations by St. Exupery  himself) that cut to the bone of meaning and touch the heart. The prince's  farewell to the fox is my personal favourite. The Little Prince is an  awe-inspiring, uplifting book.

0030853222|1.0|Apparently Dee Brown thought the sufferings of 19th-century American Indians weren't ghastly enough to impress hippie readers back in the Age of Aquarius, so he proceeds to fake things.  Brown doesn't merely  &quot;slant&quot; things to a degree that amounts to a hallucinatory  experience, but makes things up outright.  Anxious to make G.A. Custer look  bad for the Washita attack, he invents casualty figures, claiming that  Custer killed 103 Cheyennes, only eleven of whom were men!  (As  anthropologist John Greenway observed, massacres of Indians, in the  neononsense of Brown and his associates, are not indiscriminate, but  rigorously discriminate, consisting solely of women and children.)  Brown  either covers up Indian atrocities (particularly those of the Apaches) or  tries to lie his way out of them by providing some bogus excuse; according  to him, the Sioux's Minnesota massacre of some 400 white settlers one fine  day in 1862 simply never happened.<br />He can't even get the small parts  right, even depicting Custer's men as carrying sabers at the Little  Bighorn.  One can find out nothing about the American Indians of the West  from reading Brown's book, perhaps because he's not really interested in  them save as victims for his guilt-stricken white readership.<br />As for  Brown's claim that his book is an &quot;Indian history,&quot; based on  Indian accounts gathered at treaty councils or immured in obscure  government documents, this is but another falsehood.  He could have written  the thing in two weeks, ripping off standard books in print -- including  Custer's memoir &quot;My Life on the Plains&quot;!  No original research  was involved.
0393317552|5.0|I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I do agree with some of the previous reviews about the author repeating some ideas to many times. Also, would the statement about New Guineans being on the average more  intelligent than Europeans qualify as a racist remark?  On a more serious  note, several other reviewers compare the book with Landes' Wealth &amp;  Poverty of Nations `. I think both books complement each other well. The  geographical and ecological factors that Diamond weaves so well to support  his ideas began mattering less and less as mankind's technological  capabilities grew. Then a paradigm shift took place and the factors  discussed in the Landes ( culture, government, policy, etc.) book began  determining success. In my view Diamond explains human history from BC  12000 to AD 1300-1400, Landes after this date. This would  explain why  different European countries of similar backgrounds fared so differently  after 1500 AD. Any ideas anyone on what the next paradigm shift will bring?  Although I recommend it the Landes book also has several anoying things but  that is another story.
B000002KNY|5.0|&quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food is incomparable&quot;, but Fear of Music ranks as the Heads'second-best album.  &quot;Cities&quot; is perhaps my favorite dance tune ever, and &quot;Heaven&quot;, &quot;Memories  Can't Wait&quot;, and &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; are all classics.   This album, however, is not as consistent as &quot;Buildings and  Food.&quot;  Also, the juxtaposition of tunes sometimes seems odd.<br />Highly  recommended, but &quot;Buildings and Food&quot; is a better choice for  someone looking to buy their first Heads album.
B000003TA4|5.0|From the moment you first hear this CD you will be blown away.  You will never listin to music the same way again.

0871137380|5.0|From the beginning, this new found information was hard hitting, I could not put the book down. A must read for the military and recommended for politicians every where. God Bless you Rangers, thanks for your sacrifice.  &quot; Freedom has a flavor that the protected shall never know&quot;.
0780625129|4.0|Absolutely excellent, Kaye's ( or actually from what I heard Norton's) film is very harsh and at times very violent, yet never for a moment loses its humanity and impartuality. The main protagonists themselves, despite  their obvious social misunderstandings, are very sympathetic and are  likable to the audience. It is this quality that helps gel the movie during  sometimes cliched situations. Overall the film has a very semi  documentary/&quot;Cops&quot; type of cinematography which is at times  breathtaking.
6300216365|5.0|This is my all time favorite Allen film.  If you have seen Casablanca more than 10 times in your lifetime, this movie is a must.  I couldn't stop laughing at Allen's little quirks and references to bogey.  I think this is  Allen's most underrated film.
0670880728|3.0|My God! Bridget Jones, a life of a women traced into a steps of mirror, we are actually following a woman of the nineties? I believe women ay shrugged but it is, so stereotypical! They are the anti-tradition, they are the new  hip-hop and sex crazy Goddess... My...my Bridget Jones really brightens up  my day with the humour cast upon the creative skills of Helen Fieldings,  well, this is a shot of good book, I call this a great book not a literary  exceptional book, a good thought for a life of laughter...
B0000048V8|5.0|In a world where big, loud and violent seems to be the popular trend with children, I was most impressed by the way this movie captivates all who are within hearing distance of it.  Also I was suprised at my yound five year  old sons immediate &quot;hands downs&quot; choice of this movie over all  other videos.  It is true quality and a movie for which parents do not have  to worry about overall content or story line.  It is simple and for many,  may be the first example of true hand art and symphonic music perfectly  blended together.  GREAT JOB, WE NEED MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS! Put this one  on without introduction and just observe the way it captures your childrens  imagination.  Even though it is typically a story centered around the  Winter/Christmas time of year it is viewed by all of us all year.
080018355X|1.0|Considering the incredible talent and financial resources that went into the production of this film, it is astonishingly atrocious. The usually wonderful Sean Connery does King Arthur as a wimp, while Richard Gere is  totally miscast as a 90's hero in the Middle Ages.  With all the research  available in Medieval Clothing, the costumes are more appropriate for Star  Trek.  The Production design is equally anachronistic.  Ben Cross's band of  evil doers handle their pistol crossbows (non-existent in the period) as if  they were semi-automatic pistols.  Merlin is nowhere to be found.  Even  Bing Crosby's &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot; seems  more historically accurate, and in touch with human truths.
0452273331|5.0|A friend loves this book so much he got a tattoo related to it.  I thought, that's a good enough reason to read it.  At times I thought it was too long and wordy, but the minute I finished it, I realized it could not  have been written any other way.  Read it - each word, cover to cover.  You  won't regret it.
0790740443|5.0|This movie showed a subtlety rarely found in American films and almost never in the sci-fi, action catagory. Russel delivered a masterful performance as the disassociated soldier coming into self awareness. The  fact that he did not speak many line added rather than subtracted from the  emotional content of the film.
B000005E60|5.0|This piece put Berio's name on the map. The young Italian composer was invited to New York metropolis to conduct this in the late Sixties, and his reputation hasn't looked back since. The work was well played in Europe but  was a claw in the throats of institutionalized orchestral corridors here.  It has only been the last ten years where we have heard this 20th century  masterwork with any degree of frequency. And I don't know why. Berio's  musical language is the most accessible around,with a direct emphasis on  facile textures and points of density, as well as adapting images and  conceptions from the current buzz for vocal materials, as Martin Luther  King,the Sixties graffitti,and Claude-Levi Strauss. If anyone remembers  this work it is the collage-container movement &quot;In ruhig Fliessender  Bewegung&quot;,where Berio seamed,stitched and pasted objects from the  edifice of musical repertoire with burdened emphasis on the late Romantics  Strauss,Bruckner and especially Mahler. This movement utilizing the  St-Anthony's preaching to the fish with the Bruckner &quot;Fourth  Symphony&quot; is indeed memorable and wisked you away into self-conscious  unreality. The initital plan was to use a laundry list of classics, and he  did Debussy,Stravinsky,Stockhausen and Boulez even all made it,but the  Catania Library in Sicily where he wrote this movement had limited  resources. The various vocalists here who recite and sing are always a  powerful point as the overly self-conscious quips coming from a male voice.  &quot;I think I will recite my poetry now&quot; Thank you Mr. Boulez&quot;  A heightened hype was part of Berio's solidarity with the energy that was  in the air in the late Sixties. Boulez places these vocalists within the  orchestra so to absorb them into the texture as opposed to having them  inhabit the front of the orchestra. This is indeed a precise  interpretation. Boulez knows this work and admires Berio's music perhaps  more than any other Italian, including Verdi.The work has not weathered  itself well, and you feel the date and the times.Berio was the analytic  experimentor,hip with the times(,he helped the Beatles in the studio), He  is and was a master orchestrator,learning and finding a voice, a not  altogether easy task coming from the relative cultural poverty that was  part of Italy after the war. Still&quot;Sinfonia&quot; it was a high point  in the history of music.
1881273156|5.0|The 5 Love Languages is the best book on relationships I have ever read.  It should be mandatory reading for every couple and not only will it help or save your marriage but it will also help you understand your parents and  how they expressed love to you as a child.

B000002C1X|5.0|I'm not claiming this is Floyd's best album, but when it first came out, I kicked back, put on the earphones, and was absolutely stunned by Water's lyrics and Gilmore's &quot;crying&quot; guitar. It was de ja vue all over  again when the CD came out. I can understand someone who is not a Floyd fan  not likeing this album, but if your into Floyd, it's a must.
0767800958|1.0|The movie moves really slow. Don't expect a fast-paced movie like other dance movies that have come out in recent years. The whole movie can be seen,told and understood in the 5 minute music video of  &quot;Libertango&quot; by Yo-Yo Ma. (see official site of this movie for  video clip)
B000001F7R|4.0|This is a hot record! One of the first albums I ever bought. The production is not up to the Pyromania standards, but there's more variety. As short as Pete Willis was, he sure could rock. Also, you can actually  hear Rick Savage's bass playing... Produced by Tom Allom in the Priest  tradition. Too bad they got so weak later on...
6302994063|5.0|Once was not enough. I had to own a copy of the movie and watch the screen sizzle as Scott and Fran danced through the movie over and over again! They had GREAT chemistry together!!<br />There are LOTS of memorable scenes and  music in the movie (Fran &amp; Scott's dance on the rooftop, romantic dance  backstage, and Paso Doble just to name a few...)  I would like to see more  of these type of movies made.<br />You will not be disappointed!

014028009X|5.0|My mother gave me this book when we were on vacation together in Germany.  She was laughing so hard while reading it I asked her to give it to me when she was finished.  <br />Bridget Jone's is a 30-something woman living in  London who keeps track of her life via her diary.  She starts every day by  counting her weight, alcohol units, cigarettes, lottery ticket purchases,  obsessive calls to voice mail account to see if men have called, etc.  This  book is a total hoot!  Especially for single women in their 30's who can  relate.  I found myself nodding my head &quot;yes&quot; to many of her  pages as I had experienced similar things in my life.  It is good, light  reading that will give you many laughs!  I hope Fielding will write  another!
B000002UB3|5.0|Forget the ill-conceived &quot;Let It Be&quot; album.  This was the Beatles' last album and it has to be said that Liverpool's most famous sons certainly knew how to make a fine rock record.  This 1969 album is no  exception.  For many people, this is their fave Beatles record although I  would rate &quot;Abbey Road&quot; their second best album (&quot;Sgt  Pepper&quot; being their undisputed best album).  If you already own  &quot;Pepper&quot; then this album should be next on your list.  It is a  thoroughly entertaining listen and it's amazing to think that a band could  make an album as good as this whilst on the verge of splitting up.  The  much-discussed segued sequence on Side 2 (if you are listening to the vinyl  that is; for CD listeners this is the latter part of the album) is an  absolute joy.  You either love it or you hate it.  Me personally, I love  it!  Best song for me has to be the opener, Lennon's classic moody rocker  &quot;Come Together&quot;.  This is closely followed by George Harrison's  two offerings, &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot;,  which are easily the best songs he wrote as a Beatle.  It's a crying shame  they after this record was made but what a way to go out.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This album rocks.  It has a slightly different sound than Dude Ranch, but it still has all the catchy hooks and funny lyrics as Dude Ranch.  Dumpweed is a great song, as well as What's My Age Again.  Definitely get this.
B000002JSV|5.0|The best of AC/DC right here!  There is no other album I have that I can listen to the whole thing straight through and love every song!  This and Highway to Hell are staples of any classic rock fan!
0517122707|5.0|I have come to the sad conclusion that those who fail to see the humor in Toole's masterpiece are seriously lacking the genetic components which enable a human being to laugh. Yet, one individual's taste(or lack of  taste) in comedy can be forgiven. What can't be so easily forgiven is the  dismissal of Toole's writing ability. To say that Toole's writing is  amateurish displays a questionable ability to discern quality. &quot;A  Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is magnificent; almost unanimous raves and a  Pulitzer Prize are hardly negligible affirmations of this. Toole was indeed  a Maestro.
0671027344|5.0|i didn't get all of the points in this book, but it's still the best book i've ever read.  i admit i'm only a 7th grader, and i can't relate with all of the high school issues, but it's interesting to read what goes on.   charlie is really sweet.  i wish i knew someone like him!
014028009X|1.0|I found this so pathetic. I realize that I am in the minority on this one, still, I though I'd share my views. I really didn't want to hear about another person's whiny obsessions with dieting, bad boy friends and parents  (which is essentially what the book is). I have plenty of friends who do  that all day. The only good thing here was that it was a book and I could  slam it shut.
B00000IQMT|3.0|The CD is quite dull, and Lucas is to blame, not Williams.  Lucas didn't develop characters at all in Phantom, so Williams had precious little to cling to when trying to develop compelling musical themes for each  character the way he did in the originals.  If the movie was a parody of  the original Star Wars and a rude joke that Lucas has played on real Star  Wars fans, Williams did the best he could to make the CD half respectable.   I'm not expecting anything else worthwhile to come out of the  Lucas/Williams collaboration.
0679428887|2.0|i read fatherland and thought it was a very entertaining and involving book.  this book was convoluted, the characters were hard to follow, and ultimately the story was not that interesting.  there are too many books  out there to waste your time with this one.  i am annoyed with myself for  finishing it.
B000006IUQ|5.0|Lee Tamahori is a great director. Up to this film I had never heard of him before. Maybe he has directed other movies, but since I am not that much of a movie buff I really wouldn't know. There was one problem with the film,  though. The fact it had scenes with bears in it. That alone is already  enough to leave my heart pounding, because I am really scared to death of  them. The soundtrack provided by Jerry Goldsmith(who's works include the  masterful satanic pieces found in &quot;The Omen&quot;) also helps to  instill the fear in the viewer. It grabs your attention from the first  moment and doesn't let go! Great film!
6304698658|5.0|This is one of my favortie stupid, but funny movies.  Add it to your collection and play it for your friends during the holidays.  It should keep you laughing during an otherwise stressful time.
B000003CKH|4.0|I requested and danced to RCYY at my 40th birthday &quot;luau&quot; bash wearing a lei.  I truly did enjoy this album.  As an aside, shouldn't &quot;Never There&quot; from album #3 be at least 10 minutes long?<br />P.S.   What would Geggy Tah do in the Land Of Race Car Ya-yas?
6304913176|4.0|If you're looking for some great effects, awesome monstruous and ferocious space bugs, good-to-terrific-looking (bad) actors, and a futuristic view with great doses of cynicism and humour, then &quot;Troopers&quot; is great  fun. I'm 25 and I know I have to accept that all action movies are designed  to satisfy the mind of a 15-year-old (even if the young dudes aren't  allowed to watch the gore-fest in the theater), so I didn't ask no  questions about the stupidity of the military tactics, the  spaceship-destroyer bug spit, how the irrational (with the exception of the  brainy big fat one) alien bugs sent an asteroid to earth and about so many  other laughable things in the plot. I just accepted the absurd but highly  enjoyable universe of &quot;Troopers&quot; the way it was and I had a great  time! I can't give 5 stars because that is the rating of the great serious  movies of sci-fi, like 2001 and Solaris. &quot;Troopers&quot; is a guilty  pleasure! Don't take it seriously and let it rock!
B000002O4S|3.0|The wordy music was OK, but the OUTATIME orchestra in tracks three and Six were amazing.
B00000I8UE|5.0|Yes, I sound like a Cassandra nut, however, this recording is the reason why.  The arrangements are fascinating (particularly the Cindi Lauper cover &quot;Time After Time&quot; - I know what you're thinking, but give it a  chance!), the performances are incredible, and the album still suprises and  delights after countless listens.  For best result, turn it right up and be  immersed in Cassandra's smoky vocals and the intricate arrangements.  Truly  a remarkable album, and one which, in my opinion, soars well and truly over  it's intention as a kind of tribute to Miles Davis.  Just buy it and listen  - you will not be disappointed.
0375701427|2.0|Don DeLillo's UNDERWORLD--the best novel written by an American since Faulkner died--was shut out for the Pulitzer Prize by Philip Roth's tragedy of a star athlete, star businessman, Marine drill instructor and  assimilated Jew nonpareil whose  American dream unravels before his eyes.  Swede Levov--a golden-haired Jewish prince who's a legend to his  high-school classmates--has assembled his life in perfect order. He marries  a former Miss New Jersey; runs his dad's glove business; and raises an at  first lovely daughter, named, with top-heavy irony, Merry. But one fine day  sixteen years after her birth, the stuttering, unpacifiable Merry protests  the Vietnam War by planting a bomb in a small-town post office; and the  Swede's descent is positively Sophoclean.The pathos in AMERICAN PASTORAL is  Ibsen by way of Arthur Miller; and the sobersided moralism of DEATH OF A  SALESMAN weighs heavily on every page of this long, baleful novel. Roth's  antic, hectoring voice is in evidence, but it's stuffed into the mouth of  the Swede, whose torrential commentary all amounts to &quot;But why? Why  me?&quot; The answer--strangely parallel to the conceit of Rick Moody's THE  ICE STORM--seems to be that the Lord has punished the Swede for pride: in  thinking that he could be a good, might-as-well-be-gentile American, the  Swede brings suffering down on his head. Roth even has Swede's arrogant,  brilliant, wholly combative brother (who do you think he's based on?)  deliver the moral for pages on end: The Swede always did the  &quot;right&quot; thing, made everybody happy, never made a fuss, and now  look at you!Better Ariel Sharon than Harvey Milquetoast, seems to be  Jerry's--and Roth's--point. Or, to put it more coarsely, better to be a  disruptive, disreputable Jew than a Jew who thinks the gentiles are his  friend--because wait till you see what they have in store for you! (The  Levovs' neighbors, a plaid-pants philanderer and an aging tippler, are like  an unsmilingly intended version of what Lenny Bruce's parents think  Gentiles to be.) Within its limited scope, Roth pulls off amazing  feats--the book is like a Pulitzer-calibre streak of talk-radio rant. But  its limitations grow more and more exposed as the book goes on, chief among  the conception of the goddess-of-discord daughter. Roth gets very well  inside the head of the Swede, his decency and dismay, but can't imagine  Merry as anything but a spiteful, sociopathic poser, copping any attitude  to cause her parents life-shattering grief. But what if she really believed  this stuff? What if it meant something to her, other than as a way of  thumbing her nose at her parents and their world? Roth can't empathize his  way into her head; more shockingly, it doesn't seem to occur to him to try.  The daughter becomes an emblem of what these kids are coming to. (An entire  chapter is devoted to a morally outraged discussion of teenagers watching  DEEP THROAT.) And Roth pulls a terrible rabbit out of his hat near the  end--he tries on the possibility that the Levov family nightmare was caused  by the Swede's marrying a shikse! This is the schism that makes a character  kill four people. Leave it to Philip Roth to recap the American century by  characterizing the nation's deepest rift as...the misunderstanding between  Gentiles and Jews? Like Woody Allen, who has begun heisting plot elements  from Roth's recent novels, Roth seems in need of a trip outside his own  circumscribed world. Maybe then his novels will earn a caption  wider-reaching than his current &quot;Why me, o Lord, why me?&quot;
6300216268|5.0|Along with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, this is the best movie ever made. I just don't understand that, if it's a cult film, why haven't they made a soundtrack?!?

630471288X|5.0|I have &quot;experienced&quot; this movie about 10 times on VHS, and I laugh, cry and fall more in love with this movie with every viewing.  While some movies lack in certain catagories, Shawshank Redemption is perfectly  written and directed, the casting is perfect, the acting is perfect, the  cinematography is perfect and any other catagory I am forgetting is  perfect.  Ask anyone who has seen the movie, and the worst response you  will ever get is &quot;that was a very good movie!&quot;<br />Now I know  Loenard Maltin is a complete moron!  If ANY of the movie was cut out, you  would not fully enjoy every hidden meaning.  Believe me, If a movie EVER  wrapped up in a perfect ball, this would be it!<br />I have over 100 DVD's in  my collection, and my collection is nothing without Shawshank Redemption  (or Braveheart for that matter)!<br />I am going to pre-order now and hope  that this is not just another damn rumor! ;o)  Do yourself a favor, and go  rent it now and buy it later so you can watch it whenever you want to smile  from head to toe!

6301543408|5.0|After the wonderful Voyage Home, the trek crew engaged in the most light-hearted movies of the series.  I personally believe it is the best \\"long episode\\" there is.  Who cares who directed it, it was a good story and at the heart of Star Trek itself, not one of the other movies examined the relationships of the crew like this one.  And so it gets five stars for the movie and subjects it covered, not for being a \\"superb\\" sci-fi flick.
B000002N9L|5.0|This is truly a mess. And that's great. It seems that Prince, or whatever, cares not much about this one. The effect is unexpectedly great.It really rocks. He is really angry.

B000001FS3|4.0|Monumental sell-out, or the Coming of Rock's New Messiahs? (watch 'em part those sand dunes!) Semi-Biblical posturing claptrap, or an album of rare and enduring spirituality? The last good album U2 made - or the first? And  why it is apparently illegal to smile in the middle of the desert? All  these questions are yours to answer (except maybe the last one) when you  get your hands on 'The Joshua Tree' - an album that sees the four lads from  Dublin paying homage to the spirit of a land that is as alien to them as  Mars. And yet when they pull it off, it seems, against all the odds,  authentic, profound and original.<br />It's easy to dismiss a singer whose  voice and causes are as earnest as Bono's on this album, yet  when he sings  'I believe / In Kingdom Come / Then all the colours / Will bleed into one /  Bleed into one' he carries you with him. The standard of songwriting  throughout the album is high, and the Edge contributes varied guitar  textures on many of the tracks that make the whole album a rich listening  experience. Two songs, in particular, have been almost worn off my cassette  - the achingly beautiful ballad 'Running To Stand Still' and the rousing  gospel of 'One Tree Hill'. (I've never quite liked 'With or Without You'  but I think that was due to overexposure on the radio.) Borrowed though  their influences were (and that's not necessarily a criticism of the music)  U2 forged a truly remarkable album in the Joshua Tree (and to answer my own  question, I believe that nothing they've done since has lived up to it.)  <br />Honesty. Passion. Great songs. And really, really serious facial  expressions. The Joshua Tree has them all. Drink up, gentlemen. You deserve  it, Begorrah.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Sarah Brightman has a magnificent voice and this CD ably demonstrates her talent. The version of the Titanic theme in italian shows the quality of her voice over Celine Dion. In the Dion recording, you can hear her intake  of breath before each phrase. This does not occur with a professional like  Sarah Brightman.
B000003BF4|5.0|After listening to the incredible opening number, &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash&quot;, I knew this was going to be a good one. Mick should have this much energy when he sings today. &quot;Sympathy&quot;, &quot;Midnight  Rambler&quot;, and &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; are definitely the best  numbers on the album next to &quot;Jumpin' Jack&quot;.
0061092037|4.0|Jeffrey Archer is a master of the short story with a twist.  This novel seems to be a number of short stories connected together in the guise of a full-length novel.  And thus it loses the elements that could have made it  a classic.  In addition, it seems that most people who have negative  comments on this book, are comparing it to &quot;Kane and Able.&quot;  I  confess to not having read that book (although I plan to soon) but have  read many other Archer stories/novels.  This entry is a good read but Mr.  Archer misses the mark when he fails to keep the reader rooting for the  main characters.  As the novel begins, we are introduced to the two main  characters and come to understand that they each have fatal flaws.  We know  from the beginning that they won't grow up to be likable characters and yet  we hope to understand their view points.  Instead I ended up hoping they  would both drop off the end of the earth.  I would refer uninitiated  readers to Archer's, &quot;As the Crow Flies,&quot; for the ultimate  &quot;good read.&quot;
B000000W5L|5.0|&quot;Exile&quot; is definitely the best Stones album. Tunes like &quot;Rocks Off&quot;, &quot;Rip this Joint&quot;, &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;, &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot;, and &quot;Happy&quot; are simply  classic. Now, why won't they return to their blues roots and record an  album like this now?
B0000009S3|5.0|This is a great CD I recomend it to anyone who likes jazz/rock fusion.  Peaches En Regalia is a classic.  Willie the Pimp and Son of Mr. Green Jeans are also excellent songs.
0790729628|5.0|I recently bought a DVD player and this was one of the first DVDs on my wish list.  I really like the director's cut of this film and the DVD version is much better than the VHS DirCut. This is a really great film.
B000002MFN|5.0|The grooves this album has is fantastic!Erotica and Bad Girl are my personal favorites because thy are so stylish but the entire album is great!
0688156819|5.0|hilarious &amp; zany, with a stylish cloth cove
B00000IP3S|5.0|When I first heard the CD, I couldn't stop listening to it! It was the only Disc in my player for about two weeks.finally, it is available as a Domesticrelease, so I urge all Heavy metal fans to check it out! No angry  hardcore here, but lots of super melodic, and fast songs with lyrics that  pay tribute to the power of human imagination
1573225517|5.0|This is definitely on my &quot;top five&quot; list! Being approximately Rob's age and a pop-rock fanatic since 1964, he hit the nail on the head. I thought I wasn't going to like it at first, but, OH MY. Well, I can't do it  in order, but here's my top five: Searching for Caleb (Anne Tyler) Harriet  The Spy (Louise Fitzhugh) The Time Garden (Edward Eager) Operating  Instructions (Anne Lamotte) High Fidelity (NH)<br />Thanks to my ex-husband  who practically held it in front of me until I opened it!
B00000ICD9|3.0|This story is cliche ridden garbage.  What saves this movie are the amazing visuals that manage to create this fantastic world.  For that reason alone, it is worth a look.  It takes you somewhere you've never been  before.
6305177473|2.0|It was easy for the producers to make this movie: they already had a script. If they wanted to compete with the old Parent Trap, they should have changed the plot. The plot is believable &amp; real, but the acting  was poor. Lindsay Lohan has talent, but Elaine Hendrix, Dennis Quaid, &amp;  Natasha Richerdson obviously didn't study the script enough. <br />Dennis  Quaid (Nicholas Parker) needed to have more heart when dumping Elaine  Hendrix (Meredith Blake). Natasha Richardson was too stiff.<br />But Lisa Ann  Walter &amp; Simon Kunz added a comical glimpse to the movie. In  conclusion, the old Parent Trap had more talent, originality, &amp; acting.
6305372411|5.0|It could have been Mars, the North Pole or even a more obscure corner of our universe. The most important point about this series is the HUMAN aspect of this magnificent effort, from the most humble shop-floor worker  to the great minds behind such a huge achievement. Congratulations to Tom  Hanks, HBO and their crew for such a good job!
6304779259|5.0|Recently checked this out over the weekend, prepared to merely re-watch an old favorite-but boy, is there a lot of cool &quot;add ons&quot; in this version made for DVD! First of all, the film comes letterboxed-only (some  people like having the choice, but if you've seen this in a movie theater,  you notice a LOT of stuff cut off at the edges by &quot;blowing it up&quot;  to full screen), a walk through commentary by legendary puppeteer (voice of  ms. piggy/grover) turned director-Frank Oz that lends a humourous and  insightful (if sometimes technical)overview from the one guy most qualified  to talk about its behind the scenes trials and tribualations. You'll be  surprised at just how much work and planning really went into it.  And,  best of all-the legendary original ending! Yes, it's true, the off-broadway  musical (and even the Corman B-movie original) had a VERY different ending.  This is where Oz's comments come in particularly handy as first hand guide  to the very tough decisions a filmaker has to make regarding his work if  the people paying for it ultimately call the shots. So why is it not  available? Well, turns out the lost ending footage is owned by producer  David Geffen, who did not clear or approve its inclusion on the disc. Could  be because presented with another choice, fans of this movie may agree with  Oz (and screenwriter Howard Ashman, who died in 1991) on the original  ending having a much greater impact.  So if you can find this disc, by all  means check it out!
B000005RZ4|5.0|i first this stuff while spending the summer on a beach near pisa, italy.  it still sounds good in 1999, 11 years later.  these guys are worth one cd, but thats it.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I was fortunate enough to get an advance order of Dido's debut album, &quot;No Angel,&quot; and frankly, it took me away.  This album is excellent, period.  I would give this four and a half stars if I have the  option to.  What is remarkable about Dido is her ability to combine her  classical and electronic influences, weaved with her lush McLachlan-like  vocals to generate an innovative, refreshing new sound.  &quot;Here With  Me&quot; (track 1) is a grand pop symphony that immediately engages you  into her sound.  &quot;Thank You&quot; (track 6) , also featured on the  &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; soundtrack, is my favorite track.  It's just a  nice acoustic melody that's pleasant to the ears.  &quot;Honestly OK&quot;  (track 7) may be the most progressive track.  The beginning sounds like The  Orb's &quot;Fluffy Little Clouds,&quot; but once Dido's vocals weaves  through, you're taken back down from the stratosphere.  If radio stations  catch on to Dido's first single, &quot;Here With Me&quot; - watch out, she  may be the next big thing.
B00000IQMT|5.0|John Williams has done it again.  He is one of the  greatest composers/directors of all time.  It's to bad the music comminity and the rest of us will never realize this until he has left this world and become  one with the force.
6305120706|5.0|This was a made for video production. I liked the fact that it was not done in front of an audiance. Riverdance II and Lord of the Dance are great but the noise and sounds comming from the audiance are a distraction in  parts. With Cats you have none of that pure clear video and crisp clean  sound. I hope someone comes out with more musicals like this one. You can't  go wrong with this DVD.
B000002MZ9|5.0|I think Neil Young is the greatest artist of all time. All of his albums I own and consider my most valuable items.  I have countless favorite song's of his.  It wasn't until  I heard &quot;I'm The Ocean&quot; did I finally  the greatest song ever written.  A six minute song that guides you through  a beatiful story of life.  It helped me better understand myself to anyone  who want's to hear real music I recommened purchasing any Neil Young album.
B000002LTU|5.0|Yes, this album is an outstanding one! My deep respect for the man with the horn for his last courageously experiment. Unfortunately the last time that Miles was able to went to another cool place of his music and  therefore Doo-Bop is already a classic. Miles intelligent mix of jazz and  hip-hop I never heard before and after. It's a shame that he had to go.
068484267X|5.0|Powerful! A true tale to lead a person in appreciating the life they have had.  Well written and the pictures painted by his words are clear.  I wanted to reach out to his mother and hold her hand.  If I can be half as  strong as her for my son I'd be thrilled.
B00000I924|5.0|For all his jaw-dropping axe wizardry, the legendary Mr. Beck has had the Devil's Own Time producing solid albums. Only a precious few--&quot;Blow by Blow&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot;--have consistently captured his unique  brilliance.&quot;Who Else!&quot; belongs in that hallowed company. This is  an 11-song tour de force of rock, blues, and techno instrumentals that will  surely melt your hearing aid. The live cut &quot;Brush With The Blues&quot;  ranks with his screams-to-sighs treatment of &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie  Hat&quot; (on &quot;Wired&quot;) as a PRIME EXAMPLE of Beck at his best. No  one wrings tortured notes out of a stratocaster with such stunning fluidity  and amazing grace. Couple that ability with a plate of solid tunes (often  in short supply on albums past) and you got yourself one hellaciously fine  disc. Here's the proof.
B000002LN9|5.0|... the track for me is &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;.  It's the theme from a brilliant BBC TV drama from the eighties starring, amongst others, Bob Peck and Joe Don Baker, if I remember correctly.  A stunning piece that  sends shivers down my spine *every* time I play it and makes me turn the  volume all the way up to a foundation-shaking 10.<br />I haven't seen Clapton  live since the Journeyman tour but that was a great gig; a stripped-down  band with Phil Collins on drums (and a stunning vocal on &quot;Can't Find  My Way Home&quot;).  That was around the time this album came out so the  memories may leave me biased when it comes to awarding this album 5  stars.<br />Great album!
0784011370|5.0|First Blood is one of the ultimates in action.  John Rambo is pitted against a small Army, with Brian Dennehy leading the attack.  Some the best acting by all involved takes place in a film where one is forced to fight  against incredible odds.If your a Stallone fan, and haven't yet seen it,  First Blood is highly recommended.
B000002AGE|5.0|PART 1: If you've never heard this, just buy it - just buy it - I guarantee you'll be glad. Well, everyone else has said it before. This is just one of the most wonderful experiences you can have listening to music.  It's that simple. After years of hearing it on vinyl, I bought the CD,  listened closely to Havona (wow), Teen Town (so damn cool), and A Remark  You Made (I was truly moved, it's like a jazz ballad from deep space, there  will never be another as beautiful). Joe is sublime, Wayne is a voice of  sadness, and Jaco is just plain genius (Acuna ain't half bad, either, just  right). If you've never heard this, just buy it - just buy it - I guarantee  you'll be glad.<br />PART 2: HOWEVER, I MUST ECHO THE OTHER REVIEW...WHY IN  THE WORLD IS PALLADIUM CUT OFF????? WHAT IN THE H&amp;*^ HAPPENED? HAS  ANYONE EVER REALLY CHALLENGED COLUMBIA ON THIS? Someone, let me know - I  want a corrected copy, somehow - you can't just do that to this album...for  cripes sakes, I bet all of the re-releases of Disco Hits and such didn't  just cut songs off...anybody have a clue?
B00000IPAX|5.0|I cannot wait anymore for this album to come out. I've heard four songs from it and they are all great. If you are like me and have been a blink fan for a while or are just starting out then get this one when it comes  out because so far it's great.
014028009X|5.0|This is a most amusing book - and I challenge every woman who reads it to not identify with Bridget in some small way - even if it horrifies you to admit it!  Take this for what it is, an enormously entertaining read!
0375707972|3.0|One of the things that I admire most about Oprah and her Book Club selections is that she is exposing followers to such a wide range of literary styles. This is not a book for everyone. The characters are hard  to sympathize with and the writing has a staccato, abrupt feel. Frankly, I  didn't enjoy it. However, I did find it extremely well-written, exploring  some intriguing themes about relationships; about the mesmerizing effects a  first sexual partner can imprint on you for a lifetime; about pride,  pragmatism and their sometimes horrifying consequences; and about post-WWII  Germans growing up in the aftermath of their country's shame. It's a quick  read--you may not fall in love with it, but it's worth a try, because you  might enjoy the insights the author provides.
B0000087GT|5.0|I have based alot of my music around soul. In the day it was alot of Motown / Stevie / Gospel.... But never, has an artist been so influential to me than this cat! Kia kaha Cuz, all the way
B0000035GN|2.0|...if you are a cheesey college student alterna-rocker wannabe than this album is for you. If you are a loyal and dedicated Sebadoh fan then you will find nothing interesting on this album. Eric Gaffney is gone, and so  is the sound that made me a Sebadoh fan. This is a bunch of guys on the  verge of selling out big-time. Although, i must say &quot;Magnets  Coil&quot; rocks!!! and so does &quot;Dramamine&quot;. But after that, you  just kinda gotta search around the disc for the good songs. Everything else  is pure boredom.
1564029654|5.0|This book is a one of the most beautiful childrens books I've ever come across. It is a must for any working mom who has to leave her little owlets alnoe every once in a while, and wants them to know, that just like the owl  mother in the story, she will always come back. This touching story comes  alive with simple rhymes and amazing illlustrations. My one year old  singles this book out every time she crawls over to her library to pull out  a book. This treasure is sure to become a classic
6301969588|5.0|This movie is definately not for the faint hearted.  Besides some truely terrifying scenes--the freaks crawling in the rain after the acrobat, and the feast scene where they chant &quot;gooble, gobble, gooble, gobble, we  accept her, we accept her, one of us, one of us..--it provides an adequate  story and presents the circus freaks as people trying to make a living. It  is definately worth your time to watch.
B00000AFFF|5.0|Bacharach is back! And he's perfect for Elvis' tender voice. The songs on this album are the saddest ever written. This CD and some cocktails will have you sobbing your eyes out if you've got a broken heart. I had to hide  it from myself, it's just too powerful. God give me strength. Thank you  Burt and Elvis. What the world needs now is more real music like this.  Timeless, tortured and beautiful. Just like Christina.
B000002UAR|5.0|I really liked Revolver for it's crisp, sharp sounds .  IN Eleanor Rigby, the use of a clear violin only sounds great and is well written.  Here, There and Everywhere is another favorite... It's so sweet!!!
6305226296|5.0|Before seeing this video, I couldn't even name the Bee Gees but this music was so great and the variety so overwhelming that I am now hooked on the Bee Gees and can't get enough of them.It makes me wonder what I was doing  in the '70s. I'm 51 years old. Same age as Barry. I do truly believe also  that the Bee Gees sound better now than ever before.
068484267X|5.0|What a phenomenal story of life in Ireland...all the struggles and hardships and Frank still managed to come out strong.  I hope that he continues to write and would love to hear more about his life after he  arrived back in America!!  Two thumbs up!!
B000002HMH|1.0|Awful.....absolutely awful.  Even though Metallica has sold out,that's not my gripe with this album.  This is just poorly executed nonsense.  It truly is a feeble attempt to reach a wider audience.  This album is missing some  of Mick Foley's testicular fortitude.
630522885X|3.0|The movie itself was great, but the transfer is extremly diaappointing, considering that Fox Lorber acquired it recently after Home Vision Cinema lost the video rights. Fox Lorber could have gone through new tranfers and  a color and sound restoration, as they reportedly done with their new  Truffaut releases on video and DVD (or it could've done by the French and  picked up by convience and after Criterion lost their rights to the films,  anyway, Fox Lorber claimed to have done &quot;new translation&quot;).<br />The  video and sound quailty is extremely poor that colors changed throughout a  scene and the audio is quite low accompanied by tics and hisses. Fox Lorber  did a disservice to everyone since this is the one and only source many of  us have to watch the film. (As a side note, the director's cut, with a  running time around 140 minutes, is rarely seen after it was butchered for  a shorter running time since the production company was on the verge of  bankruptcy as the movie failed to make any profit. This was done, sadly,  when Ophuls was on his deathbed).
B000002H33|5.0|I love MetallicA, new &amp; old, but this is my favorite by the greatest band on Earth.  Roughly 12 years ago, a buddy of mine introduced me to this album &amp; a whole new way of life!  This was the band's last (&amp;  finest) studio album with bassist Cliff Burton, and is definately a Metal  Classic.  And for all of you that think MetallicA has sold out since this  album, remember that they were accused of selling out on this album (&amp;  the following tour with Ozzy).  They will always be Gods!
630416923X|5.0|Having produced and directed many tv music shows, American Music Shop, Nashville Now, Classic Rock with Wolfman Jack and currently The Grand Ole Opry Live, as well as documentary's, I have to say This is the finest  example of music history documentation I have seen. It clears up the  myth's, measures the success, and shares with all, how four guys from  Liverpool changed the  music industry and in reality how well they handled  it. Like their music,you won't want the last episode to end.I  didn't.<br />Rusty Wilcoxen Producer/Director CBS Cable, Nashville
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt shares his painful and poverty-ridden childhood, including very flawed, but colorful characters, who never figure out a way to overcome their circumstances.  Frank himself, does cleverly and slowly find  his way out, and is evidence that one can never predict the final outcome  of a human being raised in even the worst circumstances.  This book is also  evidence that the literary community is capable of recognizing great  literature, even when it comes from an unknown writer.  Frank's style is a  type of stream of consciousness, that takes on a different dimension than  Joyce or Wolfe.  It is funny, lymerical, tragic, goes from character from  character, and comes to age as Frank comes to America.
6305308659|3.0|Too bad.. one of those movies that could have been something special. Wonderful to see and marvel over the technical aspects but as usual the story left a little to be desired. Would have been better if Pleasantville  were a little more (un)realistic. Did the Cleavers ever eat a breakfast  like that? I think the old sitcoms had rain once in while also. Some things  didn't make much sense to me either, such as why didn't the mob change  color after trashing the malt shop, when our hero did after fighting with  Whitey? And when exactly did Whitey enter the movie? Maybe I was dozing by  then. I'm probably being too picky but I'm tired of seeing movies that look  brilliant , but seem to be written or edited with boxing gloves on.
0156528207|5.0|This is a book that every person must read as often as possible. The recommendation for children is not accurate enough.  I want to buy it for my 22 year old boyfriend because he has the misfortune of having never read  it.  There are more lessons within for adolescents and adults than there  are for children.
0425170055|5.0|I thought the book was execellent, although in some parts it did get a little discusting. I beat the game before I read it and I found them quite different. I still liked the book - read it in less than 2 weeks.
B000001E21|5.0|I picked this album up the first time right after it came out (my first copy was lost in college).  It is a great album all the way around, but I think my favorite song is From the Inside.  It has a nice Celtic feel about  it, and has a strong message about addiction.  This is one to own, even if  you're not a big Def Leppard fan.
B000006OAM|5.0|This is one of the best cds.  I absolutely love Natalie's voice.  I fall asleep to that cd every night.  I recommend for to everyone buy this cd.
068484267X|5.0|Last fall, I read this book for a LIT class I was taking.  I found it to be one of the most touching novels I have ever read.  From the perspective of a middle class family located in Mid-America in the 1990's, I was  completly overwhelmed by the amount of striff and terror that Frank McCourt  accounts in Angela's Ashes.  Reading some of the other rewieves on this  page, specifically from the person who on 5/24 gave this phenominal book 1  star, I had to write one of my own.  The essential part of reading this  book, regardless of how you viewed the finished result, is that if Frank  McCourt had not retold every &quot;ugly&quot; detail of his youth, there  would be no story.  NO life is void of disgusting events.  Every life,  including that of the McCourt family, has to endure pain and suffering  inorder to come out on top in the end.  It is the fact that Frank McCourt  is able to look back on the events of his childhood and write about them  with a mixture of agony, laughter, and triumph the speaks volumes for the  character of the man that is Frank McCourt.
B000003S5H|5.0|Heard the song &quot;Remember&quot; while walking to a bookstore and it just blew my top away!  I purchased it immediately and it has been in my fave collections since...  NO ONE will be disappointed to buy this album,  unless they are clueless of course...  more powere to the band.
B000002MG1|5.0|When my friend handed me this CD in college and said &quot;this is one of the best albums ever made&quot;, I laughed and said &quot;O.K. I'll give it a listen&quot;.  That was 7 years ago and still remains one of my most  treasured albums.  I always liked REM because they offered a different  sound than many other groups that are mistakingly placed in the same genre.   REM created a genre of there own, way before they made this album, but  Automatic for the People is their masterpiece by far.  All the songs,  music, Stipes voice, and lyrics are woven together to create a beautifully  rich tappestry of events that have occured in each of our hearts and remain  in our memories.  Which is why replay value on this album is priceless.
6300268470|5.0|First off, anything with John Wayne in it is great. This is a movie you can watch over and over again.  All I can say is, this is a must see.
B000002VTE|2.0|I thought this album was pretty good, but not nearly as good as some of the other albums released in 1997. Radioheads OK Computer, and The Verves Urban Hymns were better, although I have to admit that Spiritualized went  out on an artistic limb to an extent not approached by other British  artists. Ive always found them to be a good band, and look forward to their  next release.
068815333X|5.0|Few writers can make me laugh out loud with their sarcastic and smart aleck dialogue.  Lehane is one of the chosen few.  A terrific vacation book!
B0000025HU|5.0|London Calling, Who's Next, Allman Brothers - the Fillmore Concerts, Buffalo Springfield Again, Abby Road, Dark Side of the Moon<br />Start there...
B0000087GT|5.0|I was in complete awe over the sound of this caramel toned, stunning looking man's voice. He sings with the most melodious tone of voice and  his talent speaks for itself.    I await his second CD with open arms.  Me  and those dreaming eyes of mine, I just know he sings for me.
B000001FC0|5.0|There is no doubt about it: This album belongs to the Hall of Fame. Unfortunately Amazon.com does not offer the remastered gold-edition by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab. It includes two bonus tracks - the extended  Versions of &quot;Everybody Wants To Rule The World&quot; and  &quot;Shout&quot;. Trust me, it's worth the higher price - not only because  of the 24k Gold-CD, but the very rare &quot;Shout&quot;-version with that  incredible guitar solo will take your breath. The damn guy in Vancouver who  stole that CD out of my car may die the thousand pains. . .
0780622545|5.0|This movie showed me how small and limited we are. Where are we from? where can we go? The movie brings to us the idea that we can't go anywhere from where we are, and we don't now where do we came from, and we are  nothing more but a sum of our memories.  It is a movie that nobody can  miss!
0061092037|4.0|Raw ambitions, male chutzpah and naked rivalry are the themes of Archer's ambitious publishing tale.  Who will win?  Who will take over the newspaper industry ?  You should figure it out by half way through, but that doesn't matter.  I  ahven't read 700 pages so fast in my life, and I read fast.  This story  whips by, and will never cease to please or entertain.  Pick it up, and let  it take you along.

B000002UAX|5.0|Some Beatles songs that Leonard Bernstein enjoyed and/or appreciated were: &quot;And I Love Her&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot;, &quot;For No One&quot;, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;,  &quot;Michelle&quot;, &quot;Girl&quot;, &quot;Here, There and  Everywhere&quot;, &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot;, &quot;Penny Lane&quot;,  and a few others, I'm sure...  You would actually have to check out the  Beatles' other albums to get a better idea of them, or discover other  noteworthy tracks.  Maybe the &quot;White Album&quot; isn't a good idea as  a Beatles &quot;primer&quot;, maybe you'd have been better off starting  with their `hits' anthologies (like &quot;1962-1966&quot; and  &quot;1967-1970&quot;)...<br />I enjoy classical music as much as the other  guy, but I like to think I'm also capable of appreciating `other' types of  music, as long as it demonstrates musical talent and remarkable songwriting  ability - regardless of genre (pop, jazz, even weird  `experiments')...<br />While I am sure of your passion for classical music, I  find it a bit hard to believe, regarding the &quot;White&quot; album, that  you didn't detect any worthwhile melodies in songs like &quot;Dear  Prudence&quot;, &quot;Blackbird&quot;, &quot;I Will&quot; or  &quot;Julia&quot;. (Yes, some of them are &quot;rock&quot;-type melodies,  but melodies nevertheless... Perhaps you need to get a bit more acquainted  with the &quot;rock&quot; musical language...)<br />You must surely know that  many, many famous classical composers (Mozart, Beethoven, Bartok, to name  but a few) did not `look down' on the `pop' music of their era -peasant and  folk music- but rather enthusiastically considered it a valid inspiration  for their own compositions.<br />Likewise, Berstein was in no way snobbish  about his musical expertise and the world of classical music, as compared  to pop music - it would have been impossible for him to write Broadway  music had he looked down at the world of `pop' music as something  despicable and beyond contempt!  Quite the contrary, (if you've seen the  &quot;Young People's Concerts&quot;) he gleefully made repeated references  to the pop tunes then in the Billboard charts to illustrate a point, or to  expand on something about &quot;classical&quot; music.  For Bernstein,  there was not really a issue of &quot;classical vs. pop&quot; music - to  him it was all the same -music!<br />If you really desire to explore the  &quot;new&quot; world of rock music, then, perhaps you just need to `open'  your mind a bit...
B00000IHHM|5.0|I was introduced to this musical by a Parisian friend about 4 months ago.  I've yet to stop playing it. I don't speak a word of french, let alone understand it, but you get the feel of the story through the emotions in  the songs.  The songs can get stuck in your head for days! I highly  recommend checking it out.
0385493800|5.0|This book reinforces Grisham's popularity, at least with me - the first chapter completely grabbed my attention and the rest of the book didn't let it go for a minute.  Grisham paints vivid, believable characters who are  easy to visualize, and it is obvious that he has done his research on the  Amazon river basin.  I could picture each scene as if I were watching it.   Maybe that's why Grisham's books make popular movie screenplays, because it  is easy to visualize what is going on in each scene.  Definitely one of his  best yet.
6302994063|5.0|What can I say which other reviews before me haven't said yet?! They all expressed the movie very well.<br />Lots of memorable scenes in this movie. The actors have great chemistry together! The screen just sizzles........  You won't be disappointed with the movie, PLUS you won't forget it!
6305268843|5.0|I absolutely cherish this movie.  All the performers were magnificent.  No one was a characature.  Each was portrayed with subtle sensitivity and depth.  Stephen Dillane is a favorite of mine, and this movie is what made  me first take notice of him.  This is a truly well-written tale where the  story was driven by the troubles of the times and the individual stories of  each character.  GREAT choice of a video rental on a rainy day or evening.   It's a shame a movie as wonderful as this was, didn't get the exposure of  the more &quot;Hollywood&quot; type ones.  But, these days, that just makes  me take more notice, and I surely wasn't sorry when I went to see  &quot;Firelight&quot;!
B0000025P9|5.0|Toto is my all time favorite band. I consider this album to be their best ever.  They are GREAT musicians.
B00000AFFF|5.0|It's very rare that I can say that every track on an album contains an excellent song. In fact, I cannot remember enjoying a pop album more than Painted From Memory. An unlikely but wonderful duo of special musical  talents...only negative is the CD doesn't come with the lyrics or tell you  who wrote them. Rats!
B000002UAI|5.0|This album sounds vibrant and alive to me, as the hardy Beatles power their way through an amazing selection of covers and originals, all bashed out in the same year as &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; and several hit  singles. God, they were good. They constantly renewed themselves.  Harrison's guitar solos have gotten more confident here, and Lennon's voice  is still a wonder. Note also the introduction of introspective lyrics, and  odd instruments like tympani and electric piano.
B0000027RL|5.0|I recenlty picked up &quot;Ten&quot; by Pearl Jam, and can't stop listening to it.  I love the guitar parts, and the unique but energizing voice of Eddie Vedder.  I love &quot;Alive&quot; for the guitar solo at the  end, and &quot;Jeremy&quot; because I can relate to Vedder in it, and I  love the lyrics. I have heard that the title &quot;Ten&quot; is from the  jersey number of Mookie Blaylock, who PJ idolized.  To other listeners... i  recommend &quot;Creed&quot;-&quot;My Own Prison&quot;  anyway peace!
6305358613|5.0|This is a great movie, and captures much of the intrigue of the age. I was surprised by the vehemence of some other reviews, citing historical inaccuracy. While Elizabeths affair with Dudley is undocumented, many other  'inaccuracies' are based on one or other source from the time, which were  often conflicting. This was an age of upheaval and intrigue, with Catholic  and Protestant writings in fierce conflict as history was written and  rewritten according to who held power.  As an interpretation of one  possible 'truth', it is truly engaging. Whether you agree or disagree with  the detail, the key to this film is the mood of the nation and of court.  This it captures outstandingly. As for too much sex, this was the age when  prostitution was legal, and in London licensed by the Church as a source of  revenue (the site of the Bishops Brothels in Southwark can be seen today,  alongside the Clink Prison and Shakespeares Globe (reconstructed). Far from  the British being above this sort of thing, we are obsessed by it (I speak  as a native). Those who view Britain through 1970's drama series and the  literary works of the Bronte sisters should really get out more.
B000003S5H|5.0|Moon Safari is, perhaps, the best album in my collection.  I can listen to it over and over again without growing tired.  This album takes music to new levels, but in a good way...
B000002UAR|5.0|This album, the Beatles' sole offering of 1966 (they had been releasing two albums a year in the UK from 1963-65) is a great pop record.  Many fans regard &quot;Revolver&quot; as their best work.  Personally I rate it third  in line behind &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; and &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.  If you  have these two albums in your collection and are looking for another  Beatles album, this should be the one you buy next.  Why Capitol in the  U.S. had to butcher this album at the time and actually leave songs off it  is totally beyond me.  At least U.S. listeners can now enjoy the album with  all the songs on it, as the Beatles intended.  Although I would rate  &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; the all-time best Beatles record,  &quot;Revolver&quot; is arguably the most influential.  The sound of this  album has had a massive influence on many of the bands coming out of the  &quot;Britpop&quot; scene in the UK during the mid-1990s.  The quality of  the songs on this album is superb and is a more complete work than its  predecessor, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.  The best track has to be the closer,  &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;.  It may be their third best work in my  view, but it's still worthy of five stars.  A classic.
630529142X|1.0|Adam Sandler's new movie, a comedy with NO laughs, is, to make a pun, a watered down attempt to cash in on his mass appeal. The mere fact that this, the most &quot;Un-funny&quot; of movies, made so much money in  America attests to two facts: this movie either appeals to you if you are a  teenager, or stupid(Which, by the way, many people are)--the later, oddly  enough,is often combined with the former. Now, to briefly explain the  movie: it is, as my title suggests, a one-joke comedy. Sandler's  &quot;Cajun&quot; accent is so fake its laughable, and the movie itself is  a carbon-copy sports comedy--which means that there will be a big game,  and, of course, a despisable and utterly undefeatable team of villains that  get their just deserts. The &quot;One Joke&quot; I keep referring to  appears in every scene, as Sandler yells some unintelligeable words, and  tackles something--hard. At one point,as I watched with several friends, I  laughed at their having laughed at a scene involving Sandler's tackling of  a college professor--that was the one time I actually laughed. To make a  long and pointless story short, I will conclude by saying that this one  ranks up there with Bill Cosby's &quot;Leonard part 6,&quot; a movie that,  by contrast, provides at least twice as many laughs(That's not saying  much).
B00000IQBN|1.0|After seeing this, it will surprise no one to learn that Stanley Kubrick was once a professional stills photographer. He must also be a professional hypnotist to have so many sheep under his power.
014028009X|1.0|Thank God this comes from the other side of the Atlantic. This book speaks to all that is trash in American (and I suppose British) culture. It's popularity is regrettable but not shocking. The writing is horrid and the  dribble, worthless. This is talk-show pathetics at its worst! Does anybody  really care what she weighs and smokes and drinks? Sadly, the answer to my  question is apparently, YES. Somebody, please give B.J. some prozac! I am  24 and female and an avid reader. Most of my friends loved this. I can't  for the life of me figure out why, but I felt I had to write in when Amazon  recommended it.
068484267X|5.0|Mr. McCourt (I can't think of him as Frank) was my English teacher at Stuyvesant High School in 1979-80, where I had two terms of creative writing with him.  He told a number of the stories that ended up in  Angela's Ashes (and will no doubt be in 'Tis) to our class, and we all  urged him to write them down, to write a book.  It sure took him long  enough, but it was well worth the wait.  That he survived a childhood he  had no right surviving and then wrote about it without anger and animosity  is a tribute to a great man, a great teacher, and a great book.  It proves  that the human spirit lives within us all, and triumphs over adversity.    Mr. McCourt wrote my college recommendation, and I can honestly say that it  is due to him that I am a successful Senior Editor at a major publishing  house today.  Viva McCourt! P.S.  A little known fact is that one of Mr.  McCourt's favorite authors is Mickey Spillane.
0380002930|5.0|I love this book, Hazel, Fiver (especially) and all of the other rabbits in this book.  I thought that the plot was well thought out and the author knew what he was going to do in the story, unlike stephen king
1559408758|5.0|&quot;Spinal Tap&quot; is so funny because it does such an effective job of showing up popular culture (rock culture specifically) for its abundant superficiality. At the same time, the &quot;documentary&quot; format  heightens all the humor because EVERYBODY -- the director (Rob Reiner)  included -- hangs on their verbal drivel so, so seriously.  The end result  is that this is one of those amazing films where none of the characters is  ever mugging it up for laughs or guffawing,  yet the viewers will be in  tears and holding their sides. And if this isn't enough, Reiner actually  gets you to LIKE these rock and roll space cadets, devoid of substance as  they are. A wonderfully different and creative comedy... highly  recommended!
0875845851|3.0|Great book. It could have been shorter as it has too many examples.  There is another neat book Discipline of market leaders that I recommend. This one kinda expands on the product leadership side of the value.
0446310786|5.0|'To Kill a Mockingbird' is the epitome of good English Literature.  This heart-warming novel by Alambama native Harper Lee brought tears to my eyes on more than one occasion.  Once you pick up this book you definitely  cannot put it back down. A true classic, in my opinion. It's a story of 8  yer old Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch dealing with her white Father defending  negroes  in a small prejudice Alabama town as well as her adventures with  Boo Radley, a boy who hardly, if all, sticks his head outside the door of  his home. A compassionate tale - to say the least - of dealing with  grown-ups and trying to understand their way of thinking and the way their  adult world works. And for anyone who thinks thing timeless masterpiece is  overrated would honestly not know good literature if it came up and bit  them in the a**! The book is just that good.
0451196716|4.0|On the whole, this book was really good but the ending was kinda 'incomplete'.  I don't really know how to describe it but I had this feeling like it wasn't totally finished yet... I knew right from the start  that Garraty was going to out-walk them all. Another thing is that once  more than one fourth of them had died, the rest of them just started dying  too quickly. Apart from those few pointers, this book was very nice to  read.
0451167716|5.0|Outstanding work of literature. I have seen the movies several times and was amazed at what was left out. I can not wait to see the movie again because the book has given me new insights into the characters and there  motivations. <br />The scene were Michael goes to Las Vegas plays out much  better in the book, as does the entire character of Johnny Fontane.<br />The  reader in Georgia should know that this book was on the NY Times bestseller  list for over a year BEFORE it was made into a movie. Yes the movie was  good, even great but this book is better.
6304167660|5.0|As opposed to the review by the person that wrote the movie was filmed in Tarrytown, NY, the movie was actually filmed in Eden Praire (a suburb of Minneapolis) and Stillwater, MN, which is a small town on the Mississippi  River. The clothing in the movie also gives it away that it is filmed in  the midwest. One scene has Michael Rappaport wearing a Milwaukee Journal or  Sentinel T-shirt.
B000001F4V|5.0|Just buy it. This 1984 release is a milestone in metal. Half of the tracks on the disc still get airplay and the tunes that don't are just as good. The full digital recording can blow your speakers apart. Sure, some of the  lyrics are silly and sexist, but who cares. Even my classical pianist  girlfriend likes this CD. I cannot think of a higher recommendation.
0767811038|1.0|If you enjoy movies that repeat the same events over-and-over again, you'll LOVE this one! The first human assault takes place entirely with ground-troops, who consequently wind up being slaughtered (hadn't they  heard of &quot;air-support&quot;?). It is this, first assault when the  human forces also discover that the &quot;bugs&quot; can attack their ships  in orbit. So what do they do for the second assault? Send more ships into  orbit (where they're promptly picked-off left-and-right), and send in  ground troops again! Any military force that operated in such an IGNORANT  manner would DESERVE to be annihilated. (I won't even bother mentioning the  rest of the movie's faults, as I'm limited to 1,000 words or less.)<br />From  reading the other reviews, I realize this was supposed to be satirical;  unfortunately, I only found it to be stupid. (This is from a person who  LOVES Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy!)
6303617719|5.0|I am a Meg Ryan fan, so when I saw this in the TV guide, I thought great. Just as expected, she didn't let me down.  My teenage daughters and I find ourselves quoting this film all the time.  A must see.
B00000F1D3|5.0|This cd is the greatest. It takes sounds of the 70's and combines them with 90's techno, and then the icing on the cake... The one and only Cher. I have listened to it nonstop for months and love the whole cd... I'm  really proud of Cher and thankful for 35 great years of enjoyment. I've  loved it all since day one, and this is GREAT..
B000000WF0|5.0|Someone else has already claimed this album to be the Best of the Decade, and I can only agree. The last album to be recorded by the band (unless they get back together again) is the best work of their unfortunately short  career.
B000002BBY|5.0|With the coming end of the 90's (as well as the century), (What's The Story) Morning Glory? will justifiably be showing up on everyone's list as one of the best rock'n roll albums of the decade, if not ever.
B000002C25|4.0|This album has never been given a chance. True, some of the songs are overly long and over produced, but if you get past that obstacle and actually listen to the material, you may find a real gem.
B000002AS3|4.0|Want to rock'n roll all night and party every day? Then this album is a must for your stereo. And even though the lyrics to &quot;Digsy's Dinner&quot; can be pretty silly, the catchy tune will grow on you.
B000001DTM|5.0|Albeit definitely different from their previous albums, U2 is one of the few musical acts able to experiment and go off into different directions with their music while still able to please their hard core fans.
B000001F3C|5.0|I have a special place in my heart for this album. It was the first album by U2 I ever bought, and it was the beginning of a beautiful devotion to the greatest rock'n roll group ever. <br />Just starting my teen years, 'War'  and U2 helped shape me into the person I am. At the time the album came out  (circa 1983), U2 was still little-known nationally in the US. When people  would ask me who I was listening to, and I would respond U2, I would get  that puzzled look and inevitable &quot;Who?&quot; I not only got used to  this, I found I rather liked it. I decided instead of being the usual  teenager and conforming to listening to the lastest fad everyone else was  into at the moment, I would stick with who and what I liked, no matter how  obscure or different it was from popular music.<br />'War' made me an  individual.
068484267X|5.0|Powerful yet disturbing.  Definitely a must read.  Next to Catherine Dunne's &quot;Interior Designing For All Five Senses&quot; this is the most impacting book I've read in a very long time.
B00000J7RZ|2.0|First I would like to start off saying that Jennifer is very beautiful but she should stick to acting. I heard some songs on the radio and some on the net and can we say no skills. Her voice is basically computerized everytime  she tried to hit a high pitch and she sucks. The only reason I gave her two  stars is because of the song she does with Marc Anthony which I have to  admit is quite catchy. If you want my advice get Marc Anthony's cd instead  Now there's real talent. But if you still have your doubt go on... buy the  album you'll see she sounds like a screming cat!!!
B00000J7RZ|2.0|I'd like to first come across and say that Jennifer is a very beautiful girl but I heard a couple of her songs in the radio and some on   the net can we say NO SKILLS!!!! She should just stick to acting because she has no  kind of singing talent.  The only reason why I gave her two stars was  because the duet she did with Marc Anthony is kind of catchy and Marc  Anthony is truly a singer!! If you want my advice, buy Marc Anthony's cd  better because in her songs all you'll hear is the sound of a screaming  cat!!
B00000G6NI|5.0|Rory Gallagher is a genius.  His ability to mix traditional blues with rock is a gift.  The songs on this CD are fantastic.  There isn't a throwaway track to be found.  I believe this is the first recording after  he simplified the band to a three piece and I think it works!   Gallagher  was asked to join the Rolling Stones.  He played guitar for Muddy Waters'  London Sessions.  What else do you need to know?  He rocks.  His music will  live one forever.
6302878527|5.0|If one is sick of or has out grown star wars this is movie to get.   In it one will find a script, incredible acting, and a director that treats the view like adults.  One can not watch this movie like a mindless spong, one  must insteed view it like a mosasic.   In which each sap shot of the  relationship between the Audrey Hepburn and Albert finny, presented in non  linnier way creates a view of a relationship.    Plase note anyone the does  not think Audrey hepburn was one the film actress and most stunning woman  of the century has not seen this film
B000000QG2|5.0|Rory Gallagher is THE most underrated blues/rock guitarist in the history of the genre.  This collection of songs rocks a little harder than some of his other CDs but that's fine with me.  The songs are great and his vocals  and guitar are second to none.  Know this...there are streets named after  Rory Gallagher in France and England!!!  America, as usual, seems to have  missed the boat on this amazing musician.  Do yourself a favor and buy this  CD.  It's great,
B000002IZM|5.0|...after it's dark, with all the lights out, doing nothing else but listening.  This is great, all of it.  The dialogue inserted is good too, if sometimes oddly placed (&quot;Blush Response&quot;).  Best of all,  though, is the music that wasn't in the film, which makes this CD a sort of  director's cut in itself.  &quot;Rachel's Song&quot; is shockingly  beautiful; &quot;One More Kiss Dear&quot; is actually very appropriate.  It  supplements the noir element of the movie in a song which, though sort of  cheery-sounding at first, has lyrics about death and mortality.  (Of  course, I'm probably spoiled by The Shining, which had the most chilling  placement of older music I've heard, and is pretty similar to this in that  respect.)
0767802772|5.0|This move is seriously one of the cutest movies that I have ever seen. It is hilarious when you watch the movie lots of times and begin noticing litle things. I recommend this movie for everyone... it is one of the best  movies I think of all time. It should have gotten some awards!
0783113943|5.0|When I was sitting in my dorm's lounge at 2 AM awaiting the drying of my laundry, I spotted this movie on HBO for the first time.  I was instantly captivated.  I dared not leave my seat for fear of missing a single moment  of this touchingly brilliant movie.  At the end, after I sat for a few  moments caught in a tearful trance, I checked the TV Guides right away to  see when it would come on again, so as to tell my friends.  We all are  devoted fans of Angelina Jolie and this movie gives her a chance to show us  her best!  If you haven't seen this movie, then you must!  It brings you to  levels of emotion that you may have thought were lost.  Tragic, yet hopeful  &quot;Gia&quot; is what a movie should be.
0679746048|2.0|Ms. Kaysen is annoying!  I kept trying to like this memoir and empathize with Ms.Kaysen, but I found her to be self-involved and kind of irritating. Sorry.  If you want to read an excellent memoir, try Lori Schiller's  &quot;The Quiet Room&quot;.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I first heard this album when I was about six years old, when my older sister would play it.  I listen to it now, at 30 years old and I can't even begin to tell you how good it makes me feel.  If I could give this 10 stars  I would. It is timeless.
0156907399|5.0|Woolf's TTL is her most often read novel, but this in itself does not make it great. TTL has several layers of understanding which may not be apparent to those who don't know Woolf. Woolf prefers texture to plot/structure. The  book occurs in three parts, two days separated by a 20-page interlude  representing 10 years of separation. There is a biographical layer, as  Woolf includes elements of her early life. There is a layer dealing with  changes in art (thus literature) spanning pre-WW1 to post-WW1. Lily  searches for balance. James wants his father's approval. Mrs. Ramsay is an  artist of community. Mr. Ramsay worries about his legacy. And there's  more.<br />Events unfold in Woolf's interior monologue style. The novel is  best appreciated in multiple readings, since Woolf's style often causes  beginners or first-time readers to misinterpret her reliance upon other  things than plot. An excellent work.
B00000255F|5.0|This album is an absolute must have for any rock n' roll fan.  It contains what is possibly the single greatest rock n roll song ever written (Born to Run).  The song's mix of bold and brash sounds combined with Springsteen's  poetic versers and imagery (such as the Peter Pan overtones of innocence  being lost makes it a classic, the classic).  The album is rounded out with  other Springsteen classics such as 10th Avenue Freeze out and Thunder Road.  Thunder Road is one of Springsteen's lyrical masterpieces.  The song  presents the themes of escape and acceptance in moving tones with forceful  but not overly strong musical accompanyment.<br />Backstreets, a song which  rises in vigor just as its lyrics is a classic rock tune and for those who  have never heard Jungleland, you will wonder why Springsteen is not revered  as Frost, Whitman, and other great American poets are.<br />The album's music  is awesome and the album could be purchased on that basis alone.  However,  if you do not listen to the lyrics then you are missing out on the greatest  elements of the album.
6301744160|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I have read the book and the movie follows it closely.  It is riviting and the effects are still great, even in this age of digital SFX.  It is definite classic!
B000002LMK|5.0|If you're a so called &quot;old-fashioned&quot; Rockfan who thinks that nothing else than bass, drums and guitar should be sufficient to create a perfect sound you found it with Ragged Glory. In it's field this album has  more power than any other I know. If you can sit motionless during  listening you must be either dead or deaf. Believe me. Play it loud and  good luck to your speakers. Ragged Glory will blow away any dust from  them.....
B0000027I6|3.0|Sorry, but I disagree with almost everyone on this page.  This is Waters' poorest solo record.  For fans only, but those fans will be rewarded with some great songs and many average ones.

0590353403|5.0|My name is Grant. I really enjoyed this book, It's very exciting and interesting. My favorte part of this book is when Harry Potter meets &quot;You Know Who.&quot; I thank my teacher, Mrs. Johnson, for reading  this book to us.
B0007Y08PQ|2.0|Star Trek: Insurrection had a misfortune of coming out when Deep Space Nine was still airing. It was a period when DS9 was pushing the Star Trek to a new heights where Gene Roddenberry dare not go. In comparison, Insurrection appears to be stale and dull. I think the basic story line failed to excite any one. I don't mind the humor and the banter that goes on among the crew, those were the hallmarks of all Star Trek movies and shows. But the story was really a non-event and it take place during the DS9's Domainion War which was even mentioned in the movie. What was the Federation's Flagship doing so far away from the frontlines while rest of Starfleet is fighting for its life? When at the times when millions of people were dying in a war on DS9, this movie story sound pretty petty and trivial.<br /><br />Eight years after the fact, the movie still don't look any better. The people who made this movie appears to forget that its always about the story in Star Trek. The fans can forgive special effects or other such things. Fans also can't understand why Worf was there. Doesn't he have enough things to do at DS9 to keep him busy?? When two Star Trek worlds don't jive, we usually blame the weak link and in this case, its the movie.<br /><br />As a \\"Trekkie\\", I can watch this movie although I may do so without any great joy. The Special Edition DVD set come with a lot of extras which make up for the dour movie and I enjoyed the extras more then the actual film. The image presentation and sound proves to be excellent. Of the ten Star Trek movies, this would be ranked as the third worst ever (other two being Star Trek V and Star Trek: Generations).
0385484518|5.0|I found the book easy to read.  It shows us that life is too short and we must live life and enjoy it.  I am glad to finally read a book which shows how a person facing death looks at life and his own death.  Anyone who  thinks that life is only work and making money should take time out and  read this book.  They will soon find that their is more to life and it is  meant to be lived.  It has helped me deal with and to understand death but  better than that it helps me look at life differently.

B00000IOSU|1.0|Having already preordered I can honestly say that there are some great versions of old songs. I have all of Sarahs Cds', gone to Lilith Fair every year, and tuned into every TV show apperance. I would really appreciate a  new CD that actually contained NEW songs. Please, please please, PLEASE,  write a new album.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Without doubt, Sarah amazed me, her forever fan, again by this CD.  I can't wait to go to her concert this June.  (So lucky to get tickets before it sold out)
B00000J7SS|5.0|A tremendous album, a masterpiece beyond limitations of sound itself. The Work of a horn, the sound of a guitar player called John McLaughlin.<br />Indescriptible.
6305169187|4.0|Bruce Willis did a fantastic job of acting in this high suspense and action thriller. The movie had the makings of a smasher. The language was rough at times, and some scenes I would definately not let any kids see,  but besides those faults, the movie was awesome! There was humor, suspense,  action, amazing graphics, and tear-filled scenes at times. Very nice job.

0788816454|5.0|I have heard some really harsh reviews on this flik, talking about the plot, actors, and other Adam Sandler movies.  Well get over it you brain maniacs.  Have you ever heard of a simple comedy? If you have to think  about it before you laugh you won't get the same gut-busting humor out of  it.  If you like Adam Sandler or just a good simple  beat-up-the-other-guy-on-the-football-field-story then give it a shot.  (Brain Maniacs Beware!!!)
0312853238|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER.  IT TELLS OF HAW A GUINESS, 7 YEAR OLD BOY, NAMED ENDER GETS TRICKED, BY HIS TEACHERS TELLING IT IS A GAME.  BUT IT IS MUCH MORE THAN A GAME.  THIS BOOK IS THE BEST BOOK EVER =)
B0000072VM|5.0|This album is a blessing for fans of progressive music. I rank Per un Amico as the best PFM album ever. The pastoral beauty of this music will simply amaze you, it has everything a prog fan needs: lush keyboards,  violin, flute, acoustic and electric guitars, solid drumming and beautiful  vocals. Definitely among the top 10 Italian progressive albums of all time.
B0000024Z7|5.0|The melodies laid down accross this record are both beautiful and so powerful, ever rishing higher with energy. Every lick reaffirms the melodic lines so wonderfully, the sense of melody never leaves you as the riffs  rise from carlo's guitar!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Once in a long while, an album comes along that gets deep into our hearts, minds and souls. OK Computer was that album for me in the late 90s. I have to admit that when I first bought the album, I only \\"sort of\\" liked it. But there was something as a whole about the album that kept me going back and listening to the album over and over again. And then one day - BOOM! I found myself intensely immersed in the sonic beauty of each song. There wasn't a note in any song that was there without a purpose. And Thom's voice - WOW. His smooth yet tortured vocals would slide from soft and vulnerable to confident and powerful effortlessly (Exit Music & Lucky). The guitars and keyboards were not just melodic and rocking instruments but a beautiful tapestry of sounds (Air Bag, Paranoid Android, Subterranean Home Sick Alien) inducing a hypnotic quality out of each song.<br /><br />OK Computer experiments with sounds, rhythms, and strong melodies to create some incredible music. Even if the songs were stripped down to their bare-bone minimum of melody and rhythm, the songs would still stand their ground.
B000002JPA|5.0|when i bought this cd for the first time, i thought their music would be as soft as Yes. But when i listened to the first song of this album, 'Pull Me Under'i got hooked up with this band and i couldn't stop listening to  their music. the band consists of the most highly talented musicians in the  history of rock.    conclusion: the worst thing that ever happened in rock  music is marilyn manson, and the best and greatest thing that ever happened  in rock music is dream theater.
B000002IZM|5.0|A brilliant soundtrack which adds to arguably the best Science Fiction movie ever made. From the retro sound of 'One More Kiss' ( which complements the Bogart-detective feel of the original film perfectly ) to  the Futuristic sound of 'End Titles'. Regards the film - the Directors Cut  is better. The Original has a different feel but is still brilliant. I  can't disagree from any of the praised hailed on this CD in the reviews  below...one of Vangelis' best.
B00000IQMT|3.0|While genuinely satisfied with the score in the film, I found the CD distribution to be terribly &quot;poppy&quot; in its style.  I suppose the source of this disappointment is having the special edition soundtrack  rereleases, where they actually did what should have been done at day 1  (_real_ liner notes, soundtrack in film order, battle sequences intact  (Hoth is spectacular on Empire once its in the right order -- leaves me  more on the edge than the completed film version at times).<br />This time,  its back to square one.  The CD has the requisite opening at track 1, the  requisite closing credits medley last.  But in between, its anybody's  guess.  No rhyme or reason to the order, and in doing so, it fails to  reinforce the strength of the music in context.  Especially annoying is the  wondering of &quot;what are we missing&quot; (like the original Empire  release missing the fantastic &quot;freezing of Han&quot;  sequence).<br />Here's hoping someday (maybe after 2 and 3 are out) they do  here what they did to the originals, and release the _real_ soundtrack.
0780623703|4.0|I have all ways been a big fan of movies that have   people from totally different generations met up, but I will have to say the only reason I watched this one because it is just so creative!!!!!! I think color and  B&amp;W look beautiful together. I'm not giving this movie 5 stars because  it might  just put you to sleep,but it has a really important message in it  that you can not explain but can sense when you watch this film. If you  havent seen this film you are for sure missing out. everyone should see  this film
0440539811|5.0|An army of dead Nazis at the bottom of the ocean waiting to be resurrected! Hitler waiting to gain immortality! A woman having twelve orgasms! What more do you need in a story?
0792151720|2.0|I guess all that can be said is that Cameron botched the dialogue in every way that the dialogue can be botched.  Add to that cardboard cut-outs for characters and all the cinematographic cliches that could be fit into three  hours, and you get an spectacular, and spectacularly shallow, film.  It's  not all bad, of course.  The cinematography _is_ beautiful, the acting is  generally acceptable and I agree that the framing device was very well  conceived.  But this is a very far cry from from the work of art some have  pretended it is.  In all fairness there were only two of its eleven Oscars  that the movie did not deserve: best picture and best director.<br />I am much  heartened to see that there are in fact quite a few people out there who  were not taken in by this, judging from the comments here.  Still, it did  become the most popular movie of all time...
6304708491|1.0|I bought this thinking it would at least have captions or subtitles. Total waste.
078062369X|5.0|I liked this movie for the justice it did to the comic book! The martial arts was a Plus! I think all the actors did a wonderful job on it! Although it did not get the respect it had comming from the film industry!
0789302691|3.0|I love Pearl Jam's music, but, they do take themselves a bit too seriously. A few of the photographs (a color band grab in Istanbul '96 is wonderful) show them as people and as a band. The standard guitar and/or  Christ poses are a bit much. <br />While you're at it... try buying their  music, like Yield, easily their best work.
6304493681|3.0|I don't know, Japanese culture is so radically different from Western, that's probably the reason Ghost in the Shell never did it for me.  It's not a bad movie, in fact it's good, well, that is until the ending which  absolutely ruins the whole she-bang (no pun intended).<br />The animation is  gorgeous, the plot and characters are well placed, but the damned ending is  so cheesy it makes me want to wretch.  I guess if you can bypass the ending  (I've custom edited my VHS version) then this is quite a good flick, just  don't expect a really cool ending (but hell, what movies these days come  out with a non-cheesball ending).  Face/Off anyone?  Ugh, another good  movie gone to waste by it's laughable ending.  Anyways, my two cents :P
B000002B38|5.0|The song selections are fantastic. The boys have been around for a while, but sound better than ever!!
0679745203|5.0|This is an incredible book. I won't describe the storyline because you'll hear that a million times in other reviews. What I will say however is that this is one incredible book, so full of beauty and foreboding that it will  crumple the strongest of hearts. Somewhat overpowering imagery coincides  with subtle, yet passionate character development to create a book  extremely worthy of the booker prize and any other awards there are. A  classic of literature, to be savored again and again.
B0000047CW|5.0|One of my favorite Stan Getz albums!  Very soothing and lyrical.  Get it today.
0684867621|4.0|From reading all these negative reviews, I have to wonder if a writer is permitted to stretch his talents and try new things.<br />I can hear the assembled cries now, &quot;Bring back the guts and the horror. Bring back  psychopaths and dripping eye fluid and cateclysmic apocalypse.&quot;<br />If  that's your attitude, read some Brian Lumley or something...<br />You can like  Salem's Lot and like this too. It's OK. Really.<br />And, no, this isn't the  greatest thing he's ever written, but I liked it. I thought it was  fascinating and sort of sweet, yet always suspenseful.<br />Give the guy a  break. He is a savvy observer and chronicler human behavior. He writes  interestingly.<br />I guess it comes down to the fact that no matter how good  Elton John is at writing musicals, people will always clamor for Don't Go  Breaking My Heart.<br />Sort of sad, really.
B0000047CX|5.0|This album couldn't be more beautiful.  I fell in love with it the first time I heard it on an old LP.  Everyone should have this album.
B00000IQMT|5.0|I will never forget the first time I heard the full soundtrack for The Phantom Menace, playing in all its glory for the pleasure of a small group of fans gathered in the early hours of the morning on Thursday early May  '99 for a special promotional breakfast at the Grace Bros Sydney City  store. From that moment I knew that no matter what the critics may say the  film will definately be a winner in my mind.  Although I am yet to see the  first installment of the prequel as it is not to be  released here in  Australia until next week i eagerly await its release and am happy to be  among those attending the Sydney Hoyts premiere.
B000002L42|5.0|Great album provides some fun and variety to the familiar songs
6305313687|5.0|This is the movie that should have garnered Edward Norton an academy award. While he may have had some stiff competition at the awards ceremony, I think it's east to argue that this is the best performance of the year.  Notable also are excellent dramatic turns by Beverly D'Angelo and the  usually annoying (see Pecker) Edward Ferlong. This movie actually sucks you  into the racist reteric it preaches throughout, and goes to show how  careful we have to be with what we say in front of our children. Take my  advise, just buy this film. And don't worry about Edward Norton, the way he  carried movies like Rounders, ...Larry Flint, and Primal Fear, there will  be plenty of time fo academy awards.
B00000ICD9|2.0|great dvd, loaded with extras-pity about most of the movie...a mawkish, almost embarrassing storyline saved only by director ward's imagination and visual flair.he's a great director and deserves better material than  this.watch &quot;vigil&quot;, &quot;the navigator&quot; and &quot;map of  the human heart&quot;, all available on vhs. all are brilliant. so what's  next mr ward?
B000002KXV|5.0|I couldn't believe it was Donald Fagen's voice - I stopped in my tracks, pondered the matter for a few seconds and then looked up.  The store clerks must have been doing this all day long to walk-ins like me.  I said &quot;  Is this Donald - &quot; and some guy behind me said &quot; Right, Fagen,  brand new&quot;, as if to say kindly: shut up and listen.  That was in  1982.  To this day,  I've never grown tired of The Nightfly, quite possibly  the greatest album ever produced.  This is THE music document to have on  your person for that moment in which you are called to board an ark or time  machine,  or for any lesser situation in which some knucklehead gives you  the Goodbye Look.   Just buy this CD and listen.  Fagen, a true genius,  is  indeed the master of Pop/Rock and every song on The Nightfly is a timeless  work of art. I would just like to meet Don Fagen some day and thank him for  his contribution to music and my life's happiness.
0345423496|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a decent read but after 2001 and 2010, I was a bit unsatisfied.  It didn't seem to be a fitting end to such a great series of books.
6301773551|5.0|Come on now!  This is the original trilogy!  This is how it all started.  Everything starts from this point and everything we've gotten used to from the star wars universe was started on this first film.  Absolutely  amazing!! =)
0141301139|5.0|Roald Dahl is always funny; but there are also hints of cruelty in each book- pehaps its because of the abuse he relates in his autogiography BOY. Though Mr. Fox must kill for his family to survive, in this book it is done  as bloodlessly as possible- and  he is quite a hero to lots of animals.
B000002B30|4.0|Although it is a greatest hits album and has some outstanding songs on it, the album does lack the depth and diversity of music that Bruce displayed throughout his career.  Isn't that the point of a greatest hits album?  A  broadstroke of one's career?  Overall a solid album.
B000002UB3|5.0|The Final Great Masterpiece by the worlds greatest and most influential rock band for all times, period.  If you dont like this, I pity you.
6305171769|5.0|I think most people have lost sight of what these movies are for. They are not made to inspire you, move you, teach you a life lesson or win an Academy Award. They are for ENTERTAINMENT. And that is what this movie did.  Were there some holes? Sure. Do you have to suspend some belief? Of course.  But if you are unwilling to do that, then why see a Halloween movie anyway?  I thought it had some tense moments, some very sly references (and some in  your face) to other horror movies and Jamie Lee did a fantastic job. So  back off and enjoy the movie for what it is, light, good-hearted, cheesy  horror fun!! If you want reality, turn on the news.
B00000FCBC|5.0|I think this CD is one of the best put out by Metallica.  It combines some of their classics with some of their new hits which make an awesome CD.  I would reommend this CD to anyone who like heavy metal.
B00000IP2L|1.0|I bought this CD back in December when it was an import, and was eagerly awaiting its arrival, as Zakk is one of my favorite guitarists.  However, this is not a good album at all, in fact, I think it's pretty close to  terrible.  The songwriting is horrible, and while the guitar playing is  good, the guitar tone on most songs is awful.  The biggest disappointment  is that there are few true rock albums released anymore, and I had hoped  that this would be one of the best.  Oh well, if you want great rock  albums, check out Mourning Widows and/or Gov't Mule.  Or even Zakk's own  Pride &amp; Glory CD, which is far better than this effort.
B000005J56|5.0|The music on this cd is timeless and universal.  Each track takes me far away from the my present situation; the music makes me forget about my own little petty worries.  Pop this cd in, sit back and do whatever makes you  relax, and absorb some of the most compelling music that you will ever  listen to.
B000002HPT|1.0|This album is basically standard-fair rock songs that are drawn out to excrutiating and repetitive length. In the 3 1/2 albums from the past I've come to expect better from Dream Theater.  I am sorely disappointed by this  album.
6304613199|5.0|If you are a dino-buff like me, then you already know this is the best adventure movie for someone eager to watch the marvellous  beasts in full action! OK, the story is lame and uncredible, but who cares? It is just an  excuse for us to watch the real stars: T.rex, Velociraptors, Triceratops,  Parassaurolophus(what a cool name!)and Stegossaurs. The animals are  portrayed as nimble and reasonably smart beasts. That's great and in  accordance to recent conclusions by some researchers. <br />There are still  some paleontologists that claim the dinos were stupid and with a low  metabolism, just like present-day lizards. I don't know: if that were true,  how could they keep their dominance for 150 million years? Mammals were  around since the beginning of the dino age but were relegated to a very  humble ecological role during all those million years. Birds are  intelligent and extremely active and they evolved directly from  Velociraptor-like dinos. So I think it is ok to portrait them the way the  film did.  Some behavioural details (the way T.rex took care of its  offspring) may be purely speculative, but not impossible.<br />My  dream is  that someday all this high technology (if not the same budget) will be  applied to film a serious documentary about dinossaurs or, even better, the  whole history of life on earth. While it doesn't happen, stay with  &quot;The Lost World&quot; for fun, excitement and lovely (although  man-eating) &quot;monsters&quot;. Spielberg is the right guy to direct this  movie (hey, he's one of the best in the business!) and it is a highly  satisfying experience. Remember, you will watch it because of the  dinossaurs!
0896762173|5.0|It's surprising that this book, which is entirely illustrated with pen and ink drawings of surviving  garments, conveys so much information about period costume.  I learned a lot from this book, and enjoyed it greatly.  The only thing I wish Ms. Bradfield had done differently is to include a  color photograph of each garment in addition to the detailed sketches she  provides.
B000002N3N|5.0|This album was actually my first exposure to Enya's music and New Age music in general. A friend of mine at work played it once, and I was mesmerized by the beauty of the title track and &quot;On my way home&quot;,  &quot;Teahouse Moon&quot;, &quot;La Soadora&quot;, &quot;Pax Deorum&quot;,  &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; and &quot;China Roses&quot;. Needless to say, I  bought her whole collection shortly afterwards. I'm sure you will also  enjoy it. Happy listening!
0374172897|1.0|Depressing tale(s) of unhappy homosexuals pondering their fates.  The author clearly thinks many/most are barely clinging on to their sanity, going through life faking it, and living day to day looking for a way out.   No joy of living here. Life is a *****.  A Pulitzer?  Jeez!  Prozac for one  and all.  Get a life.  ENJOY life rather than read about mopers who spend  time inching flower pots around on coffee tables to get just the right  effect or contemplate what might have been rather than taking what life has  dealt you and giving it your best shot.  We've all got problems.  Why waste  226 pages on hand wringers who can't deal with theirs?
B000002VCT|5.0|Alan Parsons Project's Pyramid is a classic.  Stories told in song in a variety of rock formats make this one of his best albums.  Great road music or late at night in front of the fireplace.  Not to be missed.

B00000I8NC|5.0|A frighteningly brilliant EP hard on the heels of an equally stunning full-length, Slow Riot etc. devotes a little more attention to the stirring martial passages and fist-pounding themes that punctuated the  aforementioned earlier release.  A difficult band to review since they're  sui generis -- I honestly can't think of any other band that's doing  anything close.  A high-volume listening session usually leaves me feeling  like my soul has been sand-blasted. At the same time, this band's work  gives me a ready response to jaded cynics who claim that no one is  producing music with any craft or imagination, since GSYBE! has both in  spades.  This music is an antidote to a cretinized American pop culture  that has given us Pauly Shore and Celine Dion (and yes, I know GSYBE! are  Canadian -- maybe they know something in Montreal that we don't...).  Try a  little Slow Riot at your next cocktail party!
B000003TA4|1.0|this cd is one of the worst cd's i have ever heard . it has to be the most overrated cd by the most overrated band in history. the vocals make no sense and just sound terrible. the guitars lack focus and the drumming of grohl is just sloppy. metallica's cd is much better, and the  longevity of its popularity proves it.
0141301104|4.0|The story of The Witches takes place in the nineteen forties.The book is about witches with wild imaginations with vicious success and unsuccessful stories. Even though there is only one unsuccessful story. The book has  many different settings in England. One is at the boy's house, another one  is at the hotel.<br />     One of the main characters is the boy. He and his  grandmother go and find witches, but try to stay away from them at the same  time. Grandmother is another character who's the boy's real grandmother.  She tells the stories about the witches. Another main character is the lead  witch. She is the main witch with her long gloves and bald head she hunts  down every child she can find for food<br />     I loved this book because the  characters are strong and with a good plot. It also has very queer stories  that you and I would of never thought of. All the attitudes and viciousness  is magnificent.<br />     This book is in a class of its own. I would say I  didn't read any book like it. even though all of the books by Roald Dahl  are with sarcasm and unreal imaginative things. This is one of the more  different ones. This book doesn't have only sarcasm and unreal things it  has style. I think this book is magnificent like I said before. Roald Dahl  has humor and sarcasm in the The Witches.
006016848X|1.0|I am surprised that so many women, including Oprah, recommended this book to \\"insensitive men.\\" Gray stereotypes females as much he stereotypes males. If you want to read really thoughtful material about relationships, read almost anything by John Bradshaw. Even though Bradshaw's star has waned, at least he did his homework and knew that men are from earth and women are from earth. Beyond Bradshaw, read Daniel Goleman's \\"Emotional Intelligence.\\" There is nothing gray about Goleman.
0385473788|5.0|I have not read this book since grade school, but I remember it being a very well-written account of the Frank family's experinces during the Nazi occupation of Holland. It should be read by all by the time they have  reached seventh grade, along with the story of Saint Maximillian Kolbe. A  word of caution, though: reading this book will make you doubt the worth of  humanity, or, as Mr. Frank says at the end, &quot;She puts me to  shame.&quot;

0792151712|5.0|I've seen this wonderful movie 21 times, so far.  I love it more, and more.  The story of Jack the 3rd class guy, and Rose the 1st class gal, is very touching and riveting.  The power of chemistry between the two are  incredible.  They really work well together.  They captivated me when I  first saw the movie.  The story's not the only excellent thing about  Titanic, but the special effects, too.  The effects shown as the ship is  sinking is so amazing and breath-taking.  It all looks so real.  What grabs  me the most, is that this is real life.  Not Jack and Rose, but the fate of  the Titanic is totally real.  I'm now a major Titanic fanatic!
B000001OAA|5.0|What can you say about this group, they are simply my favorite band ever for many reasons.  Everything about them is cool, image, sound, style, personalities, everything.  I have been waiting for an innovative and  unique blend of sounds like this for years, and Butch Vig was just the man  to pioneer such a miracle.  I've seen them five times and every time just  gets better. The youngest of the group is thirty, they feel blessed to have  a chance at fame like this late in their musical careers, and they love  their true fans, all in all a fantastice group and the best album I own.   All these great things and I haven't even mentioned that Shirley is a  goddess, but everyone knows that.  Would try to list favorite tracks but  they are all incredible and unique.  Get it.
6303148352|2.0|Read the book! It is so much better
B000002MFQ|5.0|Tubular Bells II has the same structure as the classic Tubular Bells, but is even better, written by a more mature artist.  The first track Sentinel, pulls you in with a piano rendition of the theme, then, after an exciting  few minutes, comes to a climax, and then finishes with a wonderfully  romantic version of the theme. The Bell has a master of ceremonies part,  where the instruments are introduced, then a bout of tubular bells, and  finishes with a single, perfect, ideal, acoustic guitar.  Weightless is  beautiful, with a few stunning piano notes, and Altered State is fun, with  grunting then a short,precise guitar solo.  Mike's best.
0446310786|5.0|Superlatives no longer mean much to this venerable classic, one of the best novels ever written.  So I'm more interested in describing what makes the book work.<br />Humour is one crucial factor.  By never succumbing to the  pretentious grandiosity that has plagued many a novelist since the form's  rise to prominence in the Victoria era, To Kill a Mockingbird achieves an  endearing relationship with its reader.  Every character is vivid, with  strengths and faults, and Lee achieves that difficult amalgam in  first-person narratives presented as recollections:  A mixture of an  adult's rhetorical power and a child's keen, curious eye.  The language is  fresh and unburdened by the moralizing which frequently cripples prose  narrative (especially books which deal with sensitive issues as this one  does).<br />Lee made a perfect choice in personalizing a socio-political  issue.  To Kill a Mockingbird is predominantly the coming-of-age story of  Jem and Scout Finch, and the themes of racism, injustice, conservatism and  the Depression are all the better served this way.  Issues do not come  alive except through the living, breathing experience of their participants  and Scout Finch's particular take on the events of this book only makes  those events gain in moral strength, not diminish.<br />Boo Radley, Atticus  Finch, Scout and Jem, Miss Maudie...the characters of this book have  achieved an iconic status rare in modern literature.  And it has achieved  this not by making them Nietzschean uebermenschen, but by entering into  their lives with fair, enthusiastic frankness.  And to end off, this is one  of only a handful of truly successful negotiations between the dramatic  (eg. theatre, screenwriting) and the narrative (eg. prose narrative,  filmmaking, folk storysongs) I can think of.  Lee's dialogue is sharp  enough, and immediate enough, that even if we pared this book down to just  its dialogue and situations, we'd end up with a remarkably powerful play.   As it stands now, it's a truly successful crossover, its dramatic  situations and character interactions every bit as convincing as the  engrossing power of its storytelling.<br />I am all for challenging the canons  of all artistic forms, but this one is about as close to perfect as I've  seen a novel come, ranking right up there with the greatest of the greats.   It has its weak chinks -- Atticus' misunderstanding of Heck Tate's point in  the second-last chapter is befuddling, for example, but these are so minute  that to dwell on them would be overkill.  Thematically worthy to be called  an American epic, this book never forgets the personal in light of the  social.  We should be grateful it was ever written.
0875845851|5.0|Wonder if the author is familiar with the works of James F.

B000000WHX|4.0|The opening track &quot;Safe From Harm&quot; is stunning. I couldn't stop playing it when I first bought the album. This album is great for it's beats, lyric references, and all of the different vocals. The weak track is  &quot;Hymn of the Big Wheel&quot;. It goes on a little too long, but the  rest of the album kicks - &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot;, &quot;Blue  Lines&quot; and &quot;Daydreaming&quot; are the other standouts. This album  may not be as dark as &quot;Mezzanine&quot; but that doesn't matter. The  groundwork that these guys laid starting with this album makes it  essential.
0380973464|4.0|It's another Stephenson roller coaster ride, filled with entertaining plot loop-de-loops and sideways digressions.  Unfortunately, he's still having problems with endings.  Like most his novels, the last 5th of it becomes  very dreamlike-- things happen, and you're not quite sure why they happen,  but it seems to make sense anyway.  But the ride itself is more than worth  the price of admission.
B000002GMT|5.0|This has some classic, underrated ABBA tracks (The Day Before You Came, fr'instance), but any fan worth their salt should buy it for the previously unreleased I Am The City.  It's not one of their greatest, but the  production and sound quality is good (despite a dropout in one channel near  the end - I thought they recorded this digitally?!) and it's definitely  worth adding to the collection.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby ONCE again has broken new boundries with this album.  The man is a genious, and he proves it with every cd release.  This one being the most exciting cd to ever be released, because it ventures in to new territories.   What happens when the 30's jazz and blues meets the 90's techno, trance  and ambient.  Well, you get some of the most beautiful music moby has ever  created in this album play..  MOBY, IF YOU EVER READ THIS, YOU ARE THE  MAN!!!!!!!   And to the rest, this and every other moby album and single is  the most beautiful music i have ever heard.  If you never own another cd,  the entire moby collection is what you need.<br />Now I will sit impatiently,  and wait for his next release.
B00000I8UD|4.0|A return to form for Sylvian after the somewhat amelodic &quot;The First Day.&quot;  Guest performers Marc Ribot and Bill Frisell could have been used more.  The writing is strong, however, and the album sits just under  &quot;Secrets of the Beehive&quot; and &quot;Rain Tree Crow&quot; as  Sylvian's best work.  Roughly on par with &quot;Gone To Earth.&quot;   'Darkest Dreaming' is one of Sylvian's most beautiful songs - performed  entirely by himself.  A way forward perhaps?
B00000ICD9|1.0|OK, let me get this straight--the afterlife is a sticky, icky mess of paint blobs; the heavenly city is a Fellini movie; and angels who take all kinds of confusing physical shapes say things like &quot;When you do, you  will.&quot; Huh? Oh, and hell looks like a collection of old  &quot;Waterworld&quot; sets, with all those &quot;Titanic&quot; extras  still floating in the water. Sorry, but this one missed the mark. When will  Hollywood make a real film about real spirituality?
B00000IOSU|4.0|I believe that Sarah McLachlan is a very talented singer. Two of my most favorite songs would have to be &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; and &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot;. Both are very inspirational, and have a sort  of day dreamy feeling, like your in another world. They make you feel good,  and are great if you want to just lay back and listen to some quality  music.
0025002007|5.0|My father first read this to me when i was only 4 years old, and that's what made me a book addict. Full of underlying details and connections. The detail is found in few books today, a true classic. Rabbits and the lapine  language are an interesting way to express your feelings.
6302293553|5.0|Don't you hate it when you buy a videotape, watch it once or twice and it gathers dust?  Well, this is NOT one of those movies. I actually saw this movie in the theater years ago when it was first released. Twenty-four  years later, NO movie can make me laugh (and I mean roll on the floor, wet  your pants, CRY laugh) as hard as this one. I DEFY you to watch the French  soldier taunting Arthur and keep a straight face. This movie spans the  generation gap, too; my 15 year old daughter thinks this is one of the  funniest movies ever made. The scene with the Black Knight, as funny as it  is, may be too gross for younger kids, but they probably won't understand  the movie anyway. Watch it, you won't be sorry!
6300271285|4.0|For anyone who adored the stage performance, this is not a terrible conversion of a play into a movie. Even though most conversion's are terrible (case in point A Chorus line, entertaining but lacking) This movie  is quite funny but loses something in the change of ending. It's not a  slight change it's a complete rewrite. In the original ending everyone  dies. The movie banishes this idea giving a sappy, and happy but  &quot;CUTE&quot; ending. Overall. I could watch it everyday.
1558807381|3.0|In 1995 I found the Legend score on cd by Jerry Goldsmith and listened to it dozens of times before watching the only version available-the U.S release. I was disappointed and puzzled as to why this film was butchered  and stripped of its backbone, the Goldsmith score. I can only appreciate  this movie by simply listening to the cd and imagining how the music  glorifies  this fairy tale. TO THE EXECS-RELEASE THE ORIGINAL TRUE VERSION  SCORED BY JERRY GOLDSMITH
B00000DHRZ|5.0|As an old fart of 42 years, raised on Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep and Led Zep, I was skeptical of this CD, even after hearing and liking the single tracks on the radio. This may be the kiss of death to the young pups of  today, but this CD is absolutely great!! Walla Walla and The Kids Aren't  Alright were outstanding and truely relevant for today. When Feelings first  came on, I thought, &quot;Gee, a weird retread of an oldie!&quot; After the  lyrics became clear, I couldn't stop laughing! Great stuff, Offspring! Yes,  I will try your other CDs. My 19 y/o skater/musician son says Offspring is  old stuff, but I think it's brand-new! I'll keep flying down the autobahn  at 80 MPH, keeping the CD cranked up and yelling along with the band! I  can't wait for the rest of the CDs to arrive.
0553296981|5.0|This is a very sad diary to read and it is especially for Jews. I am Jewish and it was very hard to read this book. Especially when you are only ten years old like me...
0446310786|5.0|I had to read this book for school and it turned out to be one of my favorite books. The first chapter was boring and I didn't think I would get into it. After that though, it really picked up and was a very enjoyable  story. I highly recommend this book.
6305426651|5.0|This movie teach us that even in the worse situation we have the power to change things, that someone can take away from us the material things but nobody can take away our soul, our feelings, and the capacity to choose  between to be happy or not, that the parents are for their children the  teachers in the art of living.<br />This movie is refreshing and deep, in a  time when the most part of the movies bring messages of violence, sex and  hopelessness.
0783229569|5.0|If you dont party, you have never tried any drugs or do not like psycadelic movies, stay away from this one, but if you love OLIVER STONE movies or STANLEY KURBICK movies than this is for you. It messes with your  head it has wierd chacters outrageous situations and uses many camera  tricks that make you understand the thinking of the two drugged out road  trippers. Like I said If you party if you have used drugs than youll surley  love this movies its funny fast pased and filled with non stop laughs and  lingo which make you glad that you popped this baby into your VCR.
B000001ELP|5.0|I had been a KISS fan long before I got my hands on this album. Because KISS experimented on this album there were mixed reviews about this album. On the contrary to the critics, this is an excellent album. Even though the  music is quite different from typical KISS it sounds very much like KISS.  Overall its one of the best albulms by KISS.
B00000IPAX|3.0|This CD is ok but it 's not the best. Also Buddah is not the best eiter, it is a compalation of un-released stuff and Cheshire Cat songs. The best is definetly Cheshire Cat. One more thing if you want good punk get NOFX,  Decendents and Operation Ivy.
B000002V1D|5.0|Duran Duran 1993 (aka The Wedding Album-not to be confused with their 1981 and 1983 releases of the same name) is a stunning achievement.  The opening track &quot;Too Much Information&quot; bites the hand of the media which  has historically both blessed and cursed Duran Duran. &quot;Ordinary  World&quot; in not an ordinary ballad, and Simon is simply excellent.   Although Simon has been harshly bashed by critics who have called his voice  &quot;whiny,&quot; this ballad should prove once and for all time that  Simon *can* sing (I'd love to see even one critic hit those stunning notes  at the end of the song!).  &quot;Come Undone&quot; had me totally undone!   Simon's lyrics, Nick's haunting keyboards, and a golden-throated back-up  singer make this an unforgettable song.  &quot;Breath After Breath&quot; is  captivating and exquisite and makes me want to learn Portuguese! When Simon  sings &quot;you are my kind, you are my tribe&quot; I understand what it  means to be a Durannie.  &quot;None of the Above&quot; is simply  shattering, and remains one of the best Duran songs ever.  On the other  hand,and quite contrary to other reviewers, I found &quot;Shelter&quot; and  &quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot; to be boring, forced, and insipid (face  it, the lyric line containing the words  &quot;a dickey bird&quot; is  laughable and damages this song beyond repair or redemption).  Still, this  CD remains one of the all-time best album of the 1990s.  I strongly  encourage fans, old and new, to obtain this CD through any means  necessary!!<br />April Garwin
080013799X|5.0|I have personaly seen it nine times and it gets better every time. I absoulutely can not think of a funnier movie!
B000002U8A|5.0|Seven and the Ragged Tiger (seven coming from the five members plus their management team, and the tiger symbolizing success), went double platinum upon release.  The Fab Five produced a gem...songs like The Reflex, New  Moon on Monday,and The Union of the Snake are catchy dance hits which  demonstrates Simon's oddly unique ability to incorporate almost-nonsensical  lyrics and an unbridled sensuality and deliver an album with unstoppable  dance hits as well as an evocative and beautiful song such as Tiger Tiger.   This is a must buy.
0312853238|5.0|This is absolutely the best book every written, no doubt in my mind.  If you haven't already read this book, you're missing out!
B0000025P9|5.0|TOTO is without a doubt one of the most talented and gifted bands of our time, and TOTO IV is nothing short of a masterpiece! The precision musicianship is only the beginning. The orchestration and engineering are  without equal in the anals of popular music. My favorite track is 'I Won't  Hold You Back'. The chorus fade at the end is enough to leave you with  tears in your eyes. Study the lyrics and listen with your heart. It may  have been Toto's fourth album, but IV is number one with me!
6300271145|1.0|Maybe I'm not as articulate as the usual film critic, or self-indulgent for that matter, but after viewing 'Round Midnight I thought it proper to tell the persons in the jazz populace not watch the film! That is,unless  you want to over-serenaded with ballads and blues oriented chord  progressions! Francis' obsession with Dale Turner is what one might call  &quot;icky&quot;. Dale Turner himself, is a garbling fool whose speech  patterns simply annoy the viewer. The friendship that the Parisian and the  ailing be-bop musician form is anything but inspiring. It is riddled with  montages and various rescue missions. That is, Francis coming to the aid of  Dale, drunk in the alley, thrown in the police wagon, captured at the  hospital. Francis, get a life.  Oh well, jazzers send me your hate mail,  tell me how I don't understand the deep deep beauty and ambience of the  film-please, I'm waiting!
B00000JCB2|5.0|The new single that they have out is really cool. I hope that this one is as good as three dollar bill yall.

0790736233|2.0|I do agree with the guy who wrote review from Los Angeles on May 11, 1999, this movie is about faith, God but REAL science. I can not understand: Since the woman came back without any evidence,  why people just keep  asking her, why don't they  send another man into that wonderful ship  again? And this movie just stop here with some words &quot;...I believe  that&quot;, &quot;...I believe her&quot;.... Actually, you could believe  anything and nothing real! Question: shall we believe that every one from  us has had the outer-space experience in our night dream?<br />The second star  I gave to this movie is for the first 2 minutes and when the woman touching  the sky with her finger.<br />Nothing better than Year 2001 and Year 2010, not  at all.
0790701251|5.0|BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER I MEAN EVER SEEN. I AM 14 AND I SHOW THIS MOVIE TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND EVERYTIME I SHOW IT TO SOMEONE THEY SAY THAT THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN A BETTER MOVIE. IT IS VERY VERY VERY GOOD MOVIE BY  FOLLOWING THE CHARACTERS FROM THE ISLAND ALL THE WAY TO THE CITY OF HUE. A  MUST AND I MEAN A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6305229449|5.0|This is the best movie in the world!!!  I love it!!  The storyline is great.  Finally Disney woke up and made a movie that wasn't so &quot;boy saves girl&quot; and romantic!  The music is great too.  I'd recommend the  soundtrack to everyone.  I also think that this move is great for everyone  of all ages!  This is not just for girls!!!  This is great!
6305089957|5.0|Craven and Williamson have proven to be a potent team. Wes Craven has always been known as the Horror Genre's hit maker by far. Throw in Kevin Williamson with his screenplay and we have a horror flik with suspense all  throughout, but most of all giving kudos to/jabs at older horror fliks. Get  a great cast of great young actors/actresses.No one else can or will get  away with that, other than Wes Craven. Williamson has shown us he is a  genius and this film seems to have started his journey to success. Watching  Scream more than once will have you catching some things that you didn't  catch the first,second or third times you watched it.  Example is the  school principal scene, played by Henry Winkler, when someone keeps on  knocking at his office door. He opens up the door at one point and mutters  something. We see a guy mopping the floor and Winkler says &quot;not you  fred&quot;. Now look at this guy mopping the floor, he has the same  coloured shirt and the same dirty black hat as none other than Freddy  Krueger. That part was played by Wes Craven himself. Hey remember Krueger  was a janitor in a school. Anyhow, buy this movie and you will not get  bored with it at all. Very enjoyable.
0385484518|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! IT IS MY FAVORITE BOOK IN THE WORLD!!!!  I CRIED 7 TIMES BECAUSE IT WAS SO MOVING AND INSPIRATIONAL!!!  I READ IT AFTER MY GRANDFATHER DIED, WHO I WAS VERY CLOSE TO, AND AFTER I READ IT I WAS NO  LONGER AFRAID OF DEATH.  NOW I THINK OF DEATH AS A GREAT TIME TO COUNT YOUR  BLESSINGS AND GET CLOSER TO THE ONES YOU LOVE.
6305342768|4.0|I thought that it was a great movie,the wide screen version has seens that they cut out in the black holes first release on video. the picture quality was exelent. If you have kids and they like star wars they would like the  black hole. But there is that one part where the robot kills a man with  knife blades but there is not any blood. I thought it was a good movie.
B0000047CX|5.0|A classic.  If I had a choice of taking a CD to the grave this would be it!  Peaceful and candid.  I could keep listening to it for all eternity.  I heard it back in '73 at age 12, and I stil play it.  'Desafinado' is the  prime example of creativity and free spirit.  What are you waiting for!   Get it!
0375707972|2.0|This book is interesting in that the reviews are either 5 stars or 1-2 stars.  People either love it or hate it - no middle of the road. I have read it once and will have to read it again before giving it an intelligent  review.  However, I think it is a book that everyone should read, just to  gain their own opinion -  it isn't something you should take someone else's  opinion for.  Kind of like &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; or &quot;Grapes  of Wrath&quot; - you may not like the message or even enjoy the book - but  you should read it.
B000000OSE|2.0|duh... like they erased steven adler's drum tracks because HE was a heroin addict..?  replaced it with matt sorum's plodding drumming which kills any momentum these songs could've had... further, it's obvious that axl's  singing was done to the beat of steven adler's drumming... without it and  with the samsonite gorilla drumming of sorum his vocals don't make any  sense from a musical standpoint... drug-addict or not, steven adler was a  damn good drummer that propelled appetite and the rest of the band...  having said all that, &quot;coma&quot; is worth the price of admission  because it's the culmination of where the band was heading as axl took more  and more control(this is really his solo album...)... &quot;coma&quot;  isn't what it could have been with the adler of appetite, but then again  neither was this album and neither was guns n' roses by 1990...
B000002GVO|5.0|This album is amazing.  It has almost everything you need:  Great songwriting, lyrics, singing, guitar playing, production.  Every song is great if you only give it a chance (I hated Try and Love Again when i first  heard it but it is now one of my album favorites).  The eagles are an oft  underrated band in my opinion largely in part of the Hell Freezes Over deal  which turned me off from them when I first heard it (It really weakened the  originals).  Just get it.

6304602979|4.0|Hopper and Walken......What can I say? The last great act of defiance. Most probably one of the best scenes in all of film.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Although fans of Hole who are into their previous albums may very well not like the &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; Hole found on this album, fans of good contemporary rock in general should dig this album plenty.  Contrary to  some of the few (mostly inane) negative reviews above, Courtney Love has  not begun to sound anything like Celine Dion or Mariah Carey (both of whom  I'm not a fan).  Some of the songs do, on the other hand, sound a bit like  pissed-off Go-Go's, &quot;Awful&quot; in particular (the song for which I  bought the album), and Malibu does resemble something that might have been  put out by Sheryl Crow.  But other songs such as &quot;Celebrity  Skin&quot;, &quot;Reasons to be Beautiful&quot;, and &quot;Use Once and  Destroy&quot; simply rock (as does &quot;Awful&quot;), and I found the  slower songs intelligent and interesting.  If Love has &quot;sold out&quot;  she sounds mighty good all the same.  Highly recommend it.
0783227434|5.0|Bruce Campbell is, without a doubt, the greatest action hero in motion picture history. Hail to the king, baby!
6305127646|3.0|If you've seen the movie and love it, well, get the DVD. But: the transfer is pretty weak at certain points, *especially* during the &quot;revelation at Red Square&quot; scene near the end. The DVD doesn't seem to have enough  data on it to deal with the fast pans through the crowd, so it looks like  there is some horizontal resolution missing. <br />Another quibble with the  DVD: the director's commentary is the MOST BORING commentary I have ever  heard. To be fair, I only listened to the first 13 minutes of it, but it  bored me to tears. Noyce drones on and on about the old versions of The  Saint, and the old days of Hollywood, and how he came to direct the film (a  story he begins in the first 13 minutes but doesn't finish), and so on. Who  cares? I want to know what it was like to work with Val Kilmer, how they  did a few of the shots, where they found their makeup crew, etc. Just a  matter of taste, I guess.
0380715430|5.0|Who could imagine that a book about the English language could both engaging and genuinely funny? Well, this one is. It is both entertaining and scholarly. The chapter on names and swearing are both gems. Many things  are answered for which we never knew we had questions!
B00000DGUG|5.0|Those interested in JLP, i would say you are in for something new. SFIJ shows how much ALanis has matured, especially in her songwriting. Lyrics like &quot;Verbal Daggers.....you think i'm withdrawing the guilt tripping  you&quot; were done beautifully. &quot;verbal daggers&quot;- one of the  many great metaphors nicely done by alanis. the second lyric i mentioned  could be broken up. &quot;you think i'm withdrawing the guilt + the guilt  tripping you&quot;. absolutly brilliant!! only she could think of that!! An  absolute great lyricist. That alone is worth getting. The music adds nice  flavor and background. A new step for her, but works great.  Alanis' voice  has definitely improved. JLP was a little screechy at times but alanis  definitely cleaned that up without losing her angst nature. Awesome album!!
0517053616|4.0|Shakespear was a brilliant playwrite. This perticular book's only flaw is the format in which it is written. But don't let that stop you! It is a wonderful book, but I would expect nothing less from a book with William  Shakespear in it~
630467578X|5.0|LIKE AN EXPENSIVE CIGAR OR A RICH WINE, ARNOLD IS AN ACCQUIRED TASTE. ALL OF HIS MOVIES ARE UNIQUE. WHILE MY SPELLING ISN'T PERFECT, I'LL AT THE VERY LEAST SPELL THE MAN'S NAME I'M CRITICIZING CORRECTLY,  DUBLIN!
B00000IOSU|5.0|As I write this I am listening to the Mirrorball version of &quot;Possession&quot; on the radio. It is simply spellbinding!  That song is my favorite of all of Sarah McLachlan's recordings.  One day a coworker  popped it into her car stereo and said &quot;I love this, song, Possession,  Sarah McLachlan.&quot;  Of course, I couldn't remember the lyrics but the  melody stayed in my head for three months until I decided to buy a copy.  I  bought &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; which was simply astounding.   About the same time &quot;Building A Mystery&quot; started playing on the  radio.  My fandom really exploded in the summer of '98 when I went to  Lilith Fair.  Recorded, McLachlan's voice is gorgeous.  Live, it'll blow  you away!!  She came out and sang &quot;The Water is Wide&quot; with the  Indigo Girls.  She hit one note on &quot;wide&quot; that was so beautiful I  could not believe I was really alive.  Her set was incredible and it didn't  compare to that one note.  My friends and I left absolutely unable to  believe what an instrument of music Sarah McLachlan is.  What must it be  like to possess such an incredible voice?<br />The woman sings about crap  we've been through, stuff we're going through, stuff we've watched our  friends endure.  Her voice is so powerful she can scream, howl and moan  like our emotions set to music.  <br />Thank God she decided to become a  professional singer.
0375707972|4.0|I am astonished by the number or reviewers who missed the point of this novel enough to give it one star.  I have to wonder if they bothered to finish it.<br />Although I was sometimes annoyed by the fact that the  point-of-view is so legal, I kept in mind that Schlink is not a novelist by  profession but a scholar of law.  In that sense, his very direct method of  moral analysis seems perfectly appropriate.  Schlink simply approaches the  novel and its penetrating moral questions from his area of expertise, and  there's certainly nothing wrong with that.<br />As a scholar of the German  language and culture, however, I am disturbed that so many of my fellow  Americans missed the point so completely.  Perhaps many of us are incapable  of comprehending and analyzing difficult moral issues and their effects of  the human psyche.  The United States has, after all, never had to deal with  the guilt that invariably follows an event as inexplicable and horrifying  as the Holocaust.  Understanding of such difficult moral questions is the  only way to avoid complicity in our own Holocausts, and, as such, it is  essential that we dismiss neither the far-reaching effects of such a  tragedy nor our own moral failures.<br />_The Reader_ eloquently examines the  questions and guilt that modern-day Germans continue to face -- even 55  years after the Third Reich.  This novel forces the reader to ask herself  what she would have done in Nazi Germany and to ponder how one can finally  free oneself from guilt.  If you like thought-provoking novels -- and  especially if you're a Germanophile, you'll love this book.
0792898095|5.0|I consider it as one of the best examples of perfect filmmaking.
0441003257|5.0|...but only if you like intelligent British humor.  Full of &quot;Britishisms,&quot; I highly recommend Good Omens.  If you like Douglas Adams, you'll probably like this book.  It's witty, full of  well-formed ideas and characters, and thoroughly entertaining!
B000001ZS3|5.0|&quot;Oxygene&quot; is Jarre's oldest and best. It is a classic to me, always new, another album I feel the same way about is &quot;The Mystery by alexi&quot;. These two albums are my most favorite.
B000002WCJ|5.0|Simply Godly. The best power metal album there will ever be. Five thumbs up. If you like this album also try bands: Gamma Ray and Iron Savior. Iron Savior's &quot;Unification&quot; is also very very good.
0440219078|5.0|I can't say enough about how good this book is.  It's so amazing, it's hard to believe.  If you don't understand it, read it again.  I've read this book 3 times, and I'll probably read it a million more! Advice: READ  IT!
0375707972|3.0|I thought this book was going to incorporate more history in the story.  I had a hard time with the moral issues prevalent in the book, but at the same time was illuminated by how impressionable young people are.  At the  tender age of 15 major events can and most likely will have a lasting  impression on that persons life.  Was a quick read, but was disappointed.   It was not all I expected.
630349255X|5.0|I have seen this movie so many times I cannot  count.  Each time I have seen it I see something  new that I miss the viewing before.  Each time I  see it I forget something that I saw before.  It  is a piece of art that  will go down in my  collection as the best and most moving piece of  visual  art that I have ever seen.  Unforunatley I  was unable to see it on the big  screen, but I  have seen it on a huge projection screen and it  is  fantastic.  If you have never seen this movie,  rent it or buy it.  You  will not regret it. If  you are like me and have seen it, but not seen it   fully, watch it again.  I firmly believe it will  take me an entire  lifetime to watch this film.
B00000INEX|4.0|I began renting and buying videos to show my baby when he was 3 months old. Baby Bach is his favorite by far, and it was the only one that captured his interest for more than a few minutes when he was very, very  young. I thought Baby Bach was ingeneous, and I also watch the entire video  each time we show it to our son. (Note: I have not seen Baby Mozart yet,  and I hear it's even better.)
B00000ILDF|5.0|Now this is an example of what the Alien series is capable of.  Dark, atmospheric, intriguing, and boasting better performances than any of the other Alien movies, Alien 3 shows what an Alien movie should be.  The first  film was notable for the creature and little else.  Aliens was plagued by  over-commercialization and a weak final half-hour.  Alien 3, on the other  hand, focuses not on continuing the series, but rather on being an  intelligent movie in its own right.  The film more than overcomes its few  dialogue faults and has quite possibly one of the greatest endings thus far  committed to celuloid.
0449227421|1.0|I've read everything that Ken Follett has written; Pillars of the Earth is my favorite.  No, Eye of the Needle. No...you get the idea.  He used to write such interesting stories.  It was as if a beginning novelist wrote  this one and he let that person place his name on the cover.  Even the  dialogue lacked when compared to his previous work.  I beg him to write  another great spy novel!
6304117345|1.0|I don't think this movie was a comedy one,nor action.....it was just cheap...I regret the money I paid to watch it, just cheap special effects... Arnold has disappointed me as much as he has disappointed many  of his fans.:-(
B00000IL1K|3.0|The first few notes of Brightman's CD truly impressed me.  Her voice was flawless and beautiful.  She has a passion for those high notes too.  <br />However, after reviewing the hole CD I was not impressed as I originally  was.  The first few songs on the CD didnt quite do it for me. <br />It is  probable that many will find this CD to be sensual, romantic and soothing.  This CD reminds me of Enya even though Enya is Irish while Sarah is  Italian.  As for my favorite song on this CD, #9 better known as &quot;Un  Jour Il Viendra.&quot;
B000002UAX|4.0|One thing that is certain about The White Abum is the vastly differently opinions people have formed of this record over the years.  One of the most common complaints I heave heard about this LP is that it was &quot;too  experimental&quot; or &quot;too long&quot; for a Beatles record and they  should have trimmed it down to one LP instead of two.  Personally I don't  agree with this view.  At the time the Beatles recorded this album in 1968  they had accumulated many new songs so this album more than any other  enabled the Beatles to demonstrate their ability to write and perform music  in a variety of styles, a rare quality in any rock/pop act!  Those people  who slag off some of the less commercial and/or serious tracks on this  record are completely missing the point:  The Beatles were not afraid to  experiment and deservedly so.  In my opinion U2 are the only band since the  Beatles who have jumped in the deep end and experimented with their music  in a similar manner.  This album may not be as commercial as say  &quot;Revolver&quot; or &quot;Abbey Road&quot; but I would still give it a  4-star rating for entertainment.  The variety of music on offer is  excellent.  My fave track has to be &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, ironically  a song U2 covered on their &quot;Rattle &amp; Hum&quot; album 20 years  later.  Other highlights for me include the brilliant opener (and Beach  Boys pastiche) &quot;Back In The USSR&quot;, along with &quot;Glass  Onion&quot;, &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, &quot;While My Guitar Gently  Weeps&quot; and &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; - the latter two songs proving  George Harrison's emerging talent as a songwriter.  I do not know if the CD  reissue lives up to my trusted vinyl copy (you don't get the photos and  giant poster for a start!) but this album is well worth buying if you  already own &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;Abbey  Road&quot;.  In fact is you already own these 3 titles, the White Album  should be your next purchase.
0679428887|1.0|Although I enjoyed his first two books, this one is a complete waste of time.  The plot is convoluted and ridiculous.  The characters are so poorly drawn you can barely keep them straight in your mind.  And the ending is so  ludicrous that it's laughable.  If you're looking for thrillers, there are  a lot better books out there.
B000002UYZ|5.0|This compilation, originally issued in 1973 (along with the &quot;1967-70&quot; compilation), is an excellent introduction to the classic pop music of the Beatles.  All the early hits are here for your  enjoyment, along with sone of the better album tracks.  If you do not own  any Beatles albums and want to delve into their rich musical heritage, as a  starting point these two albums make a very sensible purchase.  The only  minor criticism I have of this album is that EMI decided to include too  many songs from the &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; album and not enough from  &quot;Revolver&quot;.  Well worth the money all the same.
1878424319|5.0|&lt;The Four Agreements&gt; is a gem, both in its simplicity and its tremendously powerful message.  If you long for heart-centered advice which is easy to understand and follow, this is the book for you.  The Four  Agreements are wonderful stepping stones to happiness and personal power.   Each one reminds us of the ways in which we defeat ourselves by choosing to  justify our personal mythologies, or belief systems, even at the cost of  our own happiness.  The concept of making agreements with yourself  emphasises the way in which we can choose to react to our lives in a new  way just as, long ago, we made the choices that govern our lives now.  We  can choose to react to ourselves and our world out of love rather than  fear--with openness, rather than judgement--and we will reap all the  benefits of that attitude.<br />     What is just as wonderful as the simple  yet powerful tools Miguel shares with us is the way in which he shares  them.  His gentle, story-telling style puts you at ease, and brings you  into the dream of love that he lives every day.  The agreements Miguel  shares can apply to people in many different religious traditions or  secular ways of life.  Ask yourself:  Do you want to be happy?  This book  exposes the true source of happiness and suffering, and shows how to use  that knowledge.  If you are trying to make a change, or you feel that  something is missing in your life, make sure to read this book!
B000002UB6|2.0|Forget this over produced rubbish. If you really care about what this album SHOULD have sounded like, and what The Beatles had originally planned to release when they recorded the music for this set, look for the bootleg  CD 'GET BACK' which is far superior to this. Now Capitol, GET WITH IT.
6303460151|1.0|Anymore, when the name Robert Altman is raised, a bored lull enrapts the room--Pret-a-Porter is no exception.  This time Altman takes the audience on a two-hour tour of the pretentiousness of the fashion industry.  With no  apparant plot, the all-star cast is reduced to small talk (a key element in  any Altman film).  The mediocre and sparsely placed comedic moments are not  enough to keep the viewers attention for the duration of the film.  The  high point of the film came from Bassinger's deliberately bad southern  accent as she narrates this tale of sick photographers, perverse fashion,  and the effects alcohol has on two complete strangers.
630417893X|5.0|Nothing more can be added to what has been already said by the Braodway &amp; film critics and the general public. To remake this film today would be very difficult from the standpoint of finding the right talent and  experience for such a production. Hollywood is too much into the coarsening  up of the culture and making political statements to bring such a refined  flower to the screen. Making a sucessful screen adaptation of a Broadway  musical is perhaps the most difficult thing to do in the movie business.  Sadly film musical have not fared well with the public in the last 20-30  years. Hence, the studios are reluctant to make any new big-budget  efforts.<br />To the reviewer in Perth, Australia, Givenchy, my bloomin' a**.  It was designer/photographer Cecil Beaton who did the costume designs for  this film production.
B00000IQMT|4.0|I just saw the movie yesterday (I liked it but of course it lacks the smart alecky good humour of the previous Star Wars movies -- oh Han Solo, where are you?).  I bought the CD well before seeing the movie and thus it  was a bit tough for me to get into it at first but now after seeing the  movie, I'm giving this CD a qualified &quot;thumbs up.&quot; &quot;Duel of  Fates&quot; is innovative, exciting, and compelling and &quot;Anakin's  Theme&quot; is wonderful, especially with its subtle hints of Darth Vader's  theme.  There is also some solid battle music involving the Droids as well  as a few other solid tracks (&quot;The trip to the Naboo Temple,  &quot;Arrival at Naboo&quot;, &quot;The Appearance of Darth Maul&quot;).  However, I must agree with some of the other reviewers in that there is a  noticeable lack of memorable leitmotif music.  I would have liked to see  more memorable music for Queen Amidala, Qui-Gon, and for young Obi-Wan.   There is no one track that can match such Star Wars classics as Luke's  Theme, Lea's Theme, Ben's Theme, Darth Vader's Theme, etc.  &quot;Duel of  Fates&quot; comes close but no cigar.   Overall, the film and soundtracks  are solid entertainment but they come no where near to the quality of  Episode IV and V (I think even the most dedicated Star Wars fan would admit  the movie, while visually exciting, lacked a lot of humor and kick,  especially from the main characters who were upstaged by the computer  generated characters!). The music is also solid but I think John Williams  is going to have a tough time winning another Oscar for his effort...a good  effort, but not one of his best.
0887306667|5.0|This is a fun, easy-to-read and thought-provoking book on Marketing for the ordinary person.  <br />Who wants stuffy theorys when there are so many wonderful real-world examples?  You probably already know most, if not all  of the cited case studies, so you can nod your head and say, &quot;yep,  that's right--that's exactly what happened.&quot;  <br />I've already given  away over a dozen copies to friends, customers and colleagues.
B00000BKI4|2.0|I too was lured into buying this grand bit of nothing by the lock-step critical acclaim. While I agree that there are nice sonic touches here and there, and some of the instrumental bits are just this side of interesting,  the rest of it sounds like Al &quot;Year of the Cat&quot; Stewart's big  comeback record. Ugh. I mean, honestly, has it come to this?
B0000033RY|5.0|Never has a band cut to heart of the matter in the style that Cactus did. Todays musicians should all take a hard listen to this band, Tim Bogart and Carmine Appice laid down the bottom, and took it over the top. Rusty Days  balls out style was as refreshing as it was infectious. Jimmy McCarty is  the consumate guitarist. This is a man who epitomizes mastery of his craft.  His latest efforts are with a Detroit based blues band called Mystery  Train....pick it up and give it a listen, latest release is titled Love  Lost....it is fantastic. His work after Cactus , with the group the Rockets  also showcase his incredible talents.He has worked with Bob Seeger and many  others, why he is not acclaimed as he should be is beyond me, and a true  shame. After thirty years I still slip in the cactus tapes and wonder at  the talent and energy of these guys.
0446310786|5.0|I really liked this book,and recommend to anyone who likes &quot;southern&quot; type books, or just a good book! Read it y'all! :)
B00000J7SO|5.0|Written and released just prior to his embracing of Christian faith, Dylan sings with a passion that says, &quot;I'm in the dark, facing the light, with both eyes open...&quot;.  The album is desperate, yearning, broken,  dark, and crying out for deliverance....beautiful love songs from a broken  heart...
0553278355|5.0|The Bell Jar is an increadibly understandable account of the experiences of a woman as she goes insane. Through every word of the book, I could almost rationalize her feelings as she goes insane. Seeing her life through  her eyes, she dosn't seem as insane as she may actually have been. The  mindset of The Bell Jar is so different from what that which we feel on a  regular daily basis, but while reading the book you almost begin to think  like Esther. The Bell Jar is one of the very few books that can take a  serious, fictional approach to real-life insanity. And of course, the bell  jar may have lifted off of Esther at the end of the book, but it obviously  did once again descend on Sylvia Plath.

B000001Y2U|5.0|I rememeber placing the 17 bucks on the counter and walking away with an album that i was entirely not ready to experience.  I put the album on my cheap stereo, which just so happened to be about 3/4 of the way up on the  dial and let it regurgitate exactly what seduction was on that compact  disc.  I didnt stop that album for five damn days. Most of the time i left  the stereo still at 3/4.  Must be the most original and stabbing, yet faint  and castrateful, yet disembowling and graceful  . .  album i own.     (and  i own more cds than spaces in this paragraph) It took me on turns and spins  i never conceived as possible. I believe more people would open up to  appreciate originality in music if they bought this album . . and could get  past their insecurity of not understanding.  Stabbing and Devouring guitar  shoved up by crunched, popped, and dispositional rhythm . .  only enhance  the already infamous voice of Marilyn Manson. One in a kind theme and  lyrics . .   if anything i can guarantee that you will not be able to find  another album like this. period.   If god himself came down to behold this  cd . .  open minded ( might be tough for him ) im 100 percent sure hed say  . .  &quot; damn man . .  this rocks! &quot;
6304467583|5.0|Mr. or Ms.  DurerOriel<br />This great trilogy is actually available in widescreen and includes interviews with the pincipals.  You can order it by going to a popular mail order site for books, movies, etc.
B000001E8S|5.0|Eno really stretches out on this great collaborative effort!  You really won't believe the sounds coming out of your stereo.  Tracks 2 - 7 are an organic whole, sweeping the listener up, down, and through emotional and  psychedelic peaks and valleys, culminating in an amazing operatic solo from  none other than Pavarotti (!).  Bono's ego is gratefully subdued and he  makes a fine contribution on vocals.  Great guitar work - awesome sonic  treatments.  A wonderful achievement!
B000002H6C|5.0|This is simply metallica's best album ever.  Unlike most reviews here i dont have much of a problem with the sound quality and the songs are the most intelligent and musically sophisticated they have written to date.  It  a shame that they have taken such a departure to this type of metal.  The  best songs are: To live is to die, One, Harvester of sorrow, Blackened and  Dyer's eve

630512065X|5.0|First, let me talk about what was wrong with this video. Okay, that done, on with the good.  The music of ALW is fantastic and (to me)habit forming. It actually stirs feelings inside me that no rock and roll songs could ever  do.  The cast all play their parts to purrfection, with some standouts like  J Brent, Rosemarie Ford, and Jo Gibb.  Also, when you see it, you will  remember &quot;Victoria&quot; for a long time.  She can really dance.   Also have made some great friends who feel as I do,  such as Jellicle Frank.  He has given me some great insights into the  video. Please, at least see it once.  You'll know why they say &quot;Cats   Now and Forever&quot;<br />Broadway John

B00000DFMM|5.0|I came across this album in 1985, intrigued by the cover, I purchased it...the best blind purchase I ever made! Murder of Love is perhaps the best song I have ever heard! I've since become a collector of all thing  Propaganda,Act and Claudia Brucken! Not enough stars for my rating!!!

B000002R0R|5.0|Imagine a new wave band in the 70's whose members had chops galore and could play everything from Bach counterpoint to Miles Davis fusion.<br />This cd contains the music that would have been produced by such a  band.<br />Ironically, if a new band had of released such music or Gentle  Giant had of recorded it under a new name, it probably would have gotten  rave reviews, instead of being treated as a sellout by their fans and  ignored by the press as music by a &quot;dinosaur band&quot;<br />The closest  Cd that sounds close to this is Jethro Tull's Crest of a Knave which was  released over 10 years later and was nominated for a Grammy  award.<br />Despite the first silly track, &quot;Two weeks in Spain&quot;,  this Cd contains all the elements of Gentle Giant that was great (counter  point, time changes, amazing vocals) about them with an element of rock  added.<br />Pity they could not have kept it up and recorded two other lps  &quot;Giant for a Day&quot; and &quot;Civillian&quot; which the rock  gradually overrode any progressiveness, and turned them into another pop  rock band
0380730405|4.0|This is a FABULOUS book--except that for the first 200 pages literally nothing exciting happens.  All that's going on is that Mrs. Danvers hates the girl (whose name we never find out) with an undying passion.  Until I  found out Max's deep dark secret, I almost fell asleep reading  this.  But  after that it's interesting.<br />Another aspect I didn't like was the lack of  any kind of real relationship between the two main characters.  They're  married, right?  And they kiss maybe twice.  It's wrong.  (In my opinion,  anyway.)  But I think it made for interesting Freudian analysis of  Max.<br />The back of this book insists that it's filled with romantic  suspense, and it is.  And it's even worth sitting through the first 200  pages.
B0000024VP|5.0|&quot;Ferris Wheel&quot; and  &quot;Three Kingfishers&quot; are two of the best songs Donovan wrote, and more than enough reason to buy the disc.  They have a certain breezy, seductive, summery, nostalgic feel that's never  been captured as good anywhere else. While a lot Donovan albums are better  left on the rack, this one is consistantly beautiful and his best alongside  of the saddly unavailable (on Disc) &quot;Mellow Yellow&quot; - another  sweet and atmospheric gem.
0446310786|5.0|This book is amazingly apt at telling about Scout's (I hate to say &quot;loss of innocence&quot;; it's so clichd)...I guess you could say &quot;transformation to womanhood.&quot;  The courtroom scenes, the subtle  (and sometimes not-so-subtle) racism, and the symbolism are exquisite.
0684833395|4.0|i found catch-22 to be well written, but i found the humour very bland and utterly repetitive, even though the main theme of the novel is Yossarian being cast around and around again in the circle of catch-22. the only  reason why i am giving this four stars, it would be three without this, is  because of why it makes so much sense for Orr's whore hitting him over the  head with her shoe: she paid him.
B000002MG1|5.0|This album is full of great songs and proves yet again that REM is never afraid to take a new path and create the music they need to make.  Any fan of REM's unique brand of soulful, alternative rock is sure to love this  album and &quot;Nightswimming&quot;, in particular, will rip your heart  out.  Of course, Peter Buck was nice enough to pose for a picture with my  baby daughter once and I'm a little prejudiced, I guess.  What a guy.
0790739909|4.0|This movie was truly captivating.  The portrayal of &quot;angels&quot; was fresh and different even contrary to conventional perceptions of angels.  I think it is a beautiful (although tragic) movie.  It made me realize how  lucky I am to be able to enjoy the simple pleasures that life has to offer.   This is one movie that I will take with me for a long time.
0899663036|5.0|I could not put this book down!  I always wanted to know what was to become of Francie and her family.  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is rich in details about everything, from Francie's view of Brooklyn to the people she  encounters.  I really felt like I knew the characters, and could understand  what it was like to live their lives.
B00000IL1K|3.0|Although I'm not particularly fond of some of the songs, I thought it was worth getting because it's a joy, &amp; interesting, to hear her sing.  I enjoy it, but my co-workers keep turning it off!
044022165X|5.0|Realistic and emotional. Portraits perfectly how common people live and work, we identify with the characters and their problems. Best Grisham ever!. Avoid the movie though.
B00000IQMT|5.0|20 years later, John Williams is still composing the same kind of great, epic music needed for movies like Star Wars.  It's too bad the soundtrack is better than the movie itself.....
0451452739|5.0|I just want to remind everyone who has read the book and/or seen the movie of something: The book is ARTHUR C. CLARKE'S interpretation of Kubrick's movie. The truth is that no one know exactly why Kubrick did certain things  in his amazing film, not even Clarke. So if you read the book for  clarification of the movie, keep in mind that it isn't explaining Kubrick's  film, it is simply an interpretation, which (after reading Kubrick's great  biography by Vincent LoBrutto)probably isn't even very accurate. The book  is great, and will help your understanding, but it isn't the Bible.
1563890119|5.0|It's hard to review just one book of the series 'cause they are part of a larger story. Gaiman uses fables and myths and converts them to a  modern story which at the same time feels like a ancient fary tale. If you have  the chance watch Neverwhere, it's a BBC series about a world below modern  Londen.
068815333X|5.0|This is a very intense novel and it makes you shudder at the evil people can possess.  Very good read, but I did miss Angie in the beginning.  A must read for the beach, bedtime, bus, etc.... Okay Dennis, when is your  next one?
B000002VCO|3.0|There sure are some great songs. &quot;Since the Last Good-bye&quot; &quot;Don't Answer Me&quot; may be even the best of their career. But I have to say there too are some not-so-needed songs, maybe because there are  no definite concept on this one. So when I try to listen trough the whole  album, I found it not easy, although, it may worth money only for those  two.
1573226521|5.0|This book was nauseatingly close to home.  In our generation of the anti-tourist,  the travel culture has become such an exotic way of life, this book was a true reminder of the dangers that most romantic travelers  forget to acknowledge. Having travelled extensively through Asia this book  took me back to the &quot;travel culture&quot; i once felt so much a part  of, but have lost to the throes of corporate America; 9 to 5.  This book  made me nostalgic for the adventurer in me, and has helped me once again  re-think the mundane life of 9 to 5.
B000006ZL4|5.0|Who the hell needs Dream Theater to give us progressive metal....this disc makes Images and Words sound like John Lithgow's new CD of childrens songs!  Michael Romeo is a sick and viscious guitar player..and this disc shows of  his amazing talent.  The songs are well structured and relentless.  Even  the title track (clocking in at just over 20 minutes!) will hold you in  silence from begining to end....you won't realize the time is up.  This is  their heaviest disc to date...and it F*cking Rocks!  **Rumor has it there  is a US deal in the works!

0380973464|4.0|First, I want to say I loved this book.  I couldn't put it down, and the computer and crypto details made the novel truly interesting.  The characters were deep and drew me into the story.   <br />However, the ending  was the only part I didn't like.  I thought that while the book was  well-written overall, it lacked closure at the end.  After reading 910  pages in about 24 hours, I wanted to hear that all the characters were  happy, and that the business venture succeeded, etc.  I felt like an  epilogue or something would have been nice, just to give a sense of  finality.  <br />The interview says that this novel is the first of a series.   If there isn't more about the characters, I'm going to be rather  disappointed.

6304385668|3.0|Although this movie wasn't supported by the reviewers, I think it was an excellent attempt to puzzle through an impossibly complex (still) situation in Ireland.  For those of us with English, Scotch-Irish and Irish ancestry,  it gives us a little perspective.  How could these people from these tiny  adjacent islands hate one another so?  Having seen 'Mary, Queen of Scots',  I also had some perspective for how long the hatreds have gone back.   The  loyalty of the men to one another was something our  modern day politicians  could learn from.  Alan Rickman played the cold, calculating but  nonetheless, brave leader of the rebels.  He plays these unsympathetic  parts beautifull, as he allows the viewer to have some compassion for what  is obviously one of the 'bad guy' roles in the movie.   Julie Roberts lost  her Irish accent halfway through, and was a poor choice for the role.  But  I frankly think a love interest was important to give some relief to the   unremitting eternal enmity that exists among fellow Irishmen and their  English 'overlords'.   It's still a puzzle, but a wee bit more  understandable to a girl from the South, who has seen its' own stupid war.  Alice Copeland Brown
B000006OBQ|4.0|A nice album...lots of energy here....a bit raspy at times
B000004B9S|4.0|The mood of this work is intentionally melancholic. Some songs have beautiful melodies, others are little more than &quot;ambient&quot; music, but all are superbly arranged and performed. Echoes of Cocteau Twins and  Dead Can Dance abound, and you will like this CD if you like these groups.  Well before the new age and ethnic craze, TMC anticipated a popular trend,  while managing to avoid the kitch that pervades the genre.
0684803356|5.0|Hi, I'm a 19 year old pre-collge student who just recently read this book. I didn't think I was going to like it at all, but I became soooo captivated that I just couldn't put it down. It has fast became my favorite book. I  never thought I would love a book about Spanish civil war! But this book is  wonderful; it has betrayal, love, war and death in it. I recomend it to  anyone and everyone! You'll love it! And I hope you love it half as much as  I do.
0345350499|5.0|I read a neighbors' copy as a preteen and it changed my life! A twist on the traditional Authurian myth; Bradely gave me women who were strong, confident and magical.

B000000FG8|1.0|This music is stupid just like the people who listen to it. Gimme a break and buy some good Christian gossip rock.  JUST KIDDING. I like this cd. It's my band and I don't want anyone else to buy it, so go buy something  else. I don't want this band to go mainstream! Thank You, thank you very  much.
0788816454|5.0|This movie is one of Adam Sandlers best movies yet It was exciting and funny
B000002MFN|3.0|I admire this cd more than I really enjoy it.  Don't get me wrong, there are some excellent tunes...&quot;Erotica&quot;, &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, &quot;Waiting&quot; come to mind...but just as many songs make the cd come  to a screeching hault...&quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Where Life Begins&quot;,  and &quot;Did You Do It&quot; to name a few.  Still you have to hand it to  Madonna for (if nothing else) being adventurous.  She explores topics that  few artists would dare to address and this cd does have a certain sleezy  appeal.  This in my opinion is of the few Madonna cds that is worth your  time, the other being the wonderful &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;.
B000002WYT|5.0|Nobody makes better music than DMB. Their chops, creativity, maturity, and musicianship pushes them to an untouchable plane beyond today's teeny bopper crowded music scene. For those who have been fortunate to see them  live in concert, you are able to see that CD's can't begin to harness the  power of this band.<br />DMB simply makes the loveliest music around today.  Check out Crash, Say Goodbye, Cry Freedom, and Proudest Monkey. These are  particularly powerful songs on this album. <br />Anybody who can write an  entertaining song about monkeys gets my attention anytime.<br />Rock on Dave!
0440217563|5.0|Diana Gabaldon has kept me enthralled with her story.  I spent many a late night reading because I could not wait to find out what was going to happen next.  She makes the characters so real you come away feeling like you know  them personally.  Truly a wonderful story.

0790736314|5.0|I remember back in 1973 when I first saw &quot;The Exorcist&quot; at the drive-in with my mom and dad; I had trouble for weeks going to sleep and even then I had to have a night light!  Now, 25 years later, this one movie  still has the power to produce in me disturbing dreams whenever I watch it.   The horrific images of the possessed Regan McNeil forever seared into my  consciousness aside, one truly heart-grabbing scene between Chris McNeil  (Ellyn Burstyn) and Father Karras (Jason Miller) when Chris implores Karras  to &quot;help her, please help her!&quot; (referring to Regan) and disolves  into a sobbing heap.  Chris' agony is so palpable at that moment, that  anyone watching the movie will feel the despair, the sense of powerlessness  one feels when faced with the unknown; one also feels the unbending iron  will of Father Merrin (Max von Sydow), commanding the demon to &quot;BE  SILENT!&quot; when it began spewing obscenities at him.  William Friedkin's  frightening, disturbing vision that is &quot;The Exorcist&quot; continues  to haunt the dreams of a new generation of movie-watchers.  It is  definitely one movie to watch with ALL the lights in the house on!
B00000ICD9|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out.  I thought surely with Robin Williams it would be great.  How wrong I was!!!  This movie is soooooo weird!  You'll feel like you've taken acid(along with the director)  and wonder what in the world the director was thinking when he wrote it.   Even if there was a story, there was so much strangeness that you can't pay  attention to it.
078322172X|5.0|This movie is much better the second time through. The way the end ties in with the beginning is absolutely haunting!  This movie is one you will talk about after watching it.  Rent it today!!
B000002BFZ|5.0|\\"no code\\" has long been notorious as pearl jam's worst album, but i'm not so sure. the album has style and substance, while allowing the band to explore various styles of music. the understated \\"off he goes\\" may be the most underappreciated track in the pearl jam catatlog, with ament and gossard sounding as beautiful as ever. \\"smile\\" finds vedder exposing himself with wry cynicism. and \\"sometimes\\" is like a quiet fuse that explodes with emotion to begin a nice collection of songs.
B000002HRE|1.0|i, LOOOOVVVEEEE metallica, but this cd is a serious fall. what happened to the sweet solo we loved to hear in the middle of the song? to some percussion instead of the same 3 lines over and over again? unforgiven 2 is  a disgrace to unforgiven one. it's still good though. but you cannot  compare this trash to any other of metallica's cd's. i expected a lot more  of metallica, i wanted some metal not a catchy crap like the memory  remains. metallica aimed for money and not for art this time. i hope garage  inc. is better, haven't got it yet. for metallica's sake, i hope it's  better.
B00000IQMT|5.0|I've been an avid fan of John Williams for a long time now.  I believe his score to &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; to be one of his greatest works.  The first time I heard any of the score was on a special of 20/20.  They did a  special on the sounds of the movie.  I caught a few seconds of &quot;Duel  of Fates&quot; being performed.  The music immediately evoked visions of  Jedi Knights and Sith Lords battling with light sabres.  I bought the score  the first day it was released.  Some people have been very critical of this  score however.  This suprized me quite a lot.  The two most common  complaints are that Williams didn't use much material from the previous  &quot;Star Wars&quot; scores.  And that it wasn't very well presented on  the album.  I believe the score as it stands was perfect for the film.  The  idea of using the rebel fanfare, or Princes Leia's theme, or many of the  other familiar songs from the other films would have been incorrect.  There  was enough familiar in the music for it to be a full part of the Star Wars  saga.  But, new material had to be written.  Simple re-orchestration of  familiar themes would have been useless.  Take for example the difference  in the scores of &quot;A New Hope&quot; and &quot;Empire Strikes  Back.&quot;  Accept for a few seconds of music, and the main title, it was  an entirely new score. I do agree the album could have been presented  better.  But, &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; like the other Star Wars scores  will undoubtably be re-released in a two cd album.  Not to mention the  number of remakes other orchestras will make of this album.  In my humble  opinion John Williams has lived up to the expectation of excellence yet  again.    Mhalky Chris
B000002UAI|5.0|Listen again, folks: &quot;No Reply&quot; &quot;I Don't Want to Spoil the Party&quot; &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; - any of these songs could have been hit *singles*, yet here they are hiding in this splendid album. Listen  to these brisk, warm performances of &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;,  &quot;Kansas City&quot; and &quot;Words of Love&quot;... just grand.
B000006NPY|4.0|I'm with billy on this record. His dark goth sound creeping back. We lost that the past few records, and here its dark clouds and fog all over again.  Some songs creep, and others whine, but all in all it succeeds. It's also  sad to see fans turn on a band just becuase it's not what they've come to  expect. Oh well, if the pumpkins put out a hundred albums like this one.  I'd buy ever one.
0553573411|5.0|Every one that is insulting this book, and saying not to read it should calm down. It's a great book, they just take it too seriously. I think the author did a great job. I would also like to know how old everyone is that  is reading these books.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is one of the BEST CD of MetallicA, racing up with Justice Master and Black. all of you that think MetallicA is good because of reload are just missing the point. reload, load, garage inc. those cd's are not the essence  of MetallicA. I personally think they are not nearly as good as MetallicA  should have made them. but the true heavy metal is Ride the lightining. and  if you love MetallicA, the true MetallicA you gotta have this CD. this is  one of the only cd's that i LOVE each and every song in it. from fight fire  to fire to call of ktulu. this is the first cd of MetallicA i've heard and  since then i'm in love with this band. even though reload has spoiled it.
6305265488|5.0|Ever After was a WONDERFUL movie for children about 11 and up I'd say.  There was a great plot, a great ending, and great characters.  Anyone who hasn't seen it, rent or buy this movie now.
B000002UAX|5.0|The reviewer from Wyoming's logic seems to be: &quot;this album wasn't performed live, so it's bad.&quot; Such logic, need I say? is extremely flawed. Or perhaps he is saying &quot;this group didn't perform live,  therefore one of their albums is bad.&quot; This too is flawed. Please let  us consider the album we have here at hand, made in the studio, just like  practically every other rock album in history. The reviewer from Olympia,  Washington apparently dismisses this album because he doesn't understand  the lyrics, in which case maybe he should take an English class.  Listen,  folks, what we have here is a work of fundamental quality, beautifully  performed and produced, filled with cleverly suggestive ambiguities,  fun-filled parody, wide appeal, and such intelligent turns of melody that  they warrant comparison with Schubert.
0684833395|5.0|This book is the only book I have ever read that made me laugh openly. I laughed throughout the book but by the time I got to the end I wasn't laughing anymore. The irony of the story is beautifully blended with the  comedy. A MUST for anyone who likes a good book and a good laugh.
B00000G28U|1.0|why do we, the old metallica fans, have to be insulted with this fake music?? what happened to metallica i sang with a loud and clear voice with another 50,000 people &quot;DIE DIE DIE&quot;... what happened to the  lyrics which had meaning? don't buy it so you won't have to be so  dissapointed. as i am now.
0783217048|5.0|This Movie is a wonderful portrayl of how a new idea, can influence a whole town. Snydersville will come to life, before your eyes, with the help of Vida, Noxema, and Chi-Chi. The moral of the story is a moral I now use  in life &quot;Just Be Yourself!&quot; It is destined to become a classic of  the modern queen time.
B000002KNI|4.0|One can't fault any of the material here, these are great songs competently performed by a big band. One senses that Simon was only trying to do his own concert here, since so many of the songs are his solo  seventies material; indeed, when he had another such concert in 1990,  Garfunkel was left out of it altogether. One senses the strain in the  relationship at the time of this premature reunion. But hell, they're good.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is truly one of the greatest CD's ever written!  The music stirrs at the soul with haunting lyrics that capture you.  Best if listened in surround sound, this album explores more than just the anger brought out by  Undertow.  It expresses an unique look at a dark world that we all  sometimes wish would be cleaned by a flood.  Third Eye is a masterpiece and  no one sings quite like Maynard.  A definite must-buy!
B000002HRE|2.0|what happened to the music? the lyrics? the guitar rising above all with a solo that brings tears to your eyes? all is lost, for what, for this??? metallica PLEASE stop this crap! i'm a metallica fun, i must say i won't  stay one if another reload comes out.
B000001FXR|5.0|Bob Marleys Island debut from 1973 is a classic.  It includes &quot;Slave driver&quot; and &quot;Kinky reggae&quot;, some of Bob's best work.  This LP demonstrates raw, coarse reggae and a true sense of roots, which I feel,  despite their overall quality are all but forgotten in later albums like  Exodus(1977) and Kaya(1979).  Besides Bob's vocals, the excelent baritone  qualities of Peter McIntosh's voice are excelently expressed in &quot;Stop  that train&quot;.  This album is a reggae great and is an essential for a  good collection.  Others include &quot;The harder they come&quot; and  &quot;Funky Kingston&quot; By Toots
0553277472|5.0|I've had to buy 3 copies of this book. The first two were loaned to friends who never returned them. Yes, it's a great book. It's not about Zen or motorcycles. It is about quality, values, and relationships.<br />I first  read ZMM 18 years ago, at age 17. Since then, I've been impressed by 3  things about the book: 1)It's one of those books that you can pick up after  not touching for 5 years, and end up spending hours rereading sections on a  rainy afternoon. 2) It's one of those books that when you meet someone who  also read &amp; loved it, and then discuss it with them, it always seems  that they got something different out of it than you did. 3) You can pick  it up after not reading it for 10 years, re-read it, and it's as though  you've just read a completely different book.<br />Many reviewers here have  stated that reading the book changed their lives. I read it at a pretty  impressionable time, so I can't say as how my life would've been different  if I hadn't read it. I do believe though that reading the book did teach me  at least one absolute truth: There are two types of people in the world-  people who love ZMM, and people who &quot;just don't get it&quot;. If I'm  ever marooned on an island with one other person, I pray it's one of the  former.
B000000993|5.0|If it wasn't for Sober, I never would have discovered such an awesome band.  I went out and bought the CD and never looked back.  Never have lyrics expressed so much pain that everyone can relate to.  4 degrees and  flood are the best this CD has to offer, next to Sober of course.  Maynard  has a true gift in bringing across his lyrics with such a talented voice.   And the music as always adds that extra dimension.  Very powerful!
079074161X|5.0|This film definitely gets 5 stars.  It was awesome.  Max is back and nobody can mess with him and get away with it.  This is definitely the best of the 3 films.  Max wanders through the outback, looking for gasoline in  his black Ford Falcon Interceptor and helps a small colony of people defend  themselves against a gang of vermon that are out to kill the colonists and  take all their fuel.  This is a great post-nuclear war movie and it really  makes you think about what it would really be like, if we did have a war.  There are great stunt scenes in this film that still haven't been topped  today.  I would definitely recommend this film and if you buy it, get the  letterbox edition.
0140186409|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY THAT COULD EVEN APPROACH THE JUSTICE THIS BOOK DESERVES. &quot;THE GRAPES OF WRATH&quot; IS A SHEAR TOUCHSTONE IN BEAUTY AND HONESTY THAT TRAVELS THROUGH EVER EMOTION THE HUMAN SPIRIT HAS EVER EXPERIENCED.  WITH THE INTERCHAPTERS WAXING PHILOSOPHIC, AND THE CHAPTERS THEMSELVES  BROADCASTING THE HORROR AND DEVASTATION OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION ON A  MICROCOSMIC LEVEL, A BALANCE OF PURE AWE AND MAGESTY IS STRUCK WITH THE  READER. IF YOU WISH TO CONSIDER YOURSELF AMERICAN, OR, HELL, EVEN AN  EMPATHIC HUMAN BEING, YOU WILL READ THIS TRUE MONUMENT IN LITURATURE.
B00000ILBK|5.0|As far as the Srar Trek goes, it is not the best. But it is definitely worth having on DVD. The sound and visual effects are very impressive. The battle scenes seemed to lack a climax, they leave you hanging. But I really  enjoyed it non-the-less.
B00000HZFH|4.0|Had no idea about this band until they were recommended by a friend.  &quot;Carry the Zero&quot; is one of the best pop tunes I've heard in a LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG time.  The album is a very surprising treat.
B000006N61|3.0|I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars.  The Road Warrior (part 2), is much better.  I am an auto-mechanic and a car buff, so I particulary love the car scenes in this movie, especially Max's black Ford Falcon Interceptor.  Even though the blower on the engine is fake, you still love the car and  how Max wipes out the motorcycle gang with it.  This is a good movie, but  make sure you get the original version, where all the voices aren't dubbed  over.
B000001ELR|4.0|I think this is one of Kiss' best albums.  The only other records that can compare to this one are Alive and Rock And Roll Over.  <br />All the songs here are really strong, especially &quot;I Love It Loud,&quot; &quot;War  Machine,&quot; and &quot;Saint And Sinner.&quot;  I even like Paul's  ballad, &quot;I Still Love You.&quot;  &quot;Keep Me Comin'&quot; and  &quot;Killer&quot; are also killer tracks (sorry about the pun).  Gene  really does a great job of song writing on this album, turning what could  have been a so-so effort into a classic.  I know that every Kiss album has  at least one clunker, and &quot;Danger&quot; fills that role here...it's so  shrill, it just grates the nerves.  I don't really care for the title track  either; it's not a bad song...it's just weak compared to the rest of the  album.<br />Eric Carr shows why he is a far better drummer than Peter Criss  could ever hope to be (if you don't believe me, listen to the pathetic  drumming on Psycho Circus).  Carr is nothing short of phenomenal here.  I  haven't heard anything this good since John Bonham of Led Zeppelin  died.<br />This is definitely heavy metal Kiss.  Creatures is heavier than  anything they released since Alive.  If you're looking for the toned-down  teeny-bopper Kiss that made albums like Dynasty, Unmasked, or Psycho  Circus, forget this album.  If you like Revenge or Alive, get this  one...you'll love it.
B0000039LE|5.0|HALLOWEEN is, in my opinion, the best horror film ever made. Why? Because up until the final scene of the movie, it's not all that fake.  Michael Myers, the best slasher of them all. The mask is fantastic. John  Carpenter's music is also a key to the film's success. Jamie Lee Curtis and  Donald Pleasance do a great job in this low budget movie. If you like  horror and haven't seen HALLOWEEN, you're being deprived my friend!
0375707972|4.0|This book spoke to me in a way that few do.  The way the author used the language and described certain situations were absolutely relatable.  &quot;The Reader&quot; should be missed by no one.  It's a fast easy read  and should be picked up for a beach day book.....it won't  disappoint.......kris/nj
B000001DTM|5.0|This is the most incredible and astonishing album I've heard in my life (And I heard a lot!). This is not just a Rock album, it's a new genre! A sole music style surrounded by the junk of the '90s.<br />It is so good that  it makes other great artists, like R.E.M., Van Morrison, Pink Floyd or Led  Zeppelin, look pathetic. My favourite track is &quot;The Fly&quot;, an  amazing song. Other good tracks are &quot;Even Better Than The Real  Thing&quot;, &quot;Until The End of The World&quot; and &quot;One&quot;.  However, every song in this album is great.<br />This is a very rare  masterpiece. Probably the best Rock album in the last 50 years. It's really  unfortunate, but I find it hard to believe that I'd ever hear something  like this again.<br />This is a classic. It must be in every house!
6300216039|5.0|This movie speaks for itself. It is absolutely timeless for the breathtaking beauty and wide-eyed innocence of Olivia Hussey as Juliet, the lush cinematography, the moving and haunting musical score from Nina  Rota, the costumes and fine casting -  all combine to create an indelible  movie experience. You feel that you are being transported back to the 16th century, and consumed by the inchoate passion and,   ultimately, the  tragedy of these two 'star-crossed' lovers. This film seens to invade all  your senses, and is so all-encompassing that it transcends description.
0780623703|5.0|I loved it from start to finish. This was a highly creative movie that was incredible. Yes I know, others have downed it, but that doesn't change my opinion. Pleasentville was smart, witty, charming, and dramatic. The  message is clear and displyed very well. The acting is fabulous, especially  Joan Allen. She is an amazing actress and deserved a Academy Award  nomination. The costumes are great, the visual effects are incredible, and  the score is quite pleasent. This movie touched me and will remain my  favorite of '98
079213690X|5.0|By far, the best movie I have ever experienced.  Who gives a fly rat's ace if it is historically accurate?
0790734060|5.0|This movie is the best I have ever seen. I absolutely fell in love with it. There is no bad aspect about this movie. The acting was superb. The costumes and scenery were the some of the best I have ever seen. This movie  really takes you back to Mozart's century and makes you feel for both of  the leading men. This movie is also very funny. There are a couple of scens  that will make you chuckle and smile. The music is absolutely fabulous and  is weaved into the movie beautifully. I never once got bored with this  movie. It definitely deserved its spot on the Top 100 films and will remain  great. Everyone should watch this movie. It will really touch you. It shall  remain my all time favorite movie.
0380973464|3.0|A book that really disappointed me, after reading his article in WIRED about the mechanics of running cable underwater (which was great) I thought this book would be a classic.
B0000025KI|5.0|This 2 cd set, along with Darkness on the Edge of Town, is essential for any music collection.  The River is full of great tunes to sit back on the back porch, pour up your favorite beverage, and kick back enjoy.
6305364648|3.0|Not the best of Cameron or Arnold, but it looks and sounds nice for a pleasing, mindless flick that barely deserves a purchase unless you're a hardcore fan of the director or stars.  If you're a Buffy The Vampire  Slayer fan, it's a good chance to check out Eliza Dushku(the second Slayer,  &quot;Faith,&quot; on the show) in one of her early roles as the rebellious  daughter.
B0000009SM|5.0|I never thought I could ever enjoy any rock album more than &quot;Joe's Garage&quot; until I first heard &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; in 1992.  Though lacking the delicous humor which is one of the trademarks of your  typical Zappa recording, the ingenious musical composition one discovers on  this CD more than makes up for it.      If you consider yourself as someone  with very good taste in music (meaning &quot;Boston's Greatest Hits&quot;  is not part of your collection) but never really felt an appreciation for  Zappa, try this CD anyway.  Five others I would recommend are &quot;Hot  Rats&quot;, &quot;Apostrophe&quot;, &quot;Sheik Yer Booty&quot;, &quot;Zoot  Allures&quot;( heavy metal alla Zappa) and &quot;Bongo Fury&quot; -- just  to get you started.
6301773551|1.0|Let me get right to the point. Star Wars is not a great movie. I think it's pretty stupid. Yes, I did see it and The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. And guess what? I wasn't impressed. Sure, the special  effects were good, and the sound was very high tech. But ya know what? The  acting is terrible. The plot was shallow. And there was no character  identification. (Unless you somehow identify with people wanting to take  over the universe.)  This movie was an exploitation of special effects. I'm  serious. If you took all the special effects out of the movie you would be  left with trash. Take Titanic. It had wonderful special effects. If you  took them out you still had a wonderful story with human emotions. Star  Wars may be fun, but it's also a kiddie movie for adults who haven't yet  grown up.
B000002UAU|5.0|What can I possibly say about &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; that hasn't been said before by the wisest men of the world?  Listen to it forwards, listen to it backwards, and enjoy it over and over.  It's great the first time you  listen to it, and remarkably, it grows on you even more after that.  Tracks  like &quot;Getting Better&quot; and &quot;A  Day in the Life&quot; are  Beatle masterpieces, not to mention the fun and musically-perfect  &quot;When I'm 64,&quot; &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; and  &quot;She's Leaving Home.&quot;  This CD is solid start to finish, and is a  must-have for any music fan's collection--even if you don't normally get  into the &quot;oldies.&quot;
B000002UXZ|5.0|Music to heal the soul. And I think that's something everyone could use
0140328726|5.0|I like this book because fantastic Mr. Fox always gets around Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.  I especially like the part where there's a race between the tractor and the foxes and the part when they sneak into chicken house,  the store house and the Bean's secret cider cellar. (Timmy-age 9)
078322706X|5.0|Woody Allen has attempted many existential films that acknowledge both death and the miraculous existence of life. Meet Joe Black takes Woody Allens themes and presents them in a risky - but quite successful -  directing style. This film will become one of the classics of American  cinema. Enjoy the realization of the potential of American cinema!
B00000AFFF|5.0|This album is, simply, stunning. As a fan of Elvis Costello since 1977 and a fan of Burt's since I first heard &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot;, this is the record I have been praying for. That it not only answers those  prayers but does so much more is a miracle. <br />These songs are about  heartbreak and despair; things that these two men seem to have an  unnervingly deep understanding of. I realised that they had &quot;found my  letters and read each one out loud&quot; in a way I haven't experienced  since Dylan's &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;. <br />The music is sweet, but  not saccharine, and the lyrics are always perfectly phrased. The  combination of the two can be emotionally overpowering. I can't listen to  the end of &quot;My Thief&quot;, beautifully sung by one of the backing  singers, without crying. <br />As for whether or not this is a  &quot;classic&quot;, well just listen to &quot;Toledo&quot; three times and  then try to get it out of your head. <br />The criticism of Costello's voice  is banal. The man has a genuinely expressive way of singing and a greater  range than he is given credit for. His attack, especially on &quot;The  Sweetest Punch&quot; and &quot;God Give Me Strength&quot; is awesome.  <br />This is clearly the album of the decade - hands down; no other  contenders come anywhere near it.
B000006NPY|4.0|It is good to see that the Pumpkins have a HUGE range when it comes to musical talent. While others may dismiss Billy Corgan as a whiny sissy, I believe this album shows that a rock band can produce good songs without  making your ears bleed.
067101756X|4.0|Hey folks,lets get real.....everyone knows that the government is constantly hiding secrets from the general public.Corso has told an interesting and engaging story recounting the events leading to the  technology explosion of the last half century.The book is written with a  confidence that suggests to the reader the imformation is real.Its true  that some of the imformation seems far fetched even for true  believers,however Corso manages to keep the imformation flowing with  thoughts of his own.Perhaps the biggest surprise to me was the fact that  Corso actually uses names of real individuals and he will probably use the  royalties from the book to pay for all the law suits that he will get.Buy  the book,its a great read.
B000000WJZ|4.0|This is an excellent CD by the Smashing Pumpkins, though it is not as goo as Mellon Collie
6302101743|4.0|The Valley Of Gwangi was a script prepared in 1940 by Willis O'Brien, the SFX technician responsible for King Kong.  His apprentice, Ray Harryhausen, acquired a copy of the script, but when O'Brien's project was aborted,  Harryhausen forgot about it until in 1966, having wrapped up work on One  Million Years B.C., Harryhausen and producer-friend Charles Schneer found  the script in Harryhausen's garage, and decided to film it.  William Bast  was brought it to make changes; originally set in 1940, the story was  pushed back to circa 1900.<br />The film's genesis proved to be most  troubling.  Schneer and Harryhausen's primary distributor, Columbia  Pictures, felt the film would be too expensive (it called for much more in  the way of stop-motion animation and film-splicing FX than previous  Harryhausen projects), but Ken Myler of Seven Arts (which had financed One  Million Years B.C.) liked the project and took it to Warner Brothers when  Seven Arts bought into the film company.<br />Filming took two years and was  plagued with problems.  There were reports of controversies with director  James O'Connelly (Harryhausen wound up directing the majority of the film,  though it was mostly because of the sheer quantity of  stop-motion/splitscreen effects work needed) and also spats between Schneer  and the film's musical composer, Jerome Moross.  There was also the matter  of Israeli actress Gina Golan, cast as the film's heroine, T.J.  Breckenridge; Golan could not speak fluent English, so her voice had to be  dubbed for the entire film.<br />Then, when the film was finished, Ken Myler  left Warner Brothers-Seven Arts, and the new management wanted nothing to  do with the film, so they dumped it on the market with little more than a  poster and a coming attractions trailer as publicity.  The bitter  experience almost drove Harryhausen out of movies.<br />The film could have  been a huge hit, because it is very entertaining, highlighted by Jerome  Moross' thrilling score (Moross used a large orchestra, a luxury becoming  extinct in the budget-crunched movie industry of 1968-9), great  performances by James Franciscus, Richard Carlson, and company, and  animation by Harryhausen that is among his finest.  The allosaur Gwangi is  quite an energetic beast, and his battles with a belligerent styracosaur  and later a circus elephant (this scene has been unfairly criticized  because the elephant is depicted as too large and moving a bit too  smoothly) are thrilling and at times a bit overpowering.  Contributing  mightily to the film's adrenaline rush is awe-inspiring sound editing and  FX; the growling voices of Gwangi and the styracosaur are far deeper and  more menacing than monster voices in previous Harryhausen films; even when  the beasts simply breathe, the menace is unmistakable; the echo effect when  Gwangi prowls through a huge church late in the film is brilliantly  realized.  <br />The human characters are often overlooked in reviews of the  film, for they succeed in holding it all together.  Tuck Kirby (James  Franciscus) and T.J. Breckenridge are sparring over ownership of a  struggling wild west show, but bite of more than they can chew when the  discovery of a tiny horse - a prehistoric Eohippus, tenderly animated by  Harryhausen - leads to The Forbidden Valley.  The human characters are put  through the emotional wringer as they fight, reconcile, fight again, team  up to battle the dinosaurs, and succeed in bringing Gwangi to captivity.   But Tuck has had his fill, and wants no part of T.J's scheme to use Gwangi  as part of the show.  When Gwangi is freed by gypsies, he kills the  elephant (a battle that is quite gory for a G-rated film) and traps Tuck  and T.J. in a church, where he is killed when a flaming brazier sets the  place afire.  The climatic fire rips at the audience as Gwangi wails in its  death throes, and we are left feeling guilty at the creature's death.<br />The  film's extremely unhappy ending is uncharacteristic of a Ray Harryhausen  film, and may be why Harryhausen has admitted that the film is not one of  the favorites he has done.  He should feel more pride in it, though, for it  is a true masterpiece of his.

0684874350|5.0|I finished this book months ago, and it still haunts me.  I plan to be the first in line (on-line?) when the sequel is released this fall. Although  born and raised in this country, I am Irish through and through, and I  responded deeply to the absolute authenticity of McCourt's voice.  After  finishing this book, I felt that I understood my mother's family much  clearly.  Yes, just as you've heard, terrible things happen in  &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;, many of them, but just when you think you can't  take any more, McCourt turns the tables and leaves you laughing and crying  all at once.  In thinking back on this book, I can't help  but quote (sort  of) that other famous Irishman with a fine appreciation for black humor,  Beckett:  &quot;We must go on.... I can't go on...... I will go on!&quot;   <br />Now that's Irish for you.  So quick -- get the book!
0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart is one of Chinua Achebe's finest works.  It takes place in Nigeria and tells about a brave warrior of an african tribe.  His name is Okonkwo.  The tribe is taken over by colonial rule, and has to face the  problems that come with the white men.  The book is very interesting and  the events that happpen to the characters through out the story can be  related to every day life almost every where in the world.  I enjoyed  learning about a culture and way of life that was unfamiliar to me.  The  story is very well written and gives the reader times of suspense, joy and  anger.  It is entertaing to try to predict what actions the characters will  take in reaction to their surroundings.  The setting is very unique and the  time period tells about the hardships of people whose feelings are usually  taken for granite.  The point of view that Achebe tells the story through  makes you think twice about who you are and who your ancestors were.  The  book is great to see what happens when things fall apart and don't go  exactly as planned.  I love the inability to predict future events of the  book.  This adds loads of suspense.  The ending is very unique and  unpredictable.  The main character, Okonkwo deals with things in a  different fashion than most people probably would.

0385474547|4.0|Things Fall apart is a great novel for everyone.  It is about an african tribe taking place in nigeria africa.  The tribe is taken over by colonial rule and the book tells how Okonkwo a brave warrior of the tribe deals with  the problems that come along with the colonial rule.  The problems that the  tribe faces can relate to anyone  no matter where they live or what their  culture and way of life is.  Some people may be attracte3d or unattracted  to the book because of it's setting and basic plot.  Don't be.  the story  gives the reader a lot more thatn just an entertaining story.  It teaches  many lessons for people young old whatever.  Thjings fall apart is a book  for all telling what happen when thing dont go as planned and how society  deals with them.
0440219078|5.0|This speculative novel won the 1994 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. Apparently, it is one of the most popular books for children (approximately ages ten to thirteen) in the late 1990s.  It is about a young boy named Jonas who lives in an unusual future world  and is about to turn twelve. In this world, everyone lives in a highly  structured Community and each is assigned specific roles. There is no war,  no pain, and when one is old and is no longer contributing to the  community, they happily are \\"released,\\" although no one seems to know what  that really means. When a young person turns twelve (all turn ages on the  same date each year; just like horses do today), there is a big ceremony in  which each is assigned their future job at which they become apprenticed.  However, Jonas is not assigned to a job. Due to his special insights,  compassion, and intelligence, he has been selected to be the new Receiver  of Memories. This Receiver is a single individual who has within themselves  all of the memories of the past, including memories of true pain, war,  passion, family, etc. The older Receiver becomes the Giver and begins to  transfer these memories to Jonas. Soon Jonas discovers concepts he never  even considered. For example, he discovers color and that the ability to  perceive color had been purposedly removed in the distant past. He  discovers hills, snow, joy, and pain. And he learns about love. Finally, he  discovers what \\"release\\" really means. And, he and the Giver must do  something about it. Near the end of the novel, Jonas starts a quest to find  others with imagination, memories, and passions; others with more humanity.
0767835107|5.0|Sarah Michelle Gellar(Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, Scream 2) plays Katherine, an evil, manipulative stepsister of Sebastian, played by Ryan Phillipe(I Know What You Did Last Summer) who convinces Sebestian to  deflower her old boyfriend Court's new girlfriend, an innocent, naive  Cecila played by Selma Blair. Sebastian finds a greater challenge in the  pure, faithful Annette, the new school headmaster's daughter played by  Reese Witherspoon(Election, Pleasantville.) This is an exellent movie with  a great plot and superb acting, espeacilly by Sarah Michelle Gellar. The  ending is a different twist to the movie, but it is perfect in everyway and  the best ending to a movie I've ever seen. If you have not seen this movie  yet, go now and buy it when it comes out. You won't regreat it.
0451198670|4.0|I couldn't help but fall in love with the plot of this descriptive, beautifully written love story. -Intriguing older woman, young but not-so-naive man, a store full of literature and bubbling over with sexual  tension.       When young Johnny agrees to stay at his parents' home in the  small, elite New England town of Pequot (no mention of the state) for the  summer to earn some money working at a book store owned by a friend of his  father's, he has no idea what he's gotten himself into.    Helen MacFaquhar  is beautiful. She's not pretty in the conventional supermodel-type of way.  Her beauty is more like an air about her- an intriguing, disturbing,  wrenching beauty. After a failed marriage, Helen was enjoying her single  life, seducing the men of Pequot in droves. In fact, it wasn't always a  sexual lure-it was in the way she spoke, in the way she looked every  individual in the eye and touched them, gently, as she spoke, as she  listened. Even women loved her. She owned Horatio Street Books, and this is  where her affair with young Johnny began.     One morning as Helen looked  through her massive pile of mail, she noticed a love letter so full of  passion she could not stop herself from reading it once, twice, three  hundred times over. It was addressed to &quot;Ram,&quot; written by  &quot;goat.&quot; For weeks this letter plagued her, drove her crazy to  think someone could be in love with her so deeply.       As the novel  progresses, which by the way, is a tad slowly at first, you can sense the  sexual tension between Johnny and Helen. When finally they do &quot;get  together,&quot; their love affair is so gripping and passionate it will  make you long for the same. I found myself just wanting to reach over and  hold the man laying next to me. It really inspires love.            The  ending, which I will not give away, leaves much to be desired. For a novel  of this substance you want an ending that'll make you smile, you want a  fabulous change to occur,you want to know where the affair ends up! But  it's left quite open-endeed, which for me was awfully discouraging.
B0000019HU|5.0|I'f i was to try and pinpoint one recent album that i felt was the prism for what so much of what has followed after, it would be this one.  At least if you find yourself disliking it, you can ignore virtually all of  the American 'Mathrock' (hateful term) that followed. The vocals,  incidentally, are wonderful, abstract elements within these songs.  Only  complaint: i only wish the current bands who obviously adore this album as  much as i do would stop trying to recreate it. IT ISN'T GOING TO  HAPPEN!<br />Click on 'Buy'
0800132009|5.0|I always thought &quot;Dr. Zivago&quot; was the best movie I've ever seen...until now.  This one blew me away.  Outstanding.
B000002KMY|4.0|Forget the comparisons with Ozzy.  Sabbath with Dio is a different band.  And it is awesome.  <br />Mob Rules and Turn Up the Night are high octane gloom and doom.  Ronnie growls through Voodoo and Sign of the Southern  Cross, leaving the listener both energized and a little freaked out.  A  couple weaker tracks at the end (Falling Off the Edge of the World, Over  and Over)  keep this from being a classic, but overall, it is an incredible  experience.
0345350472|4.0|This is a pleasant and amazing book, easy and quick to read, quite original. Do not expect to find Harrison Ford, he is not there. I also liked the psychology of the various characters.
B000002LR6|5.0|It's a dark and forboding place indeed.  This Cd will introduce your ears to the smack down hotel, and your life will never be the same again.  This is the masterpiece of Ministry, every song is amazing.  Just one fix and TV  II might be the best one two punch on any Ministry album.  If you don't own  this album already you owe it to yourself to buy it right now!
B000002J09|5.0|THE ALBUM CONATINS 8 EIGHT GREAT SONGS INCLUDING THE CLASSSIC, STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN. ANY BODY WHO BASHES THIS BAND HAS ROCKS IN THEIR HEAD OR HAVE NO TASTE IN MUSIC! THIS ALBUM IS A MUST FOR ANY BODY WHO IS INTO REAL MUSIC!
B000002UDV|2.0|I bought this CD mainly because of its critical acclaim.  When I first listened to it I was completely shocked at how ordinary it was--the word that comes to mind is CALLOW. Listen to the over-the-top wretchedness of  Mike Love's so-called singing on 'That's Not Me' and you'll understand what  I mean. Brian Wilson's comment in the liner notes that this particular song  was so great that he 'couldn't get enough listens' must mean that he's  actually deaf in BOTH ears when it comes to judging Mr. Love's ability.   There are actually some good songs on this album, however-- 'Sloop John B',  'God Only Knows', and 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' are rightly called classics.   But to compare it in the same breath to 'Sergeant Pepper' is ludicrous.
0062515675|4.0|Sharma uses a fable (involving a garden, a lighthouse and a sumo wrestler-to name a few) to describe the &quot;seven virtues&quot; and easy to use techniques for self improvement.  Everything is readily  understandable and feasible.  Of course, the trick is to implement the  techniques in your own life. :-) Unfortunately...the author can't do that  for you!
6302597544|5.0|THE BEST!!! All the Hits, and an audience of at least 100,000!  From the Monsters Of Rock Concert, an Awesome Video that has almost every hit AC/DC has Had!
B0000024JN|5.0|I really got it for &quot;Fight for your right&quot;. That is a really funny song and for &quot;Ryhmin &amp; Stealin&quot; they make some cool songs.! But dont listen to it unless it is on full blast.. mama just chill  its the BEASTY BOYS!
B00000JCB2|5.0|I have herd it on the radio and I have seen the video. It is the best album. One good thing about it is that it has many guest singers and rappers on it I.E. Eminem and John davis. It is set to blow up big. I have  their last album and it rocked. All of the songs were good on it and I  expect this one to be better. I have no doubt that this one will top the  charts. I think that this C.D. willrock because It has a unique sound to  it.
6304458894|1.0|Caution: This is the WORST movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also I do Believe Natalie Portman is in this movie. I find it extremely weird she was in the best movie ever (Star Wars Episode 1) and also in the worst movie ever  (Mars Attacks!). Sounds like something from a Nancy Drew book. Another  reason is the special fx suck! The skelotens grossed me out! Mars attacks  was not just cheezy, stupid, and nothing happens, it was also very  disturbing. DO NOT buy Mars Attacks (if you worry about spending your money  on something good)!
B00000J7RZ|5.0|I HEARD THE ALBUM BEING REVIEWED OVER THE RADIO THE OTHER DAY AS SHE WAS BEING INTERVIEWED ABOUT HER NEW ALBUM COMMING OUT SOON, AND I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE SONGS AND CAN'T WAIT TILL THE ALBUM COMES OUT TUESDAY, I  WILL DEFINTELY GET IT., JENNIFER IS A GREAT ARTIST AND I WISH HER ALOT OF  SUCCESS, :)  A GREAT LATINA.
B00000JCB3|5.0|I heard some of the tracks. This album is darker and smarter lyrics. You can tell Fred has been working on his voice.
B00000IQMT|5.0|I never was a die-hard Star Wars fan. But I was excited when they released Episode 1. I haven't seen the movie yet,but ever since I bought this soundtrack,I've thought of John Williams in a whole new way. This Star Wars  soundtrack is better than the first three all put together. The CD booklet  has a very special feature: It is a Star Wars Episode 1 fold-out movie  poster! This poster has most of the characters,such as Queen Amidala,Anakin  Skywalker,Darth Maul,Qui-Gon Ginn,and Obi-Wan Kenobi. This music is the  best i've heard any orchestra do. If you like Star Wars,or really good  music,you must buy this CD!
0783114222|5.0|I grew up in the 60's and followed the space program in class and on the news.  This series brought back great memories.  Tom Hanks did a great job of bringing the story of APOLLO to those that weren't there to experience  it.
6303022901|3.0|The cinematography was gorgeous in this movie, but the writing left something to be desired.  The dialogue was unrealistic and preachy.  It enforces stereotypes about Asian men, but the women don't fare much better.   Waverly is a brittle, self-absorbed yuppie.  Even more apalling was that a  mother's drowning her baby was glibly excused because she had a nasty  husband.  Although I think that women should reclaim their connection to  their mothers and to nature, the script needed a few rewrites.  And Russel  Wong can rough house with me any time.
0393314804|5.0|Welsh's &quot;Trainspotting&quot; is a wild ride through the minds and lives of this group of Scottish junkies. This is a novel that will transcend time and become one of the most popular cult books ever. It is as  vivid in description as it is in Scottish-drowned humor. The Scottish  dialect only adds to the remarkable essence of the book. Soon, the reader  will be speaking as one of the characters. The movie, though terrific in  its own right, hardly does the novel justice. The reader is forced to look  at the problems and lifestyle of Mark Renton, Sick Boy and the others. It's  as close as one will ever get to being strung out on smack and living in a  pit of desperate measures for their next hit without having to actually  shoot up.
6302814782|5.0|There are loads of reviews here, but what the heck, here's another! This movie rooooooooooooooooooooocks!! It's hysterical yet scary, and is just so cool! You can tell it's an '80's movie with all the music, but still, it  rooocks!   I urge you to buy this if you are thinking about it!!! Take it  from me, it's awesome!
6305078564|5.0|All characters in this movie meshed with each other.  You'll want to watch it so much your husband has to tell you to turn it off!
1558908366|5.0|this is an excellent transfer to dvd of a great romance movie. there is no snow or digital messiness. the scenes are crystal clear, the soundtrack transfer is superb, this was a great job of transfering.  this is a must  have for your dvd collection.
0930289528|5.0|This one's a classic, no doubt about it. An exceptionally well-presented anti-totalitarian theme couched in an entertaining narrative. The Wachowski brothers of THE MATRIX fame want to make this their next non-Matrix film...  I just can't wait. Any fan of graphic storytelling HAS to read this, and  anyone who's scoffed at the medium previously should give it a try and be  bowled over. Superior work, and better than most of what I've read in prose  lately.
1559408898|2.0|this is a terrible transfer to dvd of a great movie,  there is so much snow and digital messiness and the soundtrack is even lousy. do yourself a favor and buy the regular dvd version  of robocop as it boasts an excellent  picture and soundtrack. stay away from this version. it has less than 60  seconds of additional footage which by todays standards are nothing really  gory. the quality of the transfer is pathetic.
078322706X|3.0|this wasn't a bad film, but i have seen better.  Brad Pitt did an outstanding job as Death, but Hopkins faltered a bit and fell into a bit of a cliched role...didn't really seem to gain any depth as a character until  the end.  the director gave us a pat ending that doesn't sit well after the  previous three hours.  the relationship between the father and daughters is  also a little too cliche and lacking of depth, and the supporting  characters (board members) were too predictable. well-intentioned film that  fell short.
6305252521|5.0|The Trueman Show displays a great storyline, unlive any seen before, and some of the most amazing acting ever seen. It has to be the clost thing to a perfect film, the actors  really get into their characters.
0440539811|5.0|The magic of this mental roller-coaster rests in the way it will explain how &amp; why everything is, then in the next chapter it will explain how and why the previous explaination was a lie spread as disinformation.  By  the last chapter, you're ready to believe that Leviathan really would want  to wed a yellow submarine!  This is a great primer for understanding  Principia Discordia's dissolution and reconstruction of truth.
0060171936|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was fun to read as well as informative.  I don't understand why people are so angry and hateful about such simple concepts as love, truth, and beauty.  Perhaps they aren't any of those things.  True  or not this book is a great read.  Native peoples have and always will be  exploited by others.  It's too bad the &quot;others&quot; don't respect all  that life encompasses.  It will be their downfall.
B000006NPY|2.0|Not even a quarter of this album is decent. The lyrics are sappy and poor, as is the music. The only songs that stick out are &quot;The Tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete&quot; and &quot;To Shiela&quot; - but especially  &quot;Appels + Oranjes.&quot; Other than that, this album sucks and is  close to utter trash. <br />AVOID.
B00000GJ2B|5.0|Quite possibly. Robert De Niro gives the greatest single performance I've ever seen. People use the word &quot;gritty&quot; too much but that's what this is. It is a powerful movie but at the same time subtle and charming.  The cinematography is absolutely brilliant (boxing scenes) and the dialogue  is pitch-perfect. I'd love to see Joe Pesci and De Niro in a Shakespeare  film. Why? I don't friggin know.
B000003TSP|5.0|Whoever said that this was not as good as we were saying it was is wrong. This album is fantastic. It is different than Dummy, but is just as good - of not better. This album leads more towards the alternative genre, but  Dummy leads more into the r&amp;b/trip-hop genre. <br />I love it. Anyone who  gives it less than four stars should be banned from Amazon.com!!!!!
B000001ED1|5.0|Dare to call this a CD. She must of sold her soul to the devil to produce blues like this ...This is truly a piece anyone, anywhere can appreciate. If you don't enjoy this one, you truly need your pulse checked !
6300214826|5.0|This movie is well done and is true in spirit to Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot;  That is, it shows the evil that can overcome men's souls. If you like Captain Willard's narration, written by  Michael Herr, read Herr's book &quot;Dispatches.&quot;  The book is almost  written in the same fashion. Stewart O'Nan writes, &quot; 'Apocalypse Now'  continues to mesmerize viewers not because of what is says but how it says  it.&quot;  This is true to a point. However, I think most audiences will  grasp the larger message.
B000000H64|5.0|If you want a CD that will really kick some ass and take down the names, you want Demanufacture.  Should definitely be a fan of super fast guitars and in your face vocals.
B000002HPV|5.0|Homogenic is one of those albums that is essential for any music collection. If not for the great songs, then for the unusual structure of music Bjork creates. Just listen to the sound effects backed by classical  strings and you know that this album is ahead of its time!
B000002L9J|5.0|Awesome.  10 years later the music still sounds fresh.  A must have
6305313687|5.0|A couple of days after seeing AHX, I got a letter from a friend to whom I had recommended the film and who lives in Venice Beach. His home had been vandalized by a black gang. He was being punished for the crime of being  white. And he said in the letter that this action was &quot;shades of  AHX.&quot;  I agree with the viewer who said the film should be shown in  high school. Maybe, just maybe, it could do some good, could stop some of  the violence and hatred before it is too late. Yes, Norton should have  gotten the Academy Award; his performance was over the top. And the film is  a very important one which deals with a terrible reality which must be  addressed because it is tearing at the very fabric of American society. I  could go on and on about the film, but my advice is to buy it and watch it  and tell your friends about it. It is one of the most important statements  ever made on film.
B000002HMH|5.0|*shakes her head sadly* I don't have a prefrence when it come to Metallica, old or new it doesn't really matter but I think some of you need to look at what you're saying. When someone goes on about how great one of  metallica's songs are notice it's almost always their softer and slower  songs. The Unforgiven has beem linked with the word &quot;epic&quot; and a  lot of people on here talk about how good songs like One and Fade to Black  are. So you think that the slower songs are better yet when they come out  with a slower album (that still has great songs) everyone starts to b****.  I think that Until it Sleeps is a great song and I think (and I know I'm  not alone in thinking this) that most of Metallica's best work has been  done in their slower songs.   They have been playing for 16 years (or  something like that) and after the first eight years they deciced to change  their music a little. You can only play the same stuff for so long before  it begins to sound old and people begin to think your in a rut.   I was  checking out some other reviews on another heavy rock group and some people  were saying how had metallica taken a different path this is where they  could have been. What I don't think a lot of people fully realize is that  Metallica was great from the begining, at the begining they were where the  other bands are now after years of hard work. Metallica wanted a little  change and if you're going to hold that against them then I don't think you  deserve to call yourself a Metallica fan.   Everyone changes, you, me, the  old lady you pass on your way to school every morning. Why is it that  Metallica has to sit where change is not allowed?
6302732778|5.0|Blade Runner, based on the Novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot; by Phillip K Dick, is an insightful tale for those of us who have ever felt that the marvellous creation we call life is over far too  soon.<br />The story involves a certain Rick Deckard, played innocently by  Harrison Ford who manages to fit in perfectly in tune with the Noirish  theme of the movie. <br />He has been assigned to &quot;retire&quot; dangerous  Nexus 6 replicants, Off-world colonists who are seeking to increase their 4  year life span. Rutger Hauer is magnificent as Roy Batty, leader of this  group. <br />There is also Daryl Hannah, who portrays Pris. Quite what made  Ridley Scott decide to choose her must have been a mystery to WB, but she  remains the gem in this movie, neither outdoing nor detracting from the  main characters.<br />Blade Runner remains my favourite movie of all time,  however, I am a stalwart and the original still seems slightly better...  Nevertheless, I feel that once you have seen the movie, you will want both  versions.<br />A monumental movie, and as such, deserves never to slip into  obscurity, for it is the greatest Film Noir of all time.
B000002BSG|2.0|After seeing a Jamiroquai performance on tv I was convinced I would love this cd.  That didn't turn out to be the case...the vast majority of this disc is jumbled nonsense and the only two songs that are at all redeemable  are &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot; and &quot;Alright&quot;.  Don't waste your  money...
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's recording spanned 129 days - and as the album sleeve says, &quot;Probably the most creative 129 days in rock music history.&quot;  The album sleeve didn't lie.  EVERY SINGLE SONG on the album is both original  and very creative.  One such example is one of John Lennon's best songs,  &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.&quot;  The vivid mind-pictures and  imagery in Lucy make her, and her album both a masterpiece.  A must for  every Beatles music collection.
B000002KNI|5.0|This album is one of the best cd's I have ever bought.  It is 100% &quot;LIVE&quot; as evident in the song &quot;The Boxer&quot; when Paul Simon makes a mistake and starts to early.  This has all the songs you  could want on it and more.  I am very picky when it comes to music albums,  and this one is my favorite.  If you are looking to get interested in Simon  &amp; Garfunkel, this is the way to do it.  The audience is great and so is  the band!  BUY THIS, and ENJOY IT!!!!!
6305358567|5.0|A wonderful movie for fans of Queen Elizabeth I. Cate Blanchett gives an extraordinary performance as the young Queen and Joseph Fiennes is admirable as Robert Dudley.  Vivid in its depiction of the cruelty faced by  Protestants under Queen Mary.  Christopher Eccleston is wonderful as the  arrogant Duke of Norfolk; he was an actor I'd never seen before.  His  performance alone is worth the two hour running time of this film.  I've  only had it a week and have watched it three times already!!
6305268835|5.0|This movie was a really excellent movie and I think anyone between the ages of 8 and 13 would love this movie.  It's very funny!  (I'm 8).
B000002NJS|5.0|This is without a doubt Madonna's crowning achievement.  The only gripe I had was with the song &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot; which comes off as pretensious rather than enlightening.  But when every other song on the cd  is terrific, it is easily something I can overlook.  Madonna seems to be  doing her best Bjork imitation with this cd and while she doesn't succeed  in out doing her (which would be virtually impossible) this is a welcomed  change for Madonna none the less.  If you want two cds that contain the  best Madonna has to offer, &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; and the slighly  inferior &quot;Erotica&quot; are your best choices.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is, alongside Sgt. Pepper, one of the greatest Beatles albums ever.  Not only does it contain the rock style of songs such as &quot;She's So Heavy,&quot; this album also contains up-beat and optimistic songs, such  as &quot;Here Comes the Sun.&quot;  For the avid Beatles fan, this album is  a must-have.  It's a masterpice, nothing short of a masterpiece.
1573301051|5.0|A once in a lifetime line up of five of the most successful divas in the music industry... simply irresistible... you've got to see it...
B000000WCX|5.0|After wasting his time with so many old songs and covers ('tonight') and marrying supermodels and experimenting with tin machine and other forgetful projects, Bowie is finally back with this one.  In my opinion the first one  worth buying since &quot;Let's Dance&quot;.  Other Bowie fans may disagree  because they prefer his older, deeper 70's stuff (as I do) but you have to  remember this man does not have musical integrity he does what he likes at  the time...and I like this one! My favorites are Dead Man Walking and 7  Years in Tibet.  Overall great CD from Bowie.  Hey wasn't this album  nominated for a Grammy award in '98?
B00000DFRS|3.0|I dislike the vast majority of Whitney Houston's music as much as the next guy, but this cd actually has some decent songs.  &quot;It's Not Right...&quot;, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, and &quot;If I Told You  That&quot; are a welcomed change for Whitney.  While I can't recommend  buying this cd (there are more bad songs then good songs on this disc) I  will say this much...if you ABSOLUTELY must own one of her cds this is the  only one worth your time.
B000002H97|4.0|Good album but it lacks the flash of all the previous albums.  I think it's because of Bob Rock.  I like James' vocals but I think Kirk Hammet forgot how to play the guitar in this one.
B0000009SG|5.0|I think this was the last album where Zappa used Marshalls in the studio. The guitar sound is very warm (valve microphones?) and the arrangement guitar/brass is outstanding. I bought my first Over-Nite Sensation in 1974  and have consumed 3 vinyls and 4 CDs during the 25 years. Buy it!
B00000F1D3|4.0|I hated myself for buying it, but I hated myself even more for liking it.  Finally I came to the conclusion that I could forgive myself just this once for giving into such a cheesy cd.  The songs are catchy to the max (with  the exception of &quot;Love Is The Groove&quot;) and the revamped version  of &quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot; simply rocks.  Half of the album is a  blatant rip-off of Madonna's far superior &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; cd while  the rest of it is pure disco madness.  If you can get over that, I think  you'll have a good time...
6301972015|5.0|I never tire of watching this film. I pick up something new every time I view it, whether it's a funny line, or a certain telling look from Tracy to one of her paramours. Couldn't have a dreamier cast of actors-who couldn't  fall in love with either Jimmy or Cary??? Of course every girl in the world  would love to look like Katherine Hepburn, especially in those fabulous  clothes, or have her wit. I'm positive once you see this film it will rank  as one of your favorites for the rest of your movie viewing years!
0380973464|3.0|Cryptonomicon is a great book that will appeal to half the population of the US. Men are smart. Men are changing the world. But - where are the women? I can understand that in WW2, a novelist would need to concentrate  on the masculine agenda to get some action, but why in the near-now  world?<br />The story line is fun, fast. Changing from WW2 to present is  intriguing, leaving the reader to assimulate generational interrelations.  But, still, I found the relatios between the male/female characters in the  near-now world lacking.<br />Men, especially &quot;nerdy&quot; men, will  completely enjoy this book. Women, some nerdy women, will like it, too.  Most women and many non-&quot;nerdy&quot; men will see a huge lack in the  character development, especially for the female characters.<br />Personally,  I liked the Avi character. If I had met someone like theat in my (somewhat  limited) career, I could have worked for him (or her) forever. I wish there  were more Avi-like people around, smart enough to make a difference and  interested more in making things right than in making money.<br />Still, even  though I liked the book, I would have to give it a 3/5, since it will not  reach a large (book reading!) part of the population. Neal, if you're  reading this, develop your female characters, and the relations with the  males more, and you'll sell even better. &quot;Snow Crash&quot; was better  along these lines, although the story for this one was better in many other  ways.<br />Keep writing.<br />Phil
0446605409|5.0|Nelson DeMille gests back to his best a mixture of romance suspence and humour. I could not put this books down. Not since Generals Duaghter and the Charm School have I enjoyed a book so much. I can't wait for more. I  just wish Nelson could write faster so we would have to wait so long!
0375707972|2.0|This book has a very important message and is extremely well written. I loved the author's style which is simple and not overly wordy. However, I did not like a single character that I met in this book. Perhaps that was  intentional. The whole time I was reading it I had to ask myself why I  didn't just put it down. It's a book that must be finished. It is  important. It's just not entertaining.
0899668380|5.0|I love this book.  Forget all versions of the films, including the upcoming one,  this blows all of them out of the water.  From beginning to end, Matheson hooks us into Nevilles world and we can't put the book down  afterwords.  The ending is still my favorite of all horror books.
B000002KN8|3.0|Depeche Mode's first LP is much more upbeat and dance-oriented than their later, post-Clarke work. While most of the songs here are very enjoyable, there is one major disappointment. This CD lacks the shorter single version  of its best-known song, &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot;, instead offering  only an annoying extended mix.
0800177177|2.0|Like many people have already said, the movie has little or nothing to do with Bram Stoker's novel. I saw the movie a couple weeks ago and, not having read the novel, I thought it was great. The scenes were perfect, the  costumes were great, and so was the cast (with the exception of Keanu  Reeves, everytime I saw him I erased him from the screen). Having seen it I  bought the book and read it. It is amazing how this movie and the book it  comes out of can be so different. One might even think that Coppola is just  ripping everybody off by giving the title &quot;Bram Stoker's  Dracula&quot;. Bram must be rolling in his grave.  To begin with, Dracula  is supposed to be ruthless, unloving, a monster, a senseless beast; while  in the movie he behaves as if he had problems of the heart, making him look  like an emotional doof. Coppola was trying to say that even the lord of  darkness has a heart. Bram never intended that to happen! Dracula is the  enemy of humanity, he has no heart! Second, Bram's Renfield is an important  element to the story. His quest to acquire life does not make him an  absolute lunatic, he looks more like an eccentric intellectual. Coppola's  Renfield is just a damn sorry loony with no vital role in the movie.   Third, now that I think about it, I didn't really know what was going on in  the movie. Places and events were so mixed up that one just sits and  admires the special effects and scenery. For those who haven't read the  novel, Coppola throws an endless bunch of intermixed scenes which would  make sense to one who's read it, but which are badly done and totally cut.   Basically this movie, though it has some awesome scenes, is a rip-off. I  haven't yet seen other significant Dracula movies, but this is definitely  one which is like any cheap Hollywood rendering of good novels. It's a lot  of flash and hype, but there's little benath it.  Read the novel, it  contains much more action and suspense than the movie and it's a lot  clearer than the movie will ever be.

6304143184|5.0|This is also my all time favourite movie. I also saw this when I was very young. I barely remember the details, but refreshed my memory when I watched it again in grade 5. That was a long time ago too. Now that I'm 20,  I wish to own a copy of this movie. There are a few reasons why I love this  movie: 1) Old movies from 80's portray aliens as friendly beings, whereas  now they are all X-File killer things 2) The music is none other than John  William's 3) Brings back childhood memories 4) Very touching story, all in  the style of the 80's...too bad we don't get stories like that anymore
B000009VOL|2.0|I bought this record after it appeared on numerous &quot;best of&quot; lists for 1998 but I'm less than impressed.  The mood is there but the song writing is weak.  &quot;Metal Heart&quot; is the exception and hints at  great things to come if she concentrates more on the tunes.
B000002G6J|5.0|I first became attracted to Jobim after purchasing a copy of the vinly &quot;WAVE&quot; a good many years ago. The music today is as romantic and fresh as it was when I first heard it played.  The music seems to me to  give a look into the mans heart and soul
6304147589|5.0|I'm reading all the mixed reviews on Michael Cimino's &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; and one thing comes to mind...have we all seen the same film!  Granted, this is not &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, but why do I keep coming  back to watch this film?  The sheer scale of this film makes it worth  watching, as well as the cinematography and performances.  It took a lot of  guts to make such a downbeat story in such loving detail.  I hate to say  this, but this is another one of those films that are hated upon release  and claimed as a masterpiece in 30 years by critics and the public alike.   I love this film for all the reasons everyone hates it so!  Give this film  a chance and you will come away enchanted.
B000002NFM|5.0|These guys put the punk that was missing in techno and the techno that was missing in punk. They are the new Sex Pistols.
B000005RFL|5.0|In a world of heavy metal imitators, no one does it better than Sabbath.  Sure they had their peers (but Deep Purple was never really metal, and Zeppelin were kind of overrated), and they had their heirs (Priest and  Maiden, and perhaps early Metallica).  But to this day Black Sabbath define  metal,and Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath is the finest album by the original four.   It has just the right blend of electric and acoustic guitars, a variety of  tempos, and lyrics that mix magic with the basest of real-life  existentialism.  Kudos also to Drew Struzan, who created a cover which  flirted with Satanism but actually invokes the duality of man.  Now, I was  only 2 when it was first released, but I can only guess that this album  captures exactly what it was like to be a teen in 1973.  How I wish I could  have seen Sabbath, Purple, or Elf in their '70s heyday.  And frankly,  &quot;Fluff&quot; is so wonderful I wish I could have had it played at my  wedding.
0790731452|2.0|Unenthusiastic performances by Nicholson and all others involved, it must have just been a way pick up a few easy bucks for them.<br />Not intended to be, but still ugly monsters, over used in this so called parody of sci fi  films.<br />Bad editing, awful screen play, bad acting, etc.<br />Forget this  one.
630242335X|5.0|After the stagnant visuals of The Final Frontier, this was a feast for the eyes. The Undiscovered Country is without a doubt, a close second to The Wrath of Khan. From the dedication to Gene Roddenberry at the beginning to  the Paramount logo at the end, it was a masterpiece. The story was very  good- nearly flawless, and holds together well. The production design  reached its peak on this film- from the tasteful silver, red and blue decor  on the Excelsior to the grim icebound caves of a space prison. There could  not have been a better farewell to the crew of the Enterprise. Music here  was spot on, the main title being very impressive. The Undiscovered Country  was the fourth Star Trek film I ever watched, but it is safe to say that  this is the movie that got me hooked, and made me want to go back and  re-view 2, 3 and 4.
B0000024IE|5.0|Well... yes!  I'm not exagerrating!! This album is sheer visionary BRILLIANCE.  Never before or since has any single album like this been possible -- nothing this brutal or focused has ever come out of rap or PE  again... This is hard to describe in words.  This album is a masterpiece --  it hammers its point home with amazing beats and super-, super-,  super-eloquent raps the likes of which have never been heard before or  since.
6301543408|2.0|After a non stop blast of action and adventure, both story-wise and visually in Trek 2,3 and 4, this film seemed almost insulting. The Story was okay, but had very bad inconsistencies in relation to the history of  Star Trek. Shatner directed the movie competently, and there are a few  scenes that are very well put together, but generally, it was washed out  and had no conviction. Only Scotty was interesting- his waistcoat with  toolbelt was a nice idea, and when he was not on screen, the film teeters  to an almost crashing bore. Plot details were notr well thought out. How in  the name of hell can the Enterprise have seventy odd decks? Most Trek lore  holds that it has 23. And how could they get to the centre of the galaxy in  just a few hours? Voyager tells us that it would take thirty years to  travel that far. And hasn't the Enterprise herself already crossed the  Great Barrier. These mistakes are the major reason that film does not even  exist in my collection. Plotwise, The Undiscovered Country fits better onto  the End of The Voyage Home. As for FX, Frontier's effort is even less  convincing that The Original Series! At least the music was good, and this  alone gets the film two stars.
0784011796|5.0|A pure masterpiece.  A literal work of art. Great titles also recommend: Cube, Gummo, Basquiat.
6300213803|5.0|I first saw this movie only a long time after seeing numbers 3 through to 6, but it instantly became my favorite. I was fortunate to have seen this film along with the rest of them at a sci-fi film festival held at my local  cinema. This film is highly polished, and has all the best things about  eighties styling in it. (Except that Khan's look has dated somewhat, and  his hairsyle seems to have been borrowed intact from Tina Turner in Mad Max  Beyond Thunderdome). The visual effects were high quality, and the nebula  scenes still seem better than anything computers can do. (Insurrection  comes close). The Enterprise was vastly improved from The Motion Picture-  and the darkened, more detailed sets fit in nicely with the (then) new  Starfleet Uniforms. Shatner was more in character as Kirk in The Wrath of  Khan, and a nice new dimension to his character is that he must learn to  face age, and death. Khan is still the best villian in a Trek production,  and the fact that he is more obsessed with revenge than evil makes him more  realistic. The old series fanfare at the beginning of the awe inspiring  title theme tells those who see the film that it is something special. It  may have aged styling wise, but the story, so far, has not been beaten.
B00000IL1K|5.0|I've never experienced Sarah other than 'All I Ask of You' from the Phantom.  Where have I been hiding all this time! Eden is absolutely wonderful, peaceful, relaxing, and to say the least, mesmerizing. Now that  I've awaken to the beauty of Sarah..I'll be adding new CD's to my  collection.
6302529867|4.0|To the guy who thought the characters and the story were bland.  Yes, the story has been done elsewhere.  Nonetheless, I fail to see how anyone could remain unmoved by this story.  I've known people like these characters.   And the location footage is incredibly awesome!
6301007875|4.0|I saw this a few years ago, and thought it was good. It was too violent in some scenes, but then that is what you'd expect from Arnold himself. He is a gifted actor. The storyline is one I have never seen duplicated since  then either. This is a video I would watch if there was ABSOLUTELY nothing  else on. :)

6303011012|5.0|I have had this Video for over 2 years now. Every time I watch it, hear it, No matter where I am, Im moved, on all levels. This is TRULY one of the All time greatest. I have never heard anything that comes even remotely  close.

0446604844|5.0|This book keeps you guessing the whole way through without ever giving a clue to the outcome.  The characters appear real and the real life situations are something you hope to never experience.  Pardon the cliche,  it's spellbinding and I could hardly put it down.

B00000IFWE|5.0|I read many of the &quot;Echo&quot; reviews that naysayers were labeling as Petty's &quot;downfall.&quot; So it was with trepidation that I purchased the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers &quot;Echo&quot; album. I  shouldn't have worried -- Petty and the Heartbreakers deliver the  distinctive tunes that we've grown to love with a few surprises thrown in.  Hey, the first time I heard &quot;Full Moon Fever,&quot; I wasn't crazy  about it -- now, it's my favorite album (that seems to have found a  permanent place in the CD player). Hey, give Echo a listen...
B00000IPAX|5.0|Alright i agree that blink is getting to be pop punk but it is totally cool. I am glad for them, i mean these guys are really cool. And it is not like they are main stream, you can still see them at small clubs and still  get all the energy out of a punk concert. True these guys aren't the Clash,  but they are pretty damn close.
0783232039|1.0|I am sorry to say, but this is the one film that I own on DVD that would be better served as a coaster. It is the worst afternoons viewing that it has ever been my painful displeasure to watch, and having teeth pulled  would have been a welcome release. My brother who has a much higher  tolerence to cack films agrees with me. (HE likes Dawsons creak, enough  said). Please pull from your shelves at once, and recycle all your copies  and sell them as coasters.
B00000IQMT|5.0|this cd is awesome! jed-heads and non-jed-heads alike should love it! jed-heads love it especially, i know first hand. i'm proud to be a jed-head! jed-heads all over the world, unite!
B000005JXG|5.0|I bought this CD many years ago after seeing the Pogues on Sat night live. In the span of the Pogues recording career, something magical happened on this one. Perhaps it was Steve Lillywhite's genious, or just the right time  for the band. If I were stranded on a deserted island with only 5 cd's to  hear for the rest of my life, this would be one. I've heard it a million  times and it's still stands the test of time. So many great songs with so  much to say- if you haven't heard the Pogues or Shane MacGowan yet- start  here. If you buy this one, you'll have the whole Pogues/Shane collection  within a year. I've been hooked for 8 wonderful years and damn, it's really  great to be Irish! Raise a pint of the black stuff and prepare to be  reborn!
6300214826|1.0|This movie is too slow paced, and has basically no charater development; might as well see it, so you  know what kind of trash people praise.
079073804X|5.0|This classic is the main reason i bought my player. If your a fan of horror movies then you HAVE to get this flick! Besides being scarier than hell it has some scenes that were deleted from the original. Including an  awesome scene of Linda Blair doing a &quot;spider walk&quot; down the  stairs. The quality &amp; sound is amazing. The &quot;extra features&quot;  are cool! It's not for the weak at heart but if you like to be scared, this  movie delivers!
B00000IL1K|4.0|Sarah Brightman does what Sarah Brightman does best - - - she sings like an angel.  Her voice is a fine tuned instrument that has an &quot;other worldly&quot; quality to it.  I particularly enjoy her rendition of the  Kansas hit &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;, her own version of the megahit  theme song from Titanic &quot;Il Mio Cuore Va&quot; and the final track in  which she pairs up with Richard Marx singing &quot;The Last Words You  Said&quot;
B000005JA8|5.0|Not everyone will get it.<br />It's not 'music', it's not 'rhyme' if you are looking for entertainment, look else where. <br />If you demand intelligent, creative aesthetic, you need look no further. Few artists have located the  center of the soul and fused it so successfully with the intellect. A  brilliant combination of blues, Stockhausen. I first got blown away by  Beefhart 30 years ago. I've grown musically, since then, specifically  getting into microtonal music. It blows my mind how on target he was even  then in this obscure area of music. This one is for the ages.  Unbeliveable!<br />Unfortunatley my favorite: 'Lick My Decals Off Baby&quot;  is out of print.<br />Obviously a big influence on Beck and Waits.
6305120706|5.0|Cats its a great musical and this DVD version has the greatest performers.  I believe this production to achieve a great balance between lyrical singing and modern singing, from Mrs. Page's great interpretation to the  pure vocie of Miss Veerle Casteleyn (Jemima), which charmed me the first  time I saw the play.  I see this video at list once every day, and I dont  get tired of it.  As Jo Gibb says at making of cats featurette, this is the  final version of this musical (produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber himself).  I  only wish the Phantom of the Opera came out in the same format and with  such magnificent production.
6304458894|5.0|This is our favorite alien invasion movie. My 5 year old loves it as does my 34 year old wife. The story centers around invading martians who are violent and try to destroy the earth. This movie will have you in stitches,  laughing at almost every scene and you will watch it over and over many  times. I would highly recommend it to all ages.
B00000F1D3|4.0|I was always aware of Cher's existance (With her clothes, who isn't?), but I wasn't &quot;officially&quot; introduced until a few of her songs were featured in an X-Files episode. It made an immidiate fan out of me and I  eagerly awaited the release of her new album &quot;Believe&quot;.  I also  LOVE to dance and I was not let down when I purchased the album. Cher's  unique voice combined with a good quick beat in most of the songs makes  this album great fun to listen to. At the least it should make you tap your  feet.
B000002UDV|5.0|It's easy to forget that there was a time when the Beach Boys were not only relevant to popular music, but actually revolutionary. &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; not only impresses the listener with its technical  beauty--perfectly blended harmonies laid over intricate musical  constructions--but with the emotional maturity of the songs themselves.  They weren't singing about surfing and drag racing anymore. They were  singing about love, faith, growth and lonliness. &quot;Wouldn't It Be  Nice&quot; deals with such mature concepts as sleeping together and wishing  for an ideal world that'll never exist, and &quot;God Only Knows&quot; is  one of the most beautiful pop songs ever written. &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;  inspired the Beatles to make &quot;Sgt. Pepper.&quot; Any questions?
0897500482|5.0|Noone doubts that Mr. Lee was a master of the fighting arts... His philosophy of getting rid of that which is useless and adding that which will improve an art is seen documented in this book. the overall message of  the book is that you should find what works for you and continually adjust  your style to enhance your fighting ability. it should ne noted that  Bruce's original style was Wing Chun. this book is an incomplete work. the  reader has to piece together the ideas in the book which are in a random  hodge podge fashion. If you are a serious martial artist I recommend this  book very strongly to help spark the more well rounded martial artist in  you. :)
0451169514|5.0|I just started to read Stephan Kings books so I didn't get to this one yet but I saw the movie and  I get very interested in his books. I haven't even read a whole one yet but I'm almost finished DESPERATION. IT will probably  be the next one I read. I also like his books because they are adult  reading and I can understand them well because he holds your interest and  I'm only 12. I also plan to read ALL of his books.
0767903811|5.0|Having read this book under it's English title, I'm actually surprised that Bill Bryson was able to get it published in the US.  Some of it is not very complimentary to his fellow country-men.  My husband and I moved to  the US from Australia in 1997, and our voyage of discovery so closely  mirrored that of Bryon's (both in timing and content) that I often felt the  urge to write to him and compare notes. We have enjoyed Bryson's writing  for years and this is probably his funniest book and the closest to home.   I'd seriously recommend this book to anyone who is moving to the US from  England or Australia; it should be issued along with each expats visa as an  essential part of the cultural cross-over.  He helped to explain some of  the otherwise incomprehensible customs; plus I can't visit the supermarket  without remembering his adventures with breakfast pizzas.  Please Bill  write more.
0380002930|5.0|I really enjoyed &quot;Watershp Down&quot;. What never ceases to fascinate me is the aspect of reality. The actions of the rabbits are so real, you sometimes forget that this book is fiction. I could almost visualize  everything that happened. A total thumbs up.
0393038912|5.0|I'm glad I read the book before I read the reviews.<br />JD developes his assumptions and hypotheses in the in the manner of  a scientist.  He introduces his ideas and than brings out the material to support  them.<br />The result is a new view of how the Europeans came  to dominate the  planet.<br />I don't think his intention was to demonstrate the superiority of  a &quot;racial&quot; group.  <br />I approached this book with hightened  expectation, having read his &quot;The Arrow of Disease&quot; in Discover  Magazine.<br />I liked this book because JD took things we all knew about, and  looked  at their importance in a different way, and presented it in a  cogent and interesting manner.<br />If he desired to engender discussion and  debate, he was successful.<br />I saw the Eurasian success from a new  perspective.  Although I never considered that we are where we are today as  a gift from God, I must admit to having absorbed the ideas of my culture.   JD showed that things, even using earlier information, might be different -  and why it might be so.<br />The author was not didactic.  Ideas were not  rigid.  He did not set out to explain why English succeeded, and the  Ottoman Turks did not (or did they - for a while).<br />He did not set out to  - once again - tell us some of us are smart (intelligent) and some of us  are dumb (not intelligent, or not AS intelligent as . . . WHO?).<br />This  book was another view of how things got to be the way they are.<br />In the  book, It's a Wonderful Life, by Stephen Jay Gould,  Gould makes a point  about evolution and Homo sapien (that's us, folks).  Its a crap shoot.   Roll the dice again, and Homo sapien might not even show up at the  table.<br />Yep, not a plan, not Manifest Destiny, not the White Man's Burden,  not God's Will - just a lot of luck, and as one wag pointed out, Location,  location, location.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who's reasonably  intelligent, and enjoys the challenge of new ideas.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Anyone who doesn't like this movie must never have held a retail job.  However, for those of us who HAVE suffered through retail work (six years for me), this movie highlights everything that is wrong with the world, and  shows why some people just deserve to be killed.  Especially that &quot;How  much IS this thing, ANYway?&quot; girl.
0783228317|5.0|By far this was one of the greatest movies I have ever had the pleasure to read, it is an intense rollercoaster of drug filled missadvenures, in a town where excess is expected and to some extent inored. five stars is  definitly not enough.
B000002KXO|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums &amp; &quot;Straight Back&quot; is my favorite song off this one! First of all even the picture on the cover of this album gets my attention &amp; the songs are excellent. A must have for  any person who likes Fleetwood Mac. It's a diverse &amp; powerful album.
B000006OAM|5.0|I love this cd.   It totally captures the feeling of the eighties generation as we have grown up.  Full of sadness, yet full of hope for a better a world, a world like our parents.  Natalie is about my age and I  can relate to all she sings about.  I have been a big fan of her music for  over ten years.  Her voice is and always has been spectacular.  her vocie  is refined, a pleasure to listen to.  Its a great cd!!!!
6305232660|5.0|Deep impact really hits it with me, while there are not a lot of famous actors and actresses, it still is a very good film. So far, in my many years of movie viewing, I have not seen a better film. I don't have the DVD  yet, but I plan on buying it very soon to add to my quality collection. If  you're looking for a good movie, with good effects, good actors and an even  greater storyline, see Deep Impact.

0385493800|2.0|A fascinating beginning that drops off into what appears to be Grisham's effort to show the world that he's been to South America and has an eye for detail.  There are some very interesting parts to this book, but overall,  very disappointing for this Grisham fan.
B000002NIW|5.0|The Deftones are one of the greatest heavy bands of all time and Around the Fur does not disappoint.  Strong songs are My Own Summer, Around The Fur and Headup (with Max Cavalera of Sepultura/Soulfly fame).  I had the  honour of meeting these guys last summer in Vancouver and they are really  nice guys.  They rate right up there with Fueled By Ignorance.
0553573403|5.0|Martin appears to be on his way, with &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;Clash of Kings,&quot; to writing what may become one of THE major works of fantasy fiction.  Both works are among the best fantasy fiction  written in the past 20 years, and certainly stand among the handful or so  of serious fantasy fiction.  The plot is complex, the world medieval with  living detail, characterizations multidimensional and mature, with intrigue  that is Machiavellian and a plot that never flags nor loses itself in its  intricacy.  A great amount of realism exists, not only in the midieval  description of culture and customs, but in the ambiguity of action and  character.  Both male and female figures are prominent, perspective is  varied, and sometimes good people die and malicious people prosper.  And  the main characters are not immune to tragedy.  There is a well-developed  mythology here, as well as history:  Both are original and inventive.  Magic and religion play a role, but neither are intrusive or overstated.  And, for once, the presence of dragons is believeable.<br />If you are a fan  of fantasy at its best, don't miss these!
B0000047CX|4.0|The quintessential &quot;Bossa Nova&quot; sound that proved to North Americans that Charlie Byrd was right, Brazil was a &quot;Lost Continent&quot; of music.  It changed the way we looked at rhythms and  sensuality in music.  A must own for people who like to hear seminal  changes and flowing rhythms that were &quot;outside the box&quot; in the  early 60's.
B000005RFK|5.0|My introduction to Black Sabbath when I was yet metallically virginal over 18 years ago, especially with the initial track &quot;Wheels of Confusion&quot; with its instrumental follow-up &quot;The  Straightner&quot;, this album taught me that Black Sabbath was the rightful  title-bearer as the progenitor of more than a decade of imitators and  emulators.  Transcending beyond the social taboos of the occult and the  &quot;drug culture&quot;, Black Sabbath delved into the introspective world  of the mind, the soul, the world of philosophy and natural religion. Check  out Bill Ward's fury on &quot;Wheels of Confusion&quot;. This is the germ  that gave the rockers of the eighties their prenuptial impetus. The raucaus  &quot;Supernaut&quot; is the original party anthem, while the elevator  classic &quot;Changes&quot; pre-empts mellow Sabbath classics the  capricious &quot;Fluff&quot; from Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and the lugubrious  &quot;She's Gone&quot; from Technical Ecstacy. No Sabbath collection can be  said to be complete without this staple rock collection. NOTE: Ozzy lovers  will NOT be disappointed.
014028009X|5.0|I also thought this was a funny book - and you don't have to be single to relate.  Also a thirty-something girl, I found myself laughing out loud and forcing my husband to read the funny parts.  And who could not relate to  Bridget when she dated the young &quot;whippersnapper&quot; who told her  &quot;You're all squashy.&quot;  Very funny book.
0393317552|3.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel, starts with a great title, and an impressive premise in the form a compelling question. As posed by a native of New Guinea, a friend of the author who in some ways reminded me of Watson  asking Holmes how he knew the man sitting in the parlor collected postage  stamps and took the morning express from the Highlands... Hmmm,not so  elementary,Watson...your question. Or maybe even closer to the mark, the  scene where Crusoe meets Friday, the fellow who becomes Robinson Crusoe's  man servant and friend when Crusoe is ship wrecked on the native island.  You get the idea... <br />The question posed is essentially, how come the  Wests got so much cargo? i.e., stuff, and we New Guineans don't. <br />The  book details and examines the question in an  academic's way of looking at  things,and as a result,the book's greatest strength is also its weakness. (  In all fairness I must say that I didn't read the whole book, the reason  being that the bookstore was closing soon, and I had come there to find a  CD anyway...) Nevertheless, I got enough of the sense of it to say  that,hey, Professor, nice try but you missed a kind of important point --  entirely.  I don't mean to sound facetious, at least not entirely. All the  factors that Diamond considers, the ones he gives weight to are in their  own way very interesting, and I'm sure, valid points... Environment is  crucial. Mountains make nice walls for people to peek over and see what the  guys next door are doing to solve problem A, B, or C, and how can they copy  or innovate their own answer to it. Or better yet, just take them over by  force and steal it. That's always been a standard human approach to problem  solving-- theft.  However,environment aside for a moment,excuse me but  didn't you leave something kind of important out of your analysis? Wasn't  Religion a somewhat significant thing in the West? This incredibly potent  force which has propelled Western history for two thousand years,this  titanic need to, shall we say share our conception of God with our  neighbors, whether or not they have invited us to the party, isn't that  pretty much standard Western mentality and normal proceedure? Bring in more  advanced technology, impose religious beliefs, crush obstacles or people  who are crushable. Take what they have,in the name of religion and manefest  destiny.  Hasn't that been the because in answer to the West's global  hegimony. Religion driven motives propelled by all the other factors and  issues mentioned in the book,of course. But when you write a book  attempting to shed light on this question of why the West (won or took  depending on your vantage point) the West, and the World, by extention, it  seems kind of important to mention this little thing called Religion...  <br />Having said this, and I apologize if I missed the chapter on religion,  there are many wonderful nuggets in the book.  It's definitely worth a  read. I especially liked the photographs of the people. I do think we tend  to forget what people living in other lands look like, innundated as we are  with idealized images of ourselves. Though I consider myself to be almost  completely egalitarian and free from predjudice, I was amazed to see in how  many ways my own thinking is strongly biased. For example, I did think of  the natives of New Guinea as some kind of stone age peoples lacking in some  way in what we so confidently think of as intelligence. The book forced me  to look at my own reactions to peoples,  and made me realize just how  biased I am in so many ways, consciously, and unconsciously.  <br />As for the  future, well, I'm afraid Diamond's as much in dark as anyone in predicting  where we are going... English has ascended to the preeminant language of  the world, and we are the lucky recepients of this fate, or accident of  history.  But intelligence and geography, and human needs will shift. The  Chinese, as we are learning lately in Washington have been vastly  underated. Perhaps we'd be wise to begin reading more books about Chinese  history, philosophy, and, ehem, religion.
0553108034|5.0|Martin appears to be on his way, with &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;Clash of Kings,&quot; to writing what may become one of THE major works of fantasy fiction.  Both works are among the best fantasy fiction  written in the past 20 years, and certainly stand among the handful or so  of serious fantasy fiction.  The plot is complex, the world medieval with  living detail, characterizations multidimensional and mature, with intrigue  that is Machiavellian and a plot that never flags nor loses itself in its  intricacy.  A great amount of realism exists, not only in the midieval  description of culture and customs, but in the ambiguity of action and  character.  Both male and female figures are prominent, perspective is  varied, and sometimes good people die and malicious people prosper.  And  the main characters are not immune to tragedy.  There is a well-developed  mythology here, as well as history:  Both are original and inventive.   Magic and religion play a role, but neither are intrusive or overstated.   And, for once, the presence of dragons is believeable.<br />If you are a fan  of fantasy at its best, don't miss these!
B00000F1D3|1.0|but sure isn't no dance music.  Someone needs to re-educate some folks here in the US what dance-pop music is all about.  The beats are not strong enough, the lyrics don't make too much sense, and the tempos are just  between 'it can be pop music' and 'it wants to be dance music'.  Don't  recommend it at all
B00000BKDS|5.0|Without a doubt, this album changed my life beyond recognition. First purchased just months after its inception, this album broke the spell that Van Halen held on me for months prior.  The relentless rawness of this most  incredibly critical overdose of electric warfare puts you in the trenches  of rock's most decisive moment.  Highlights on this album are undoubtedly  &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;,  &quot;Transylvania&quot; and the haunting, tortured &quot;Strange  World&quot;.  As a teenager I listened to this album 45 times a day until I  had to buy a new one because of the wear.  From your first listening you'll  note the presence of bassist Steve Harris, the brainchild of Iron Maiden.  Long gone but not forgotten is singer Paul Di'Anno and his prowess in the  cuts fore-mentioned. Not for weak-stomached rock fans, &quot;Iron  Maiden&quot; melds Sabbath, Zepplin and Priest precedents into a new,  unforeseen mold that only these five musicians could forge. In your face,  rapacious metal all the way.
0679722610|5.0|All those writers that flood the market these days, who cannot write a book of less than 500 pages and who think a &quot;violent&quot; story means also &quot;gross and gruesome;&quot; all those intellectuals that cannot  see pith in dime novels, they should be locked up somewhere with this very  slim book and not be released until they have learned some facts of  literature.This is a gem of a book, from the unforgettable opening  paragraph to the final &quot;he gave me merry hell,&quot; there is not one  word, one comma or one period too many. Hammett can describe a character or  a situation in five lines, the way a good painter may draw a human figure  or an object with just five strokes of the pencil. The plot is tight, raw  and yet elegant; however not to be recommended for people with short  attention spans, because it has so many twists and turns, and more  characters than a Russian novel. This only adds to the interest, though. I  have read this book over and over and always find new things about it.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Only a handful of sequels have surpassed their originals. 'The Empire Strikes Back', 'Terminator 2', 'The Godfather Part 2', and 'Aliens'.  A true masterpiece, Aliens, is the cream of the crop when it comes to Sci-Fi  horror, and no film has come close since its release back in 1986.  A  rollercoaster ride that doesn't let up.
078062369X|5.0|The story, the music (club scene is awesome), and the movie from the beginning until the end, will blast you away.  I recommend the soundtrack also if you like R&amp;B, Hip Hop, &amp; club music!  Great movie!!!
6303022901|5.0|This movie will mke you laugh, cry and think.  It's not over powered by one  or two actors, but instead is a fantastically written story with an all around strong cast.   You won't be able to get over how easily you  relate to the stories of misunderstanding, love, tragedy and hope here.   I've seen this film at least 7 times, and every time I take something new  from the film.<br />This is a great film to watch with sisters, mothers or  just great friends.  You won't help but make it one of your favourites too.
B000000WCA|5.0|Okay, I think the Spice Girls (the orginal ones) were some of the best things to happen to pre-teen girls.  It gave them a positive message and I truly believe it gave them some music that didn't have negative  connotations or crude lyrics.  I'm also completely amazed that even though  this album is two years old, people are still enjoying it enough to write a  review about it. That shows you they did something right!
630471288X|5.0|I watched this movie again because I wanted a great movie to fall asleep to, since I was having difficulty succeeding at the task.  Who the hell was I kidding?  Of course, as it has always happened many, many times with this  movie before, I got so absorbed with the characters, the excellence of the  direction, acting, cinematography, music...taken for a ride of  contemplation and emotion that at times I'll admit nearly brought me to a  tear - that no sleep was induced.  Once again realizing the beauty of this  film, I entertained the idea that it would be incredible to see this movie  on DVD.  I hopped onto Amazon.com to see if it was actually available.  To  my delight, this incredible movie will be released on DVD with some very  nice additions, on Sept. 1st.  Just out of curiosity, I read the 1st couple  of customer reviews.  Then I read the next group of reviews, down to the  bottom of the page.  Then I clicked on the link that read: Click here for  all 74 customer comments...   I read them all, and felt so happy to the  very end.  There is &quot;hope&quot; for humanity after all.   I am very  glad to share this genuine appreciation of great film-making with you all.
0684867621|4.0|I finally bought TGWLTG Thursday. I started reading it Friday and finished that night. it was a pretty good book. i think it is different from most of king's work. in fact i don't know if i'd call this book horror. the things  that are horrific about the book could be just in her mind, and that's what  i think they are. (well, the location, near TR90, makes me wonder about  that though). it was interesting the way i read it. i had gotten off of  work, and i was tired from the day before as well as work that day. i had  to take my two hour train ride to get home (after walking 45 mins to get to  the train station). when i got there, nobody was home, and i hadn't had a  key to the apt at that time, so i sat on the steps (very uncomfortable  steps) for 4 1/2 hours waiting for someone to get home to let me in. let me  tell you, when you are tired and hungry and sore and very uncomfortable and  you are reading a book about a lost girl who is tired and hungry and sore  and very uncomfortable...well, it adds something to the book.
B00000IQMT|5.0|This is a classical score that equals all the previous Star War soundtracks.  A job well done, Mr. Williams.  Keep up the brilliant work!
B000002LND|5.0|This is the most flattering tribute to Madonna I've ever listened to.  The recordings are just the way I remember them.  Madonna has come so far since &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;.  She has made so many number &quot;1's&quot; and  changed her look so many times, but that's what makes her Madonna and  that's why we love her!  This CD should be in the stereo of every Madonna  fan!
630460288X|5.0|The dialog between Sly and Sandra Bullock is great.  It's Bullock's big start.
B000001DYA|5.0|I bought this outrageous project brand new in eight track, a thousand years ago.  It has not lost its shine in all of these years.  This was an era when heavy metal was getting started and these bad boys were using  Marshall Amps (then at $20,000 a pop)to let us know the shape of things to  come. This project must be played at a million decibels in order to enjoy.  Just make sure your speakers can handle it.
6301008723|5.0|am watching it today on A&amp;E network and want to buy the video but does it come captioned????????  reviews never tell you and thats all I can buy..
6303213650|4.0|This film does not hold together as well as some of the Coen Brothers other films (notably &quot;Fargo&quot;), but it is amusing and leaves you with a good feeling. In other words, it is entertaining.
0684867621|5.0|This isn't a horror novel and shouldn't be construed as such.  What King has done is to pen a great tale of adventure, courage, and coming of age in the story of a 12 year old girl lost in the woods.  While gone, the girl  comes to terms with her parents' divorce, learns to appreciate her family,  including her surly older brother, and discovers a spirituality of sorts  along the way, all with the help of her favorite Red Sox pitcher, Tom  Gordon.  Don't be driven off by that &quot;thing&quot; in the woods though.  One word...bear.
0380973464|5.0|I'm now 1/2 through the book and it is very difficult to follow the story after 3 am.  This is a great book and you just won't be able to put it down.<br />The author does a great job of weaving technology into the story.
B000002KIT|5.0|This album is a must if you enjoy live music media. I have life the 2 CD set and the BBC live albums and this one. This one was done in 83 and it is a great recording of a live show. I think some of the tracks were recorded  in Dallas Texas is a plus. I never had the chance to see a live show but to  know that the boys played there gives me chills.
B00000IQMT|3.0|John Williams did the best he could here, unlike all the other Star Wars soundtracks there isn't the distict transition of good and evil themes. We only get hints of the empirial march (as should be since the empire doesn't  exist yet), to make up for this, we're given the incredible &quot;Duel of  the Fates&quot; which has kind of become the Episode I theme... If I could  have found the &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; single, I would have bought  that instead of the entire album.
B0000026VZ|5.0|when my buddy first put this cdon i laghed.  i thought toto to be just another silly eighties band. man was i wrong. these talented bunch of musicians wowed me with there great musical talents and there incredible  harmonies.  there musicianship is on a nother level.  they are overlooked  as one of the most talented bands out there.  and as a drummer, the late  great jeff porcaro gave my playing a whole new meaning. i beg you to give  it a chance.
B0000027K7|4.0|OK, the critics are right.  Mountain was loud and crude and not nearly as talented as Cream.  But back in the early seventies I bought three of their albums and played the grooves off of them. Maybe it was because I liked the  way the bass rattled my floors.  I just dug out my old copy of Climbing  and, yeah, thats it.  My Advents haven't had a good workout in a long  time.<br />  Don't waste time listening to the samples on your tinny little  computer speakers.  Buy the CD and play it loud through a good stereo  system.  I still like this group!
0688172377|4.0|I found this book very easy to read and difficult to put down.  It brought up many emotions from laughter to tears as she discussed her life from her childhood in Somalia to her life as a model in London.  This book caused me  to reflect on my own life and gain a better understanding of those who live  in the developing world.  If you liked this you may also like 'Do They Hear  You When You Cry' by Fauziya Kassindja.
B000002GYW|4.0|I was introduced to this cd in the car of one of my friends. Very soon, I had a copy in my possession. I had never heard some of these songs before in my life! Some songs such as &quot;Outlaw Man&quot; deserve to be hits in  their own right. While a couple of tracks disappoint me and are the reason  why I cannot give it 5 stars, the power of the tracks I do enjoy, have made  me recommend it to many people.
038533348X|5.0|Cat's Cradle is a book that I read for a book report recently, and it is one of the best book's I have ever read.  The character's are great, though Kilgore Trout isn't in it, and it is easy to follow.  Though the Bokonon  references seem strange at first, they are necessary to the character  Jonah, they prove to be essential to the book itself.  This is the perfect  book for fans of Breakfast of Champions and Welcome to the Monkey House.
014028009X|5.0|IF YOU ARE A WOMAN, YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK !! I read this book in a couple of hours, but it felt like minutes. Offers the most hilarious insights into an average woman's persona. Living thru Bridget Jones, you  quickly realize that all women are essentially kindred spirits, from  obsessing over each calorie, to inviting company over and regretting it  before they even get there. If you ever thought &quot;there must be  something seriously wrong with me&quot;, read this. I have passed this book  on to almost every woman I know, and we all admitted to laughing out loud  in the middle of the night, it's that funny !! Enjoy!!
B000000IUD|5.0|I was entranced by this Album at age 5, my mom couldn't get me off the headphones with it at in 1974..  And she was ok. with that...  This is a concept recording of deep feeling and fantasy..  Makes me warm inside, yet  precautious of the state of a rapidly changing world....  Travis
0783228317|1.0|I find it difficult to believe that anyone in their right mind would find this movie entertaining. You couldn't pay me to watch it again. It has no story, no plot, and no dialogue worth listening to. It is a huge zero with  nothing worthwhile to offer. Actually, it is below zero...way below! I  liked Johnny Depp in &quot;What's Eating Gilbert Grape&quot; but after  seeing him in this piece of crap, I will never watch anything he does in  the future as he has proven to me that I can not trust in his judgement to  choose a decent script. There are so many good videos available, don't  waste your time on a garbage movie like this one!
0060925000|5.0|I have never read a book in which the characters are so vividly portrayed. The political chapters are well executed and make the book more than just a love story (which would also have been an excelent novel). The characters  and style of writing transported me to post-war India, where I spent many a  happy hour with this book in my hands. A wonderful read.
B00000ILDE|5.0|This is the best i have ever seen,alien-bashing is never been this cruel...arrghhhhh..!!
0812550706|5.0|I know that all of the reviews for this book praise it, so I will tell you an unbiased review..... IT WAS GREAT!!!!! The entire book was like a  great movie because I could picture it all in my head! I was 12 when I read it  and I couldn't put it down! I read it in only a week! The entire book was a  trie masterpiece but since I said that I would give you an unbiased review,  I'll nitpick. The only bad part (which is not very bad at all) are three  short, but sort-of gruesome parts where there are physical confrontations  between two boys. But other than that it is the only book that I would  actually read twice! (something that I thought would never happen) If  you're trying to decide whether or not to buy this book, it's WELL worth  the price!
0060975768|5.0|I finished reading this book on May 1, 1999.  The authors have done a magnificent job.  I was enthralled and reduced to tears, especially by the later chapters of the book.  The account is so vivid--I doubt it could be  better done.  I have certainly not read anything so poignant on Vietnam  since Fortunate Son, The Autobiography of Lewis B. Puller, Jr., which I  finished on Feb 6, 1994.  This book reminded me of the classic World War II  account, Company Commander, by Charles B. MacDonald, finished by me on 11  April 1995.  This is one of the best books I have read in a long, long  time.
0156528207|5.0|When I received a version of this book to read in my Spanish class, I thought that it was just going to be a stupid little children's book. I even went out and bought the English version of the book because I did not  want to bother reading it in Spanish. However, once I started reading it, I  discovered that it was much more.  This book is one with many different  levels and a great deal of meaning to it.  It makes you laugh at the  charming universal truths that it brings to light, but it also makes you  weep with sadness. You come to love the little prince just as the author  did. This book is a definite must read and I would recommend it to a person  of any age. It will truly change the way you look at life and I look  forward to giving it to my child to read when I am much older.
B000001FQQ|5.0|I love this album because it gives us what we like. Good solid lyrics in a structure that is awesome. It is the first Kiss album written on keyboards and the first with Pauls wife co writing. It also features many selections  written by Michael Bolton including &quot;Forever&quot;. I love  &quot;little Cesar&quot; about Ace Frehley's need at that time to get back  at what he calls the two jews.
0399143904|1.0|After enjoying many of Tom Cancy's books, I must admit this was probably the last one I'll read. The whole book is full of cardboard characters in make-believe scenarios, taken out of a shoot-em computer game. Clancy is a  great writer, and used to research his books well. Too bad he missed  big-time with this one... So as not to completely ruin the plot if anyone  still wants to read, I won't go into the many factual and tactical mistakes  of the book, but they are just waiting to be found.
B000002H72|5.0|One of the few albums I know of with no bad songs- every one a masterpiece that sticks in your soul.
B0000069KS|5.0|This is the best video they made, right up there with A Hard Days Night!!!!!!!
B000002JA8|5.0|After purchasing several other PSB albums first, it took me a while before Bilingual started to grow on me and I began to realize how good it really is.  The boys manage to maintain their disco sound while bringing in new  music and rhythms that are unlike anything else they have done.  This is a  truly great album, not my favorite (Very, of course), but consistently  entertaining, fresh, and at times, absolutely brilliant.  Like some other  reviewers, I too could care less if the Boys are gay or what their politics  are--they can just plain make great music, and that should be all that  counts.
0767903811|2.0|Yes there are many humorous observations and bits of irony, however, I found this to have a little too much &quot;David Barry&quot; type writing in it.  I very much enjoyed his last four travel books.  His clever and  insightful observations (along with the wonderful dialogues he becomes  engaged in) do not work as well in this &quot;collection of newspaper  essays&quot; format.  While reading his other works, I was always sad when  they were finished.  I was fairly happy when this one ended.
6304117272|4.0|I loved this movie when it originally came out in the theaters. Ed Harris has always been one of my favorite actors. Wonderful special effects; guess my favorite is the sea water &quot;tube.&quot;<br />I use this movie in my 8th  grade science class at the end of our study about oceans. The students have  to watch it and classify which things they see are actual science and which  are science fiction. We talk about Jules Verne and 20,000 Leagues Under the  Sea.
B00000IGGA|5.0|There's a fairly consistent thematic march through Tom Waits's albums from shady characters through increasingly outrageous and dangerous types down to Bone Machine.  Bone Machine is about death and usually hell.  The  question with Bone Machine was, where to from here?  It took me several  passes through that album to be able to appreciate it.  What could go  further?  <br />Redemption.  Mule Variations is the most thematically  different album of Tom Waits's career.  When all is said and done, in a  world of Bone Machine, you got to get behind the mule every morning and  plow.  People who think this is a retro album aren't paying  attention.<br />&quot;House where nobody lives&quot;, however, is the first  clunker I've heard from Tom Waits.
B00000IOSU|4.0|The new album Mirrorball by Sarah is bound for greatness. It is a cd that any die-hard Sarah fan will truly love and enjoy. However, being the Sarah fan that I am, It leaves me wondering when she will decide to release a cd  with new songs. I am a lover of the old ones, and feel that a live cd will  influence more people to go see her on tour. but for all of us fans that  have been following her for years, a cd with some new songs would probably  make us a bit happier.
B000002GXX|5.0|This CD is very good with some great songs not included in thier greatest hits package.  Check it out, the songs (and very accurate portrails of life (#8)) grow on you.<br />And by the way, the tracklist is 1. One Of These  Nights 2. Too Many Hands 3. Hollywood Waltz 4. Journey Of The Sorcerer 5.  Lyin' Eyes 6. Take It To The Limit 7. Visions 8. After The Thrill Is Gone  9. I Wish You Peace
B00000IQMT|4.0|Wonderful Music from John williams.  The only disapointing bits are as follows: 1.  Williams could have evoked themes for Queen Amidala, Qui-Gon and the Young Obi-Wan as he did in the original movie.  Not having themes  to &quot;hear&quot; the characters arrive is disappointing.<br />2.  The music  on the CD does not follow the movie, and is all mixed up - thus it is  difficult to listen to the music and visualize the movie in your head.   John W. why did you do that?  George L.  How did you allow that to happen?
0670813028|5.0|SCARY AS HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0788816454|5.0|I thought this was one of the funniest movies of the year.  If you don't like it, I'm going to &quot;open a can of whup a##!&quot;  But seriously it was a great movie that did have a great story line that is different from  Adam Sandler's other movies.  Also the supporting cast, including Kathy  Bates and Henry Winkler, was great.

068484267X|4.0|everyone in the world is reviewing this book, but i'll get my two cents in as well. the author deserves the pulitzer prize just for coming through this. what i dont know is how he could re-enact it by writing down every  last detail. i would have been off to the nearest hypnotist to induce total  amnesia, and i'm not joking. there is certainly no question here about  authenticity or writing what you know about. the detail is so graphic it  made me sick more than once (why 4 stars). this is not a criticism; good  writing makes you care about what is happening. it was particularly  interesting to me as i had just finished a book on nonphysical abuse in  families; while this father did not beat up his wife or children, and  professed to be loving and caring, he most certainly abused them by keeping  control of the money, which he spent on drinking, allowing the family to  literally starve and go without the most basic necessities. i wonder if  this woman and her children thought of the father as abusive. in those days  probably not. the other thing worth mentioning is that it seemed strange to  me that people still find the U.S. such a paradise. although these people  were living in the most terrible poverty, that no one anywhere should have  to live in, there seemed to be no gangs, drugs, guns, or violent crime. in  the U.S. these things are not even limited to poor neighborhoods any  longer, and even in the 1930s, the author mentions crime and gangsters and  gun violence in America. i think this is an important book and you dont  have to be Irish, Catholic, or poor to relate to it. Although it wasn't  pretty, I'll be interested in the sequel.
0380973464|4.0|Neal Stephenson is a very fine author with talent to spare. In many of the other reviews I read here people complained about his ending ... well I will buy that. However: the read was worth it. In fact, I would have been  content had there been another 900+ pages ... that is how amazing this  man's writing is, how interesting his characters are and how fascinating  the subject material he covers is. It will be hell waiting another two  years for him to gift us with another book, whether or not it relates to  the current release.
B00000IGGA|5.0|Not that Mr. Waits actually *cares* whether his stuff is embraced by the masses, or that there's a chance in hell, but, wouldn't it be nice if all those baggy pantsed &quot;hipsters&quot; currently running alternative  (yeah, right) radio actually put &quot;Big in Japan&quot; in heavy  rotation? In fact, there's music on this disc that's as good as anything  written for any popular musical style, i.e. jazz, blues, country, etc.
6305268835|1.0|Adam Sandler, while hillarious in Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, is absolutely boring in The Waterboy.  The moronic plot is shared by all three of the Sandler vehicle movies to date but this one is without origionality  or humor.
0385493800|5.0|I read the book in the last week and I really enjoyed reading it. This is my second John Grisham novel. The first was &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot;, which I enjoyed reading as well as this one. As an Exchange Student in the  Bible Belt here in Beaumont, Texas, I saw and experienced some really  strange things concerning christanity/religion and such things. Many  christian churches here, I  would describe more than sects with strange  beliefs and I'm an opponent of their attempts to missionary other people.  Because I think every faith is exactly the same right and wrong like the   other ones. What I didn't like that much was how  the natural  religion/faith of this native tribe was described. Surely they are  opponents (missionary and &quot;medicine man&quot;) but  you can't just  dismiss their beliefs as wrong. I see it now different about missions, but  what I still do not like is, when missionaries are sent by churches who  think everything what's in the Bible is literally true and try to convince  others that they are right. This is dogmatic and doctrinary. Dogmas and  Doctrines are an abuse of the sense behind faith and religion. So far, my  little criticsm. But, however, I enjoyed reading this book.
B0000024JN|5.0|This CD is great, i recommend it to anyone! accept for all those bastards who don't like them lol
0385493800|5.0|I was not incredibly excited about reading this book as I read less than flattering reviews, however, loving Grisham novels as I do I gave it a shot.  AND IT WAS GREAT!  The story was quite different as it centered on a  recovering alcoholic and addict as he searched out an unsuspecting heir to  a huge fortune.  Nate O'Reilly (the main character) found himself in the  Pantanal of Brazil in search of a woman who did not want to be found.   Meanwhile, back in the States, the other heirs, all greedy underachievers  at best, hired lawyers to stake their claim to a fortune they were  rightfully left out of.  Normally Grisham's tails take us through court  room dramas or other legal excitement but in The Testament, all such legal  matters took a back seat behind an interesting and witty character as he  soul searches and tries to overcome his past.  Don't believe the reviews  and GIVE IT A SHOT!
0780625129|2.0|Ok, i admit, i was totally blown away by the shock factor of the first half of this movie. Gutsy, Gutsy, Gutsy. But after that, it totally falls apart. It goes from the shocking, disturbing truth to the ultimate  hollywood cliche: &quot;Guy realises he's done wrong with his life and  wants to make everything right.&quot; This movie turned cheeseball in a  matter of seconds. Pointless scenes litter the last half of the movie. The  writers cheap attempt at trying to explain Edward Nortons character's  hatred was a joke and totally unnecessary. Couple that with the predictable  ending and you have a typical sub-par hollywood movie. It's really too bad  too, cuz the first hour is amazing. One thing is for sure though, Edward  Norton is one of todays best young actors.
B000002P6R|3.0|A great album, but could have done with less keyboard work and more guitars.  The album is enjoyable, but has an air of pathos about it, as one realizes Pete Townshend's mental state around the time of the album's  recording and release.  The album sounds as if the Who were trying to  distance themselves, sound-wise, from their pre-&quot;Who Are You&quot;  days, and modernize, but they don't a very good job of it.  My favorite  tracks are &quot;Cache Cache,&quot; &quot;How Can You Do It Alone,&quot;  &quot;You,&quot; and &quot;Another Tricky Day.&quot;  I would rate the  album higher if it sounded more earthy and raw, just like the Who of old.
0671015206|5.0|Without a doubt the best financial book, because it addresses the basics, and it is rooted in common sense. Although this book does not go into the details of personal finace: IRAs, 401, etc, its focus on a frugal lifestyle  is much more important. I believe that almost anyone in America  who lives  in accordance with the the very simple principals of this book, will become   wealthy. Maybe not a millionare in their lifetime, but they will be worth  at least hundreds of thousands of dollars.
B000002AGB|5.0|I am a big Who fan, and i was quite impressed by this great live recording, if only I had been alive in the '60's and '70's when rock and roll was so great.  I also have Live at Leeds, another great Who album, and  this may even be better, mostly because it has more tracks, including  almost all of Tommy. Overall I would recomend this to any fan of the Who,  or any other rock fan looking for a great live record.
B00000292K|5.0|Maybe it isn't, but it's damn great anyway. There are only two compositions on this CD:apparently a collective improvisation on the opening medley, and four variations on 'Black Satin,' recorded in June and  re-recorded in July. 'Satin' is one of my favorite Miles compositions,  mainly because its simple theme and bass vamp open the sound up in a way  that gives the soloists and rhythm section plenty of space to work their  magic varitations. Two of which, 'One and One' and 'Mr. Freedom X,' only  have the rhythm track, like a modern remix. This CD has been rightly called  the first hip-hop album. Miles himself has never sounded worse, but this  record is not about single players. Listen to the amazing electric piano on  'Helen Butte' (the first 'Black Satin'). Sure, In Concert, Dark Magus, and  the Pangaea/Agharta concert are better realized than this CD, and  significantly those are all live albums. Nevertheless, this is Miles's  electric manifesto, more than the sessions released on In a Silent Way,  Bitches Brew, Jack Johnson, and the Fillmore CDs, and it begins here.
B000001EL7|5.0|This was the first album I ever bought at the tender age of eight years old. Back then, I just liked the make-up and the great melodies, but as I have gotten older, my appreciation of this material has changed. In an age  of rap and politically correct whine-rock with no tune whatsoever, Kiss is  certainly a refreshing change. Love Gun is about sex and rock and roll,  pure and simple (Kiss never sang about the drugs). The songs are full of  melody, and the lyrics won't leave you depressed about life. Kiss certainly  didn't waste time whining about what their parents did to them when they  were kids or about how unfair life is like way too many modern rock bands  do.  Kiss was more interested in having a good time.  If you don't  understand that, you probably won't like it.<br />Love Gun shows more polish  than previous Kiss records.  By this time, Kiss really knew how to write  songs with great hooks that could grab the listener.  The album is  consistently good, which couldn't even be said for the album considered to  be the all-time Kiss classic, Destroyer.  The really strong tracks here are  &quot;Got Love For Sale,&quot; &quot;Shock Me,&quot; and &quot;I Stole Your  Love.&quot; For those of us who hate being politically correct,  &quot;Christine Sixteen&quot; and &quot;Plaster Caster&quot; are great  songs, too. I really can't imagine any of the Pearl Jam or Alice in Chains  clone bands releasing songs like that today. Maybe that's what makes it so  fun.  <br />Sure, I got into the more &quot;serious&quot; alternative bands  when I was in college. After I started losing interest in music altogether  several years later, I came back to the stuff like this that made me love  rock and roll in the first place. Love Gun isn't just nostalgia for me  anymore...it's a classic I'm glad I rediscovered.
B000008GS2|5.0|I splurged on the tape after &quot;Electric Blue&quot; hit the airwaves, then promptly wore it out. From the romantic &quot;Crazy&quot; to the story-song &quot;Man of Colours&quot; to the epic-rock &quot;Sunrise,&quot;  the music is consistantly good - an amazing feat in an era characterized by  one-good-song albums (remember  GTR, Dexy's Midnight Runners, or T'pau?)  The lyrics rise above the usual pop fluff or obscurity-as-profundity.  Overall, an excellent recording.
B000002L7G|5.0|This is, quite simply, my favourite CD ever.  It's  the first album I ever bought, and it's still never been knocked out of the number one spot.  If I'm in an upbeat mood, I can listen to Money for Nothing or Walk of Life.   If I'm in a quiet mood, I can listen to Brothers in Arms or Your Latest  Trick.  And whatever mood I'm in, I can listen to the rest of the songs.   Simply wonderful.
0804106304|5.0|The reviews of Joy Luck Club seems to be either good or bad. And there are some obvious groups to be tied with both. The bad reviewers include: Chinese who think that this is a negative portrayal of themselves or  immature seventh-graders who find it &quot;boring&quot;. The good reveiwers  include: Americans or Asian-Americans who let this book touch them without  picking on the stereotypes that, actually, reign in this novel. To start  off, let me just say that I admit that this probably isn't the MOST  accurate novel. Nor is it history. But it isn't a negative portrayal of  Chinese-Americans at all. I am an Asian-American and I enjoyed this book  because it showed Asians as real people, good or bad. And that women were  oppressed and treated like dirt in Chinese society is a FACT, like it is in  most cultures, Asian or European, etc. Why must we pick on it because of  little things that really don't matter? It's a touching story, whether it's  real or not. Perhaps those reviewers who complained that it wasn't accurate  enough also hated &quot;Mulan&quot; for having gongs sounding the music.
B000002A3T|5.0|As Pink Floyd produces yet another album, there is a sense of wistfulness about it, alluding perhaps to the rift between Roger Waters and the band, created by his exit in 1984.  For those who are mired in the  conceptualization of progress, i.e. that albums must be nearly  categorically different to show that a band is striving ahead, whatever  that means, this album is not for you.  Progress is an overrated quality in  an album, and gives the listening public an ever increasing dose of bad  music as musicians try to keep up with critical demands for change.   Whatever happened to the standard, \\"stick to what you're good at?\\"  Pink  Floyd does exactly that in \\"The Division Bell.\\"  Starting with Cluster  One we are introduced to the now classic instrumental that is Pink Floyd's  calling card, an unearthly tone, with a backdrop of earthquake-like  rumblings, setting up what is recognized as their own cosmic ambience.   Looking ahead we can see that this is perhaps a transitional album for the  group, and at the same time, a conciliatory attempt; or conversely a  reaffirmation of their own identity, as the group Pink Floyd.  What Do  You Want From Me, asks just that question, to the audience, to Waters, but  the ambiguity is classic Pink and the album works at both levels  throughout; in all probability, they are inquiring of both.  Poles Apart,  the second cut, describes the situation for us, and leads us into a sense  of isolation and alienation.  These emotions are played out for us in the  instrumental, Marooned, combining various techniques that are recognizable  Pink Floyd trademarks.  A Great Day for Freedom is ironic as the title  clashes with the morbid tempo and rhythm of the song, but that morbidity  certainly plays well as we find ourselves moving from the alienation of  Marooned into the ghastly image presented by Wearing the Inside Out.  The  price for freedom from isolation, that the expectations of our culture  force us to be other that what we are, that is, inside out, is reflective  extravagance, but well worth the effort.  Take It Back, once again,  presents us with a dilemma, and is the apex of the album.  The lyrics are  surprisingly sentimental, but illustrate the complexities of conciliatory  gestures.  Whether the conciliation is directed at Waters, or is a  solidification of the group without him remains unclear, but the sense of  personal crisis remains.  It also illuminates the hope for something  better, in a nihilistic fashion of those suffering depression.  That hope  is realized in Coming Back to Life, as the past fades and a sense of  identity comes to us, along with a gradual recognition of individuality, as  the \\"I\\" is realized.  Keep Talking, with its introduction by Stephen  Hawkings,   For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals   Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination   We learned to talk. leaves the rest of the album behind, lyrically, and  gives us a positive prescription for meaningful socialization, emphasizing  the dialectic method, popularized by Socrates and Plato.  We also find, in  this particular song, speculation on the idea of progress.  Is it something  that is created through work, or as the introduction suggests, merely  chance that allows us to realize a preexisting condition; or perhaps a  combination of the two?  This prescription is itself challenged in the  following song, Lost for Words, warns us that the dialectic must remain  open.  \\"A cauldron of hate,\\" and \\"tunnel vision\\" are only two of the  metaphors used to illustrate the possibilities most often utilized by  humankind.  Building off this, one can see isolation and alienation  creeping back into our consciousness.  The album ends with High Hopes, but  leaves us hanging in the vacuous ambiguity created by popular culture, due  to the inability to choose between the dialectic and stereotypical  behaviorism.  For whom are the hopes high, the band in its transition, the  people with whom it has carried on this dialectic, or perhaps in Floydian  style, the world at large?  For those hoping for a great change in  style, the album will be a disappointment, but one wouldn't expect Billy  Joel to sound like Pink Floyd, so why change what has become a hallmark  feature of the band?  The running footsteps, echoing and/or interlocking  guitars, sustained piano chords, and other Pink Floyd standards are all  still there, meaning that you will know its Pink in the first few chords of  any song you hear.  If one wants new instrumental ideas, look  elsewhere, but if you are looking for a tightly wound conceptual album that  is willing to speculate on philosophical and psychological issues, check  out The Division Bell, by Pink Floyd.

6305350205|3.0|Look, how can you top the Trek Trilogy (Star Trek II through IV) which preceded &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;? Star Trek V isn't all that bad. It would have made a pretty good TV episode, as well. The comedic elements  were overdone, perhaps because producer Shatner wanted to recreate the  humor which made &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; so much fun. Get this,  &quot;Trek&quot; fans: wouldn't &quot;Star Trek V&quot; had been much more  poignant had they done a scene in which Sybok brings Kirk's innermost fear  to the surface? Especially if that dark feeling was Kirk's regret at not  rescuing Edith Kheeler, way back in &quot;The City on the Edge of  Forever&quot;? Imagine if Joan Collins reprised her role, and, with Sybok's  help, haunted Kirk with &quot;Why didn't you save me, Jim?&quot;. That  scene would have been the movie's &quot;piece de resistance&quot;.  Nonetheless, &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; is decent enough Trek.

630242335X|3.0|&quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot; is a flawed but inspired effort. It is solid enough to be a valid farewell to the crew of the NCC-1701A starship. The plot is a bit contrived and frantic at times, and the  mistakes a bit glaring (books needed to translate Klingonese, on the  Enterprise? McCoy needed to load a missile? oh well...they were nice, if  odd touches). And what happened to the Enterprise shields towards the end?  Aren't they sufficient to stop the cloaked Klingon ship from inflicting  damage? However, as a send-off to this beloved crew, this movie is good  enough, with its final act bringing a tear to the eye of every Trek fan.
B000002UEB|5.0|It recently struck me how much X-Philes would love this album.  It's got the inner psychological struggle, the flashes of psychosis and despair, and, on top of it all, the awesome conspiracy.<br />That said, I won't gush  for this album, as many others have done so for me already.<br />Instead, I'd  like to offer some direction for those interested in finding something  new:<br />1.  Iron Maiden's &quot;Powerslave&quot; or &quot;Somewhere in  Time.&quot;  True, Bruce Dickinson's voice isn't as refined as Geoff's, but  the sense of drama and power are more present.  The intelligently written  lyrics combined with strong melodies and arrangements should also appeal to  'Ryche fans.<br />2.  Dream Theater's &quot;Images and Words&quot; or  &quot;Awake.&quot;  Often hailed as the inheritors of the path the 'Ryche  blazed (along with those blazed by Rush, Yes, Marillion, Iron Maiden,  etc.), the complexity of composition plus the strong super-competancy of  the performers appeal to those with an ear for MUSIC.<br />3.  Anthony  Burgess' &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot;  Don't bother with the Kubrik  movie until you've read the novel.  The book is SO much better.  Don't  worry if your head hurts after slogging through the Nadsat in Chapter 1; if  you survived the first chapter, the other 20 will follow easily enough.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|The first single off the album is catchy and the chorus is good but she didn't write it nor is she singing the chorus.  Her voice is awful the worst voice I've ever heard.  It just goes to show that anyone can make an  album if you have the right connections and people writing for you.
B000002TYX|3.0|I'm glad Volume One is available if only for historical reasons. Free As A Bird works pure and simple. It certainly isn't up to the stanards the band established, but it's better than anything The Stones have done in the past  10 years.<br />An observation was made that The Beatles weren't a great live  band. To the contrary, if you listen to other bands (The Kinks, The Who,  The Rolling Stones, etc.) from recordings made around the same time they  sound about the same in terms of playing ability. So, they fit in with  their time. To compare their playing to contemporary stuff is like  comparing apples to oranges( or the Stones to the Beatles).<br />They were a  terrific live band. After the grind of Beatlemania the band's playing was  fine but the inspiration wasn't there. They felt like robots going through  the motions.<br />Volume 2 &amp; 3 were better.
0385493800|5.0|When I began to read this book, I was amazed by the talent that Grisham has.  He's very descriptive and accurate.  He creates questions in your mind and then later answers them.

B000001DQI|5.0|As all the reviews to date indeed demonstrate, this album rests on its laurels as the quintessential Elton John album of all time. I couldn't have been more than 7 years old when my sisters brought this unending gem home  when it was first released in the early 70's.  Each track became a standard  in my soul as they played it over and over throughout my youth.  Elton's  power, authority and drama is sustained from the very first notes of the  tyrannical &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot; to the last fading echo of the  endearing &quot;Harmony&quot;.  This album is just as much about great  music, and what it should be, as it is about Elton John himself - a man of  tremendous passion and creativity. A world-class original. For me the  deepest point of the album is definitely &quot;I've Seen That Movie  Too&quot;, a defiant and haunting lament of rejection and unrequited  love.<br />&quot;So keep your auditions for somebody, who hasn't got that much  to lose, 'cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting, I've seen that  movie too.&quot;<br />I pity those who didn't grow up on this album. I really  do. What a waste!
0800103661|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies! It brings you inside of a fantasy world, that is actually possible, but just not to the same extreme as the movie brought it. As the news the other day or week brought out that  scientists have found a gene linked to how long you can possibly live. I  found this movie so interesting that I usually end up watching it two times  or more in a row. The director Andrew M. Niccol did a wonderful job making  this movie, and also Ethan Hawke played a great role. All I have left to  say now is, BUY THIS MOVIE!!!
0385493800|5.0|I find most of Gresham's books get my attention immediately and have the ability of holding it. This book has a different flavor than his other books. Not all court room drama, but enough. A story with a personal note  mixed with compassion and remorse. The ending was well done. Not like some  of his books that seem to end abruptly. As if John was just tired of  writing.

079283965X|5.0|Tomorrow Never Dies is a great action movie which also succeeds as a Bond film. It follows the Goldfinger formula pretty well and has all the elements Bond fans know and love. M and Moneypenny have much larger parts  than normal, but sadly, Q's scene is rather short. The film is filled with  far more sexual innuendoes than usual; it almost become a Moore film in  that respect. The ads touted non-stop action and the movie delivered in  that aspect. There are more gunfights, explosions, brawls, and shots of  Brosnan running that I can count. The stunts are great and well  choreographed. Bond's HALO jump looks real, as does he and Wai Lin sliding  under the helicopter's propellers (the best stunt in the film). Even the  parts that don't involve some life-endangering situation for Bond are also,  for the most part, well done. Carver's sinister plan is developed  sufficiently, but I never really believed he was the cruel man he pretended  to be. The things he does hurt him inside; after ordering the death of his  wife, he sits alone at a table, sulking. He did show the usual villain  insanity when he compared himself to Napoleon and Caesar. Why do all Bond  villains usually compare themselves to tyrants of history? This time around  there are plenty of girls for the non-monogamous Bond. First he &quot;picks  up some foreign tongue&quot; from a Inga Bergstrom who is teaching him  Danish at Oxford. Next he beds Paris Carver. Finally, he and Wai Lin don't  respond to cries of &quot;Commander Bond, Colonel Lin, are you out  there?&quot; so they can stay and enjoy themselves on the wreckage of  Carver's ship. As for Wai Lin, the first Bond-equivalent Bond girl, she was  fabulous. For the first time, 007 doesn't have to tell the girl to  &quot;stay here and wait for me&quot;. He can give her a gun and some  limpet mines and she is off. As usual, the locations were breathtaking;  they really made Bangkok look like Vietnam. As for Bond in this one, he  seemed much more like thespy of Fleming's novels. He womanizes, drinks  alone in his hotel room, kills without reservation, and actually gets hurt.  Perhaps the best example is when he kills Dr. Kaufman at point blank range.  The main problem with the movie is that somewhere during the motorcycle  chase it began to go downhill. The chase was too long and what followed it  was not all that interesting. Bond and Wai Lin had to go through the  cliched &quot;I work alone&quot; bit, and then finally arrived at &quot;ok,  let's team up&quot;. It just seemed like a waste of time. The scene in the  Vietnamese equivalent of Q branch was a nice touch, but again, too drawn  out. Then, the ending was terrible. I didn't like most of the final scene  on the stealth ship. The edge-of-your-seat tension that many Bond movies  have was missing. I never believed that Bond or Wai Lin's lives were in  danger. The best scene was when Bond had Stamper shoot the man he just  killed so Stamper would think Bond was dead: classic Bond technique. Elliot  Carver's death by the sea drill was the worst one since Kananga's death by  inflation. It didn't give me any satisfaction and was made too obvious  before it happened. Another bad move was to turn Stamper into a typical,  muscle-bound grotesque henchman. He really showed a sinister side when he  gunned down the 17 helpless men in the water without blinking an eye. After  that he just became another one of Carver's big bullies. He never seemed to  get the same joy out of killing, and the part where he talks about being  Dr. Kaufman's student was just pointless and took away from his character.  In the end he fell into the trap that so many henchmen get into:  invincibility. Bond stabs him two times and he barley winces. That killed  any credibility and finished the ruination of the character. But aside from  all these peeves, it was still a pretty good entry into the Bond series:  especially with no more Cold War to fall back on. After six viewings of the  film I mustsay that it is one of the most reviewable Bond films in a long  time. With the exception of a few scenes, I managed to lose myself in the  movie each time I watched it. However, the more I watch it, the more I hate  the use of slow-motion. It is just not needed and takes away from the  overall quality of the rest of the well-directed movie. Finally, the  movie's quality during some of the dimly lit scenes was not too good. It  was grainy and looked like the movie was not fully processed before  release. The last movie this happened with was The Spy Who Loved Me and it  bothered me then too. Still, one of the best entries in years.
B00000J8EK|5.0|The new Chemical Brothers &quot;Surrender&quot; is ready to take over the planet.  Thanks to local/web radio station WFNX Lynn/Boston, I was able to hear it in its entirty on Sunday night.  This is funk-soul electro boogie  from a far off universe, where technodroids create sonic soundscapes that  jump right off the disc and morph into a dizzying collage of samples,  special effects and(drumroll please)yes, GUITARS.  Fans won't be  dissappointed at all, cause this disc is filled with all the stuff that  Chemicals are made of.  Robotic loops that morph in to other loops  hypnotize the listener while seamlessly mixing into a whole new sound  before you can shake the trance.  The Brothers treat special guest  vocalists from Mazzy Starr, New Order and Mercury Rev just like any other  samples and twist and splice them up until they're all part of the Chemical  Brothers psychedelic mind-warping experience. My personal favorite is  &quot;The Sunshine Underground&quot; a pure dose of Chemical bliss that  will send summer raves into techno overdrive.  Make no mistake about it.   This is THE album that will rock your block off this summer.
0670881791|4.0|I liked this book and found its depiction of a small French village and its people delightful. I think that a few reviewers who have criticized this book for chrurch bashing have somehow missed the point. Reynaud, the  austere priest who sees the newly opened Chocolaterie as a threat, strongly  follows a (now hopefully outdated) brand of Calvanistic religion that we  must all suffer a little, and live narrow, pinched lives in order to get  closer to God. Non-comformist and slightly pagan Vianne he sees as a threat  to this, when actually all she is preaching is that a little of what we  like can do us good. This is therefore not just a simple battle between  good and evil, but between a brand of religion -  often preached in small  hideaway village communities - that is so narrow-visioned as to leave  parishioners constantly burdened with guilt rather than rejoicing in life.  Vianne allows them that long held back rejoicing, but it could just as  easily have been a new priest with more open views about life and a better  understanding of his parishioners' needs. Just ask yourself what Father  Reynaud's reaction would have been to Mary Magdalen suddenly turning up in  the village, and you'll have your answer: Reynaud's founding Christian  principals are not just outmoded, but repugnant. They deserve to be bashed!
6300182355|4.0|Some movies are best watched alone.  Some it doesn't matter.  This is one you should watch with good friends who like to hoot and giggle and who don't mind it if you have frequent breaks for comments.  Its 1950's serials  with great color.  And surprizingly, the characters do have some shadings.
0140277447|2.0|Japan's government has indeed acted cowardly in refusing to face up to the full dimensions of the horrors committed in the name of the Emperor.  And yes, there are revisionists claiming Japanese children will suffer emotionally for having been exposed to \\"fantasies\\" about sex slavery and the Rape of Nanking. For revisionists history should be a string of happy moral  tales that will help children cultivate pride in themselves and their Japanese heritage.  It is important to recognize that such an attitude is not necessarily representative of the whole of Japan. It is, rather, one that seizes our attention, often filling us with a sense of righteous indignation.<br />The Japanese today are not even remotely like the nationalist fanatics described by Iris Chang. The Chinese, ironically, come closer to that stereotype. Their form of patriotism, their fixation on military culture, and obsession with national prestige whether in science or sport are, at least on the surface, worn with an unflinching pride.  And don't forget the quiet contempt held by the Han for certain minority groups in China.<br />In China, not Japan, I saw mentally ill people sleeping naked in the middle of busy streets, their bodies blackened with months of mud and grime. In a post office I saw a retarded boy get kicked in the seat of his pants for laughs. A British friend working at a university campus of all places saw a child with Down Syndrome being beaten by a group of 'on-campus personnel' wielding broomhandles. In China I saw women fistfighting in the markets. You rarely see behavior like that in Japanese society. <br />I have no doubt in my mind that the Japanese soldiers could be brutes. But the way Chinese treat their fellow Chinese - as I have observed from personal experience - reveals the plain fact that a lot of indignation toward Japan about what it did in World War II is political, pure and simple.<br />Japanese are today far more generous and open to the world than they are given credit for. China should be as content, comfortable and forward-thinking as Japan.<br />Finally, it should be  said that the Rape of Nanking is not a big secret kept from the Japanese  people. While many are ignorant about it, many also know. The suggestion  that there is some conspiracy of silence is misleading even if  understandable.<br />Iris Chang has what it takes to make a media event out of this book which, as scholarship alone, deserves the criticism it receives. Chang's study of what took place at Nanking is buried under so many layers of rage and bitterness that you can barely discern any shadow of credibility.

B00000IGGA|5.0|Another amazing musical excursion with Tom Waits.  Not at all a dissapointment.  Tom Waits continues to create some of the most important and inspired music in America.  Go out and spend the money as soon as  possible.
1573226521|2.0|This book could have been a decent read; that is if the characters were even half realistic.  They all are a group of pleasantly brain dead gen-x'ers who show no emotion at all.  Only good part is the scenery.  If  you are looking for a fast read with a foolish plot and empty characters,  try this book.
0790736314|5.0|The film, I have to admit, has been the most disturbing as well as haunting movie I ever saw in my life.  Still it leaves profound impact on my mind whenever thinking of any episodes of the movie.  Linda deserved the  Golden Globe Award she won for this masterpiece, to whom I have to thank  for having scared the hell out of me for these years, by the way.<BR>   Don't miss any chance to watch this horror classic (Golden Globe Winners  for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress...)  But  afterwards, beware of your bed and see if it shakes as you turn off your  lamp.<BR>THE EXORCIST is terrific!
0767814622|5.0|The Turkish prison system, like many others, in developing (?) countries have little if any regard  basic human rights, let alone legal rights.At the time this happened I had a friend who was married to a Turkish women,  they had twins-born in the US.When the wife w/children attempted to leave  the country the children, boys, were not allowed to leave-they were  considered Turkish citizens.  US State Dept did nothing; finally a  signifnicant bribe was made to several officials to release the children.
B000000OQF|5.0|With great songs like &quot;welcome to the jungle&quot;, &quot;nightrain&quot;, and &quot;sweet o' child of mine&quot; it's no wonder this cd is the best in my collection. guns n' roses has the best  intro's and the best guitar playing in the business. Their new cd's just  don't have the juice mostly because I think they smoked a little to much  weed.
6304044836|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies.  The communication and development between characters is more mature than the original.  It is more romantic and believable than the original too.  I have watched it 50 times and see  something new each time.  Perfectly cast and cleverly played, the sublime  humor fits this &quot;better than the original&quot; version to a tea.  I'm  waiting for it to come out on DVD.
B00000JCB3|5.0|Hey, do yourself a favor and buy this cd. Anyone that liked 3 dollar bill will love this cd. Believe me, you won't be disapointed.The whole band has become noticably better. This is the crap to buy.

6302638771|5.0|I saw JFK and I have to say it blew me away with the storyline from the get-go I never really gave much thought as to who was involved in his tragic murder I just assumed it was who they said it was and I didn't  question the goverment's case until now. The movie JFK makes you think  about that day in dallas long and hard. I would have to commend OLIVER  STONE for his insight into this american tragedy which many have condemmed  him for. Sort of like what happend to the man KEVIN COSTNER plays in this  film who he plays I won't say just watch and you'll see what I mean. Anway  see JFK you won't soon forget it.
B000005RFM|5.0|Sabotage is not Sabbath's best (Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath and Heaven And Hell edge it out), but it is one wild ride worth taking over and over again.  Particularly impressive is the way that all the songs kind of blend  together into one seamless web of madness, anger, unabashed sexuality, and  instrumental mastery, as though Pink Floyd, Judas Priest, Deep Purple, and  Django Rheinhardt (sp?) were all put into a blender, with Satan's finger  deciding when to push the &quot;puree&quot; button.  Although the Sabs made  two more albums with Ozzy after this one, things just weren't the same, as  probably 85-90% of Sab fans will agree, but thank God they made one more  genuine stomper in the '70s: Sabotage.
078062369X|5.0|Great action, an in depth, captivating plot, and Wesley Snipes. Who could ask for more? The thing that makes this movie so good is that the good guy- Blade- isn't perfect. Yes he's got awesome abilities, and seems  indestructable, but he's just as mortal as everyone else. This is a great  movie, and one you HAVE to see at least once. I've seen it twelve times!
B000002KMY|4.0|Perhaps the pressure was too great for our heroes to follow up on Heaven and Hell with another masterpiece, so instead they put out Mob Rules, a respectable though hardly life-changing release.  Perhaps Dio was right  when in an interview it was like the band was trying to repeat what worked;  they never stoop to self-parody, but the disc never quite touches the soul  the way its predecessor does.  &quot;Turn Up The Night&quot; is like  &quot;Son of Neon Knights,&quot; and we can make other comparisons, but  Vinnie Appice sounds right at home, Tony's solo in &quot;Over and  Over&quot; is one of his best ever, and the bass lines are (as usual) just  mind-blowing.  Get it.
0395645662|5.0|I first read yhis book when I was ten and found it very easy reading. This book simply turned my life around and is one of my favorites. What would have given the author this idea?
B000001FA4|5.0|Kurt Loder reviewed this album quite negatively when it was first released in October of 1984 (I was 4 years old at the time).  He actually headlined it as &quot;Alliance with Eno yields flawed album, U2 flickers and nearly  fades.&quot;  14 years later I'm thinking &quot;what the Hell!?&quot;  Not  only is Bono's voice at its most passionate pinnacle, but Edges's  atmospheric wall of guitar makes the album so beautifully mysterious.  The  guitar lines literally shimmers like crystal in &quot;Promenade&quot; and  &quot;Bad.&quot;  It squaks and screaches in &quot;Wire.&quot;   &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; is breathtaking along with its etheral  keyboards and piano.  But I remember when I first heard &quot;Pride&quot;  when I was still in elementary school, it sent a chill down my spine as I  listened with widened eyes.  I recognized the song, but never made any  attemp to find out who the band was.  Years later I see it on MTV, and  demanded it for Christmas years later in '92.  I immidiately became a die  hard fan and marveled at Edge's immidiately recognizable six note intro of  &quot;Pride.&quot;  The polyrythm just blew me away, I was stunned at its  complex, yet bright and shining chords that embodied the dignity and honor  King possessed.  The music did justice to the story and memory of MLK,  sending chills down my spine over and over again.  I still listen to Bono's  passionate vocals (which were never matched on any other U2 release) and  the breathtaking guitar work, truly making the album unforgettable.
6303443214|5.0|This movie is excellent it's one of my most favorite movies of all time. Brad Pitt and TOM CRUISE were superb! But I read the book and the book made alot more sense, but this is the first movie that is very close and does  justice to the book. If you haven't read the book, you are missing out on  alot. But I love this movie 4-ever, I just wished they didn't make Lestat  such a tirant. PLEASE MAKE THE NEXT MOVIE, The Vampire Lestat!
B000002BMD|5.0|Not one band has ever affected me the way as the Manic Street Preachers did, when I bought a copy of &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;. It has everything: powerful anthems, stirring production, vocals out-of-this-earth  and beautifully reflective lyrics. Rock music history re-written again.

6300182193|3.0|While not scary in the least, Frank Langella does give an elegant, three dimensional, and the most seductive rendition of the UnDead Count yet. Watch closely and you'll see a twist in the movie, in that, this time, it  is not Dracula who's the villain, but, in some ways, his pursuers. The  women he seduces appear in danger-they're enjoying it and are being  &quot;rescued&quot; from the confines of the stiff Edwardian Age. This  version anticipates the Coppola version of the 90's, which made turned the  bloodthirsty Count into an Undead pursurer of lost love.    Though as far  from Bram Stoker's original conception of the Count as an ancient, bestial  warlord, Langella does elevate the character to classical status in his  interpretation. Also, noteworthy is the photography and production design.  A real treat for any Dracula or vampire fans.
0140042520|5.0|Dahrma Bums by Jack Kerouac has forever changed my life. It has tauhgt me that life is a valuable thing that should not be wasted. Wasted with worries, work, materialistic pre-occupations, and with how others may  perceive you. Dahrma Bums is an eye opener. It totally blew me away. Go out  and get and live your life.
6300270726|4.0|Whether viewed as an homage to (or ripoff of) &quot;Shane,&quot; or an inferior retread of Eastwood's own &quot;High Plains Drifter,&quot; the  director-star's last western prior to the Oscar winning  &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is beautifully photographed, well-acted by a  terrific cast (most notably Michael Moriarty), and exciting, if not  particularly deep.
B000009CEM|3.0|I bought this cd based on the fact that i loved Demanufacture and Soul of a New Machine.  At first I was disappointed at how weak the lyrics are, and how cheesy the guitar riffs are.  It seems as if Fear Factory are now a  trendy band trying to sound like metal.  I hope this is not true.  They  have done better, and I am very disappointed in their change in style of  music.
B00000ADG2|2.0|For reference, I have been following Lauryn since I first peeped &quot;Vocab&quot; back on the Fugees' first album.<br />As for now, it's years later, and she drops two deadweights and goes out on her own. I find the  album is immediately likable, but only two of her songs can withstand  repeated listenings. As a hip-hop junkie, I still like the first track,  filled with clever (albeit a bit soft) battle rhymes. And as a hip-hop  junkie, that's all I like. The rest is a bad mix of hip-hop and R&amp;B,  which seem to be mixed just for the sake of mixing hip-hop and R&amp;B. The  results are songs like Ex-Factor, an otherwise perfectly lovely song if it  were not for the ultra annoying &quot;yo yo yo yo yo&quot; background  Lauryn insists on putting in.<br />Oh well. I was looking forward for Lauryn  to blaze the trail for the new generation of female hip-hoppers. Now  instead of creating an exquisite hip-hop album, she made a sophmoric  R&amp;B album that is embraced by pop fans one month and totally forgotten  the next.
079213690X|5.0|Gee, it seems that a few Brits are a wee bit upset with this movie.  At least James Upton Briscoe's excellent review told us where the artistic license took place.  Actually, who cares if it's accurate or not?  I don't  recall a film (based on a true story) that I thought was without artistic  license.  While I may agree that more movies should try to educate, anyone  who believes that these types of films (or any film, for that matter)  portray accuracy are living in a dream world.  Are we all getting that  touchy, that we must blast a film (ghastly, pathetic crap, propaganda,  etc.) soley because it doesn't portray what historians studied/recorded and  \\"believed\\" happened?  The accuracy of any event is subject to change and  challange depending upon whose side one happens to sit.  The Brits, who are  both our most stauchest allies and most severe critics, must have made a  few movies that bent the truth just a tad (granted, &lt;I>Braveheart&lt;/I> may have  twisted it more than necessary).<br />Personally, I enjoyed &lt;I>Braveheart&lt;/I> the  \\"movie\\" (not the documentary).  I thought it was an excellent film,  sweeping in scope and beautifully filmed.  I thoroughly enjoyed the love  story(s) in the film.  It is a brutal movie replete with extremely bloody  scenes, so it does take a strong stomach.  Another movie that I enjoyed  very much was Stanley Kubrick's \\"Spartacus\\" and I see many similarities in  these films (accuracy not withstanding).  Between 1 and 10, I give  &lt;I>Braveheart&lt;/I> a marginal 9.
0800187792|5.0|Beautifully filmed, heart warming story.  I've happened upon it several times on cable, and each time I do I think I will go on to something else.  Instead, I catch myself watching it... again!  It's a breath of fresh air  in a time when most movies focus on who has the most  &quot;fire-power&quot;.
0783226160|5.0|Maltin also says &quot;Withnail &amp; I&quot;, &quot;Austin Powers&quot; and &quot;The Jerk&quot; didn't have enough comedy to sustain a feature film! EARTH TO LEONARD - you're missing out on some of the greatest stuff  ever - get a clue!
6305313687|3.0|The movie fails to tap in to the realism of American nazism.  It might as well have been a story about a redeemed young man trying to save his troubled young brother; because that's exactly what it's about.  The movie  has very little to do with Nazism, let alone racism.  It's quite a  conventional movie, filled with pseudo-innovative creativity.  It lacks  realism.  It wasn't poorly written, but the writing wasn't all that great  either.  Edward Norton's character is more like the screenwriter's  representative than a real live person.  This movie was made more for its  message than for its story.  It's worth renting but not worth buying.
0425156842|4.0|Sophie's world is a wonderful way  to present philosophy to people of all ages. It was nice to find a book that I can read and relate to. My father and i both read the book together and it was fun. I am a child, with a high  reading level, but it could still be a little confusing.I recomend it very  much to anyone wanting a fun and interesting way to learn about philosophy.
B00000DHRZ|1.0|God, I can't believe I wasted 20 bucks on this pile.  That's the last time I let band-loyalty drive me...now that I've listened to the crap that is Americana, I can go back and listen to Smash and realize just how excellent  it was.  This, however, is an abomination.  Whereas Smash had the classic  angry rock and punk tunes, Americana has reverted to &quot;happier&quot;  tunes.  Listen to &quot;Why Don't You Get a Job&quot; and then &quot;Bad  Habit&quot; and see what I mean.  I never though I'd say this, but the  Offspring have turned into a hybrid of N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys...
0375707972|5.0|Great for discussion groups because it presents at least four morality issues.  Endless discussions for students and book groups.  Appropriate for mature students.
6305364648|5.0|Though not in anamorphic format as it is claimed to be, this is a top DVD, one of the best in my collection. The picture and sound quality are outstanding, the film story is good and this is one of the better Arnold's  performances. If you like quality action films then get this DVD.
B00000IMCU|5.0|One of the great horror movies of all time. Violent, Gory, suspensefull and even funny. Gives you a feeling of total helplessness like Night of the Living Dead does. The music is a bit cheesy but who cares. It's over the  top and great. If you like horror you have to have it.
B000001Y2U|4.0|I used to think that Manson was a freak, until I listened to rock is dead. Then I bought mechanical animals. I loved it, everything was good about it. So then I bought the antichrist album. It wasn't  as good a mechanical  animals. But it did have at least 5 good songs (my opinion), compared to  mechanical animals that I practically loved all the songs. To sum it up, if  you want a CD that you know isn't too gothy but you still want mansons  great music, than go with mechanical animals but if are a manson fanatic,  then buy antichrist superstar. But remember whatever cd you buy remember  that Manson is still a great artist.<br />PS I am not a goth, I would never  wear all black stuff and worship the devil.
B00000IQMT|4.0|I am a fanatic for the old soundtracks. I love them. I have recently purchased &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;'s soundtrack, and was instantly stricken with awe at the first chords of the Star Wars theme. &quot;Duel of  the Fates&quot; was an experience. I liked how Williams incorporated some  vocal work, but not to the extent where it was relentless. After  &quot;Anakin's Theme&quot; (which was cleverly dubbed with notes from  &quot;The Imperial March&quot;), it seemed that the score was a  little...bland. One song blends into another, and the soundtrack picks up  at peaks in the music, but it doesn't have the same genius that the old  movies did. I was anticipative of this, of course. You can't match genius  twice (but Williams matched it three times in the old scores). I think we  all knew that George Lucas would bring it upon himself to make a perfect  movie, but never reach the height that the old ones beheld. It's an  impossibility, really. I like this new soundtrack, and found that after all  of the scores were over, the music picked up wonderfully with &quot;Augie's  Great Municipal Band&quot;, or the celebration song! I love that song! I  play it over and over! My votes for best tracks: 1,2, and 17. By far, one  of the best soundtracks- no!- CD's of the year. Fantastic work. --Annie-kin
0060925000|5.0|I wonder how anyone who ever read this book could rate it less than 5 stars... There is only one man whom I could compare Vikram Seth to, and that is, the literary genius, Tolstoy. I have read &quot;War and  Peace&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; but still, there is something  about Vikram Seth's language, his description, his use of words that is  undescribable. I finished &quot;A suitable Boy&quot; in three days, and  didnt sleep for a wink... the second time, I wanted to go through it  slower, and really get the pleasure of it, but alas, I finished it in four  days. Both times, on finishing the book, I felt as if the world that he had  built for me had just been snatched away and all that was left, was a sad  emptiness... This is by far the BEST book I have ever read. Reading it is  an awesome experience!!

0671576089|2.0|Having seen and heard Frank and Malachy McCourt on talk shows, I was anxious but trepeditious upon picking up this novel (memoir).  Trepeditious because both of them seemed like con men to me.  I think this is a whining,  complaining, self seeking journey with an ending which bespeaks the true  character of McCourt and his family, get-what-you-can, get laid, and get to  America.   My own Irish ancestors on my mother's side were just as poor,  had just as much sickness, has their share of drunks, and their own  personal tragedies.  Did they resort to knocking Ireland, knocking the  Catholic Church, making fun of native customs?  No, their faith was a  bedrock upon which their lives rested, their humor was directed toward  themselves, not others, and their poverty was overcome by honest means--not  by stealing.  This book may have been on the New York Times best seller  list for eternity.  It was a waste of my time. McCourt has a lyrical Irish  voice.  Too bad it couldn't have been put to better use.
B000002H97|1.0|I totally hated this album because There was so much hype involved with meatallica.  This was my first metallica cd and I was totally amazed at what I heard.  Critics said that thes guys were speed metal but in my  opinion there not.  The song writing and vocals were horrible as well as  the repetitve and bad sounding guitars and put it all together and you got  a shitty cd.  So don't be a fool cause Metallica isn't cool
B00000IGGA|5.0|My favorite Tom Waits albums are from the &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; period.  I like to hear him SING. I popped on the headphones at Borders Books and Music -- &quot;Big in Japan&quot; didn't sound like the Waits I  was hoping for.  But then I went to &quot;Hold On&quot; and &quot;House  Where Nobody Lives&quot; and &quot;Picture in a Frame&quot;.  I love this  album.  He seems to be singing in all his different voices and personas.  &quot;Come on Up to the House&quot; says that life is dark and difficult,  but the song lifts you up anyway. That's always been his gift, to me,  creating beauty out of life's darkness.  This particular song has a message  of faith I haven't hear from him before.  My favorite tune.
0395389496|5.0|This book is the winner of the 1986 Caldecott Medal for best illustrations in a book for children; and it deserved it. The story is about a mysterious night train that takes a young boy on a trip to the North Pole where he  receives a special gift from Santa Claus. It has, and will remain, one of  the Christmas classics for children. It seems that every child I know has  heard this magical and fascinating tale. I highly recommend it to every  parent and encourage you to make it a Christmas tradition with your  children.
B000002UAX|5.0|Now there are people saying the Beatles didn't &quot;rock.&quot; That's absurd. Of course they did. Listen to &quot;Yer Blues&quot; and &quot;Everybody's Got Something to hide...&quot; But they also did so much  more. There are so many styles lovingly parodied here, and molded into  memorable melodies. Something like &quot;Happiness is A Warm Gun&quot; is  genius in its pure form. The Beatles seem to have been great in ways that  people with simplistic criteria and one track minds can't fathom. And even  if you don't like this album, there is still no excuse to give it a mere  one star.. surely, surely it warrants more than that, ye extremists?  Personally I think this album is great fun.
0767817478|4.0|I own this DVD and I must say, OK movie, Excellent Special Effects.  While the story and acting was only average, I was blown away by the special effects and sound.  Powerful bass sounds fill the movie.  Just the thing to  show off the new subwoofer in my Dolby Digital Home theater.  So if you're  in for a high tech thrill go for this movie, but if you're just in for the  movie (without the exciting stuff) look else where.
B000002UAR|5.0|The world is truly blessed. Not only do we have every other Beatles album, and the Beach Boys' &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; box set, and Simon and Garfunkel, and Elvis, Dylan, and the Stones, etc.  etc... but we also have &quot;Revolver.&quot; What more does this sorry  world deserve?
0792151712|2.0|When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was pretty good.  It had an aura that made it very appealing to watch.  It was one of those movies that had a numbing effect on you when you left the theater     However, I saw this movie for a second time and I started to think more  critically about the movie  itself.  I think that the special effects used  in this movie are probably the best that can ever be developed to portray  the Titanic in any kind of production.        The acting was highly  overrated and too sappy.  The dialogue was horrible, just about anybody  could have played Leonardo Dicaprio's part with ease.  If the casting  directors would have picked a much more established actor with average  looks, the audience could have concentrated more on the acting and the  story line itself.  If this was the case, people might take this movie more  seriously instead of making a machary out of it.  In my opinion, rent it,  don't buy it.
B000009CEM|4.0|Not the best album ever (gotta give that one to AC/DC's Back in Black, but that's a whole different story), but definitely heads and shoulders above most of the schlock shoved down our collective throats now. This album is  excellently heavy, the riffs kick some serious a**, the rhythm parts are  awesome, and Burton's vocals have improved drastically. Listen to his  asinine vocals from Soul of a New Mahichine (ugh), and on this album.  Demanufacture was better then SoaNM, but Burton is no longer just shredding  his vocal chords, and has matured as a singer. There's some type of story  to the liner notes, but I haven't bothered to read it yet, but the music  doesn't suffer b/c of this. (That's a good sign.) All in all, one of the  best metal albums to come out since Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power  (possibly the DEFINITIVE hardcore metal album of all time), and worthy of  the extended playing time it's been getting on my CD player as of late.
B00004S8Q9|4.0|WHY WASN'T THIS CD RELEASED UNTIL NOW???  I'VE BEEN DEPRIVED OF 10 CLASSIC, KICKIN' HARD ROCK BADLANDS TUNES FOR 6 YEARS!  THESE GUYS PLAY  BALLSY BLUES INFLUENCED ROCK, WITH A LITTLE BIT OF MELLOWNESS THROW IN FOR  DIVERSITY.  I DON'T THINK IT'S AS GOOD AS THEIR FIRST CD, BUT THAT'S A HARD  ROCK CLASSIC BEYOND COMPARE!  BUT IT BLOWS THE DOORS OFF &quot;VOODOO  HIGHWAY&quot; (their 2nd release).  CLASSIC HARD ROCK THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED  TO BE PLAYED.  REST IN PEACE RAY... WE MISS YOU!!!
B00000IPAX|5.0|i totally agree w/ the guy from reno.  spread the love of the music.  what is wrong if some un-punky person likes the music?  blink will get more money, the albumb will sell more, and people will learn the love of some  GOOD music.  believe me i hate all those poppy bands, and i worship blink.  but what is so wrong about someone who is not u listening to the band?  if  blink didnt want them to listen than there would probably be some different  material on the album, or they would mention in on their webpage.  sucess  is not a bad thing, and i dont understand why u blame them for becoming  &quot;famous&quot;  for after all arent we all posing off of someone?  they  make music for the love of it, not to ignite a war invloving the youth of  america.  i am one who gets hounded for liking bands like blink, no use for  a name, mxpx &amp; rbf, and trust me its all a bout the music.  so dont  condemn someone for liking blink, rather love them. y not take it as  something in common, something to share?  must everyone who likes these  type bands have blue hair and a pierced eybrow? (i bet most of u  &quot;hardcore&quot; fans dont even have that) p.s. its an incrediblie  album.  by it, make it platnum
6305169187|5.0|Yes, this is a steroid injected, lots of dying, flag-waving, kick-butt, all-american, good guy always wins disaster movie...but there's no denying that its a totally entertaining flick.  People who say they didn't enjoy  this film are either lying, or are so intellectually insecure that they  find it necessary to &quot;out-think&quot; every improbable occurrence and  scientific inaccuracy that exists in the movie.  Get a life!  We don't get  any smarter riding roller-coasters either, but we do because they're  FUN..which is exactly why Armageddon is worth the buy.
B000002MY3|1.0|Whiny, annoying, not particularly original
0553274503|5.0|The book Flowers for Algernon was surprisingly original, modern, and suspensful.  A tale of an incredible metamorphosis through time, you find yourself sharing Charlie's feelings and wanting to be there to hold his  hand through the hard times.  This novel will inspire, encourage, and help  you to relate to the less fortunate.  We definitely recommend this book to  anyone interested in discovering an intimate look into the life of Charlie  Gordon, a truly unique human being.
0790729628|3.0|Call me what you will, but I much prefer the original to the Director's cut and will not buy the DVD of the Director's cut.  I would very much like to have a DVD version in the wide screen format however. Let's be realistic  here folks; neither version even vaguely resembles the book any-damn-ways,  so why should anyone care which version anybody buys?!  So, whaddya  say..can we have the Original on DVD?  (Which, by the by, I give 5 stars)
6305226296|5.0|Why do people always associate the Bee Gees fame to &quot;disco&quot;????  The Bee Gees were a &quot;Supergroup&quot; BEFORE the disco &quot;infection&quot; ever began!!!   And they are still pumping out great  music today!!!   This is a terrific collection of ALL their hits, yes,  (choke) even some disco. If you appreciated the Bee Gees for ANY of their 3  decades of music..... you've got to get a copy of this!!
B000002GQE|2.0|Listening to this is painful!!! Has Justin Hayward ever sung a note that is not off-key?? And his voice is so loud in the mix you can't ignore it-- no matter how hard you try!! When they remastered this they should have  processed his voice with digital pitch correction to at least make it  somewhat listenable--although it couldn't help the lifelessness of his  singing(?) style. I've always considered the Moody Blues to be a band in  desperate need of a singer, and listening to this all the way through for  the first time confirms this, though Mr. Hayward does manage to rally  somewhat for 'Knights In White Satin.' The extra star is solely for The  London Symphony and the album concept.
B000003S5H|1.0|My advice to young people in love, take your dates to an AIR concert. If they like it, break up with them. The same people who like this music are the same people who think Adam Sandler is funny.

B00000IFWE|5.0|After hearing &quot;Free Girl&quot; played on the radio, I bought &quot;Echo&quot;.  I enjoyed it the first time I played it, but the more I play it the more I like it.  It's all about fighting back and being okay  with yourself.  If you're a TRUE Tom Petty fan, you'll ignore the critics,  buy the CD and be glad you did!
630518299X|2.0|I was sadly let down by this movie.  After all the hype - I found way too many faults to enjoy it.  The fact that he was such an incredibly dull person - that did the same thing everyday - amazed me that people would  bother watching him for one hour let alone his whole life!  He would also  have to have been the dumbest person ever to walk this earth - only waking  up to strange events when he's in his late 30's!   Peter Weir is a  brilliant director - 'Gallipoli' being a superb movie and 'Dead Poets  Society' a true credit to him and Robin Williams.  The Truman Show was a  complete disappointment!
630468150X|2.0|Glamorizes the crimes of hardcore criminals, including a character whose nickname is derived from the number of women he has raped.  Deaths occur often in this film and are even supposed to be funny, like a black convict  chasing a plane he's trying to get on, and flipping off the pilot just as  he's chopped into a bloody mess by the propellers.  When people laughed at  that, I wanted to walk out.  The entertainment value doesn't justify the  casual, no-consequences approach to violence taken by the makers of the  film.
6305169195|1.0|A typical &quot;Bruce Willis Movie&quot; packed with boneheaded predictable violent scenes. In Armaggedon, this country's goverment, decides to put the whole worlds faith into the hands of a bunch of idiot  dirtball Oilriggers, who according to the movie, didn't even pass high  school! Gimme a break! This movie wastes a bunch of time and didn't get to  the core plot of saving the world enough.
6305263248|3.0|I really had trouble following the plot of this movie, and I think it's because it bored me.  It's somewhat off-putting when the stars of the film don't seem to have any values to speak of, nor respect for human life.   What I took away from this film was a sense of puzzlement over how money  could become more important to someone than the value of another person.   Very violent and depicts many civilian, bystander casualties without  portraying any regrets or consequences whatsoever.<br />I gave it three stars  because of the stylish car chase scenes and the fact that DeNiro was in it.
0871137380|5.0|Reading this book over the Memorial Day weekend added weight and meaning to this very powerful account of Americans dying for their country. I could not put this book down. All through the book I kept asking myself the  question &quot;why&quot;?  Its disturbing to think that so many lives were  lost in a mission of such little importance. I have been troubled by the  account on many levels but the book itself has the earmarks of being a  classic - every American should read it.
B00000FCBC|5.0|...if Metallica stayed in their 'Lightning' and 'Puppets' mode, people would be saying that they're not doing anything new.  But now that they've gone off in a different direction, they're called sellouts.  In the  meantime, I'll be waiting for the next album from the most dynamic hard  rock/ heavy metal band ever.
079213690X|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, which re-earths the patriotism and sacrifices Scotland endured for their freedom. It also recognizes the bravery and efforts of two less-celebrated but worthy  heroes, William Wallace, and Robert the Bruce. Yes, the film is not  historically accurate, but the spirit and gyst is there with a veil of  Hollywood romanticism. If you want accuracy, make a documentary and leave  it at that. In terms of a film, Braveheart was excellent - superb acting,  brilliant directing, a strong plot, and great battle scenes. Braveheart is  an epic film in every sense, well-deserving of the awards bestowed upon it.  As for the accusations of homophobia, quit judging it by our times and  political correctness - the word or belief &quot;homophobia&quot; did not  exist in the 13th century. Why should a historical film embody and follow  20th century social correctness?, for all those picking at the historical  accuracy.
B000002H2H|5.0|This one is definitly one of the best (if not the best) Metallica album there is. Want to know why?, two reasons called For whom the bell tolls and Fade to black. If you dont have this one, buy it, your missing the core of  Metallica.
6304708483|4.0|As one with deaf friends Im very disappointed, that this film (and HELP!) are not Closed Captioned for the hearing impaied. I had a friend who lost his hearing,and who was a very big fan of the beatles, and it has hurt him  greatly,PLEASE do something about this.
B000002OR4|5.0|John Williams' tasteful and subdued rendering of a score appropriate to the inconprehensible horror covered by the film helps guide us through this most-difficult, but very real, period of history.  The violin solos by  Itzhak Perlman surely must be worth all the years of practice leading up to  this tender, masterful performance.  Our children's children and their's on  down will hear this score decades from now when original films of the  actual Holocost are exhibited so even we non-Jews can have at least some  idea of the very terrible sacrifice of the Jews of World War II and so it  might never be repeated.  This is a must recording for ALL collections!
B000002UB6|5.0|O.K. It's not Sgt. Pepper's, or The White Album or Abbey Road and others.  We forget that we measure greatness against your past greatness.  If Mark McGwire doesn't hit 70 homers again, it would be a dissapointment.  Gee, he  only hit 55 this year!  Well, the Beatles raised the ante so far high, that  Let It Be at the time of their release  in 1970 was considered a big  letdown.  Well, if you listen very closely, you'll see it was still among  the best rock-pop ever done by this group and better than most other  releases from that time.  A lot of 1970 albums sound dated.  O.K. they  didn't hit 70 homers with this one, but they still led the league.  Time  has been kind to this sleeping gem!
6304331185|5.0|Best movie made this decade, hands down.  All the performances were great (especially Spacey and Palmentieri) and the plot was very engaging.  People who say they figured out the ending ahead of time are kidding themselves.
6303477259|4.0|I'm sorry, but I guess my expectations were too high.  After having seen D.S.O.T. dozens of times, I was hoping this would top it, but sorry to say, it didn't come close. The video (vs. film) format and camera work lacked  the edgy, dark feel of Delicate. The focus on stage-projected video  distracted from the performance, which seemed to lack passion.  Maybe the  band grew tired of performing this set between 1989 and 1995.  The  background singers weren't as powerful. The sax player seemed to be reading  sheet music, no soul at all. And where were the crowd shots? - no ecstatic,  mind-blown reactions to the show?  Was this supposed to be a concert  experience or a documentary?<br />On the other hand, if you like a mega-budget  light show with a decent sound track, you could do worse (I'd like to have  the money they spent on electricity alone). I appreciate the extra concert  length, and the fact that all of Dark Side of the Moon is there helps. But  if you're looking for that truly awsome, gut-wrenching,  lunatic-is-in-your-head experience, get Delicate Sound of Thunder.
0783113943|5.0|I've seen this movie zillions of times!  I first saw the rated version on HBO, taped it, watched it so many times that I about ruined the tape, then ended up buying the unrated version.  <br />This movie is what got me hooked  on Angelina Jolie.  She gives an absolutely outstanding performance.  What  more can I say...you need to buy this!
B000000W8C|5.0|This album is the greatest, certainly on my top three of all time. I have this, Urban, No Come Down, A Storm in Heaven and the Verve EP. They are all great and deserve a listen to. Before Urban Hymns, people would hear the  Verve at my house and ask who it was. I would tell them that they were the  best band that they had never heard of. Now, they are the best band that  never went anywhere.
B00000BKDZ|5.0|of the many great maiden albums, this one stands out as being a little different than the rest....this is definitely one of my favorite cds ever....
0451188470|1.0|My friend and I were intrigued by the write-up on the back of the cover and we decided to read it together.  Hard to say which one of us liked the novel least.  There were no sympathetic characters, the writing style is  completely unsophisiticated and the &quot;mystery&quot; didn't hold our  interest.  We're still blaming each other for picking it out!
6304147589|1.0|Following the excessive praise of The Deer Hunter, a very offensive and unintelligent film, Hollywood was expecting Chimino to be the next Coppola or Houston.  This film, however, proved that Chimino was and always will be  an overrated &quot;artist.&quot;<br />Isn't it interesting that the same thing  is happening to Quentin Tarritino 20 years later?  <br />I'm so happy that  Quentin Tarritino is slowly joining Michael Chimino in the &quot;over-hyped  and faded-out&quot; category.  Just go away, fellas.
6303965415|5.0|A bittersweet tale of life in Regency England during the time of the Napoleonic wars. <br />Anne Elliott is an unmarried gentlewoman approaching thirty.  The daughter of a vain, spendthrift and foolish baronet, Anne's  sense of duty led her, eight years before, to break off her engagement to  an &quot;unsuitable&quot; Lieutenant of the British Navy.  When at last  they meet again, Anne, who's youthful looks are gone, endures agonies as,  now Captain, Wentworth with a fortune far exceeding her fathers, plans to  marry - someone else.   <br />Outstanding performances by the cast - and  Sophie Thompson (Emma's sister, and actually a finer actress by far) gave a  truly masterful performance as Mary Musgrove.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I am a huge fan of Moby and I love this CD. It's a little different from his earlier stuff but it's amazing anyway. I don't think long time Moby fans will be disappointed at all.
6304346107|5.0|On occasion a little more fanciful than Miss Austen would surely have approved (e.g.Frank Churchill's portrait smiling seductively at our  heroine), &quot;Emma&quot; was generally a very pleasing and thoughtful  production.  Prunella Scales proved an excellent Miss Bates,as did the lady  who portrayed the vulgar upstart, Mrs&quot;E&quot;.
0800141326|3.0|GINO; &quot;Godzilla In Name Only&quot;, that is.<br />But really?<br />Despite all the running down of this movie by us so called Godzilla fans, the movie is a Godzilla movie and always will be. I must admit I was somewhat less  than enthused when I saw it in the movie theater (twice) but I always did  leave the theater giggling. Probably because it was *so* weak; a comically  lame attempt. But maybe it was just my reaction to unfullfilled promise and  disappointed anticipation. Since getting the movie on video, however, it  has grown on me to an extent and while certainly not amongst the best  Godzilla movies ever made, it certainly isn't the worst. Far better than  say, Son of Godzilla or Godzilla vs. Megalon.<br />So, while it isn't all that  great, it isn't all that bad either. And one must remember that Toho  themselves have made some real stinkers staring the big Guy. Thus I place  it solidly in mid-pack.<br />Hopefully when D&amp;E do a sequel, they'll learn  from the success, both critical and rating, of the Fox cartoon series and  incorporate appropriate changes.
0393314804|5.0|When I first saw the film Trainspotting I was blown away by one of the funniest and most creative films I had seen since Pulp Fiction.  When I discovered there was a book behind this remarkable film, I was determend to  read it.  Borrowing my sister's copy, I spent about a month going through  this book's 345 pages (it didn't take so long out of boredom, I'm just a  slow reader), and I ended up with only one conclusion...I HAD JUST READ ONE  OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER!!  Trainspotting is a hilarious, violent, and even  sickening book that takes us into and below the lives of a group of junkies  in Edinburgh, Scotland.  It takes us into the minds and emotions of several  characters, all who at one point in time act as narrator.  The book is  about heroin, sex, fighting, dead people, almost dead people, stealing,  cheating, but most importantly, friendship (or lack of).  It is a truly  remarkable book which, as &quot;Reble, Inc.&quot; says, &quot;deserves to  sell more copies than the Bible.&quot;

B00000J7RZ|3.0|It's amazing she's a wonderful actress and singer. Her video for If you had my love is awesome! It's definitely a party song because when you hear it you just plain feel like stopping what your doing and starting to dance.
0385493800|4.0|As I have read all of John Grisham's books, I liked this one, but it certainly did not come to, e.g., &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot;'s level.
B0000025L0|5.0|An innovative and dynamic work of art. Stanley combines the talents of many great jazz artists with his works to produce a sound that remains distinctive and original. I remember first purchasing this in the early 70s  along with Return to Forever, Miles, Coltrane and others of his skill.        The difference is the bridges and sequels within the melody.  Truly  amazing.
0393312836|5.0|Screw all the talk about politics and youth culture in the world when reading this book.  Throw out the reviews, good or bad, especially when they mention the graphic ultra-violence and sex which is very comman  throughout.  Instead, sit back, relax, grab a cup of joe, and enjoy a  funny, sarcastic, and exciting book from Anthony Burgess. <br />The story is  about a young man named Alex.  He is the leader of a group of droogs, or a  gang of friends as it seems, who spend they're nights getting stoned on  milk laced with drugs, beating up defensless people, and raping women.   Perhaps none of this seems very funny, especially in this day and age when  violent crimes are becomming more common, but the language and humor that  Burgess puts in the mind of his humble narrator, Alex, makes it nerely  impossible to resist.  Even during Alex's darkest days the book's humor is  kept in tact by the charisma, charm, and almost poetic languge used by our  Humble narrator.  and P.S., make sure you pick up the newest copy when  buying in the states...and older version won't have the final 21st  chapter...
0446343129|5.0|&quot;Sugar Blues&quot; will change you outlook on sugar forever.  It opened my eyes to pay attention to what I put in my body. This book is hard to read at times and does appear to be very opinionated, but it had a great  impact on my life.  I have been eliminating sugar from my diet and I have  never felt better. I had gained a lot of weight during the last year and  had little energy.  I have made a concious effort to put to use the tips in  this book and I have a new lease on life. My energy seems to go up every  day.  If you like this book another that I have read is:&quot;Get the Sugar  Out&quot;.  It includes a few sugarless recipes as well.  Please read this  book if you are having ANY health problems or a low energy level. This will  change your life forever.
B000000OPZ|5.0|This is Whitesnake's strongest effort. All of their albums kick substantial wads of flashy glam rock a$$ but this displays the band at it's peak. With it's emotional ballads like Is this Love and it's straight ahead  rock solid maneuvers like Still Of The Night and Bad Boys shows that  Whitesnake is the king of glam metal. Throw in Here I Go Again and it  disgraces any critic that ever penned a bogus review of Whitesnake.
0671027344|4.0|I thought this book has so much to offer the reader, and esp. a look at one young man's stuggle in the VERY crazy world of High School and being a teenager.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Best Limp Bizkit album to date. Definitely cool. Nookie rocks my world
630349255X|5.0|The most poignant and powerful film I have seen.  This movie shakes the viewer from her comfortable seat and calls her to question not only the dominant paradigm but personal values and beliefs. Baraka should be seen by  everyone because it has the ability to affect us all and calls us to  question our lifestyles.  The cinematography is incredible and the music is  carefully crafted.  Definately a film to be viewed on the big screen, but  this should not discourage anyone from renting it.
0399143904|5.0|This book was very much like Patriot Games, a lot of action and not as much technical description as seen in most of Clancy's work.  In my eyes Clancy is the best writer and Rainbow Six is another great addition to the  'Clancy Shelf' in my library.
0671015206|4.0|This book dispels many of the myths about who the wealthy are in America and how they live. We all know that movie stars, rock stars and ballplayers are atypical, but this books shows you just how atypical they are, even among the wealthy. If you think the typical millionaire thinks and dresses and eats like those featured on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, you will be very surprised by the facts presented in this book. I certainly was. Only 4 stars because the material could have been presented better.
6300184064|1.0|Bleak, disjointed, full of throw-away performances and embarrassingly bad attempts at humor and romance. <br />Gilliam flipped off the Hollywood Power Machine and won, thereby forever culling favor with critics and the art  crowd. It's too bad the rallying cry was this miserable, depressing,  migraine-inducing exercise in cinematic vomit. <br />Brazil is a misguided and  pretentious joke, a crude, gas-passing Emperor with no clothes. I'd rather  watch 100 hours of &quot;Mama's Family&quot; than sit through the damn  thing again.
6304366078|5.0|Grand Prix, is enjoyable many ways, whether you're a racing fan or not. I was lucky enough to see this movie in &quot;Cinerama&quot; as a 10 year-old boy when it was released and it instilled in me a life-long appreciation of  filmmaking and motorsports.  Having now grown up and having seen more of  the world, more motorsports, and more movies I love this movie more now  than I ever did at 10, but for different reasons.  For the racing fan in me  there is no end to the joy. There is a faint smell of gasoline in the air,  the blare of a weather beaten P.A. system, a slighty teary eye from too  many burnt hydrocarbons accumulating in too small a place too fast, a  slight ache high in my nostrils from airborn bits of burning brakes and  tire rubber, and the sweet hum of a high-RPM motor behind my ears when I  pop this in the VCR. There is no doubt this movie has POV shots of racers  in competition better than anything seen, before or after. The use of a  then revolutionary electronic and microwave camera systems developed by  NASA allowed for steady, clear 3/4's POV, close-ups, panning shots from  sideview to POV on the same car, as well as third person views of all  aspects of the actors racing inches from one another in real Formula 3 cars  (mocked up to resemble cars and liveries of the '65 F1 season)as they  followed cars driven by Phil Hill ('61 World Champ for Ferrari) around all  the iconic venues of Formula 1 at speeds sometimes as fast as 125 mph.  You  can see and feel the tension, the initial hesitation of passing a car at  speed and the exhiliration of doing it smooth, safe and clean in the  actor's faces because it was real.  The sweat you see is not makeup, the  wide eyes and clenched jaws aren't acting.  What you see are men who know  that one slip, a one millisecond lapse in concentration would be  devastating.  And this allowed the director, John Frankenheimer, an amateur  sportscar racer in his own right, to break down the barrier between make  believe and reality for his prinicipal actors, James Garner, Brian Bedford,  Yves Montand, and Antonio Sabato, Sr. The angst of the characters becomes  real for me, they aren't caricatures, because the actors reaction to these  experiences were those of the men they portrayed - I've know what it's like  to feel that I could be the best under the right circumstances like Pete  Aron (Garner regularly drove in sanctioned races after his appearance in  GP), I know what it's like to know your good at what you do but still  wonder if you're the best like Scott Stoddard (Bedford never drove a car  until GP), as a young pup I lived and loved in the fast lane like Nino  Barlini (they couldn't get Sabato out of the cars), and as an older man I  sometimes feel weary and mortal like Jean-Pierre Sarti (Montand, the  consumate frenchman, preferred the love scenes over the cars). The score by  Maurice Jarre is as exhilirating during the dramatic racing sequences as it  is gentle during the montages by Saul Bass exploring the driver's pysche as  they race.  What's different in this movie for me now -- not much, except  when I was 10 I thought the important characters were Aron and Stoddard,  Aron cause he was a good guy done wrong and Stoddard cause he was heroic.   I now realize the central character is Sarti, because Sarti was the  happiest.  &quot;Pete, do you ever get tired, of the driving? Lately  sometimes I get very tire, know what I mean? Very tired.&quot;
B000003BEV|3.0|It's an odd one, no doubt about that.  What can you say? Some brilliant stuff (&quot;2000 Man&quot;, &quot;2000 Light Years From Home&quot;, &quot;She's A Rainbow&quot;), and some of the other stuff they should never  be forgiven for (&quot;in Another land&quot;, the so-called attempts at  psychelic jams).  So, if you just want the cream from this album, get the  3-disc &quot;The London Years&quot;.  But, if you enjoy buying an actual  album, to see where the artist was at that moment, then, by all means, here  you go.
B000000W5H|3.0|The band was definitely suffering from a case of mid-70s over-productionism when they made this one. Waiting from Ron Wood and the punk movement to bring them back down to it in &quot;Some Girls&quot;.  However, unfortunately, you still need this album because &quot;Time Waits  For No One&quot;  is one of the best stones songs ever, and one of the best  rock ballads period. Mick Taylor's haunting guitar work on the song is the  capstone of his career with the band.
068484267X|5.0|Just a big thank you to Mr. Mc Court for sharing his story. All I can say is read it.
006017322X|5.0|Anyone who is contemplating buying this book should absolutely not hesitate.  In my opinion, you could not invest your money in a better book.  Personally, I think that after reading it once, you won't be able to keep  yourself from reading it again (which I would assume to be all the more  reason to buy the book).  Atticus, Scout, and Jem are wonderful characters  that only aid a story that couldn't have been written any more beautifully  than it was.  I have no complaints and neither will you!
B00000IL1K|1.0|With the exception of Titanic, the CD is truly disappointing.  Her normally melodic voice is constrained and overshadowed with poor music.  I threw it away! Don't buy it.
B000000H6D|5.0|Funny lads they are indeed. The cover made me smile, the inlay card made me smile more and more, and the music made me laugh and giggle from time to time. On a playing card morning in Cracow I got to know it and now it's  time to buy myself a copy. I thought it would be like something too scary  to think of, but it turned out to be an amusing mixture of Camel, Black  Sabbath and the Beatles, which are the ones that i really fancy
0790729628|4.0|The Director's cut doesn't have the stuff that the original has. The commentary by Harrison Ford makes the movie more then just a special effects movie. It gave the movie a heart and soul that most flicks just  don't have. More so, having read the book, I find the commentary put more  of what the author wanted it to be. I find the ending was cut short. I miss  his comment on the Officer in charge, I think it leaves the movie naked.  Understand that I have the movie and I like it. Just not as well as the one  that I saw at the show. I'm full of awe at the picture. I still find DVD so  much like being at the movies. It's one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all  time., but  get me the original movie version.
0385482582|4.0|The business advice was banal; but it's easy and generally fun to read.  At the same time I agree with a reviewer who said it's a poor source of recipies but it does subtly, eventually, stimulate you to think.  Just 164  pages in a large typeface, most of it being anecdotes.  Bring it to the  beach.<br />Andy Grove is very into winning for its own sake.  For example  when listing various kinds of loss that can occur when a company goes into  difficult straits (p. 124) he concludes with &quot;perhaps the most  wrenching, the loss of being affiliated with a winner.&quot;  As an  engineer, I was hoping to see a glimmer of joy in semiconductor products  and technologies from the chairman of Intel, and didn't see it.  The joy is  all in being one step ahead of the competition.
B000003TAW|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest albums of all time...The catchy tunes are tremendous, especially while on the highway...buy it..you will not regret it....
1558903259|5.0|Yes! This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. It really touched my heart, even though I not a very sentimental person. You could say it made me think in a different way, and that's pretty good for a movie  I believe.
0780626478|5.0|This movie was great, a lot better than I expected it to be, I saw it several times..:)  A lot of sweet moments, and of course, Brendan looks great, especially in the dancing scene..:)
B00000IPAX|5.0|OK, I haven't heard the ENTIRE CD yet (I am awaiting it's arrival via mailorder) But I HAVE heard half of the songs that are on the CD. Those that are saying Blink 182 is &quot;selling out&quot; to non-punkers just  because of the mellow sound of &quot;What's My Age Again&quot;, you must be  very judgemental. Have you ever heard &quot;Mutt&quot; or &quot;All The  Small Things&quot; or &quot;Dumpweed&quot; ??? That's still the classic  Blink sound we all love. I actually consider &quot;What's My Age  Again&quot; more or less an &quot;experiment&quot; of mixing in other  genres of music. There is absolutely nothing wrong with trying something  new. They are not doing this to become more popular, to win punk-haters  over.... but to take their musical talents and see how far they can push  it. I think they did a very fine job with this album (from what I've heard  so far) and you can expect the same, usual, immaturity and songs about  teenage life on this CD. Oh, if you really like Blink 182-style punk, you  should check out Goldfinger.
0374172897|5.0|This book blew me away, the first thirty pages about all I did was inwardly gasp.  Cunningham's choice of words, his utterly precise rendering of psychological states was stunning.  Certain passages haunted me.  This  writer is a master.  I can see where certain readers might be intimidated,  bored, or threatened by his themes and his styles; too bad for them.  This  work is about as stunning as they come.  I almost never buy novels (I take  them out of the library), but this is one I need to own, I will be  returning to it again and again.
0800132009|5.0|I specifically loved Alec Guiness's love for the bridge... and the realization of his folly... and who can forget the ending? &quot;MADNESS&quot; I loved this movie... a refreshing alternative to the  norm.

B00000J7RZ|5.0|Jennifer Lopez, actress. Jennifer Lopez, dancer. Jennifer Lopez, singer? Who knew? Already considered one of Hollywood's A-list starlets with numerous hit movies under her belt, and a former &quot;Flygirl&quot; on  Fox's &quot;In Living Color,&quot; Ms. Lopez is set to unveil yet another  dimension of her innumerable talents. The first single off &quot;On The  6,&quot; &quot;If You Had My Love,&quot; was produced by Rodney Jerkins  [Brandy, Whitney Houston], and is already burning up the charts. When  &quot;On The 6&quot; is released on June 1st,  it will undoubtedly be the  CD blaring from many boomboxes at Orchard Beach this summer. &quot;On The  6&quot; is Lopez's opus, a musical celebration of her life, her Latin  roots, and her own tribute to her childhood. The title of the album refers  to the 6 train, the subway line Lopez used to travel to and from her Castle  Hill home in the Bronx before she hit it big. Titling her debut album after  a New York City subway line is evidence that this beautiful diva hasn't  forgotten from where she came, and the songs on the album are further proof  that Lopez's heart and soul lies in the music she heard and the urban 80s  subculture she experienced growing up in the Bronx. The 14-track set opens  with the aforementioned &quot;If You Had My Love,&quot; a mid-tempo R&amp;B  track that bears the same sass and vocal inflection as early Vanessa  Williams material, and continues with the Tone and Poke-produced  &quot;Should've Never,&quot; a heartwarming ballad, co-written by Lopez  herself, destined to be this year's &quot;Secret Lovers.&quot; Strafe's 80s  classic &quot;Set It Off&quot; is sampled heavily on the booming  &quot;Feelin' So Good,&quot; a fierce hip-hop track with rap cameos by  Lopez's Bronx homies Big Pun and Fat Joe. &quot;No Me Ames,&quot; the  scorching duet with former freestyler and current salsa sensation Marc  Anthony, appears twice, once as a Tropical salsa number, and again as a  sentimental slow jam. And while many of the tracks feature beautiful Latin  rhythms, it is &quot;No Me Ames,&quot; and the Emilio Estefan-produced  &quot;Let's Get Loud,&quot; that are true homages to Lopez's Puerto Rican  heritage. The latter is a pure dancefloor track and its infectious,  energetic beats are likely to be compared to the music of the oh-so-hot  Ricky Martin. &quot;Waiting For Tonight&quot; and &quot;Una Noche Mas&quot;  are anthemic house productions set to move even the biggest wallflower to  the dancefloor.  The former's tale is of a woman's &quot;first time&quot;  with a long-time crush and Lopez wraps her vocals around the slick musical  production with the finesse of a veteran.  While &quot;Waiting For  Tonight&quot; has a classic house feel with a hint of freestyle, a la  Seduction [remember them?], &quot;Una Noche Mas&quot; is a true Latin house  number that has instant hit written all over it. The fourteen songs on  &quot;On The 6,&quot; with production credits going to Sean  &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs, Ric Wake, the Track Masters and Corey Rooney,  along with the previously mentioned Jerkins and Estefan, have obviously  been hand-picked by Lopez as they appear to truly represent who she is as a  Latina, as an actress, as a dancer, and most recently as a singer. Overall,  the album is a fierce mix of lush ballads, foot-stomping dance numbers, and  hands-in-the-air hip-hop tracks, that will make any ride on the iron horse  more enjoyable. Don't sit on this one, whip out the old name belt and webo  boots and hit the dancefloor. Arriba, mi hermana del Bronx.
0375707972|4.0|Some things in life are just inexplicable.  In a rational world, we spew forth words to express meaning, as though we really &quot;know&quot; something.  In The Reader, we are faced with a story where the familiar is  just a facade; like a building in war torn Germany.  Underneath that facade  there is a 15-year old boy trying to be a man.  There is a 36-year old  woman trying survive in literate world with an inability to read.  There is  a mother and daughter deserving justice, who never find it, even when their  perpetrator sentenced in a court of law and dies in prison.  There are  silent victims who speak loudly from the grave, but are only faintly heard.   Most inexplicable,  is human compassion, where one can love even heineous  war criminal, yet not &quot;know&quot; them for who they truly are.
0812550706|5.0|In the Sci-Fi world there is a ponderous amount of un-interesting writing, and most readers spend their time searching for those books that really mean something to the reader.  And a review like this one can't ever be  perfectly accurate because every person out there contains different  opinions on likes and dislikes.  Even though, this book meant so much to me  that I was drawn to my computer to tell you what I think about it.  Despite  the fact that almost every sci-fi book jockey has already read Ender's  Game, I still belive that my review will prove itself interesting to all  audiences.  Sometimes reading what you subconsciously fealt about a book  can bring you to a state of realization concerning your own feelings.       This is a book about a genius boy named Ender that is breed to help humans  against a hostile alien race called the buggars in war.  He is taken from  his home to a training camp in space for the majority of his preparation.   There he learns battle tactics for no gravity environment battle.  Card  does an excellent job of creating real battle tactics for this specific  situation.  I was amazed.  Then Ender is sent to a different place to train  for flight comat where he is put to the test.      There are many factors  that contribute to making this book enjoyable to the reader.  Especially  when you get past the obvious displays of Card's creativity like the plot,  and the uniquely shaped charecters and cause and effect of the charecter  relationships.  The things that make this book really special are the  fellings that it gives the reader.  After all, a sci-fi story can have all  the greatest aspects of a book, but will not be read and rembered if it  isn't enjoyable to the reader.  When I read this novel I truly felt many of  the same emotions that Ender did.  It wasn't strictly observe for me, it  was participate.  Why, you ask, is this book one of the few special ones  that does this.  Well I believe first because of the way he makeshis  charecters so realistic.  Card shows how they feel by using his  intelligence to write about the subconscious and conscious reactions to  another charecter.  He gives sensible, rational psychological sequences  explaining the long and short term effects of an action.      Second, Card  knows how to create a story that will surely have the reader thinking of  the dilemmas and situations of the hero in his/her off-time.  This is  partly because of his ability to get the reader to relate to Ender as he  quests to save humans against the buggars, and also because the plot is  interesting at any point in the book.  Always leaving you somthing to think  about as you put the book down. It also makes the reading experience more  fun because of the suspense built up in the off-time.      Lastly, Card's  excellent vocabulay and smooth writing style in this book make it as easy  as watching a movie.  Fun for anybody.
630438551X|5.0|Though the text is chopped considerably, after spending time trying to teach a group of high school students about scansion and other aspects of Shakespearen text with very little enthusiastic responses, I have  difficutly criticizing this film which suddenly excited and moved the same  students about the same story.  It is a Romeo and Juliet for the nineties  and it succeeds because it goes all the way in making its choices.   Luhrmann manages to get the point of the play across while making the play  accessible to a modern audience.  For instance, shifting the strong  homosocial bond between Romeo and Mercutio to a homosexual crush of  Mercutio on Romeo brings the film into the 90's using Mercutio's textual  jealousy of Romeo's relationship with Juliet as its substansiation.  Don't  watch it for a definitive R&amp;J, but watch it to understand what this  story means in a modern, not an historical, context.<br />Brilliant.
B00000IPAX|3.0|I love the whole album.  I think it's great.  The one flaw is also the reason I gave this album 3 stars.  What happened to the fast punk beat?  Did they forget how to do it?  I think Tom and Mark are really trying to  make more money than to stay true to their original sound.  There's only a  couple songs on the CD that have the fast beat, but none of them keep it up  through the whole song.  They've gotten really good, and their drummer is  amazing.  Check out the drum roll on Going Away To College.  Unfortunatly,  Blink has gone a little to MTV.  I look forward to their next effort.  I  have a feeling it'll be a lot faster and more energetic after all the flak  they'll get from this album, kinda like NOFX's Heavy Petting Zoo.  This  album really reminds me of MXPX's Slowly Going The Way Of The Buffalo.   More radio friendly than punk.  Blink's not my favorite anymore, but they  are still up there.
6304145217|3.0|There's no denying the beauty of this film.  The power of the story is definitely here.  However, the problem with the film, is that Zeffirelli often ignores the text in order to do something that fits his own  interprettation of the story.  For instance, the balcony scene in this film  allows Romeo to climb a tree so that he and Juliet can embrace and fall all  over each other for the whole scene.  The problem with this is that  Shakespeare's text indicates that the two are separated for the whole  scene.  The reason that the lovers talk so much is that they do not have  that physical release.  This is not to say that Zeff.'s choice to put them  together on the balcony is not a valid choice considering the characters  and the historical context.  However, the problem with the film that I have  is that it is often shown in high schools and has become known as the  &quot;definitive&quot; Romeo and Juliet, and that is not so.  For a  defintive version of the text, we will undoubtedly have to look to the RSC.   This version is beautiful, but its young stars are often lost in the text  and Zeff.'s treatment of the text (with such omissions as the death of  Paris and the scene following the discovery of the &quot;dead&quot; Juliet  and such additions as a ten minute sword fight between Romeo and Tybalt for  a fight usually written in the text as simply, &quot;They fight.  Tybalt  falls&quot;) is often to serve his own purposes more than Shakespeare's.
6305127689|5.0|For us older folks, Tom Cruise looks like a kid in this movie. A big casting mistake with Cruise and McGillis as love birds - no chemistry here. A better than average video transfer but the audio is so-so. The action  sequences speak for themselves and made this movie a real show stopper. I  really liked the rivalry between Cruise and Kilmer for the Top Gun trophy.  Once again, Paramount has taken a diamond and turned it into a lump of  coal. No extras, irritating menus and no printed info to speak of. Still,  if you like this movie, the DVD is a lot better than VHS any way you cut  it.
6305263248|4.0|The main charcters in the movie are not supposed to be heroes, as the reviwer from Australia writes. Despite the fact that one is a CIA agent (I won't say who), the recovery of the contents of the briefcase outweigh any  civilian loses. In addition, the people who are responsible for the deaths  (The ones who shoot in crowds, and drive the cras) are the mercenary  characters, not the goverment agents. I love movies where the main  characters are NOT heroes...it gives movies much more new emotions and  actions to explore. <br />Ronin is a fine Friday night movie.

079073804X|5.0|I've seen &quot;The Exorcist&quot; at least 50 times, and it disturbs me in different ways as I get older. When I was young, it was the effects and the shocks. But now it is the more subtle things - that incredibly sinister  prologue for one. <br />The most upsetting thing for me now, having lost my  mother to Alzheimer's disease, is the subplot about FrKarras' guilt over  his mother. When the demon says &quot;You killed your mother, you left her  to die&quot;, I had to stop watching for a while. That is truly great film  making  - it gets you right where you live.
6305313687|5.0|Chillingly realistic. Insight into the mind of what troubles America today. It isn't pretty. It is graphic and intense which keeps the tone of the move through out this amazing movie. Racisim today is a glossed over  problem because it does not directly effect most Americans today. We don't  see it so it must not be there.  This movie made me think a lot of how I  look at  and treat other people. That is what we should ask of movies  today. Not only do we need mindless entertainmet but we sometimes need to  have our eyes opened up and see what really goes on around us. Truely  gripping and compelling. The use of black and white flash backs was quite  interesting. Well acted and the direction is great. Ed Norton is amazing. A  gifted actor. Looking for good things from him in the future. A very well  crafted movie. A real must see.
0684800713|4.0|Hemingway makes you want to call up a bunch of buddies and hit sidewalk cafe after cafe ordering good food and drink.  He makes these things seem like true life pleasures in the way he describes them.  I can't say I did  not like the book.  There is no real plot, but the adventure Hemingway  takes you on makes up for it.  I disliked most of the characters which  simply means that Hemingway did a great job making them real.  Brett Ashley  is the most despicable character I've ever read about.  Her manipulation  and mind games are painted so well by Hemingway that you want her to be  real so you can tell her off.  She really angered me.  All this means is  that if a character in a book can anger you, than the author has done his  job making the character come to life.  It took me awhile to come to terms  that I liked this book.  I first thought I hated it.  When I saw myself  constantly talking about the characters to friends, I realized that I  really liked the book. I would suggest that it be read by everyone who  wants to be wisked away to Spain during the running of the bulls, see a  bull fight, and be taken to sidewalk cafes to drink and be merry.  Great  book! Short read. Read it!
1573226521|5.0|Thank you Alex Garland for sharing your imagination, dreams, visions, believes and fears with us. Thank you for describing the most beautiful and darkest aspects of humanity. Thank you sincerely for writing this book.
B00000J2KX|5.0|The Shining,although it's different from Stephen King's Book, is a very good movie.  But I think they should of had Jack take longer to go crazy and start with little subtle things Wendy starts to notice before he 'comes  out' as a madman.  And I think it should have had a 'prologue' scene with  the two girls and the mother getting shased around and killed by that first  caretaker.  It would be nice if they could somehow add a scene with the  hedge animals and the hotel expoloding(which is what happened in the book),  but its been too long since the original version and all the actors are too  old now.  And it wouldn't be the ame without Kubrick.  The remake does have  the hedge animals and the hotel exploding, but it has crappy acting and a  real sorry ending where the dad's ghost appears at Danny's graduation.  But  the original is the one I'm grading, and it is really good. Shelly Duvall  is great as Wendy with her screams and frantic running around.  Jak  Nicholson is creepy, and the hotel is SCARY.  FIVE STARS
0385493800|3.0|Mr. Grisham does craft a great story, no doubt.  This story doesn't 'feel' quite like his other novels, but that doesn't make it bad either.  Some great narratives.  I liked the focus on people's priorities and how they  can impact others lives.
B000007T1M|5.0|This band has got to be the most incredible thing since the invention of distortion.  The music on this disc tends to be raw, yet very very tight.  Extremely heavy and hard to dislike, I love the music and the message.   <br />Their live show kicks, also... Just saw them at the Ozzfest, and they  ruled!!!<br />P.S.  Anyone who says Serj is &quot;losing it&quot; because he  thinks the world situation is screwed up needs a serious reality check  themselves.
6300183971|4.0|Dune was a great book, a classic. The movie, one the other hand is hard to follow-- very much so if you havent read the novel. The cast was-- for the most part, B- rate. The speacial effects were-- what can I say? 1980's. The  sand worms were cool. The music, some good songs (Main theme), some bad  songs. I think my review was effected by my reading of the fasinating book.
B000002TQV|5.0|This is such an outstanding album I just want to listen to it over and over again. There's so much passion and feeling in the lyrics and the way they are sung. Certainly an album of the Nineties. You never tire of this,  how anyone could class it as Britpop I don't know because it's just so much  more than that. Definately an all time favourite!!
6301697707|1.0|Not one other reviewer has metioned Dune. They cannot be blamed for thier ignorance; Dune is not a well known movie. It (Dune) was made in 1984, five years before Tremors--a horrible movie, that proves Dune is not a rip-off  of Tremors. The book Dune--a great sci-fi novel was written over twenty  years before Tremors was produced. I think Tremors is the epitome of  &quot;Cool-dude&quot; movies. I liked the movie; it was  entertaining--that's what I thought six years ago when I was seven. I can't  stress this enough, it was just a horrible movie. A C- rate cast, crapy  music, no plot what so ever. If you agree with me please E-mail me.
B00000IBRX|5.0|this is the most beautifully shot and written movie ever. the creativity displayed in this movie is spellbounding. how this movie did not get best picture is beyound me. Williams is at his very best.
0385493800|2.0|This was the most boring book written by John Girsham that I have ever read and I have read all of his books.  I skipped most of the pages wehre character Nate was in the jungle.  I could have done without all of that  description.  I hated the ending.  Without giving the ending away, I  thought the settlement was unfair.<br />I have read everyone of John Girsham's  books and was inspired to complete law school.  I was disappointed to read  The Testament.  It was nothing like the rest of his books.
B000001E7V|5.0|By far trickys best album it seemed to just capture a lot of emotion and meaning.  I cant wait till his next album is released. If you only could get one tricky album get maxinquaye!!!!!!!
6304109318|4.0|I saw this movie two days ago and I can't stop thinking about it!  I have seen John Malkovich in several other movies, but after watching this one I had to learn more about him.  Both of the personalities he played were very  sexy.  The only downfall of the movie was Julia Roberts fake Irish accent.   Sometimes it would be too strong, and other times it was practically  non-existent.  Either way, it was a great movie!!  The effects at the end  were pretty cool too.
1573226521|4.0|This reads like a lonely planet guide to utopia, via joseph conrad's heart of darkness. it has the twists, bells and whistles of great adventure writing, the pop culture in-jokes, crisp dialogue, coming-of-age undertones   and true narrative ease. maybe some of the mysterious characters needed  more background (what's the story with mr duck anyway?), but neither that,  nor the occasionally dull dream foreshadowing sequence (a couple too many  there if you ask me) prevents this from being a standout read, especially  for (you guessed it) would-be travellers and backpackers. couch potatoes  please refrain.
B000002VTE|4.0|If you want spacey, dreamy music, stick with this. Those of you who do not know who &quot;Spiritualized&quot; is (ie. the guy who says to stick with MBV), should definatley check this out. Jason Pierce was a member of the  wildly experimental and critically acclaimed &quot;Spacemen 3&quot;. Who  were aroungd way back in 85, before MBV had honed in on their shoegazer  sound. But don't get confused by the comments below. Spiritualized is very  different from MBV. To this day, i cannot figure out why Spiritualized is  always compared to MBV. It doens't make any sense to me. Spiritualized to  me, should get equally as much praise as mbv does. I guarantee you,  Spacemen 3 had something to do with the way MBV sounds, and vice versa.  This is a great album. Not their strongest, but definately great. And hey,  at least they're releasing stuff. The same cannot be said about MBV who's  last full length was released in 91. Spiritualized is a Symphony in space.  Those of you who don't like this music, that's too bad, cuz it really is  great music. Sure, you wouldn't put it on at a Canadian BBQ, save that for  Sloan.
B00000AOUD|5.0|I have been a fan of Jethro Tull for only a year and have enjoyed every bit of it.  I first bought &quot;Original Masters&quot; and was blown away.  A second album was in order.  Thick as a Brick didn't let me down.  No  matter what mood you are in there is a part of the song that you can groove  to.  As others have said the first time listening to the song the whole  picture it takes a couple times to really grasp the music.
B000002WYT|1.0|What is this garbage? This is perfect for those &quot;psuedo-intellectual&quot; college students who look forward to the weekend so they can go to their cheap dance clubs in hopes of finding  someone whom they can take home and sleep with. There is no emotion in this  music at all. It is simply a cheap, rehashed, corney derivitive of the oh  so boring and corney early 90s Pearl Jam era. Everyone i have ever known to  like this music spends most of their time drinking Molson canadian and  talking about their new Ski-doo they just dropped 6 g's on. Thank you Dave  Matthews for bringing the world of idiots together. as for the music? Dave  Matthews is one of the worst singers i have ever heard. The music is simple  and cheap. If i hear one more Ovation acoustic guitar being played on the  9th fret i'm gonna scream. This music makes me angry. With the hundreds of  great indie bands out their busting their buts, this makes it thru????? can  someone please explain this to me.
B00004S8Q9|5.0|In London, 30 November 1991, I watched Badlands play in support of their Voodoo Highway album. They played two new songs that night, Tribal Moon and  Fire Lasts Forever: the former I was totally blown away by and the latter  had such a cool bluesy groove... I've waited almost eight years to hear  them again and am so grateful to have had this opportunity. Five stars,  without question.   Seven months later I met the band after a gig which  would be the last batch of dates they ever played and I had asked about  Tribal Moon which they did not play on this particular tour, Jake shrugged  and pointed to a set-list in my hand telling me a title called The River  was his favourite song of theirs and one can hear why. Amazing.    It is  such a crime that material that is so consistently strong as theirs should  remain largely unknown today. I can't think of any band from the last 20  years which can match the earthiness of Badlands and their blues-laden hard  rock. In my opinion Voodoo Highway is the best album of our time and fans  of such should waste no time in ordering Dusk, too.    A fitting closure,  save for a live set - please!
B000002HAJ|5.0|My wife asked me yesterday for my top 7 albums that I would take to a desert island.  Much to my amazement this album came third in the list - even though I hadn't played it for a while.  Playing it non-stop since then  reminds me how these wonderful songs lift the spirit and make me feel GOOD  (+ I am no big Cure fan).  &quot;Doing the Unstuck&quot; must be the  ultimate in &quot;self improvement/life change&quot; songs whereas the rest  of the songs take you on an emotional and romantic journey not expected of  the Cure.  I will surely pack it in along with the other six...
0374172897|4.0|inia Wolff and places her dilemma in the context of two contemporary women.  One woman, begins her stuggle for identity at the end of World War II.  She would rather read the novel Mrs. Dalloway, than participate in  family life.  Reluctantly she goes the motions of preparing a cake with her  small son for her husband's birthday.  She cannot bring about the emotional  commitment to this kind of living.<br />The second contemporary woman,  Clarissa, is nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway, and she relives the opening scene of  that novel.  She, too , struggles with a meaning to her life and finds it  lacking.  Her realationships are all frought with her self-imposed fears  and disappointments.  <br />And then, there is Virginia Wolff herself,  struggling with the beginning of the novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;   <br />All three characters weave in and out of this tale of psychological  hell, and the ending is a grand epiphany which brings the characters  together.<br />I have a minor criticism.  The author writes about a flower  shop in June and describes its contents. HOwever, paperwhites are not  available at that time of year.  They are finished the the first week of  May.
B000002U8G|5.0|A real treat for any lovers of Dark Side to step back and hear the first seeds of that magical music.  One of my seven desert island discs (the only Floyd) which takes me through so many moods, memories and ambiances that it  would keep me company for years.  Consistently brilliant, approachable and  listenable.
0802130208|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud over and over again in many public places.  Poor, pathetic Ignatius- so misunderstood by the public at large.  Haven't we all been there at one time, or every day?  I think the book  itself is also misunderstood by the general populace.  As for the people  who don't get it, we on the other team know your type and could tell if  you'd get it or not before you even picked up the book. Just kidding (a  little)!  I think John Ritter's character in Slingblade is carrying the  paperback edition of this book in a brief scene.  He answers the front door  or something and I really think he's holding this book.  Everyone should  read this book- if you hate it that means something.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|I like Jennifer Lopez and always have, hey, she's from the Bronx, took the 6 train, and she's boricua(Nuyorican), (Just like me).  But just because of this doesn't mean I'll support her voice.  There's just one word for her  singing skills:HORRIBLE!!  Jennifer please, you're a good actress, and you  can dance, but you just can't sing.  The only good song on her cd is  &quot;NO ME AMES&quot;.  And that's because Marc Anthony is in it: Now  that's a talented man.  His voice is beautiful and truly passionate.  My  advice?  Buy all 3 of his cd's plus the English one coming out in August.   He's worth it. For what I see, once you're in the industry you have a much  greater chance of moving professions, but no matter how many connections  you have, voices like Jennifer Lopez' should not be heard over the radio.   La India, Olga Tanon, Celia Cruz, Gloria Estefan, and Ednita Nazario now  those are truly talented women. Jennifer's just a wanna be.
B000002UAX|5.0|&quot;The Beatles&quot; is one of rock's most durable achievements. I think some critics of the album miss the point of double albums, which is not to sit down and listen to the whole thing start to finish (though it  can be done), or to sit around thinking &quot;gee, I wish this only had my  favorite songs on it&quot;, but to take each side or song on its own for  what it is, lest it get lost in the shuffle of the sprawling whole. It's  sort of like a library - an overwhelming wellspring of material to fill the  senses. The variety here is so great that there are bound to be some songs  you prefer over others, depending on your taste. But look closely at each  song and you start to realize the depth of the achievement. I mean, my God  these songs, these productions, so many, so various, such melodies, such  overall quality. Take a forgotten song like &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot; for  example. The composition of that piano riff and the performance of the lead  vocal are masterful. And that's just this one song, never mind the genius  surrealism of &quot;Happiness is A Warm Gun&quot;, the tragic emotion of  &quot;Julia&quot;, the jazzy harpsichord of &quot;Piggies,&quot; the  outright fun of &quot;Honey Pie,&quot; the stinging lyric of  &quot;Revolution&quot; and the tight, soaring rock of &quot;Birthday&quot;  and &quot;Everybody's Got Something to Hide...&quot; etc. etc. ETC. Any one  of these songs would have been remarkable for another group, but for the  Beatles they're just ones among many. It's fun, it's witty, it's smart,  it's happy, it's sad, it's moving, and it's great. The Beatles had  something for everybody's taste, and their rate of success in this dazzling  stylistic virtuosity (unknown to most limited groups) takes my breath away.

B00000099Y|5.0|Few bands have ever had the power and intelligence to move people with the passion and creative force of their music as well as teach so effortlessly with their lyrics.  Tracks such as 46&amp;2, Aenima and Third Eye express  their devotion to understanding the collective unconscious as well as  showing the influences of C. Jung and Bill Hicks has had on their music.   No band can challenge Tool for creativity.... the beauty and power of this  album leaves but one question; how can their, or anyone elses', next album  be any better?
0064400018|5.0|This book is the first in the noted \\"Little House\\" series of autobiographical books for children by Laura Ingalls Wilder (1867-1957), daughter of Charles (1836-1902) and Caroline Ingalls (1839-1924) and sister  to Mary (1865-1928) and Carrie (Caroline; 1870-1946). This first book takes  place in the log cabin and farm in the woods a few miles from the small  town of Pepin, Wisconsin, in 1871-1872. Through the eyes of a little girl,  a real glimpse of frontier life is provided (we later discover that each  book becomes more organized and developed, as if mirroring the growth of  Laura Ingalls). The book is filled with descriptions of how settlers had to  provide for themselves and how they still had time to sing and enjoy their  lives. The Wilder series also points out how much women contributed in the  frontier. These stories point out the frontier and restless spirit and  character of a typical fronteir pioneer as well as the work ethic and  patience of men and women who have to get all they need from nature. The  series is considered one of the classics in children's literature. Every  serious student of children literature should have a copy on their shelves.  In addition, as mentioned above, the text is a great sourcebook for 19th  century food, traditions, games, and songs that were common in a frontier  home.
0780625129|5.0|Roberto Benigni might have been humorous, but Edward Norton is the actor that truly deserved the Oscar.  His wonderful performance ranges everywhere from frightening to compassionate, disturbing to emotional.   &quot;AHX&quot; is the most shocking, moving, and simply amazing movie to  come out of Hollywood since the Best-Picture-deserving &quot;Saving Private  Ryan&quot; of last summer.  Yes, the language and motivations of the  characters will shock all who watch, but this movie will undoubtedly stay  with everyone who watches it.
068484267X|5.0|Touching.  I know it sounds trite, but this book made me appreciate how lucky I really am. On literary style, I am an eclectic reader, but tend to judge biographies by how closely they approximate fiction in terms of plot  and character development.  Angela's Ashes definitely passed the test -- it  read like a well-developed novel.  Also, I sensed that McCourt tried to  distance himself somewhat from his own feelings about his family members to  present a less partial view, though he was not always successful in this  regard.<br />I am definitely looking forward to his next work.
B000002UUX|5.0|Without a doubt their heaviest, and best. They will never rock like this again, so do yourself a favor and get this now. Every song is a highlight, all are tight, fast and just plain heavy.
014028009X|5.0|A quick read (you won't want to put it down) that was laugh-out-loud funny and embarrasingly true-to-life. Fielding captures the pitfalls of career, love life, getting ready for work in the morning, maintaining one's  self-esteem, etc.  So far, I have recommended this book to my husband, my  mother, and my mother-in-law, not to mention my friends.
B000002L7V|4.0|This is an underappreciated album. Sacred Heart continues the legacy of the first two solo albums, however, it has a somewhat more accessible vibe going through it. I saw them on this tour and they rocked.
6302719631|2.0|Very disappointed in this film.  The movie spent too much time on the fanticy portions of the book than the reality.  Got lost a few times.  There was much more charater interaction in the book as well as other  adapted films of Jane Austin's books than this movie.  The acting was fair  but as one charater in P &amp; P said, &quot;Her teeeth are tolerable, but  not out of the common wasy.&quot;  Next time I won't read the book first  before I get the movie.  Then I won't be disappointed.  Not up to Jane  Austin enthusiasts' standards.

0805017305|5.0|Although this book only focuses on the latter 1800's and early 1900's of American Indian History, the numerous accounts of disgraceful, genocidal acts by the American people against the original inhabitants of this land  brought continuous tears and sorrow to my heart.  For my heart is now  buried at Wounded Knee and Sands Creek.  No person born or naturalized as a  U.S. citizen should lay down and die without reading this awesome account  of American History.

0141301066|5.0|The book Matilda has the characters Matilda, her brother, her mother, her father, Mrs. Honey, Mrs. Trunchbull, Lavender, and Amanda.  Matilda is the main character. Her parents took her as a mistake. They didn't like her at  all. In fact when they got home from the hospital, they forgot her in the  car. But Matilda is very smart. She learned how to take care of herself  when she was about 4 - 6 the way that people would take care of themselves  in their early 30's. In the morning her parents would go off to work and  leave her nothing but cold uncooked soup on the stove. She would dump that  and make herself pancakes. Then she would take the long trip to the library  to read some books. Her parents had miserable jobs. Her father sold cheap  old cars that weren't worth what he charged them. Her mother went off and  played bingo.   Matilda's father finally sent her to school. The  principal at the school was very mean. She put children in a closet called  the chokei and there were nails sticking in it and she locked it so they  couldn't get out. Since her parents were very mean to her at the end  Matilda's teacher Mrs. Honey adopted her. They both lived very happily for  the rest of their life's.  This book takes place in the present and  most events occur when Matilda is in school. She acquires almost the entire  school as her friends, even the older kids. When she was in school Mrs.  Trunchbull made a boy called Bruce Bogtrotter eat a whole cake in front of  an assembly of kids. Matilda cheered him on the whole time. along with  everyone else.  All together this book is a very good book,. and very,  very exciting.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I was anxious to buy &quot;Enema of the State&quot;, and was not disappointed. Blink continues to create catchy and amusing songs which celebrate immaturity and eternal sophomorism. I loved &quot;Dude  Ranch,&quot; but I like this CD even better. I think this will be their  breakthrough album.
B0000027RL|5.0|This album is heaven sent in my humble opinion.  As a human being in touch with the dark sides of both myself and life, I feel so much from this album.  &quot;Black&quot; details the emotions caused by love lost... or  perhaps love not even once had?  &quot;Why Go?&quot; chronicles yet another  powerful emotion -- rejection.  As a priest, I have found many of these  songs to be a comfort to my congregation.  Compared to my clergy peers, I  am a young man, but still I feel that anyone who listens with a truly  honest soul will benefit from this album.  If you don't own it, but it,  please.  I ask you this for the good of your emotional and spiritual  well-being.  Godspeed to you all.  Blessed be the children who understand  the ways of the world, and thank you Pearl Jam.
B000002G26|4.0|Bryan Adams puts together a solid collection of his hits here.  This album proves that Adams is more of a singles star, rather than an album star.  There are many noteworthy songs here, including &quot;Summer of '69,&quot;  &quot;Heaven,&quot; and &quot;It's Only Love.&quot;  The one problem that  lies in this album is that Adams was partly responsible for the  &quot;formula&quot; power ballad that evolved throughout the eighties, and  this album reminds us of that.  However, the collection does manage to mix  the songs up so that  the ballads are not successive.  He does have a  distinct sound to his music (and voice), something that is definitely  lacking in today's music.  The songs are all memorable, though they do not  delve into anything beyond what is considered standard pop music.  Overall,  a good album by a good artist, who though never made a huge dent in pop  music, did manage to make a nice ding.
6305165912|5.0|The distillation of this films essence: Dude driving the last of what appears to be 150 or so (bent) nails into the section of 2x4 in front of his door, wedging the chair in place under the doorknob, and then turning  to walk halfway across the room when the door opens. Outward. The chair  crashes to the floor and the goons stroll right in. The absolute futility  of anything he has ever tried to do to actively effect his life is laid  bare in that moment. And it's funny as hell. Now I'll just &quot;shut the  f*** up, Donny.&quot;

B00000J6AG|4.0|Another unbelievably brilliant album from techno's self-professed Little Idiot. Much is being made about Moby's sampling of old-time R&amp;B and folk recordings on this record; sure, they're fantastic pieces of work (and  for me personally the most fulfilling-- &quot;Run On&quot; is just SO damn  catchy), but if you're some kind of bizarre techno-purist then you've got  plenty to go on with PLAY, from the fast-paced cascade of  &quot;Machete&quot; to the sprawling electro-rock  brothers-gonna-work-it-out fable &quot;South Side&quot;. I sound like some  kind of propaganda machine, but heck, maybe I am; God knows this album  deserves promoting. Listen and buy.

078401213X|5.0|The high contrast B&amp;W and the bizarre hallucinations certainly reminded me of &quot;Crazy Dave&quot; Lynch's masterpiece, except this has a somewhat understandable plot.

No, it's worse than my worst nightmare.   Only knowing in advance that Simpson survived the ordeal was I able to set  aside my fears and pick up the book in the first place; once I started  readingI couldn't put it down.  If you're a climber, you'll love it.  If  you relish incredible tales of human survival, you'll love it.  If you want  to feel lucky you're alive, you'll love it.  I did.

0780623134|5.0|Very few movies have portrayed a story the way 'The Shawshank Redemption' has.  From the development of characters to the script itself, this film is an A+ in every aspect. The film exceeds two hours, but the viewer can not  tell the difference.  I was engulfed in the magic of the film and its  exceptional creativity.  This film is a 'must see' for all.
6304613199|1.0|Any yokel who lauds &quot;Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; as a triumph for Steven Spielberg &amp; Michael Crichton needs some sense desperately knocked into his/her head!  Like the rest of the lobotomized Generation X,  I saw this film over its 1997 Memorial Day weekend debut with naive  high-hopes.  In hindsight, all I can say is that I'm thankful that my folks  coughed-up for the tickets and not my hard-earned money!  &quot;Lost  World&quot; ranks as low as &quot;1941&quot; and &quot;Twilight Zone: The  Movie&quot; as among Spielberg's few forgettable worst.  With the  international success that the original film found in 1993, I'm reminded of  the popular adage &quot;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; when it comes  down to &quot;Lost World&quot;.  You definitely aren't missing much (unless  you are teenage girl who lusts for Vince Vaughn) and probably won't when  &quot;Jurassic Park 3&quot; comes out if you are one of the fortunate few  who hasn't seen this avaricious Spielberg sequel!

0380973464|5.0|I was a bit put off by the comparisons to Pynchon, and can report that they are wrong. Stephenson is better than Pynchon, and this is a better book than Gravity's Rainbow.  It kept me reading when I should have been  doing other things, and its worldview is still percolating through my  brain.  Buy it, read it, but set aside the necessary time!
0802130208|5.0|This book is all 10 on the list of my top ten favorites.  There is nothing I can really add to all the adulation it has received - but I do think that the personal attacks on the people who 'don't get it' are uncalled for.  This book, besides being very funny, touches the reader very deeply  psychologically in a manner that I relate to but that others might find  completely foriegn.<br />My real reason for adding my voice is to let readers  know that I have recently read another book whose protaganist is very  reminicient of Ignatius.  The book, Nevermore by Harold Schechter, is a  mystery pairing Edgar Allan Poe and Davy Crockett who pool their very  different talents to solve a mystery.  As implausible as this seems,  somehow it works.  <br />Poe (the teller of the tale) is a skinny, bibulous  Ignatius and some of his conversations with his aunt could have come  straight from Comfederacy. Poe could match vocabulary with Ignatius word  for word and even possibly come out on top.  It is a real challange to see  how often you are forced to reach for the dictionary of the obscure.  Davy  Crockett is quoted as using my very favorite obscure word: absquatulate,  which means, as far as I can remember, to leave hurriedly in order to avoid  apprehension - literally to go off and squat elsewhere.  Not only does the  author use the word, which I have never seen ANYWHERE, he has Davy  misprounce it as 'absquottleated.'  Oh, I think I'm in love.<br />In short, if  you love Confederacy I think you will enjoy this book also.
B000002J09|5.0|There is no band that can even come close to being as good as Zeppelin.  There is no better guuitarist than Page, no better drummer than Bonzo, no better Bassist than JPJ, and no better singer than Plant, and this is the  best LP they ever did, but if you want Kick yo' a$$ good, then get BBC  sessions, even though it doesnt have Battle of Evermore and Levee Breaks,  or Four sticks, it still Kics some major butt, its LIVE, kinda.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|I recently read an article that said Mariah Carey was part Latino.............and if this is true......she ain't got nothing on Jennifer.  Not only can Jennifer sing, but she can dance and act as well.   She is the bomb and I hope her album goes on to sell a bazillion copies  because she is out there representin for the Latinos and the ladies as  well..........she is so &quot;Fly&quot;..........and I wish her much  success and happiness and I hope you come out with another video soon  because &quot;If You Had My Love&quot; just ain't enough to satisfy  me!!!!!!

B00000J7RZ|5.0|I think she has one of the best female vocals, and she is hot. I would recommend this cd to everyone out there.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|All in all I give Jennifer her props.  She is a diva and has just taken it into a whole new genre.  Although her voice is not dynamic, it is very suitable and capable to the material she has chosen to sing.  She shines at  her best on songs such as &quot;If You Had My Love&quot;, &quot;Let's Get  Loud&quot; and &quot;Feelin' So Good&quot;.  It is a very strong debut CD  with stellar producers.  Kudos to Ms. Lopez for proving that she can do it  all and do it well. Move over young wannabe starlets, Miss Lopez is on the  scene and she is ready to stake her grounds.
6303022901|5.0|Missed this when it was originally released, but finally saw it on a French movie channel this week. and ordered it immediately.  A beautiful film. Superlative in every respect.
6301967984|5.0|It is not surprising that this film appeared in 1970s. While those years seem so far away, they were much more progressive in many regards than 1990s and with no doubt an intellectually- vibrant period. In his books,  Michel Foucault unravels the intricate relationships among power, sex, body  and establishment. IMHO, Pasolini's Salo is an extreme dramatization of  this web. A must-see for literature, humanities and critical theory  students!
6301773551|5.0|Star Wars indeed deserves all five stars.  The movie represents a mixture of eastern and western elements to produce a somewhat unique philosophy. Space just happens to be the setting for this epic film.  In terms of the  special effects, Star Wars is the exception to the rule; in these films,  the special effects serve to flesh out the plot.  Star Wars is one of the  few movies which is heavily laden with special effects and yet isn't just a  special effects movie.
B000002G6J|5.0|I heard the music or Antonio Carlos Jobim in the 1960s, but I never heard his 1967 classic bossa nova elpee WAVE until WPAT of Patterson, New Jersey played the title cut in 1990, when I lived there.   Innovative in its use  of trombone, and string bass, &quot;Wave&quot; climaxed the bossa nova era  as no other recording that I have heard from its twighlight years.   Furthermore, the coolness of it makes it a compliment to jazz and any other  category of pop instrumental then or now.  &quot;The Red Dress&quot; is a  piece over five minutes in length.  Jobim demostrates his skill in longer  numbers (which were becoming vogue in 1967) with sparkling touches of  piano, soothing flutes, and orchestration that might weaken other  &quot;easy listening&quot; compositions, Jobim transcends the label of  &quot;middle of the road&quot; and ascends into the category of pop  standard.  Indeed, in the 1990s the title cut, WAVE, has been re-rcorded by  rock instrumental combo Satan's Pilgrim's who, dispite their name, do a  admirable job of it.<br />By 1967 bossa nova had much faded in Brazil since  the coming of its military government and was being superceded by Tropical.   More political, and short lived, Troptical is at least hinted at by the  choice ot cover artwork.<br />Recorded in Los Angeles during the spring,  Jobim, after being taken to see the Mojave Desert, composed the opening cut  on side 2 which he entitles: Mojave.  <br />It's smooth flute, and bass driven  melody that is soft, yet like a graceful whale in the ocean moves with easy  unlabored power.<br />The one vocal, &quot;Lamento&quot;, has the  characteristic bossa nova treatment called &quot;the soft voice&quot;.   <br />It is a pop masterpiece that leaves one wishing that there was more.   Fortunately for us Antonio Carlos Jobim made many more recordings.<br />Of all  his solo efforts in the 1960's, WAVE stands as the multi-imparvo, the acme  of bossa nova from the man who helped, with Joao Gilberto and LuisBonfa,  to bring bossa nova to the world.
B00000ILDE|5.0|The second of four &quot;ALIEN&quot; movies by far outshines all other &quot;ALIEN&quot; movies.  From the beginning, this movie grabs you, pulls you in, and never allows you to get bored or think about a bathroom break.   The acting is GREAT.  The Special Effects are incredible. A MUST SEE for  any Sci-Fi Fan.
B000002N3N|4.0|&quot;On My Way Home&quot; is playing on my CD-ROM player as I'm typing this.  Overall, this is an excellent album.

630529142X|5.0|I thought that this movie was the best.  I wish that I could play football like that.  It has a great plot and is reall funny.  Most of the time, comedy's don't make me laugh that much, but this one was different.
6300214753|5.0|This movie is one of the all time classics that seems to transcend itself. It is the funniest, most enjoyable, most vicariously inspiring movie of all time. Seriously though, I've seen it 27 times and it's still as good as the  first time I saw it. If you die without seeing this movie you should be  placed in a burlap sack and beaten with reeds....although it wouldn't do a  lot of good if you're dead, right?
B000002J1F|5.0|Like I was saying, yes! This is the greatest prog-rock album of all time, and whoever doesn't like it obviously needs to give it another listen. YES!!!
B00000IQMT|5.0|This CD has everything!  From the orignal star wars theme to the evil theme of Darth Maul.  If you liked the movie, you'll like this!
B000002UJQ|5.0|poetic. the pink floyd of the 90's. incredibly beautiful lyrics
630280082X|5.0|once again you have to see it to believe it this is one of those films that can keep you in you chair for hours make you forget all you problems i loved it from the begining to the end especially the guitar battle at the  end i wish they would put it on dvd so i can listen in digital stereo over  and over without losing sound and picture quality
0790729687|5.0|If people could be turned into vampires, this is how it would be.  Anne Rice is an amazing writer, and even with the parts in the book that didn't show up in the movie, the movie is excellent!
0812550757|5.0|This book is fantastic, I can't say enough about it.  Speaker left you wanting page after page to find out the secrets behind the piggies and just all the residents of Lusitania.  Speaker had much more twists than Ender's  Game considering the only &quot;twist&quot; in EG was the end.  As a  standalone story this is one of the best but compared to Ender's Game and  as a sequel it's only about average.  I don't think it did a tremendous job  as a sequel to be honest.  There was almost no...&quot;continuation&quot;  from Ender's Game.  I personally would have liked to have seen more  Valentine and Jane even though I know they will play larger parts in the  next 2.  Even though it's not a fantastic sequel, read Ender's Game first,  then buy this!
B00000IPAX|5.0|When I first heard that Blink was in the process of recording a new album I was really excited. That was back in January or Feburary so naturally when it finially came out I rushed to get it. I can tell you that I was not  one bit disapointed at all. I have been a fan of these guys from the  begining and I can tell you old or new Blink 182 fans that this is an  awesome recording. If anyone says that they are turning a little pop they  are full of crap. This is just not one bit pop. It's still the same rockin'  great Blink 182 that has impressed us all. To be quite honest I think that  it's their best album they have made yet. Buy this cd right now because you  cannot miss out on this one.
B000002NJS|5.0|madonna has evolved so much over the years and so has her music...this cd shows a new side to madonna, that keeps you wanting more.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I waited forever for this cd and wasn't disapointed when it came out. Add this one to you collection and I promise you will like it.
B00000IQMT|5.0|This soundtrack has restored my faith in John Williams.  I liked the orginal Star Wars soundtracks and the Jurassic Park soundtrack, but I was lukewarm over Saving Private Ryan.  I loved this CD though.  &quot;Duel of  the Fates&quot; is a great song which is even better in the movie.  The  rest of the soundtrack is good too, combining new themes with old.  I  particularly liked the faint &quot;Imperial March&quot; heard over  &quot;Anakin's Theme&quot;.  The CD is short, though, and poorly  orgainized, but I am sure a special edition will be released as they did  with the original trilogy.  I highly recommend this score.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink 182 has worked hard to earn five stars. Their new cd is really great and every song is good. It doesn't have one bad song on it, unlike some other cd's you may buy. They are the greatest band and like I said, I  totally think that they deserve it. Also pick up Dude Ranch, Cheshire Cat,  and Buddha, three other really great albums.
6303168507|5.0|I really don't have much to say about this film, because so much has been said already.  It is a modern classic in the truest sense of the term.  It should be required viewing for all humanity.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD! THESE GUYS ARE SO SEXY AND FINE AND THEY ARE TERRIFIC SINGERS! I THINK THE VIDEOS ARE HILLARIOUS AND I WISH I COULD CRAWL INTO BED WITH THE 2 LEADS!
B00000ILDE|4.0|The good news is the extra 17 minutes is interesting, and fleshes out what happens with the colonists.  The only unfortunate thing is the transfer seems less clear than the one on the previous widescreen VHS version with  the plastic cover.  It's like watching an old movie on tv rather than being  crisp and clear like The Fifth Element or a great DVD.  I gave away my VHS  copy in anticipation of this, unfortunately.  Still it's such a great film  it can be ignored.
6303433766|5.0|From the first scene to the last scroll of words the lives of two young teenagers captivate and mezmerizing you, gluing to your seat. Living in a period of time where acceptance is next to godliness you hope that the  generational gap will transcend into the past to help ailing parents cope  with the love affair between their daugthers. Kate Winslet proves to be  astounding in a lead character with her brazen wit and soft underbelly that  repeatedly is given blows by absent parents. Melanie Lynsky also gives a  poweful performance as a hostile withdrawn morbid character finding solace  not in her mother who is a busy housewife but in her best friend  Juliet(Kate Winslet). The two form a friendship that intercepts boundaries  not accepted or understood in the 1950's. Homeosexuality was unspoken and  considered curable as a mental illness. The two girls reveal in their  &quot;maddness&quot; to a state of homicidal nature when their parents  attempt to seperate them. As a true story, it is bewildering and saddening  to watch two young girls go through adolenscence with no actual grip on  reality as we know it. I recommend this wholeheadrtedly as a wonderful yet,  sorrowful tale of two girls coming of age.
B000002C25|5.0|Take my advice and just ignore all those bad reviews.  This is one of the best cd's I have ever heard.  I can remember listening to it the night I bought it.  I didn't really know what to expect.  But as soon as I heard  the first song, &quot;D'You Know  What I Mean&quot; I instantly fell in  love with it.  Every song was great.  It's pretty rare to find a cd that  you can play from start to finish the first time you pop it into your  stereo.  Oasis is by far the best band around today.  And please quit  trying to compare them to the Beatles.  They have a completely different  sound than the Beatles.  And to all those people who say that their lyrics  are shallow and meaningless I say this:  If you want something to change  your life, read the bible.  If you want a cd that rocks, buy this!
0684843749|2.0|Interesting insight into the world of bodybuilding and contest strategies by the master himself.  However, some of the exercises and training principles presented are DOWNRIGHT WRONG.  I am an exercise physiologist  and these programs would only work for someone on large amounts of  steroids.
6304884419|5.0|A very good film. Good idea, and actors
0553278223|2.0|The praise on this typewriter drek is hard to fathom. To damn it with faint praise myself, it is a darn good try from a collegeless Mechanics Illustrated fan born right after WWI. It shows no knowledge of science  itself; could Bradbury explain the rocket equation, for instance? Written   right after the a-bomb was dropped on the world's consciousness, and the  mainly white GIs returned home to start the Baby Boom, what it does show is  a thinly disguised attempt at political satire, using &quot;Mars&quot; as a  stage prop. The cartoonish satirization of humanity, 50 years later, seems  silly. Yes, Ray, there were changes in society, and the year 2005 doesn't  look like the year the world will burn, sorry. If it does, there won't be  any people on Mars trying to jump on rockets and get fried either. You did  much better at satire in F451. In TMC, though, why did you end the last  chapter with the &quot;new Noah of Mars&quot; solemnly burning all of  Earth's books? Next thing you know, they'll be burning people up on Mars :)  The quaint descriptions of Bradbury's smalltown life would have done better  in a 'real' novel, say, about a lawyer named Finch fighting racial  prejudice :) In sum, don't read this unless somebody really gives you a  reason, because it's hoplessly obsolete.
0312853238|5.0|Not only is this book amazing, it is even sometimes required for school!  I had to read it in my class and at least half of us loved it so much we read the rest of the series!  The best book I have ever read
038532653X|5.0|It's a shame this is classified as a children's book because both children and adults will gain a great deal by reading this terrific book. Almond successfully weaves all the strands of this story together in a believable  way, or in a way that I want to believe in! I was lucky enough to find this  book after being asked to read it by an elem. school librarian. It meets  all my qualifications for a \\"good book\\": I felt I was in  Michael's world while reading; it made me cry, and most importantly it made  me think. I wish Almond's adult novels were available on amazon.com, but  only one is available on amazon.co.uk. I will look for more from this  author.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Enema of the state is more of a alternative album and not as much punk is on it. It still is a great album to have. &quot;Alien's exist,&quot; &quot;What's my age again,&quot; and &quot;Going away to college&quot; are  all really good songs. If you are looking for more of the punk sound by  blink, then I suggest getting cheshire cat or the josie/apple shampoo  single.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Yes, I know that the heading seems a little over the top, and yes this review is being written by a die hard Blink 182 fan, I didn't think that Chesire Cat, Buddha, or Dude Ranch were perfect. However, I am in full  belief that Enema Of The State is. <br />Every song is incredible, especially  What's My Age Again, Aliens Exist, Going Away To College, Adam's Song  (incredibly moving.), Dumpweed, and The Party Song, plus the album works  even better when you listen straight through. You can't rate this album, it  exceeds ratings. If you don't pick it up, you're missing Blink 182's best  album. They won't be able to top this. Simply put get ready for Blink 182,  cause they ain't gonna stop. (Look for the guys on the Warped Tour!)
6303369170|5.0|vincent gallo is a talented, talented man. johnny depp's abilities are rarely in question, least of all here.  this is a strange, beautifully sad movie that i cannot watch enough.  even jerry lewis demands respect.  words  fail, so just see this film.
6304167660|5.0|This was a great movie with solid acting. Natalie Portman steals the show with her performance. It's a nice story and real enough to believe. More than one plot adds to the good character development.
B00000HZFP|5.0|The boldest, most energetic and most imaginative rock anthem ever....Hedwig, like Rocky Horror will live forever
6305076650|5.0|Before Christmas 1998, pretty much no one at my school had sen RHPS.  But then, on New Years Eve, Comedy Central showed RHPS at a midnight showing. About five people that go to my school saw it (I was one of them).  After  that it spread like the plague.  Everyone was telling everyone about the  movie and it was checked out of all the video stores.  A local TV station  caught wind of it and showed RHPS and SHOCK TREATMENT back to back one  Friday and almost EVERYBODY saw it.  RHPS mania gripped my town!
B00000GUZP|3.0|This is an underated work from an underated artist. An interesting, if not completely successful, collaboration between members of Blondie and Chic. If you like experimental dance-pop that was ahead of its time, you'll like  this.
B00000IQMT|5.0|From the majestic classic main title, to the haunting and innocent &quot;Anakin's Theme,&quot; to the intense, pulse-pounding &quot;Duel of the Fates,&quot; John Williams has shown that his unmatched skill in film  scoring is as strong today as it was 22 years ago.  The score for The  Phantom Menace challenged Williams with creating completely new music,  while drawing occasionally on some of the music from the classic trilogy to  familiarize listeners.  But, new music accounts for about 90% of the  complete score.  And what a score it is.  It combines fast paced action  music, triumphant brass pieces, haunting choral melodies, sweeping  emotional themes, and an unusual, yet entertaining alien band piece.    Williams again uses themes to signify different characters or groups.  Most  notably, is &quot;Anakin's Theme,&quot; a piece that starts out sweetly and  develops into  conveying a sense of questionable things to come.  Listen  closely and you can hear a familiar tune that will remind you of what young  Anakin will one day become.  Williams also has distinct themes for Jar Jar  Binks, the attacking Trade Federation, Qui Gon Jinn, and Anakin's mother,  among others.  The most widely received selection has been  &quot;Duel of  the Fates ,&quot; a fast paced epic piece punctuated with strong coral   parts.  It is an energetic, moving piece that will have you jumping around  your house in a mock - lightsaber duel swinging your wiffle bat around as a  lightsaber.  Well...maybe not...but it's such a thrilling piece!  Overall,  the score is a brilliant addition to the Star Wars series that has truly  met my expectations, and will stay in my CD player throughout the summer.   I highly recommend this to fans and non-fans alike.  It's John Williams!   You can't possibly be disappointed!
6304907648|5.0|Anyone interested in psychology or criminal profiling will definitely enjoy this movie.
0792839730|5.0|This is a great film and I thought this was a high quality transfer - I can't understand the review complaining about the picture quality - looked superb to me - I could'nt see any artefacts - and it's anamorphic.
B000006MS3|5.0|&quot;The Dreaming&quot; is a conceptual masterpiece! Kate Bush outdoes herself with haunting lyrics and musical arrangements I haven't heard since! Anyone who doesn't get this album si a fool...it's not for your  basic NSYNC or Brittney Spears fan, they don't have the mental capacity to  handle Kate!  This is brilliance!  Songs like &quot;Get Out of this  House&quot; and &quot;Houdini&quot; are standouts.
0060977493|3.0|Our book group discussed this book tonight. Quite a few of the 18 or so people present hadn't  finished the book and many didn't plan to. The opening third of the book is tough, because the characters are not well  realized at first, their names sound alike, the author's stance is ironic  so it's hard to sympathize with anyone (this book sure isn't going to send  people touring in India).  I am still not sure why some of the exposition  about characters' earlier lives doesn't come earlier in the novel where it  would help you understand them.  Whether the novel is good enough to  deserve all the effort you have to put in to understand it -- whether most  readers will  have faith that the story will pick up in pace (which it does  somewhere around page 200)  -- I don't know. I wouldn't recommend it to  most of my friends.  And we had mixed but often negative reactions in our  book group.  The author creates some vivid images and scenes, and as one  member pointed out, it's interesting that the mother comes across as fairly  awful as viewed from the perspective of her children's unmet needs as small  children -- but as rather more  wonderful when viewed as a fellow adult (in  the final flashbacks) in an impossible love relationship that crosses the  color line. I am not  sorry I read the book, and after our discussion some members of our book  group said they may finish reading the book.  I thought some of the  language tricks were too cute and  I found many things about the novel  annoying, but in the end I am glad I read it.
0060976624|5.0|One of the five best books I've ever read.  Great message wrapped in laugh out loud on every page.  Mike
B000003TA4|5.0|This cd is a classic and will always be one of the greatest cd's ever.  It began the grunge craze and led to the upcoming of a lot of great bands. Kurt really was a genius and deserved all the credit he got. Despite many  bad veiws as a result of heavy rotation for &quot;Smells Like Teen  Spirit&quot;, the other songs on the cd are very unique. And about Nirvana  using the 60's band name... That band was a flop and Nirvana had every  right to use the name.
0425107469|5.0|This is the be-all-and-end-all, absolute best Dean Koontz novel! (Lightning is runner-up.)  It has everything--pseudoscience, monsters, assassins, great chase scenes, gunplay, love story, a man and his dog,  doggy intellect. You'll laugh, you'll cry--and even better--you'll even cry  for the monster!  Pretty darn cool.
1567184855|5.0|I read this book in ONE SITTING ! I could not put it down. It is easy to read, interesting, and inspirational. If you are interested in Astral Travel, Life after Death,or Reincarnation, you absolutely MUST have this  book in your library. If you are a NON-BELIEVER, this book is still a  &quot;must read&quot;, it is presented in a non-religious, and purely  scientific manner. Even the NON-Believer can appreciate it.
B0000020C4|5.0|This is without a doubt the best Les Miz recording around. What can I say about it other than that it is just brilliant. I can listen to it and imagine the actors going through their paces.<br />If you want to buy a Les  Miz CD get this one. It's worth it!
068484267X|2.0|After having heard so much about the book, I was disappointed when I read it.  Although I empathize with the characters, I did not feel that the writing in a literary sense was anything remarkable - I am surprised it won  the Pulitzer! I felt sorry for the suffering of the author and the family  but having grown up in a third-world country in Asia, I could not help but  think of countless similar children and families who experience the same  suffering but have not even a hope or dream of ever being able to go to  America to improve their lot in life.  A tolerable book but too much hype.
6303168507|4.0|This movie will definitely make any person stop and think.  I do believe that this movie was too long however, the point could have been made in about half the time.
0380789019|4.0|i really enjoyed this book very much. i just bought &quot;stardust&quot; &amp; it was just as good. i just hope he write more books like this.
6300181251|5.0|This movie is Hitchcock at his very best.  It was an excellent movie for me to analyze for my Mysteries In Film and Literature class!  The scene in the motel manager's office between Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins is the  best part of the movie!
068484267X|5.0|For some reason, I resisted buying this book--it looked depressing.  However, when it finally came out in paperback, I decided to read it.  I couldn't put it down.  I hope everyone who reads it  understands how it  feels to be a child in want.  I couldn't put the book down--I alternated  between laughing and crying.
B000002BSG|1.0|Jamiroquai are capitalizing off the electronica/techno bandwagon.  They have no talent at all, and they probably will not last more than one year.  I thought the cd would be good, but it turned out to be the worst  investment i have ever made.  Don't Waste your money.  D-!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002ULO|5.0|This was a really good one, Paul decided to do the old stuff and it worked just fine, there are only a few ugly songs Like used to be bad and Flaming Pie, but the rest are very good. I think the best are Young Boy, Little  Willow, The World Tonight, and Beautiful Night.
B000001F45|5.0|Heep proves, once again, that rock'n'roll can take us to a higher plane.  MAGICIAN'S BIRTHDAY is a spectacular, at times haunting, and ultimately glorious celebration of the magic and mystery that - all to often - escapes  our notice in this work-a-day world.  Kudos to the band for sharing some of  this magic with the rest of us.  I'm eager to find a copy of the short  story upon which it's based.
6305169187|3.0|I think this movie was okay, but there are some things that are too fantastic to believe, like how a bunch of irresponsible rednecks are going into space without the proper training and even worse to a mission that is  so important! <br />Besides that, I think this movie was okay to have a good  time at the movies.
0783226152|5.0|I saw American Graffiti in 1973.  It left a lasting impression.  When the home video became available in 1985, I began watching it over and over.  I became addicted to the film.  The screen-play became just as hard to put  down.  I had to realize that my life a disabled person, found its nitch.   George Lucas captured my life, before I became disabled, through many  characters in the movie.  I believe there is a bit of American Graffiti in  all of us.
0792151712|1.0|It sank. It was sad. But seriously, does a story over the horrible tragedy win an Academy Award for best picture??? No acting skills, all the movie had was good special effects, but that shouldn't have been enough to win an  oscar. What next for the academy?
B00000AFWZ|5.0|WOW!!! I bought this when it first came out last fall and all I can say is it is 1966 and I am 19 years old again! There are so many faves on this that, seven months later, my mind is still boggled. I am glad to see that  several other reviewers had the same reaction as I did; that &quot;96  Tears&quot; was left out. It seemed to be the only missing piece.
0767805712|5.0|This is a little different type of sci-fi.  I like action films but this is a low key aspect of this one.  Mostly it is the story, concept, music, visuals and for some an inspiring movie.  For the short sighted, you make  think it a dreary concept of the future.  The movie portrays courage,  determination and the will to overcome all obstacles; dispite what others  tell you.  Things that some of the critics no nothing about.  Concepts that  you rarely hear about today. It reminds me of one of my favorite sayings  &quot;A man is never beaten until he believes it.&quot;  It is a story of a  man who succeeds despite his critics.
B00000IHHM|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best foreign language musicals I've ever heard.  The melodies are by turns exciting and haunting and the lyrics are some of the most intelligent lyrics you'll find.  They're on a level equal  to Tim Rice and Sondheim.  If this musical does not make Luc Plammondon and  Richard Cocciante well-known on both sides of the Atlantic, nothing will.   In short, BUY THIS CD!!!
B000002U82|4.0|Breath, Time, Money, and maybe another couple  the titles of which are less memorable...they make this album worth buying. There's an excellent movement, clever lyrics in the best tracks. But this is not a five-star  album.
B000002VDW|2.0|By the time Al Stewart got to this album, his creative juices iced over to be replaced by this  easy listening background music.  This seemed to happen to many folk-based musicians around this time (Ian Matthews, Ralph  McTell, etc.).  Buy &quot;Past, Present and Future&quot; or &quot;Modern  Times&quot; instead.  Both are *well worth* the $$$.
B000000W5N|5.0|I bought this record two days ago based on the reviews here. The album is astoundingly good. Unfortunately only ten of the songs included here stand out as brilliant rock and roll. Oh Well.
B00000JCB3|5.0|Every song on this CD is cool even the parts where Fred raps.  Buy this CD now.
B000002C1X|3.0|The spirit of this music is sickly. An animal that needs to be shot. Its high points are sublime. It's never boring (it is making you sick or youre into it). Buy Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main Street, Hendrix, something that  rocks before you open your wallet for this thing.
B000002L9J|5.0|As a huge Smiths fan from way back, I have to say this stands up as my favorite of their albums. It kills me that 'Cemetry Gates' didn't end up on the &quot;Best&quot; compilations--it's such a fun, weird song! And I  couldn't have made it through high school without 'The Light That Never  Goes Out.'
B000000W5L|5.0|This album is a slow burn. It was the second helping that really hooked me. Sticky Fingers and Exile. Rock and Roll can not be better than this.
0780627016|5.0|I have always been upset that this film never received the attention it deserved at its release. Many probably saw the effects in the trailer and decided there was nothing else to it. Some probably saw the sitcom-style  premise and expected weightless comedy. Others who saw the film decided  that it was a jokey put-down of 1950s America and left it at that.<br />They  all missed the point.<br />Pleasantville is that rare piece of art that works  on many levels, and has as much depth as you are willing to see. The  metaphor of color only seems gimmicky if you haven't seen how it is used.  Better yet, this film rewards repeat viewings and discussion. It also has  that other hallmark of great storytelling: Its two-hours-plus seem to fly  by in an instant. I dare anyone to watch fifteen minutes and not be hooked.<br />Go ahead. Rent it. You'll be back to buy it.
B00000BKI4|5.0|Judging from the number of less than positive reviews on this web page, i'd say that these blokes haven't even listened to this album.  Ever.  Indeed, using a mix of orchestral, dreamy, and derelict arrangements and  pleasing sonic twirls, this album is a pleasure to listen to, and certainly  pushes the envelope using melody, dynamics, and beautiful texture.
067144901X|5.0|This book was my daugther's favorite.  The lyrical beat, and simple and familiar sounds makes it a delight to read to the audience under 2.
0783228317|5.0|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not just a movie...it's an experience.  &quot;What's it like to be on drugs,&quot; you ask.  Terry Gilliam shows us.  The words of Hunter S. Thompson's novel about the quest for the  &quot;American dream&quot; come to life on the screen with psycadelic humor  and realism.  Not just a adaptation to Thompson's tale, but a tribute.  True, this film is not for everyone...some may even find it too bizarre.  But maybe that's the problem with Hollywood these days.  We've become too  comfortable with films recently...we need a lot more Fear and Loathing on  our screens and in our lives.  Watch and enjoy...feed your head.
0385493800|5.0|I really did enjoy The Testament and I will have to go out and read his other books.  I would love to see this movie on screen.  I loved the characters and how they lived their lives. The Phelen children really did  fascinate me with their greed and avarice lifestyles and not to mention how  they just couldn't  believe what the father did to them.  Nate, the lawyer  was an interesting character  as well as  Rachel Lane.  I loved this book  and will be the first in the theater when  it hits the screen.   Sigourney  Weaver  would make a great Rachel .
B000002OZY|5.0|Great by any standards.  Forget the greatest hits albums...if you're only going to buy one Who album, buy this one! Nevermind that its a rock-n-roll classic or pioneering rock opera, the music is just awesome.
B000002J23|5.0|OK, its 1980 (when prog was dead), and John and Rick are gone, replaced by New Wavers.  If you can't get past these ideas, you'll be too prejudiced to give it a try.  If you think of it as a totally different group, its a  different story.  Its practically the last hurrah for classic progressive  rock, especially the epic &quot;Machine Messiah&quot;.  The album is harder  and less optimistic than classic Yes.  This album is a must-have if you are  a bass nut; Chris Squire is definetely the dominant force here.
0553278355|4.0|Sylvia Plath's account of a young woman's descent into madness is a startling, often amusing, and sometimes terrifying tale. Her use of simile is astounding and her straight-forward approach to the main character's  thoughts and feelings really gives you a sense of the young girl's plight.  A good read that, while sometimes tedious, is definitely worth the time.
0679890475|5.0|This was my absolute favorite book as a child!! Young readers learn to anticipate the action in the story, as the little bird searches for its mother. The illustrations are not as colorful as other popular books today,  but the story makes up for this.
0670888443|4.0|True story of the 3 little pigs as told by A.Wolf, is a colorful and imaginitive retelling of a classic!   Even though the book is for children, I think I enjoyed it more than my kids! Of course, I remember the original  and the original, apparently, left out quite a bit.  It's a great gift for  grown ups too.
0793518326|5.0|No other recording artist could inspire this kind of labor of love for the authors.  Where else could you find the sheet music for &quot;Slow Down,&quot; let alone a transcription of all the instruments?  Also, Chuck  Berry doesn't let just anyone publish his tunes.  As a drummer,  transcriptions of any popular music's drums are a treat, but as a Beatles  fan, these are indispensible. This doesn't mean; however, that these pages  are wholly accurate.  Many of the cool riffs we listen for on the coda are  missing on the songs with a fade-out.  A key drum fill on &quot;I Am The  Walrus&quot; is transcribed as coming a  measure after it does on the  record.  On &quot;Drive My Car&quot; the distinctive drum fills which occur  on the last line of each verse are transcribed as the same combination each  time, instead of each being unique. All in all, though, there is not  another music book like this.  I doubt there ever will be.  Especially for  Beatles fans, but really for anyone who enjoys classic rock 'n' roll.
6303149200|5.0|The movie does a good job highlighting the different philosophies behind the &quot;Old ways&quot; (paganism) and Christianity.  The movie also turns the mirror on Christianity a faith that has burned more than one 'witch'.   &quot;Wicker Man&quot; can be disturbing to those who may not understand  Paganism and fundamentalists. The full length version is the way to go.  If  you can find it.  This movie needs to be made more available to the  public!!!!!!!!
0399143904|5.0|Interesting that several readers were disappointed in this roller coaster read. I couldn't disagree more. A lot of very bad people meet instant, violent death. How could you not be entertained? I've been waiting for  Clancy to thrill me the way he did in &quot;Without Remorse&quot; and  &quot;Rainbow Six&quot; delivers thrills by the truckload. Tense, and (for  Clancy), sparse prose makes for a capivating read. The only gripes I had  were it's not yet in paperback and my President isn't the calibre of a Jack  Ryan.
6304935811|5.0|This is the best war movie I have ever seen
0446605409|5.0|It's a good story. Because I was stationed on the island during WW II, I had a special interest.
0887306667|4.0|If you just see this book as a markeing guideline, it is probably not worth buying, but... ... it cites the critical points and makes you thinking. You can even transfer these rules to finance, the stock  market,your life. The best chapter is the last one.
0393307050|5.0|Reading &quot;Master &amp; Commander&quot; can be hard because he tells you a lot about sailing ships and the navy, using terms that are unfamiliar.  But I listened to an (unabridged) book-on-tape of this book,  and it was splendid.  You roll with the story!  You get in the tempo and  feel the excitement of a wind coming up!  (And I've never been on a  sailboat!) If, at times, I was confused with the sailing jargon, I rewound  and listened again, or kept going, depending on how interesting the arcane  tidbit seemed to me.  I highly highly highly recommend this book  -   though, if you're like me, a cassette version will better suit.

B00000ILDE|3.0|I LOVED the first Alien film however the second one, &quot;ALIENS&quot; was weird. I never understood how in a time of suspended animation we need to send marines dweebs with bullets. It just doesn't make sense!
0767817478|1.0|Ugggghh! What a waste of time and money.Hollywood thinks that all you have to do to update a movie is to add computer effects. There's no need for a script or actors who can act (shame on you Mathew Broderick). This movie is  particularly painful for any true Godzilla fan. Leave Godzilla movies to  the Japanese, because Hollywood doesn't &quot;get it&quot;.
015626224X|5.0|'Down and Out' provides a fascinating social commentary of the international underclass.  90% self-documentary, 10% personal philosophy, I think this book provides an effective balance of Orwell's experiences and  his thoughts on society.  A great book to own and discuss.
014034294X|5.0|This book is reaaly great. The author really inspires me. If you read this book you will get a wonderful felling inside. It is really interesting to read this book. This book is about this girl named Matilda that has really  mean parents she is born with a loving soul.But when her parents don't take  them with her she goes to the library. we'll the main part is that she is  ignored by her parents.
0062502182|5.0|No matter what race or creed a reader may be, they cannot help but feel a deep admiration for, perhaps a hint of jealousy toward, Santiago and his journey. So few people have the courage - because that's what it takes - to  follow their dream. It's so much easier to fall into the rut of life: the  routine, the job, the everyday things that eventually kill the spirit  before the person even suspects that something is wrong. Whoever wrote for  the Kirkus Reviews obviously lives in a glass house - this person sounded  almost annoyed that everyone in the book &quot;has to put in their two  cents' worth&quot;. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that in reality,  that's how life works. EVERYONE has an opinion about your life - your  partner, parents, friends, co-workers, family, even people on the street.  This book is anything but bland. On the contrary, it is an inspiration for  those who feel that their lives control them instead of the other way  around. It is not about dropping everything in search of your dream, but  realizing that sometimes we get so stuck in the rut of life that we don't  see our dream right under our nose. And yet, there it sits....just  waiting....
0345350472|4.0|Now I know why most people who like the book also like the movie or vice versa. It works because both are original in their own way. If Ridley Scott had made his movie 1 to 1 from the book, he would have bored us to death.  The book thrives almost entirely on dialogue (internal and external) and on  description of minutae (just think of the scene with Isidore, the Andys and  the Spider!). PKD is such a great writer, he doesn't need movement to  captivate the reader, he simply creates his dark and surreal world,  populated with reluctant protagonists driven by powers beyond their  control.
B00000J6AG|4.0|Moby is truly a unique artist. I couldve never thought that id b bopping my head to remixed, updated techno versions of blues' songs, but here I am doing exactly that. Some great little ditties are on this album. Only  complaint is that he couldve cut 4 or 5 weak tracks which are present  towards the end of the album to make it smoother, yet I still cant  complain. Album is tres cool
6300183513|5.0|This is my all time fave movie, altho I haven't been able to buy it, I look forward to seeing it whenever I can. The plot is so intriguing.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|This album is wonderful! You get a touch of pop, latin soul, and an already well-known personality. We all know how good her hit &quot;If You Had My Love&quot; is, but this album is much more than just that song. It  has two versions of her Spanish ballad &quot;No Me Ames&quot; with Marc  Anthony, a fantastic love song with &quot;Should've Never&quot;, another  song with a pop/spanish beat with &quot;Let's Get Loud&quot;, and 9 other  wonderful songs. Also, for those of you who say she is bad because of her  live performance on David Letterman, you should think. This album isn't  live, and she has the studio to back up her singing. If you didn't like her  performance, than you shouldn't go to her concerts. So, in my own, and many  others, opinion, I think Jennifer will hit it big with her music career,  and those who don't think so should listen a little closer the next time  they listen to her songs.
B000002UDB|5.0|This album is the first album by the beatles that purchased and since then I have only been able to find one or two which have been as good or better.  This is one of those rare albums which you can listen to it all the way  through without skipping a song.  If you are looking to get into the  Beatles this is one I deffinitly reccomend as a top purchase.                           Haackebone
0345423496|1.0|I really enjoyed the previous books in this series and I was really excited when I heard that the final installment had been written, but I was sorely disappointed with this lame and pathetic effort.  I couldn't become  involved with any of the characters at all.  Clarke seems to have  characters in the book only as an excuse to give an exposition of what he  believes future technology will bring us.  Actually, this entire novel,  including the entire monolith portion of the story seems extraneous.  It  seems as if Mr. Clarke simply wanted to deliver his futuristic fantasies  about technology and put a few modern dollars in his bank account.  The  plot was lame, the characters as featureless as the page I was reading them  from, and the ending simply uninspired.  This is how the devices of aliens  who can transform themselves into pure energy are defeated?  With a  computer virus?  Please.<br />As many loose ends are exposed as tied up here.   Now we only have to fear 4001: The Final Oddessey Plus One Thousand, when  the supervisor monolith responds to the message and Halman has to be exumed  by Poole, who has miraculously survived another millenium only to find that  his life is just as boring and emotionally dead as ever.
6301773551|5.0|It is the greatest movie no matter what anyone says about it.  Lucas is a genius.  The script was written beautifully written.
B000002GJH|5.0|I don't think that you'll find too many recently released CDs with the drive to have you crank up your player. This has go the voice and the striving courage of the Seatle Sound all over it. This is a great CD and I  think that anyone that likes Pearl Jam, Sound Garden, Mad Season, Alice and  Chains will surely fall in love with this CD.
0783225733|5.0|The suspense of this true drama is enticing even though the ending is an historical legend.  I never cease to be amazed by the intensity of this film.  It will grip you like no other, and must be a part of your  collection, so that it can be viewed again and again.  Fine performances by  an all star cast, awesome cinematography, and the reality based script are  only a few of the reasons this film is a classic.
0385484518|5.0|ALS is a disease where a persons body degeneratesover time until they basically sufficate to death. But the mind is not affected physically...This book left my husband in tears and deep thought.  He lost  his estranged father to ALS 25 years ago. He was able to finally grieve  over his father's death. To understand this disease is one aspect of this  book. Another aspect of this book is to gain perspective on how YOU will  celebrate your own death.  My views have changed. I'm with Morrie.  &quot;A  living funeral&quot;, is my celebration of choice.
0316152196|5.0|This book kept you interested.  I couldn't wait to find out who did it. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
6304297912|5.0|Trainspotting is one of the most exhilarating movies I have seen in a long time.  I immediately went and bought the book by Irvine Welsh.  The novel was equally as amazing.  The plot and characters become a bit muddled from  the novel, but that was necessary considering the novel is really a  collection of short stories.  Ewan McGregor is generally a dorky actor, but  in Trainspotting one can separate the actor from the character.  I fell in  love with Renton, the narrator of the film, and plan to make this movie my  permanent favorite.
B000001F6N|4.0|This album was the crucial follow up to the landmark Bluesbreaker record with Eric &quot;slowhand&quot; Clapton. On &quot;A Hard Road&quot; we see Peter Green carving his own niche as one of the most influential British  blues guitarists. His tone  makes the devil melt and on songs like  &quot;Someday after a while (you'll be sorry)&quot;, you hear some of the  most gut wrenching sorrowful solos you could hope to hear. You will also  hear Green's achingly poignant blues voice for the first time on recording.  A true lost legend, this is Green coming into his own before forming  Fleetwood Mac and outselling The Beatles in 1969. Mr. Mayall himself keeps  shaking thing up with added instruments that would lead up to his eventual  big band leaning ala B.B. King. A must have for Peter Green fans as well as  Bluesbreaker fans.
0792841050|5.0|This film was shown in my daughter's high school history class as a reward.  She went out and rented it for her brothers.  They all loved it.  They said it was a &quot;must have&quot; video. (These are teenagers!) They  loved the portrayal of York and his humility and humor.
0783226004|5.0|This movie is one of the few &quot;hacker&quot; movies that doesn't suck.  Maybe it's because 'A' was a consultant. (from RSA ... the encryption algorithm).  Definitely required viewing for all computer geeks.
6305177473|2.0|Honestly, this movie gravels to the original
B000002UB3|5.0|This is by far the best album the Beatles ever made.  The wit behind the entire album is extraordinary.  The meddly at the end livens up the album.  There is not one bad song on this album.  Even Ringo's &quot;Octopus's  Garden&quot; is great. This album leaves no reason for anyone to hate the  Beatles.
B000002J27|5.0|When Peter Gabriel left Genesis, many fans assumed a close eared stance to the new lineup with Phil Collins as vocalist.  Where Genesis' work with Gabriel was brilliant and influenced progressive-rock musicians and fans  throughout the globe, the collective works of the incarnation with Phil  Collins as vocalist in collaboration with Steve Hackett, Tony Banks and  Mike Rutherford stands up equally well over time. Gabriel's departure  forced the remaining quartet to become a more cohesive collective unit and  their efforts on Trick of the Tail, Wind and Wuthering and the difficult to  find ep, Spot the Pidgeon, are all excellent recordings. As a unit, they  became a tighter and more powerful collaborative force.  The songwriting of  this period is also quite exceptional.  The only flaw on this disc are the  lyrics on Robbery, Assault and Battery, a noble but failed effort.   Otherwise this disc is well worth the purchase...Simon
