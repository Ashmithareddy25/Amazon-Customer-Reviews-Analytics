B00WTCSN5G|5|Perfect fit. The suction cups are a bit weak in the backing. Don't yank them off quickly. Everyone in a sunny state should own these !
B00LEBLI82|5|They've been installed in my motor home for over a week now and they're great! They put off a bright white light and are clearly pulling less energy from my batteries so I'm not having to run the generator as much. I only wish I had purchased these sooner. The incandescent bulbs they replaced put off so much heat that when enough were turned on it would heat up the RV, and that's one of the last things you need when camping in the Arizona summers.
B0050VH4O4|1|Junk.  One DOA and on the other 3 of the LEDs flicker like a strobe light.  The contact caps soldered to each side of the PCB are crooked, flux still all over the PCB.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Lesson learned.
B000C2CNHE|5|Excellent
B0049PLFFG|5|This was the right part for my car and it worked great.  Would recommend and buy from again.
B00FF1K7BQ|5|I use the 2 of these together and they are the best I've used so far, scents are long lasting and makes my car smell like it just rolled off the showroom floor!
B007ZD35J8|5|Excellent quality<br />Easy installation<br />Great functionality<br /><br />Stop pondering and BUT IT NOW!
B0051D3MP6|5|Compact, easy to use.  Cord length was sufficient. I will buy again if I need more.
B00H7DT0UY|5|Everything as expected. worked out great for my 2005 Yamaha r6
B00N3RM186|5|Better than expected.
B00OMHW01Y|3|I purchased both the clear and the tinted visors. I have yet to put them on the helmet because I just bought the helmet as and purchased these for future replacement. I also purchased due to several reviews commenting on the original visor distorting vision somewhat but that was not my experience. Everything looks great but I can't give it more stars until I actually put it on.
B00N5UBQHS|5|I already have 3 of these units for mowers, trucks and now i have 1 for my boat
B000CBTGHK|5|Super Duties were made for a deflector. There are holes in the OEM hood and you just have to screw this thing on. Literally takes longer to find the Philips screwdriver than to install.
B002306SU6|5|no comment
B00JH33YU4|1|Did not fit propertly especially the back mats, judt did not look good
B004I12424|5|Fast shipping, exactly what I needed
B00MMKPK0G|2|Pretty small for the fob.  That's all it will hold.  The actual key chain broke fairly easily and quickly.
B0068ER03C|3|Good
B00REV5C42|1|This item does not stand up to UV rays of the sun.  It has already torn due to low quality of material
B00NWGZ3A6|5|small and simple to use. perfect
B00C4B1F7U|4|2010 Rav4, base model. Fit is fine, bike rack clears tire.  Round wire brush needed to clean out factory bolt holes.
B00279BFCY|5|Great product.
B00WINB3KS|2|They did not fit the rim as good as they could have. But when you stick them there stuck.
B00YDL19D4|1|This was not at all what was described. It proved useless.
B00JFDIV4A|5|Fit like a glove. Easy to install too. Just twist off the old one (there is a release tab which you will need a screwdriver) and remove. New one is loaded side ways then twisted into place. It was an OEM product!
B006JG5BG2|2|Inflated four bike tires -- took about five minutes -- after which the unit was extremely hot and smelled of burning plastic/rubber/motor. Worried about the longevity of this.
B001G6M7OY|5|Very nicely built and has the cover to prevent water from infiltrating the mechanism. As anything Mercedes if you use the service manual and some online forums it is relatively easy to install. The hardest part for me was getting the 30 year old door panel off with all the screws and clips.
B00027H32O|4|Fit just like the one that came off.  Hopefully will hold up for the next 5+ years.
B008H7FJJU|5|Looks great, but I had to take out my hitch lock.
B00AN5WBJ0|5|great fit, installed without a hitch
B00RHAQ5YQ|1|Brake lever fits, but clutch lever does not fit. 07 KTM 450 XCW and the clutch lever will not work for this bike
B00XY615LU|3|Everything as expected, however right side LED indicator arrived not working.
B006OQ35GU|2|Works, but leaks at connection with sewer hose, which is also made by Camco.  I had to make a rubber washer to put into the connection to stop the leak.
B0030V6XW0|4|yes this does work
B003E1SK5Y|5|All good.  Easy to change out.
B000FGKBU8|4|Good price for this level.  Should really help to set up RV.
B00WFI0W2Q|5|Thought I was going to have to replace the head gasket on my Forester because of a miss fire on cylinder #4. However I added 2 bottles of this Subaru coolant system conditioner and the issue went away almost immediatly!
B00KZD8JV4|5|great lights, easy to install, looks amazing in the nights...
B001ADBV18|1|This item states it is for a Toyota Tundra.  It does not fit a Toyota Tundra.  It also states it fits a GMC Sierra.  It also does not fit the GMC Sierra.  I shipped this to my dad for Father's day.  He told me it didn't fit and was going to give it to my husband for his truck.  We are in different states.  It took 3 weeks to get the item to try on the Sierra to find out it doesn't fit.  I am beyond my return date now.  The item didn't come with screws either.  I would sell it to someone else but I have no idea what type of truck it fits.  I have attached the picture of the box so you can see what it states it fits.
B00CU6IY0A|5|Fits my 2004 forester perfect. Shipping was quick and product felt pretty solid, would buy again.
B000CJ20B6|4|A little big for my trailer, but still it was a GREAT price.
B002H5I17A|5|Fits like a glove in a 7.3L Super Duty . Here is all you need:<br /><br />-Spectre Performance 9719 6&#34; Straight Aluminum Intake Tube. (had to cut down, shorter version wasn't in stock at the time).<br /><br />-Spectre Performance 9704 4&#34; Hose Clamps, comes with 2, you only need one.<br /><br />-30 minutes of your valuable time.
B004R36KLO|5|Fits and works perfectly. Installing the bolts through the factory frame took a little work, but it was worth it in the end. Great product!
B00B2B4D4A|4|I'm torn between 3 or 4 stars. The overall outcome is a 4, the instructions and diy setup was a 2 with parts quality a 3.<br /><br />The spacers themselves seem high quality, the brake brackets and sway bar link are minimalist at best. I was surprised the links don't have a ball joint to improve flex and limit future squeaks. The brake extensions are fine for the rear but could have used actual engineering for the front.<br /><br />Instructions were pretty rough, gladly they did make some video and even though more effort and detail could have been put in.. they gave me enough info and clues to get it done. Thankfully youtube has many jk lift viedos so got it all figured out.<br /><br />Having an impact gun for the rear spacer mount made it much easier, with handtools the washer/nut kept spinning... the impact helped it set fast and torque tight.<br /><br />I have done motor work, head swaps, timing chains etc and this tested my patience! The end result is impressive so in the end it was worth it and I didn't even bleed! Lol, haha.<br /><br />Oh, the jeep is basically perfectly level! No more rake and braking feels more controlled. I did upgrade to red Rubicon shocks and medium stiff springs at the same time. It now sits 39&#34; ground to stock fender all the way around. My oem springs were the softest spring rate and rear shocks were bad with 7k on them! That's what lead to doing the lift now, why replace shocks when you can upgrade... in the end im happy with it.
B00P8ALB7I|5|Thx got it yesterday works great perfect fit for my 07 f150.
B0058O7AW4|5|Very simple install and the faucet works very well.  The taller faucet makes it much easier to wash tall items in the sink.
B005ASY23I|5|Nice and quiet compared to other portable compressors I have used.  Inflated a 215/60/r16 Hyundai Sonata tire from 0 psi to 35.5 psi in 2 min and 28 sec.  The gauge shows higher psi while pump is on but shows tire psi when switched off.  I inflated tire to 40 psi then switched unit off.  Gauge dropped to about 36 psi.  I unhooked the pump and verified psi with my &#34;trusted&#34; tire gauge which read 35.5 psi.  While on, the pump wiggled on the ground but did not try and wonder away from vibrations.  Would be nice if Viair included a carry bag or hard plastic container to keep everything tucked away and protected while in a car trunk.  Will be purchasing a couple more of these for all my vehicles.
B000BRHBC2|1|Leaked  through the welds on first fill up.
B000NCUWIK|5|Nice little plug for the city water connection.  This replaced the original rubber plug that rotted away after a couple years.  I simply attached the lanyard under one of the screws holding the connection in place.
B00IZ4Y60S|5|I am very happy with this MotoSculpt Oil Filler Cap/Plug. Fast delivery, perfect fit, excellent quality and ability to safety wire in place.
B00NHMDRD0|3|My Homeboys sons Birthday present he loved them..
B001445IZ8|5|Works great.  It came with a couple small dents, but still works perfectly.
B00042KGWG|5|great product
B00EEKKAKM|4|I made it work, I like it, but if someone without my knowhow got one they may not have their system working.  there are 2 layouts for the positive bus, the photo showed the bus set up I wanted, the one I received has the bus on the other contact. I did have enough cable length to flip flop my cables to work/fit. system functions perfectly.
B00AWO7XOK|5|Fits my 2016 Mazda 6 iSport and installed very easily. While my fog light kit included wiring and a simple small button switch, since my car was already prewired for fog lights, swapping out the entire light stalk was by far the easiest option. With this switch, the fog lights have an on/off setting, but only go on with the low beams on. So if you want it to go on independently, you have to install a separately wired switch and not this one.
B00NX8EYFI|5|Great quality decals, easy to place and instructions were included!
B007Y86Q7M|5|worked like described.
B003ECULUU|1|Cheap plastic, difficult to install. Sun visor drops down unexpectedly.
B000BUU5Z4|3|Good idea.
B00B32DF24|5|Love it! really makes a difference towing my loaded 8000 lb trailer with the Tundra. Would recommend this upgrade this to everyone.
B005BOQV58|2|it works but it should it is not very sturdy.
B000EDSSMA|5|Adds valuable work space to your RV
B004EDF8HY|3|Hard to splice because of the material around the wires.
B0060A86FU|2|Ordered size for 2004 range rover.. Size was wrong, too small.
B001CO317M|4|Delivers as promised
B00SCYVEPG|5|Perfect
B000NCOKZQ|5|good
B000GOHUVM|5|Installed easily, less than 3 minutes. Quieter than my OEM blower. Installed on a 2006 Toyota Tundra Extended cab SR5. Highly recommend!!!
B00H58W59Y|3|Had to return did not fit my socket drive. Okay if you have a 1/2 inch set.
B004R3DR60|5|Excellent hitch. Fit my 2013 Outback like a glove. I watched a lot of youtube (and e-trailer) videos and read others experiences before I installed - saved me a lot of headache. I recommend that you follow their (and now my) advice, and drill the holes from above, as the metal is much thinner and doesn't make an extra route for water to get into the frame. You can pull back the trip that is to the left and right of the wheel well and see four holes covered in black tape. Drill those out and use them for access to the frame rails below. The only &#34;hitch&#34; with the install was that I tried to use a 1 1/8 inch hole cutting bit, and the pilot bit (and the attached drill and person) danced around quite a bit and made an ugly yet still 1 1/8 inch hole. I just filed it down and covered it with duct tape when I was done. You'll never see it again... If you feel like dropping an additional 50-60 bucks, buy a stepped drill bit. The ACE by my house didn't have one that went up to 1 1/8.<br /><br />The holes lined up quite nicely. If you can get a helper (or two) to lift up the receiver, you'll be lucky. I did the &#34;awkward bench press&#34; to lift it up from my chest, then turned sideways so that my left shoulder would hold the frame against the car while my right hand threaded the nut on the bolt. Repeat process for other side, then getting the two forward bolts on is easy. Don't torque down till you have everything lined up, or else getting the heat shield back on will be impossible (holes won't line up properly).<br /><br />The hitch is very solid and well built. We keep a four bike thule parkway rack on the back of the subaru, and it's quite solid. Haven't tried towing yet. The packaging was so-so, but this is my third hitch install (other two were honda CRV and odyssey - much easier), the other two hitches also arrived in mangled boxes. I think it goes with the territory. I would definitely buy this product again.
B008RN668W|1|You know what would be awesome? If Pit Posse actually put a real picture of the product on the sale ad. Then stupid people like me wouldn't see a picture of a bright aluminum shelf, order it .. and then receive a BLACK shelf that doesn't match one other shelf in the whole trailer. I wonder if it's easier to simply put the right picture on the ad ... or for me to repack, drive to a shipper, pay for shipping, hope to receive credit someday, etc. Yes, I know, if I would read every word in all the description AND IGNORE the picture, I would be okay. Note, I did call myself stupid.
B00064331I|2|Bristle is too stiff
B00DQRSK9C|5|Great battery.
B00WL3NSSK|2|Nice design, but decal arrived with a separation from the backing that put a permanent crease in the decal.
B00W3IIWS4|1|took over a month to recieve with no tracking updates. recieved today, and product wont fit anything. its trash. thank you, china.
B002M9W7RQ|3|too tall for a 2015 Dyna FXDF. Need to use without adapters.
B004V9UDK8|5|Well worth the money. Thanks
B00DSW8PH2|2|The retractor broke at first use.
B00L32LMVA|5|fits great on my 2015 tacoma
B00MH9VC68|5|Fixed my VTS module issues that I had.
B00KWDRM6U|5|Very pleased!
B00WFHY2F0|1|Review is repeatedly deleted unless it's 3 or more stars. Don't buy this.
B005HAYDR4|5|Works great.
B00E975LH2|5|Love plasti dip, never can go wrong with this great product. Dont like the paint? Peel it off and start over or change the color.
B005VKLGUW|4|it works!!!!
B000IYR7R2|5|Perfect fit runs just as expected
B00HZ2LNGQ|5|Prompt shipment....exactly what I needed.
B003YMX0SK|5|delco products have been very reliable for years and dont expect these to be any different
B0073MGC00|4|It doesn't seat quite right on my 2003 isuzu rodeo (the tabs don't sit in the holes).  Still worked fine.
B003D4MA30|5|Didn't use this one my car, but gave it to a friend of mine, and she loves it.
B001OE2842|5|I love the frame, but on the website there is a question from someone asking if this is sold in pairs; the answer to it was yes, it is sold in pairs. This is absolutely not true; there is only one frame in the package. If you want two, you must order two. I understand that a frame of this quality would not be $37 for one, so I started to order two anyway. However, if there were two to a package, I did not want to have to send one back. I guess I'll have to decide whether I want our car look better coming or going until I get another one. : )
B0091OE6K6|3|doesnt  hold seat belt securely,, it keeps slipping out of clip.
B00CU9W8DG|5|Nice product and arrived when expected.
B00WOT3YM6|4|Takes a while to pump up a tire if its 5 or 6 psi under but it gets the job done. So far works very well.
B001DBVOXW|5|Exactly as described, fast shipping......
B00HYIFK4C|4|We love it!
B00IT9MBV0|5|Exactly as pictured. Wish i could move it after placed. Oh well
B000IEH7IQ|5|great runner
B00LNOK4E4|5|The lights are bright but you need to add a resistor to stop annoying error messages. I'm using this on a 2010 BMW 528i xDrive, The angel eyes are a brighter white.
B00SKVZ4GG|5|my dad owns the trd pro and i love the look of the look of the trd pro floor mats
B008CE0O8E|5|Works great with my Triumph Bonneville T214 (T100).  I installed female threads on the trailer floor and use hex head bolts to attach the chock so it is easily removable.
B00P9OEZS0|1|This product is not a trim restore ... It's clear coat spray paint !!!!! It got on my windows .. Overspray everywhere .. Had to remove with rubbing alcohol . It is a pita!!!!USE WIPE NEW OR STONERS TRIM SHINE !!! Stay away from spray paint !!!!
B00ICG3GBE|2|It looks nice but didnt fitted exatly , its more curved than its base!
B00062Z05W|5|Fits well.
B003WOIT04|5|Worked great
B00NMOWZP4|5|excelente
B0087PAL68|5|fits
B000BRFQKQ|1|The wind makes this useless.
B00H6ETIWY|4|Just what I needed to complete my off-road project. Exactly as described... not too large and yet serviceable.
B008ZU86P8|5|Love these!! Comfortable and durable
B00QGJGP5I|3|must put something on both hooks to balance it
B004RCV0OM|5|High quality and what is recommended by several RV manufactures, works great
B0002SRCMO|5|Received promptly, exactly as described.  It's a tool - if it looks like it will work for you then buy it.
B0024E6UE0|5|The product arrived in two days and fit perfectly. Make sure you order the correct size for your furnace. Also, find the smallest zip ties you can. Instructions say one on the left and one on the right. I added one additional in the middle so there was no gap. I could put 4 stars but I'm giving it 5.
B0006MRS7U|4|it worked perfect
B001G7L2Y4|5|I put this on every car BMW I own or change the oil on. Cheap, great quality, and the magnetic feature is neat and turns out to be a pleasant surprise how much you appreciate the magnetic aspect of it.
B00AECBNWS|5|Easy to install in 2015 Silverado 6.5' bed.
B00K24P8JM|5|Nice product
B001GC2LVM|5|This is an excently product. Make leveling the camper so much easier.
B00DQXR89O|5|Can this be installed on an automatic C6 LS2?
B0041K6X9M|2|Doesn't hang right on the back of the seat.  Interferes with the passenger's knees.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Only used once to air down, but it works great.
B00I5HRTU4|5|Works well
B00B21R0TA|5|Came quickly,  im pretty happy with them! They work much better than my stock 97 honda accord lights. Alil work to put them in but very happy
B00Z7KIZPA|5|I don't think I have ever purchased anything that was so easy to install. I don't think it took 10 seconds and My husband and I both love the convenience of the Purse Pouch. Anything we put in there is stable and easily accessible. We love it!
B00TTH0KS2|5|the sticker was so beautiful..i will be ordering my stickers from them from now on.
B007CDYX7Y|5|WORKED GREAT
B00MAG6RMM|5|These are a great replacement LED bulb for your standard map light 194 bulb.  Installation is easy and as the directions and most people have stated if it does not light up just flip the bulb.  The light emitted by these compared to your standard bulb i would rate is about 3 times brighter.  When I installed these on my girlfriends Prius C it was literally night and day difference pun intended.  At night its very hard to see because her car did not come equipped with a center dome light.  So it relies solely on the 2 front map lights to illuminate the car.  With these led bulbs that problem was cheaply and easily resolved.  After installing them I went crazy and started replacing every bulb on the car with leds.  The license plates the front parking lights and turn signal lights.  Now the front parking lights have a clean light it makes me want to upgrade the headlights to hids so they will match.<br /><br />I have tried other brand generic leds that you can find on ebay and these in comparison are much better quality.  I have tried their other version of dome light leds and they utilize a heat sink on the back which the first time I have seen that which goes to show  you the quality of these leds.<br /><br />I enclosed a few images  and it goes without saying which bulb is the led and which is not. I was supplied this product to test and evaluate at a discounted price in return for my honest and true review.
B008OEQ6WU|5|Exactly what I needed. It looks good, and works well. I will buy another one in the future.
B000E28CKY|5|Filter oil like no ones business. Last several oil changes in the SM.
B00VIL91UA|4|Perfect fit!
B00FSG8224|5|Purchased 18 for my TT two months ago.  All 18 are still working and I love them!  Great battery savings and the place is SOOOOOO much brighter!  Was surprised at the 120 degrees of rotational adjustability, VERY nice feature that has been taken advantage of above the bed -- way too bright for the bed, but once they are turned toward the back of the trailer, the intensity is lowered for the bed and just redirects the extra light toward the back!<br /><br />Very satisfied and highly recommend.
B000C8Z8RA|5|Great muffler. Stainless last longer than the plain type. 5-6 years in Wisconsin.
B002ZS4QCS|5|Everyone that sees these in my car wants to order them. They hold my laptop case, my purse, and grocery bags in place so they don't fly when I go around a bend or stop or accelerate. Need to get a few more. They are handy at home in the shower, laundry, and kitchen.
B004BOXKN0|3|Keeping it short the price is right but it doesn't fit the KLR650 as claimed.<br /><br />The mechanism that expands inside the handlebars is too small for the KLR650. I would have given 2 stars or less but its actually made pretty well and even after torquing the screws pretty tight didn't strip the aluminum.<br /><br />If you have a KLR650 I'd look elsewhere.
B00EHIPQ1E|5|Excellent look! Makes my car look like a new car
B00DNT916O|5|Excellent.
B00DR67P9I|5|It's a great product at a great price.
B000FPAIP2|5|exactly
B00WN5BM3E|5|Awesome product fast shipping! Thank you!
B008O5KAOO|3|it ok
B000BUU5XG|5|Excellent product. Installs easily. A bit costly for what it is although does the job
B0006JLU1I|5|This is a well made, tough and sturdy product... Better than New!
B00MY2IU7C|3|These brake pads have been deemed fitting for the 1998 323is but as I was watching my mechanic fit them on I would say this is a questionable designation. I mean he got them to fit,  and I have yet to die in a 5 car pile up but the clips on the backs of these brakes did not look like they wanted to fit without using a bit of excessive force. I would go for the bosch quietcast brakes if you're shopping for the 323is.
B007FGR852|5|Good quality product for the money, considering I couldn't afford $180 for the ness and especially I fitted this drag fairing to my 08 streetbob completely different front end than what it was designed to fit! No special mods to make fit just bent the mount a little and drilled 1 hole in upper tree it is possible to fix all newer model dynas with midglide/wideglide front end 49mm
B00B8X3JPQ|5|These worked perfectly and look great! Best choice over problematic LED's
B00W8DBZQU|4|Just what I expected. Arrived early
B0012Q9BOC|5|Great buy,for the cost, you get a good jacket,,,for sure will buy from them again, great  shipping fast and perfect.
B000E3VHVO|5|The resonator is compact and well made.  The stubs are 1.5&#34; long ,which provide adequate length for adjustment.  My original setup (header, test pipe, unresonated cat-back exhaust) was loud and raspy.  After replacing the test pipe with the resonator, the mid rpm rasp was virtually eliminated and the low/mid rpm sound levels were significantly lowered.  The top end noise level still seemed loud but actually went down by over 6 dB when measured at an autocross event.
B000JZWMSO|2|bought this and brought to my mechanic to install.  He strongly discouraged me from installing this saying the quality is poor.  A lot of it is molded plastic with seams that are weak.  Spend the money for an OEM radiator.
B011MEJILY|5|Perfect details
B000CPCRJK|2|I've used this in the past, but this time the nozzle on the can just wouldn't work.<br /><br />5 star product, just got a bad can.
B000MK2VB4|5|The fit and finish is very good.  The edges are deburred and the inside diameter is beveled on one side.
B000X25YGA|4|Weather tech always has nice products. This too is outstanding
B0052SF0LO|1|The light I purchased only lasted a few days. the motion sensor stopped working.<br />very cheap product.
B00CMJC2H6|5|the remote shell was what they said it would be
B007HGF29Y|5|Works great with the fantastic fan. The smoke did darken up the bathroom but all of my rooftop items are black so I kept up with the theme. Be aware you &#34;will&#34; have to remove 4 screws from the roof flange and install new longer ones so you will need roof sealer to install.
B0024E6UE0|5|Fit was good just had to trim for the refer drain hose
B00407YQ36|1|I purchased BNS0601 which does say on the label it is a &#34;perfect match&#34; for color code K23. On my 2012 Altima, it turned out to be a pretty terrible match, honestly. It's much darker, looks a good bit more gray than the surrounding silver. Here are the details of my experience...  I bought it to paint a bowling ball sized section on my rear bumper that got scuffed up. I cleaned the area properly and sanded the area smooth with 800 grit. I cleaned again, taped off the area and sprayed some dupli-color primer (because I had scuffed down to the bare bumper material in a few spots.) I waited the prescribed amount of time and then topcoated with the BNS0601. The paint sprayed very well and covered evenly after 3-4 light coats. I then waited the prescribed amount of time and sprayed the dupli-color clear. When I pulled the tape off, I was shocked at how poorly it matches. My wife is driving it out of town for a few days and when she gets back I'll try to blend it a bit with some fine grit paper and rubbing compound, but I'm expecting it to still look worse than the scuffed up look I started with. I'll update my review accordingly and add a picture.  UPDATE: Here's what it looked like after I buffed and rubbed on it. Not too good. I ended up purchasing a pre-painted aftermarket bumper online for $250.
B0002RNSLO|5|Great product.  Does the trick for sure.
B00VGL8LZS|5|As advertised
B00IDSIC1U|1|Only got 2 of the 10 lights. Was charged for all of them.
B00HS5HECC|5|Nice
B00A7EU81A|5|Great tool
B000IYSKAK|5|Replaced myself and saved $$$. Fit perfectly, great price.
B0041EDM6U|5|Best MTL for manual gearboxes that use relatively light oil (eg SAE 30 engine oil) or ATF (such as the LT77 or R380 Land Rover gearboxes). Not for the axles or the LT230 transfer case.
B00TI5EKWC|5|Got this for a while and haven't got a chance to use it till now, and can't believe it works so well and easy!!!!!
B00D1S0KK8|5|Installed this hitch on our 2015 Subaru Forester.  It fits great, is secure, and was easy to install with all the hardware included.  Look at getting curt # 56040 if you want the plug and play wiring harness.<br /><br />This hitch is sold and is made in the USA, I cant think of a single reason to go with any competitor, this is the best value by far!
B0013RLL1G|1|One clip works great, the other clip does not hold the button in.  This light out clip did not work for me.
B00O3GYZUI|2|Can barely see them
B00TDM65PU|5|Perfect for my Harley
B00OZVOHTK|1|Came on time. However after install check engine light came back on. Had to diagnose and found pressure sensor hoses where on backwards. This is second review. I have had to replace Dorman charcoal canisters with factory!!!!!! I highly recommend you do not buy this product!!!
B00WXJ4N68|2|Cute ..but nor worth price and not made out of wood..it's rubber plastic....definitely  not worth $$$$
B005NLCGF8|5|So my BF spent $145 on one of these...  I bought this one and used the free torque app and I have more features and it connected very easily to my nexus 5.  This is a perfect example of a great idea that doesn't need to be over priced to be effective!  I know nothing about cars... I recently had to have all of my tires changed because I was waiting for a notification to put air in my tires...  For 7 months...  This is a great way for the less car savvy to feel comfortable and gain knowledge into how their car actually operates.  And being able to look up codes before talking to a mechanic -so I have an actual clue as to what they are saying:  PRICELESS!!  I highly recommend.  And the fact that I didn't go the retail route like my car guy BF... BONUS!<br />2005 VW Passat GLX Wagon
B0012PR59G|5|Worked out great fixing a/c in car.  Did the work myself and saved my money by not having to take car in for repairs.
B00COE3ZHA|5|Buying a replacement rear blade from the dealer is expensive,  and hard to find anywhere else. This fit perfect and was inexpensive.
B00HCVRPY4|4|works as it should.
B001LHVOVK|5|Just as expected,great product
B00E39VZ2G|5|Exact fit. Buy it when you replace clutch in your YJ
B0060A753E|2|Ordered theses to fit 2004 range rover. Wrong size, do not fit...too small
B000CNGWR0|3|They performed very good and add some hp & mpg however, I replaced them after 40,000miles and one of the came out with the ceramic briken and nowhere to be found. Possibly with a broken valve because some of the metal crown went with it.<br />It does give you power but I have to be honest about my situation.<br />Good luck!
B00AMMCE3C|1|Only received 3 of the 4 floor mats.
B00BLZ93T2|2|Poor quality control here.  Had to return and reorder this twice before I got a unit that worked.  The first one did not power on at all.  The second one did not power on with the added bonus of becoming very hot on one of the components.  Finally, on the third try I got a working unit.  Luckily Amazon has a good return policy, but was a big headache to order, test, reorder, repackage the defective pieces and drive to the mail store multiple times.
B00FXSHCR8|5|worked for my sv650s
B00FVZCNRC|4|Fit my 3.0l Mercruiser fine
B001B5E0N6|5|Completed w/ a new flywheel and the operation was great.  Customer was very pleased.
B00CAVN9BO|5|Fits well, excellent part.
B007CNDOSI|1|Did not work on my vehicle.
B004KJ6KFG|5|Fits like a charm on a 2&#34; hitch.  Very secure.
B001JT77K2|5|Good for camping or disaster preparedness.
B002ZTGQF2|5|concern whether the holes will go exactly to the stud in the carpet... no worry, it's like my car was there when they made the liner.
B002INP6QU|1|to hard to turn, most women can not use this jack
B00EA2VW9M|5|Whoop whoop! You have no idea how excited I am that I got these at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I'm obsessed with zebra print. Almost every gift I get from friends and family has some kinds of zebra print. These plastic licence plate covers are the perfect upgrade to personalize your vehicle without breaking the bank. They were shipped in a bunch of bubble wrap and large bag. So they were super safe during shipping. They are made out of a durable plastic, so they're going to last a long time. Installation is super easy, a child could do it. They fit perfectly and make my car look amazing. I'm so in love!
B00EPRNEWK|3|Fittings good Tubing had to be bent to fit.
B00MDG14CC|5|Super bright and very good looking
B001TGLF7Q|5|I receive my ss wing spoiler from jsp. And im so happy. Makes my sedan cobalt look even more sporty.
B001DKO3X6|5|Works well!
B00A7WIVNE|5|Perfect fix! Looks like a stock factory Jeep piece.
B000OWXRAY|5|I got this to use on my sons Nintendo ds but also used it for watches, small toys, and my heart rate monitor. It comes with a small organizing case to keep all of your bits organized. I really need to purchase another as I have since lost most of the bits due to a son who likes to take things apart. I have no idea where he gets that from :)
B006L92R2S|4|Product Exactly as Promised !
B00HHGRJZE|5|Detroit Axle is the best. decent pricing, great quality products, easy to deal with.  I'm glad I found you guys on Amazon. I'm a return customer.
B00BITQ4UM|5|great product
B00B6X7PGM|5|Worked great for my lawn mower
B00EC0Y8Y8|4|Not an exact replacement, no auto dimmer and a thinner bezel. You can see the missing wire in my photo otherwise a good replacement. Needed some tweaks too. The terminals for heat were thinner and I had to pinch the wire terminal to get a tight fit. I also had to pull the two metal clips from my old mirror I believe they are anti vibration clips not essential but very helpful. I'm glad I did not dispose of my broken mirror before the new one arrived. I also had to tilt the adjusting mechanism all the way down and stick a screwdriver behind to hold it out firmly enough to get the mirror to snap in completely.
B00SZ3FCJS|5|I've had it on the truck for several months now with no issues. Delivery was ahead of schedule.
B000EGZ5FK|5|great
B00PHTXWQS|5|incredibly bright. brighter then the original 40 watt white incandecent it replaced. you have to install your own resistor to stop 'fast blink'.
B000816KNC|5|The goggles are PERFECT for anyone's kiddos who don't like to get their eyes or nose wet! Great/comfortable fit! Easy to get on and off =)
B0051SEKLQ|5|Works awesome
B00M7GSERQ|5|Heavy duty and fits fine
B000VB2U9C|2|Nice radiator... BUT! This does not fit the cars it says it does! Could be amazons fault... idk its getting returned. Said it would fit an 08 chevy malibu V6 LS and the radiator has to be upside-down to line up with the tranny hook ups. Which would work... if the inlet was at the bottom.
B002SRVX9U|5|Velcro polishing pad holder. Yay
B00CEX5C9K|5|Excellent tool works very well I highly recommend this product.
B00116SGVM|5|Works great. Bought this for my boyfriend and he says he is so glad he has it.
B0075ZHLIM|3|It's decent for the price. At under $100, I didn't expect much. Only reason for return was that it was a little too big. If it had fit, I'd probably have kept it.
B000BZIFV0|5|perfect for my honda.
B004ILVAOM|5|Perfect
B00CBR5D16|5|looks and feel great!
B0041CDPQO|5|good

B00RUYGEIQ|5|Great quality parts easy to communicate with will do biz with them again.thanks
B001LMWQ44|5|Great product!
B000765MHI|2|I liked that this fan has variable speed control. However, the on/off control dial isn't really held on by anything and popped off on the second use. I opened the plug up and used some epoxy to glue it in place. So far, so good. If it pops off again, I'll probably just wire it so that it's always on.
B00CLMBE5A|1|Arrived after 17 days, as you see it here with a sticker label and NO MOUNTING HARDWARE.
B000ALG0KS|5|High-quality product at about half the cost of what it would've been at AutoZone. Highly satisfied.
B0082CTSOM|1|Quality looks good, but didn't fit.
B00OO9AS9G|5|Happy with my purchase thank you
B00BT1UNR4|4|fast shipping very well described and packaged

B0117VJ7AY|5|Works great in my 2014 Toyota Tundra.
B007C3CP7Y|5|Heavy Duty. Well made
B00IK3UOZK|5|Fit perfectly on my license plate holder. Always displays the same picture and message. I couldn't ask for more.
B00K35F5XO|5|I bought this pump to transfer hydraulic oil and it works great for that ,Better than expected
B00BTLIAVK|5|Worked great.  Quality was A+
B003M0WRIS|1|Told me they would fit me Nissan Rogue and they didn't waste of money I don't care how cheap they was they didn't fit 
B0009OR94M|5|Work great
B004G53TJ4|4|The signal switch is a decent replacement switch it did fix my problem so I'm happy with the product.
B00KYB0AGE|1|Does not work with Yamaha as advertised...screws are too small and fall through the windshield...Tried to return, but they expect me to pay return shipping costs that are about the same as I paid...very unhappy...
B0013FBU8M|5|It's a cap it screws on
B000HEBR3I|5|this is the best invention
B000182DW4|5|Easy to install and fit great on my 2002 Tundra SR5!
B00K069YCO|1|Broken when I got it not very happy :(
B0034256FA|2|Did not fit my motorcycle.
B000EDUTWM|4|Excellent product.  We have several in our RV.
B00K2SLS7O|4|Fits perfect !! looks great!! Just wish it had a none slip bottom!! I remedied that by inverting a rubber back carpet so items don't slide around and rattle in the storage holder.
B002R0YCMS|5|Should have replaced this years ago. Two Phillips screws and done.
B009OOOA68|5|Work great fit my 92 ultra glide
B00CO8WD9C|5|Great price and item.
B008MISCLQ|5|Good oil.  Good price.

B003XVHONO|5|Good quality, easy fit.
B00J2MCOX8|5|dont burn i actually had to epoxy them but its alright they dont burn off the exhaust which is perfect
B00CKKFDPA|5|Awesome product fast shipment
B00HFDC8EQ|5|Wired right into my 2012 Tundra fog light harness and used OEM replacement bulb. Perfect.
B00S1OD8EM|5|Really bright
B00E2UMX40|5|Kit was accurate and exactly as described- all Ford OEM. I was pleasantly surprised to see much of the stock come from a local Houston Ford dealer. I was missing one of the timing cover gaskets but I cannot be positive it wasn't somehow lost. I did not call the Seller as there was no time and it was only a $10 item. But check your invoice/packing list against the items in the box when it arrives as many are small items easily lost.
B00UZSZ692|5|Great product reasonable price fast shipping
B00B6X7PGM|5|We had a old Murrary 20in 3.5HP up at the cabin that I thought was ready for the scrap bin.  Installing this new and using STP for oil fixed everything, runs like new.  Even sharpened the blade!  I would install a new carb before doing a rebuild, it was easy.
B00THR0GRO|5|Installed easily and fit perfectly
B000CO9V0E|5|I put this on my 2004 Honda accord coupe 2.4L. Right once the air intake was installed, my car had a little more power, increased fuel economy and a loud deep tone when you fit the gas hard. I normally get around 25mpg where i live and once it was installed, i now get 28mpg, so it will pay for itself. And since its a cold intake, the engine running temperature is lower, which saves gas so that is also good. If you have the money for it, buy it, it is a very smart purchase.
B009EG8CME|5|lover very good
B003TP7JBQ|5|Fits BMW 530xi 2006.
B002EZZ8Y2|5|Great product, The wide rear view mirror clip on is distortion free, am returning for the wider mirror, I ,have a large Dog and Windows have Shades on the back and sides so I want the longer version,! This is a Great Clip on wide Rearview mirror! Thank you, Tess
B007G9A3WI|4|Great decal... I love when you order a red decal and you get it and it's ACTUALLY red vinyl vs. white with red burnt onto it.. This decal will last much longer in the sun than other decals I've bought from other sellers on here.
B004H78NQ0|5|These fit my 2000 323ci convertible and were easy to screw on.  Really adds some class to my Bemer!
B005B0YMIU|1|Poor made product had issues with the shift falling through the purple collar cant drive with it contacted the seller and all they would do is help file a mfg warranty poor customer service ....dont buy
B00E1SKAW0|5|They work like a charm and were easy to install the best part was I ordered them on a Sunday, they shipped on Monday, and I had them on Tuesday by the time I got home from work.
B010GQ9OHC|5|About what i expected. They couldve come with more thorough directions as this was my first time installing seat covers and had no idea what i was doing but it doesnt take much to figure it out.
B005MZYLN0|5|Wife loves it
B0065N6BG8|4|the decal sort of split/cracked after a few months of wearing, but only on one, not on both.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Works great! Planning to order another set for my sister as a gift.
B001KS6GIG|2|Put in a 2004 Silverado after putting in LED bulbs in the front signals.  Worked fine until I put LED bulbs in the rear also then the flasher won't cycle.  I will still have to put resistors on the rear so if I had known this I would not have ordered this.
B00092893E|3|Honestly I do not know if this item had any effect on my car.  My gas mileage was better, but only for the first tank of gas after using the product.
B0009TUGUG|5|great
B00MIHIYVA|5|Thank you.
B00L3KDUD0|4|These are great. They hold a lot of water and a lot of suds which helps keep my wheels clean. The only problem is the smallest one doesn't fit in between my wheel and break caliper which I was hoping it would. I have a 2012 base model v6 mustang. Maybe when I buy new rims it will fit but for now it doesn't which is annoying. Overall, definitely recommend these!
B00IKKS4W8|5|work well
B002N5YDG2|5|What a difference it made.  GREAT item
B002EX3YWM|5|can't wait to try it
B003ODOJSO|5|Better than expected.
B0009JKI8G|5|This is the 2nd I've bought of these - 24&#34; fits perfectly on my old E320 Merc. -<br />I live in Florida, it lasts me around a year, even in the intense sun (car outside all year) - I normally change it out early in the summer to be most effective for the rainy season - that way if it starts to break down 11 months later it will be during the dry season.
B00NPIUFMM|5|Used these in a 2004 Silverado for DRLs and they look really good.  Would work great for reverse lights too.
B0042HJ93Q|5|Part installed easily and fixed the concole
B0049CGJAU|2|Does not fit so good
B007RW2WUU|3|It was a bit big for a 2012 Hyundai Tuscon.  My husband had trouble squeezing it in.
B000Q0TYFG|5|Installed on my 2000 Honda Civic Si em1, and they've lowered the ride about 2.5 inches. I had to take the strut assembly to a local shop for compressing the top strut mount and installing the springs/dampers into the assembly, but the rest me and my father in law did. Heads up if you are installing on an older Civic like I did, be prepared for the lower control arm bolts to be rusted fast and have to cut them out like we did lol. I ended up just replacing the LCAs with a pair of Skunk2 ones while we were doing this project because of that.<br /><br />The ride with these is awesome. Highly recommend.
B00BD4NN24|5|Great grill, just what my 2002 ram needed.
B002P8HJTK|5|Arrived on time in minimal yet sturdy packaging.  Installation took about 15 minutes.  It fit very well on my 2006 Ford Fusion with only a very slight gap between the top of the mirror and the car.  Electrical connection was easily and snugly snapped into the existing wiring.  Mirror direction, puddle lamp and defroster all worked like the original.  The mirror shipped with a separate black cap but I utilized the cap from the old mirror to match the color of my other mirror.  It too snapped in easily with a perfect fit. This was an advantage over other similar mirrors that did not include a separate cap in that I could choose between the two to best fit my needs.  Price including shipping is 50% less than using a Ford branded mirror.  Amazon had great pricing compared to other vendors.
B0000UUX34|5|Fit perfect - 1/2 as thick as original filter & more efficient
B00NLROMFS|5|They worked excellent!!!
B00AQ2D568|5|This is how a bike should be transported!  Both wheels are held securely and weight of the bike is supported by the wheels.  I've loaded everything from my 29er mtb to triathlon bikes to a kid's bike with 20&#34; wheels.  Nothing moved.  Having the ability to split the carrier into two separate racks works perfectly for us.  I can haul two or four bikes behind my van or two bikes behind my impala.  This worked very well for us to take a weekend trip out of state to ride bikes.  Our road bikes never budged during the nearly 800 mile round trip.  There are videos online showing this carrier being driven over a test track.  Compared to the other styles of carriers, the only thing more solid is a roof type mount that the bicycle forks mount into.
B000BOK1EA|1|Poor quality bent didn't fit. Product is bad.
B00RPN1NFQ|5|Fixed my charging issue with my 1996 sea doo. Worked great
B00B0Z16O8|5|This fits perfect for 2005 Dodge Durango Limited. My vehicle has a tan/beige interior and this is a gray/dark grey part. But, I don't care about stuff like that. I couldn't find the tan one anywhere online and I didn't want to order through the dealer. This part came from dealer stock, however.<br /><br />For anyone that attempts to replace this part on their own, leave the white plastic clip that connects the metal rod to the lever in place and connect the rod to the lever with the clip attached to the lever. Do not put the clip on the rod, then try to shove it through the hole on the lever.<br /><br />As far as the screws go, they mount the bracket directly into the metal supporting the dash. Using a #2 phillips head could, and mostly will strip the screw heads. Use a 9/32 socket for a less frustrating experience.
B004XYRP9I|5|Great OEM replacment!
B00C0XCHKG|5|I purchased this for my 1990 cherokee xj, this stabilizer came with plenty of hadware and even instructions the bolt seems a bit long but otherwise everything was flawless and this thing is smooth seems as if its a bit beefier then the stocker too!
B007Q10TES|5|As described. Thank you for selling this product.
B000CC4O58|5|Installed them but don't know how good they work.
B002JV0W74|5|Very good camaro front window shade.
B001GJ3FIS|1|These things aren't worth the very low price I paid for them. Half the water dribbles out the side. Like it's missing a gasket or something. Took one apart to see what's wrong but didn't see what I could do to remedy the situation.<br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
B00AFEBYNI|5|I love these gloves! The only complaint is while riding, my throttle fingers kinda go numb because gloves are snug when fingers are bent. After I break them in hopefully they won't do this! Love the way they look and are made great!
B000KZ1WL6|5|It works great. Programming it was difficult but Google helped alot.
B002P8CWI8|5|Item arrived as advertised. Perfect fit.
B00SSKUHAC|5|Fits perfectly into the console of a 2015 Toyota Tundra SR5 CrewMax.
B000JKF2UY|5|Item exactly as described. Fit my truck perfect! Fast shipping.
B009FU7ELE|5|Good price and quality part
B0096GI9WA|4|Its good
B00EYK50UC|2|Doesn't handle heat inside of hid projector light.  This was a blue color at one time.
B0034ZUZM6|5|Excellent winch, well made and easy to use, I would recommend this winch.
B002UZEC9I|5|Easy to replace. Work as well as the OEM filters.
B00CZEQ8Z0|5|This was a bday present from my husband. I love. It's very loud.
B0007N5758|5|Great brush, works much better than the blue and green scrub pads I used to use..The price seems a bit high no that it's in hand. It does do better than i expected
B000P17NXQ|5|As I expected
B001ROPMKQ|5|Perfect fit.  Go Giants!
B001SLEPB0|5|Adds just that touch of class.
B00BTKWQ3O|3|One bulb burnt out the first time it was used.
B00O2JYO7U|4|Love it
B00EQMOBKI|5|These brake pads and rotors were easy to put on, are very quiet and have great stopping power. Thing is the first time I had purchased brake parts online or the Callahan brand and when my van needs new brakes I will buy these exact ones again. Just a note. Remember to buy that brake pad lubricant to grease everything up when your job. This kit doesn't include it. I bought these for a 2002 Dodge Grand Caravan Sport with 236,000 miles on it and it probably stops better now than when it was brand new.
B00GOW6V5Q|4|The tank cover was everything that I expected easily assembled and fit perfectly over my 30# tanks on my trailer. The access covers allow easy access to turn on/off the tank valves. Comment on construction; it would be great if the material was not quite as brittle I accidentally dropped it off the workbench while assembling the unit, causing a small piece of the flange to break off.
B001810SHA|5|great product. did exactly what it was designed to do, and for half the cost of the stores around my neighborhood
B002BVXM92|5|Excellent  product  and good price. .
B00X122XPO|5|I have a 2002 Honda Odyssey EX-L. I stick to a rigorous detailing routine that includes leather cleaning and conditioning. I was using Armorall leather cleaner and conditioner, which worked fine. However, the spray was lacking on the conditioning/protecting aspect. I would have to use the spray once a week to keep the leather supple. The summer sun on Oahu can be intense and although the van spends its home time in a covered carport, during the working hours it sits in a asphalt parking lot that reaches 93 degrees F. I found that the leather creme by Nanoskin works wonders to restore the natural, new feel of the leather while outlasting the Armorall. The best part is this formula works great on vinyl surfaces and really restores that showroom shine of the dash and trim. 3 weeks after the first application, the interior looked like it had been detailed that day. The scent also resurrects that 'new car' aroma, leaving you completly satisfied and content with your detailing job. The price is great too, considering you do not have to use it every week or every other week. It has been a month since I used it last and if I was not so obsessive it could last another month. Bottom line: Great Price Great Protection Great smell Great versatility Thanks Nanoskin
B00SWGPT14|3|It is a relatively good car cover. However if you are purchasing it for a 2015 vw passat tdi, it will not completely covered your vehicle. So be forewarned.
B007QBT64C|5|Fit perfectly in my 2008 GMC Sierra with 6.0 engine! Cost less than some remanufactured starters from my local auto parts stores.<br />Highly recommended.
B00EVMT6A8|5|Works amazing, perfect size for my car side views. Great view on it.
B00KNGBICU|5|great price on this bundle
B00AKFB4B4|1|Item is mislabeled.<br />They are 12x1.5 lug nuts and they damaged my car.
B000W0MOD4|5|This thing is awesome.  No having to carry around extra keys and the tumblers won't rust as bad as you can take apart the combination portion and clean it out.
B007Q7SYT4|5|Fit well. Make sure you adjust the center and check to make sure the shocks aren't hitting your tie rod or any other steering/suspension component.
B004LF3HQO|3|It's over priced and does the same thing as a $3.00 can of brake clean
B010N7RW2S|5|I think it's a product worth having in your car for those just in case situations for daily use. And if you're on a road trip, then it's upgraded from worth having to must have. It really covers a lot of functions in this device.<br />First of all, it's a jump starter. Most other compact jump starters in the market delivers 400A max peak current. They work for sure, work pretty well actually. With this one, it delivers 200A more to a whopping 600As. It gives you a lot more cushion room in situations like cold weather, battery completely dead, or handling bigger engines. I test it with V4 2.4L, V6 3.2L and V8 5.0L. In all cases, left the car light on overnight, comes morning I turn the lights off and confirm battery won't start the car. Then wait for about 30 mins for battery to build up some surface charge on its own before I tried to jump start with Anker jump starter. All 3 cars started successfully. I'm in NoCal, temp is about 65F in the morning.<br />2. It's got a small flash light. Not much, but it's good to have and its LED. I imagine in emergency situations, with its 15000mah built in battery, it will last this led light for a long long time.<br />3. 2 Power IQ power on the side up to 2.1A/ port. When needed, you'll have some back up charging power, though I'd recommend for hiking or other outings, get one of those solar chargers.<br />4. Anker was nice enough to include a car charge adapter, a wall adapter as well as a micro USB cable. Essentially all the accessories you need is included in the package which is kinda nice.<br />If you're a road warrior, college kid with a not so reliable car, definitely get one.
B00KZCM4EI|5|Good quality for the price, fit perfect on my 2011 Ram crew cab. It took me about 1hour to install, no problems.
B00EKTIBKS|5|This really made a great new look for my truck!
B0049Z8X4C|1|Key ring broke  2 days after using it.
B000MK5M60|5|Nice drink holder. Does what it is supposed to do.<br />Requires a flat surface to mount and 2-4 screws hold it in place.<br />Does not work with mugs with handles but great for water bottles or cans.
B00FWOKJYG|5|Very responsable seller. Full recomended *****<br /><br />Thanks a lot.<br /><br />Regards
B002G47GE6|5|I've had a lot of cars in my life, and changed alot of wiper blades.  These were by far the easiest I've ever had to change.  Perfect fit for my 2012 Jetta Sportwagon.
B00KTJ9Z5S|1|Advertised compatible with 2005 Honda Accord, these keys have the chip integral to the button module unlike the factory originals which have it in the shell. They failed to program.
B008BTLB1O|5|exactly as advertized
B002SINC02|5|Perfect for the unpredictable weather of soccer games!!  Got one for each car.
B00NI1T6QM|5|Exact fit
B000LVIM8K|5|very nice
B00PVE93P8|5|It was what it was promised to be and was shipped quickly.
B001JT5OGG|4|Just started to use it in my classic convertible and does the job in keeping my back cool.
B00J4HLNC4|5|They Are Great. It Makes It Easy To See In Front Of You.
B00BNVK2TE|5|recommended for a Ford F53 chassis. I use it on my Motorhome many people use the wrong fluid in their motorhomes this is what you need.
B0009ZEVJC|5|Easy to install, Fram makes quality products, felt very durable.
B00080QHMM|5|I an pleased with this gauge and its operation.
B0043AV4NK|5|I got too admit i was a bit nervous about ordering this muffler for a low price but i was surprized in the quality of this muffler it came in the mail pretty fast  nd in good condition ..i would def buy another one if i had too great product.
B007NPZESI|3|The carpet is shedding and mats are a little thin!
B002DPHDF0|5|It was almost exact as to the one I was replacing. Couldn't of been any better!
B0031I209W|5|Great product keeps my CBR 900 from getting wet. Never had any problems with it flying off.
B001C6Q7US|5|Works fine
B00MGD5PVI|5|Great boots for the cash
B00FGVXC8A|5|A+
B0028U1CKW|5|This kit is awesome. I have been using the kit for a long time on all of my vehicles. The kit is very high quality.
B00BTLEIIY|5|Subaru just good!
B007EEVIR4|5|great product
B0076H3304|5|Great product
B00CJIXAYO|5|Great
B001BCJX1S|5|Perfect fit, you can't even tell it was replaced. Very happy with product and price.  Thank you
B006H33ZEC|5|best lights I've used, will be buying a set of spot lights next or maybe a light bar. awesome lights
B007U2ALW8|5|The Nelson Rigg Can Am RT Spyder Half Cover worked like a charm.  It fit my bike like a glove and came down below the seat keeping everything clean and dry.  Best investment ever.
B010N7RW2S|1|I purchased this jump starter after reading the mostly positive reviews.  I have an older car with a 2.4L 4 cylinder engine.  It failed to start one night and I had it jumped so I could drive home.  I ordered this jump starter to have in case I needed it.  The next time I went to drive the car, it wouldn't start.  I used my Innova Digital Multimeter to test the battery before I jumped it.  It read between 8-9 volts so it wasn't completely dead.  My jump starter was fully charged.  It did start the car but went all the way down to 3%.  I plugged it in to charge and it charged back up to about 25% and then jumped all the way to 100%.  This took less than an hour when it should have taken several hours to charge.  I didn't try to use it again until the next weekend and I must have left it on because it was completely dead.  I read in another review that it's supposed to turn itself off but I didn't see that in the manual so I don't know if that's a feature.  I then charged it to about 40%.  The manual says it needs to be at least 25%.  I tested the battery again and it was still reading between 8-9 volts but the jump starter couldn't start the car.  I emailed Anker support to see if it was working as it should.  They replied quickly asking for some additional information and stated that the stand behind their product and would refund my purchase price or replace the product if necessary.  I went ahead and initiated a return with Amazon as I have no confidence this jump starter will work in an emergency.  At the time of this posting there are 11 reviews with &#34;verified purchase.&#34;  Of those reviews 5 are 1 star, two are 4 star and four are 5 star for an average score of 3.    At the time of this posting there are 12 reviews from people that received a free sample to use and write a review.  All 12 of those individuals gave the product 5 stars.  It seems like those who actually purchased the product aren't as happy with it as those who got a free one or purchased it from somewhere else.
B00VZL3CA8|5|All good
B009KP77WU|1|Wrong conector for my car. Had to contact Curt for the right one
B004QEF970|5|Fits like a gem in my new 2&#34; Curt receiver and looks great too.
B001P20QDS|5|So many different options and settings, I live this thing for fuel milage, power, torque, and all around looks for the truck!! Great product.
B00B2A2DAC|5|Great service, fast delivery, works perfect. Thank you.
B004ZQV478|5|Perfect fit on my fx35, The outer joint end is bigger. only 30 miles on it so far, great product.
B007FHBYJC|5|Used on Toyota Rock Crawler to upgrade after doing rear disc brakes. Wanted factory toyota but way to much $$$, ADVICS is AISIN anyway so this worked great.
B000C2WKC2|5|Perfect fit, good quality, and best price that I could find.
B00WDSVEE8|3|I love the flip up feature of this product. You don't have to take it on and off when you walk indoors (e.g. shopping, etc.). However I wish I could find it in a smaller size. The bottom touches my face so I need to push my glasses up occasionally.
B001Y91MFI|4|Cheap but worth the cheap price.
B000BGHYLG|5|Awesome, love them. I like the white light better than the incandescent yellow. Very cool to the touch.
B006QLN9F0|5|Easy and simple to replace and cheaper than a FORD Dealership one
B000F2MB7S|5|I bought this to cover my dash which had started to crack.  It looks great.  After a few days in my truck it molded itself to my dash perfectly.  It stays in place with the windows down driving at highway speeds as well.
B0016KHD8A|5|A snap to install and seems to work well. No issues when hooking up the fifth wheel and didn't notice any problems when driving.
B0009JKI86|5|works well
B0079SG4HY|5|Works great in our 1998 Caravan 3.0. After a bit of a struggle during DIY installation, it worked great. Very nice product.
B005R0HJIO|4|Bought it to replace the stock one in my 4dr jeep wrangler 2010 after it started making noises and shutting off.  I'm happy with it, it does make more noise then stock one, but at least it doesn't shut off by itself. The power plug is a hybrid, instead of being built into the housing it hangs by wires out side it (still works just dangles a little low, but a zip tie fixes that).<br /><br />By it being louder I mean it sounds like a small fan nothing terribly loud. Your music will more than likely cover it up.
B008BLFHS0|5|Cool works good
B00EB03YEE|4|It fits the window perfectly. It is nice and insulated. It does help keep my car a tad cooler in the hot Florida sun. I'm sure in a less hot climate it would help even more. All in all does what it's supposed to.
B005DJRDDK|4|quick shipping and quick installation
B00SK4BX0Y|5|Very good
B00K36QNUM|5|Fits great!
B000BOZVW2|3|I used it in my toyota matrix, fitted perfectly. However the mirror shakes with every bump on the road, even while pressing the gas, causing blurry vision. Something, i could not stand...3 stars for the lights and the easy fit.
B00LLNWT36|4|Great frame, useless caps.  It will obscure any words at the bottom of the plate, e.g., The Empire State, or Famous Potatoes, etc.
B006MDH5J8|5|Use this on a utv for pulling logs out. Very high end, you will be impressed at the quality and function.
B00199N4CW|5|Product as described and met my needs
B009IPRPFQ|5|Highly satisfied with the product, ease of installation and support. Great work. thanks
B002G3Z7PC|1|The blades were easy to install on my 2007 BMW 335i sedan, fit well and performed fine for a while. That's the good part. Now the bad -- I've only had them installed for about a month, and now that we've had a hard rain, I can say that I'll be replacing these blades quickly. They chatter like a drunk monkey when they run more than a couple of back-and-forth cycles, and I'm very disappointed with the performance given the fairly high price. I cannot in good conscience recommend these blades, even though they seem to work fine for others given the overall high approval score.
B0000AXE6C|5|Works good on my farm diesel pumps.
B00QNQOVC8|5|Awesome! At first I thought &#34; no way this thing is going to hold me&#34; I tied the provided ropes tight. Sat in it. A little popping of the knots tightening up. Then pure enjoyment. I plan on this being my camping hammock. All I need now is properly spaced trees! If positioned right I can practically cocoon myself in the material. I had my 5 year old jump on with me and still fine. Over 200lbs and still chilling! My only concern would be it ripping from my gun holster( camping). Besides that pressing your hand into the material to get out feels firm, not like it's going to rip through.
B003AT6EYO|5|This is a keeper.
B00KTITCRU|1|It stop working after about a week and a half change battery and still nothing even reprogram it and nothing
B00NFW6M4S|4|nice clean scent. just wished it lasts longer. I've only had this for a month or so and the gel is already shrunk super tiny. will have to purchase another soon :/
B007MI5SDW|5|Exactly what my husband was looking for.  Mounting of the rack box was easy and it stays tightly locked even after some very bumpy rides
B00DRZXRO6|5|It works just fine as advertised. Amazon comes thru again!😀
B0063CUZ3Q|4|received quick and is what is advertized.  installation a breeze
B0093A9UA4|4|I think the fitment could of been a little better, the corners tend to curl up.
B00G8WLW2Y|5|Just what I need for ACC power on my ATV
B000EDOSQA|4|Good product.  I recommend at least two coats, which go on quickly and easily.
B00009PGNS|5|Have only used it once-in the heating mode and it lived up to everything I was expecting!
B004R36OV0|5|absolutely &#34;snapped&#34; in
B007SYIZVW|5|Durable. Perfect.
B0046KIABG|4|Not the brightest of lights but worked good enough to see the inside of my Ranger. I will say that of the two that I ordered both had one side of the Velcro strap that was stitched up where you couldn't put one side of the lights lip into it. Easy remedy was to cut the stitch that prohibited the lip going into the Velcro strap, after that it worked perfect.
B00LFL8HQ2|1|Bearing went bad in less than 5000 miles. I also tried contacting Dura customer service via email (info@duraintl.com) and they do not respond. For what it worth. Good luck with warranty claim.
B006ZLDXPM|5|Easy to adjust to get secondaries coming in just right.
B00N2983BO|5|Great quality
B00ON43CYK|4|I've bought a pair in the range of $30 on eBay and they have more detail and you can see the difference, but these are great for their price
B000AMXQDG|3|Doesn't dry completely and makes an eventual mess on rims
B00U2CDJV8|5|Bought this at Target for a penny under $100. My 2014 Honda died in their parking lot and I was in a bind. I was hesitant to buy due to the small size and price but took a chance. I went to the parking lot and hooked it up out of the box. My once dead Honda started up on the first try. I used it a few more times after that and again no issues. As I type this review on my IPhone it is plugged into the Cyntur.<br /><br />Given the size of this thing it is amazing. This thing fits in my pocket no problem and is the exact size of my IPhone 6 albeit thicker. No more lugging around those 10 pound battery chargers anymore. This thing will fit easily in the glovebox and says the charge on it will last a year. It comes with a case so its protected along with a wall charger to juice it up when its low. There is also a four light sequence on the charger which tells you how much juice it's got left.<br /><br />I would recommend this charger 100%.
B0053ZSGJ4|5|THANK ITS A WORHER
B008M7SVBS|1|I wanted the ones with the wrench key chain not one with allan wrench.
B009OBVRY4|3|It's a little disappointing, hard to get the right amount of force, and the liquid is inferior to other Meguiars liquids. You'd really have to do all three types of their liquids to really get a proper shine. Overall, I wouldn't buy it again if I had to do it over. But I'm committed, so I'll continue to use it.
B010SPPWMC|5|Very easy to install. Give my jeep a better look!
B00HTOB0NG|1|work sometimes but NOT all the times. Still waiting for replacement but no response from Kensun...  Hopefully by this Xmas 2015 get the replacement...
B0039VMSCU|5|I just installed this in my 2001 Tacoma 5vz-fe (3.4).  I have manual trans and AC.  All parts fit perfectly.  I did not use the crankshaft or camshaft seals as my old ones were not leaking.  I did not buy nor did I need the tensioner compressor that is  a &#34;recommended buy&#34; for this job.  The old tensioner can be removed without compressing.  However, if you pull the pin on the newly installed one and don't get your alignment right, you have to remove it and re-compress it in a vice.  I didn't need to do that because I got it right the first time. There are three marks on the timing belt.  Two markings are for the camshaft notches and the third, as best I can tell, marks the first tooth contacted on the left side (driver) of the driveshaft sprocket. Camshaft marks are not labeled left or right, but the belt shows a rotation direction for installation and the belt basically rotates clockwise as you face the engine. Rotate the engine at least one turn to confirm proper camshaft/driveshaft alignment.  It is important to know that the belt markings will not &#34;re-align&#34; after rotating once, but you must look for the camshaft and driveshaft markings to confirm proper align/installation.  In other words, looking at the belt makes it look like it is messed up but it probably is not...the camshaft and driveshaft sprokets are your confirmation! Lastly, the balancer pulley wrench that is a &#34;recommended buy&#34; would have been nice to have.  I ended up making my own from some nuts, bolts and a flat, steel strip I bought at Lowes. $7 for a homemade tool. One gallon of Pentofrost A1 antifreeze, diluted at 50/50 to make two gallons was all that was needed to refill the cooling system. Not a job for the timid or inexperienced, but I saved about $1,000 labor by doing it myself.
B009DK3OVA|5|It worked great.  The check engine light for this code stop as soon as it was installed.
B00JMCCGF4|4|Good
B00GWV32GU|4|I really like the pink with the black, and the style of this jacket but fit is not cut right for me. I had to contact Leather King by email to ask about a sizing chart, because there isn't one provided. I ordered 2 sizes bigger than I normally wear based on the chart they sent. It does somewhat fit me, I can put it on, I can zip it, the chest and hips/waist fit ok and will use it but due to the bigger size I needed to order to get chest and waist right size, the arms do not seem like they are sized properly, almost like there is too much material above my armpits to my neck if that makes sense, but I am sure if I had ordered a smaller size I would not get it zipped. Maybe because of the bigger chest size they assume you are also taller and have longer arms?, but I am average height and it  just looks a little odd if you are wanting a more tailored fit. I tried it without the sweater it comes with to see if that would help but it didn't, and other than the sweater this jacket is not lined on the inside making the texture a bit rough on bare arms. It is a very heavy jacket and would be perfect if the sizing was better.
B005O0UYD4|2|Cheap plastic, hope it lasts.
B009EV0XOO|5|I can see the road... yay
B00P1F6A94|5|what i needed
B012CQX8LC|5|Believe all the good things you hear about these lights! They are bright, don't flicker and are a nice pure white color. Installed these in place of the OEM backup lights in my Ford Edge and like them so well I've ordered the rest of the outside and inside LED's from Alla Lighting to keep the color the same and will review them as I get them installed.
B00R26RCVK|5|Great for keeping my grimy gym body away from the upholstered car seat in my wife's car!
B000FFF3GG|5|great product!
B00VAK1HHY|5|Love it!<br />Used on most windows in the house and keeps things much cooler!
B005JPJMI2|5|Very easy to use.  Does a good job.
B001JB8C0E|5|Great.
B005BNZGCS|5|Nice heavy duty plug. Good quality.
B001E0AK9Q|5|Perfect!!
B00AC6YT86|5|It's a bolt. It fit. Plain and simple. Got five stars because the black didn't come off during the tightening process
B000LY9ECA|4|Fits my 15 Toyota Tacoma Double Cab. Installations was very easy. After opening the box, it was installed within 20 minutes.
B000TYTS64|2|Didn't work. Returned it for full refund.
B00G4ATR54|5|Great price, quick shipping and works perfectly.  We are thrilled to be able to transport four adult bikes easily now.
B007TY0E1K|5|It was just what I orderd and works great
B0057FU9GI|5|As expected. A little noisy
B006PHX504|5|Delivers was on date you said . And it works great Thanks.

B00NB8TNXI|5|Way to brighten my truck up!!! These are really user friendly and the hype is real these lights are bright best bang for your buck I will purchase another set for my wife's car
B00LMNFBPI|5|Love it!
B0031741CW|5|Fit my KLR 650 great, easy install and very sturdy.
B00DL5LYQ0|1|Didn't fit the look I wanted....
B00R0TU2IO|5|This thing works great
B001EBHY5I|5|Bars were packaged very well.  Fit like a champ on my 2002 Suzuki Intruder Volusia (with original cables, by the way).  Love the style and look.  I highly recommend this to others looking to modify their bikes for a more comfortable ride.
B00G8S07FQ|2|Too small decals.
B0000AXQPA|1|It is not what the description says it is this product is going back
B002TS4Z98|2|Very poor quality. Label doesn't stick and from super slow shipping, waited 2 weeks just to find out. Also, the labels are too small.<br />Label material is not high quality. Ended up finding a recycle label image on the internet, printed it on a standard 8''x11'' piece of paper, cut the design out then spray painted the recycle label image on the recycle can.<br />Much better, bigger, permanent and more customized.
B006VWT4Z8|5|THEY LOOK GREAT ON MY 2003 BMW 325I . I GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME... SUPER EASY TO INSTALL !
B008X65VP2|5|Fits perfectly in my 2012 Mazda 3, just had to cut out the gas release opening which was no big deal.
B00YHZUVU8|4|Fits perfectly. A little cumbersome to roll up in the drivers seat.
B00JXAPELS|1|Ordered two sets from these and just absolute junk. Tried BOTH sets on THREE different vehicles and either one bulb wouldn't work or both would spaz out. I've had dozens of sets and these are by far worst
B005G04YE2|1|Doesn't come with a belt.
B00EBQX1OG|5|Nice
B0061RG7FI|2|great handles however the screws that were sent don't match the Toyota you have to use the existing hardware and you have to purchase screws from the local hardware store,
B00DMTTT8A|5|Everyone needs a pair of these if you want your vehicle to last years looking like new. Cant beat the prize and the fit is absolutely perfect. Much better than the ones offered from GM.
B000E65NHK|5|Perfect match
B007NJOEAI|5|Super GOOD
B000VT0I16|5|No problems
B00DR67P9I|4|great light, bright, great price
B00KBQWR5Y|5|Highly Recommended! Had a problem with a ballast about 6 months in and offered to replace, no problem.
B00RF95TDC|4|Great lug wrench, used it three times this past year! Works great, easier on your back than the cross lug wrenches or the one supplied with cars.  Same as the one sold at Autozone, Advanced Auto or O'Reilly. Bought a second for other car.
B004YEIRAI|5|SO COOL!!
B000GZQT9K|5|Came week earlier than expected!! Quality parts good price.
B002C0I9PY|4|I had a hard time looking for the perfect shade for my Prius. If you live in sunny area, it's definitely worth buying this!<br /><br />PROS<br />-Perfectly fits 2015 Prius<br />-Durable<br />-Easy to set and stay in place<br /><br />CONS<br />-Hard to roll<br />-Big
B00L9NKGSI|4|Arrived quickly and was a good fit and it feels like it added a few horsepower to the car, it definitely sounds better like it's sucking more air.<br />The only thing I would do to improve the customer satisfaction would be to include some sort of installation instructions for the not so mechanically inclined. There were parts left over that I couldn't figure where they went and that'a why I gave it a 4 star.
B000H961YI|5|I've been using this charger for a couple years now, charging and maintaining the batteries on 4 different vehicles. Two of them are not driven during the winter, so I switch the charger between them to keep there batteries charged during the cold and long snowy winters in Mid-Ohio. Needless to say this charger get a lot of usage and has performed flawlessly. I recently purchased a used trolling motor and it came with a year old deep cycle battery that had not been charged for at least a year. I connected the charger early on a Friday morning and it took almost 12 hours for the battery to come up to a full charge. Checked the battery with my volt meter and it was holding at 13.1 volts in it's maintain mode. Used it Sunday for three hours on the lake with the trolling motor without running out of juice.
B007S3KIDQ|5|love these
B000P17NXQ|5|Awesome for my car towing trailer
B00DQ5K0LA|5|Use it for pool chemicals like muratic acid and bleach. Great size and heavy enough for what i need. Great product.
B00267PZUK|5|I thought i totaled my F-150 with a wrench when i snapped off 6 of 8 spark plugs. This tool was awesome the only issues I had was user error(AKA make sure it is threaded all the way down or you can strip out spark plug threads). Cheap, efficient, and easy to use. Don't pull a cylinder if you have a shot of using this tool. The only downside is all the crap that falls down on top of the cylinder.
B00J55JHZA|5|A very good color match!
B0031HMS7C|5|Worked perfect on my 1999 Tacoma 2.4l
B00446AHWW|4|Great product. Good quality. Satisfied.
B000MMOJUS|5|The reel case and clips look weak but it last longer than I expected. I make sure I don't abuse it. It is not designed for heavy duty use but I managed to connect it to my Nokia Lumia 1020 cell phone. The short retract cable allows me to put my cell phone in my back pocket and prevent it from  crashing to hard ground directly when it fall off from my pocket, but yet long enough for me to answer phone calls without removing it from this keychain.  I also connect a laser pointer to the keychain but will buy another one of this key chain just for the laser pointer so that I don't need to remove the phone when I need to use the laser pointer. I have short memory and always forget where I put things just minutes ago. This retractable keychain help me to keep my phone and laser pointer with me during the day.
B00UHD4HJA|4|Pretty good pack, although I did receive some rather cheap ones.
B0007Y4P8W|5|Improves RV appearance and works good.
B00FRHQG2W|5|Worked great. Good value.
B00DM8N7R0|3|Ordered flat black.  Received gloss black.  Sticker was the size of a stamp.  Shipped from China and took two weeks. Not as picture showed.  Picture shows an overlay over the actual sticker to assist with locating in proper location. No overlay just a sticker on wax paper.  Line it up straight the first time!
B00KTR4T2Y|4|Sounds great in lower rpms, but rattles a bit when you push it. Had to bend all hangers so it wouldn't touch and rattle. Overall, definitely worth the 300 bucks.
B0067EW5LA|4|Was shipped well. Nothing damaged. Was easy to put on. Had a bad smell from the pipe for the first couple of times I ran the bike.
B0079QRS8K|4|Very spacious, comfortable, I get compliments that it looks cool. I've been asked twice, since I had it (about a week) what the name of the backpack was, so they could get one. I ride a Harley and I wear it on me whenever I need to bring my tablet, phone, portable chargers and gun with me. Has enough space in the back portion for a half-helmet to fit, a jacket, gloves, glasses, my cell phone, and even a laptop. The back portion is a hard material, likely plastic, and has a nice material covering it. I've gone on speeds up to 85mph with it on my back, on the freeway and it dose not lift away from your back; it is secure and snug. The aerodynamic design allows it to remain on your back with little to no drag. Overall a great product, would recommend to any rider looking for a solid backpack that stays on your back, without worry, while riding.
B000CQOIT6|4|This company is always make good high-quality receiver balls I find no fault are flaw with this item I recommend it highly
B003CJI4VI|5|It's real good and easy to fit up
B0083G3AXC|4|Works great! Easy on/off, and stable. Even fit a Dasani water bottle. My only wishes are that the tray area were a little bit bigger (though it is adequate) and that the square cut outs were a little bit wider, as my Galaxy S5 won't fit in there with a hard case on it. Overall, a handy device for camping chair.
B0096B9RFI|5|Fast delivery. This fit my car like a glove.<br />Installation went as expected. This radiator is identical to my original.<br />The amazon price blew the local part stores out of the water.
B00NPIUFMM|5|look amazing on the front of my gmc truck
B00HJEUUKU|4|Wanted to convert my rear signals to red leds to match the led tail/brake lights...this fit the bill. nice deep red...but could be a little brighter.
B012BRNSG2|5|This is perfect for my new honda hrv.  It came fast and fits like a glove.  I am very pleased.
B004J0NNXI|3|Small screen as expected. No scale or marks for better distance assessment.
B008RIEQXY|5|Put these on my 2011 gsxr 600 license plate mount. They are super bright and worked just fine. I recommend them.
B000NPUJQC|5|Nice set. Works great.. I'd get it again.
B001EAWNL4|3|Chimes work...but sound cheap compared to the factory chimes.  I've gotten used to it. Used a black piece of tape to cover the speaker hole as suggested on audio forums.  A little better...  otherwise...works good and the instructions were excellent.
B001GORX3Q|5|Bulb is great. They light up very well.
B00B9FEBSW|5|Great Item, fast shipping.
B00FEXCKTC|5|Looks good, fits properly, fairly durable.
B0036G7K44|5|These worked good. I was well pleased with this.
B003RWP2GA|3|Anyone  remember the instructions i foolishly threw mines out thanks
B00Z6ROOLS|2|Arrived on time, but could not get it to snap together around the chip. So could not use it.
B001KSCSQU|5|Fixed my service code on my 2004 Blazer! Just a pain to get to right above gas tank!
B005WEYQ5Y|5|The best, I wouldn’t trade it for anything better. Outstanding service and wonderful shipping prices and speed offer 2 to 3 days. Will trade again.
B004ETQ2LO|3|did not arrive with the second vent cap ( to the right) as depicted in the pics - in fact their is no opening at all on the body of the pack
B0010HNQ1M|5|Wow what a difference it made... my transmission woke up... old filter was clogged  up and sienna just has 100k... plz buy atf from toyota... mine uses type 4... it has power now
B00EPJDSAQ|3|It's ok i think but not work with my car...
B00523AMBC|5|We have only used this on one RV trip, but it worked out very nice and although I didn't taste the water before we installed it, the water after installation was very good tasting.  Very happy we bought it, much better than gallon jugs of water!
B00EDFVYG2|5|Everything I expected, and more!
B004JO7QYQ|5|My husband loves it... put on garage door and have a Karmann Ghia and VW bus parked in the driveway. Received it quickly and it was packaged nicely.
B004TRKBOK|5|Every car in the nation should own one of these--Velcro this item by your gas peddle leg and feel a sense of safety immediately.
B002ZNXX7C|2|Does not seem to work with my iPhone. It does charge but the audio does not work.
B001810SHA|5|This product was very easy to use and gave me great results. Prior to use my AC was not very cool. Now it is so cold I have to turn it down as it often gets TOO cool. Instructions were clear and easy to follow. I used 1 1./2 cans, so the 2 can package was perfect.
B0085KGOIE|5|great product
B00FQ0ROZS|5|All I have to say it that this lights are awesome. They are beyond my expectations.  Would strongly recommend.  I waited all day for night to come :)
B00LNIPAD0|5|We love him they fit great and a very comfortable
B00681BE2S|5|It works perfectly. Not a far range, but exactly what I needed.
B00192MU2Y|5|Would buy again...
B001CM74R2|5|This was exactly what I needed to control two lights in our RV.  The directions were easy to follow and the lights dim perfectly.  I did include an on/off switch before the dimmer so no current is drawn when not in use and this allows us to turn it on to the previous dimmer setting with one touch.  Well worth the money.
B002UC2WNO|5|Needed for an older RV windshield to hang new curtains. Just what I needed!!! Thank You.
B004OHJ33K|5|Love these, they work great and are easy to take out and clean. better then the leading brand
B00SS3VDES|3|Decal showed with no transfer paper on it (AKA a sticker) although its listed as a decal.  I proceeded to put the decal on anyways and while rubbing the bubbles out of the decal, the color started rubbing off. Basically this is white gerber with pink screen printing on top of it, which will never last in the sun or normal car washes.... I contacted the seller before posting this review and the ONLY reason I'm giving these a 3 vs. a 1 is because they sent me a second one free of charge.  So I guess once this one fails, I will at least have another to replace it with...
B00D8P2IBS|5|Should be on every gas meter
B0061FY004|5|This tool is great for making 90 degree holes.
B00ZJIYST2|4|Look great, fit good, my only concern is that the bulb socket feels looser fitting than my stock headlights.  Hopefully it will not let any moisture into the light over time.  As far as appearance they are very nice lights.
B000C15MUU|5|Absolutely the best lubricant for sewing machine owners and rebuilders.  It is a must have.
B00XM109AU|5|Great product
B00HVIGUGW|5|Perfect for finding the wifes keys.
B00FPXHJ9C|4|Worked great, only gave it 4 stars because I got XL because they didn't have L. Was glad, I'm no weight lifter and the XL fit good.
B00G8S07FQ|5|on the macbook and its awesome
B00OCHZBVA|5|Great product.<br /><br />Easy to install. I bought two sets. One for my motorcycle, in which I only wired up the red/black wire and the two yellow wires for Alarm feature. No need for Remote Start on a motorcycle if you ask me!<br /><br />On the second set, I wired it up on a Lawn Mower... why not.<br />Got the remote start working pretty easily.<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQTOjMGbkNU
B0075D0SAC|5|Dorman quality at over half the cost retail, I'm in, love it!
B001U2W6TU|4|Wonderful product with easy measurement attached. Been using product since I bought travel trailer and it was furnished by dealer,
B008G22REQ|5|Product installed easily and quickly on 2003 Dodge 2500. There was a very helpful U-Tube video on the installation process that took all of the &#34;mystery&#34; out of the process. The mirrors work well but if you flip them to the towing position you will have to use the up-down buttons to move it in and out and vis versa. Well worth the price, especially when your trailer is wider than your truck.
B00J55Y0M0|5|Great fits my 2015 RAM1500 no issues, works to protect key
B009HFINNA|5|They fit perfectly, but its a lot of money for a hunk of plastic.
B00J97X2YG|2|not cold
B00026Z3DQ|5|Great price. Mine are solid as can be. Good strong welds.
B00BAZBYTU|5|Awesome! Installed in seconds clean look, even better price. Little accents make your ride look great not big stickers!
B00UW2SRFG|5|Such a helpful tool to increase the functionality of my truck bed. The backseat of my crew cab is much less cluttered. I'm considering buying a second for my dad. Well worth the money!
B005UQQARG|5|Looks great in the back seat and pass anger. However, still trying to get the driver seat mat to work with the drivers right foot rest. I'm sure it'll fit Bette rid I just cut it but haven't yet because there's no line to follow to make it really fit. This is for my BMW 2004 X5
B0002MAANI|4|They do the job but I thought they were the ratcheting type
B000B8N3MS|5|Great. Works good.
B00BQL93IW|4|Worked fine. It would be nice if replacement directions were inc.
B0065WU1KG|5|I used this to pull the clutch off on my CBR954 when I was doing some transmission work.  While I certainly could have used another means to prevent the basket from moving, this was certainly the easiest method and least likely to damage my basket or surrounding aluminum surfaces.  I only wish the handle had a little more mass to it.  When you really have to put some force on it, it's not very comfortable to hold.  But not a characteristic I'd take stars off for.  Especially for a tool that I'll rarely have to use.
B000CITK8S|4|I purchased  the Battery Tender 021-0123 several years ago. I was disappointed when it eventually failed (it served me 4 years) so I decided to shop the market for competing brands. First was the Black & Decker BM3B. I was initially impressed by it's solid construction and cheaper price. It failed after 13 months. Next up was the Extreme Max 1229.4000 Battery Buddy. It is constructed much like the Battery Tender junior and, like the B&D, sells at a price less than the &#34;Junior&#34;. It just failed and I have only had it for 5 months. Operationally speaking - when they all worked, they appeared to work equally well.  The obvious solution is to pay the small difference in price and go with the unit that lasts 4 to 8 times longer. The old saying &#34;Buy quality and you only cry once&#34; may well apply here. Well okay - I guess for me I'll cry twice.
B00NWGVF7Q|2|Decently bright. Did not fit as advertised. OEM bulb housing would have to be bent for this to fit correctly. Did not want to do that on my brand new car. Returned.
B005I7JAX8|2|This is an old version that the company Auteltec.com no longer supports. It does have the codes for everything Audi make up to 2014 model years, but I am not sure they will help upgrade if you purchase a newer model Audi.... I could not contact the technical support from Auteltec since I was placed into a terminal hold and hung up after thirty minutes on the phone. The version that is current is the VAG505, This is a VAG405 model and has no way of being upgraded using the USB cable and a Windows 8.1 program. Disappointed, but for my 2009 Audi I was able to read codes.
B004LX3AS6|5|Small, easy to use, good price.
B005FG28K4|5|Mounts easy and works great!
B003ZWZ7VM|5|Works and fits great! Def worth it!
B00HLPRTLA|5|Wonderful product, well made, exact fit and great looking on the vehicle. Be careful with the hardware if you are ham fisted.
B000M8RYMC|5|Great product
B00559WHSE|5|Replaced this solenoid on my 2006 Chevy Colorado. Parts places wanted $120 to $150 for the one that my truck uses because it had the plastic hose. Didnt need it, reused the old one.  I replaced it for less then $17. Also got the new jumper. It was a piece of cake to replace. Thanks Amazon for having the parts I need.
B00449O9M8|5|fit perfect
B00CQD4CM6|5|Hated to pay this much for a dipstick but have found it is well worth the expense!  I can check the oil in my MINI and not have to try to decipher the level using the original , hard to read dipstick.  This dipstick is very easy to read and use.  Highly recommended!
B002692308|5|great replacement part !!
B0075HHNDS|5|Boyfriend loved it :)
B0006JLW84|5|Perfect fit...once I discovered which one I needed.
B000CIQMU2|1|Picture shows stock mirror and when i received it didnt fit the stock holes and i checked numbers everything said it was right product but still an aftermarket rectangular instead of rounded may want to change your picture to match product... forgot to mention i had to pay for return so i just didnt waste my time for 6$ back...
B00VYTDD3C|5|Great
B006Z98JFS|5|Genuine Honda part.
B000EDUTXG|4|Excellent product.  We have several in our RV.
B00AQ29FOY|5|Very quick delivery and easy to install
B0041E4KPC|1|It tore apart before I put it on
B0040QTXVW|5|Heavy duty cables in a hard case and long!  These cables are great, needed something longer in the winter and heavy gauge to jump start my Dodge 2500 snow plow truck
B004G4H6M6|4|Not much to say except worked as needed and as expected, which is perfectly.
B00U8NY2T4|5|just as they said
B001OMVCIC|5|They work really well and easy to install
B00K2AS94M|5|easy peel off / applique. stuck nicely to our textured walls. (this was a concern). Son loves them.  would recommend
B007MF0TV6|3|It fits the key fine. Probably not worth the cost but will serve it's purpose.
B004M6RTYI|5|Great product. Spot on shipping.
B003RQBKLC|5|This was a LIFESAVER on my recent road trip! The kids could play their electronic devices and I could keep the ipod (and my sanity) going and keep my phone charged all at the same time. Great product! Thank you :)
B0068ESRX4|3|We purchased this because we were riding in a dual sport rally that did sound testing. There was no way open DG O pipe would pass. I ordered the insert and received the product in two days! I had done some research earlier and read that he sleeve does not fit well with the spark arrestor.  Per instructions, I removed the Allen screws on the rear of the pipe and slipped the restrictor in place. When I tried to put the rear plate and Allen screws back in, they did not line up. I tried &#34;coaxing&#34; everything to snug up with no luck. I wound up grinding off part of the spark arrestor retainer ring to get it to fit. Not an ideal fix, cause the screen is &#34;spot welded&#34; to the retainer ring and has now been weakened. After grinding, everything went back together nicely.  In the video I had watched earlier, the guy simply chose to remove the spark arrester. IMHO not a smart option with fire danger in the west. Without the spark arrester, the insert wiggles and rattles around.  On the plus side, sound was dropped so it passed the AMA decibel text. It registered 91db.
B00KGO1TQE|3|They look nice and I'm glad I got them, but I had to take them to the dealer to have them mounted, since the OEM clips are too short to effectively mount them - they kept coming loose. An expensive process. Maybe the OEM part would not have had that problem.
B00BJ9ZRDG|5|Awesome wheel, gave my bike a nice solid look. Advice? Claims to be tubeless but make sure you put a tube in as it will loose air overnight. Change on that. The Morons who mounted my tire, didn't check to make sure that valve stem was tight. Once you dress that, you have a look that will make you smile every-time you look at your scooter. Great vendor, great price. Thanks
B000CI6ZF4|4|Good quality alternative to expensive factory part. Installed easy feels positive in engagement.
B00CNEQYF6|5|Perfect fit and only took a few minutes to install.
B007PBPI68|5|Highly Recommended!
B000TTEX8W|5|Come to find out my truck is not limited slip differential. You can either tell by a tag/sticker that wraps nearly around the entire axle, if you can read through the dirt near either tire. Or a tag that is sticking out on one of the differential bolts. These are typically the only two ways to tell without opening the differential. The dealer can't look it up by Vin to confirm if you have limited slip or not. I called and tried. It's cheap enough I bought in case. Once you take the differential cap off, if you see the majority of the gear teeth, then you Do Not have limited slip. If you have like a cap or cover on majority of the gear teeth and cannot see the gear teeth except maybe at bottom or top, then you Do have limited slip. The product does appear to be genuine Mopar additive as advertised.
B000CODE0M|3|It works but cheap quality
B00WGT2ZNI|5|Nice product and arrived as expected.
B009WKWSMC|1|Will not work for my Chevrolet Avalanche.
B005BWGOIY|5|Looks just like the original works perfectly
B008032QBA|1|If I could leave a 0 star review I would.. This pump failed 2 days after install, on a 110deg day in traffic with my 82yo grandma in the car with me. Not only was it expensive to have installed it was life threatening in its failure and doubly expensive to replace with a higher quality part. I would NOT buy this pump from this company again. Adding insult to injury it is beyond the 30day return policy so I cant even get my money back.
B00FTB3S90|4|Looks like a quality, well made product, but they do not fit the 2008 Honda Pilot.
B00PZ7TOD2|5|excelente
B003A3AVN0|2|Not a direct replacement for a 2006 FLHXi as stated.  Missing the bottom connector bracket that was shown in the photos but did not come mounted nor supplied. See my photos, you see they dont match the photos included in the description.  Fit between nuts and mounting legs is so close a craftsman deepwell socket would not fit between. Open end wrench is last option or grind socket thin.  Wiring is a direct fit.  The part did fix my problem and is installed because I needed to get the bike home.
B000FP8HUU|4|good buy
B001GH5PWY|3|Nice. But stays on nonstop. Took to a shop. Still stayed on. Don't want to run down battery.
B0016KH254|5|Perfect and easy
B00DOI9GFK|5|High quality
B007XE8C74|5|100% positive in time great product!!!
B003ZIXKMO|5|Fit perfectly on my 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan. Easy to install and looks great.
B00MBA5VNS|5|This is a great flasher for any emergency vehicle. The magnets on the base are plenty strong and stay on my roof rack at 70 mph. I would recommend this set to any firefighter.
B00SA25KWI|5|It looks amazing on my 2006 TOYOTA Corolla S. Everybody is asking how I got TURBO on my car. It's big and very good looking. Thanks
B0012GTVVA|5|Good solid bar and fit our camper door perfectly. Though I do have to admit I don't use it for what it is intended. My camper has a window on the door that you can see into. I don't like people seeing in my door but I do like the option of looking out the window. We installed this handle at the top of the door and hung a curtain from it. Works great!
B007IPKR76|5|Great battery!
B001R8ZS6A|5|Great but makeep sure you have instructions
B000CKFKZ8|5|good product
B003SG431U|1|Item does not fit my car I need to return it and I need you to send me a label to do so
B006GS3Q7E|5|Nice product
B00DN7WIQG|2|didn't fit. wrote to vendor for return
B007V2CDEG|1|sweet cover but too hot to touch to remove in this Phoenix sun!
B00AFJO91W|4|Stuff really works well.  Took very little scrubbing to remove the bugs
B00GBQ3KRW|3|probably not needed except for the rear arms
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Works great. No need to remove seat from motorcycle to check battery.
B0023VEX98|5|Perfect replacement. Fit like a charm. Would buy again
B001GJ3EJS|5|ok
B003C62LL0|5|No commuter inter-action yet, can't wait
B000HBNTX2|5|Works just as good as the name brand stuff.
B0041FXNNG|5|These things were so much fun to put on and the light accents that shine down on them at night look awesome as well. I have ABSOLUTELY ZERO BUYERS REMORSE for these.
B009TC9PG0|5|I have not used the refill bottles as the original charging is still cooling to 65 degrees .
B005J083OQ|4|looks great
B001KVW6EQ|1|Doesn't work on Jet Blue airplanes.
B00EKT9ERW|5|Went on super easy and looks awesome.
B000BRJTZE|5|fast shipping, packaged great, works good no problems, fit great
B00BLQEN9Q|2|Within three days the clutch cable and throttle return cable were broken.
B004C6I6LI|5|Very Very pleased.  Has beem handling the harse Louisiana summer weather well. Definitely a great buy
B000C9S78G|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B009PIIPHI|5|Purchased these after reading all the good reviews here on Amazon and couldn't be more pleased! They arrived very quickly and were packaged well. Quality is excellent. Install couldn't be any easier just remove two existing screws, put screws through holes in Husky liner and fasten to vehicle. Five minutes a side install time. They fit perfectly and look like they were installed from the factory. Since the fit, quality and price from Husky was so good I just purchased their Husky 99761 WeatherBeater Front and rear floor liners. It's nice to see there are still some companies out there that care about making quality products at a fair price!
B004I0JNYC|5|Great product nice and clearwith good reflector.
B00Y0AG2YE|5|Much needed! Thank you
B0001L0DFA|5|Works like a champ. Have very low water pressure.......results were like a low force power washer. Highly recommended.
B000VZMM28|5|So my 2004 Sabre's tired, old rear suspension left something to be desired... Particularly when my wife rode along (about 400lbs combined). The stock shocks were setup on the highest preload, but still would bottom out on most moderate bumps.  I ordered the Progressive 412 shocks on a Sunday (with the heavy duty springs). They arrived the following wednesday. It took about an hour to install with the help of a jack stand... I didn't even have to remove the stock exhaust.  We rode it 15 miles... So far I'm hooked. I set the preload at 3 and the two of us rode off. The suspension is firmer... Without being stiff. The shocks didn't bottom out at all. It was a much improved ride... I would recommend them to others looking to upgrade their stock suspension.
B00SY2ZAK6|5|Too bad this seems to have been discontinued.  I'd really like to get a couple more!
B0063ZBXZC|5|Awesome, works perfect!
B009FRFZ4K|5|Fits great and looks even better!
B001P2X4EQ|5|Very handy on my lawnmower for multiple applications.
B0050EH4EG|2|I ordered this ice maker to use in our RV and in our lanai when we have guests. It lives up to its promise to make ice quickly, but I've been disappointed in two things. First, the ice is very &#34;wet&#34; ice.  In fact it starts to melt as soon as it hits the storage container, so that when you scoop out the ice to use it, you get a lot of water with it. Secondly, the stainless steel outside of the ice maker has started to rust and we have only owned the ice maker a bit over a month. It actually started to rust almost immediately. My husband says that to be fair, I should mention that our lanai is outside and we live in Florida, so yes, it's hot outside. But I still think a portable ice maker should be able to handle warm outside temperatures. We used to have an ice maker on our boat and it was amazing in its ability to keep the ice freezing cold and hard in spite of temperatures exceeding 90 degrees in the cabin of the boat. This ice make doesn't do that. In all, I wouldn't buy this ice maker knowing what I know now.
B011MBEWX6|5|Awsome seat belt!!!! Recommend if you need it for your bucket seats!!
B00JA2JS2A|4|I got this product to support my tailgate while loading my ATV.  I did have to adjust the latches a bit to actually get them to some tension.<br /><br />Its important to know that these are there to help your cables, not replace them in any way.  I think the weak point on this would be the little latch clips.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars just because I don't think the latches can really hold that much weight if the cables were to go bad.
B00LG07MZE|5|Fits good in my 2011 F-150
B000C5SGAO|5|Installed to removed troublesome engine light..perfect!
B001AIZ5HY|5|Works with our 2004 Toyota RAV4
B00LHK6U2O|5|These look great and have good tension wires to adjust them to fit perfectly. They are very good hubcaps!
B0068EROF6|5|Nice rain suit
B00480841K|4|this mirror really made a difference in towing my camper/trailer
B00SSPS25E|3|It works
B00WMNQX1I|5|Fixed the jeep great item
B00BHYBPLG|5|Love it 100%
B008O1N1JE|5|Works great on my bike, 250cc dirt bike.
B00873J0YY|4|Very easily installed! Worked great for trip from upstate NYvto Ocean City, MD
B0041MGDLI|5|Bearings are running smooth.  No problems to report.
B011GL2YQY|1|Really good looking device, but the blue parts of chevron started falling out 2 days after applying it to car. I would by it again but apply my own appoxy to insure all parts stay in place.a
B003SS62PS|4|I'm one of those who loves sleeping with a fan on.  I've tested just about every portable fan that I can get my hands on and most of them sound absolutely terrible.  Same goes for this one as is, but if you remove the gears that make it oscillate its sound nice.  Either way it also blows plenty of air.
B000GTU7QW|5|My clutch was stuck so I installed these and now my clutch works again!
B005DUN00O|5|Stuff works good
B00YRHHDAW|1|cheap quality.
B000LNBLTK|2|I purchased this item because Amazon recommended ti to help install the window regulator. Non of these tools really helped at all. These tools should not have been recommended with my purchase of a window regulator.
B00OCAIDP8|5|Great color match, feels authentic.  Arrived quicker than expected
B000F5JMEA|4|I'm Really not sure why it is getting negative reviews. As long as you use it as it was intended to be used it works fine. The quality is excellent and it actually can be used on quit a lot of different vehicles.
B00HAQBEH0|5|Great flashlight, extremely bright flood light style light with good battery life
B00ROSXT0E|4|Good
B008KZQWTA|5|Great easy to replace not sure what all other people problem or if your little handy you could do it
B00AM1Z67O|5|Great Value
B00KCQSM84|5|Sorry,  cannot give a rating.  After package arrived, I realized it was not what I wanted.  Instead of returning, I gave the seat covers away.
B00301CF18|5|Worked perfect to replace a broken one I had
B00064331I|5|great
B00EKS5EN6|2|I bought this through dip your car, and it works as advertised, though it did take two rounds to get my rims completely clean. There are some rather large pitfalls though. 1. It's smell is indeed toxic...gag you and choke you up toxic if any of the mist blows back at you, which it will. They tried to cover it up with a nice citrus smell but it only makes it worse. 2. It turned the balancing weights on the inside of my rims a delightful green color. They now stand out very brightly on my dipped black rims when the sun hits them. It's wearing off with time albeit very slowly. 3. It did something funky to my brakes. Sure it made the calipers nice and clean, like new almost. Unfortunately under hard stopping my brakes now make a noise and feel that is similar to when you let off of them slightly at a stop light and they make that grip/slide farting noise. It's extremely disconcerting. I would say avoid letting the spray get through onto the brakes, but alas, that is very difficult. If it didn't do two and three I would recommend it with smell advisories, but seeing as it does, I'm slightly concerned at what its doing to my brakes and rims.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Excellent product. Once you get the hang of collapsing it for storage it's a breeze.
B0012PFL6U|3|i have a 99 tahoe 4x4 with torsion bars. not sure if thats why my ride is so rough even with new shocks. but, the price is great.
B002UKZSGO|5|Great decal that I needed
B00PV37ZEA|5|Its prefect . Very roomy .A lot better then a Wal-Mart trash bag.
B00PCE7R14|5|Just what I was looking for and very easy install too
B00JS9K12G|5|that obese Denise kicked and screamed at me before I could even strike the match!!! It's not as easy as it sounds.
B0000AXU02|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B00TBHXC4E|5|Yes, this is especially targeted for boat owners, but it also is great for cars.  Use of this does a lot to brighten the car's interior.  I certainly recommend it.
B0000AXDG4|3|not waterproof and very thin
B00K157LVA|5|Beyond Happy Absolutely Lovee It , Fits Perfectly In My Car & Came Before The Delivery Date
B00DI3DV6G|4|I needed something to put my car stuff in because previously everything slid to the floor every time I went around a corner. I put this on my front seat and it gets the job done. The separator is a nice addition. Would have been nice though if it had a strap to secure it to the back of my seat, as my seats are leather and the bottom is only designed to secure to carpet-like material.
B00Y1HQ45I|2|Not happy with these - remote start button doesn't work at all.
B00Q3CN6PA|1|There are no openings for seat belts. I ended up cutting holes in the cover for seat belt receiver so I doubt it will last very long. Pretty disappointed, wearing seatbelts is the law and the wise thing to do in a motor vehicle! Just seems ridiculous that the manufacturer didn't accommodate for this!
B00TPZP6HS|5|Looks great
B005GE3KZW|5|Fast shipping as described. 100$ less than local aluminum and hd what more could u want.
B00JMHIYY6|5|These are a good grease seal that is the OEM for my travel trailer buying  the bulk pack made them very inexpensive and now when I repack the bearings I have the seals that you are supposed to replace each time you repack which I do once a year.
B005MJYTYC|1|To completely honest the support it gave was nice, I can agree with the 5 star ratings. But after opening it, putting it on and walking around the house and sitting on the couch it started tearing and falling apart. The material is made of a cheap foam but the rubber ends on the straps are nice. I don't understand I picked the right size and everything. Dollar store quality on the material
B00B2HP1A4|5|Great end caps. I used clear silicone and the screws supplied to make a water tight end cap. I painted the pvc pipe with black 'truck bed liner paint' several coats, then assembled with end caps. I will use this to transport fishing rods on vacation so they are not in the vehicle and easily damaged on the ride.
B001G8AIMU|1|Chintzy.
B001AIZ5HY|3|by the time you're looking to restore your headlights chances are they are pretty far gone.  This pack gives you just enough sanding and polishing components to do one headlight (despite their claims).  You'll likely need to get two packs if you want to do a good job.  YMMV.
B0040CVR6U|5|Just what I needed!
B0007OWD2M|5|This is probably the best window cleaner we have ever used.  I have huge windows and they always streaked with any other cleaner I used.  This is a wonderful product and I won't be using any other glass cleaner, just Invisible Glass.
B000C2NWTM|5|I put the brake pads on myself and it was easy and the product quality was amazing. There was no break-in period so I hit the road runing. I installed these on a 2004 Audi A4 1.8T (four door).
B00KOU2UYU|5|DIY installation sucks! But I'm happy that I saved the $$$ and did it myself. Took most of my day but the results are great. Brought my 2008 crew cab Silverado up just where I wanted it. Doesn't have a &#34;lifted&#34; look just level.
B00AKOJ7NW|5|ok real good
B00WH1ZC80|5|Received timely and work just as expected.
B00WIUB6FS|5|Promotion reduced price....Awesome stuff. clean finish, can be hooked on to any vehicle
B0021YZER2|5|Works amazingly well. Cleared 95% of hard water and soap scum stains with just a little elbow grease. I used a 5&#34; polishing pad and a random orbital sander and it made quick work of disgusting stains (see photos). If you run your finger along the glass, though, it is apparent that there are still some remnants of hard water stains...and if you look closely you can verify this. So 95% clearance of stains is not bad. Worth the money.
B009PIKHYW|5|We have Husky liners and Mud guards on all our vehicles. GREAT products! Reasonably priced and the quality and fit are perfect!
B00BD4SMWK|5|look great great price
B00KPWBBLA|5|Love these!!!  Definitely sturdier than the plastic stock ones that came with the Jeep. Stock ones weigh about 10lbs each while these feel more like 45lbs each. Design is great and fit wasn't perfect but definitely workable.
B00G620ZVU|4|Good product..just as described
B00KZD8ME8|5|Look nice. No problems after 8 plus months of use.
B009RTQSCE|5|Fit perfect
B004Z75004|4|Cheaper than OEM and looks exactly the same. Same ride quality.
B008VJECBK|5|Received on time as agreed, well protected in suitable packaging. Tail light is a perfect match, bulbs included, simple plug in wiring. Compares well to OEM part removed.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Installed @ 2012 Acura TSX, perfect fit. Sunshade is more compact & more convenient than the accordion style that I was using before. Note that you will have to lower the car's sun visors to support sunshade. I especially like that the shade folds into a small pouch which is convenient for storage when not in use. My old sun shade was constantly in the way when my family was in the car with me.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product to help protect your car's interior.  It is quick and easy to install every time I get out of the car.
B00TKUYPQG|5|This fit perfectly on our 2006 Ram 3500
B00B3XUBES|1|Was disappointed.  Did not work to remove old stale smoke.
B00513G82U|4|Can't beat for the money.
B00062YACG|4|Works perfectly as an adapter from square bore carb/throttle body to spread bore intake. I used the adapter to install an FiTech Go EFI 4 throttle body to my factory Pontiac four barrel 1972 intake manifold. Everything lined up perfectly except for the included spread bore gasket. The primary holes were not drilled in the correct position and would have interfered with the air flow. I replaced it with a [[ASIN:B00068OO0S Mr. Gasket 56C Carburetor Base Gasket]].  You can see the results by googling &#34;mods and rods tv FiTech&#34;.  Update: This adapter served me well, but last fall I broke down and modified my factory intake so I could bolt my throttle body directly to the factory intake. I only did this so my shaker on my trans am is set at the correct height. This adapter would have stayed if I didn't have clearance issues.
B009ESL4HC|3|Great price and fast delivery! need to buy a red one now.
B00PGCD8WY|5|The iBoards fit well and look great on the truck.  The grip on the top of the boards seems to be much better than stock nerf bars, plus it runs all the way down the board.
B004EDF8HY|1|They did n ot work on my system, I ended up putting the incandescent bulbs back in.
B00TXAWAEC|5|Fit great in RZRs and give a large number of options for tying stuff down in the bed.
B002DZJQ0A|5|works great
B000COU7LG|5|Nothing better then Mothers
B009M0S4Z2|5|Good fit
B001BNHY1S|3|To small for car.
B001TK7CYM|5|These are a great buy, perfect for on the bike, and just an FYI, I wore these to the local dirt track races and they were a lifesaver!<br />Definitely a bargain for two pair.
B006ZDXPXA|4|Easy to install looks great perfect cover up
B0093A9ST2|4|Ok
B00S05TU3K|5|The fit is exact, however the back opening is small so you can't get the connectors through. Also the retention clip which holds the bulb in place isn't there to sit bulb on.
B00DHGPVKI|5|Charged up two Optima batteries and another marine battery.  Small size stores well.
B007TWXVJY|5|love it!! fits like a glove and supports my fav team. go bucs!
B0012WHBSO|5|Light, quiet, QUIET, effective. Best &#34;small&#34; compressor I have ever owned.
B004A5UPZQ|5|Perfect replacement for original parts (Toyota Venza, rear); recommended!
B002MQCYO0|5|Great stuff, you need this if you have a windscreen on your bike.
B0002MG9TC|4|Really like it.  Holds tight and folds up flush with sidewall.
B00BJCHX8K|5|Very happy with product would recommend
B000C7JHEG|5|Worked perfectly in my 1989 Sea Ray 180 with Chevy 4.3.
B0081S9C16|5|Service was excellent and alternator a great value, will soon buy another!
B009NRO6G0|5|Can't believe it took me so long to buy on of these wrench!
B001GMN6FM|3|Broke after having it less than a year.
B000IZ2YTW|5|Works perfect.  Just as good if not better than oem. Adding relays will make these come alive.
B000NK7992|5|had these in my cars and trucks for years, love them and will never use anything else
B003IDJNJU|5|Husband loved it
B0024EC170|3|Fit my spare tire great, material seems a bit cheap.  I'll see how long it last.
B0046QSKCO|5|I had this lock for over a year, I really liked it because as a college student I didn't want anyone to just roll it away from where I parked or play a prank on me. But depressingly my Honda Ruckus was stolen last week with this lock on the handle bar IN MY GARAGE, so yeah I've pretty much lost all faith in humanity. Moral of the story-- don't be stingy and get insurance for your scooters, biggest regret for me.
B008S9LGAS|5|good
B009I6ABR4|4|Fit perfect on my 1993 Mazda B series truck.  I just wish the bolts to attach the bumper was included.
B0049EH3C6|1|Needed rings for all 6 clyinders not one.
B00UZE80N0|5|Made my sons Mustang convertible top look great, highly recommend. Thanks
B0033WNJBO|5|Great hitch.  Easy install
B009XIWRLA|5|GREAT ITEM
B00027GUVE|5|Bolts right up, comes with gaskets, works perfectly.
B000F15H4I|5|Got my first DashMat in the late 70's.  This is like all the others that I've purchased.
B004I0TH0W|5|Fit perfect, easy to install
B00WH3V926|5|Works great and at a great cost.
B004J10QQ4|5|Was a perfect fit!!! Very fast shipping!!
B00ODQ74TM|5|Extremely bright and customer service and support is excellent!
B001F4MQYI|2|the telescoping rod broke after only three uses
B000LY9IIA|5|Piece of cake to install by myself.  Item packaged well!<br />The weight of the item and the weight of the packaging don't seem to add up and it appears to me that somebody got ripped off for the shipping weight.  I was concerned how I would move this heavy item by myself.<br />It's not that heavy!!
B008DL2D1W|5|Used these in a friends car, and they look cool and work as specified.
B0044XHW6O|5|Sturdy clear would recommend
B00J2CI5PE|5|These will look good when used, but the wife didn't like the look in her Buick.
B000C0WOXY|5|Replaced my idler pulley on my 2004 GTO. It has worked great so far, no issues.
B00HY3COJG|5|Good product
B00861FZUU|5|This part fit perfectly on my Chrysler Town and Country. The engine felt stronger than ever after replacing the stock catalytic converter with this part from Magnaflow. Highly recommended.
B001EOYIRW|5|Great easy to install and durable
B007G67JCS|5|Highly Recommended!
B007TY4STY|5|Easy to replace.  Works excellent.
B0041Q2BM4|5|Great item rode from BC Canada to Sturgis and back no problems lots of kms/miles on it
B00EM7S414|1|Installed in late Dec 2014. Installed well and the part fit just like the OEM part that it replaced.  About three months later it was not operating as smoothly as when it was first installed.  On Aug 26, 2015 the metal bearing roller fell apart.  The roller sleeve separated from the bearing.  I will buy OEM to replace this.  The price savings is not worth having to redo the work a second time 8 months later.
B00KBTSMW8|5|Excellent oil reduced the top end noise in my twin cam
B002P8QSAG|5|Needed to replace this mirror as I backed up into my metal gate and broke it off my Civic.  Easy to install.  You will need to take apart a small part of the inside of the door to access the bolts/screws.
B009WPZK4K|5|ROLL TIDE
B0009JKGJW|5|Great product. good price
B0041CC8AI|2|Only giving 2 stars cause my wife can use them. Having bought these for a 4 wheeler i thought the price was great. However after receiving these the plastic lens is soo thin that i can push it in, it reminds me of a phones screen protector... Also based on other reviews/questions i saw that these might work OTG but the dont. The space between the top and the top of the nose is too small, and i wear smaller classes.
B00EECMBUM|5|I LOVE THESE LIGHTS !! THEY ARE REALLY BRIGHT , REALLY WHITE AND LOOK GREAT !! FIT PERFECTLY WITH MY 2003 BMW 325I .. JUST SWAPPED THEM OUT WITH MY STOCK ONES !!
B00ACNBK5O|4|Great product, but really not sure why the outside two screws on each side are plastic.  I used two screws from the old screen to lock it down better, just didn't trust the plastic.
B007JCSQ6W|5|Fits perfectly!
B003QVIXKY|5|direct fit and function for ford contour 1999.
B00L1LQME0|4|Beware quantity 1 means a bag of 4
B00P1LVCQE|2|Don't like the fact that the message can peel off.
B004X1TO3G|5|I love everything about these. I have used this brand for years, I have all different colors of glasses for different reasons and uses. The padding around the glasses really does help them stay on and keep sand and dirt out of your eyes.
B00BK860D2|1|What I got, unlike what promised to be what I wanted, didn't fit.  Plus, I had to pay to send it back.  GRRR.
B0115Q14Q6|5|Seller is sending a second set of screws. Looks great.
B00684TIVE|3|Programming was a breeze.  The only problem seems to be a very limited range.  Most of the time I might as well use the actual key.  For less than ten bucks, I can't really complain.
B000CMHVBC|5|This really works...this shield saves me 25 minutes during the winter and during the frost temp months.
B001UCILGW|5|They stop car. Shipped quickly.
B000NVW1LM|3|a
B00D2IITOQ|5|muy bueno
B00E1ETJNU|5|Very good
B003S9I8OU|5|Works great!
B00T8HPEVG|5|I've been using the Kensun® New Technology All-in-One LED Headlight Conversion Kit (from HID or Halogen) - H7 - 30W 3000LM for two weeks and I'm very satisfied. I spend a lot of time behind the wheel, I have a BMW x3 with 245k miles on it.I love the x3 but my biggest issue had been burning through halogen headlights every 6 months. It didn't matter what brand or color temp I selected the headlights were toast after 6 months. Living in New England that translates into a very uncomfortable job when they fail in February.<br /><br />The Kensun conversion kit is fully plug and play. I took the old halogen bulbs out, replaced them with the Kensun H7's and I was done! The kit includes two additional pairs of light filters; amber and blue. I went with the blue, really happy with that call. Great projection and much better visibility compared to the halogen bulbs. This was money well spent, I would recommend these to a friend.
B0038AAW16|5|Perfect replacement, just a few minutes and fan like new again :)
B005WXNFDY|1|Mine fell apart within 18 months, the Colorado sun (UV) rotted the fabric to the consistory of tissue paper. Will not buy again and would not recommend to anyone.
B00Q0DVT4M|1|I bought a set of these to replace my 2003 Trailblazers scratched up, faded pair of tail lights. Delivery was a bit of a carbuncle; even though left and right assemblies were ordered at the same time, from the same supplier, they shipped on different days. Initially, I was satisfied. TYC made a perfect fit to the OEM tail lights. Installation was no problem, however, function is. From the beginning, my left hand signal didn't work. Just to be thorough, I checked fuses, bulbs, and pulled out my voltmeter to verify power. Everything with my SUV was working as it should, so I pulled apart the plastic bulb carrier to find the problem. The terminal that supplies voltage to the left hand turn signal had been crushed (PICTURED BELOW). To fix the problem, I transfered the bulb carrier from my old lenses to TYC's new lenses.<br /><br />Do the lenses look great? Yes. Do the electrical components work? No. If there was an option to rate these at zero stars I would.
B007LICL56|3|Looks nice ..!! Love it fit it the rear part of car just didn't fit in the front need longer one for a mitsubishi lancer 09 :\ sad
B000W0RQ8C|5|Works better than a bolt, and can't be easily removed.
B00948PIPQ|4|Works really nice.
B004URMD9A|5|This stuff is really amazing.  You have no idea how dirty your windows are until you get them clean with this.
B008621DA0|5|Product arrived on time - was as advertised - Installed appropriately and easily.
B00LNG6C3Y|5|Mats arrived on time and seemed to be pretty good for the price. Though for my 1998 corolla all four mats are kinda small. Only reason i give four stars is because they do stay in place quite well and quality is pretty good for what I paid.
B00QW3VN46|5|Great customer service wonderful product just what I wanted
B00JSJMV38|5|I have a 2006 honda accord cope and I bought the medium size which fits great. I see some complaining about a &#34;smell&#34;, it goes away in several days and isn't that bad. The cover looks and is made very well. Great for the price.
B000CPC43E|5|Had no problems going on looks
B000EQDU3E|5|This loaded caliper came attached to the wrong mounting bracket, the passenger side was right. Had to reuse my old caliper bracket. These calipers are a great deal, but getting the wrong stuff is never good.  UPDATE: These have been on my truck 3 months and perform wonderfully so I am moving my ranking up to 5 stars.
B000A0O27C|5|Protects my spare and looks a lot better than advertising. Quality should last 5 or more years.
B00EBB27FU|4|great quality item!
B00PWMUGL4|5|Great Quality
B00NOMYUES|5|Good
B000C9RS4U|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B00VU970D0|5|good product
B00KQSLUAU|5|Just like original
B002WQHO7M|5|it fit great
B0087NB53S|5|Works great for hearing the audio on my Goldwing.  Battery charge lasts several days of riding.
B001P3035I|3|Not bad for the price but I needed something that would keep me cooler longer
B0002JMV06|5|As described, works well
B007HRN72M|4|works well.
B00XJG63N0|2|Could be clearer and louder
B0050EFHWW|5|It is sturdy, easy to clean.  The flush works well.
B00379ABX2|5|Withstands rough weather.
B003V57NUQ|5|Ok let me start by saying I have looked at so many kayak roof carriers but kept coming back to this one. Well I have read so many reviews saying it's hard to assemble. Are you serious. I mean it's about as easy as anything I've ever put together. Granted mine came with no instructions but in about 15 seconds it was clear how to assemble. How anyone would spend hours assembling is a mystery to me. There are 6 bolts per unit. 4 short and 2 long. In about 5 minutes it was done. I mounted on my Toyota Sequoia roof rack in another 5 and was ready to go. I read in one review that the length of mounting hardware too long and gouged roof. Well duh you can easily shorten with a hacksaw or a Dremel if you need to. I carried a 14.6 foot riot edge kayak very easily. Hit over 75 and it didn't budge. What a bargain to carry your kayak. As to the straps well they were ok for my use so far. Overall I would highly rate this product. With the money I saved I got a nicer paddle. Ignore the negative reviews. If you have some basic common sense this will work. Great product
B00ABRFG1U|5|Perfect fit. Makes looking for something in the glove box a pleasurable experience! : )
B00DOZY586|5|Very good.
B00QSA77NE|5|OK, I typically don't leave reviews - but I love this stuff! I collect toys and on the day I received this order I also received three toy cars with broken parts and decided to give the glue a try and it was AWESOME. Very easy to use, very strong and and truly a pleasure. I choose this combination because the UV flashlight used an easily obtained AA battery.<br /><br />Update 1/28/2016 - back to a 5 star rating! I have ordered three of these units, had a problem with one flashlight and the manufacturer immediately replaced it without waiting for my returned item to get back to them. Great service and a willing to work with a person means a lot.
B006YU7G8E|5|Very difficult to find this at my local auto stores. But fixes my CR-V problems by just filling the fluid every 20k miles or so. Not sure why the CR-V gets a weird creak in the steering, but sounds like it happens to many CR-V's. Fortunately, it's not too expensive to buy a bottle and top it off.
B000R308RA|5|It's been on the truck for about 8 months now with no issues. I put silicone around where the wires connect to the bar and it has been fine.
B008QF2EF0|5|Yea the fit was great and a great replacement
B00G9C5Y2C|1|Disappointed looks like a refrigerator magnet
B00ESLBRU4|5|Perfect cables for a HID H11 kit that had a harness with just the metal clip wire ends they wanted me to insert into the factory harness and secure with electrical tape. LOL! I said screw that and ordered this so I could properly connect the ballasts with a connector. The amazing thing is that the HID kit was a higher quality kit than the usual cheapo versions. I guess they saved .0003 cents per package by not including the H11 harness connectors. iJDMTOY to the rescue!
B000S2IZ6Q|5|decided to install these when i replaced my ball joints / good quality.
B00068XCQU|5|Fantastic battery charger.
B0022ZWO0K|5|Don't know why Harley just couldn't make the tappet oil screen screw allen or torx. But this tool did the trick. Bit difficult to use as it likes to slip out when torqing it, but I think that's more a problem caused by the poorly designed screw and not  the tool.
B000QIWAJ0|1|Wrong part arrived damaged  the description says it fits 2005 Avalanche  it doesn't.
B00D39407O|5|Nice looking fabric....looks yo be well made byt im not a seemstress. Mine had a few loose threds here and there but nothing major. Had it up in the AZ heat for 3 months now and still looks great.
B0046QZXLU|5|Great company to deal with.  Product was what was advertized
B00OPMIR2M|3|This product is fair. I think it does work, but it is bulky and can't always fit where I want it to use it.  I also changes the base measurement from psi to other standards.  Since it came with no instructions, I'm not sure how to fix this problem.
B002SJBXLQ|5|no complaints whatsoever
B000EQS0SY|5|It worked well for my car, my factory installed button was so faulty I finally broke the thing from pressing it so hard. Now I can look at all the s*** in my trunk and not be angry! Well until I realised how much of a mess it is
B00407RTBW|5|Works great
B00LLOEDX4|5|A+
B00JKSP28S|5|This starter worked fine on my John Deere L100. It has been on about a month and works fine. The starter arrived very quickly.
B00KGGTGO4|1|The shade does not fit our RV window, disappointed!
B00WX0VSRO|4|Good lighting, but didnt go out to far, wider than it was far. Still very usable
B007VR6680|1|Cheaper on jegs and only fits on a camaro
B00266ILZW|5|Works just as advertised..!
B000JFJLP6|5|Product as expected.
B0021ELXOU|3|I understand that not one shape can fit all faces, but there's still space between my nose and the nose bridge of the shades. 'Doesn't block airflow 100% around my eyes because of that. I've had these for at least two months now, and the rubber grip things on the ends of the glasses have been pulled off from the friction between my head and my fitting helmet..
B000LNBLTK|5|Exactly what I needed when working on interior panels where I don't want to hurt the surface.
B0009TU6VA|2|I did not contact the seller, but the item was made for a fuel line not the actual fuel filter. It is only about 1/2 inch tall. Not what it was projected to be.
B00GKMTWH4|5|Works Great
B002PX9Z6A|5|Received in a timely manner, good product. AAA+++
B0058WXNOK|5|Ok
B0017UBHQS|5|Product exactly as described.   it's a plastic rivet.  Make sure it's the size you want.
B003UT3S6Q|3|Doesn't go very far..but is an okay product.  Maybe I put it on a little generously.  But seems to work.  Elbow grease would probably be okay too.
B005MZYKWW|5|Wife loves it
B00SHLORR6|5|Good product
B00D2I0IDG|5|So far this unit worked great for me
B007ED84XG|5|my sister loved it!
B007EXP006|5|Great product and easy to install. The old seal was only 3 years old but totally rotted. Hopefully this will last longer.
B00KNNOLYK|5|Great.
B004VRLGU6|5|These Wonder Wafers are great.  Have them for my Denali and keeps it smelling great.  Definitely going to keep buying once I get low.
B00JZR3IEO|4|received quick and is what is advertized
B00EI6CKVE|5|gotten many compliments on this. very cute I love it
B00QHAASF4|5|Easily installed in less than 5 mins. Provides a nice amount of storage.
B000S2U49W|5|Worked as it should
B00QPV8B22|5|These brushes are made of a great material. It is strong and sturdy, but not too heavy. There's a padded grip for comfort. The fact that it comes two to a pack is even better so I can put one in my husband's car as well. We're currently in Texas summer right now, but the times we do get hit by a freeze in the winter (which has been happening more often), it hits us hard. Texas shuts down in ice and snow. Considering we live in apartments and don't rent garages, these brushes will come in handy to help us get the frost and snow off our windshields and windows. Much better than the credit cards I use when I am unprepared.<br /><br />I will be updating my review after the first freeze, but at least I'm ready for it now!
B001P2HTK6|5|Simple install. They install onto body, not onto frame. They support my 215lb weight easily.
B0042VTYV4|5|I haven't been in a situation to break any windows or cut seatbelts but I'm confident with this tool I'll be ready
B000GZX2HW|1|Very basic lots of gaps in manual spend the money for a better one
B006H5A610|5|Very good..
B000IYUACQ|4|Stops well lots brake dust though
B005DUN42I|3|Nice I just fee that I can't get them tight enough so they won't come off... May go back to regular grips with glue eventually
B004CJ4IQC|5|Works Great!  Way less bugs on my truck and 5th wheel.
B003MR96M6|5|Excelente
B00029WSX6|5|installed this mirror on my conversion van many months ago.... Takes a relay to make my Ford Van lights come on with door switch but works great!!! Love it.<br />Thanks.
B0035JHO70|5|Sounds great easy installation and came early
B008CLPN2Y|3|Better torque,no improvement to gas mileage
B0018CWF3Y|4|Customer was happy
B00ECGWRHC|1|I purchased this product in August of 2014, it is now August 2015 and the product has started to completely corrode and fall apart.  It is a clock for a motorcycle so it should be able to withstand weather and direct sunlight.  I loved the look and ease of installation of this product, but unfortunately it is made with shotty materials and is not very durable.
B0022ZRTEQ|5|It was just what I expected
B008CE06ZA|5|Best one I found to date.  Most flexible for matching tow to weight ratio requiring very little work to adjust.  I'm using it on Polaris Ranger to haul a variety of rigs for upkeep on my property.  It rattles a little if your driving surface is irregular, but not enough to bother me.  If it did I would just shove a piece of cardboard between those metal surfaces.  I'm pleased with the products performance.
B004SBVITO|5|So far it is working great.  Very good price and fast delivery!!
B001AWLTX4|3|Okay.
B005XRPZVO|5|easy fit and they look sick
B00HJEGQQ2|3|These installed PERFECTLY and easily into an older 1980's Toyota truck stop light bulb socket and work flawlessly.<br /><br />However, there is not much brightness difference between 'running' red and 'stop' red...which is disappointing. 'Running' red is pretty bright. It's not that big of a deal to me because I added a large, bright third brake light bar to the tailgate...but I believe there should be an obvious brightness difference between stop and just running when driving at night. Obviously this is only a factor at night.
B004IVGA0G|5|works perfect with telescoping flagpole.A little pricey but worth it.
B0023VGHV0|5|THEY LOOK GREAT ON MY 2003 BMW 325I . I GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME... SUPER EASY TO INSTALL !
B0083UBYO0|4|It's okay but not brilliant shine.  Very protective.  I can wash and wash and it's still there.  Just not as high gloss as some.  But okay and seems to go a long way.
B00192KY04|5|Fit was good
B0134PT1HA|5|Perfect
B00PBCT2D8|3|Ford should include these when you purchase your vehicle for as much as you spend. Online research suggests wheel locks are merely a deterrent to real thieves but something is better than nothing. I say if they want it, make them work for it. Considering what tires and wheels cost, it's definitely worth the investment.
B00MQ9ZHN8|2|Color does not match, it's putty not tan. Will be returning.
B005KLVYBI|5|Great seller. Would repeat buy again.
B00OPVQ7GQ|5|I have heard horror stories about fitting plastics from China on bikes, but these look and fit perfect.  I would, and most likely will buy from them again.
B000C5WD08|5|Good product @ a good price
B00IA265DG|5|Fits our 420 exactly!
B00239WHLG|5|makes the job easier
B000GVQZ8Y|4|Seriously, my car smells like a supreme pizza when it is hot, I've asked multiple people after getting out and they all agree.<br /><br />Does seem to work, gas tank is cooler on my miata with less pressure build up. Car is supercharged and some timing is being pulled so the exhaust gets very hot.
B00AO4Y0L2|5|Highly Recommended!
B004SEVNC8|5|High quality part. Perfect fit.
B001FC79EW|5|handy and works well
B00HNKYD0I|3|It seemed to work for a couple of weeks and then they were back.
B000K9EBQK|5|i recommend this product. Make sure you have the correct vehicle chosen and you should be good to go.
B00B505GSU|4|Probably could have gotten this cheaper at some kind of generic store because it's just vinyl and cardboard but it does the job and keeps my scooter docs organized!
B001RLOE4O|5|great plugs for my gsxr-750 2008
B00OHREG34|5|great part, fast delivery.
B00L3KDUD0|5|I've tried so many different types of brushes over the years.  I was at the point where I would just use a microfiber cloth and a small wooden stick as I had given up on finding the perfect wheel brush.  Now the search is over.  This set has been the answer I've been looking for.  They are on the expensive side, but they are well worth it.  I use all three sizes and they work great on all four of my cars.  Can't beat them.
B002HGFRNU|2|Used for golf cart left in Florida for 8 months of summer. Boiled lots of water from the batteries, did not rejuvenate as stated. Batteries were useless the following year, even though friend kept check on the water level.
B00OV7HKA6|5|You will not ever be stranded ANYWHERE anymore with this device Great product!
B00HYJFTLA|4|Didn't bolt onto my 2006 Jetta tdi, It may be intended for a automatic because mine is a 5-speed. The fans bolted right on to my original assembly and the motors work great!
B0002KKTFO|5|Yep, so far only small leaks from the oil separating out of the grease. To be expected from basically every type of these. Injection nozel is smooth and great
B000HM579K|5|As I expected
B00ZGIY368|5|I really like this little jack. It's the perfect tool for those who don't want to sweat it.
B000C5M0OW|5|Product came quickly, and worked just as expected
B002T3FU2E|5|great product
B000P17NXQ|3|Came with instructions without any specific application for my vehicle (for example, wire colors were different on the vehicle).  I found a video on line for my vehicle and generic &#34;brake control install&#34;.  That went well.  Seems to work fine, but my wife finds it very confusing to adjust, and on occasion it gives us warnings that we don't have brake control.  No shorts or anything detected, but feedback on the display doesn't help.
B0097MX2V6|3|they are ok
B003VASDEG|4|received quick and is what is advertized.  Used  a pair for many of miles, they are sturdy.
B000QGSHDU|4|Product arrived quickly and undamaged.  It also fit properly as expected. (Note: 5-star means &#34;you love it&#34;...really?  Its a car part.) So I also submit to you that I was satisfied with experience as that is more accurate.
B000C9SH2C|5|Fit as described no modifications
B00877SL2M|5|GREAT
B000IZ2CIK|5|Works as describes no leaks
B006571VG4|4|great part for the price
B0002MBKA0|5|Love it
B00V89ZV1A|5|Good working bulbs with the right color
B007T8C66W|1|These were a piece of s*** from the begining. They were about two inches to short, they aren't even close to being shaped like the original. Just junk ended up using them for patches instead. Don't waist your money
B00BG7K6NW|5|Awesome product
B00ILXLLLU|1|Poor quality. Basically a laminated picture. It lasted thru 15-20 washes maybe 2500 miles on front of truck and was just thrown away.
B007SKAKPU|5|dreaded p0446 code works great for clearing code
B00BTLEHSK|2|Front seats not so bad to install.  Head rest did not fit so they would look good.  Back seat impossible to install.  Straps broke while trying to install. Back of the seat fabric snags easy.  I kept them for the front seat covers but would not recommend.
B000VASMV8|5|Works good
B000BQUEWC|5|Liked it
B00CMUD8E6|5|perfect fit a good price and a genuine part.
B0030GF2LI|4|It's good and meets expectations. Sticks like a magnet on the car and you can take it out when you like. Need to be careful how you keep it after you take it off otherwise it can bend around the corners but if you press those then it's fine.
B00G7PYMN8|3|Ok
B00Q3F91YC|1|Too small
B00062YVUC|5|Very good gauge set. Easy to hook up and has red or green covers for lights
B004BORLDA|4|This is top quality oil but only 4 stars due to the price.
B000BNA8GM|4|Great product when using these covers on my other vehicles and have been very happy with them we shipped on time with no problems just wish it was a little bit cheaper but honestly you get what you pay for.
B000CGR49C|5|FANTASTIC PRICE FOR THIS HIGH END BREAK. TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL MECHANIC AND HE INSTALLED WITH NO PROBLEMS. I ACTUALLY LOVE THE SOFT BRAKE COMPARED TO THE HARDER STOCK BRAKES.  WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN, YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS BRAKE PAD
B00O0SRA74|5|Very nice Lights thank you again thank for all your Help
B003ZMH6F2|5|Awesome!
B0014GEOHY|5|had a good old school look to them on the bike
B004ZJYYWW|5|good product!
B007PBPI68|5|Crazy bright. Used them for back up lamps in a fabricated bumper for my old Benz. They're more like fog lights haha.
B004GFS2C8|5|EASY INSTRUCTIONS.... MAKE SURE YOU DO EVERYTHING BY THE BOOK AND IT WILL WORK PERFECTLY ... STOP MY CRACK FROM SPREADING AND IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THE CORRECTION .!!
B008MQ5CT8|5|Looks good
B00BJ4EIH2|5|Worked as advertised
B004XH67B2|5|Fit my D4800 XS Power battery with no issues.
B00KBINF7G|5|Works great. I have had it for several months and have used it to charge my phone,  Garmin  , computer and have used it to jump start my tractor, (a Ford 3000 diesel and) and have also used it to jump start my Suburban . It is amazing. and it holds charge for about 4 months. It is so handy I would not hesitate to recommend this to everyone. I comes in a nice case you can just store in your glove compartment . 5+ from me.
B000BH5MAA|5|What a life saver! This leveler works like a charm. The box says it comes with a wrench, but mine didn't. Luckily my husband travels with a small tool box in the truck and had the right socket and wrench. The tent trailer (12&#34; wheels) is so much more stable now. Just remember to lower the leveler and remove it before lowering the tongue when you are packing up your site. There's definitely an order to things to make it all work!
B00318NUCI|5|vw golf and jetta bulb for the console, i used electric tape and a food thermometer to change it with out removing the whole console
B0059RC65G|5|Great product and very easy to clean!
B00BH0K67E|5|Look great kids wont get them off
B005271AZA|5|Easy to install and looks great.  Put on my 2013 JK
B00379ABX2|4|OK
B00NPY02EW|5|I brought the PP3 master kit from a Matco truck a couple of years ago. My auto electrical work ranged from a bulb out to no schematics, aftermarket bus a/c work. This has drastically cut my time down.<br /><br /> I read the PP4 reviews this was a no brainer for me. The PP4 has more features packed in a slightly bigger case with double the plug connecter size. It only comes with 20 ft of cord though :, (. Power Probe has 20ft extentions for $105.00 or so but I am using my PP3 extention with banana clips for RV work. The injector tester & PCM driver tester are worth it alone!
B00SR5FM6W|5|Awesome part. came fast and professionally packed. i threw it in my buggy and it started right up. the price is a little steep but definitely worth it. would recommend it to anyone buying a carb
B00MIFKN98|5|Easiest and least expensive DIY fix for my 07 Altima
B00QQ5R754|3|A little disappointed, I ordered this same switch and it was supposed to have &#34;Bilge&#34; printed on it.<br />It came blank.<br />But the quality of the switch is great.
B00PWDHT4A|3|Great light! But the brackets don't work for my 06 Dodge Durango..
B00QMWQJRS|5|Good quality! Fast Shipment!
B000IYJJLO|5|Worked perfectly on my 2007 HHR
B00WILYDVG|5|Awesome product I love my new towel, I swim 3 days per week and I use it every time to get dry, it absorbs everything and the quality is very good.. I'm very happy with this product, I would buy of again if needed
B0000AY4YJ|3|greasy
B007Y85XLC|5|Exact fit for my Pontiac Grand AM 2004 V4 2.2L. Easy to install.
B00GKH6TCK|4|It's a clutch boot.. not much to say. Factory part, fit well and easy to install.
B00KC399SY|4|This battery I couldn't kind anywhere in my home town .
B002XM5G70|5|not as quiet as I hoped for but does push the water good

B000CNLBL2|5|Outstanding!!! It sounds perfect!
B0096DP8B8|5|Perfect
B000CMIGB6|5|Came when expected, easy to install. Looks no different than original which had 125,000 miles on it.  Noticed original had several cracks from wear.  Was time to,replace.
B0090149R0|5|Just fantastic
B000E4JLM0|5|Great Item, fast shipping.
B0041E1YEM|5|Bolted right on works great and shipped fast
B00AWQ0LJ2|1|Bulbs aren't bright at all stock bulbs are brighter very disappointed
B0013FVY3I|5|exact fit and less $$$ for 99 intrigue.
B00A9HM3MM|4|I have a kayak trailer I tow with two vehicles. Prep is easier with hitch locks keyed the same. I gave this set 4 stars because (1) the lock housing isn't as heavy duty as I expected and (2) the key side hangs down. Yes there is a rubber cap to protect the end but I can see water/rain getting right under the cap and causing corrosion right away. Having said all that, the pins and locks are sturdy and I'm satisfied!
B00G0OUGSG|5|Worked great and a great price.
B000EM019O|5|I use this on my faded 2001 jeep wrangler bumper and flares....wow..I used 4 coats and my jeep looks brand new!
B00LACAP02|5|It was a little smaller than i though, but that's on me (size is in the description lol) Very easy to put on clean, fantastic product.
B0022Y2GZE|1|Never worked!
B00ATTRK7S|5|Everything I needed was in the packet.
B0009IK5NU|5|This is an awesome wiper for my QX4. It works better then the one Infiniti sells for the SUV!
B00XQD4QU8|5|Color is alot darker, more brown than beige as described... but fits great and looks good too.
B003TY6WJC|2|A waste of money.
B003YJJHI0|5|Bought this to control some of the RV parks water pressure we went to.  Seemed to work well but most import LEAD FREE
B003TPB3ZY|5|Best oil money can buy
B00ACMF53S|2|The part was not correct for the year vehicle it was ordered for. The part had to be modified in order to make it work.
B00UG52P7U|3|We really wanted to love these but they fell short in a couple ways. The main reason is they hang too loose on the headrest. Yes, I tightened the strap at top but they didn't hang nicely on our seats. It may be because they are slightly curved on the back and not perfectly flat like the ones shown in the picture.
B0114H72IK|5|[[VIDEOID:6a9f8c37977eb27f883f63aff7e5fcbe]]This item is great for me because my work vehicle get very hot with little air movement with this fan I can face it towards me and it helps cool me down and give air movement.  This fan you hook into you light outlet to give it power.  This would also be nice for camping. It may or may not sit on your car dash as nice and easy as it does mine.  This fan actually moves quit a bit of air for how little it is. You can adjust the blower up or down to suit your needs. It is very light probably only weighs a pound.<br />I got this item at a discounted price for a honest review!
B007XGYF50|1|Can't fit 2016 explorer
B00OKCRLUG|3|MiFare Classic. Not writable on Galaxy Note 4 N910C due to hardware incompatibility. Good companion to some older devices, like the Galaxy S3.
B0000AY9V5|5|great wench replaces old one a little bit more lbs.then old one
B00GLLW3AM|1|I have measured current draw with my calibrated fluke 87 multimeter, one light draws 662 mA the other 681 mA which is 7.944 watts and 8.172 watts respectively. this will result in a total amp draw of 1.343 amps. if these lights were as advertised they would draw 1.5 amps each and 3.0 amps total. They flood well but are not super bright. definately not as many lumens as advertised if I had a lux meter I would give you actual numbers. in my opinion I would buy these again but know that you arent getting what is advertised and you need some flowable windshield silicone to make it ip67 waterproof. it will leak around the cord enterance and around the lense that is glued on with super glue. if you want the advertised lumens and wattage buy 2 sets.
B000M5WT16|3|Works.… until the teeth break.
B00BCH51ZO|5|Great brush. Soft for any surface but not for clear coat.
B01092IEEM|5|I bought these for my 2003 Subaru Forester.  They arrived yesterday and I absolutely LOVE them so far!<br /><br />* EXTREMELY EASY TO INSTALL -- I am a petite woman and I installed them all by myself without any major issues.<br /><br />* NICE FIT - The seat covers fit very well, and I am extremely pleased with the clean, new look it gave my rough looking old interior!<br /><br />  * My only &#34;complaint&#34; is that on the back seat bench cover, the seat belt buckles keep the zippers from zipping all the way ... I never have anyone in my backseat so I just tucked those buckles into the seat itself<br /><br />  * The covers for the head rests do not fit as nicely as the seat covers do, but they fit well enough to be both functional and look fabulous.<br /><br />* GREAT PRICE - I could not have gotten front seat covers for this price anywhere local, let alone front AND back seat covers.<br /><br />* DURABILITY -- I will check back in after a few months and update.
B008MLCMSC|5|They are great.  Nicely made and look awesome.  5 STARS!!
B004BTIAOO|5|Works, had to file one of the tangs inside it to make it work with the MSD 6AL2 programmable ignition box. Otherwise no problem, works as designed.
B001V8U3J8|4|Perfect fit for my Minnie Winnie.
B001GJ3DZS|4|A little too big to clean the corner and narrow space.
B00JIBFMY6|1|I received this product at a discount to give an honest and unbiased review. And I can tel you I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it. I mainly wanted it for the seatbelt cutter. I have 5 kids in car seats and this could be so helpful. But. Mine came with a fatal flaw. No blade. I've attached a picture to show this. It's just essentially a hammer to me at this point. Which is good but I really wanted it for the seatbelt cutter. I'm very unimpressed. I will put it in the car but know I still need to keep a razor blade or something else like that in the car as well.
B005SEJTUA|5|Great product. The packaging was real screwy though....Lost some oil in the box during shipment.
B0018GSVG0|5|worked great does rust after some time.  Worked great on all of our rock crawlers
B00B2ASZ18|5|Just what I wanted and received
B00X9IL5RW|5|Exl
