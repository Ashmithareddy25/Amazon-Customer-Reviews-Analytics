B00JYSKBIU|5|Liam Neeson is an alcoholic air marshall.  Within the first few seconds of the film we see this character's battle with his demons, as he pours some liquid courage into his paper coffee cup.  People keep talking to him, but he's the strong, silent and withdrawn type.<br /><br />Within a couple of minutes of take off, he gets a text that could be a credible threat.  This film was engrossing as I wondered why would someone do this.  Of all 150 passengers, I had my suspicions, but I was wrong time and time again.  Everyone and everything is against the air marshall.  Will he be enough to take down the credible threats?<br /><br />Good tension, believability, and non-stop twists and turns.  5 stars!  Liam can do no wrong.  All the movies that I've seen with him have been 4+ stars.
B00HGJ18C2|2|Crashes and resets stat and settings.
B001GUXJQA|5|Harry Bosch is excellent in this \\"wait to the last page murder thriller\\". It was a real page turner with a surprise ending.
B00JVZ0DQG|5|They have very frequent events which helps keep it interesting even though I don't like the leader board ones.  There seem to be a few bugs, but overall fun to play and great graphics.
B00EY8A6BC|5|Great movie if you love magic and has a wonderful twist.

B00910Y1OQ|5|A very fun game, a nice twist on some cool games I've played before, had one data crash but cest la vie
B000002JSP|3|This album perfectly illustrates (as many have taken note) a band on the verge of collapse. Previous albums in the Zeppelin catologe, on more than one occasion, have showcased the group's weakness and limitions (Houses of the Holy; though still a great album). And &quot;In Through The Out Door&quot;, along with such pedestrian preddeccors' as &quot;Presence&quot;, and even to a lesser extent, their masterful &quot;Physical Graffti&quot; (probably their best album, second only to their debut) have illustrated the main flaw in Zeppelin's catologe - (most apparent in their later releases), and that is alot of their songs wind up over-playing themselves to the point of over-repition and monotany (and people think Sabbath were repetive - they at least employed various, unpredictable (progessive), unorthodox time changes to such later lambasted releases (Technical Ecstasy &amp; Never Say Die) Zeppelin on the other hand would constantly play, and play (most notably on this album) at mid-tempo, until the song ends at it's tpyically, predictable dead end finale. And anybody looking for some of the typical Zeppelin bombastic rock, should steer clear of this album. As it's nothing but pop/synth stylings... But, for the more open-minded (or die-hard Zep fan) the album will provide a many interesting moment. Not the best, but certainly not the worst album ever made. In Through The Out Door, though, certainly makes Zeppelin's previous effort, &quot;Presence&quot; seem both more pedestrian, yet more inspired all at the same time.
B0054JZC6E|4|its great I love this game :)) I think that some of the games are kinda dumb but there great :)
0061003646|5|This story has lots of characters and plot twists.  Readers will find Miss Marple and her investigation of the crimes to be highly involving.  A classic story that will be enjoyed by every Agatha Christie fan.
B001NHNG64|3|I've read a few Jack Reacher novels and decided to read them in chronological order.  The first two are really good reads.  I would have given this book 4 stars except for the ending - it seemed like it ended rather quickly and the resolution between the two main characters a little far fetched in the end.
B00T3KN7Q2|5|Great read...really sad.
B002SJIO4A|5|I just finished watching the dvd today, the date of it's release and it is on of the new films that lived up to the hype. It is definitely one of the best films this year and also one of the best in the sci fi category. To be honest, I did not think I was going to like it at first. The first part is shot in documentary style and pretty violent. But once it settles down and focuses on the main characters it when it really kicks into gear. T The special effects are good. But unlike so many films with good special effects, it is a human/alien interest story as well with well written characters too. The alien boy's relationship with his father was my favorite and something that we all can relate too in one way or the other.  I can not remember the last time I felt so good at the end of a movie, knowing I had seen something so entertaining. Highly recommended and definitely a must see.
B00687Q0VC|5|Good history, excellent acting.
B00I8Q77Y0|4|It is fun but really hard so little kids do not get it it is for older more skilled kids.
B0019IB0II|3|I am a neurology nurse and I love to read first hand accounts like this. Unfortunately, I was really hoping for more personal stories, rather than an educational book. It wasn't what I thought it would be as far as an &#34;interesting read,&#34; but I think it would be an excellent resource for someone who might have had a left hemisphere stroke.
B005NFVZTM|1|Couldn't get past the first 30 minutes of this disgusting social engineering and propaganda disguised as a movie to brainwash kids and others. Pure hate from the real haters.  That's what happens when you let a few chosen people take over your academia, media and government and push you out.  No voice to disagree with their junk science, rewritten history and filthy hateful propaganda and lies against some of the most beautiful people in the world.  Tell a BIG enough lie long enough and rewrite history and everyone believes it. Pathetic.

B00004Y6NT|2|I really dont like this album!! The only good song on this <br />album is Lady Writer. Also another good song is Where Do <br />You Think You're Going?. Better off with DS Debut album. <br />I'll give this CD 2 stars because I like Lady Writer and <br />it is one of the best by them.

1401300529|5|\\"The Coldest Winter,\\" David Halberstam's final journalistic tribute to heroes, is a fitting tribute to the men of the oft forgotten war.   Halberstam's lengthy career in journalism and as an author shows in his brilliant writing style that keeps you engrossed in every word. It is not surprising that someone who has written so much about Vietnam, would have a huge resource to draw upon in a work about the Korean War.   The Coldest Winter is a story that needed telling, much the way Herodotus told of the men of Thermopylae or, more recently how Stephen Ambrose told of the men of Easy Company in \\"Band of Brothers.\\"     Halberstam understood well how most Americans ignore the events and outcome of the Korean Conflict; often, that part of history seems better left untold. The Coldest Winter tells this story and it's back stories and even it's substantial post-script. We mustn't forget that South Korea's success today owes a debt to the American and U.N. forces who fought there over half a century ago.   What Halberstam also does in this book is point out the miserable failings of Generals like MacArthur, long-time sacred cows of the World Wars, whose hubris in later life jeopardized the legacy of any truly heroic deeds of their early careers. General Ned Almond is also lambasted for his stubbornness and poor leadership style, which Halberstam shows led to unnecessary losses of American and U.N. forces.   While \\"Coldest Winter\\" is by no means concise as far as a historiography goes, Halberstam has revealed the machinations that led to the war and the egos that sustained it. This is not a blow-by-blow, battlefield-to-battlefield account of the Korean War, much of the latter part of the war is overlooked. But, it covers the broader picture and the political implications and ramifications of American civilian policy versus military instinct in the early 1950s, however poor it may have served us.   The Coldest Winter is a hefty book, at over 650 pages, broken into eleven sections with over 50 chapters, but it reads as fast as it reads brilliant.   This is the first Halberstam book I have read, I regret that it comes only after his passing. There were certainly more great works to come had he not met his untimely death.   REVIEW EVERY BOOK YOU READ, OTHER READERS, PUBLISHERS AND AUTHORS DESERVE YOUR OPINIONS TOO.
0618918248|5|got it as a gift now I need one for myself. excellent read.
B00000FBRE|5|this is one of my favorite cd's, it never gets old. best songs are may 16, after you my friend, owen meaney, and gun in your hand, but everyone is great. buy and enjoy.
0061914177|2|Its a quick read.  I like that its a fast paced approach to helping put a fire underneath you for getting you to go out there and 'crushing it' in your next business endeavor.  The only thing I don't like, is its push to sell using social media.  I believe this is backwards.  Social media is a tool that is helpful once you establish a fan base/customer base.  No one 'likes' a fan page on facebook without already being a fan of said author/musician/whatever.  No one follows a twitter account unless that person is already popular.  His approach in this book is backwards and time consuming if you think social media will make you a millionaire.  This book also left out a lot of the how-to's some would look for in establishing a book.  If you are looking to make money as an affiliate marketer, think again.  You'll need thousands of unique visitors daily, with only a percentage clicking your ads, with another smaller percentage actually buying the product and on top of all of this, your actually only making 4-6% per sale if your lucky.  If you want to make money online with a business that works, I'll cut it to the chase for you:  Create your own information product.  Not just an ebook, but a product.  A product is a collection of ebooks around one particular niche topic that you are well versed in.  Create a website around this through a blog, over deliver (creating more value than what the book is actually worth) and make sure its top notch quality.  Example would be to create a 100 dollar information product (a collection of a few ebooks around your topic), but under sell it for 30-50.  Its easier to sell this than say a ebook for 10 bucks.  Just my two cents!  After you establish a business, than you can use social media to help spread your business.  But don't use social media first.  Its a waste of time.    I also read \\"Social Media is Bulls***\\" by B.J. Mendelson gave me the insight on this using real world examples
B001UREJWM|3|Musically superb...louder drums & grind please...  Lyrically is Dio at his usual...he's had better days; I love his early solo stuff  Vocally sounds great for his age...TOO LOUD in the sound mix making this a Dio album with BS guest players. H&H/MR was a BAND; Dehumanizer Dio started bitching and egos flared. Here Dio gets the BS album he's always wanted and thinks he deserves with him WAY out front of the sound mix. I swear there are places where the background riffing turns down when Ronnie comes on.    Was never too hot re Ozzy (but own it all mainly for Iommi); love the first Dio/Sabbath material; like a bunch of the Iommi-only remaining as Sabbath era; love much of the Martin era. Disappointed overall its OK...more Iommi and slightly quieter Ronnie. Thanks.
B00785P2QC|3|good game. fun to play. instructions are easy to folks and pretty simple. I recommend it to all people who like building stuff.
1891252089|5|I've used David's book and videos since I started practicing Ashtanga and they are great. I've also had the pleasure of attending his teacher training course and must say that he's a genuinely nice guy. <br /> <br />Buy is practice manual and go to his workshops if you can.
0553582011|5|best set of book ever...I will read the whole set again when the next two are ready.<br />I could just read this story forever without end...the thought that it will end someday is heartbreaking....<br />I worry that he will not get thru summer...as the seasons are long...
B007ZGO7EM|4|Its fast and easy to use and a waste of money any other calculator wold suffice but its fine and weird looking
0316212377|5|I do love the \\"Culture\\" novels. They represent interesting ways of looking at interactions of alien civilizations. And, of course, they feature the Minds... those AIs who make up the real power of the Culture. I have had many a good snicker or outright laugh at Banks names for the Minds (check Wikipedia for a list). The keen intellects have a taste for whimsy, but a very, very serious side as enforcers for the Culture, especially those associated with Special Circumstances. I am pleased that Banks spends more time now with the Minds. His earlier stories are quite good, but he really has been taking off in the last few books.<br /><br />My title refers to the fact that when I read some of the text, I hear the narrator from \\"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy,\\" especially when Banks capitalizes words in sentences. For example I might write that the story revolves around A Really Big Secret, but when Banks writes something like that, you grin. (Well, I do.) Probably also has to do with Brit phrases creeping in now and then. All good with me. There is definitely a lot of humor in the book. Remember, Luke, Leia & Han in the garbage compartment? Banks goes one better (or should I say worse?) here, and it is perfectly plausible.<br /><br />The truth about composer's intent for the piece of music called \\"The Hydrogen Sonata\\" has such irony as to be both sad and terribly funny. Banks has a lot of nice touches in the book. But the book is, as my title indicates, mostly serious. The humor is secondary or tertiary.<br /><br />The book is a minor travelogue. Some very interesting places are visited. Imagine a race like McDevitt's Monument Builders, but building on a planetary scale. We visit an Orbital (a Ringworld type object), where in a remote desert section, an AI is building an analog to a waterworks... A place where some race drilled  holes through mountains to turn them into giant organ pipes played by the wind... A repository of a race's artifacts, including... no, you'll have to read that part...<br /><br />But there is this background of a race opting out of \\"The Real\\" to the \\"Sublime.\\" This is, in some ways like the transcendence in \\"Fire in the Deep,\\" but different. It is literally making a jump, as a race, to another dimension, where, to use the expression from another book, the individual minds (biological or AI) are \\"vastened.\\" Banks has mentioned the Sublimed before, but we get a little closer look this time around, just as in \\"Surface Detail\\" we got a look at \\"life\\" in a Virtual Reality.<br /><br />It's mostly a one-way trip. Supposedly everything is better... but is it? Communications with the Sublimed tend to be scarce. It's a definite \\"leap of faith\\" and our story takes place in the last 24 days before a race of humanoids (Gzilt) who helped found the \\"The Culture\\" (but who never joined it) takes the plunge to Sublime. By the way, Banks' choice of the the word Sublime is sublime!<br /><br />That's when a ship from the inheritors of a race who had left some of their technology to the Gzilt, shows up. And their message is that the main text that help guide the Gzilt in building their civilization was a fraud. Murder happens, and a cover-up is attempted... But those snoopy Culture Minds get wind, and want to know the truth... and off we go!<br /><br />Did I forget to mention that a very old humanoid, alive when the Culture was founded, is a key to the truth? Banks tries to address the question of how and more particularly why, someone would want to live that long (over 9000 years at the time of this book). There is some philosophical meat in the book, including the usual questions arising from making duplicates of one's self, and can one distinguish a simulation from reality.<br /><br />There is plenty of action and many more interesting ideas than I have yet mentioned. Readers of Banks earlier Culture books know how different the Minds can be from each other. It appears that not only can the Minds become eccentrics, but thatthey can \\"go native\\" with non-Culture civilizations.<br /><br />So many ideas! Banks reminds me why I fell in love with science fiction so long ago.
B006LSZECO|5|Disturbingly clever.  Even when you think you have it figured out....things get more twisted.<br />Not nearly as predictable as you think it's going to be.
B00CEZJT2E|5|I got this battery pack as a smaller backup to my main battery pack (Astro E3), and I love it. It's compact and slim, fitting easily into a pocket. I would have liked the built in cord to have a narrower plastic base so I can charge my phone within its case, but it does come with a separate cord which does fit nicely with my Spigen case on. The separate cord that comes with the Anker chargers seem to be poorly made however, because both the cords from this battery and the one for the Astro E3 no longer charges my phone. The joint where the cord connects the the USB plug tip eventually loosen exposing the internal wires which then eventually break. Since this happened on both cords, I can only assume it is the quality of the cords. I currently use the charging cord that came with my phone, and that has been working great until I can find another cord that will fit my phone with its case. If not for the cord issue (both the built-in and the separate) I would have given this 5 stars. I would recommend this battery pack, just don't count on the cord to last.<br /><br />Update: Not 3 days after posting my review, AnkerDirect Customer Service contacted me on their own to send me replacement cables, which they were able to get to me in 2 days. I had not contacted them first because most other companies have given me the run around whenever I have tried to get service after having paid and bought their products. Not Anker! As stated in my initial review, their battery packs are solid and now I know their customer service is solid as well. With that I take back my initial rating of 3 stars, and give this product as well as my experience 5 stars. Count me as a loyal Anker customer that will be buying again.

B008Y6P7XM|5|A perfect Tom Waits roll. A great movie.
B0007YBMA6|5|As a life-long horror/monster/sci-fi enthusiast, I would highly recommend this Japaneese two-disc set to any fellow genre fan reading this.  The images are really clear, not murky like the vhs and television version we've been accustomed to for years.  All the gorey (funny?) bits that were taken out years ago for 'moral' reasons are included.  With the addition of the also out-of-print 'Son of Kong' on the second disc, this unique package is well worth the investment, and a lot cheaper than an airline ticket to Tokyo in hopes of tracking it down!
B00006LLNU|4|I was led to Sigur Ros by way of Mum.  Several reviewers seemed to put the two groups in the same category, but I don't see it.  Sigur Ros is much darker and simply more majestic.  Sigur Ros' music seems much more influenced by what I imagine Iceland to be environmentally.  The music builds and swells to a point where you think it can't get any bigger...and it does, quietly.  Can't understand a word the singer is saying, but much like early REM, it really doesn't matter.  His voice is more instrument than anything else.<br />This band's work is impressive.  I will definitely check out their other discs.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Love this game! I played it on the iPod and now months later on the kindle fire and it never gets old.  You won't be able to put it down.

0385349947|4|I bought the book after hearing Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in conversation with Google chairman Eric Schmidt at the Computer History Museum. I'd recommend this book for any career woman who wants to climb the \\"jungle gym\\", as Sandberg describes it, as opposed to a \\"corporate ladder\\".  Men should read this book to learn where they may fail women and what to do about it.<br /><br />She openly discusses her fears and luck in her successful career. She also mentions traits of other successful women. Being near Stanford University, she was able to tap some of the world's best researchers on gender inequalities.  The acknowledgement list is long and distinguished.  There are copious footnotes at the end of the book and references.  This book is most like the [[ASIN:0743222253 Living History]].<br /><br />Some of my values and experiences mirror those of Sheryl, some are quite different, in part because I went to a school and college for females only, so it's a book that lingers in your brain as you try to develop a strategic path for yourself.<br /><br />Here are some of the observations that Sheryl makes and actions she takes, backed up by research, and my thoughts:<br /> - more men than women want to be the President or have high goals - I found this surprising as at ten years old I thought I'd be on the steps of 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister in the UK<br /><br /> - women tend to be fearful in asking for promotions - I didn't have a clue that you were supposed to ask when I started work - I thought that like college and school you'd be promoted annually and that a boss's job was to make you a star - the only promotion I've had I asked for after advice from a senior manager - so the book is really valuable here in telling women how to get on in life<br /><br /> - Sheryl left a job at McKinsey after a year - I'd never have done that at her age as a core value above almost anything else for me was loyalty and I believed I could turn any situation into a good one (found out later this is not necessarily true)- - another valuable lesson<br /><br /> - people like to fit in - I've always wanted to be unique and differentiated from everyone around me - she tells a story about her son wearing a blue T-shirt on St Patrick's Day instead of green and her husband turning this into a lesson that it's OK not to be different - at least he wasn't wearing orange:)<br /><br /> - Sheryl urges people to take risks with their jobs - it depends on the risk - generally this is a good message, but it could spell disaster<br /><br /> - negotiate - good advice<br /><br /> - Sheryl worked 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. before she had a family - a good tip<br /><br /> - Sheryl tells women they can have a family and successful career - I'm not sure this is true for all<br /><br /> - most senior female CEOs have spouses - direct contrast to my school, where teachers without husbands were revered - even having a husband for me means distraction from career, at a girls' school I never learned at an early age to handle both work and dates<br /><br /> - successful men tend to be liked in the workplace, successful women tend to have problems - too true - thanks Sheryl for researching this and explaining it clearly<br /><br /> - women need to use \\"we\\" more at work - my first instinct is repulsion - it wouldn't occur to me to think like that - a lesson to learn for future encounters<br /><br /> - be brave - essential - something I'm just learning now<br /><br /> - women need to promote their successes - great advice for the US - it probably doesn't come naturally to many immigrants and in other countries it may be frowned upon - however, reading [[ASIN:000745662X Path to Power]] and [[ASIN:0007456638 Downing Street Years]] I believe that women should be pushy despite the culture if they are to succeed<br /><br /> - how not to find a mentor - totally agree, you'll make connections if you go about your business rather than looking for mentors<br /><br />There's plenty more in the book on being authentic, being a mother (masses on that - not of interest to me  - being the eldest of 4, I decided a job was much more interesting than having children at the age of 11 and have no regrets) and finding mentors.<br /><br />After reading the book I believe that Sheryl's hard work was rewarded early in her career. She also tried hard to be liked. It enabled her to get a good internship, which led to trust from great bosses, which led to good jobs, which helped her to be proud of her accomplishments, which gave her the nerve to call Eric Schmidt for a job at Google, then recruiters approached her for a position at Facebook.<br /><br />The book has a call to action and I believe the LeanIn Circles will offer great experiences for women. Revenues from the book support the LeanIn non-profit that seeks to empower women.<br /><br />This is a great gift for a college student - male or female.  It's also great for a book group.ore in the book on being authentic, being a mother (masses on that - not of interest to me  - being the eldest of 4, I decided a job was much more interesting than having children at the age of 11 and have no regrets) and finding mentors.<br /><br />After reading the book I believe that Sheryl's hard work was rewarded early in her career.

6304508611|5|Stunning performances from an all-star cast (especially from Sissy Spacek as the sweet Carrie and Piper Laurie as he psychotic mother), a marvelously adapted script from the original novel, a beautiful music score and Brian De Palma's incredible visuals help to make this chilling film what it is: an absolutely terrifying classic of modern horror.
B00DR0PDNE|3|Works like it says it does.  Setup was simple. Worked flawlessly on my Android phone and my Wife's iPhone.<br /><br />For me, it's like a neat idea in search of a problem to solve.  What you can watch is extremely limited. That may change, so I'm not getting rid of it, but still...<br /><br />Issues:<br />You still have to fumble with the remote for the TV in order to turn it on and adjust the volume and change the input.  You might as well just get a Roku and a programmable remote.<br /><br />Should allow for headphones through the smart device instead of routing the sound to the TV.<br /><br />If you can play it on your smart device, using headphones or not, why not just do that?<br /><br />Tried to set it up on my desktop computer, but it wouldn't work because it said it needed WiFi.  WTF? My computer is 2 feet from the router and is hardwired to it for speed and convenience, but apparently if I want to send something from it to the Chromecast, I need to buy another USB WiFi adapter to transmit the 2 feet at a much slower rate just to make this work.
B0045HCJQW|5|Lurking behind the great and continuous comedy, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, helped along with the invaluable James Stuart and companion, portray a valuable lesson about how to relate differently to a spouse than to others -- that there is a difference between being worshiped and being loved.
B000GWE44U|1|This is Mar 2014. I have ATT broadband, and I never had problems with my connection. I rented the non-HD version. The loading is so slow, it plays for 10 seconds and stops for 1 minute. This is no way to watch a movie! I could have given it 0 stars if there is the option. I switched to google play movies and watched it on youtube. Sorry Amazon, I have always been a loyal customer of Amazon, but unless you fix the connection issues, I won't be coming back. By the way, the slowness of the connection in  Amazon.com started around Feb 2014, you should go figure why this is so. And possibly disable the user from renting movies if the connection drops below 3 bars, for there is no way to watch a movie with a bad connection. This leaves a bad taste in the mouth. No more amazon videos for me.
0316113506|5|I enjoyed this book. It's important that people understand the exercise is not just a tool for weight loss, but a critical component of a well-functioning brain and body.  If you want to enjoy optimal health, and that includes mental happiness, then you need to exercise. Not just to lose weight, but because so many aspects of our health, longevity, and happiness are tied to the biological responses to exercise and movement.
B00AREIAI8|5|It's so fun and it would be fun to horse riders. Good graphics, you can play 100% free, visit other people's horses, you can compete in shows (show jumping), overall great game.
0061537969|1|All of the sexual innuendos has this book trying to reach an audience that he shouldn't be reaching...kids.  It is a shame that this book was on the reading list for a public school. The author, Garth Stein, constantly brings himself up in the book instead of having an interesting plot. I would pass on this one.

B00HBR9OWU|5|Love this game it's so addictive that you won't be able to put it down. They need to give up more rubies though you need so many.
B000XUBFE2|5|This was such a great read. Best book I have read in a long time. Highly recommend this book to everyone.
0385349947|2|this book is easy to read and I was eager to see if I could learn something useful to apply to the generally toxic, chauvinist and dysfunctional corporate environment.  She indicates a lot of truth about how women are treated or the difficulties women face in corporate America.  BUT her perspective is from the point of view of a woman that had a good start, good networking, good family coaching, good family examples, etc. and the problem resided within her.  She fails, in my opinion, to view the global problem for women in the working place and more importantly to offer suggestions on how to tackle these problems and career obstacles.  She failed to see the problems that women secure of themselves and with strong personality face.  Or the steep, difficult, full of obstacles path that women with not initial networking in place have to face.  Men do to, but for women due to a male dominated working place, it is harder.  Thus, in a nutshell, her recommendations apply to just a segment of the female population, which seems to be women with good start and lack real confidence.
B0054JZC6E|5|this is a really great game to play. it has many cool games to unlock. it has kept me and my friend entertained for days.
B000MXFPH8|5|I read that this was made in Japan and that was one of the reasons I purchased this product.<br />I used today and we all had a wonderful time. as it is very easy to use. I looked at a few youtube videos before hand.<br /><br />however the box says MADE IN CHINA. it was covered under a upc sticker.<br />I am disappointed. just be honest with customer product is made in China. don't mislead us. we don't like that.
B009ZQC7MY|4|enjoyed this season!
B00B4VXQC8|1|Though it says a review must contain at least twenty words, the reaction to this can be summed up in two:  \\"OUCH\\" and \\"WHY?\\"  Painful as ever to hear more than 2 notes and if anyone can come up with a reason how this collection of hacks is still allowed near a recording studio, you can start to answer the \\"WHY?\\" part.  Every single attempt at music by this NJ embarrassment has been to try to copy anything that Springsteen had done, be it harder rock than these spandex/hair banders could ever dream of (even with noted song doctor hack Desmond Child finishing all their songs for them), a feeble attempt at Americana/country and now another johnny-come-lately (or is it 'jonni' for the spelling-challenged fan base?) effort at social commentary after \\"Wrecking Ball\\" set the bar higher than these clowns can even see through a telescope.  From the people who brought you the shopping bag-inspired \\"Have a Nice Day\\" comes this collection of flat, banal, tuneless dross that will be lapped up by the females who can only explain their popularity by \\"how cute they are\\" or \\"they are such nice guys\\" which only adds to the tone deaf explanation for any success achieved outside of friends and family.  And after all these years of playing the tough guy poser with the phony growl, isn't it about time he passed that kidney stone?  Because singing every note like you are in agony only passes that agony on to the rest of us.  Take a cue from Bruce's song and go \\"Bye Bye Johnny\\" please.
B0040JHLI6|5|I was able to get rid of my Super Feet inserts because of the great support that this shoe provides.  Consisent, true sizing.  Good selection of colors.
B006LSZECO|5|Loved the book! It was slow at the beginning BUT once it got going it was great. Always kept you wondering what was going to happen next. Recommend to all my friends.
B004TI1WME|5|Best calculator I've ever used on any operating system or actual calculator.
B00KA87GCW|3|Same old &amp;#34;plant, harvest, clear, build, and expand&amp;#34; game. Nothing innovative, but nothing bad.
B005KIQDYE|5|My granddaughter loved this toy.  Would definitely recommend it.
B00ARHAAZ6|5|This is the first book I've ever read of Brandon Sanderson, and he just became one of my new favorite authors. Other reviewers have done a great job giving you a synopsis of the story; I'm here to tell you that his writing and character development is solid.<br /><br />Told from a perspective of an 18-year old guy, it is a refreshing change from all of the 1st person YA female-driven books that have flooded the market in the past 5 years. Don't get me wrong - I love reading those novels, but it is nice to be in a guy's head sometimes. There is great character development, and I appreciate that the characters didn't deviate from what we were originally told about them. Many YA authors present a normal person who ends up doing something so contrary to the behavior and attitude the reader was first given, and I believe that is due to trying to get quickly to the story without taking time to flesh out the motives behind why they are all of a sudden deviating from who they supposedly are. Sanderson, on the other hand, gives his characters depth and they grow with their circumstances, but he writes them in such a way that the choices the characters make at the end of the book line up with what we already know about them. And he does it quickly, concisely, and flawlessly.<br /><br />This might fall under a dystopian genre, but the focus is not on how this 'new' society came to be, but rather on what a small group of 'ordinary' people are willing to do and change to be truly free.
1449433251|5|I love this set! I love how each strip looks like it's been cut out and pasted onto the pages. I'm a graphic artist and the layout is AWESOME. I've loved Calvin & Hobbes for years and I'm so glad I finally now own the complete set. Thank you Mr. Watterson for the best strip ever.
B003VVFGWC|4|I enjoy watching!
B002U6CJCO|4|Good continue action of previous episodes takes up where last left off makes a great whole series to watch at once.
B00L9B7IKE|5|What a well written, gripping, and interesting book! I have recommended this book to all of my friends who enjoyed Gone Girl and The Husband's Srcret. I found myself drawn into this book such that  I was finding every excuse to read, and finished it in less than a week. The author just does such an excellent job of getting into the mind of the characters and making you understand them, even the ones who have flaws that you may have assumed you could never relate to, while also setting up a very interesting mystery. You can't go wrong with reading this book if you enjoy a good mystery or thriller. I can't wait to see more from this author.
B004P1JEWU|5|If you were sucked in to the story in the first two books, this third instalment will leave you gasping for more! Murder, mayhem, political machinations - it's all there and keeps you turning the pages late into the night. A definite &#34;can't put down&#34; book. Luckily, I was on holidays when I read it or I may have had to contemplate a couple of sickies so there were no rude interruptions to this gripping tale.
1582432678|5|I loved this book. The character of the mother was revealed so well in the form of letters to her husband. The evolution of the criminal son in the letters along with the loss of the marriage and ultimately everything was just so inevitable. I kept wanting to shake Eve and tell her to run, run. But she didn't and that was the thing that caused the most afterthought. I wanted to know what happened over the years she visited her son, if a relationship ever formed. For all the darkness, it seemed to me there was a tiny ray of hope at the end. But this book will stay with me for a long time.
B00UPSUYU8|5|Liked it befor, like it now.
B00000DGUY|4|Great album of any fan of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler.  The Brothers in Arms song has always been my favorite.
B00FX8F6VM|5|Katy Perry rocks! What can I say... I love this song and I am glad I was able to down load it through Amazon.
B0086DBE62|5|I enjoyed this movie. It is \\"campy fun\\" and easy on the eyes. I will enjoy comparing the Seven Dwarves in this movie with the heroes of \\"The Hobbit\\" movies.
B008JFUNKU|5|My husband is a merchant mariner and we followed the story closely as it was happening.  The book is incredible and insightful and the movie is well made.  They got the details right as far as life at sea and the cast was great.  I preferred hearing Capt. Phillips' insight and perspective the way the book was written which couldn't be captured in the movie, but the ending was so captivating and emotional, very well done.
B009ZQC7MY|5|love it got new kindle fire for christmas started watching almost everyday couldn't wait to watch it daliy when is season 4 going to start ???
B002VGFZII|4|Once again not the best movie out but then again not the worst. The younger generation may enjoy it more so the myself.(senior citizen).
0553801473|5|G.R.R. Martin definitely clears up most of what is missing from feast for crows. I cant wait to read the next one!
B00BYKIKJS|5|E-A-G-L-E-S
B000JML7EC|5|When first published this was considered an exciting story of English pirates. Today it reads as an interesting insight into old English culture and an interesting sea tale. Worth the read if you are interested in fictional history
B00ESB6GBY|3|I Love HIMYM, but this season is focused on one weekend and it is taking a long time to get to the Wedding which we already saw parts of last season.  I am thankful that this is it, because you can tell the writers, the actors, and the crew of tired of this universe.  I would like the themes to hurry up a little and see a lot more about the meeting of the mother.  She's great, she just needs more air time.  I can not wait for the season finale, because this present has too many bows on it.  I want the show to stop tying moments up and start getting to the good stuff.
B00FPOSDGY|4|I lurve me a good, unreliable narrator who manages to evoke complicated feelings in me as I read-- both sympathetic and unsympathetic.<br /><br />Cadence Sinclair Harris is the granddaughter of a blonde, democrat rich old boy who owns his own island and built houses for each of his daughters. She's spent every summer on the island, once in a while boating over to Martha's Vineyard for fudge and supplies.<br /><br />She and the older two cousins, along with almost-step cousin, Gat, are thick as thieves. But now Cadence is almost set to graduate high school...only she's drugged up out of her mind, her mother is suddenly over-protective, and she can't...quite....remember what happened two summers ago at the family island. And none of her cousins are returning her emails.<br /><br />The stories Cadence tells to herself provide clues to the real undercurrents tugging at the Sinclair family, and as parts of the mystery are revealed through Cadence's broken voice, less and less it matters what really happened and more and more it matters how families can stand together or pull themselves apart.<br /><br />Cadence is whiny, and self-deceiving, and self-centered, and clueless, and you still find yourself rooting for her. I read this one in almost one evening as it sucks you in with shifting realities and an almost reality-tv picture of rich white family life, King Lear-style.
B008JMKN4Y|5|This book was good. I enjoyed it. There was no sappiness. Even though these are young people, it felt like adult problems. There were parts of this book that reminded me of an 80's movie.<br /><br />Spoiler: Travis in the lunch room starts dancing on the tables for one reason or another in the lunch room and everyone cheers him on. Something you'd see in an 80's movie.
B00NEQRNVG|5|I do love this series but hate all the waiting. I know there are a lot of people and things involved but there has to be some limits. I would still recommend this book if you have read the others. You might want to wait for book 5 before you read it though. No true ending. This book was more of an emotional roller coaster leading up to how they are going to move forward or apart. Must Read!!!
B0007M22TI|4|I purchased this for my husband who doens't miss Celtic Woman when they are on PBS. He was very pleased.
B00BGIC4I6|3|I think that this is a good movie but the beginning of it is way more funny then the middle and end. The beginning (if you're looking for a comedy) doesn't disappoint but it starts to wane, and get less funny, and towards the end it almost turns tragic. I think it is more real life then comic. I liked it okay.
B0002VEPRQ|5|I'm in my 50's and watch this film annually.  If you start watching it when you're young enough, watching this film becomes a foray into another little world.  It's a comforting escape to watch in January when the parties are over and the pockets are empty.
B0054JZC6E|5|mucho fun, yes. I like how there all spinoffs of older games. I like the sushi game even though I suck at it.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I would play this game on my cellphone. To say I was happy when it came out on kindle would be a slight understatement. I love this game...it is fun but the higher up you go then it starts to get a little more challenging.
B004GJDQT8|5|Always something affordable to buy.
0316227706|3|This was bought as a Christmas gift for a dog-loving family. It made the recipients smile, and was passed around the room, with everyone wanting a look.  Its a great &#34;coffee table&#34; addition.
0425267725|4|Ok but a bit hard to keep characters separate.
B0091REZMW|3|It's ok. Kinda confusing.
B008IJTFYW|5|It's unique because it lets you combine different relaxing sounds and there are so many to choose from. I love the timer feature-l used it to go to sleep last night.
B000CNE164|5|Good music.. Bought for grandmother.. She loves it..
B006N57PXG|5|Read all of Stroud's Bartimeaus and wish there were more.  Bartimeaus is  a conflicted , loveable daemon  with an interesting view of both his worlds.  Read and enjoy
B0068853O6|5|Awesome movie
B005ZOBNOI|5|Definite page turner
B0055SWM08|5|fun game with a lot of challenges. some puzzles take a lot of thought to complete perfectly. worth the download for sure.
B000001EUR|4|This Album contains two of my favorites from the &quot;latter era&quot;, <BR>Rock You Like A Hurricane and Still Lovin You.  I think I like Blackout a bit better, but Scorpions fans will not go wrong with this Cd.   I'm seeing them in concert this summer and am eagerly awaiting it.   I can't think of a better song to kick it off with than Hurricane.      Overall a great rockin album with a real top ballad too.
B000002HRE|5|I liked this cd just as much as Load. It was good and it seemed that Metallica was experimenting with this album just like Load. I will not write that long of a review because i will probably end up saying the same  things that i said for Load. i am also very tired. The good songs on this  album are Fuel, The Memory Remains, The Unforgiven 2, Devil's Dance, and  Prince Charming. Get it if you are a fan.
B004JN1D2I|5|I can't seem to put it down!  My husband is starting to wonder what I REALLY have on my Kindle!
B0055PGUYU|5|One of the most interesting and practical books I have read in ages. I bought copies for all the adult members of my leadership team and copies for all the graduates in my life!
B00FRQ32N4|5|Awesome
B00821OX98|4|Really like the character development. Not a lot of action, but when things happen they are unexpected and due to the development, I genuinely cared about the people. Unlike other sci-if attempts that rely on effects and neglect the details.
B0089LOG02|5|Great story and very well written.
0316066524|4|Damn this book is long, but enjoyable
B000SJJCX4|2|I quickly replaced this with a Boss TU-3 pedal tuner which is much more accurate. Some behringer products are not worth the investment.
B003ZK58WM|1|Amazon, you have got some nerve!  I bought the book for my Kindle because I really, really wanted to read it and didn't have time to go to the bookstore or library, plus, I didn't want to have to lug a 1000 page book to/from work.  That's the real reason, the size of this book.  I am not buying a Kindle book for more that $9.99.  That was the price that was more or less promised when I purchased my Kindle, now, you've gone and screwed everyone who bought a Kindle.  It's not right.  If the publishers raise the price, you should tell them you cannot sell it for that price, people won't buy it, then, they will be forced to lower the price.  Come on, give us all a break.  We spent a lot of money for the Kindle and now we are expected to spend even more.  I'm on my way to the library for the best sellers that are over $9.99.  Amazon, the publishers and authors have lots more money than I will ever have!  I'm really enjoying the book but the price has put me in a bad mood.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|A must for my granddaughter. Good quality. Perfect size. This grandmother rocks!!
B009C7ZQM4|5|Did well but slowed my kindle some.
B00J59ZKV6|5|Loved the book and liked the movie. Good special effects.
B00FAPF5U0|4|This is a very entertaining game. Your lives replenish quickly enough that you don't need to pay to keep playing as long as you have a little patience.
B003UBTX6S|2|*****NO SPOILERS HERE*****<br /><br />I'm just not impressed. Like in the story it is right or left, yes or no, death or life, good or evil, and you are waiting for those hugely important decisions to be made but there is always a weird loop hole to get out of making that decision and they aren't even good ones that make sense in the story. It's the like writers had it all planned out, then they just did whatever they could to end it.  It was slowly slowly slowly slowly leading up to this big ending that was supposed to be a big deal but it wasn't and it just didn't make sense at the ending. Super slow over allllll. I am only continuing the series because I have the next book already.
B00N1HONIO|4|A bit creepy, for my 13 year old.  But he says it's a great game!
B00881VLCE|4|There are great puzzles, but, again, it would be easier to work on the computer rather than the Kindle.  The Kindle is much better for reading books.
B00J1IQUYM|5|Scary.  Commanding.  Riveting.  Definitely a read you will want to put down from time to time, and also want to pick right back up again.  I didn't want it to end.
B000021XS0|1|I was surprised to see such a high ranking of this album.  I thought it was trash by the time I was halfway through it, the first day of owning it.  I don't like the departure from the original style of the first 3 CDs.  This album ranges from sappy crap with horrible lyrics to nu-metal riffs that belong in radio pop metal.  What makes this album desirable to the other reviewers, I have no idea.  Maybe they didn't like Dream Theater before this so they didn't know what the first CDs were like.      I hate the theme of this album as well and I think the story is useless, horrible, and delivers and \\"in your face\\" spiritual message or total garbage that makes me want to visit the restroom.  I wish Dream Theater would have stuck with the original format where they were absolutely *amazing,* and the songwriting was second to none.
0545128285|3|My \\"new\\" book arrived with a coffee ring stain on the title page.  I called to complain and told them it was supposed to be a Christmas gift.  They said they would next day mail a replacement.  I told the it had to get there by midnight Dec. 23 as we were going out of town at 7 a.m. Dec. 24.  Guess what? It didn't get there on time and I had not Christmas gift to give.  It was on my doorstep when I arrived home Dec. 27, but it was too late to give as a gift.  Inexcusable!
B00E8KLWB4|5|it's a fun game to play . hate that you run out of energy so fast tho, good free game
B00JBGWP3Y|5|Many people who rated this movie low was probably hoping that it would be Biblically correct, and they were wrong. That's what makes the story in this movie great. It gives an alternative interpretation to what is written in the Bible. The movie shows how humans have become brutal and deadly to the natural order, and in the process have dehumanized themselves. There are many parallels in this movie to our society today. Those who believe that the Earth's resources and nature were meant for humans to plunder and exploit will hate this movie. Those who believe in the opposite will love it as I did!
B0019IB0II|4|This book was a great help to me to help understand my recent<br />stroke.<br /> The author is a master writer.<br /><br />Dan

B007IXWL2C|5|Enjoyed this book...read them all...loved that I was just a click away from ordering...didn't have to go to the book store...thanks for convenience...always!
B00DURGZHW|3|The movie was going well 'til it got to the end. This movie has a very lame ending. Glad I didn't pay for it.
B00004WG2F|5|This movie is a one-of-a-kind epic into the philosophies of people living in a bygone era.  The focus brings into reality a son marked by his father's dissolution while serving in the army which lead to his involvement in trying to force the American indians from their rightful homes.  The father's disgust with the government's intention sends him to settle in an isolated area (beautiful) to raise his family.  His son's relationships with him and each other lead to totally separated ideas of government and it's right to enforce.  The scenery is beautiful, the characters strong and the traumas real.  Great story of our nations beginnings.

B004MC0FO8|5|I have always been  bad at naming songs or artist that I hear at various places daily.  This app works better than I thought it would and it's so easy to use.  Now I never have to ask other people the name of songs or artist performing them.
B0084AZXKK|5|more inflicting then the movie wish I would of read it years ago. loved his writings. miss so much with movies. lucky I went back to read the classics.
B00ILHW6AG|4|Stephen King comes back to his time-honored writing style with Revival. I was caught up in the book from the beginning and continued to wonder what could happen next to the end. The characters were compelling, the slide from normal to fearful was easy, and the transitions all made sense. It was a relief to see that &#34;Mr. Mercedes&#34; was not representative of a new phase for Mr. King.
1603425381|5|There's nothing as valuable to me as a resource that can be visited again and again. I am revisiting crochet after years of knitting and Edie's work does not disappoint. There are more options here than I will ever use, I'm certain, but a girl can dream, right?
B006LSZECO|4|Enjoyable read with lots of twists.  The author did an excellent job of leading the reader through the minds of both main characters adding surprises and twists along the way.  The characters were believable and clever.  The only down side was that about 3/4 through the book, I predicted the outcome and was a bit disappointed to find it did indeed end the way I expected.  All in all I would recommend this book.
1452115567|5|The world would be a better place if everyone had a companion like Maddie. I've had the privilege meeting Maddie and she's a sweet pup. Her owner and author, Theron, is one of the greatest people I know. You Need This Book!

B0042U94UQ|5|My four year old granddaughters and I loved watching this! They loved the minions! A lot of fun was had by all!
B00003CXCT|2|I honestly don't know what to rate this collection.  On one hand I want to give it a five star rating.  I, like many others, grew up with Star Wars and have been waiting for the original trilogy to appear on DVD.  On the other hand, I am quite saddened by many of the changes.  To sum it up, I am rather conflicted...So I will just list the good and bad and let you be the judge. <br /> <br />THE GOOD: <br /> <br />Well, the picture quality is superb.  I was completely blown away by how well they remastered these films.  They look like they were made yesterday.  Also, the sound is absolutely stunning.  If you have a nice surround sound system and a big television and watch any of the 3 with the lights off, you could quite easily be fooled into thinking that you were in a state-of-the-art theatre (I tried it out on a smaller television with a mono speaker and it still sounds good so don't worry if you don't have a fancy set-up).  Also there is a decent commentary track with Lucas and others (including Carrie Fischer) talking about the movies.  It is kind of fun to listen to and informative. <br /> <br />THE BAD: <br /> <br />Frankly, after the picture and sound quality, I was extremely dissapointed.  This was supposed the be the DEFINITIVE DVD set, but unfortunately it isn't.  The special features aren't really that great.  There have been so many news shows, made-for-tv-specials, and special effects programs on television, you would think that they would have included more of it on the fourth disc.  Instead, it is just some mediocre documentary footage.   <br /> <br />The worst thing about this collection though is that the \\"original\\" original trilogy was not included.  I remember on the Abyss and T2 DVDs, there were 2 or 3 versions of each film...on each DVD.  I kind of feel jipped.  They could have put the original, the first Special Edition, and now the Definitive versions all on the same DVD for each film, but didn't.  I also feel that it is false advertising to promote these discs as just Star Wars when it is yet another special edition.  This kind of leads me to believe that the Lucas camp will eventually release the \\"original\\" original trilogy to milk the consumer of even more money instead of just including all version into this set like most other sets do.   <br /> <br />Now I know that most people are complaining about the original, unmodified versions not being availabe.  Then everyone else is complaining about the PEOPLE complaining about how the original, unmodified versions are not available.  All that I have to say is that we have lost too many original films through the years.  Look at Metropolis.  It has been chopped and edited to peices, and we are still trying to peice it back together into its original form.  The same goes for many films for yesteryear.  I have a feeling that the same thing will happen with Star Wars eventually.  The VHS copies are wearing out.  The original celluloid is wearing out.  If these versions are all that we have in the future then film historians will be trying to obtain the Laserdisc versions for prosterity. It would be much better if they unmodified originals were in full circulation also.  <br /> <br />I  honestly don't have a problem with Lucas screwing with his own films (I don't like the changes, but he does have the right).  I do have a problem with not releasing the original versions though.  I would have loved to compare the old with the new.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, everyone reading this probably already knows what Star Wars is all about.  Everyone already knows that changes have been made.  So you now have to ask yourself...Do you feel like spending 40+ dollars for a highly modified version of Star Wars that looks and sounds good but is lacking in special features? <br /> <br />If you are into Star Wars for the big booms and flashy visuals, get this.  If you want the unmodified original trilogy, go sign one of the online petitions that are in circulation.   <br /> <br/>I give this one 2.5 stars.  Even though the unmodified originals aren't included (and they should have been for prosterity's sake) and the special features are lacking (they could relase a DVD set of JUST special features) it is still Star Wars with an ultra-clear pictures and excellent sound and it kicks *** even with all of the CGI added....it just doesn't kick it as hard.
B00FB13Y74|5|if you like angry birds and racing and fun you will love this game. My little cousin loves this game to, so does my sister. It is a good game.
0385743564|5|Brandon Sanderson can't seem to write a bad book, my only disappointment (sort of) is there is another book in the series and I have to wait unitl nect year for it to come out.
B00FRQ32N4|5|Good fun game easy to get cash and upgrade robot I suggest it I mean it's free so  why not try it
B0085A9J18|5|A high energy rollercoaster ride with incredible martial arts and endless action.  Thumbs way up to the movie and seller
B005HSL626|4|Keeps you busy and it's cool but I like the original much better. Hope they come up with something better soon. This does get old and boring. If you have nothing better to do this is an app I would recommend in the meantime. Nothing to brag about.
B00E8S2JZ4|4|Action packed!
B000KIRT6A|4|Great EQ. Disappointed that it has plastic case instead of metal. Makes it lite duty. Electrically works better than others I have used.
B00FATEJYE|5|Fun for all<br />Kids love it and very simular to the console edition . Recommended to all DC fans<br />And coming. Fans
B00I8H6MGS|4|Well written and directed.  Great performances by McConaughey, Garner, and Leto.  McConaughey shows great growth as an actor.  Highly recommend.
B008JFUNKU|5|The acting of Tom Hanks as usual excellent, but the last 10 min. of Hanks was the best real acting I ever saw. I don't know way he doesn't received the Oscar, simple excellent.<br />A very good drama movie that keep you on the front part of the seat all the movie. Highly recommended.
B005P89F1C|1|usher come and get your boyfriend anyway I think every album put out by justin bieber sucks besides I don't do christmas anyway sorry santa sorry I mean satan.

B000QRIGLC|5|This a very descriptive account of Operation Redwing and all that Marcus Luttrell went through.  As you read you feel the pain and anguish that Marcus went through.  The first part of the story is a great background description leading up to Redwing, especially Hell Week!  The second half of the book, describing the actual operation is as emotional as any book I have EVER read! Hooyah, Marcus, the Navy SEALS and all of our armed forces!!
B009K916ZK|5|I am very satisfied with the product, is what I needed and performance is good. recommended its acquisition. is ok
0486282112|5|The plot and perhaps the character itself of Frankenstein has been manipulated and perhaps even corrupted by the passage of time. Few of those that dress as \\"Frankenstein\\" for Halloween know the true story behind the creature.  This is unfortunate as Mary Shelley's classic is among the best books ever written.  More than a monster story, it raises questions of morality and ethics.<br /><br />When Dr. Frankenstein sets to create the creature, it is to set his stamp on science.  But in many respects, he took on the role of a deity by creating a new life.  But that new life is neglected and shunned by his creator, causing him to reject his deity.  As this morality play progresses, the frightening reign of terror begins.  Dr. Frankenstein is faced with a moral dilemma that could halt the creature.  He must weigh the risks of this dilemma against the benefits.  Though quite predictable in terms of the plotting, Frankenstein set a standard in its time.  The creature is cunning in the traps and scenarios it lays for his creator making the villain more frightening.<br /><br />Shelly's writing also causes the reader to feel sympathy for the creature.  It is a struggle to maintain this feeling, but Shelley is able to meet this challenge.  In this respect the daemon is less demonized.
B00T3DNKIE|1|Very disappointed with the storyline.
B009YP9L7U|2|Thankfully, I didn't buy this book as I would have been returning it! I like a good romance - 'good' being the operative word. This book is extremely predictable and following the old worn pattern of boy meets girl (in this case, boy marries girl <girl doesn't even remember...>), boy loses girl, boy gets girl back. I'd feel bad about revealing the plot line there but, let's face it, it's been done.<br /><br />The one thing this book did for me was convince me that I can write a better tale. I'd at least throw in some sort of interesting twist. If you like romance, try The Thornbirds. Excellently written and a story line that rivals none other.
B00A8ECU24|5|I love it. you can do some may things if I were you I would buy it have. P.S.my name is gamer girl
B000L212HC|4|I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then a few weeks ago on Blu-Ray (which looks super) - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.    It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.    Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.    This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love this game and have been playing on my phone. so happy I can now use my kindle fire. love it.
0439023491|4|I would recommend yes. It's exciting and never boring. A lot of action and catches your interest and attention along the story.
0061002747|5|Of all the agatha christie books that i have read( all three of them...) i have to say, that murder on the orient express had that most outstanding, unsuspectable ending, in any book i have ever read.  I just gave this book to my dad to read, once i was done, i am sure he likes it just as much as i did.  There are many twist and turns to this book which makes chritie the best of them all.

B000E1155E|4|The Arctic Monkeys have rocketed to the top of the UK music scene on the basis on a couple of great singles, and when their debut album was released a few weeks ago, it broke the record of the one-week sales. NME declared \\"Artic Monkeys have delivered a Definitely Maybe\\" (referring to Oasis' debut album). Not so fast...<br /><br />\\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\\" (13 tracks, 41 min.) brings basically a great bar band delivering mostly up-tempo songs about the life of 19 and 20 yr. olds (which is what the band members are). Track 2 \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" is the break-out single and an irresitable 3 min. blast of great music. While the first half of the album staggers a bit, the second half truly takes off with the pensive \\"Riot Van\\", followed by the best track of all, \\"Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured\\", a slightly reggae-flavored track that delights and delivers. Other stand-outs follow: \\"Mardy Hum\\" is a mellow singalong, and \\"Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong But...\\" is the meatiest track of all. \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" is the other attention-grabbing single, quite good.<br /><br />In all, this is quite a good album. But to say that this equals the towering \\"Definitely Maybe\\" does disservice to Arctic Monkeys. Let these guys (kids, really) develop and let's see where they go from here.
B00005B36H|5|there are many different ways to know a band. I have many times read things about Tool, but I really decided to give them a listen when I knew they were to collaborate with Skinny Puppy in the latter's forthcoming album. Then I discovered that Tool's drummer also played for NIN.<br />Most of the music I listen to and love is electronic. Tool isn't. But that isn't a drawback for me, I'm not prejudiced against guitar-based music, that eternal electronics vs guitars debate is or should be completely obsolete. But I do admit (that's just my opinion, my feelings, do no hate me for that) that most of guitar-based bands bore me. But Tool doesn't. Lateralus is a very good album, it's the only Tool album I've heard so I can't compare. I just call this good music. why?<br />First of all, the music is subtle. You may call it a metal band if u like; or you may say it's too bland to be labelled as that. doesn't matter to me. They're very good cos they're able to combine hardness and calmness in a extraordinarily subtle way. The songs in lateralus are quite long. And they lead us though many different passages: sometimes it's one full of hard guitar riffs, powerful basses and frenetic drums (tool's drummer deserves a special attention); then suddenly you're engulfed in a more atmospheric passage, with an acoustic guitar and some electronic touches, very few but subtle again, and the singer also accompanies these diferent moods: when he screams, he screams! but unlike many other singers, he's also able to sing melodically and even reminds me sometimes of Pink Floyd's Gillmour's way of singing. The drummer, as I've said, is really superb. I hadn't listened anything so good since Can's drummer. I especially love the way he plays the toms in various songs.<br />don't know if it's the best of the band. Just know it's a very very good album actually.
B00004ZAV3|5|Can't really believe someone can be as ignorant as the guy who  thinks the Beatles are 'ripping off' groups like Oasis, who've actually grown up listening to the Beatles!<br />Anyway, if you're<br />(a)New to the Beatles - Buy this.What better introduction to a       group than 27 of their most popular songs ? Granted, they         arguably have better songs, but then that's because they          have too many great songs to fit in one album,that too one        compiled based on popularity over a very short span of            time. Most of this stuff is evergreen - moreover, the point        is this - if you    don't like this, you can safely ignore        the Beatles from here on !<br />(b)Someone who likes the Beatles, but doesn't LOVE them - Buy this.Chances are most of the stuff you liked is here, since it's likely to be among the more popular ones, perhaps played by your Beatles crazy friends!<br />(c)A Beatles fan - You've already bought this, right ? If not, do so now!Sure, you might have all the songs in here, but not together - what's more the sequence of songs is also great .. starting with the chart-busting,foot-tapping stuff from their ealry days like 'Love me do' to the more mature,experimental sounds of their later work (e.g 'The long & winding road'), reflecting their growth as a band.<br />(d)Someone who HATES the beatles - Wow, you mean you people actually exist  ? Great - so why are you wasting you're time on this review ? Go play your favourtie brand of noise !<br />Just in case you couldn't tell, i belong to (c) above. Have a nice day

B00846REIS|1|Ugh I hate this book. I literally only finished it in HOPES it would get better at the end to continue. Same thing over and over and over.
1451629184|5|I cannot imagine how Jaycee managed to not only survive the horrific nightmare she endured for 18 years but to come out on the other side of her captivity and torture with her beautiful spirit within still intact. What this child endured as she grew into womanhood is something no one should have to go through. Jaycee Dugard deserves a special place in heaven because she has already lived in hell most of her life.<br /><br />It was very painful reading this book. I knew that it would be when I bought it. I bought it to show my support for Jaycee and the hell she has been through for the 18 years that ba$tard stole from her life. I am glad I read it though. If Jaycee had the courage to live it and then to write honestly about what happened to her, then the least I could do was to have the courage to read her story.
B004SIP9B0|4|I liked it very much.  I thought it would be boring because I lived through that time and thought I knew everything that went on but the acting was good and there was a lot of stuff I didn't remember or didn't know.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know what went on behind closed doors when Diana died.  Very enlightening.
B003L77GRO|4|Season 5 picks up right where season 4 left off. I love the fact that we get a new side to Dexter. It would seem that he does have some sort of feelings and is growing and changing, while learning to deal with different and new aspects of his life. I love it and would recommend it to anyone.
B006MW3V6U|5|I'm collecting all the seasons of this wonderful show.  Everyone I know loves this story and all the characters involved.  The acting is impeccable, the plot is full of adventure and drama, and the costumes and scenery are always perfection.  Can't wait for Season 3.
B005EHILV4|4|It works fine for being so extremely cheap but i would invest a bit more if you want to have a better sound quality but if you have good software already this is fine.
B008AX1HD8|5|Having read all the other Harry Hole novels that are available in English it was nice to see how it all started.  Lots of action and entertainment from start to finish.  What was quite nice about this book is that it was written in a slightly lighter tone, while still being a serious crime thriller.<br /><br />Looking forward to The Cockroaches!
B0088T3B0G|5|Legend and who done it mystery classic.  A must see in the genre that is timeless.  I still recommend this move decades later.
B00316DDUE|5|thanks.
0440180295|5|A classic. Vonnegut writes so outside the box. Great read.
B005LAIIPS|5|Very good sequel of the Bourne movie series.
B00BUCXVPI|5|loved it
B00FRQ32N4|1|Wouldnt play. Deleted
B0031RAOVY|5|This was so good that I bought another one and sent it to our daughter.
B005IQZB14|2|Seeing the advertisement for the movie made me believe this would be a deeper story than it was.  Half way through I didn't want to finish the book but I perservered and finished it.  Kind of boring to end.  Interesting parts describing the trail and the scenic views.
B0016YBFZ8|5|One of the greatest movies from the 90's. I would highly recommend this film to any one who was a fan of the God Father or The Untouchables.
B00CDGUOJQ|5|I've only made two of the recipes in this book so far, but I was told by non-vegan's that they were better than &#34;non&#34; vegan cupcakes. So, this cookbook gets a BIG thumbs up from me!!
B00DMCV7K0|5|I found this book to have unexpected depth when it came to the broader issue of slavery. The tale she weaves, based on historical figures, begins with a hint that there are many ways to be a slave and to be free. Over the course of the book she continues to layer this theme. the main characters, one slave, one her &#34;owner&#34; as a child, each evolve to understand the deeper meaning of true freedom - knowing who you are and being true to yourself. There were so many lovely symbols of hope, of rebellion, and of the power of partnerships. Many other thought provoking issues are raised - can a slave and her once owner love each other?  Is that possible when they are not equals?  How far can best intentions go?  Do they have any meaning if not combined with action?  And, of course, the age old problem for women: how can men espousing freedom be so blind to the enslavement of women?  Parts of Sarah's religious wanderings felt a bit long winded, but they were an essential part of her growth and discovery, so I was not horribly bothered by it.  Big thumbs up - will be my choice for Book Club.
B004ZRV3AU|3|Hard to use and is not what it says it is. Sorry I bought it!!
B000BW7QWW|5|It is seriously a kick ass movie!
B00005JKDR|4|I was very pleased with the delivery time. The dvd case was in great condition. Unfortunately there is one little skip in the beginning of the movie. Other than that it plays great. It plays well enough that I am not returning it.

B00NEJ7MMI|5|Beautiful harmonies and great album.
006056251X|5|Something that I haven't found in a book in quite a while--a pleasing pace. The story moved along beautifully without getting bogged down by the heroine going through chapter after chapter of self perusal (which I really hate). It was a fast, light read that was entertaining and pleasant.    I had not read any of the other books from 'The Wallflowers' series so I had no preset expectations about the main characters. I found them realistic and delightful. The story did start to fizzle out toward the end and could have been wrapped up a little sooner, but it's definitely worth a reread on down the road.
0385534639|2|While The Night Circus is highly imaginative and interesting at times, my overall impression of the book was unfavorable.  The dialogue was unnatural to the point that it was sometimes painful to read.  Other than that, the writing was pretty good.  However, the story in general was subpar at best.  So, all things considered, I wish that I hadn't invested my time in reading this story.
B005ZOBNOI|5|John green did an amazing job giving others an insight on the painful but lovely lives of families with (a) &#34;sick kid(s)&#34;  I really enjoyed this book. It really helped me face the reality of death and its inevitable appearance.
B00000K3CK|5|Great movie, fast shipping from Amazon, we are very pleased with our purchase.  This movie is a classic. If you haven't seen it, buy it. If you have, buy it.  This is one of those \\"Watch every season\\" kinda movies.   You'll like it. I promise!
0525953094|5|No surprises that Follett put out another great book. Learned a lot and I love it.

B004L9MFM2|5|I've enjoyed this whole series and this book was no exception.  I'm in love with all the characters and just can't wait to read about them.

B004DI7HZ6|5|I loved it! I do not read much, but this really kept my attention and story is really interesting. I would recommend this to anyone.
B006CHML4I|5|Good size. My friends lived the NATO straps and dosent cause that much of a fuss. You won't get too many compliments unless someone looks at it closely and they say 'dude that's a very cool watch'
B007RKPO84|5|In general I am mixed on European metal and don't really follow Kreator, I had the Coma of Souls album and loved it but found their earlier work seemed more generic.  When I heard the title track on Liquid Metal, I ordered the CD and have been listening to it for a few weeks now.  It has everything I like about the coma of souls album with a current upgrade of speed (guitar and drumming) and production.  I love the vocal style and production.  The only part that could be better is they clearly have adopted an &#34;In Flames&#34; influence with takes some track too far into the anthum / power metal genre.
B0044C5SCU|4|Love the series,  while not its strongest year,  it advanced the story well, and as always the acting especially Anna Torv's was excellent.
B002M5E2DW|1|Very repetitive. The basic message could've been written in a paragraph. I found it difficult to believe: hasn't everyone experienced the feeling of expecting something and then the disappointment of not receiving it? Research does back the notion of a self fulfilling prophecy. I suspect there's nothing more to The Secret than this.
B000002MUQ|2|Sammy said these recently about &#34;don't tell me&#34; : “The record was big. We always sold 4 or 5 million records no matter what we did. But that song didn’t take us anywhere, and I know why now. It wasn’t what Van Halen fans wanted. It showed the darkness of Van Halen, and basically the end of the band.” Well, rock'n'roll's fun and entertaining mission that began in 1954 by Bill Haley's signature song was killed by the entry of Seattle's whiny sound in 1992. Same can be said for Van Halen who failed to deliver an uncompromised follow up to For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. Fans were let down. While Eddie argued in press that they weren't forced by grunge to change in 1995, he admitted that &#34;all the songs were in D minor, the saddest key.&#34; He knew what he was doing. Van Halen camp watched as all established rock acts succumbed to the grunge sound, crashed and burned between 92 and 94. They saw the earth beneath their feet shudder. The whole musical scene had changed by 1995. MTV was making fun of Van Halen by showing a segment of Poundcake as &#34;dangerously electric&#34; to advertise its Unplugged series. Rednecks like Mike Judge was making fun of the Jump video in his Beavis and Butthead cartoon. Eddie must've been truly scared. He can't go 100-percent grunge and risk complete alienation by his fan base, but he is also afraid to go out there as the fun-loving Van Halen. So, he hires hitmaker and trend-follower Bruce Fairbairn (who remnodeled Bon Jovi after Van Halen!!!), and together they &#34;gloomify&#34; and &#34;grungify&#34; Van Halen with grungy songs mixed (&#34;balanced&#34;) with a limited dose of vintage Van Halen riffs. This is what they thought was culturally acceptable in 1995. During a Rolling Stone interview Eddie repackages himself as the survivor of abuse (of alcohol in his case) justifying Van Halen's musical mood-swing. Cuts his hair, puts siamese twins on the cover, and a single that looks like a Nirvana video. The word &#34;victim&#34; appears maybe 20 times. &#34;Don't Tell Me&#34;, the ode to Curt Cobain, was the first signal to many fans to part with the Van Halen clan. Hence, Balance slipped through the charts, followed by the weakest tour in the band's career. People started pointing fingers and Sammy Hagar took the fall. Back to the album : The second most unforgivable mess of a song imho is the Poundcake makeover Seventh Seal. It is like turning a fine cut of meat into spam. You've got the gloomy &#34;Not Enough,&#34; and the stone temple pilots-like &#34;Aftershock.&#34; Sammy's voice is a barely audible, coarse mess on most of these tracks. The melodic Can't Stop Loving You, in the style of the &#34;unplugged&#34; movement of the 1990s, is almost a cynical rip-off of &#34;Every Breath You Take,&#34; as covered by hootie and the blowfish. Then we have the two 70s rockers Take Me Back and Feeling (emulating Aerosmith that was also popular at the time), and really stellar by Aerosmith standards, but not so much by Van Halen standards. Back to &#34;Not Enough&#34;: this is John Lennon's Imagine with new lyric's on it and a Joe Perry's Dream On solo played over it. Now, its different when you throw in a Led Zep riff (5150) but when you construct a whole song from classic rock radio, that is con artistry. &#34;Not Enough&#34; must have been Glen Ballard's work.  The Good : One star for the instrumental &#34;Baluchitherium,&#34; whose main riff is a note for note reprisal of Trevor Rabin's Eyes of Love; and another star for moments of Amsterdam—two songs that prove that Eddie and Al are still a creative force. Sadly, from this point on, only bits and pieces of greatness would flow from the once leading fountain of rock'n'roll. Don't get me wrong, by grunge standards, Balance is a masterpiece! just like Def Leppard's Slang is--music performed musicians who'd honed their chops. Yet, these albums sealed the fates of both bands. The grunge thing truly hurt musicians, including David LeeRoth (remember &#34;she's my machine,&#34;? when a humorless David Lee Roth had sabotaged his career almost overnight).  Look at how many failed comebacks  and rehabs Eddie had to go through in the last 20 years. For many fans, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge is the last great Van Halen album: it had wit, humor, delivered by the meanest rock'n'roll machine that was known to mankind on top form.

B003EYVXXW|5|This was a brilliant film! I have an interest in religious history, and this film did a great job of capturing the conflicts between early Christians with Jews and Pagans. You also learn about the thought processes behind many scientific discoveries, which I really appreciated. The cast was wonderful, the sets were spectacular, and the story was awesome!     There's not much to say other than see the film for yourself. You will not be disappointed.
1741791529|5|great book
0316069906|5|I appreciate the honest look at the meat production industry presented in this book. Most of all I like the style with which Foer communicates his findings.  The author reveals a lot of personal information but he also asks the readers to live by their own standards, not his.  All that makes it for an easy and even enjoyable reading of a lifestyle book which nonetheless reads like a novel.        Eating Animals is a very inspiring and informative book.  I wholeheartedly encourage everybody to consider reading it.  Even -- or maybe, especially if -- you are not a vegetarian. It definitely changed the way I view the world.  It might do the same to you.  And if not, you will at least enjoy reading a book that not only educates but also entertains.  And one more thing that I can promise each and every reader -- THIS BOOK WILL REALLY MAKE YOU THINK AND FORCE YOU TO MAKE PROFOUND CHOICES WHICH WILL AFFECT THE WAY YOU LIVE THE REMAINING PART OF YOUR LIFE.      I noticed that some reviewers mention \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" as a companion to this book.  In my opinion it would be reading the same just by another author.  To get a broader view at nutrition and how it affects our health, our longevity, and the world around us I suggest reading \\"Can we Lve 150 Years\\" instead.
B00T74HTY0|5|I loved Grace's first book and her second one doesn't disappoint either. This book delves even deeper into what it's like to live in Tokyo/Japan (especially as a foreigner), and as someone who also lives in Tokyo, I can say that her observations are really spot on. I love the way Grace describes things I already know about in fun and interesting ways, as well as introducing me to new things and different perspectives. It's so special to be able to see the same situation from both Grace and Ryosuke's point of view.<br /><br />If you're interested in Japanese culture, visiting/living in Japan or just getting an insight into the lives of a wonderful couple navigating a cross-cultural relationship in another country, be sure to pick up this book. Warning: You'll probably get addicted to Grace's blog for life. Haha
B000G8NXYG|5|You know the story, you know the director the actors. This DVD has great contentary and interviews, would reccommend for the serious collector or getting a better understanding of Japanese cinema and culture back in the day and the way it has influesed western film making and also the other way around. Not to mention great story telling.

The long awaited follow-up to Toxicity is almost over.  And now for the review, this cd is ok it could've been better I ecpecially like the first half of the cd and the rest is just ok.  I don't own this album (thats right I stole it) and I'm glad I did because I normally listen to there self-titled cd than any of there albums.

B0046B3QTG|2|One or two funny things throughout this dull movie.  Minions only thing worth watching...like old looney toons.  Maybe the second movie will be better.
B00992CF6W|5|I have a lot of games but I play minecraft more than anything
0385523394|5|I loved the book. The book is totally different from the TV series but have a few similarity. I love the TV show as well. Piper you did that honey❤❤❤
B002VRZEYM|5|This movie was very informative and eye opening. I learned so much from watching this movie and now I'm on a quest to pay more attention to my food and such. Who knew that we as consumers were being lied to so much! Watch this movie! It is worth every penny because you just might end up saving your own life and even the life of others.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I started the game three days ago so far so good. I just wish you could have more energy than fifty so I could play for a longer time.
B001974DG0|5|This one is a classic. Reminds me of the good old days reading early Stephen King novels. It's a story of friendship and love and monsters and bad guys all wrapped up with a Frankensteinesque bow.
B00563M11M|5|My first Terry Pratchett book and it won't be my last. Wonderful 'Hero story' but so so much more too.
B001EBV0OY|4|A wonderful ode to life and freedom. Brillantly interpreted, surprising in the end when you don't necessarily expect it, this movie is a real study of characters and a deep jump into carceral life that only the series Oz could highlight better.
B006RUJST6|5|I loved this book. The author did an amazing job of bringing the characters to life and the story was filled with raw emotion. As I read I felt like I was being pulled into the world of Will and Lake, it was a great escape - well worth a look :)
B00000IL1K|5|I have recently became a huge fan of Sarah Brightman through &quot;La Luna&quot;. When I had the opportunity to buy this cd, I made no hesitation and quickly snatched up &quot;Eden&quot; to add to my cd collection. This woman is absolutely amazing.<br />As much as I dislike &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, I love the Italian version of this song as well as Sarah's cover of &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;. The songs are simply stunning. Her covers are a bit hokey at best and I will admit to laughing to them when I first heard her covers but nevertheless I love the songs (covers and originals).<br />I like how Sarah Brightman melds opera, pop and hints of electronica in her music and that is what makes her different among other female artists. She is a departure from the artists I listen to like PJ Harvey and Poe. I love her sense of overdramatic she brings to her songs although some people don't appreciate it but I can. Sarah Brightman is a true original for me.
B00BHHIWQO|5|I love playing the game! It gives you something fun to do! It's also fun when your friends are playing too!
B005CRQ3H0|4|Good cast. A bit long but good. Phoenix is great as always!
B000EJ9MTW|5|Finally, the new Black Sabbath album we've been waiting for!!!!!!!!
B008CP6RWU|5|Sublime.  first video game that had me misting up at the end.  Not like anything else out there. :)
630512762X|5|Face Off is a great movie. Its about a man who's trying to take down a terrorits group so he takes the face of one of the terrorits captured (Cage). But Cage's character somehow gets the face of the man who took his (Travolta), and nothing is the same from there. The good guy is in a prisoner and the bad guy is among the good people, living with the guys face he has family, ect. The ending action scence is terrific and the movie is awesome.
B00AREIAI8|5|Awesome game really fun to play. Easy to learn very for everyone to play. Fun for anyone. Especially if you like horses.
0763624292|2|This CD is rather a disappointment.  It starts off quietly with somewhat hushed voices that I hardly knew it had begun.  I have gotten used to the vibrant and joyous toddler cds that this was a surprise and very disappointing considering how exciting the story can be.  I like to read Going on a Bear Hunt in a happy exicted voice with little toddlers following along.  This is not that story with any of the same excited enthusiasm.  I'm sorry i bought this one without hearing any of the tracks first.
B00KWVZ750|4|Definitely different than previous Angry Bird games.
B00GIZO674|5|I am really enjoying this game! It is so addicting. I am having trouble putting it down. I love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5|Love this game!!! So happy to have it on my kindle fire HD!!!!! I am on level 440 waiting on update!!!! hopefully it will be soon????
B000055Y0Y|5|First off, we never do learn the President's name, except for his Secret Service codename \\"Traveler\\".  I guess that jives with the philosphy expressed by Clint Eastwood's character of never getting to know who you're protecting as you might not want to take a bullet for them then.  So I can live with not knowing.  Otherwise, this is an excellent film...the real-life Secret Service certainly thought so.  Clint Eastwood plays the agency's only remaining active agent who was on duty during the Kennedy assasination back in 1963, 30 years before this film.  Now, he's pulled out of his life working undercover to bust counterfeiters to investigate a threat on the current President.  This threat comes in the form of John Malkovich, who begins a series of mindgames with Eastwood and the Secret Service that begin with him calling himself \\"Booth\\" in a nod to the Lincoln assasination...he also knows plenty about Kennedy's death, so it's imediatly obvious that the man has a strange hobby.  Malkovich has played his fair share of villains, but many of them could take lessons from the character in this film.  Too many times we see a person so evil that they become  something like Dr. Hannibal Lector.  But John Malkovich does not slide down that slippery slope and remains his own man  with his own agenda and headgames.  It is a performance that Mr. Malkovich should definetly always keep on his resume.  Clint Eastwood is no slouch on his end.  John Malkovich is looking for an equal in his \\"game\\" and Eastwood provides it.  Now aged a bit since 1963 (hey, they put the actor's real age to good use) he steps up to the plate and keeps up step for step while remaining perfectly frustrated that he can't get ahead of this maniac.  The diolog between these two men is one of the best parts of this exciting film.  Dylan McDermott works alongside Eastwood as his young, somewhat uncertain partner and Rene Russo plays the young man's counterpart on the President's protection detail.  Thankfully the film only spent little time on any sort of romantic elements between Eastwood and Russo...it's the one part I could have done completely without.  While we see little of the President (the film isn't about him, remember) we do see a fair bit of Fred Dalton Thompson (is he in the Senate while they made this movie?) as the President's high-strung Chief of Staff.  I always enjoy seeing Thompson around and this film is no different...I would have liked to have seen more of him.  This is an awsome film and worth keeping around to watch again and again...and again.
B00BEIYH6U|5|Well this is nearly as good as the first which is usual for all the shows that keep going in formation etc. 1 2 3. Now the comedy is still there and the storyline is fantastic with some bits and pieces that will have you laughing. Don't  you move or you'll  miss something and will regret it later.  Now the story is that they are teenagers trying to be normal and fitting in with all other students to  is near impossible and a new crisis has come up. Red Mist has decided that it is time to take revenge for his fathers death, so with ideas on how to form a league of super hero's, and tackle his problem at all the same time, now we all know anything can happen. Need I say more, the lyrics come thick and fast as the action follows just as quick, so with all this going on I rated this an A grade plus for fabulous entertainment that will have you glued to the seat, so now go on and collect the movie and on the way don't forget the popcorn, that is needed to make this a night of sheer delight with all the family and will be remembered as a great comedy that is different and a pleasure to watch after a hard day at work. So now relax put your feet up and rest a little, Let the show begin.  Enjoy!
B00I6JOBTI|5|Great movie and it arrived on the day the DVD was released in stores.
B004GJDQT8|3|It never appeared in my browser. Tried to add it on & it tells me I already have it. Just gave up.
1611761565|4|It was a fascinating and seemingly accurate description of an important event . Seems the only thing accomplished by pres Obama.
1452650888|5|To say this work is \\"mind-boggling\\", falls far too short of the visceral impact it has had on myself, and all those I have urged to read it. I do believe that Life Between Lives Hypno-Regressive Therapy has established a new and unique paradigm for Therapeutic Counseling and Hypnotherapy. Over and above the traditional psycho-therapeutic approach acknowledging Childhood as a primary formative influence in shaping our adult personalities, Journey of Souls reveals the poignant contribution of karmic debt in each of our lives. Whether karma is deemed as good or bad is merely a function of situational contingencies, and subjective semantics; standards applied to one life event may be totally inappropriate in another. While our Childhoods provide ample ground for determining fairly accurate psychological diagnoses, past life regressions and LBL hypnotherapy throw numerous wrenches into the spokes of our psycho-diagnostic wheel. How can a therapist hope to determine why particular phobias surface, when the contributing factors (karma) may be rooted in past lives numbering at times in the hundreds?<br /><br />I have no solution to this psychological dilemma, and I'm fairly certain a single approach to this problem is non-existent. For anyone who is serious about their origins or discovering their life's purpose, this book is a \\"must read\\". I salute Dr. Newton and his open-mindedness in presenting such a controversial and previously unexplored aspect of metaphysical research.
B00BXI26XC|5|The best app for plane watching, with detailed up to the minute info on any flight.
B005K17RU0|5|Very good app. I tried the weather bug which I love on my droid but the kindle didn't like it. This app is perfect
B00E8KLWB4|5|I have been playing this game a long time and I still enjoy it.  The only concern I have (and it's minor) is that I would like to be able to zoom in closer as some objects were too small to identify.  Otherwise, what a great game.
B00701L5XS|1|Tried to install, then it said it had to have wifi and wouldn't let me cancel the download. should have said this before I tried to install.
076790592X|5|a very humanitarian approach
B00BB8RKH6|2|The movie was to slow didnt have much plot.  showed the hole he was wallowing but very little how he got there. He was not likeable in the beginning. Should have shown the high to the low then his freedom. His likeability at the end was not very believeable.
1465408681|3|Great price and book in good condition.  However my son was a little disappointed that the figure was missing.
B0007TKNII|4|Awesome
B00JJH3FDE|1|Couldn't hold our attention long enough to even make us want to sit through the whole thing! Waste of money
B0001FUHV6|3|The CD The Piano has skipped since the first time I played it. I have played it in 2 different CD players and it skips on both
B00DR0PDNE|5|Can't go wrong with this in my opinion - I love android and google .....If you're going to buy a new tv/smart dvd player you may not find any use for this but if you have an older tv without smart functionality what are you waiting for buy it!<br /><br />New tv - Hundreds of dollars<br />Apple - way too much in my opinion.<br />Smart dvd player - $69<br />Chromecast - $35<br /><br />I think the price and functionality speaks for itself.
B00FVVR2ZO|3|I've been really enjoying this game.  The quick energy depletion doesn't really bug me, because I play a lot of games, and I just cycle through them.
B003JTHXOK|5|I haven't read a book yet that I didn't like from Nicholas Sparks and this book was no exception.  I loved it and couldn't put it down.  I think I read it in record time.  What's not to like.  It is just a good book.  Yes I would recommend it to friends and already have.  Not sure I should have read it before going to the movie.  Both movie and book are good, just different.  Go to the movie and YES still read the book.
044024367X|1|There is a bookshelf in my office where people leave books they've already read and don't want to keep so that others may enjoy them. Well let me tell you, I KNOW why the former owner of this book didn't feel inclined to keep it! As a matter of fact I almost felt bad putting it back on the shelf without some type of note (i.e.: DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GARBAGE!!). I kept putting the book down and not really caring to pick back up. This morning I got to work and had 5 pages left, instead of standing outside and finishing up I chose to go inside it's that bad. The plot is very repetative and unbelievable, I don't care what kind of super human this Reacher guy is, no way is he walking away from these situations time and time again. Plus the lady cop whose just willing to lend out her car to some homeless dude? Riiiiiiight. And when she's not lending him her car she's breaking and entering WITH him? She's supposed to be a cop instead Childs is having her commit all types of crimes and then hooking up with a homeless guy who's been wearing the same clothes AND underwear for days. Ick. I've never read any of the other Reacher novels and after this mess I doubt I ever will. Shame since some of the other books have mych better reviews. Anyway if you're a Reacher fan, just skip this one and pretend it never happened, if your looking to read your first Reacher novel I can confidentlly say pick another one to start with. Even though I've never read the others I'm hard pressed to believe his publisher would let him get away with TWO novels this bad!!
B007REV4YI|5|First I love this movie and I know the person getting it will also love it.  So I hope this helps
B00005JO1P|5|We went after Thanksgiving dinner with a group fo five ranging in age for 60 to 27.  All of us loved it.  I had a hard time buying Joaquin Phoenix as Cash at first.  But as the movie rolled I saw think he captured Cash very well.  And Reese Witherspoon astonished,us all with a superb performance.  We loved the sanpshots of Elvis and others including Jerry Lee Lewis.  See it!
B00D6SBOWG|5|Awesome game wish it was all free do you think about it at everything about the most important that the most beach google maps and the biggest problem with the extra time
B00B935SUY|3|I enjoyed this movie mostly.  The first hour is actually about Sound City - its history, its people, all who have passed through there, and the hit records that originated there.  The story of Sound City itself is fascinating and insightful.  The last half-hour or so, while sort of intriguing, is really just about Dave Grohl and his cronies recording on the old Sound City board.  This is interesting for what its worth (&#34;Hey - there's Paul McCartney!  What's he doing there??&#34;) but it starts to look like more of an ego-trip at a certain point.
0345363132|5|I loved this book. I also think Penman's focus on minor characters such as  Veronique and Francis, Hugh and Caitlin (from the Reckoning)and Ranulf and  Rhiannon humanise her writing. These characters are not great kings or  warriors but just observers and as we see history unfold through their eyes  it becomes more real to us.
B000000W5L|5|Inspector: This Stones album is a classic. Deux Deux: Janet Jackson's career went to Hell after her Super Bowl appearance but The Rolling Stones can still rock. Inspector: Cranky Reviewer is wrong as usual. Deux Deux: Exile on Main Street was recorded here in France and has classics like Tumbling Dice, Happy, Rocks Off, Rip This Joint and many many more. Inspector: I say buy now or you will be put under arrest!
B00CHVJI08|5|what a funny movie. I had to get this product. I usually put it for my little cousins. for entertainment
B000002A46|5|Satisfied
B000055Y0X|5|First, it's Kubrick and it's a dark comedy.  <BR>Secondly, it is black and white.<BR>C, if you know nothing about the cold war, it may be a complete waste of your time.<BR>If you do not like any of the above points, then forget about this movie.<br />If you are still reading, then you either know as I do that this is one of the funniest film ever made, or you need to purchase it immediately to remind yourself of this fact.  <br />Outside of having a terrific sense of timing for drama, comedy, horror, dialogue, cinematography, Kubrick was able to create a dark comedy about a real US mentality that significantly defined the second half of the 20th century.  <br />If you are under 30 and have not been exposed to the issues based aroung the cold war, this may seem an absolute waste of time.<br />This is a must for any DVD library.  It can be watched over and over again.
141694737X|5|Excellent lift the flap book showing children all of the zoo animals that wouldn't make great pets for one reason or another. Board book with thicker flaps, so they do not rip easily.
B00AKKS278|3|Not the best written book, but the ideas are HUGE, and can't help but impact you in tremendous ways.<br /><br />Read this.<br />Do this.
B004MC8CA2|1|Thank you for helping promote and encourage further the scourge of hymanity known as Christianity. It&apos;s too bad this religion wasn&apos;t done away with before the digital age, now we&apos;ll never get rid of it.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This is a great game!!! Very addicting . The animals are adorable and the graphics are awesome!!! Loooooooove this game!!
B00D23GXB2|5|I got this book for my Kindle on a recommendation of the DJ Gatsby Book Club (DJGBC) on FB, and a book discussion that was coming up with the author.  I was very pleasantly surprised. This book will give you a new outlook on poetry.  The book is very sensual...romantic is not the right word for it.  It will show you that not all erotica is just raw sex.  The way The G.P.A. writes, it seems as though you get a good look into what he is like as a person.  When I was done with this book, it left me wanting to read more by The G.P.A.  I have a whole new view on poetry.  I look forward to reading more work by The G.P.A. and hope to see him read live one day.  Read on!
B00005JO20|2|Anyone that hasn't seen the original will love this movie with it's endless action and special effects. However, the true Kong fan will be very disappointed if he expects to see the original movie redone with state-of-the-art special effects. The movie is an hour too long, with everything over done. The acting is so-so. Naomi Watts is ok as Ann Darrow, but she surely isn't up to Fay Wray's performance in the original. Jack Black fails in his attempt to equal the role of Carl Denham, masterfully played by Robert Armstrong in the 1933 release. Credibility is lacking in many ways. The antique cars are painted bright colors, something that never happened in 1933. Dress and language are totally \\"today\\" with words like \\"stiffed\\", an expression invented in the 70's, sticking out like a sore thumb. I could go on and on, but you get the picture. This movie could be improved by editing out over an hour of superfluous material. Enjoy it as an action packed adventure, but don't expect to see an improved King Kong. It falls flat on it's face in it's attempt to do just that.
B007J4T2G8|3|I read this book because it was so popular, and talked about by almost everyone.  I thought it was okay, but not a quality piece of literature.
B007VUA7VO|5|Listen to me when i tell you that this app is HORRIBLE...FOR BEING SO GREAT!! This is the best battery app I have EVER seen in my time of searching for easeir ways to keep track of battery power and other things related to battery power<br /><br />This app not only tells you your battery power but it tells you so much more, like how long it takes to charge your kindle by plug-in adaptor or by USB adaptor, and many other things, it is very decent and worthy of being downloaded and kept for life.<br /><br />I'd give it 6stars if I could :D
B008IYR2BA|5|I am addicted to Dexter.  I watched for hours and couldn't stop.  The writers do the most creative job of creating complex characters and meshing unexpected, unpredictable plot lines.
B00C0ALZ0W|4|Very good advices for who wants to try to go remote (even just for some days a week). If you are already working remotely since some time you'll find a lot of things you already know. Anyway you could find some little things to improve your daily experience.
B004XDYJRU|5|I've used this for months and I LOVE it! it doesn't get much better than this! get it for free always in the market though....
B007IXWL2C|3|The storyline doesn't have a lot of content or depth to it.  It is a little farfetched and consists of sex, sex and more sex with the same partner.  Books two and three are considerably better than book 1.  I had to finish the trilogy once I started reading.
B00G32QIEG|1|Not at a what you expect it to be.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|Love it. Love it. Love it!
B0054JZC6E|5|Great. way to keep. your mind young. Enjoy the changeling different games all in one place. New to this type of playing.
0553418025|5|This book is fantastic! An excellent mix of Apollo 13 and Cast Away, the science is wonderfully believable. Can't wait for the movie!
B00785P2QC|4|I like it.
B008XBHIEY|5|The original is the best!!
B00E9PMML2|4|We didn't get to see all of these when they first came out and our grandchildren loved 4,5&6 so we got them.  My husband and I  enjoyed them, but our grandkids loved them.  They have watched them at least 6 times each.  If you enjoy Star Wars or Star Trek you will enjoy these.  They are well done and the special effects are spectacular.
B004GJDQT8|5|Amazon is very easy to use everything you want or need is there, and if it's not then what you're looking for doesn't exist.

B000031WD9|4|\\"American Pie\\" is no raunchier than the average run-of-the-mill teen flick, but what makes this a step above the rest is that this movie has a heart.  A group of high school seniors make a deal to lose their virginity before graduation, and they all run into all sorts of drama.  The cast is a charm.  Jason Biggs shines as the loveable dork Jim, who keeps getting into one humiliating episode after another.  His scene with Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) could go down as one of the most hilarious moments in film ever.  Seann William Scott is great as the playfully obnoxious Stifler; he's rude and charmless and yet you can't help but still like the dude.  Mena Suvari also stands out, as does Tara Reid (which is really saying something).  If \\"There's Something About Mary\\" was the must-see comedy of 1998, then \\"American Pie\\" was the must-see comedy of 1999.  It's not too late to pick up this DVD; for one, you'll finally get the chance to know what your friends mean when they recite the one-liner: \\"this one time, at band camp...\\"
B0000W3P00|3|I was hoping the sound quality would be better but it's simply a reissue, NOT a remaster.<br /><br />If you have the original, save your money.<br /><br />It does come with the lyrics though, which is something the original CD didn't have.
0345529057|4|I usually don't read books like this because I'm more attracted to motivational books. But I must say, I'm addicted to this series. Addicted! From the time I started the first book I can't put it down. I think they did a real good job with the HBO series as well. (My new favorite self help book is \\" Live Like A Fruit Fly \\" .. check it out)
B00HWWUQYY|4|it was good but not like the first one
B000B0WODA|4|Franz Ferdinand's sophomore album, \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\", is more proof that they are by far one of the best British rock groups. Yet, I still must admit that I really did like their first album, \\"Franz Ferdinand\\", a bit better. Nonetheless, Franz Ferdinand, led by lyric genius Alex Kapranos, still keeps their British charm and retro coolness to this must-have album. <br />I should probably start out with the things I questioned about this album. First of all, the song \\"You're the Reason I'm Leaving\\" is recorded right after \\"Evil and a Heathen\\" , and while both are great songs, their chorus melodies are extremely similar. Also, the song \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\" sounds so much like a Beatles song I questioned its originality - but it's still a nice song. <br />But there is much more to love about this album. \\"The Fallen\\" is a powerful political number, with a twangy guitar and rugged vocals. \\"Do You Want To\\" is an upbeat and fun pop-rock track that you wouldn't mind listening to over and over. But the track that stood out the most to me was \\"This Boy\\". With its muffled chorus and sour guitar, this is a good example of what these UK boys can concoct. <br />Overall, I can honestly say that Franz Ferdinand certainly didn't fall toward a sophomore slump, although it doesn't quite compare to the punch I got from the first album. But hey - it's good music. (:
B00BAXFECK|1|There were just a few moments when this book was engaging. Much effort is spent developing the characters of two shallow drug addicts. Difficult situations are resolved with unlikely and unbelievable, to me, scenarios. Overall, I have lost some faith in the Pulitzer committee.
0307592731|5|Captivating from beginning to end. Everyone deserves to take a solo journey and this book will encourage it! The author is honest and holds nothing back about her experience. This book is not a camper's manual but rather an inspiring book about life's ups and downs and conquering your goals.
B00BVYNSLC|5|This is a very creative show. The acting is amazing!
B005JE1KHE|5|This is really a dark book from the first book which I have read in farseer trilogy, but my personal opinion is that this book is even better than the first book also this has bang on action from the start to the finish of the book.<br /><br />We are again given the story from the view point of Fitz who is basically is a bastard of king in waiting chivalry, who as we know from the last book is dead due to fall from a horse.This book shows us Fitz maturing and showing his character as a whole of how he is a king's man from the start to the end of the book.The last book basically focused more on characters of Burrich and Chade, this book has focus on Verity,Fool and Fitz's love interest.Fitz conversations with Verity given us more on the character of King in waiting Verity, we come to know how much he cares about his people and to what extent he is ready to stretch himself so that his people do not come to harm.<br /><br />The another important character who is more of a mystery is the fool, who guides fitz whenever he needs it.The fool is quite a mysterious character in the whole book and although he confesses what are his aspirations but still there is an aura of mystery surrounding him.Fitz love life is basically a roller coaster rife for me because he tries to separate his other life of assassin from his normal life but finally it starts becoming too much conflicting for him and then finally he chooses.<br /><br />The other important part of the story are the red ship pirates who we are given some glimpses of but still their aspirations are not conveyed to us, also their attack is in full force throughout the book.There also characters such as Regal,Serene,will from the last books who will keep growing.<br />also there is lot of magic involved in book which we had glimpses in the last book and fitz finds some one to bond with his wit again.<br /><br />All in all the book is dark but Hobb does not lose the sight of the main story at any point in the time,I could not stop reading this book once started.
B006GLLXXK|5|Love the series. You guys need to put seasons 4-6, and that is it. So happy the new season is on, even though it's the last :(
0689878451|5|This book is a really sweet, simple story about a penguin with two daddies based on a true story from the Central Park Zoo.  As New Yorkers we thought this was an interesting local story to share with our kids.  Its up to a parent on when they feel like the content/message is appropriate for their children, but our toddlers really liked the story.

B00028HBKM|1|Love Mel Gibson.  But this movie was so dark I wanted to shake the screen.  I know it was a dark day but good godness help me, I disliked this movie.  I guess it's one of those movies, either you love it or hate it.  I'm in the later.  I keep thinking of something good to say about this, but I just cannot.  So if you are questioning if this movie is worth the time to see it, it probably is not.

B00EQ0CKRQ|5|This game is really fun. You can play on a career or on multiplayer. It has very good graphics,and it is also not as touchy as other games like this that I have played. It takes a while to download, but after that you'll be glad you waited. This game definitely deserves five stars. Good job, Gameloft. Oh, and did I forget to mention that it is free? Oh yeah, it is free.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Not one to mince words, but as it is dreadfully late, I will simply say this: I would wait a decade for another Outlander novel. Not sure I would enjoy the duration, but in the end, I would know the wait was not in vain!
B00HXYKYIE|5|Excellent novel combining fascinating storyline, elephants, paranormal and psychics into one of those books you can't put down.  Missed my bus stop more than once while commuting.
B000002JSN|4|For a band that defined rock and roll excess, it's striking that it took so long for Led Zeppelin to release a double album. Disc one is solid gold: six great tracks that show a nonpareil hard rock band moving from strength to strength, culminating in &#34;Kashmir,&#34; a soaring epic that pushes Robert Plant to some of the finest singing of his career. Disc two is more of a grab bag: a reflective classic (&#34;Ten Years Gone&#34;), a lovely instrumental (&#34;Bron-Yr-Aur&#34;), some studio goofs and a few outtakes that might have been better left to the bootleggers. It's listenable all the way through, but the first disc is the one you'll come back to.
0399255370|5|This book is absolutely delightful for children and parents.  The story is very creative and the illustrations are adorable.  I highly recommend this book!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Amazing cast and story that draws you in from the first episode. You will not want it to end. A wonderful must see from Amazon!
B003YL4LYI|5|Yes, I too wish the story had 200 more pages to move the story closer to its conclusion, though better yet why not the 2000 to 5000 more pages it will take to finish this. Even with book yet another stepping stong toward its conclusion, its a very impressive - masterpiece - of a book, in a series which is the best fantasy series ever. If GRRM croaks before his masterpiece is complete I will kill him myself! Wanting more is really what the impatient folks are complaining about, which is the best thing any author can hear. I loved this book. I love this series. Yes, I want more, though not to the point where I have to knock stars off the rating because it;s taking longer than I would like. This is a large book, though the times flies by reading it, and the end comes way too quick, despite it's mega length. It takes a great book to suspend time like that. Hence my 5 star rating. Greaqt job, GRRM, please keep on a rolling!

B00007KQA3|2|I should say first that this should be a good movie, at least on paper.  John Hurt and Richard Burton turn in solid performances, and everything about the production -- set design, costumes, etc. -- looks just as it should.  But there is something lacking in this adaptation that makes it pale compared to the book. <br /> <br />Orwell's _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ was, largely, _about_ reading and writing, and the power they give to people.  As such, it is a thrilling novel, and a great pleasure to read.  Seeing John Hurt writing in Winston Smith's diary doesn't quite cut it for me; the essential spirit is lost in the translation to film. <br /> <br />Beyond this, there are also some more mundane elements of the plot and characters that were cut to fit the screening time.  What I missed most was Smith's growing frustration with Julia being \\"only a revolutionary from the waist down\\" and his schoolboyish admiration (affection, really) for O'Brien. <br /> <br />The only real highlight of the movie is the constant voiceovers coming from the telescreens regarding the progress of the war and the rooting out of traitors.  Orwell's vision is captured perfectly here, and the woman who read the \\"news\\" voiceovers gets the tone exactly right. <br /> <br />All in all, the movie is nowhere nearly as compelling as the book, and isn't really worth the trouble.  In the time it takes you to procure and watch the movie, you could be halfway through the book.
B007J4T2G8|1|This is my very first review on Amazon although I have purchased many, many books.  I read constantly, at least a book a week.  Well, I must admit that I fell into the trap of this book.  I started seeing it everywhere, facebook friends, online reviews, an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer.  So I looked it up on Amazon.  Wow, over 2,000 reviews.  Must be good!  NYT bestseller list....that says something.  Amazon top 5....what am I missing?<br /><br />I read a couple of reviews on Amazon and poo pooed the negative ones.  After all, there are always some people who can't be pleased.  But this seemed like the new Hunger Games, the new Fire and Ice, the new Harry Potter.  OK...go for the trilogy, hit the quick buy kindle button and the three were mine.<br /><br />I settled in for what I thought would be a great read...one that would capture me from the beginning.  I was so excited as I flipped to page one, as I am with only a few books that promise to be great.  I began my journey into the Fifty Shades.<br /><br />OK, after 10 pages I thought, \\"it's only the beginning\\".  After 40 pages I thought, \\"It's gonna get better\\".  After 75 pages I began to wonder what I was missing.  And after 100 pages I thought \\"This can't be just me?\\".  I logged back onto to Amazon and started reading in earnest all the reviews.  Thank goodness there were many like me who could not understand the allure of this book.<br /><br />For anyone thinking of purchasing this book I would say think about these things.  Can you read a book that seems like it was written by a junior high school creative writing student?  Can you bear dialogue that is so sophomoric as to make you want to puke?  Can you stand characters that are so incredibly boring that you can't possibly be engaged by them?  Can you stand a story that goes nowhere fast?<br /><br />OK, in all honesty I couldn't finish the book.  It was too painful reading such trite dialogue and hoping against hope that something interesting and engaging might happen.  But 100 pages was enough.  I just kept thinking, \\"How in the world did this book ever get published?\\".  And then thinking, \\"I'm not a writer but if she could do it I certainly couldn't do any worse!\\"<br /><br />So readers....think before you leap.  Don't listen to the hype.  At least try a sample chapter.  If that grabs you, so be it.  If it doesn't, remember it gets no better.<br /><br />Kudos, though, to E.L. James for an astonishing coming out party.  Don't know how you did it, but please hook me up with your publisher.  I have a story I've been working on that I think he/she will really like!
B0006A9FMI|5|Saturday, January 01, 2005 / 5 of 5 / Dense, complex, and beautiful.<br />Once again we have an excellent addition to the Ghost in the Shell cannon joining the original, and the stand alone Complex versions.  This anime has a dense and complex thematic plot, bringing philosophical questions of identity and self again to the forefront as cyborg agent Batou must investigate the mysterious malfunctioning and suicides of beautiful doll like mecha children.  Aiding him whenever he enters the Net is the first film's Major whose ghost has gone on to merge with the Puppet Master  into the electronic web.  While the story is slow to unfold, its intellectual dialogue and mystical quality is marvelously paired with the CG effects, the 2d animation, and the haunting score.  For those who can appreciate a good winding story, this is an excellent thinking man's anime. Highly recommended.<br /><br />[Update 2/10/17]: The newly released Blu-ray is sumptuous in its presentation, the warm color timings and effects are just gorgeous in high def. My feelings about the story haven't changed since I last viewed and reviewed this 12 years ago, heh.  Very dialogue dense with episodic action; it's a bit different than any of the other entries in the mythos.

B00846REIS|3|Eva was ready for her new job, for her new apartment with her best friend and a new city. She wanted to time herself on how long it would take her to get to work. That day, she stumbled on a very serious eye candy wearing a very expensive suit. Come to find out he works in the same building. Things get very interesting when her office ends up with Mr. Eye Candy's account. There's some twist and turns on both main characters. By the end of the book we see what is Eva's dark secret, but just an idea on the eye candy. The book leaves you standing by for the next book.
B008QTVNUI|5|I had to buy this on DVD, because at the time, that's the only way it was accessible (without a cable connection).  I also wound up buying it on Amazon Instant Video, so I can watch it on the go or share it with friends who would appreciate the plot twists and character development.  Homeland is fabulous!
B007J4T2G8|5|I related to this story. I understood his torchered anguish and her complete innocence. It's first love for both. It's a first of many moments they never had with anyone else. They are in awe of each other. Though he is experienced and wealthy, he is not familiar with love. He is so blindsided by his feelings for her, he feels angry and confused. In her innocence, she doesn't realize she is a force to be reckoned with. I cried at the end. Cannot wait to read the second book. I hope the movie does the book justice.

B008Y6RGFE|5|Very good movie
B00A6CCF0K|3|I'm not going to give a synopsis, you can find that in other reviews. I enjoyed the book and it was a quick read, but I liked it if was a stand alone story and not a sequel to The Shining. The Shining is one of my all time favorite King books and I found this book as a sequel extremely disappointing. You only get about two actual chapters that carry on the story from the first book. The rest is a bit kooky and not true horror like The Shining.

I won't begrudge him 4 stars, but the 5th....well....Atonement doesn't come along every day of the week!
B00003CXHJ|5|Frankly, one of my favorite movies. Cannot complain about anything on this one. DVD received in a padded envelope and still fully sealed. If you are looking to buy, go for it! You won't be disappointed by the movie or the tangible product.
B009NQKPUW|2|Here's the whole plot of this movie: A gooey substance is ingested by a guy who has sex with a girl who cuts a squid fetus out of her which then grows up and impregnates an alien who gives birth to another alien that looks like the alien used in the artwork earlier in the film. Other gooey alien babies come along and join the party.<br /><br />This movie has an amusing concept but sadly it is six years too late - South Park already used this plot device in the episode Go God Go. It would have been nice to see Prometheus use an original plot but apparently Ridley and James are huge South Park fans and decided to enact Mr Garrison's explanation of evolution in a live action sci fi film.<br /><br />In case you're curious, here's the Prometheus plot as explained by Mr Garrison in Go God Go:<br /><br />\\"In the beginning, we were all fish. Okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this retard frog-squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a monkey-fish-frog, and then this monkey-fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey, and that made you. So there you go, you're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations!\\"<br /><br />Hope I didn't ruin the movie for you.
B00VFTA70I|1|Bad Movie, not even worth a satr
B000002C1W|3|In 1987, after a lengthy court case and bad blood, David Gilmour, and Nick Mason decided to carry on as Pink Floyd. The result was the album &quot;A Momentary Lapse Of Reason&quot;. The songs arent so bad, in fact they are quite catchy. The only thing missing is Roger Waters unifying vision. This album sounds like a David Gilmour solo album. But he had an army of session musicions to assist him in the production. Bob Ezrin (The Wall) also produced and co-wrote several tracks. Its a very enjoyable album with strong songwriting, but to me it doesn't meet Pink Floyd standards.

B00CL68NOG|5|excellent
B0034G4ORC|2|------------------------------------------------  \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\"  (2011)  ------------------------------------------------  This is a very loud movie, with a pretty clumsy script.  Meant to be sort of a sci-fi update of \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" with a grunt's-eye view of an alien invasion of Earth, seen from the perspective of a Marine unit sent into the battle zone to save a handful of civilians.  The \\"War Of The Worlds\\" premise is appealing, but the delivery is leaden - the constant screaming and on-screen mayhem is quickly monotonous and numbing, none of it delivered with the directorial grace that would make it worthwhile. Plus the script is corny and riddled with inconsistencies, such as the indestructible aliens getting easier and easier to kill as the movie goes on.  I watched the whole thing because I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff, but I didn't really enjoy it much and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I suspect the title, \\"Battle, colon, Los Angeles\\" was chosen because they thought -- hopefully -- this could be turned into a franchise, with the battles of New York, Paris, being made as sequels. Well, that could be okay f they get more skillful producers and way better scripts.  This one was kind of leaden and uninvolving.  Axton)

B00656C6KK|5|Received it today and I've played it a few times already. I really enjoy it. I'm 43 years old, still love watching her movies and I really enjoy her voice. She sounds great. I know these were recorded in the 1980's, but even then she'd have been in her 60's and she still sounds like we all remember. It's nice to take a step back from the reality of life as we know it today and just listen to real singing. I hope others enjoy it as well.

B00ILHW6AG|3|A young boy's faith is destroyed when he learns that his young pastor has turned from God because of a tragic accident that cost him his wife and son, which says that young boy's faith wasn't in God to begin with. Years of escapism, addictions, and failures intertwine the 2 characters, the boy growing into manhood and mostly a waste of existence, the former preacher devoting himself to a &#34;secret electricity&#34; that he believes hold the promise of resurrecting the dead. Both callously use those about them, and the end was easily seen in the beginning. This is one of those books that appear to be Stephen King's &#34;pocket change&#34; work; it will sell because his name is on it, but it comes no where near the genius of which he is capable, i.e., The Stand. I have been a long-time fan of Stephen King, & usually buy each new book the moment it is available. After this last disappointment, I will be reading them from a library before spending money; it is quite possible that I will not like them enough to read them again.
B00005K9QP|5|I once dated a woman who had this album, and she always liked to play it on Sundays mornings. Of course it can be played at any time, but I do often play it at weekend while cleaning up the house. Once you promise yourself that you will play the Bluesbreakers album while cleaning up the bathroom, you just can't wait to get started on that toilet bowl.<br />Incongruous? Maybe, but then what could be more incongruous than a bunch of English guys singing the work songs of black men imprisoned on Mississipi's notorious Parchman Farm, a.k.a. Mississipi State Penitentiary, an institution that even now is rarely out of the news and, even if it has been temporarily replaced by Guantanamo Bay, is still a byword for inhumane treatment of prisoners (also see John Grisham's 'The Chamber')?<br />Who cares? Here you have the young Eric Clapton playing up a storm on guitar, some funky harmonica from John Mayall, a bass player who would later achieve fame and fortune with Fleetwood Mac. If you like electric blues-rock, the only question is why you don't already have this classic album. Also, if you care, you have the first recorded Clapton lead vocal on Ramblin' On My Mind, a freshman effort that arguably eclipses the warblings of the somewhat feeble vocal chords of John Mayall.<br />So there you have it. A classic album. Enough said.
B000SINT52|4|This was a very well done film and right on the mark I think! Michael covered all the issues in a professional way and definitely gave the audience something to think about.

B003JJA59K|3|I've never read the book, and honestly don't care to. I do however watch movies... and that's what this review is going to be about.<br /><br />First off \\"The Road\\" had all the right elements but they somehow had all the wrong ones too.<br /><br /> The movie is mainly about a man and his son who are traveling on their last hope. The man knows that where ever he goes there will be nothing, and  I'm quite sure the boy does too. However, they decide to believe in the lie that there is hope beyond the horizon.<br /><br />Watching the movie you realize that they travel this \\"road\\" because it's what keeps them alive. The \\"hope\\" or as they call it in the film the \\"fire\\" that they carry will lead them on. The film has this surreal Planet Of The Apes vibe going on. Something devastating has happened to the planet and yet it remains a complete mystery as to what or how.<br /><br />Most of the movie revolves around the relationship of the Father and his daughter... umm er I mean Son. The Father character is a bit naive or should I say he is cautiously naive. He takes all the precautions to avoid potential danger yet he still ends up heading right into it. It also doesn't help that his goal is to get his Son (might as well had been his daughter) to become more independent so that he could continue to survive in his absence.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this idea is that the Son who is about 11 acts more like a 4 year old girl. Whining,crying,hanging on to his father, throwing tantrums, etc.etc. This kid wouldn't make it 2minutes without being eaten if his father wasn't around. The role of the boy would of made more sense if he was a girl the way the Father treated him. The actor they got for the role was extremely annoying! If he wasn't whining he was crying and if he wasn't crying he was whining. If the kid was 3 or 4 understandable... but the kid was about 11-12.<br /><br />Another thing about the movie is that absolutely no one seems to have any will to survive. They are all just waiting to die and buying their time. (possible spoiler) Like when the Fathers wife just decides she would rather die than live because it's too stressful for her...so she just walks outside to die. What was that about? Why didn't the father just literally slap some sense into her. Throughout the entire movie it's just talking about suicide and walking from point A to point B.<br /><br />The story has some action sequences and interesting moments... but it has no climax. It just them walking around and running into dangerous situations occasionally. The more interesting parts of the movie are watching the cannibals and all their scenes. Makes you think how awesome the movie could have been if it was about them instead.<br /><br />Overall this movie is okay if you can put up with a whiny boy girl.r time.

0743297334|2|I suppose its bad form to say something negative about a classic like The Sun Also Rises, but to me the book clearly demonstrated the emptiness and futility of living a life without purpose.  I think this book communicates a message about a generation of utterly lost individuals - searching for meaning and significance in the trivial stuff they do, but in the end living lives of despair without true happiness.  Great book to read for that significant life lesson - and the fact that Hemingway writes so well.

0790732521|4|As Michael Collins is going to be one of the three individuals in the Irish independence movement from the Easter Rising to the formation of the Irish Free state that I'll be examining in my senior seminar paper next semester, I refreshed myself in rewatching this movie.  Director Neil Jordan (The Crying Game) paints a vivid portrait of the history of the final and crucial Irish Revolution against the British Empire and the man who made it possible, Michael Collins, &quot;The Big Fella,&quot; (1890-1922).  If one was to make the comparison of the Pen, Voice and the Sword made on the three main people who united Italy (Mazzini, Cavour, and Garibaldi), Collins was Ireland's Garibaldi, but also its Christ.<br />The movie begins with 29 April 1916, the last day of the Easter Rising, where the undermanned Irish surrendered to superior British artillery.  Collins and his friend Harry Boland are captured and fortunately avoid the fate of others like Sean MacDiarmida, and socialist intellectual James Connolly, the latter who is badly wounded and is executed strapped to a chair.  Eamon de Valera, future president of Ireland many times over, has his sentence commuted, partially because of his New York birth.<br />Collins learns from the mistakes of the Rising and with the help of Harry and Joe O'Reilly, sets about creating a band of assassins who use intelligence, wear the uniform as the ordinary man on the street, and the element of surprise to gun down members of the Royal Irish Constabulary and G-Men.  Both groups are considered collaborators with the British, traitors to Irish independence.  Before long, British elite police auxiliaries, the notoriously brutal Black and Tans are sent in, and they too become targets for the IRA.<br />There is a standout scene reminiscent of the final scene in the Godfather, where Collins' gunmen take out members of the Cairo Gang, British intelligence specialists who operated in the Middle East and were sent to deal with the IRA, quickly followed by the infamous massacre at a football game, where 14 people, including footballer Sam Hogan, were gunned down by the British searching for Sinn Feiners, and over a hundred wounded.  Bloody Sunday indeed!  While not condoning the British treatment of the Irish, it shows how retaliatory violence leads to the deaths of the innocent.  But as history has shown, there was no other way for the Irish, except by fighting.<br />Many aspects or themes from Tim Pat Coogan's biography on Collins have either been altered or not emphasized, which is understandable for a movie with limited running time.  For example, Ned Broy, the G-man who secretly helps Collins, survived instead of being tortured and killed.  Three Irishmen were tortured and executed the day before, and Jordan clearly decided to use their deaths and Broy as a composite character.  Another is the band of assassins Collins uses to carry out his hits.  Coogan's book refers to them as the Twelve Apostles, which using a Christ-like metaphor to Collins as the saviour of Ireland.  That isn't alluded to here, which is unfortunate.  And the action slows down in the final quarter hour, a contrast to the first two hours.<br />The leads do well, Liam Neeson (Collins), Aidan Quinn (Harry Boland), Julia Roberts (Kitty), Alan Rickman (de Valera), and Ian Hart (Joe O'Reilly).  The latter two would be reunited in the first Harry Potter movie as Professor Snape and Quirrel, respectively.<br />Those who know the story of Michael Collins will know how the story ends, but there is cutting back and forth of scenes of Kitty trying out her wedding dress to the final ambush, with Sinead O'Connor haunting rendition of the traditional &quot;She Moved From The Fair&quot; making it all the more poignant.  And de Valera is portrayed as someone who wants independence but with strategic violence, not the bloodbath Collins spreads, and but in the end, a Machiavellian manipulator.  Indeed, he did say that Collins legacy came at the costof de Valera's own standing, and that is definitely true in this movie.of de Valera's own standing, and that is definitely true in this movie.
006202406X|1|Maybe having happy endings in novels is a cliche but WHO CARES. Clearly, seeing all these 1 star reviews, that's what everyone wants! And that's what Tris and Tobias deserved. The ending is sickeningly sad it is so disappointing. I can't decided if it makes you cry because you're sad for Tobias or because you're so upset that the series ended this way! Half of me feels like I would've felt better just reading the first 2 and never reading this disappointing ending.

B00BDZV7WQ|3|[[ASIN:B00BDZV7WQ I Am Not a Human Being II DLX EX]] serves as Lil Wayne's follow-up to 2010s [[ASIN:B00437DYLI I Am Not A Human Being]].  Like any Lil Wayne album, it is completely outrageous and over-the-top.  The problem is this go-round, Lil Wayne is completely overwrought and at times over-recycles previous ideas; he doesn't always sound fresh.  Many of the MC's signature topics are afloat (women, substances, violence), but often the stupidity and crass nature of the rhymes can turn off even the most avid hip-hop fan. It's by no means a horrid album, but it definitely falls short of Tha Carter series and paints the MC as incredibly immature.<br /><br />\\"IANAHB\\" opens the effort, finding Lil Wayne accompanied by dramatic piano that musically 'punches' when he does lyrically.  His risqu&eacute; endeavors are present from the start, with Wayne making every sensual allusion he can including one at the conclusion in regards to the piano.  On \\"Curtains\\", Weezy channels his inner `Future', pop-rapping through autotune.  Weezy is incredibly salacious here, perverting Chick-fil-a and attaining extra 'nastiness' from guest collaborator Boo.  \\"Days and Days\\" returns the MC to rapping sans autotune and sounds more 'signature', lifted by superb production by Cool & Dre and a brief guest spot from 2 Chainz.  \\"Gunwalk\\", similarly is strong, but does suffer from Wayne's controversial stance on gun control/violence: \\"I'm strapped up [...] a gun law / see me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk...\\" Weezy is discontent to leave pistols just as they are, taking it to the next level by comparing it to anatomy.<br /><br />\\"No Worries\\" is familiar and a crowd-pleaser, aided by Detail's production work.  Weezy manages a solid punch-line or two, specifically \\"I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers / you don't get dissed you get disfigured...\\"  Unfortunately, the five-and-a-half minute \\"Back To You\\" misses, with Lil Wayne clumsily going 'small' with all things lascivious.  What's worst is he choose to approach his sensual desires as a pop-rap, ballad.  \\"Trigger Finger\\" isn't quite atonement, but much more bearable.  The two clumsiest aspects of \\"Trigger Finger\\"? Wayne references sizzurp (bad timing) and Soulja Boy's silly guest verse. \\"Beat The...\\" is violent, much like \\"Gunwalk\\" but less satisfying.  \\"Rich As...\\" proceeds, featuring the assist from 2 Chainz on the hook.  The most redeeming qualities of \\"Rich As...\\" are the references to other songs, including Wayne's own \\"No Worries\\" and Chief Keef's \\"I Don't Like\\".  Disturbing are the drug references.<br /><br />\\"Trippy\\" is all about 'trees', featuring Juicy J.  Mike Will Made It's production on the popular single \\"Love Me\\" is brilliant, and the hook by Future and Drake is the biggest selling point.  Lil Wayne's pop-raps are ok, but it's the hook that really electrifies.  Some deluxe versions feature the clumsy \\"Romance\\", which derails the true meaning/feeling of the word; it is a new low, even for Lil Wayne. \\"God Bless Amerika\\" isn't too shabby and generally has a better message than the multitude.  That said, Lil Wayne can't keep things completely appropriate, even for one cut.  \\"Wowzers\\" message is as expected - the bedroom.  Soulja Boy delivers great production while Lil Wayne spits some of the nastiest rhymes ever. Adding to the sinfulness is none other than rap's riskiest female MC, Trina.  \\"Hello\\", featuring Shane Heyl closes clumsily, reminiscing back to the MC's [[ASIN:B001TD1XWG Rebirth]] days.<br /><br />The Deluxe version (in addition to \\"Romance\\" on some editions), features three other cuts.  \\"Lay It Down\\" is a winner, featuring guest verses from Gunplay and Nicki Minaj.  The production is superb by all means. \\"Hot Revolver\\" misses, but early single \\"My Homies Still\\" proves why it should have graced the standard version.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00BDZV7WQ I Am Not a Human Being II DLX EX]]  is 'good enough' but not a great Lil Wayne album. It doesn't bomb, but it also doesn't captivate like say [[ASIN:B001E4IY3Q Tha Carter III]].  Too often the rhymes aren't truly thoughtful, just sounding like a vulgar, ludicrous mess. The production is hot, even some of the hooks, but at times 'Lil Tunechi' just sounds lukewarm at best.  3 Stars.te like say [[ASIN:B001E4IY3Q Tha Carter III]].

B00785P2QC|5|This game is so fun. Its really addicting and I haven't a single problem yet. Yeah, the whole money type thing. is expensive, I work around it!
B00846F1YW|1|Did NOT love this game!! I HATED the sillouttes that were shown instead of the actual word for the object to find .. a HUGE disappointment
B006LSZECO|2|This was an interesting premise and one that I felt like could've been done with a lot more class and tact. The number of f-bombs and crass language made me feel like I was reading a cook written by an angry teenager. Also, the ending was so utterly depressing it left me feeling unsatisfied and like I'd just wasted a lot of time reading it. I can't figure out why this particular author is so successful when her books are so depressing.

B00005JN7O|2|Every so often a movie comes out which nearly the whole world seems to love, and I seem to be the only one out there who just doesn't think it's all that great.  Such is the case with SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.  The previews to this movie made it look like it was going to be one of the best movies to come out this year.  But I found this film to be quite forgettable (in spite of the fact that it does have several genuinely enjoyable parts). <br /> <br />The fact of the matter is that SKY CAPTAIN runs away with a plot and does not bother to invite the viewer along.  The storyline is set en media res - a Latin phrase which means \\"in the middle of things\\" - implying that there was a lot of previous goings on between the main characters, but these things are told in such a contrived and unoriginal way that I thought I was watching Indiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood duke it out over their bitter affair from yesteryear (reference from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK). <br /> <br />My primary problem with this film is not the unemotional dialogue or the overwhelming amount of CGI (which almost never makes a movie look good) but the fact that the filmmakers could not decide what they wanted this film to be.  It almost works as a vintage throwback to the old classic serials of the 1930s.  It almost works as a comic book come to life.  It almost works as a marvelous special effects show.  It almost works as an Indiana Jones-type thriller (I personally think they were overdoing that one just a tad.)  And it almost works as an artistic cinematic experiment.  But the people who made this film decided to throw all of these ingredients into the same bowl, hoping for the best.  Sometimes a movie can be all of those things, but it's a rarity.  SKY CAPTAIN makes a valiant effort but runs out fuel just short of the landing strip.  Got kids?  Take them to see this movie for some good clean fun.  But don't expect too much substance.

The Dark Knight Rises Bonus Features 6.Ultimate Trilogy Bonus Features a book containing stills and quots from all 3 films a letter to the fans from Christopher Nolen and a set of 3 got wheels cars one of the Tumblr, one of the Tumblr Bike and one of The Bat now while all of this is nice it's still not worth the asking price of 60$ but if you can find it on sale then it's well worth it the packaging is great the documentary is really good and it's one of the best trilogies of all time and that's why I give it's 4 stars
B007IXWL2C|5|One of my favorites, I also loved book 2 but it was great how book 3 ended the story, I hope there will be more from this author!

0425263908|4|Some people say that this book is better than Fifty Shades of Grey... I found myself comparing them too much, however I don't agree. Both reads are easy to predict nonetheless worth reading and I would recommend for a pleasurable read.
B00BD99JMW|2|The conclusion of this book left me feeling dead and depressed on the inside. Our mysterious, lovable Four becomes a whiny weakling and our heroine dies. What a dreamy ending, right? The plot really isn't exciting as the first two books. As I kept reading the book, my usual excitement deflated with each chapter and the author kept killing off good characters in the book for no apparent reason. Veronica Roth really knows how to butcher a good series. What was the point in writing a book that cast no inspiration for the reader's to take with them? Tris' death was not inspiring. It felt like defeat. The story leaves their world with doom, gloom, and death. I hope the movie script for Allegiant deviates a lot from the book.
B00IKZX1ZI|4|Great thanks
B00IXF85CY|5|This is a story of a young girl in Germany during Hitler's reign.  As a young girl her mother sent her to live with a couple who became her parents.  After reading the book first, I would say this movie kept true to the book.  The story will easily capture your interest.  Worth watching.
1587990717|5|This book is an extended narrative on our inept ability to account for randomness.  First, we don't do a good job of attributing the correct proportion of random luck to skill in life's ups and downs. We assume our good fortune is skill and bad fortune is luck.  We don't split it down the middle, it is either luck or skill, not a blend. Taleb calls this probability blindness. Probability blindness is a term for our inability to maintain the existence of simultaneous realities.  The glass is about full or about empty.  It cannot be 'about full' and 'about empty' simultaneously.<br />Second, we forget the drop outs, and focus on the survivors.  Taleb calls this the 'Survivor bias'.  If you train a million monkeys to pound on a million typewriters for an infinite amount of time, one of them will write an exact duplicate of a Shakespeare sonnet. Still the 'surviving monkey' who produces a great sonnet has achieved this through pure luck..  The effort is entirely random. We are simply prone to attribute the 'one' monkey's success with skill, just because he was randomly chosen to have the winning lottery ticket.<br />In financial markets, a flim-flam stock broker uses the survivor bias to make big bucks.  He sends 5000 people a letter saying the market is going up, and 5000 a letter saying it will go down.  A month later, the 5000 recipients of the 'correct' letter, get a second letter.  Half get the up message, the other half get the down message. A month later, the 2500 recipients of the winning call get a third letter, 1250 up and 1250 down.  The 1250 who have now gotten 3 correct calls in a row, receive solicitations and 200 invest in the broker's offshore fund. The flim-flam man disappears with a million dollars.<br />Why do the 200 invest?  They forget that surviving the test does not imply skill.  They are fooled by randomness.<br />While interesting, this is not unfamiliar.  Taleb throws in a very useful twist, though.  He points out that knowing this doesn't insure  we do any better.  As Taleb puts it, 'my only advantage is my awareness of my frailty.'<br />The humility invoked here raises this book to an entirely more interesting level.  I was reminded of Thomas Merton's anti-biography, '7 Storied Mountain'. Like Merton, Taleb seems to spend more time contradicting himself and going on odd tangents.  For example, we are treated to a digression on honorable suicides and the sweet poetry people wrote to remember the practitioners.  In another section, we are advised to treat people as Martians because they become easier to ignore.  Like Merton, Taleb's style of delivery tells us more than the words alone can communicate, we must fumble through the paradoxes. This isn't a book on doing probability, its about developing humility.  There is no prescription for defeating our instincts, only advice for living with them.  In this, you find the best the book has to offer .<br />Taleb suggests he is tortured by probability.  It is not an 'interest,' it is an obsession. How refreshing an insight.  His drive doesn't come from 'reason', it comes from his emotional constitution. Not the sort of stuff you usually hear.ure  we do any better.

B00000J7JO|5|Generally, I am a fan of pop music and of the current teeny bopper artists like Christina Aguilera Britney Spears and NSYNC.  Yet, one day I heard Scar Tissue being played on MTV and I just was amazed by this song.  I had  never been a RHCP fan; yet, I seemed to love &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;.  I  decided to buy the CD and give it a try.  Buying the CD was the best CD  purchase I made this year.  Immediately, this CD was one of my favorites.   &quot;Around the World&quot; is probably my favorite sog because the song  is a mix of RAP and ROCK.  It is an awesome song.  I noticed recently that  the CD tells the story of their lives which is way cool.  Another song that  everybody will enjoy is probably &quot;Otherside&quot;  which I interpret  as Anthony Kiedis recalling his experiences with drugs.  Truly a must have  for any fan of any genre of music!

0385349947|3|Me - an executive mom and the daughter of an executive mom. So needless to say, I was super excited to read this book and get inspired. I was looking forward to the controversial messaging I had heard so much about on the news, but I was sorely disappointed. One would have to be ridiculously sensitive to interpret Sandberg's message as harsh or critical towards women. It's basically an editorial of her personal workplace experiences with women, the scientific research to back up her claims, and some ways women can recognize these behaviors. I had never heard of her prior to this book so the 'coming up' personal biography portions were boring to me, I liked the motivating messages much better, more of that please!

B008PZ69T8|5|Basically this CD is various classical songs that were mentioned in the book. I think it's a nice collaboration, and I find it very calming. Even if you didn't read the books, I think it's a nice classical collection. There's nothing sexual about this other than the implications behind the name. I expect these songs will be featured in the movie, once it's released. Purchased this for my mom for Christmas and she enjoyed it. We both have it on our ipods, and I like listening to it before work for the nice calming effect that it has.
B000GPI2EK|5|That's all I really have to say. Anyone who liked Mastodon before may like them even better now. They've actually improved on their sound with this record. Pretty much the same style as Leviathan with better songwriting, production, and riffs.  No worries about a major label letdown here.  Easily the best metal record of the year so far.  I like the new Slayer and Lamb of God but Mastodon is a step ahead.  \\"Circle of Cysquatch\\" in particular is just an awesome song with a killer intro riff and awesome verse. What can I say, Mastodon rules!
B0068RHGJM|2|All the songs seem like filler, nothing unique or that stands out  - the songs are so formulaic and not interesting enough to want to listen to again,pretentious comes to mind

B00000K0DQ|5|I have never written an online review before. Also, Sean Penn and Sarandon and Tim Robbins have definitely gotten on my nerves in the past. Having said all that, this is a BRILLIANT movie. Sean Penn gives the finest performace, undoubtedly, of his life. He had me in tears for pretty much the whole movie. Susan S is also just amazing, as it director Tim Robbins. Absolutely nothing bad can be said about this movie. It's not overtly political in anyway. But also keep in mind that every form of human expression IS political to some degree. How can it not be?<br /><br />Sean Penn is my new hero, simply by virtue of this movie. Honestly I have never been impressed with him in the past. Maybe I was just missing something. But I have never seen a better onscreen performance than the one he gave.<br /><br />See it. You'll be an emotional basketcase afterwards, but you will appreciate this movie.

B003XT603Q|5|Haruki Murakami’s Norwegian Wood is a masterfully written coming of age story that takes place in 1969 Tokyo. It’s the story of college student Toru Watanabe, who must make a choice – follow the girl he loves as she wanders farther and farther into darkness, or leave her behind in the hope of finding a brighter path. To say that this is all it is, is a disservice to the author’s acumen.<br /><br />Murakami composes prose with the deceptively simple, but flowing elegance of a master songwriter. (A note of praise must be given to Murakami’s English translator, Jay Rubin.) Murakami has captured the era with the accuracy of one who lived through it—something he did. The dialogue has all the deftness of Hemingway’s. The characters are complex, breathing beings that transcend the written page. Most importantly, Murakami unwinds the tale in a manner that makes it impossible to stop reading.<br /><br />At times laugh out loud funny, at times heart wrenching, at times erotic (though never sleazy), Norwegian Wood is the author at his best. My only regret—and it was a big one—was that the story ended and I could no longer spend time in this captivating world.

0439023521|4|Incredibly addictive read, even if it's meant for grade-schoolers... The plot line and the world conceived by the author, Collins, are both incredibly disturbing. But somehow it all comes together to form a really fun read that you will not be able to put down. Plus, just learned the movie's coming out next March (2012), and it stars Woody Harrelson and Lenny Kravitz... what's not to love?
B002FRNCG0|4|I'm not a big fan of Paramore per se but when they released \\"Riot!\\" I found myself attracted to their music. Somehow, I found that album \\"too comercial\\" from what I like but still some songs were pretty enjoyable (\\"That's what you get\\" is by far my favorite). I was intrigued about the release of this album and hesitating as well cause I didn't know if I should buy it. Well, I decided to go for it and my first impression of this new record is that \\"I love all the facts that make other reviewers hate it\\". Yes, this is not as catchy as \\"Riot!\\" and here there are no smash hits as the way they were in that album but, while everybody hates that I just love it. I find Paramore trying not to repeat themselves while they're playing these songs and eventhough they end up to DO repeat themselves in most of the songs... I appreciate the effort they make (songs like \\"Careful\\", \\"Brick by boring brick\\" and \\"Turn it off\\" are some ecamples of this). On the other hand, eventhough the lyrics are light and for a teenage style (which is ok considering that Hayley Williams is still in her teenage years someway, somehow) by moments Hayley finds clever lines to say and most of all, pretty much honest in comparison to the bunch of crap that new bands say these days in their lyrics. For this matter I consider worth to mention what she says on the song \\"Feeling sorry\\" (....I feel no symphaty, you live inside a cave, you barely pass by, the rest of us are trying, there's no need to apologize, there's no time for feeling sorry.... all the best lies are told with fingers tied).<br /><br />Musically, I find Paramore's style afraid of experimenting how their songs would sound without the \\"has-to-be distortioned-sound\\" i think if they try to experiment a little bit more with their guitars they might find better results on their songs. Of course, this is still a new band we're talking about here (only 3 albums recorded) hence, I'm expecting that they do an album like \\"Brand new eyes\\" nowadays in 2009. I just hope that in their future they find themselves in a different mental state and a different aura around them to get inspired to come up with their best album. Honestly, I have never cared much about bands from their generation (Fall out boy, panic at the disco, the academy is...) just because i just don't waste my time listening to pretencious,shallow songs about teennage love from a bunch of kids saying nothing at all while they're playing too loud to hide the fact that they SUCK but, Paramore has something that any of these bands have.... passion and love for making music that they like. Just remember that that is how bands like The Smiths or R.E.M. started (not that I'm comparing them though).9.

0385486804|5|It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to write a review of thisbook without pronouncing judgments.  But let me be clear from theoutset that I am not here joining the ongoing debate into thecharacter, motivations or judgment of either Chris McCandless or Jon Krakauer.  Such detachment is not easy as this volume is both a biography and autobiography of values, and I have discussed it from that perspective with my own family and friends.<br />The book is well-written, and Krakauer has performed a neat bit of detective work in piecing together McCandless' story.  The subject matter-- a young man's odyssey...-- is compelling.  I suspect that the extensive number of reviews reflects just how compelling and contentious the subject of this book is.  The paperback suffers from the lack of photgraphs and visual documentation available in the hardcover edition.  The stark, essential facts are still here, however.<br />Krakauer's own bias is clear and admitted.  That is to his credit.  There is no rule that says an author must be detached.  Indeed, Krakauer's involvement in his story strengthens and focuses his prose.<br />I strongly recommend this book to other parents.  If it makes you think and worry, and if it inclines you to ACT by teaching children basic survival skills, so much the better.

B0000047CX|5|When &quot;The Girl From Ipanema&quot; first hit the airwaves I was just 17 yrs old. I was blown away. I immediately bought the Getz/Gilberto album, and thus began my collection of Brazilian music.  When I saw this  remastered version I bought two (one for a sibling). Thank you to Verve for  reviving it. I've bought many albums in my lifetime but this is the one I  listen to more so than any other. The track &quot;Para Machucar Meu  Coracao&quot; is so beautiful - a masterpiece by the composer Ari Barroso  who also composed &quot;Brazil&quot;. Jobim performs the best version of  &quot;Brazil&quot; in his album &quot;Stone Flower&quot; - it's worth  hunting it down. It is music that touches your soul and inspires the  spirit.

B007ZXK08C|4|Great book. Had me hooked throughout. Not a huge fan of the ending.
B00BD99JMW|1|Worst book I have ever read. I have never read the third book of a trilogy that was more disjointed that this. It honestly felt as if Veronica Roth didn't write this book. The style was completely different than the other books. They finally get to the outside world and it was SO BORING! It just never took off. And then,,,, I won't say it, but the worst ending ever. I can't discourage readers enough but to say &#34;don't even waste your valuable time on this book!&#34;. Veronica- you really should be ashamed to attach your name to this and to take our money for this book. Your editor should be ashamed. And you really let this fan down. What a huge disappointment.

0767802659|5|C'mon, I know Titanic was expensive, but the special effects in this movie are state of the art (simply the best I've ever seen). But, since Titanic was more expensive. The special effects aren't the only thing, the  screenplay is incredible and the actors are &quot;acceptable&quot;. And the  actors are well-chosen ones. Michalel Ironside is simply incredible with  his army sadistical look, and Casper Van Dien was &quot;a good  soldier&quot;. I saw this movie four times and I didn't get bored, 'cause  the action is unstoppable. It's just shooting and flying, but with style.  And the bugs... oh the bugs. I'm sure you wouldn't like to meet a Tanker  Bug face to face, hehehe.
B00BD99JMW|5|I loved the story, However, I have come up with at least 7 different more satisfying endings. Mrs. Roth really should not have killed off Tris.
630587493X|5|This is such a good movie!  It's much more serious that the usual Robin Williams movies, and I think he was an excellent choice for the role. Watching anything with Sam Neill starring in it is an added bonus.  I wish the storyline had allowed a way for him to play a longer role in the movie.<br /><br />Awesome addition to mycollection
B005EWDA9M|3|As a result of a dysfunctional childhood, Murakami’s principal characters Aomame, Tengo and Fuka-Eri are displaced people. They’ve each experienced parental oppression and abuse, whether from Jehovah’s Witnesses, an obsessive insurance salesman, or the leader of a mystery cult. They become involved in alternative behaviour. Aomame executes sex offenders, Tengo’s life is minimalist, Fuka-Eri is partially disconnected. They inhabit a parallel universe with two moons and the existence of the menacing ‘Little People’. They are obsessed with sex.<br /><br />Murakami weaves a gripping thriller to the climax of Aomame’s ultimate act on page 643, but after that the book becomes flat and trundles on endlessly for a further 160 pages. But is he also saying something? Perhaps social displacement inevitably constructs alternative paradigms? Maybe awareness of another realm is an option? Perhaps stripped of our sophisticated modern civilisation, sex is obsessive in our more primitive being? These are interesting possible interpretations, but if he intends them, Murakami leaves them too obscure.<br /><br />Geoff Crocker Editor Atheist Spirituality web site

B009KY5OGC|4|The US government should have a National recognition for Native Americans. An honoring such as a national holiday for the ultimate sacrifice these men women and children have experienced. The atrocities are no less in tragedy than  the Nazi's of WWII. It's the least the government can do to bring recognition of sufferings these peaceful people endured. Like many non human species, many Native people their ways and their bloodlines are now extinct thru systematic alienation. Their plight is no less an atrocity then African American slavery.

B0095J0AL6|5|I knew before I bought this album that it would be perfection, so when I got Take Me Home, I was completely overjoyed. The boys have done it again and the tracks are sensational.

B004Y1USV2|5|I have been a YES fan since the 70's and have enjoyed just about every album they have released.  FLY FROM HERE is YES in top form.  I have enjoyed listing to this album over and over again.  You really get into the music and story of the title suite.  The rest of the songs are just awesome.  I really love the balance of all the music and the creativity.  I like Jon Anderson, but Benoit David as lead singer, wow!  He is not a replacement but a welcomed addition.  He sounds really good and blends well with the rest of the band.  YES with Howe, Squire, David, Downes, and White have made an album worth listening to for years to come.  I highly recommend FLY FROM HERE.
B00005JKQZ|4|I always thought that mathematics could drive a person crazy.<br /><br />After watching A Beautiful Mind, I could verify that my theory is not absolutely preposterous.<br /><br />This drama based on a real life history presents Russell Crowe as John Forbes Nash Jr, a mathematical genius whose mind goes through an intense trip from health to madness to health again. The complexity of the brain and its effects in human behavior are explored with a clarifying view in this film.<br /><br />Nash's story begins in 1947, when the \\"mysterious genius of West Virginia\\" arrives at Princeton to attend his studies. Obsessed with come up with a really original idea, Nash is most of the time solving complicated equations in the library, in the large windows of his room and even in the bar where he hangs out with his competitive companions.<br /><br />And it is on a simple day that the idea appears suddenly. His study in the theory of the game audaciously contradicts the Adam Smith's doctrine. One hundred and fifty years of accepted ideas suddenly are not fashionable anymore and Nash's life changes forever. Now working at the recognized MIT, Nash becomes involved with some Cold War investigations, while simultaneously his personal life gives a complete turn when he meets Alicia, a physics student and eventually, his future wife.<br /><br />But the dreamed life of Nash soon crumbles when they diagnose him paranoid schizophrenia. His genius becomes cloudy and from that moment, Nash must fight to apply the logic - the one that once served him to solve complicated theorems- to the disease that every day tries to moves him away more from reality.<br /><br />Narrated from Nash's point of view, the movie tries to baffle us by mixing reality with fantasy; a technique that effectively makes us understand how confused a mind can get.<br /><br />Russell Crowe offers a dramatic interpretation as Nash, as we see him age 40 years in screen. The actor takes a comfortable ride through the different facets of Nash, from the safe, arrogant genius, to the lost and tormented man that`s desperately trying to get rid of his demons.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly, as Alicia, complements Crowe in all senses. Desolated by the disease of her husband, Alicia fights under pressure to continue loving the upset genius and offering the emotional support that he needs so much.<br /><br />Although inevitably the movie falls with its sentimentality, A Beautiful Mind is a film that's worth watching. Is not about mathematics or the important merits Nash offered to the world. It's about his genius, and how he accomplished to control his delirious and how he became not only a person with a truly great mind, but also with a great heart.through the different facets of Nash, from the safe, arrogant genius, to the lost and tormented man that`s desperately trying to get rid of his demons.  <br /> <br />Jennifer Connelly, as Alicia, complements Crowe in all senses.

B006LSZECO|5|This book is so well written.  There was always a twist or unexpected turn in the story line.  The author revealed portions of the characters' personalities gradually throughout the book.  My only complaint would be the profanity.  It wasn't excessive but I did not think it was necessary.
1452126577|5|this book is funny.  my 9 year old son was belly laughing reading some of the comments in the book.  Highly recommend.
B008JGSM6G|4|My granddaughter (age 6) loved this when she first played it.  And I don't mind her playing this as it gets her thinking (it's not a mindless time-waster).  It gets harder as you progress through the formations, so after a while she needs a little help.
B000002L7J|5|This is the Smiths' best album.  Although not as popular as their debut or &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot;, &quot;Meat is Murder&quot; has a more primitive and dark feel than their other releases.  Morrissey's legendary  depression sounds real.  A forgotten masterpiece.
6305696071|5|I have watched this movie so many times, I have it on VHS and dvd, I need another DVD from watching it so much.
B005FVA3LK|5|The quality, presentation, contents and value for the money amaze me. Nothing U2 releases is anything less. However... I wish I could rate Amazon separately for their shipping care. Whatever happened to Amazon's famous quality? This beautiful box arrived partially crushed, not &#34;damaged,&#34; but far less that you'd want for such a beautiful piece. I contacted them but they never replied. Guess I'm stuck with it.
B00FAX6XQC|5|The game is so realistic which is what I love about it. It is challenging when u get really far in the game because u have to have lots of money for all the upgrades for your gun. When u get to the trophy series u will love it because you get to shot the big animals.
B004DK49DW|5|I listened to this cd five times and it grows on me when I am not listening to it.   Mike Ness has been able to tell stories and tell of experiences that always seem to strike close to home and he has done it again.  He has continued to grow as an artist, but he takes his sweet ol time putting out music.  Mike... can you try to go back in the studio in less than eight years?  How about one year?  I guess we were spoiled when both solo albums came out in a single year.      The great thing with Ness and Social Distortion is that it is timeless in that he draws from a rich musical history and tells the human story. California (Hustle and Flow), Gimme the Sweet Lowdown, Diamond in the Rough, Alone and Forsaken, Writing on the Wall and Still Alive are standouts that stay with you long after turning off the music.     I purchased the bonus tunes and they really should have been on the album or an extended album should have been offered for fans to purchase. They are phenomenal.
B007IXWKUK|5|I was introduced to this series by a friend. I wanted to get back into reading, and didn't know what I wanted to read. The trilogy was good. It was hard to put down, but there was a lot of the same &#34;scenes&#34; over and over. I would definitely read it again, and will definitely go to the movie.  But, the repetition could get boring for some.  It's a dirty version of Cinderella meeting her prince.
B00AHSLU2C|5|It's been awhile since I last saw this.  It was just as compelling this time around.  Do all<br />Children's stories start with the untimely death of a family member?
B009PHRIAE|5|love this
B0089LOG02|5|I felt all the fears and sadness, and hope and joy of the characters. Did not want it to end.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|This was a very fun game l really  enjoy the game... I recommended that you get the full version on the kindle
B00005JNDZ|4|Not as good as the first \\"Bridget\\" movie, but actually not that bad. I enjoyed watching it and plan on purchasing the DVD.  Don't expect the movie to be like the book (when are they ever?)because parts are added or changed. I hated Jacinda Barrett's character's \\"secret\\" at the end of the movie and the Thai prison/\\"Like a Virgin\\" scene was also a bit cringe-worthy. Otherwise, an enjoyable movie kept alive by Hugh Grant and Colin Firth.
B00AI5AQPQ|4|The tale of a little girl who utterly destroys her principal and parents.<br /><br />Matilda's family is negligent flirting with abusive, and her school master is much, much worse. The only bright spots in her life are books and her teacher, Miss Honey. But Miss Honey lives in terrible poverty, and when Matilda learns why, she decides to take action.<br /><br />I love the headcanon that Hermione of the Harry Potter books was inspired by this story. I think the pair of them would get along swimmingly.<br /><br />Highly recommended for your little reader, though maybe be a bit cautious if they resent their school officials. While Matilda's retaliation is justified, you don't want your kids getting in trouble if they get inspired.
B008OOYALE|5|Dragon Story has kept my attention for longer than I expected. Lots of variety and different things to do. Just wish it didn't cost so much to clear land.

B00DURGZHW|4|Good movie
B00I6JOBTI|1|I had already pre-ordered this blu-ray before Amazon stopped all new pre-orders and chose to demand more money from Warner Home Video, the distributor of this disc (they're doing the same thing with the Hatchette publishing company, home of the latest JK Rowling novel). Amazon is starting to get too big for its britches - this is what happens when you allow one company to assume a near-monopoly. Therefore, I cancelled my order and ordered it somewhere else at the same price. It's up to Amazon and their greedy ways whether I'll consider any future purchases with them.<br /><br />By the way, the film is AWESOME! The one-star is for the method of purchasing, not the film or the disc set.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I liked this book alot. I didn't expect the story to go where it did. I love Sky/Hope's character. I loved how she didn't let anyone get to her and turned the comments people made around into something funnier for her. Holder is one of my favorite kind of guys. He is kinda quiet and mysterious at first and then once Sky finds out the truth you see how loving and loyal he is. This story made you feel so many different emotions and I enjoyed it alot. I cant wait to read Losing Hope. I cheated and read Finding Cinderella and loved that one as well.
B005FITIGO|3|ok
B00RVC3YKI|1|why was this nominated?
0141000198|4|OK, I have to confess that I saw the movie first, and then read the book.  So, my reaction is very, very much effected by the flick.  But since a fair number of people are going to be in the same position that I was, I thought lovers of the movie who want to know if they should pick up the novel might profit from someone else who had been in the same position.<br />First, I utterly adored the movie, and was genuinely stunned at Renee Zellweger's performance.  I have always been a fan of hers, but she is so thoroughly American that it was very, very hard to imagine her playing a Brit.  I will confess that for the first 15 minutes of the movie that her accent really bothered me.  No, she didn't botch it.  She sounded quite acceptably English.  It was simply that all these scenes from JERRY MAGUIRE and DAZED AND CONFUSED and ME, MYSELF, AND IRENE and NURSE BETTY kept playing in my mind, and in all those she spoke very, very differently.  But once I adjusted, I loved her, her performance, and the movie as a whole.  So much so that I wanted to read the book.<br />Coming to the book after the movie is a mild disappointment.  The primary reason is that Renee Zellweger was so utterly delightful, that the novel suffers somewhat by comparison.  Nonetheless, the book itself has sufficient wit, personality, and diversity to delight someone who has seen the movie first.  There are the usual variances between the events in the novel and those in the book, but a surprisingly large number of events were common to both.<br />I found one thing utterly amazing in the novel:  both of the male leads of the movie are mentioned explicitly in the book.  At one point in the book Bridget decides to watch the BBC production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  She starts comparing her Mark Darcy with the Mr. Darcy of the TV series.  The part of Mr. Darcy in the BBC series was played by Colin Firth, who also played Mark Darcy in the movie.  Furthermore, on her job she suggests that her TV show do a segment on the real life romance between the actors who played Darcy and Elizabeth:  Colin Firth and Elizabeth.<br />The other actor mentioned was Hugh Grant, and his mention was not at all flattering.  In fact, I am somewhat surprised that Hugh Grant agreed to be in the movie given his appearance in the novel.  The novel has a couple of characters debating why Elizabeth Hurley stays with Hugh Grant after his high publicized encounter with a prostitute.  Now, it surprises me that Grant took the role because he surely knew that the flick would increase the number of readers of the book.  On the other hand, perhaps he (probably correctly) assumes that everyone already knows about that incident.  And I have to admit that I do admire the fact that his willingness to be so public after an admittedly embarrassing incident like that does increase my admiration of him.  Not that the incident took place, but that he is determined to get on with his life despite a mistake in judgment.<br />So, I do think that someone who has seen the movie first, will definitely enjoy this book.  And I will add to what has been said by other reviewers:  this book is a very, very fast read.  But also a very, very fun read.t on the real life romance between the actors who played Darcy and Elizabeth:  Colin Firth and Elizabeth.  <br />The other actor mentioned was Hugh Grant, and his mention was not at all flattering.

B000BTC5LW|5|I went to this show at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena back in '94 and it was the most memorable show ever.  I remember it was mixed in surround sound, and when the helicopters came overhead from behind in the segue before \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" part 2, I felt the need to duck while the choppers went by.  It was truly an \\"immersive\\" visual and aural experience.  I've seen this on laserdisc and VHS over the years but neither ever really did justice to the concert.  With this DVD release, and the remixed 5.1 sound by James Guthrie, it finally does justice to the concert.  Now my only wish is that some day an official release of \\"A Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" will make it to DVD.
B0009UC810|5|I don't care who you are, if you ever think of being part of a band then you have to get this movie!  Take it from a person who has been around the music scene since the 1970s, this is classic.
B009ZAY8MM|5|This album is a little more laid-back and traditional than their usual music, but it is still a wonderful example of the beauty of the human voice.  They are a very talented a cappella group and I am always awe struck by their talent.

B00FAPF5U0|5|game itself is fun and without any noticeable glitches I play almost everyday on car rides in doctors office or just at home waiting for dinner to finish cooking its a great easy time kill and you almost feel like maybe just maybe the puzzle type nature of the game keeps your mind active.
B000002H70|4|There are musical and lyrical connections between this and 'Pornography' (for example, anyone who remembered Smith singing 'I will never be clean again' in 'The Figurehead' would have raised an eyebrow at 'You make me feel like I am clean again' in 'Lovesong'). Although 'Disintegration' is far more listenable, the two albums do represent The Cure's career peaks; you can certainly ignore everything that came after them and most of what was in between (ahem). <br /> <br />Nearly all the tracks build slowly through sweetly intertwining lines, providing a welcome distraction from Smith's monotonous 'singing'. In fact if the album had been recorded without his vocals, just with a lyric sheet to read while listening to the instrumental versions, I'd have given it four and a half stars (if Amazon allowed half-stars). As it is, the old whiner manages to mar yet another good record. Oh well, at least the lyrics are worth hearing -- dark, of course, but in this case even darker than you think. <br /> <br />The final half star deducted because it's just too much for one sitting, and as it seems to be some sort of emotional concept album it really needs to be heard in one go. The original vinyl version was a couple of tracks shorter -- 'Last Dance' and 'Homesick' were cut, I think -- and better for it.
0762445262|5|Yes. It's tiny. Like really really tiny. But it's a cute little gift, and he loves it. It actually shines pretty well on the wall, too. Definitely worth the money.
0688163173|2|As others have said, the ending is a mystery story cliche, and not done half as well as other such stories.  The most disappointing part of that, however, was the fact that up to the ending, the writing was quite good and the story was engaging, but I can't forgive the author for that ending.  I won't read any other Dennis Lehane books as a result.
B00HF1KFFM|5|For a long time, I have sought an alternative to old-fashioned incandescent and fluorescent bulbs - the former burn out too quickly and are too fragile, the latter are expensive and, in my experience, rather unreliable.<br /><br />Assuming they last as long as these are supposed to, this is a truly superior technology:  cheap, energy saving, long lasting.  These 75 watts are very bright, you only 12W compared to old-fashioned incandescent bulbs.<br /><br />Recommended with great enthusiasm.

He  even  appears  on  the  other  side  of  the  street  during  the  parade  when  Sam  accuses  him  of  staring  at  his  wife,  &  he  was  but  Sam  wasn't  able  to  tell  everybody  what  Cady  was  doing. &  Max  Cady  tries  to  convince  everybody including  himself  that  he  was  just  watching  the  parade  &  not  hurting  nobody! Cady  did  manage  to  blend  in.  So  far  he  has  a  100%  advantage  over  Sam.  For  Sam  his  situation  with  Cady  is  like  he  was  in  the  twilight  zone  or  something. Max  forgot  one  thing,  maybe  that  is  listed  in  the  bible  I'm  not  sure  myself.  He  left  out  forgiveness.<br />Things  are  happening  all  around  Sam.  A  friend  of  his  gets  raped  &  that's  when  the  terror  begins. I  think  Sam  was  right.  Max  Cady  had  to  of  been  the  one  that  killed  the  family  dog.  But  the  police  said  thats  not  good  enough,  I  need  solid  evidence  in  order  to  nail  this  guy. Nothings  working  how  do  I  get  this  Maniac.  Every  attempt  on  Max Cady  fails  eventually.  &  he  thought  he  had  the  answer  by  hiring  Kersec.  The  one  who  kept  an  eye  on  Cady,  through  him  Kersec  &  Sam  hired  a  gang  of  3  to  do  a  little  hospital  job  on  Cady  after  he  got  after  Daniel  pretending  to  be  a  Drama  teacher  in  the  school  Auditorium.  I  did  like  how  Max  fought  back.  All  3  of  those  guys  whowere  supposed  to  injure  Cady  got  their  tables  turned  on  them.  &  Max  walks  away  just  wounded.  Daniel  was  just  lucky  that  she  didn't  end  up  like  the  other  girl.  Daniel  allows  Cady  to  touch  her,  but  I  don't  think  she  should  of  let  him  give  her  the  Kiss.  He  didn't  say  nothing  about  giving  her  no  long  kiss.  If  Sam  had  known  about  that  he'd  be  all  over  Cady.  He  knew  how  to  torment  Sam  to  get  him  all  fired  up  encouraging  him  in  his  own  to  make  his  move.  The  hospital  job  doesn't  work,  so  they  make  another  move  &  Sam  pretends  he's  leaving  at  the  airport.  That  works  for  a  night  or  2  before  we  here  from  Cady  again.  &  Cady  was  already  in  the  house  sooner  than  Sam  realized.  &  Disguised  as  the  housekeeper.  Kersec  had  his  back  turned.  Grazialla's  accent  seemed  normal,  &  there's  noway  Max  could  have  taken  & Murdered  her  that  quickly.  &  there  was  no  body  on  the  floor  just  yet. It  was  the  Mexican  lady  in  real  life  while  Kersec  was  talking.  The  movie  itself  is  as  scary  as  ever.  The  special  affects  they  put  in  this  movie  are  amazing.  &  Kersec  is  murdered  &  lying  in  a  pool  of  blood  on  the  floor.  Sam Boden  just  had  to  be  angry  enough  to  go  & get  Cady. I must say he wasn't easy to take down.They  decide  to  leave  on  a  getaway  trip  on  the  houseboat  they  own.  They  didn't  have  any  idea  Cady  had  hitched  a  ride  under  the  car  using  a  bungee  cord  to  strap  himself.  Then  Cady  gets  down  to  business. He  was  either  going  to  kill  Sam  or  Sam  was  going  to  kill  him.  He  had  planned  on  harassing  the  girls  sexually,  Sam  tries  to  tell  Cady  leave  them  out  of  it,  its  between  you  &  me,  Cady  smiles  &  says  this  is  my  night  Counselor  don't  you  step  on  my  line!  &  kicks  him  in  the  face  several  times  before  Daniel  sets  his  face  on  fire.  Soon  after  Sam  is  hitting  Cady  with  rocks.  The  frightening  nightmare  is  over.<br />Daniel  narrates  at  the  beginning  &  end  of  the  movie.  No  I  guess  things  wouldn't  be  the  way  they  were  before  Max  Cady  came.  I  didn't  like  Cady  at  first  when  he  was  laughing  there  in  the  movie  theater.  They'd  throw  you  out  of  there  the  management  if  anybody  behaved  like  that  in  real  life.  &  I  myself  thought  Cady  was  a  complete  nutcase  right  then  &  there! Whether  or  not  Max  was  already  stalking  him  I  don't  know. No wonder Sam  had  hell getting the upper hand.  Robert De Niro  did Good playing the bad guy.<br />He  was  an  unstoppable  menace!
B00005N6KG|5|These are the headphones that came with the original Sony Walkmans in the 80's and they are STILL the best compact headphones.  Great sound, great comfort. Lightweight.  Great bass.  Beats all other headphones and earbuds HANDS DOWN!  And a GREAT PRICE TOO!  I would highly recommend.

B003QTSM4S|3|Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman, and Amy Adams delivered the quality performances you've come to expect from them, and the bleakscape that is South Boston could not have been conveyed better; on the latter front, this was right up there with The Fighter and Mystic River (another Dennis Lehane adaptation).  That wasn't, however, enough to overcome the issues with this move, the main ones being that (a) the Patrick Kenzie/Angie Gennaro partnership became Patrick Kenzie (and Angie Gennaro), (b) Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan had no chemistry whatsoever and (b) Affleck not only doesn't have enough chops to carry this movie, but he was also severely miscast as Patrick Kenzie -- too young, too narrow a range, and a weirdly flat affect (frankly, it would have made more sense for Ben Affleck to play Kenzie and have someone else direct if he couldn't do both -- he's at least the right age and temperament, even if he's not the greatest actor the world has ever known).  It was still okay as a movie, so it gets three stars.  It would have gotten four if the male lead had at least been in the same ballpark as an excellent supporting cast, and five if the director had had a better grasp of what aspects of the novel, other than specific plot points, needed to be transferred to the screen.
B00005JPD0|5|Denzel Washington is his usual excellent self in this suspenseful movie of whether or not he can change the events of the recent past.  Through super-technological advances, Washington is able to view the recent past to try to determine who was responsible for blowing up a ferry.      While viewing the past, Washington begins to get very interesting in a woman that seems to be connected to the bomber.   As he views her in the past, he realizes that he is able to affect what she is doing so he gets the idea that maybe he can go back to the past and prevent the bombing from happening.    The suspense towards the end of the film is unreal.  A top-notch thriller!

1416594884|2|Most Wanted Man is my 3rd Le Carre novel, and it followed a familiar pattern with my previous reads.  I should say, my struggle to finish the book was familiar.  Ironically, I love his writing style.  In each novel, though, I simply had to drag myself through the pages.  I don't need to summarize the story - that's been done enough on these pages - but I will say that unlike my previous two selections, MWM was all over the place - it suffered a distinct lack of focus...  and it was boring.    Le Carre was at the height of his literary power when writing about what he knew firsthand - cold war Realpolitik.  I have to assume that he's out of his element writing about the \\"War on Terror\\".  Or, perhaps his confused portrayal of intelligence agencies as much at war with each other as with an enemy they don't understand - that doesn't play by established Cold War rules; afraid to get it wrong, so just rounding everybody up in the same dragnet regardless of guilt or innocence - is more telling than I credit.    Either way, as a novel it wasn't gripping, it wasn't terribly interesting...  it was hard to keep my eyes open.  I think I'm done with Le Carre.
B00EMJD6TC|1|One of the dumbest movies I've seen in a long time.  Premise is unbelievable. Only reason I give it one star is for special effects.
0738737909|5|The Tarot Illuminati is the creation of Erik C. Dunne, with a companion book by Kim Huggens.  This Tarot is based on the Rider Waite Smith (RWS) Tradition and it depicts the same imagery on the artist unique style.  Paraphrasing from Steele's preface, this deck is not about secret societies, but about the Light of Wisdom shown by the inpired vision of Dunne.  As such, this deck is better serve for Tarot collectors than beginners, since the imagery may be too vibrant and complicated at times.<br /><br />I must admit I was reluctant to buy this deck at first since I have no appetite for gilded decks or another re-imaging of the RWS.  However, a review in youtube picked my interest on this deck.<br /><br />Holding these cards on my own hands is another experience altogether.  Dunne's artistic style is basically a realistic representation of the RWS Tarot using a collage of images merged with a computer software.  However, this description oversimplifies what Dunne has created.  It would be better to describe my experience with these cards as a sensory overload waiting to happen.  The imagery is so vibrant at times; almost overwhelming to the point that I didn't know what to focus on first.  For some of the cards, this effect is too distracting, but for most of them it works on demanding a closer attention to the imagery.<br /><br />The cards in this deck are gilded on the edge.  These are 4.75\\" x 2.75\\", slightly wider than the usual 4.75\\" x 2.5\\" for LoScarabeo, but matching the size of The Rider Tarot from U.S. Games Systems.  These are also thicker (1 3/8\\") than other LoScarabeo decks (1\\").  The images on these cards are edge to edge, with the exception of a 0.25\\" at the bottom for the card's label title. Otherwise, these cards are effectively borderless.  The back of these cards are reversible, showing a golden decorations on a green emerald background.<br /><br />The Tarot Illuminati cards are numbered and labeled at the bottom.  The Major Arcana are numbered with roman numerals starting at 0 with the Fool and labeled on the Rider Waite Smith Tradition with the exception of I. The Alchemist (The Magician) and X. The Wheel (The Wheel of Fortune).<br /><br />In the Minor Arcana, the pips are numbered Ace to 10, while the court cards are labeled Princess, Prince, Queen and King.  Each suite in the Minor Arcana is associated with a world culture: Cups with Venetian/Italian Culture, Pentacles with Oriental Culture, Wands with Perisan/Arabian Culture, Swords with Elizabethan/English Culture.  However, the guidebook associate the Cups with a \\"Fantasy Culture\\".  I disagree.<br /><br />These cards come in a kit. The box is decorated with golden highlights all around on a green emerald background, with The High Priestess on the front.  If you settle the ornate box on its back, it opens like a coffer and closes with a magnetic contact. This kit also includes a guidebook decorated in the same fashion as the box, with The High Priestess on the front and The Prince of Cups on the back.  This book is organized as follows:<br /><br />Foreword -  In the foreword, Pamela Steele tells how she discovered Erik C. Dune's artwork and how the Tarot Illuminati comes to be.<br /><br />Introduction - The introduction is barely three pages long!  It focus on the purpose of the Tarot Illuminati and what is different from the rest.<br /><br />Using The Tarot Illuminati - This section includes four spreads:  The Sun, Moon and Star Spread (3 cards), The Planetary Spread (7 cards), The Lighting the Lantern Spread (6 cards), The Rising Sun Spread (4 cards),<br /><br />How to Learn Tarot - This brief section (four pages long) includes a few hints when using the Tarot including: keeping a journal, daily draw, and interpreting the cards.<br /><br />Major Arcana - Subtitled Emanations of the Light, this section starts with the association of the Major Arcana to the ten planets (With Sun, Moon and Pluto minus Earth) and the twelves sings of the Zodiac. This sectioncontinues with the description of each Major Arcana in two pages including a Title, Subtitle, Brief Associated Story, and Themes & Concepts in a Page and a Color Picture in the following.<br /><br />Minor Arcana - Subtitled Illuminating the Mundane, this section refers only to the Pips in the Minor Arcana.  It starts with the association of the Minor Arcana to the four elements and the numbers. This section continues with the description of each Pip Card in a single page including a Quarter-page Color Picture, Title, Subtitle, Brief Associated Story, and Themes & Concepts.<br /><br />Court Cards - Subtitled Stars on Earth, this section starts with the association of the Court Cards to the four elements. This section continues with the description of each Court Card in a single page including a Quarter-page Color Picture, Title, Subtitle, Brief Associated Story, and Themes & Concepts.<br /><br />Appendix - Subtitled Tarot Illuminati Revealed, includes an excerpt from the e-book \\"Tarot Illuminati Revealed\\" describing The High Priestess in full detail.  It sure make you want to buy the e-book.<br /><br />This deck is a realistic representation of the RWS Tarot, but I wouldn't recommend it for beginners because it may be overwhelming at times.  However, it is indeed an interesting re-imaging of the RWS Tarot, one that Tarot collector must not let pass.continues with the description of each Major Arcana in two pages including a Title, Subtitle, Brief Associated Story, and Themes & Concepts in a Page and a Color Picture in the following.<br /><br />Minor Arcana - Subtitled Illuminating the Mundane, this section refers only to the Pips in the Minor Arcana.

B00FAT9W0A|5|When you get a double cd of hits, new songs, live tracks and b-sides, it makes you think, this is awesome but also sad because if they truly are broken up forever, there will be no more genius music from them again.  And that would really be too bad.  The new songs and the second cd of b-sides and live tracks are stunning!  Not all of them say hit or radio play, but they are beautifully crafted and say something with great emotion and meaning.  I love Keane and will miss them  Please only be broken up for like 2 years!
B0000DJZ8R|5|The movie is a representation of what the struggles some people went through during the Great Depression.
B00KNWYDU8|5|So fun you should get it really I'm not kidding
B0053O89XI|5|The Big Bang Theory is one of the funniest shows on TV!
B0002KPHXS|2|Given what great scores this flick gets in all the databases, I was shocked at how poor INTERMEZZO is.  Sure, Bergman is gorgeous, but that isn't enough to compensate for the trite plotting, two-dimensional characters, and laughable dialogue.  Want a strong romance from 1939? Try DARK VICTORY.  A 1939 pageant? GONE WITH THE WIND.  A 1939 comedy? NINOTCHKA.  1939 Family fare? THE WIZARD OF OZ. 1939 was a fantastic year for movies, so go buy/rent/watch something with a little creativity behind it, and stear clear of this time-waster.
B00006674X|3|Indeed.  I guess you have to look at this movie in this context.  It looks dated, kind of like those really bad TV shows of the late 60s and early 70s.   The dialogue is terrible, laughable at some points - &quot;she was raped, even against her will&quot; - give me a break!<br />Elvis looks good, before he blimped out on cheeseburgers and drugs and Mary Tyler Moore is her usual annoying self - its said they didnt get on - not unsurprisingly.  <br />The supporting cast is not too bad - good to see Ed Asner in an early role.   This is one of Elvis lost films, so to speak, in that if you are not a fan then you would not really know about it.   <br />Worth a look.   The DVD is good quality as is the VHS.   The songs are pretty duff but whats new?<br />It looks like he was trying to get his movie career back on track but was perhaps side tracked by live performances.
B0000009TT|5|Buy it. You will be pleased you did. Enough said. Note the cows markings on the cover are in the shape of Italy. :)
B002KS1IJC|2|I had expected a lot more from this movie, but it let me down. It was boring after the first 30 minutes or so.<br /><br />But then, that's me. I expected a lot more from Prometheus too, but it was too much like Alien(s). Cyborg. Pop out of your gut monsters.
0804137382|5|I truly believe the path of life is full of obstacles and it's only when you manage to clear it out, when you can turn into a better you.

B005V2EVBQ|4|Amazon,      I had purchased the original Kindle for my wife a couple years ago. She has stated that this was one of the best gifts I have ever gotten for her. I thought this year I would get her the Kindle Fire. If the original was great the Fire would be amazing. I was right!   She absolutly loves this thing. Once again I hit a home run with this purchase. So far we haven't had any issues. Great product at a reasonable price.  Thanks  Scott

'nuff said.
B008476HBM|5|Hah!  Another P&P review?  I'm a died in the wool Jane Austen fanatic.  I read all the fan-fic that is published.

B0010358D0|5|Kobayashi did a great job on this movie, as he has done in the past.  Animation is excellent, and although the story is a bit convoluted at times, it shows a more-human side of Deunan Knute that wasn't as apparent in the first of the modern 'Appleseed' films.
B00BSBR9N6|5|Even though somewhat predictable, I liked how it turned out.  Also was enlightening as to thought processes of an autistic mind.
B001NLKT60|5|The girl who played with fire was a great continuation of the sometimes slow moving 1st book \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo\\".  This one moved faster and developed quite the intricate story!  I couldn't wait to start the last one!
B0002ZDVEU|5|I enjoyed the first Jason Bourne movie \\"The Bourne Identity\\".  The sequel \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" continues on the same premise and follows Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) five years later.  Someone is trying to assassinate him at his secluded beach area of India. Now he must find out who is trying to eliminate him. And find out why!<br /><br />Jason Bourne is still uncertain of who he is and where he came from. He is a government trained assassin and slowly regaining his memory. He must get answers from his boss and the top secret government program that put a hit on him. (Trenchmark) Jason Bourne is very intelligent and resourceful of his surroundings.  Corruption is rampant.  Who is going to clean up these loose ends?<br /><br />\\"Supremacy\\" is action packed and filmed with the viewer in mind. This movie is filmed with close up action and cameras everywhere. This movie is a pure suspense thriller that fulfills the bill. Joan Allen (Pamela Landy), Julia Styles (Nicky), Karl Urban (Kirill) and Franka Potente (Marie) are outstanding in their supporting roles.<br /><br />I found out that the Director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday, 2002) deliberately tries to get the viewer in each action scene. Handheld cameras where used a lot and Matt Damon did all of his stunts which makes this film entertaining.<br /><br /> I recommend purchasing this DVD because of the behind the scenes commentary.<br /><br />What I liked the most of the bonus features were the ten minute featurettes of each subject matter. Topics like action fight scenes, Go-mobile (car chases), Explosives and what is it like filming in each country. All of these subjects were commented on by director, actors and producers. Kudos to the producers for filming in the actual city and country of location: Germany, India, Russia, Italy and United States.<br /><br />Most bonus features on DVDs contain one long \\"Making of\\" feature. And you have to weed through some long commentary to find something of interest. Not on this DVD, that's why I recommend purchasing this DVD.on this DVD, that's why I recommend purchasing this DVD. <br />

B003VANOFY|2|BUYERS BEWARE:  The product will most likely be faulty. Your health might even suffer from engaging in extensive research for nonexistent solutions. Although Logitech has fixed some problems regarding the memory leaks and cutoffs through drivers, the product still presents a lackluster sound quality with all the crackling sounds. I am in a great position to say that the 4 and 5 star ratings are premature compliments that preceded the onset of this excessive and unacceptable crackling. I do not blame these reviewers; I would have initially given the g930 a 5 star rating as well. However - after a week - the crackling set in and I was one in a few hundred who have experience the same dissatisfaction. This is my fault for disregarding the power of reviews, overlooking these consumers as recipients faulty products.    If you find yourself experiencing the same problems, please do hesitate in blaming your retailer. Chances are, it is Logitech to blame for not backing up this product with the service it was once reputable for.    One last thing: the 7.1 will make you feel like you are sitting in a cave. The only sounds surrounding the listener are echoes.

I love the figure, it's a good size and the golden army battle was the best part of the movie! The booklet is not really anything, but there's a cool poster inside that makes it something.  And to top it off, I really liked the movie!

B00007JVBI|3|Think Breeders. As in, if you're going to take half a decade (or more) to release a record, it had better be a progression. The first three songs on You Are Free are stunning - as is the almost rocking \\"He War,\\" which could have fit snugly on What Would the Community Think\\" - but midway through, it all starts to sound the same. Chan Marshall steals Leonard Cohen's trick from \\"Joan of Arc\\" (two simultaneous voices - one sings, one talks) and sorta runs it into the ground. An exception to the late-album slump is \\"Names,\\" a touching, simple song about young 'uns acting the fool (selling drugs, having sex, etc). Certainly not a bad record by any means, but not exactly worth the wait, either.

It's a movie about love between two brothers, one is much younger and very successful in life (Charlie Babbitt, played by Tom Cruise) and the other is the autistic older brother (Raymond Babbitt, played by Dustin Hoffman, he got an acadamy award for this one), who is institutionalized. This movie makes me think every time I see it, it's one of those movies that you can watch more than once, rent it and experience the world you may not know exists.<br /><br />Get the Special Edition DVD, if you're wanting to buy this film. The DVD only has three commentaries, one deleted scene and a featurette. Also a few trailers and photo gallery, but MGM could have done much better. For a special edition re-release it still kind of sucks. Nevertheless, you're supposed to enjoy the film.<br /><br />This is a masterpiece of a film, and it should NOT be missed. Rent it, buy it, experience it.
B00G2GMRCU|5|I never expect too much in a short, but this was a pleasant surprise
B004QSQML8|5|Tim Curry as the darkness, awesome 80's flick. This is up there with the Dark Crystal and the Goonies in my book.
B007MB5OCE|5|I can't remember enjoying a book as much as this one in a long time. It was so improbable and fun and great. I loved the old fashioned language and how everything turned out for the best. It was a hoot! It was a book a really enjoyed taking my time with. I loved it.
B00JAC25FM|5|THIS GAME IS ADDICTING
0804162727|5|This book makes me feel like Zelda is homework. Buy this book and beat the game.
B003TSEEDY|5|I really loved this book! What a great read..... I finished the book in about 12 hours and I wasn't ready for the book to end. As you're reading you become attached to these characters and you want to know everything you can about them. I love the relationship that Charlie has with his family and I cried when the relationship change between Charlie and his sister because she really needed him. Simply an amazing story and I hope to read more from Stephen Chbosky.<br />I'll be sure to see this movie.
B004O4K4SQ|3|This game is OK but it suffers from the same problem as many other similar apps, a lack of proper documentation.  Here, we have a wide range of weapon selections but no information on how each weapon behaves.
B00B2V66VS|4|For some reason, this game is highly addicting. I just can't get enough of it. The graphics can be a little bit men here and there, but overall, I like it.
B00715QREA|5|This movie is a classic. Enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.
031606792X|2|Now Twilight has been a guilty pleasure of mine for some time now (even before the movie). I fell in love with Edward and despite the fact that Bella saw no life outside of Edward (anyone else wonder about her life in Phoenix at all?), I was able to love Twilight, New Moon and mostly love Eclipse. Breaking Dawn was one of the biggest disappointments of my reading life. I can accept a Vampire child, in fact it's interesting and there are myths out there about it. I can accept the horrible pregnancy and the Volturi wanting to kill the child. But you have all this tension built up and what does Meyer do? Allow it to fizzle into nothing. There was no fight, no one died, and everyone just lived happily ever after. Horray!    And when Bella and Edward supposedly had sex, I actually turned a few pages back thinking I missed something. Apparently Vampire sex happens so fast that we didn't even get a sentence about it.    Maybe Meyer thought this was a young adult book and there were some things that young adults can't handle. Sex, death, etc. But, I don't think she gave this age group enough credit. These are things that all people deal with.     Also, I'm extremely disappointed that Meyer would allow a leaked portion of Midnight Sun stop her from writing it. I can understand her feeling a violation of privacy and her artists rights but artist make art because they have a vision. I'm sad that she allowed the vision to die because someone was a jerk. I personally didn't read the chapters until she put it on her site and only read it then because I would never get to read the complete novel which is disappointing. Because honestly if I was writing Twilight I would have written it from Edward's prospective in the first place. Bella's life isn't nearly as exciting when Edward is not around.     Anyway, I do recommend the read to a Twilight fan (you need to see how it ends). I'm just sorry the ending was such a cop out.
B003EI2EH2|4|As I get dragged headlong into middle age, my body isn't the body I want to see in the mirror. This book is an invaluable tool to help you make those changes. The slow-carb diet works, people. Try it, you'll like it!
B00DR0PDNE|1|Sucked.
B0087YYHZU|5|movies ever. I am 53 yrs old and believe it or not I had never seen the movie. Oh I've seen the singing in the rain segment all my life but never the whole movie. I have missed a lot by not ever seeing it. The Blu-Ray color is out of this world. The lady in the green dress in the dance scene with Gene Kelly in the latter part of the movie. The green is SO sharp it almost hurt my eyes. I don't know about other versions of the DVD but if you can get the Blu Ray. WOW!!!!!
B000JBWWBK|3|I was disappointed with this soundtrack because it seems to me a lot of the songs are additional--not original to the movie.  I was frustrated when listening to it.
B00FAPF5U0|5|A great past time for me while my husband surfs on the TV.  Have had to find a couple other similar games while waiting for new lives but this is my favorite.
B0000BK6OR|1|would not play
B00BVYNSLC|5|Loooove this show! Sci-fi, suspense, drama...This show has all my favorites and I'm hooked.
B00000DCHD|5|Billy Joel won Grammys for this and I think rightfully so. This is a great album, a sidestep from &quot;The Stranger,&quot; jazzier and lighter. I really like every song on this album. Each one has their own &quot;artistic merit&quot; and before I knew that Joel had won awards for this, I would glance at the CD cover, run through all the tracks in my head and think, &quot;This is a phenomenal group of songs.&quot;<br />&quot;Big Shot&quot; is the rock number and a nice opener (Word on the street is that it was written after a really bad date with Bianca Jagger). &quot;Honesty&quot; is a poignant piece with thought-provoking lyrics. I particularly like the way Billy segueways from the line &quot;'Cause you're the one that I depend upon...&quot; into the chorus, &quot;Honesty is such a lonely word,&quot; without taking a breath. There's another &quot;word-on-the-street&quot; story behind this song regarding Liberty Devitto, Billy Joel's drummer but I'd rather not mention it here. :) If you want to know, email me.<br />&quot;My Life,&quot; the theme from &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot; (that sitcom where Tom Hanks-- yes, *that* Tom Hanks-- dressed like a woman) is catchy and fun and has fabulous &quot;Screw you&quot; lyrics. &quot;Zanzibar&quot; is probably the jazziest of all the numbers and is my least favorite, not because I don't like jazz but because the lyrics are basically about a sports bar and therefore not nearly as &quot;touching&quot; as the ones in &quot;Honesty.&quot; :)<br />&quot;Stiletto&quot; is this dark number that always makes me think of alleys behind bars and the creepy people lurking in them (although that's not what it's about). Very, very good metaphor in the song (I sound like the English major that I am) and very, very effective. &quot;Rosalinda's Eyes&quot; was written sort of about Billy's mother. It's calypso-ish and has a bit of a Latin groove to it. &quot;Half a Mile Away&quot; is probably my favorite piece on here just because I like the uptempo beat and the musical phrasing. &quot;Until the Night&quot; is the &quot;show-stopping&quot; ballad and reminds me a lot of &quot;This Night&quot; from the &quot;Innocent Man&quot; album.<br />&quot;52nd Street&quot; the title track is the shortest one but is a lot of fun and a nice ending. As I said earlier, Billy really deserved the awards that he won for this album. Don't be surprised to hear things here that you don't hear on &quot;Storm Front,&quot; &quot;The Stranger,&quot; or &quot;River of Dreams&quot; though. He took some chances and I think you'll agree that they paid off.
B005544TRQ|5|Cool
B003TSEEDY|5|This book was amazing. It seemed to really pinpoint the emotions that go through a teenagers head in a day to day basis. Plus, it was innovated and creative. The plot and storyline were new and as a result, phenomenal. Truly a great book.
B007FG9LIE|1|Didn't care for it enough to bother finishing it
B000VWJ6D4|5|one of Elton Johns best albums, if not the best
B0058UXHHK|4|I really enjoyed this book even though I got a bit irritated at Rose. She was so innocent and just didn't know how to stand up for herself. But it was good and am anxious to read the others in this series. I just hope Rose gets a bit more &#34;smarts&#34;.
B0000BWVCM|4|Good
0316228532|5|Great book
0385504225|2|I sure hate to have to say this....  I'll keep this short.  This book was not at all what I would expect from Dan Brown.  Way too long.  Lots of rambling.  I can't give anything away, but I can tell you that I would skip this book entirely.  I'm going to pretend I never read it and go back and re-read Angels & Demons.  ; )
B00GXKVZSW|5|this is a good show, watch it.  if you like cerebral crime dramas you will enjoy this show. good show
B000YDG5W0|4|I like that vr light weight but I dont know why its feel like large but like though really .
B00QW8TYWO|5|This is the best game in years. I am even taking the time to write this it is so good. Please get it it is a good use of your time. I love it I have played it for 45 straight minutes.
B0069G5Z9K|5|Great game with cute music and graphics. The crazy upgrades are awesome. The fact that the Game is free makes it a no brainer! Very challenging and rewarding.
B00JGUI66A|4|It is fun. I just started playing it and it is fun. I wish you could move your troops and guide their attacks though.
B00DJFIMW6|3|Idk about other people but for my kindle it won't download. I realy wish I could base this review on the game itself but it won't download so how can I :/
B0053O89KG|5|This is the best show on TV. There is something so fantastic about Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic together. The chemistry and mystery solving make this a must watch.
B0000BWVCM|5|better than the first. one of the best superhero films<br /><br />HIGHLY Recommended<br /><br />If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
B00003CXA6|5|Excellent movie
B000AMJG4Y|5|I saw this movie, unfortunitly with english sub. 'cause it was in Japanese, but it rules! To be honest, the battles are a little bit over the top, you can't blink at all during a battle, but it's freakin sweet!
B00BJS7LHC|3|The show was good. A lot of vulgar language. Shows African Americans as slaves so if these type of shows offends you then this show is not for you.
B00FKF0F3C|5|This finishes the Trilogy. It is a lot of reading but a multitude of history and interesting information. I highly recommend it.
B00F88H5K2|5|This movie was hands down excellent. Within 2 minutes I forgot it was Michael Douglas and he became Liberace. Outstanding performance from both him and Matt Damon. There's no awkwardness at all while they're playing these roles...they just flow as these characters. Great job!
0345533666|5|As with \\"The Round House: A Novel\\" by Louise Erdrich, \\"Defending Jacob\\" by William Landay is not ordinarily a novel that I would select on my own to read. However, it was a selection choice for me as part of LibraryThing's Secret Santa 2014. I am glad that the novel was brought to my attention.<br /><br />Written by a former assistant district attorney before turning to writing novels, there is a particular authenticity that is fundamental to the depth of this novel. I believe to give this book a label (e.g. legal thriller) would also be an injustice to the depth of the experience in reading this work.<br /><br />Perhaps it can all best be explained by the author himself. There is a section in the edition that I read entitled, \\"A Conversation with William Landay.\\" One of the interviewer's questions is \\"Does plot come first for you, or character?\\" The author explains, \\"They come at the same time.\\" He then goes on to share, \\"One of the pitfalls of dividing our books into genre novels versus 'literary' novels is that we have come to expect too little character out of the first and too little plot out of the second, leaving both poorer. A good novel needs both, of course, and the two should be wrapped as tight as the strands in a rope.\\"<br /><br />This novel is without a doubt \\"wrapped as tight as the strands in a rope.\\" It is the best example of a literary novel that I can think of since reading \\"The Orchardist\\" by Amanda Coplin. The novel draws the reader into the lives of one family - Andy, Laurie, and Jacob Barber. The reader will be engrossed into the wide scope of relationships that compose all of their lives from the immediate to extended family relationships, adult friendships, teenage friendships, and dynamics with coworkers to mention a few. The reader will become enmeshed through the emotions as shared steadily through the eyes of the father Andy Barber but not merely as father to Jacob, husband to Laurie, but also as a son, as a man who has an unwavering belief in justice, an wavering love of his child. Within the strands of the rope, within the core of the novel, it presents a question: How far would you go to protect your child? A parent might think they know the answer to this simple question but is it a simple question? How far would you go? It is a dramatic story that is timeless in presentation and I believe will be held as a classic in the years to come.<br /><br />It is a thoughtful composition that sheds light into areas where many of us are not familiar from family meetings with a criminal defense attorney to the stark spotlight of courtroom procedure to the letter of the law* to the periods of waiting between crime to investigation to trial, and the periods of waiting between the close of court session for the day and the continuation of court session on the following day through the course of a trial.<br /><br />This is a book not easily picked up to read by all readers but for those readers that enter between the covers of the hardback or paperback or begin clicking the pages on their eReader (e.g. Kindle, Nook), it is an incomparable, thought-provoking experience.<br /><br />*Definition of \\"Letter of the Law\\" as provided by \\"Black's Law Dictionary Free Online Legal Dictionary\\", 2nd Ed. \\"The strict and exact force of the language used in a statute, as distinguished from the spirit, general purpose, and policy of the statute.\\"
159562015X|4|Overall, I felt like my strengths were spot-on and gave useful information about how to work with others.
B000021Y74|5|&quot;Run Lola Run&quot; moves and moves fast.  It rushes past like a frenzied nightmare, pausing only for a moment between each of its three distinct segments for a romantic interlude that puts the exclamation point  on the rest of the movie.  This is the best foreign example of the new wave  of unconventioanal movies that include the likes of &quot;The Matrix&quot;  and &quot;Go.&quot;  The dubbing is not great, but I can't imagine trying  to keep up with subtitles in a movie like this.  If you like action that is  not insulting to the intelligence, this movie is for you.
B00LLMFAAG|4|If you like the oldies you'll love this album. Don't miss it. Did you like the movie? You have to buy it.
B009ZAY8MM|5|I really love the way these 5 people make such a big sound with their voices. And how innovative they are with their sound. This album doesn't disappoint in either of these respects. I especially like Carol of the Bells but I'm enjoying all the songs.
B00CB4ET0K|4|I use my tablet, for gaming purposes anyways, as a way to deal with boredom while waiting in any kind of line or for an appointment. This game has served that purpose very well. It isn't complicated to learn the controls and the back story, at least for most people, is fairly well known and of interest. I have yet to have to spend any real money while advancing through the stages, although spending real money will expedite the delivery of more weapons, hence firepower, it is not a necessity to really enjoy the game.
1465001123|5|This was a hit! It has some great pictures in it with a good variety. It was a hit with our friends daughter. We got this for her knowing she was the biggest Taylor fan ever (ok ok, your daughter might be too ;)).  She loves it!<br /><br />Good quality. Great detail. Good pictures!
B00DR0PDNE|5|I LOVE THIS DEVICE.  Perfect for mirroring your Android phone.
B00008NRL8|4|This is great Tango dance music. I first heard a cut of it when our ballroom dance teacher used it . It was what I call a techno Tango number titled: Santa Maria(del Buen Ayre). If that doesn't put passion to your Tango as you dance with your partner, then nothing will. I had to have it and have never regretted it. Great music!
B003UYUR10|4|great buy because of iTunes digital copy included. Super excited Ultraviolet was not included.
B0089LOG02|5|What can I say? A lovely, lovely book... brought tears to my eyes several times... a book I would read again & again.
B007FEFLTO|4|A historical novel that expands many years and many families that finally intertwine together.  My kind of book.  Can't wait for the 3rd.
B004A8ZWVK|5|This movie was great!  It really brings you back to a time that we should all be ashamed of.  I can't believe people were treated like that.
B0013D8LCW|5|This is a well done and believable story, showing the protaganist really struggling with who is he is and coming to terms with his attraction to another man.  Good chemistry in the cast.  Worth the bucks.
B00I8H6X58|5|Wow, great performances
B002TWWOHE|5|This is my favorite series. Now I've hooked my sister and niece. Classy, hot scripts (how do the writers do that every week) and not to mention I could watch Matt Bomer all night long.
B00002Z88D|4|i think combining the symphony with some of their songs was a good combo, but id prefer to see metallica live than hear them, it just doesnt sound quite right listening to them without the adrenaline of actually being at the concert. good selection of songs though, pick it up if u like metallicas other stuff. id suggest getting this album last to complete ur collection, get all the other stuff first (except st anger)
0375714669|5|This book should get 10 stars. I loaned it to a professor who teaches middle eastern politics, she promptly gave it to her next semesters class as an assignment. This book is a life changer. Brava Satrapi!
B00I2TW0UO|5|So good
B006X08FDA|5|Great cd, great band
B000FBFN1U|5|I liked this book more than the first two in the series, as it has far more action and things really move at a good pace.
B00HWWUQYY|5|Great Movie
B001HN6940|5|It was a gift. Delivered in a timely manor and very much enjoyed by the recipient. I will use this same method to get movies in the future.
B005K0HDGE|4|The bulk of the book was a great read!  The ending totally fell apart.  It lost the feeling of reality the rest of the book had.  I ended up disappointed.
B0095ZMMCK|5|Taken right out of current headlines.  Scary look at the not too distant future.  Cyber terrorism has already happened and we are likely in for more.
B00AW57L96|3|A good read
B00F9F1G4U|5|I use this app on all my devices. The good thing about it is that it connects to a speed test site on my ISP network that is only two hops away. This gives me the ability to easily measure the performance from my location back to the ISP. I can also choose other server locations to simulate network traffic from my location to practically anywhere else.
B005PW3OS8|5|Amazing
B00B7Y0206|5|You tube for tablet
B0067Q42BY|5|Fun, easy to see tiles and easy to follow directions.  A colorful display makes things easier to see.  A great game!
B00EPG591K|5|My husband loves this.  He uses it every night; although, at night I feel like I am being drawn to the time in this attractive blue.  The alarm works fine and there are no slip-ups, etc.  We still haven't experimented with the full extent of the app.
B0025KVLU6|5|A classic, a break out album that defines al' 4 Beatles seeking their own direction toward independence. Some songs are odd as in Number 9 but it was classic Beatle experimental looping and quad tracking. George Martin has less of his fingerprints on this LP than any other. By the time The White Album was released, the Beatles were all doing their bit independently and Harrison broke the cardinal rule by bringing non-Beatle Eric Clapton in for &#34;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&#34;, a cornerstone tune of remarkable material. It is a pity that Helter Skelter found it's way into Manson's brain especially since HS is a childhood playground game.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|It is one of the best games i have played its worth it :) ;)<br />If you play minecraft you will love this
B00L9B7IKE|2|I found it too weird and depressing. I like uplifting stories.
B0089LOG02|4|Enjoyed the book.  Interesting topic and a good story.
0312305060|3|THE HOURS was a little hard to follow and at times I had to reread some of the passages to see if I had missed some key point.  There are three central characters and each chapter is about one of the three women.  Virginia Woolf was by far the most intriguing of the characters and of course she was a real person. I didn't find the other two women to be sympathetic as people. Clarissa Vaughn seemed to be living in the past and Laura Brown was a woman who didn't want to face real life and lived in a world of the books that she read. I was constantly trying to find the link between the main characters, and of course some things are finally revealed at the end of the story.<br />Since THE HOURS was based on Virginia Woolf's book, MRS. DALLOWAY I really wish that I had read that story first. Michael Cunningham has written a very unique and original book, but I have to admit that I didn't like the story and thought it was rather depressing. I don't think that I'll see the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5|Holds your interest.  Easy reading...good plot.  Seems to follow along with the movie quite closely.  Looking forward to reading the next book in the series
B0000AGQ6Y|5|This version of The Professional is wonderful. It tells the story as it should have been told in its original U.S. release.     I'll never understand why the American public are treated like stupid little morons while the rest of the world enjoys great theatrical art.
B00AF6MF9I|1|After the update I cannot go to faction or battle anyone. Please fix this.<br />It was a very fun game until the update.
B003DS9ECQ|5|Enjoying it
B004R13U6Y|4|This app is fantastic for reading PDFs. It pauses appropriately, and clearly reads and pronounces the words, even complex ones. It does this very well.<br /><br />A few drawbacks: You can only start it at the beginning of the page. A problem if your PDF has tables and lists. Would like to see this fixed in a revision..<br /><br />Another setback is the editing/mark-up features. Each time you want to mark up it wants to create a new mark-up document. You can draw lines and boxes and place notes, but you can't highlight, which is what I want. So I have to use a different app to do the mark-ups. These are minor tweaks that could be extremely useful.<br /><br />However, as a reading app, it's a great tool to own. Well worth the few dollars.
B0002F7I9Y|5|I lost my original and wanted to replace it, because it's one of my favorite albums to give myself over to.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Unique storyline and amazing &#34;characters&#34; that keep you guessing and wanting more episodes! Can't wait for season 3 to come to Prime!?
0142410705|4|Bought as a requested gift for a grandaughter
B000063DI8|2|Sensing the band had gone much too far towards a &quot;progressive&quot; direction, Steve Harris decided to go back to a raw sound. Ok. Adrian Smith left the band before recording began.<br />His replacement was one of those mysterious choices that will make you guess forever... Janick Gers. A guy who simply can't play a guitar solo with the same skill as Dave Murray, Adrian Smith or dozens of other British guitarrists (check the &quot;butchering&quot; that Janick does when playing Adrian's solos, live. Unbeliavable. He spends so much time jumping and kneeling and spinning that he simply don't play them!)<br />Anyway, NO PRAYER has a raw sound. So far so good, but there was no necessity to use such a lousy production, with a garage sound, adn stupid songs like HOLY SMOKE and BRING YOUR DAUGHTER. There are some gems here (HOOKS IN YOU still has Adrian on the credits), and TAILGUNNER. But even the great songs were ruined by the weak production and some of them by bad soloing.
B00AREIAI8|5|I down loaded this App for my  grand-daughter, she is 9 years old and loves playing it. It is one of her favorite games.
B009UX2YAC|5|You run and jump and it is for kids. It is not like temple run (which I gave4 out of 5 stars) it is kidish. You can get this game for free to
B00005JPNZ|3|Not bad love the action, shia lebouf (love him)but at times thought it drag on in the middle because i kind of fell asleep in the middle of the movie as well as my husband. so i would actually rate this 3.75 STARS. not BAD just not PERFECT still watchable and enjoyable. DON'T GET ME WRONG the action was great as well.
B008Y7N7JW|4|This is one of those books that are hard to put down once started.  I am a regimented reader, in that I usually read while in bed, prior to going to sleep....however, I have lost sleep while reading this one.  I have the set and am looking forward to the next two books.
B00KA87GCW|5|Simple and easy game to play a fun diversion from more serious games. Would recommend this to one and all. I am looking for more things to say about this game
B009UX2YAC|5|Its really a great game I love to play it and my brothers and sisters like to play it to and I think its really cool
B00004ZB9D|5|It's the Lenny Kravitz you know you love. It's the Greatest Hits, after all. If you're looking at this CD. Buy it. Just do it.
B009LGO88E|4|a must for certain games like MGS and KH , easy installation and very comfortable control. the only complains are the high price and added bulk spc for the already bulky 3DS XL!!
1400034205|5|An old favorite from one of the great authors of the English language - Mr. Maugham ostensibly is writing about Larry - who comes very close to being a saint - but in fact, he is revealing how poorly others react to such perfection. - especially the two women in his life - lovely, sophisticated Isobel, and broken, pathetic Sophie - Larry's intentions toward both are honorable, but neither reacts well to them. This is elegant prose, the work of a master craftsman
B00AYE8C70|5|Fantastic app!  Lots of great emoticons for text msgs.  Can't wait to see how well it works when I travel!!!
B00LU0XO3O|5|Super fast and accurate scanning.<br /><br />The tray for loading slides is a little small for some with thick cardboard borders.<br /><br />I was able to load and scan at least 10 slides per minute.<br /><br />22MP scans create rather big files.<br /><br />Printed files are beautiful as the original.
B004LFO0ME|5|Not like your usual Wiz Khalifa mixtape. But not in a bad way. This album has a different feel to it. A different sound and experimentation. Which means there's something for almost everyone on it. I've been listening to it for a month now. Love it. Bought two copies- one for now, one for later. :-)
B00HY7VU60|5|The Queen kept my interest from season 1 episode through season 10.
B002VECM4A|5|This movie is unbelievable. Monique's performance is worth the Oscar she got for it. I made my daughter watch it because I needed her to see what some people go through including her own mother. Sometimes you cant find the words and movies (and books) will say it for you.
B0094BB4TW|1|Almost immediately after opening the app, I'm forced to wait or close because it is no longer responding. Waiting always results in being asked the same question. Kindle app for Facebook is not fun to use at all anymore.
B0091REZMW|5|Very addicting, however you go through energy and diamonds way to fast. Also trying to get and accept friends and gifts is very confusing and frustrating. But I do love the game.
B00D6BQG1W|4|This movie was fun and unique as well as creative in light if the zombie craze. Don't expect to be wowed by effects or convinced in anyway this would be possible, but it's cute and has some hilarious moments and one liners.
031606792X|2|I loved the twilight books, once i pick one up i can't put it down, but i was deeply disapointed in this book. This book makes it seem like marrying at 18, missing college, having children and giving up everything up seem like the perfect idea, and remember that she is still only a teen. I also thought that her attachment 2 edward was disturbing and innapropriate. And annoyingly enough, most of the first part wasa bout edward and bella having sex. This does not exactly send a positive message out to younger readers. you hva e to remember that 10 YEAR OLDS READ THIS BOOOK!!!! all in all i was very disapointed by the message this book sent, and all in al disapointed with the book.
0782008364|5|This was an excellent movie with an actual storyline that didn't center around sex or sexuality. I felt comfortable watching this with my straight friends (who suprisingly enjoyed it without complaining) Bound is a movie I have no problem popping in on a rainy day.
B00IS87HYI|2|Wellllllllllllllllll..... it's ok but not fun nor addictive I mean I gave it 2 stars to be nice my review is all you do is press the darn blocks it's not ok for younger children either unless they are supervised because so many tabs on Facebook one day a kid is gonna click it and it can add a virus to your kindle it happened to me now notifications have adds that I can't get rid of I love my kindle adds not so much or kids might want free &quot;coins&quot; or whatever but with most apps what you want is this<br /><br />GRAPHICS: b-<br /><br />FUN: c-<br /><br />ADS: f<br /><br />I mean come on addictive not at all disappointed not fun wish it was as good as candy crush still loving king apps not this one DISAPPOINTED :( :( :( :( :( :( :(
1451627297|5|Incredible, hard-to-put-down book. It's not a horror story in the typical \\"Stephen King\\" sense, but it is incredibly haunting and really well written. Highly recommend.

B004ODLUGM|4|My wife told me this was originally a book, which I've never read, but I liked the story.  Good background music as well.  My daughters like it and ask to watch it again randomly.  Has some minor scary moments for younger kids but it isn't anything really dramatic, just more of the &#34;what-if&#34; fear than actual scariness.  I would recommend this as short movie for kids to enjoy.
B009361C5O|2|Don't like
B00AW0KGYI|5|I absolutely loved this movie with the added footage. I wanted to get every bit of it!  Great job!  Look forward to more!
B000003S5H|3|I definitely don't understand.  There are many, MANY wizened, sophisticated techno music fans who love to sneer in superior fashion when confronted with dance music that in any way, shape, or form can be judged  &quot;cheezy.&quot;  Yet a lot of these same self-styled cutting-edge  sophisticates just melt at the very mention of the French duo, Air.  This  cd is &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;mellow,&quot; but definitely reeks of  pop/schlock/sentimentalism. &quot;Kelly Watch the Stars?&quot;  Are you  kidding? Where's the great appeal?  This stuff is cotton candy for the ears  and mind, but little more.  Go to the chillout room and enjoy, folks.
B001O8KRW8|5|love this cd
B006MW3UZW|5|I am really enjoying this series! I stumbled across it while browsing with my new Amazon Prime package. There aren't too many decent programs on tv- (it's one of the reasons I don't watch regular tv). I enjoy watching the character development and seeing the war (and numerous other current events) from the British perspective. GREAT SHOW!
0802130208|5|I had a great time reading this book. I love the (more or less!) exaggerated characters (all of whom reminded me of real people), and the author's take on human nature. It surprises me that some people,few though they are, don't find humor in it; I think it wouldn't surprise Toole, though! They could have been characters in a future book had he lived. RIP, JKT.
B00BD99JMW|1|I read the first 2 books multiple times and was very excited for the third book. I read Divergent and Insurgent both in less than 2 days each. This book I had to force myself to read it over several weeks, and with this book 1 time was plenty, I have no desire to ever read this book again. This book tarnished the first 2 books too, and I loved them both.<br /><br />The entire story line is ridiculous, there are all these new characters, really no development of the existing characters. There are new serums introduced in this book. The entire storyline is stupid, there was so much that could have been done once the characters got outside the fence but instead we got the dumbest storyline. The book is written from both Tris and Tobias' perspectives, which was confusing and the first 2 books were from Tris' perspective so it baffled me why this book needed to be from Tobias' perspective too, toward the end it made sense but I just hated it, plus once the main character is killed off why keep dragging the story out, she's dead what more is there to drag out for 10 more chapters? Plus I hated the chapters that were like a couple paragraphs long... why bother?<br /><br />I hated the end of the book, killing off 2 of the best characters and turning the other main character into a marshmallow, a sniffling cry-baby with mommy and daddy issues. Horrible. I felt like Veronica Roth wrote this one out of contractual obligations, this book had no passion or thought put in it at all.<br /><br />I wish memory serum really existed, I would drink it to erase this \\"book\\" from my memory.  I feel like the story I loved was spoiled with this third book. Too bad there isn't a 0 stars rating, even 1 star is too many for this book.
B000002I4S|5|This is another example of how great a saxophonist John Coltrane was. He created a new chord progression that had never been heard before. It was a long journey; even in Coltrane's early playing as a sideman, you could hear that he was trying to take the music to another level. He needed to be free, and he needed changes that challenged himself technically and took the listeners to another level. That was achieved with \\"Giant Steps.\\"  <br /> <br />Today, this is still the standard that every jazz saxophonist has to live up to. Getting to the level that one can actually attempt Giant Steps takes years of practice, and then to fully master the chord changes takes lots more practice. It won't happen in a day or a week.  <br /> <br />No one will be able to do it the way Coltrane did. He practiced 16 hours a day. He continued to take his music to another level and another level, year after year, album after album and never stopped until the day he died. There will never be another Trane. Saxophonists will come and go, but Coltrane set the standard. Everytime I listen back to a Coltrane album I am reminded about his greatness, his humble artistry, and his great work ethic.
B001M5UDGS|5|Like many other people, I saw this for free when they released it online. However, after watching it I immediately went and bought it, because they deserve my money for making such a great movie. The movie alone was worth the money, so the awesome musical commentary was just a bonus for me. One thing to note though: this dvd is a burned disc with a label on it.Seriously, if you look closely, you can see that it says \\"Verbatim 8x dvd-r\\" under the label, and it has the same purple bottom as most burnable dvd-r's, instead of the usual silver bottom of pressed discs. I personally didn't care, but I figured this might be something potential buyers may want to know. It's still worth every penny, in my opinion.
B006E4QCXU|5|A fantastic way to kill time.  The physics are really cool.  You can change colors and change from repel to attract from where your finger or fingers are.
B001BR7CZW|5|A Classic! We never tire of watching.
B00QW8TYWO|4|Once I got to have half of the characters I almost never got new ones. Other than that I loved the game and so does my 3 year old brother. I recommend this game for all ages.
B00DQ845EA|4|This is one of my favorite business/entrepreneurship books! Ben Horowitz discusses his experiences as a newbie CEO for startup Loudcloud and what he learned in that role. He provides lots of advice about how to do the job well which I found very encouraging as a wannabe entrepreneur. I would recommend even non-entrepreneurs to check it out because much of the advice he provides is about how to build a stellar organization. I feel this advice is very applicable to any ambitious person in the organization who is trying to effect change.
B000QRIGLC|5|This is a must read for any American. This will make you appreciate the freedom that we have and be grateful for the men and women who fight to keep our freedom. God bless America

B009UX2YAC|5|Awesome so addicting
B00CATSONE|5|I was astounded at the genius of this man. The greed of the monied rich was also almost unbelievable.  Thomas Edison's trickery was something I had never heard about and was really surprised.
B000KKPN5C|5|Nice compact flash - simple to use
B009HNDCC4|4|I love this series.  It's not quite as good as the first season, but I still enjoy watching it.  Entertaining.

B005T87QCI|1|First. The install is 339mb after installing then the app does a download. First thing when i opened the app an ad popped up. Then before i could make a selection another ad popped upthat i could not get rid of. Instant uninstall.<br /> -5 stars

B00B5P37IG|1|I can't get anything on this app. Doesn't give me anything to watch. Doesn't work and can't see anything..I'll probably delete it.
B003UYUQZW|5|My whole family really enjoys this movie. It's clean and filled with action and adventure - and besides, it's a Steven Spielberg like 'National Treasure' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. You just know it's going to be epic.
B007ZGO7EM|5|good, easy to use and readable.  easy, simple, words can no longer describe it.  what can you say about it.  I t is what it is.
B008Y2FRFO|5|Fun for all without violence, darts or swear words<br /><br />You can buy upgrades but you do not have to<br /><br />Play daily and enjoy
B0000AQS0F|5|We loved every minute of this series and we could not believe it got cancelled.  If it had got the advertising it deserved it could have been great!  Hopefully they will continue the series...scifi has picked up the rights and hopefully they will continue to make these.  It is a western sci fi with the feel of star wars and and old western.  Fun and entertaining.
B00FR0GT9Y|1|After being more thoroughly disappointed by each Boston album that was released after Don't Look Back and my jaw hitting the floor with how horrible Corporate America was I knew better than to buy this. I checked it out from the library and that was a waste of taxpayer money. I don't know how to put it any better than the other 96 1 star reviews that like me wanted to give it 0 stars, Tom Shultz you MUST STOP! You have tarnished a once great bands place in rock history by continuing to put out worse music with each album until this one which has me convinced there actually has to be something wrong with your thinking if you can honestly release this and go out in public. You re-did 3 of your own songs from your last horrible album to put on this? Doesn't that tell you how done you are Tom? There was only one good song on your last album, 'Someone'. You have managed to re-do it and wreck it with your effort. Tom you have completely lost your mojo. One of the great secrets to life is to know when to quit. It is a secret you have yet to realize. Please stop making music Shultz, you have truly lost it. If this is what a celery diet does to a person please serve me up a steak.
B00E7Z7D2M|5|Honestly, I recently just discovered Mr. Glasper's work within the last year or so. I am truly impressed. I went back and purchased most of his albums. This is a great followup to &#34;Black Radio&#34; and Black Radio EP. Keep up the great work!!
B0000214F0|4|I wish I could give the movie 5 stars, but the audio and technical aspects are lacking. Imagine a director filming his vision with full love scenes, gore and unedited story. This movie is unique and should be supported  (bought) as you would support (buy) any other example of art&quot;. My only  concern is ...don't watch the movie too many times, you'll end up like  Caligula yourself.
B007Q1VUFA|5|Enjoyed it tremendously.  It came quickly and I listen to it often.  Reminds me of 70's dead.  Looks like Phil Lesh rubbed of on Chris...
0792165020|5|I don't know how anyone couldn't adore this beautiful movie. Filmed in gorgeous Italy with Jude Law, Gwynneth Paltrow, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. It is fast fun and you will not be bored.

B0015D3Z4O|1|I never thought I'd say this, but this is the worst dance album I've ever heard in years and, unfortunately, it was released by Madonna.<br /><br />From start to finish, the album is just awlful.  The lyrics are lame and the production is just so empty for a dance album.  This is the first thing I've ever listened to by this TImberland (I'm more into rock now vs. pop/dance since most of it has been total garbage since the late 90's)--if this is the type of junk that is on the radio, then I can see why the music industry is suffering and major labels are crumbling!!<br /><br />TImberland's beats are so outdated--it's as if he went to a yard sale, picked up some forgotten disco LPs and mixed them up behind the now DELERIOUS Madonna-who has either ran out of steam to put out quality material or, out of desperation to be \\"hip\\" with the kids, made an album with this fool along with duets with Justin Timberlake (which, though is the only good song on the cd--but the good version is found on the remix single-the album version is so boring, it becomes and LONG 4 minutes) and this Kayne West person.<br /><br />I though COnfessions of the Dance Floor was bad, but this is just junk.  I kept skimming thru the cd to find a diamond in the rough, but came up short handed.<br /><br />This HARD CANDY is hard to swallow and stale.  Madonna, go back to working with the producers that did Ray of Light and American Life and do things YOUR WAY and stop trying to follow trends to act young--Don't let yourself become the fallen leader of Dance Music!
0446580945|4|Having the ability to write a captivating love story in modern-day language is something Nicholas Sparks has perfected.  The way he uses words to bring a story to life is one of a kind; Sparks writes with emotion and empathy while dealing with subjects that change peoples lives.   In Dear John, the story is told of a soldier who fought for and found honor and glory on the front lines of his heart.  Told as a heart-breaking first person narrative, this story isn't ornamental or embroidered; it's a simple story that cuts to the heart of the reader.        Sparks sets the stage for his tale by beginning the book with the main character, John Tyree, telling us about his long lost love, Savannah, and the relationship they once shared.  John presents the question to the reader of what love really is and then answers it according to what Savannah would have said it was; living happily with one another while accomplishing the simple dreams that every girl has of having a home and a family.  John goes on to say that \\"happily ever after\\" isn't always the answer; love calls for a greater surrender and sacrifice.  John and Savannah meet at the beach while John is home in North Carolina on leave from the Army, which has him stationed in Germany.  Savannah is a college student spending the summer building homes with Habitat for Humanity.  In the two weeks they spend together, they fall in love and agree to marry one another once he comes home from Germany 16 months later.  John and Savannah correspond through letters during these long 16 months and the reader sees their relationship peak and fall throughout.  Their marriage plan seems to be executing itself perfectly, but then September 11, 2001 happens, and John decides to re-inlist, which crushes Savannah.  The difficulty of a long-distance relationship puts a huge and constant strain on their relationship, causing them both to make some hard decisions.           Not only do John and Savannah share a very special relationshipthoroughout the book, but John and his father do as well.  John's relationship with his father had thinned because of John's frustration with his father's incapability to love or to talk about anything other than his collection of coins.  The relationship is one of challenges and complexities, but there are glimpses throughout the book where the reader can see the father loving the son, but he is unable to communicate it to John.  Savannah comes along and provides John with insight into his father's behavior that John had never been introduced to; the idea of Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form of Autism.  As John continues to learn more about this condition, he comes to an understanding that allows him to re-establish a loving relationship with his father.          A compelling and best-selling author, Nicholas Sparks definitely knows how to capture his audience.  By telling a  very clear-cut story, the narrorator brings the reader close; he never lies to the reader, but neither does he ever tell too much.  Years after the events in the book take place, the narrorator is telling his story through a window of his own grief and remembrance.  This personal touch helps the reader to really value the passionate relationship between John and Savannah and helps him/her understand they both had the desire to make it work, but he/she knows all along that it ends in heartbreak.  One of the things that the reader wonders throughout the whole book is how this almost-fairytale like relationship could dissolve, and it leaves one consistently praying that something will happen or someone will intervene to change the outcome of heartbreak and loss seen in the prolouge of the book.     Not only is the story itself enchanting, but so are its characters.  In this particular book, the characters stand out because the energy they create makes the reader want to keep reading; Sparks' produced characters that are easily related to because they are typical people who face the same challenges and temptations that real people face on a daily basis.  When looking at the people that the characters portray, they are not pompous or haughty; they are characters who are ethical and honorable; they stand up for what they believe in, even if they're standing alone.  It was refreshing to read a novel where the characters had tenderness in their behavior and they held firm to what they valued.         Throughout the book, the themes portrayed are what carry the account from good to great.  The main theme of the book deals with the question of whether love is something that is purely sought out of selfish ambition or whether it is something that is cherished, prized, and valued, even if it ends with a broken heart.  Sparks' key message which stands out through this question is that, though tough and very intricate, the love shared between two people changes them forever.  For John, loving Savannah meant more than a fairytale; it meant sacrifice no matter the cost.  This message is one that speaks to contemporary culture today because it reminds us that love, when not sought out of selfish ambition, really is unstoppable.
B00000IPAX|5|1 OF THE BEST C.D.'S I HAVE.IF POSSIBLE I WOULD GIVE IT 6 STARS.SO GO OUT AND BUY THIS.
B000NQR7NO|5|The Arctic Monkeys not only surpass their fantastic debut, but they make it sound effortless. If any doubt remained, this stunning album blows it away. These guys are the real deal.
B0036EH3TS|4|I love this movie and I wanted it on bluray. But its not as sharp as my other blurays. It still much clearer than your regular dvd.
B001MSMULG|4|It was well written and had interesting characters, but the plot wasn't that exciting. I never felt it was a edge of your seat page turner although it was an enjoyable read. I read it on the recommendation of a co-worker. Still not sure if I'll give Silva another shot with the next book in the series. Probably read another author first than maybe come back. I give it four stars because i thought it was well written, otherwise I would have given 2 1/2 to 3 stars. Judge for yourself. Cheers!
0312370849|3|I enjoyed Sarah's story much more that Julia's.  A bit predictable toward the end.  I would have just enjoyed a novel about Sarah's life.  The history was so much more complex and much more interesting to read ....
B00IS87HYI|1|They cloned a game for more money not a good buisness tactic
B000JK8OYU|4|I bought this as a gift for my husband.  I don't think he has listened to it as yet but I placed the order one day and within approximately 4 days received my item.

B000C20VPA|5|\\"Casino\\" is a crowning achievment on alot of different levels.  The directing, the acting and the story.  You feel so involved while viewing it, you get so tangled up in all the crap that ends up happening.  It's an emotional investment worth the payoff.  All of the performances are brilliant, especially the scenes between Sharon Stone and Robert De Niro.  There was some funky energy between the 2, like they really hated eachother at times.  They're fights and tirades seemed so real, I was mezmorized while watching them.  When Sharon Stone finally gets confronted in the Italian restaurant, and Robert DeNiro graps her and she mutters, \\"I wouldn't do that if I were you\\", I felt the raw emotion of her performance.  This role was Sharon's crowning achievemnt in film in my oppinion.  This is one of my favourite films, I wish someone could make another epic drama like this again, there seems to be a shortage of good stuff like this around.  ENERGY PEOPLE!
B00R143VHC|5|Love Star Trek TNG
B00129H7VS|5|Great movie!
0345803507|5|These books are musts, especially for the ladies.  If you don't own them, you should.  Start with the first and read all of them - I haven't come across anyone who was disappointed.
1451666179|5|I love her, love the way her mind works, can't get enough of her stories and her descriptions.  This is worth it.  I do wish they'd published the book on paper that's an inch wider than it is.  It's so thick that you really have to press it flat just to read the words that are near the binding.
B008IJTFYW|5|I tried relax melodies and I went to sleep easily. This is a really good app. If you have trouble sleeping than this is the app for you.
B005MLOKXA|5|Love love this show!!
B005UDD1R6|3|It is a great concept but pretty glitchy for me.  Not all of my files ended up where<br />I wanted them and found it a waste of time hunting them. Down
B00EEDJHXA|5|This is just an all around enjoyable game. I particularly like that it has no IAPs...I get so tired of those in every other game that's out there. It's nice that it doesn't tax your brain too much, and requires some strategy but still gets harder as it progresses. I'm still in the 5x5s and am anxious to move onto the next stage. I think that anyone questioning whether or not to get this game should jump on it. I promise you won't be sorry!
B000002JEV|2|I am a 15 year old and just discovering Led Zeppelin.  The first music of  theirs' I purchased was the three cd remasters set.  I loved it and still  do, but I was curious to know how they sounded live.  It's completely  different and I don't like it at all.  Stairway to Heaven is my favorite  song and this version butchered it!  There are certain types of music that  sound a lot better live, but Led is not among them.  Stick to studio  albums.  I can see how more hardcore fans might enjoy this, but it's not  for me.
B000XV6VOK|5|I *am* a history buff (historical writer, researcher) and I honestly did not think I'd enjoy 'The Tudors' at all. For one thing, it's a period that doesn't really interest me and for another, Henry VIII is fairly well known in terms of the history of the Kings and Queens of Britain.<br /><br />I was completely blown away by how much I *did* enjoy it. It made the history very real and very accessible to modern audiences in terms of pacing, plot and narrative structure; the dialogue was a good mix of historical anachronism and modern; the costumes were to die for (god, I want Anne's red gown!); the characters were engaging; it was easy to quickly become deeply invested in the show and the story of the history.<br /><br />It's not 'pure' history by any standards, but it's certainly got enough scandal, plotting, sex and pretty in it to satisfy just about anyone with even a mild interest in history and Henry's life.
B0000C9V3T|5|JUST HERE TO SAY THAT TRACK NUKBER 6 (ODE TO ORSEN ISHII - BY RZA) IS A RIP OFF SONG AND IS ALMOST THE EXACT BEAT AS TEN TOES TALL - BY LIL WYTE ON HIS ALBUM &quot;DOUBT ME NOW&quot; - THE SONG BY LIL WYTE IS BETTER TOO THAN RZA'S VERSION
B0017U7PT6|2|...Because surely this couldn't be Earth we're talking about.<br /><br />As far as the BD is concerned, it looks and sounds great.  As far as the movie itself:<br /><br />If someone had access to a huge budget and modern CGI techniques back in the 1980s 10,000 B.C. would be the result.  Trust me, I wasn't expecting anything of Oscar caliber, but congratulations on making a movie that makes marginally more sense than Bestmaster or Clash of the Titans (no offense to either classic film).  BTW, note to Director Roland Emmerich: Your own movie Stargate and Mel Gibson's Apacalypto called and they want their respective plots back!!!  Also William Wallace and General Maximus are pissed!  If brainless fantasy masquerading as historical fiction is your cup of tea, look no further.<br /><br />And man o man;  I took a peak at some of the few special features on this disk.  Are the director and that writer/historian Graham really serious in that short documentary about there inspiration(s) for coming up with this preposterous story?  I guess so.
B009O2XY12|3|Easy game, would be a great game for kids. Even young children could get this game. Easy to pass the time away
B005IQZB14|4|A long walk with some insight, some agony, and some interesting characters along the PCT.
B00BWQW73E|5|This was a fascinating insight to an unknown world to me.  I would recommend this book to college business majors, and to close friends ( however those closest to me have been listening to my reading favorite passages and are probably ready to get even with me by quoting lines from a Michael Connelly mystery.
B00068TJM6|5|I purchased one of those about 10 years ago. It worked flawless until I had a bike accident and the watch got pretty banged up. I didn't even have to think about it: I just bought the exact same model again. I used to spend quite a bit of money for different models and changed watches quite a bit. This SEIKO changed that bad habit of mine.<br /><br />I used to have a Breitling that spend more time in the repair shop than at my wrist. This watch is pretty much maintenance free and looks just as good as the one that cost over 20 times as much :)
B00XTZPXPA|5|A remarkable presentation of an intriguing, ingenious, and disturbed pioneers of the early 20th century.
B00HGJ18C2|4|Lot of fun
B001E75QGG|5|i've always been a fan of the indy movies. this one just reels me in more, period! 5 Stars
B00GR9TZG8|5|my grandkids loved this movie, just as my daughter did. It brought back memories of seeing it at the show.
B00F87ZUYG|5|this season has been so good Im not ready for it to end. needs to air 5 days a week.
B00COGZ8FU|4|Tom Cruise has a rather stoic role in this movie. But, considering he is ex-military it is an apt role. The movie has a plot and is worth watching.
B005LJK3AC|4|i watched this movie and i think it is funny, i will watch it again with my sister. this movie is not for young persons
B0000026J6|4|I love Leonard Cohen, always have, always will.  No one can put me in a darker mood, of lift me to higher hights than the great man.  And this album is good, at points it is very good, songs like 'Tower of Song' and  'Take this waltz' are haughting in their profound beauty, and with other  gems like 'First we take Manhatten' and 'There aint no cure' I would  recommend this album to anyone.  <br />One note of caution is 'Jazz police' it  seems a confused song, out of place on this album.  It is very Cohen, but  it breaks up the flow of the album.  but lets face it, whats one song in an  album such as this.  buy it &amp; enjoy it
B00COGY2P2|3|We laughed all the way through it.
B00JP5ONY0|5|Had five funny scenes. So five stars for funny scenes
B004MC8CA2|5|I really like this app. I can either read along or just listen to it. I listen to it mostly at night in my bed. I can find scriptures too.
B007PT1PEY|5|I wanted to add this to my personal library, and it's perfect. I know I'll enjoy reading the books again.
B00KF7VWBO|5|5 stars!
B004XJRQUQ|5|Held my interest throughout all three books and I'm a sci-fi fan!<br />I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a lot of action.

B00EUGYM04|4|This album has all of Seether's best hits.  Some I had even forgotten about.  It is two full CDs, a good mix of rock and ballads.  A definite must-have for any rock fan.
B000092ZYX|5|after hearing about half the songs from *ahem* bootleg mp3s, i expected this album to be good but it really exceeded my expectations when i finally bought it a few days after it came out. Its a really great listen all the way through and while it does borrow a lot from OK computer and Amnesiac, the overall mood of this album is a lot different than any radiohead album before it. it is much darker than ok computer even and seems to focus on corruption and the hopeless state that the members of the band perceive the world to be in. the whole album sounds like a journey through a dark forest with gnarled trees, which is an idea illustrated in previous liner notes art and their video for \\"there there\\", but finally they give this idea a musical score. heres a breakdown of all the songs:<br />\\"2+2=5\\" is a great song to start this album out with. The spooky harmony and dark guitar parts really set the tone for the rest of the album, and about a minute and a half through the song they just throw down and rock the place<br />\\"sit down, stand up\\" is a song that really surprised me the first time i heard it because its something that radiohead has really never done before but sounds like something theyve been meaning to do for a while. this song finally blows up in a crazy techno beat at the end.<br />\\"sail to the moon\\" is GREAT. imagine that the best parts of paranoid subterranian android and pyramid song were somehow spliced into one great song. if that gets you excited, check this album out.<br />\\"backdrifts\\" sounds a lot like something off of amnesiac, sort of a disjointed sounded electronic sound with pretty oscillating synths in the background and a funky beat.<br />\\"Go to sleep\\" is an important song because it is a sudden change to something very upbeat and guitar driven. not one of the best songs though, and not anything terribly original.<br />\\"Where I end and You Begin\\": I think this may become one of my favorite songs on this album after a while. Everytime i hear this song i get kind of excited and turn the volume up. It has haunting effects and is a sad song but a great rock song at the same time<br />\\"We Suck Young Blood\\" Ooh, man this is what this album is all about i think. VERY dark and moving, but the best part is when they go nuts about 3 minutes in.<br />\\"The Gloaming\\" shows you once again where theyre progressing to from amnesiac. Very dark again, but has a similar electronic beat to songs in amnesiac and best of all, a crazy bass that will blow out your woofers.<br />\\"There There\\" is my favorite song on this album right now, and i think its a great choice for a single even though the radio edit isnt nearly as powerful as the one on the album. Starts out with a beat that sounds familiar somehow but is totally original, and just keeps moving and pulling you in until it reaches an awesome climax you can feel coming from the get go<br />\\"I will\\" sounded REALLY familiar, like something off of amnesiac or maybe OK computer somehow. maybe thats just evidence that its a great song because it sounds so natural<br />\\"A Punchup at a wedding\\" is a really complex arrangement of pianos and singing with a groovy bass and a nice beat. Im kind of disappointed it doesnt change up more but its still a good song<br />Hearing \\"Myxamatosis\\" reminded me of the first time I heard Idioteque for the first time. I was a little bit confused but i could tell I had just witnessed something of real genius and i just couldnt quite appreciate it completely. So i was intrigued and listened to it more and sure enough, its awesome. I really like the breaks<br />\\"Scatterbrain\\" is just a good solid, beautiful haunting song that calms things down a bit after myxamatosis and reestablishes the more common theme in this album<br />Ive noticed that the last songs on radiohead albums are almost always really strange and/or surprising. Sometimes they can be the best songs on the whole album by far like on pablo honey, sometimes they just make the whole album more confusing like the jazzy glass house song at the end of amnesiac. I couldn't imagine a better ending to this album than \\"a wolf at the door\\" though, because its like a few rays of hope finally come through and you think for a second, despite the still haunting feeling you get, that maybe the storm is over.
B00BMT9SQA|4|Not a regular fan of Barbara S. but I like light films while exercising. This movie was super cute and funny. She was adorable. Great chemistry between her and Seth and a very enjoyable story.
B00DQZQPNM|5|It fits perfectly and protects my kindle fire hd all around when closed.  It does fold out to help &#34;stand it&#34; so I can watch videos.
B00EODU3H4|5|I originally wrote a review for the original Princess Mononoke DVD over 14 years ago. My, how time flies! I've kept the old review below for nostalgia, but since I recently got the Japanese Blu-Ray release of this film, I wanted to give an update.<br /><br />Blu-ray is definitely the way to see this fantastic movie.  If you're considering importing this blu-ray, I'm going to already assume you are in love with the movie and/or have already seen it, but if you haven't there are tons of other reviews to describe the film, suffice it to say I recommend it.  Also, I wanted to reconfirm that YES this blu-ray will work with a US blu-ray player.  It is a Region Free (0) disc so it will work in any region, but FYI, even if it was Region A it would still work in a US blu-ray player since both Japan and the United States are in Region A.  HOWEVER, it is NTSC (the video format used in the US, Japan, etc.) -- so if you have a PAL player (like those in Europe), it probably won't work even though its region free.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />The Japanese packaging puts Disney's to shame.  It's very minimalist, just the title and little kodama character on the front, but I love the austere aesthetic.  Very simple and to the point, and it matches well with the other Japanese blu-ray releases.  Made from metal presumably, the case is surprisingly heavy for its size, and cool to the touch.  It opens up like a book, and contains a little pamphlet in the left compartment that probably includes details about the disc in Japanese, but also includes full-color illustrations of movie posters for the movie. Very classy presentation.<br /><br />VIDEO QUALITY:<br />The same quality and care that's been given to all of the other Ghibli blu-ray releases has extended to Princess Mononoke as well.  Unlike Ghibli's other movies, the landscapes have such rich details that it really adds to the experience to watch this in blu-ray.  This movie was really meant to be remastered into HD.  1080p blu-ray really does this movie justice.  The colors are stunningly bold.  You can see all of the line-work and details.  Since this movie was traditionally animated, it brings the animation alive. It is LEAPS AND BOUNDS better than the DVD release.<br /><br />For a specific example: see the scene where the demon boar attacks the village and battles Ashitaka at the beginning of the film.  In the DVD version, there is an INTENSE amount of blocking and pixelation when rendering the &#34;tentacles&#34; on the boar squirming so fast, but in blu-ray the scene is perfect without any issues.<br /><br />AUDIO/SUBTITLE QUALITY:<br />I've only seen the movie in Japanese with English subtitles and English, so I can't speak to the other tracks (although I've tried each of them out for kicks in a scene or two just to see how the languages compare).  For a list of all the tracks, see the specs section below.  Both English and Japanese have gotten an upgrade - English from 2.0 to 5.1 Dolby Digital (still lossy), and Japanese from Dolby Digital 5.1 to DTS HD 5.1 (lossless audio).  The Japanese track is clear and crisp, as perfect as you can get.  The accompanying English subtitles are very well translated.  The English audio track (the old 1997 theatrical dub with Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian Anderson, and others) is also clearly improved, but not as crisp as the Japanese track.  I was really happy with both, although I always have a soft spot for the English dub since its how I was introduced to the film even though it admittedly has corny performances.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br />This release also includes a lovely 20 minute documentary entitled &#34;Princess Mononoke in USA&#34; subbed in English which chronicles the stateside promotion of the film.  It was a really interesting piece to watch.  However, there wasn't really anything else of interest in the extras.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ It's the only blu-ray option available for US fans at the moment (and Disney will likely be holding back on releasing it in the US until AT LEAST 2015 -- probably even later).<br />+ The video quality is amazing.<br />+ Enjoyable mini-documentary in the extras.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- It's extremely expensive compared to US blu-rays. However: the Japanese MSRP prices for blu-rays are typically higher than the US for all blu-rays (the MSRP price for this is about $65).  Import shipping times might be another con, but I've seen sellers offer Prime shipping so you can really get this in as little as 1-2 days like American DVDs/Blu-Rays.<br />- It's a little light on the extras.<br /><br />SPECS:<br />Since the description field is pretty sparse for this item, below are the actual specs for this blu-ray.<br />Catalog No: VWBS-1490<br />JAN/ISBN: 4959241749796<br />TV Standard: NTSC<br />Blu-Ray Region: 0 (All Region / Region Free)<br />Aspect Ratio: 16:9<br />Running Time: 133 minutes<br />Blu-Ray Release Date: Dec 4, 2013<br /><br />Audio Tracks: Japanese DTS HD 5.1ch, Japanese Linear PCM 2ch Stereo, English Dolby Digital 5.1ch, Cantonese Dolby Digital 2.0ch Surround, Mandarin Dolby Digital 2.0ch Surround, Korean Dolby Digital 2ch Stereo, French Dolby Digital 5.1ch, German Dolby Digital 2.0ch Surround, Finnish Dolby Digital 5.1ch, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1ch, Italian Dolby Digital 5.1ch, Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1ch<br /><br />Subtitle Tracks: Japanese, English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean, French, German<br /><br />Extras: Storyboards picture-in-picture mode with the film, Voice-over Script in Japanese, &#34;Princess Mononoke in USA&#34; documentary (20 minutes - Japanese audio, English subtitles), Japanese Trailers/TV Spots<br /><br />---------------------------------------<br />OLD REVIEW<br />---------------------------------------<br />February 16, 2000<br />&#34;One of the best movies I had ever seen.&#34;<br /><br />I, being not an &#34;anime&#34; fan, was very critical of this movie when I heard of it.  &#34;Anime?  From Japan?  Demon-boar gods?  Take it away, please.&#34;  Once, I went to go see it (to laugh about how stupid  it was afterward) and was blown away.  The graphics were superb and the  plot endearing.  I love this movie and hate all other anime movies.  Compared to any anime movie I had ever seen, including Mulan, this was a  giant of its kind.  The lush landscapes were enchanting and the Great  Forest enrapturing.  What was really good though was the plot.  This was no  &#34;Kiki's Delivery Service&#34; or &#34;Pokemon&#34; movie!  It was a  riviting tale about a young man's journey to remove a curse.  Now, I  haven't seen the Japanese version (I was told that it loses some of its  beauty from Japanese to English), but if it is anything like I saw, it must  have been very good as well.  I especially liked the Kodama, little  people who hop around and click their heads (sounds strange, doesn't it?),  and Moro, the wise Wolf-goddess and somewhat mother to San, or Princess  Mononoke.  I don't know where they got the vice cast for this thing, but  someone had to have been promoted!  Billy Bob Thorton, Jada Pinkett Smith,  Clair Danes, Gillian Anderson, and Minnie Driver were just a few stars from  it!  My favorite character of all though, was Moro whose wise and  intelligent black eyes seem to come alive in the movie.  The pure passion  of this character can make anyone respect her.<br />  I hope this movie  comes to DVD and video soon, because I want to show my still skeptical  friends how good this movie really is.

B003TSEEDY|5|This was an extremely amazing book. Charlie was an emotional and believable character. Going through the reviews, I noticed some of the lower ratings talked about how innocent Charlie is. Contrary to popular belief, not all teenagers are pornhub.com addicts and read smut. So there you go. If you choose to read this book (which I hope you do), enjoy.
B0075MFS9Y|5|Originally posted at Nose in a Book.<br /><br />I know, I'm back with another CD review that isn't the new Mumford and Sons, miracles happen! This album, by the Lumineers, is in my top three albums of the year (the other two being this one and this one.) I am almost too much in love with this album and this band. I can read to this album, I can do homework to this album, I can bawl my eyes out to this album, all of which is a good sign.<br /><br />I have that addicting type of personality. If I read one book in a series, I have to read the whole series. If I fall in love with an author, I must read their complete collection. I told you, addicting personality. I wish I was joking when I say that for the last two years my favorite song has been \\"Little Lion Man\\" by Mumford and Sons. No, it has never wavered. That has been my favorite song to the point of being a joke among by friends including Tina and Lauren. But this album, is giving Mumford and Sons and \\"Little Lion Man\\" a run for their money.<br /><br />This album is full of slow songs, but full of heart. A whole lot of heart. The band is a trio who you can tell love what they do. There isn't a single song on this album that I have a need to skip. Which is hard for me because as much as I have an addicting personality I also have this need to skip through CDs. One of my top three CDs of 2012, I skip through. I know, the shock!<br /><br />Led by Wesley Schultz on guitar and lead vocals, the Lumineers album make it feel like they are able to read your soul and sing straight to it. Wesley is backed by Jeremiah Fraites on percussion, drums, and the like and Neyla Pekarek on cello. But this band isn't Wesley's show with two back up artists, this is a true trio. They all get along, they all have fun with each other and one can hear that on the album. It doesn't matter if it is a slower song like \\"Charlie Boy\\" or a upbeat happy song like \\"Ho Hey\\" you can feel that they love singing and playing together, which makes the album even better to listen to. Plus, I had a chance to meet them recently and they all three are super nice and excited people, which to me is important, because if an artist is mean in an interview or to a fan it is harder for me to really enjoy their music. But don't get me wrong, if they were horrible, I'd still be addicted to this album.<br /><br />I'm thrilled that this album is one of my top three of the year. And no, I won't tell you the order. No matter how often you ask. But really, you should give them a shot, you know how hard it is for me to recommend music. That's more panic inducing to me then recommending books. You can stop laughing now.lbum even better to listen to.

B00992CF6W|5|A perfect game with limited resources for survival mode and infinite everything f or creative mode.This isn't a bad game and the price can be expensive sometimes but it's worth it any way. Please like so I can make a video if possible.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is so awesome. It's a time passer and it's great for kids. My favorite thing about this game is that if you die you have a chance to try again as long as you have enough keys
B00L9B7IKE|5|Very good.
B00005QZ7U|5|If you are a Star Wars fan, you know Ewan McGregor as the straight-aced \\"Obey Wan Kanobi,\\" with the beard and the weird robe.<br />THIS IS A WHOLE NEW LOOK!  Man, the guy can sing, like nothing I've ever heard before.  It took my breathe away.  And to top it off you have some great supporting actors and actresses.  In this movie you will see Nicole Kidman belting out some tunes, also.<br />Nicole Kidman is a \\"courtesan\\" aka prostitute in a different time, different era and Ewan is a writer who wants her to star in his play \\"Spectacular-Spectacular.\\"  And the songs they sing are incredible, you here a whole new take on many songs you have heard before, you here \\"Roxanne,\\" you know the song by The Police, but of course, you know what \\"Roxanne\\" is about.  And to top it off, it is wonderfully romantic movie that shows that love shines through at all costs.<br />If you are a romantic like me, and love movies that express themselves, and love music and a little silliness along the way, the movie is not only worth seeing, but worth buying!
B004J4WLB4|4|Overall I loved the book.  At times the main character was so frustrating, it was angering, but it was worth finishing the book.
B008AU7F3C|5|What a great artist.  I have enjoyed all of Bat For Lashes material I could get my hands and and this new album does not dissapoint.  Continues to be a wonderful sonic earfull with excellent lyrics and wow what a voice!
0446677450|1|The book spends a lot of time lecturing, scolding, and making often cold-hearted barbs at anyone who doesn't do as the authors say....which isn't hard since the authors don't really say anything at all. <br />The book's entire useful information could be summarized in one sentence: \\"find high-return, tax-free investment opportunities and use them.\\" HOW to do that (the main reason people buy investment books in the first place) is a subject almost completely ignored. Whenever concrete investment examples are given, they are inevitably prefaced with a \\"don't do what we did\\" disclaimer - which makes one wonder just what the point is.<br />On and on the authors go about \\"attitude\\", openly praising tax shelters for the wealthy, jeering at the low-paid as \\"deserving what they get\\", scoffing at the value of education and learning - all the while failing to provide the reader with any practical suggestions. \\"Take risks, stay away from credit card debt\\" - most readers already know this.<br />It's telling that the authors, who have little regard for formal education, praise spam e-mails and cassette courses advertised on late-night infomercials as providing useful financial information. And why shouldn't they? This book is the kind of thing advertised in an infomercial - long on claims, short on material.<br />Perhaps the silliest thing the authors say that full-service brokers provide better returns than discount brokers, something that any experienced investor knows to be false. There's no need to spend money on Morgan Stanley's high commissions - and no need to spend money on this book.

B00II3A5TM|1|Worst movie with the best cast.
B000007T1M|5|An instant classic. The best SOAD album and the heaviest. Every song is original and the album flows so well. A definite headbanger. One of the best metal albums of all time by one of the most original alternative metal bands of all time.
1567184855|2|Started out as an interesting read. I thought when I ordered it it would be the kind of book that you can't put down but I found myself losing interest in many chapters. It took me about 2 weeks to read most of it and even then I never finished it. And I didn't believe any of it.
B004Y1WCDE|1|I am not able to access it<br />I did every thing, registered, confirmed etc<br />When you go to fire tv it does not recognize .i entered it several times but it did not respond
B005FISBTO|5|I bought this set for my husband.  He LOVES to watch Dexter!!  The item arrived quickly and made a GREAT Christmas present!!  :)
B000B5MI3Q|5|I have this one's father from the 80's that has done hundreds of dives (never fully trusted a bendomatic-always timed dive even with a computer) and been my main watch for years. Never been serviced or altered at all except for me experimenting with different bands over the years. Shows its age.<br />The new one is nearly identical to the old one except the new has day and date and also, by tweaking the stem, I can set time to the second. The new cost a little less than the old did and seems to keep time just as well. Has been in the shower, rain, and hot tub so far. Bezel operates as it should, hands and numbers glow brightly, and seems to be about 3 secs per day off with the atomic clock. I can live with that.
B00NQKWA6S|5|This is a great collection of music and talent!
B009UX2YAC|5|This is the best game I have ever played in my entire life!  I am not kidding.  I could  not get off of it for weeks.  If you haven't already got this app, get it because it is only going to get better and better.
0783117523|5|If you are an Angelina Jolie fan, this may already be your all-time favorite AJ performance.  If you are not an AJ fan yet, you will be after  you see this amazing true story drama of Gia Marie Carangi.  Gia grew up in  Philadelphia, her parents had seperated when she was young which had left  her looking for real love the rest of her life.  She later met Wilhemina  Cooper who became her modeling agent, and Gia's life took off from there.   Gia also meets the woman of her dreams, and their romance throughout the  movie was breathless and also slightly tear-jerking.  Aside Angelina's  powerful performance, she was well supported with great co-stars including  Elizabeth Mitchell who played &quot;Linda&quot; Gia's love.  It is a  Romance that can never be forgotten.  -This is a must see movie.
B00266W04K|4|The movie was good but the Amazon streaming was very poor. It stopped playing and went back to a place 10min into the movie 5 times as we watched , very frustrating.

B00MB6IYHW|5|Bestmovie Ive seen in a while. Funny, sarcastic, sad, endearing . Just loved it. Great cast too!!
B000QRIGLC|5|An intense depiction of what the human mind and body has to deal with in combat situations.  A frank look at the elite training required in order to over come the obstacles of war.
1570429596|2|I got this book from my local library after reading a Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Gordon Malkiel, a book that makes a point of backing its logical statements with explanations and in some cases statistics.  Rich Dad in stark contrast is written almost like a self-help manual giving generic advise along the lines of \\"don't work for others, work for your self\\"; embedded in cheesy and unbelievable stories about his upbringing in Hawaii with two dads, his real one, a conservative teacher and his spiritual one, a successful entrepreneur.  Kiyosaki does not deny that 4 out 5 new business will go broke within the first 5 years and of those that survive, 4 out of 5 will eventually fail, but he nevertheless insists on pushing the concept of independence, to free oneself from the \\"rat race\\".  To accomplish this, he offers nothing better that the tired and old business model of buying real estate (preferably in foreclosure) with little down and a lot of leverage and selling it (often the very same day) for profits of 20-50%.  This is a lie and a sure way to get you to loose everything you worked hard to save in the first place.  Sure, it might have worked for him, but it is by no means a cookie cutter model, especially in these times of the sub-prime mortgage fiasco.  To top things off, this book is badly written, and often the same idea is repeated in almost the same language a few pages down the chapter.  If you want to be \\"inspired\\" with a baseless sense that you too can be rich, go for it. If you want to really learn how to think about investing, there are many better books than this.  Thank god I could simply return this copy to the library and did not spend any money on it.
B00FI7XBIS|5|I saw this on sale so just figured I'd try it out and it turns out that it's actually a pretty fun game. Worth trying I would say
B00DUGCLY4|5|This game is super fun
B005LAIHR2|5|awesome!  if you loved the rock music of the 80's (big hair) you will love this movie
B00005JMJ4|1|As worded by amazon, \\"How do you rate this DVD?\\" . . I have to give the DVD one star.  I review the MOVIE further down, giving it four stars.<br />About the widescreen verison DVD . . . <br />Universal Studio Home Video managed to taint viewing experience before a frame of the movie was ever played.  This DVD leads off with movie previews that can NOT be skipped, nor can you jump to the main menu while the previews are playing.  You can only fast forward.  This is the only DVD I've ever purchased that forces you to sit through their advertisement.  It is infuriating that I am force-fed this spiel watching a DVD (that I purchased - studio can do what it wants with rental versions)while in my living room.  <br />The studios finally do something consumer-friendly (or is it just a strategy to combat pirated copies?) by releasing DVDs with sub-twenty-dollar prices and then take one step backwards by doing something as annoying as this.  <br />About the Movie . . .<br />Chances are if you consider buying this movie, you have an idea what the plot is.  I give the movie a four star rating.  The most impressive element of the movie is how it succeeds in conveying Bob Harris' (Bill Murray) and Charlotte's (Scarlett Johanson) feeling of isolation in a foreign land.  Their relationship is seeded by this mutual alientation and the viewer follows along as they draw strength from each other to make their stay bearable.  The two are in very different stages in their lives and it seems their relationship is one of convenience based on being stuck in Japan, but we learn they have much in common.  Both are at crossroads in the marriage and careers.  <BR>The movie could have gone the easy route and become a \\"Man-with-midlife-crisis-has-fling-with-younger-woman,\\" cliche, but challenges the audience to follow two people who make a connection and slowly (and sometimes awkwardly) build a relationship.<BR>Bill Murray is completely believable as a broken-down actor in Japan to make a commercial.  Scarlett Johansson is great as Charlotte.  A lesser performance and the character would have been reduced to the stereotype.  <br />In short:  A good movie.   An annoyingly packaged DVD by Universal Home Video.
B009CPES4I|5|When I first saw the previews for this movie, it immediately drew me in I was captivated by the colorful all star cast and the plotline of several different characters and how they are brought together by fate to a hotel in India with each carrying with them their own emotional baggage. There are love stories of many different types with the Hotel owner Sonny pulling it all together while trying to deal with his own personal life both family and fiance. The most refreshing part is that there is little nudity leaving more to the imagination as of movies of a bygone era. Yet, it is never boring leaving the watcher hungry for the sequel like a good novel does. I am sure I will add this movie to my collection as with the Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.
B000UD0ESA|5|the forerunner of the (unfortunate) slew of futuristic sci-fi films.  This is the classic.
B002YCVX5S|5|This movie is classic Tarentino, and this is reflected in it's cleverly conceived plot, interesting dialogue and an extremely dark sense if humor. The entire cast is at it's best, and the direction is sublime. It is a film that will make you laugh, and then question your own laughter. It is definitely one of the best films of the last decade.
B00701L5XS|3|The app really comes off as an impressive one with the 3D and 360* rotation but reading all of the scary reviews about privacy;  and other trash embedded in the app, I will regretfully be forced to delete it.

B008JFUR10|5|I really really like this movie. I see a lot of reviews complaining about the story is weak. Well folks this is a Kaiju film (Godzilla, Mothra, etc.). The Monsters and Destruction is what makes Kaiju's movies not Oscar winning dialogue. If you lames want a great story stick with Forest Gump or Sleepless in Seattle. For the people who want BIG MONSTERS and MASSIVE DESTRUCTION this is the movie for you. Highly recommended!!!!!

B00LZXOI5E|4|I can really enjoy this.
B0047VSW30|4|A completely enjoyable movie that transported me back to a period of ancient history I knew nothing about.  It follows the life of a Greek philosopher, astronomer and mathematican named Hypatia played extremely well by Rachel Weisz.  The story takes place in the city of Alexandria in Egypt and has a great deal to do with the emergence of Christianity and the Christians persecution of the pagan religions.  From what I’ve read by people who know more than I do about the 4th century A.D., the movie is a bit heavy handed when it comes to the Christians, who appear more like modern day Taliban, and it seems the Library of Alexandria and lighthouse were already destroyed.  As I was ignorant of those facts, I found Hypatia’s story interesting and the depiction of Alexandria quite fascinating.  I don't know if the director of the film had an agenda to put down Christianity and don't care if he did.  If he was making the point that fundamentalist religions, both Muslim and Christian, have a bad habit of treating women like second class citizens and persecuting them when they threaten the supremacy of men, it's a point well worth making.

B00062IDCO|5|I have finally completed watching the Star Trek Voyager series. I was purchasing one season a month for the last seven months and it is my opinion that this is the best of the Star Trek franchise. As for season seven...it was the best of all seven and I highly recommend this entire series to Star Trek fans and Sci-fans alike. It is great entertainment!
B000FQ4M58|5|Any Meatloaf and Jim Steinman fan should have this to complete their Bat Out of Hell trilogy.<br /><br />The CD is a mix of mostly new material with a few recycled songs from previous Jim Steinman albums.  Fans will recognize &#34;Bad For Good&#34; from Steinman's debut album from the same name.  Die hard Steinman fans will know &#34;The Future Ain't What It Used To Be&#34; and &#34;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&#34; from the album; Pandora's Box -- a Steinman creation from the 80's.  The original &#34;It's All Coming Back...&#34; is still the best version, at least in my opinion.  Although, I do prefer Meatloaf's duet version on Bat III over Celene Dion's remake.<br /><br />I don't think Bat III is as good as the the second release, and certainly not as good as the original.  But Meatloaf fans will still like hearing him belt out a good song.
B00EEDJHXA|5|Very fun. Simple game play but not boring. Try it.
B006LSZECO|1|I had to stop reading this novel because, after reading a good portion of the book, it just seemed to be going nowhere.  Back and forth in its timeline turned into what I thought was a big waist of my time.
B0030V0PEW|4|The book is fascinating and it dives deep into surgery issues and how to solve them with a checklist.  The problem I have with the book is that it really doesn't tell you how to design or build a checklist.

B000ETQRCM|5|While some are hailing this as the return of pearl jam the fan's of the band know that they never left and have been putting out great music even after '94. It must also be said that this is the band's best work since their masterful album \\"No Code\\".  <br /> <br />The thing that's different on this release than the band's last couple of release's is that this one doesn't have any filler. Every song is great. Cannot say that about too many albums I own. It rocks hard and also caresses gently. From the the fast rocker \\"comatose\\" to \\"come back\\", pj really found a good balance on this album. Here's my song by song review:  <br /> <br />Life Wasted, great lyrics and rocking music. Definitely a good opener.  <br /> <br />World Wide Suicide, while I'm sure most have heard this one on the radio already it is still one of the best on the album. Great lyrics from eddie.  <br /> <br />Comatose, the opening makes you immediately think of \\"the who\\", one of the best rockers pj has made since the Vs. album. I wouldn't be suprised to see this one make it to radio, especially with it clocking in at just over two minutes.  <br /> <br />Severed Hand, tell's the story of a man going to a shaman for an out of this world experience. Excellent lyrics and the album keeps in form with another rocker. One of the best on the album for sure. One of the best pj songs ever for that matter. <br /> <br />Marker in The Sand, reminds me of \\"betterman\\". I don't think anyone could complain about that. A great catchy chorus hear and also strong verse lryics. Some of the best eddie has written in a while. Sounds somewhat of a prayer..\\"God, what do you say? I'm calling out! What do you say?\\". Great lyrics from ed here. <br /> <br />Parachutes, this one will catch you off guard. If comatose is the who rocker then this is the beatles love song. Something different from the band at it works really well.  <br /> <br />Unemployable, lyrics that I'm sure most people that work for a living can relate to. The only song I really can't get into on the album but it's far from bad.  <br /> <br />Big Wave, I'll admit I didn't like this song at first but it's kinda cool after a couple of listen's. Lyrics are decent and music is average.  <br /> <br />Gone, starts of dark sounding and just explodes into a big chorus. The best song off of this album in my opinion. Great lyrics and the music matches them perfectly. Reminds me of \\"In Hiding\\" with the soaring vocals. Two thumbs up on this one. <br /> <br />Life Wasted Reprise, 53 seconds long. I think it would have worked well as a prelude..maybe the album opener. Pretty good for being so short. Just repeats the chorus from it's namesake song.  <br /> <br />Army Reserve, awesome lyrics and a big chorus. Definitely have to sing along to this one. Another masterful song. \\" <br /> <br />Come Back, wow. This song is awesome. Bluesy and soulful. One of ed's best vocal performances in quite sometime. Once again proves that pearl jam can do a heck of a lot more than just big stadium rockers. Not quite as good as yellow ledbetter but has the same bluesy feel to it. Going to be great in concert for sure. A little long on the album though. <br /> <br />Inside Job, slow build up into a great song. Written by mike mccready and I must say he did a great job. It kind of reminds me of \\"immortality\\" the way it starts out quiet and just builds into a huge sound. A great album closer.  <br /> <br />I don't see this album as putting pearl jam back on the map (that they never left) but more of an album that proves they have been making great music all along if people would only stop and listen.  Buy this album. <br />

B001R60ESE|4|From a quality point of view, both video and audio are 5 stars as many have stated. As for the diverse lineup of artists, I think that pretty much depends on how eclectic your tastes are. I personally didn't have any problems with Steve Tyler and Yo Yo Ma being on the same stage. But that's just me. You would have to listen for yourself.    I had 2 issues - one of which led me to give it 4 instead of 5 stars. The performance of the Ennio Morricone piece from Cinema Paradiso is both captivating and intense. Yet in the middle of one of his solo, inexplicably Chris winks at someone in the audience. This just ruined the whole piece for me. (juxtapose this with the comment he made at the end regarding needing a drink...) This is one of my favorite all time piece but because of this, I will only listen to this piece on CD. This is a case where listening is truly better than seeing.    The other issue was with the disc itself. The initial disc I received was defective in that the \\"special feature\\" wouldn't play back properly. Amazon promptly shipped a replacement which worked fine; typical kind of A+ service from Amazon

B00FAPF5U0|5|And then I was introduced to CCS.  When I downloaded it, I played it only when my 3 year old daughter napped.  A few days ago, I looked up from the game, and she was asking for my car keys so she could go to work.  Whaaaaa??  There's moss growing on my legs and I'm pretty sure I need a good shower or decontamination bath.  Oh, and I checked my bank account, and I now owe the bank over $15K from paying for bonus moves, color bombs, and striped candies.  Whoops.  Looks like my house will just have to be repossessed.  Maybe the homeless shelter has wi-fi.
044661758X|5|Great read
B006LSZECO|3|Any suggestions about the plotline of this story would give it away - and the plot is what makes this read-worthy. It is well-written and an interesting look at couplehood. The idea of having the two main ,,characters write alternating chapters is a good one... I'm just not sure about where it heads and the ending. But I was caught up in the story, for sure.
B00B0X4PIO|2|I could not wait to get my hands on this book. I went straight to the book store because I could not wait on Amazon to deliver. Boy was I disappointed. The book starts with a wonderful narrative about childhood love between siblings but a quarter way into the book it all went downhill with the introduction of tangential characters whose development did not develop the main narrative of the story in any way. I kept reading hoping it would get better and hoping for a resolution  which never came. I wish I could get back the hours of my life I wasted reading this novel.
B00G5G7K7O|5|Awesome. Kids can watch this movies over and over. Good story. Animation excellent and the voices are beautiful. Would recommend it.
B002ECEJ3G|5|I bought this book as a gift, and the recipient said the book arrived in perfect condition.  It also shipped quickly.  My friend has never read Woolf before, and as a former English teacher I thought it would be a good first novel to try.  I love this book!
B00JBGSHSQ|4|Let's say they took quite a few liberties with this movie, including placing a stowaway on the Ark.  It could have been a lot shorter and made its point much sooner, but then it wouldn't have been Hollywood.  It is completely understandable why it failed at the box office.  But if you're into biblical history (Old Testament in this case) and a vengeful God to be feared, it made for an interesting watch.  It needed Russell Crowe to keep it all together, though.  The movie indeed had a message, only you have to wait to the very end to hear it. I wouldn't recommend rushing out to purchase it, but if you're in the mood for something slightly thought provoking, give a shot!

0838577016|5|I am a Female Reconstructive Surgeon who while reading a diversified field of topics have fallen very fond of a particular work.  This is Principles of Neural Science.  having just completed the 2000 edition I can guarrantee that the new edition due June 2006 will be even more captivatiing.  If you have the opportunity to see Dr Kandel speak please do he is an academic historian who gives a broad history of each critical piece of medical history to each of his topics.  But returning to  his epic, Principles of Neural Science is akin to Newtons Principia in that is a sublime masterpiece.  The Kandell prose is colorful, smooth and insightful for medical science.  I have  found it easy to read 100-200 pages a day so that the 1400 page book took only a week to discover.  The illustrations are the best for any field of Medicine and I have read alll the classics- Harrisions & Cecils Medicine and Schwartz and Sabistons General Surgery neither of these books elucidates the subjugate field with this type of clarity and instructional prose.  Do as I have done and preorder the new edition.  Those with any interest in the brain will certainly be amazed at the easy depth of information you will achieve.  Believe me  I am writing a book -Female Reconstructive Surgery and I will be implementing operative 17.2 million pixel photography to achieve the splendid vision the Kandel has produced with his illustrations.  I have learned so much on how a book for Surgeons should be written from this Nobel Laureate

0930289234|5|Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen cements forever the important role comics play in the field of literature. But having said that, Watchmen is much more. It is like reading a great book, watching a great movie, and studying great illustration all at once. To say it is the best comic ever written is missing the point: it is the ESSENTIAL comic. It is about why comics even exist, the purpose of their existence, and how that reflects upon our society - hell, on our world.<br />The only trouble with Watchmen is, Alan Moore set such an impossibly high standard for himself, he could never live up to it again, as richly satisfying as almost all of his work is. Everything following Watchmen is just icing on the cake.

0792163710|5|Fifty years after its first release, SHANE remains one of the most highly regarded Westerns of all time.  At worst, people seem to regard it as one of the better Westerns, and many regard it as the very best.<br />If you don't like or enjoy ritual in a film--and many Westerns are extremely ritualistic (Sergio Leone took this to extreme levels in his spaghetti Westerns)--you won't like SHANE.  The entire film is structured around a host of rites and rituals that structure the relations of all the characters in the film.  Some of the rituals are a tad heavy-handed, like the scene in which Shane and Joe Starrett dig up the tree trunk in the yard.  More effective are the rituals of survival that have become an indelible mode of existence for Shane and Jack Wilson.  One of the great joys of the movie is watching Shane negotiate his physical surroundings, the intense awareness he evidences at every second of everything around him.  Rituals and games are closely related to one another, and the movie as a whole is a vast game between the farmers and the rangers.<br />As a whole, this is a first rate cast, with Alan Ladd handing in the finest performance of his career.  Was there ever a more despicable villain in a Western than Jack Palance's Jack Wilson?  (Trivia:  Palance actually could not ride a horse at the time he made this film.  Notice the various work-arounds during the course of the film, including his walking into town leading his horse, walking along in front of it, done because Palance looked so awkward in the saddle.)  The supporting cast is deep and rich, and many of the performers turn in memorable performances, in particular Elisha Cook Jr. as Stonewall.  Brandon De Wilde as Joey, the young boy who idolizes Shane, and through whose eyes the entire movies unfolds (in the novel, Joey is the narrator), manages one of the most likable performances by a young kid ever.<br />SHANE was filmed in Teton National Park, well before it was developed to the extent that it is today, and the exterior shots are as glorious as any film ever made.  If anything, the mountains are so magnificent that they actually detract from the story.<br />My only real complaint with the movie is that it isn't as good as the novel.  I am not a huge fan of Western novels.  Apart from the novel by Jack Schaefer and a couple of books by Larry McMurtry, the only Western novels I really like are those by A. B. Guthrie, who interestingly wrote the screenplay based on Schaefer's novel.  Very, very few movies are ever as good as the novel upon which they are based.  In particular, the great gunfight at the end is simply not as good as the novel.  Still, a great movie, with many, many things to love and admire in it.t is today, and the exterior shots are as glorious as any film ever made.

B00158K0S8|5|I saw the theatrical version when the movie was first released.<br />As a fresh college grad, I could only appreciate that it was an epic<br />and found the film episodic and wasn't the war movie that I expected.<br /><br />I just finished watching the blue-ray version of the film after 40 years.<br />It is also one of the best produced blue-ray disc I've seen.<br /><br />I found this film one of the greatest war epic, with excellent writing<br />(by Coppola), acting (by G.C.

B00005JKG9|5|...in which Kevin Spacey wrings more meaning out of the words \\"Will you go to lunch!\\" then one would think possible. The modern day Death of A Salesman, and after this, no-one will mourn his passing. A Chicago office of seedy real-estate salesmen hustling worthless Florida swampland to the  weak-minded is the unlikely milieu for this hilarious indictment of the American Dream of \\"Get Rich Quick.\\" The front office has handed down a mandate of \\"Always be closing,\\" with the salesmen's jobs on the line if they don't make their quota. [The title-quote of my review is how this threat, called a \\"sales contest,\\" is presented to our heroes.] The sweaty anxiety this induces in these low-rent con-men gives rise to retaliation, when one of them robs the office.     David Mamet's adaptation of his own Broadway hit (remember when there were actually good plays on Broadway, rather than endless musical adaptations of movies that sucked the first time around?)opens out the work, and adds two crucial scenes, including the infamous, brilliant, obscenity-and-abuse spraying Alec Baldwin \\"sales contest\\" monologue as a means of making the nest of vipers that populate the story more desparate, and hence more sympathetic.    But there are two things that makes this film essential viewing, if you can handle dialog that is perhaps 65% unrepeatable in this forum: a dream cast, firing on all cylinders, with several actors who too often fall into schtick giving the performances of their lives, including: Kevin Spacey as the officious office manager; Alec Baldwin as the vicious emmisary from the unseen bosses, come to crack the whip; Jack Lemmon as an ageing Willy Loman former superstar salesman who's losing his grip; Alan Arkin and Ed Harris as a Mutt-and-Jeff Laurel & Hardy duo, one a schlemiel and the other a bundle of rage and comic exasperation; and best of all, Al Pacino, using his often-questionable over-the-top mannerisms of recent years to great effect, as the master hustler, Ricky Roma.The scene where he strikes up a casual conversation in a bar with ordinary Joe Jonathan Pryce and spins a web of boozy ruminations around his unsuspecting prey until it becomes a full-blown sales pitch is a 10 minute master class in acting and writing, a true tour de force. The amazing thing about Mamet's masterpiece is that every scene is of the same quality, street language singing like operatic arias which build to gratifying climax.    The other reason to see Glengarry is the script-- there are more classic zingers than any movie in recent memory: Alec Baldwin: \\"What's my name?$%#@ you, that's my name!\\" Allen Arkin: \\"Are we speaking here, or are we just talking?\\" Al Pacino: \\"Vishnu himself could come down from the heavens...\\" And Jonathan Pryce's easily overlooked patsy Mr Lingk, seemingly incapable of getting out an articulate sentence in the face of Ricky Roma's sales pitch/verbal onslaught.     The late great Lowell George of Little Feat fame once said his lyric-writing aspiration was \\"eloquent profanity.\\" Mamet achieves this in spades here, and what a cast to put it over. Filmed theater at its best, screen acting pyrotechics to die for, and dialog so sharp it cuts like an electric knife. For cynicism and black humor, it's only match is Sweet Smell of Success.
B002ZCY7SW|5|great price
0064409422|4|I chose to read this classic by C.S. Lewis because every one else I knew had read it when they were younger.  I was told that it was an allegorical novel by a friend, which spiked my interest in what I considered just a child's fantasy.  Lewis fills his world, Narnia, with a wonderful array of different and interesting characters.  Fauns, Nymphs, Dryads, Naiads, and hospitable beavers all contribute to the fantastic nature of this story.  Lewis must have been a creative man to imagine such wonders and write them down.  A place where perpetually deadened by the cold of winter, with no Christmas and, therefore, no hope would be a terribly bleak setting.  The depiction of Aslan as a symbol of Christ was quite interesting.  Even the girls, Susan and Lucy, become similar to the two Marys in the gospel in their caretaking of the lion.  So as not to give away the story to anyone else I will end saying this unique world provides more than just a fantasy escape.  To both children and adults it provides a reminder that there is hope, even in our world, when it too seems cold and dead.
B000JLTRIG|5|i love charmed ever since it aired and im glad we can watch them again in the future.
B000O8OTNC|1|this sharpener sucks .. it messed up the blade on my Leatherman! I wouldn't recommend it as I am pretty disappointed I would have rather left my Leatherman blade the way it was before touching it with this tool.
B00GOZQ2E8|4|Good way to pass a few min or a few hours. Starts fast, slows down a bit, but picks up and remains interesting. Definitely recommend!
B000001EGE|5|One of the best rock albums of its time was Elton John's Honky Chateau album from May 1972. It is a terrific effort and sounds like a real band played on it. Gone is the &quot;wall of violins&quot; effect from earlier Elton records, and in its place we have some rocking and soulful tracks with some lighthearted moments thrown in as well. The Honky Chateau (D'Hierouville) in France was the venue for the recording sessions , and was the first appearance in the Elton John Band of the popular Davey Johnstone on lead guitar and mandolin.  <br />  <br /> Elton became the Rocket Man after his fantastic US #2 hit became one of his most famous songs, and thereafter a concert favourite. This tale of a disillusioned spaceman was timed just right for the tail-end of the space race. The second single was Honky Cat, which was a jaunty, fun-sounding song about the dilemma of whether to stay in the country near your roots or to seek your fortune in the city. Lyricist Bernie Taupin had lived this experience himself in the late 60's before finding fame in tandem with Elton after moving to London. The tune Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters is a splendid song - another of Elton's early classics. It is a sensitive song about people in New York, and has the sweetest melody and delightful piano and mandolin accompaniment. My other favourite song is the stomping Hercules - another rollicking rocker that bears Elton's adopted middle name! Salvation is also a nice one - this has a soulful style to its choruses and great backing vocals (a feature on this album), while Suzie and Amy are rock cuts that benefit from some quality teamwork among the players. Amy has memorable electric violin effects in it. <br /> Slave is a mid-paced track that sounds bluesy , while the whimsical I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself mocks its bleak tile with a lighthearted tap routine instrumental beat. Mellow is another song that runs along mid-tempo and is quite good.  <br />  <br /> Honky Chateau reached #1 on the US chart,and was the album that began his run as a dominant commercial force in 70's music. <br />  <br /> Overall, this is an excellent set, and I rate it 5 stars.
B00B2V66VS|5|Great game...love the challenges..keeps me entertained for hours....son loves it also....hard to put down...plays great on the Kindle Fire!!!! not much more I can say about...you must try it...
B003TSEEDY|5|The perks of being a wallflower is in my opinion the best coming off age story of our generation. I strongly suggest anyone and everyone read it and more importantly to appreciate its beauty.
B00AWBNNAG|5|It made it easy to make lego sets out of different lego.I also liked it because it helped me find older lego sets.
B000JMKQX0|4|This was a good read.  Unfortunately, I read the book after I saw the movie.  Two completely different stories that they almost seem totally apart, so don't worry about one ruining the other.  Take your time with this one and don't be afraid tore-read some parts.  Would definitely recommend.
B008Y7N7JW|4|I loved the part when she put the flowers around Rue and looked at the camera. Awesome yeah yes yes
B00DPM7RJW|5|Maybe Someday was my first Colleen Hoover experience and I was completely and utterly bowled over. I love romance. I adore stories that allow me to connect on an emotional level – particularly ones that dance with my own shadows. And I typically root for one the protagonist’s love story. Yet, Ms. Hoover turned all of these aspects on their heads and I loved and ached through every torturous turn of this tale.<br /><br />I am not one to ruin your reading pleasure by exposing the inner workings of a juicy plot line. I will tell you that once I picked this book up, I was unable to put it down. For me that marks the testament of gifted author. I loved the grey area she creates with complex yet relateable characters.And I can hardly wait to immerse myself in more of wonderful worlds and words.<br /><br />My reading preferences are subjective but I know this book will warm its way into the most cynical of hearts.
B00821OX98|5|Great show.  Good monsters. .. believeable characters. .. pretty scenery. ... what's not to love? Now that's goods tv right there :)
B000002I6V|5|I first bought this album when I was 17 and was amazed how it touched my soul. And now, some 21 years later, I have rediscovered it and am amazed how relevant it still is, and how it still touches my soul.
B002Q4TKAY|5|The Killers, a group of four likeable and extremely talented guys from Las Vegas who create exceptional music ( I mean in the footsteps of the Beatles exceptional), and who are well liked, respected, revered, and have number 1 hits and fill stadiums all over the UK, EU and Australia, have made a statement in this wonderful DVD presentation of their recent concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London 2009: Yo America - we are from your country and we really rock and put on a fabulous show - look at how we filled and energized the same location that the Beatles, the Stones and so many others filled and yet you have no clue what you have in us! You do not appreciate our crafted musicianship and our concert experience. We make folks happy and dance all over the world and they know the lyrics of most of our songs and sing along in a cacophony of musical bliss!     Buy this DVD and feel the emotion, the joy, the vibrant textures of melody, harmony, electricity and energy and see the Killers, the 4 lads from the USA turn this revered hall of music in Britain upside down with joy, presence and spectacular showmanship in the likes of Brandon Flowers, the lead singer, Dave Keuning, the fantastic lead guitarist, Mark Stoermer, bassist extraordinaire and Ronnie Vannucci Jr., the most energetic and exacting drummer since Bill Bruford.    America you can finally take notice of this great band made of our own native sons who make music like it was meant to be and touching all our souls! 5 Stars
B005ZOBNOI|5|I love this book , it made me wanna cry , I wish It had a happy ending , but that's life 💯
B007C7UZIG|1|when I tried logging in I was doing everything correct it keeps saying the same<br />thing over and over again plz fix and it would help me a lot!!! :)
B003Y5HWMW|5|First, I love these books, and this is a great adaption of it. The story is complex and dramatic, with fascinating villains and heroes. It's like Tom Clancy meets Lord of the Rings. HBO did a great job with the cast, visuals and script, equal to Rome (which is similar).<br /><br />That said, I must complain about the discs. Discs 1-3 worked fine, but disc 4 not only didn't work but prompted an update that disabled the ability of my Powerdvd to play ANY Blu-ray. Not sure what it did, but now I must run expensive software to disable protection to make it work.<br /><br />That is the irony of Blu-ray copy protection. It doesn't stop pirates, but it inconveniences paying customers. I consider what they did to me the equivalent of a virus. Someone needs to file a class action.
B00BETX5PS|5|Fast action and great plot - one of the best of the new James Bond movies. I highly recommend watching this movie.
034580404X|5|Shipping 👌<br />Looks exactly like the picture 👌<br />I'm satisfied 👊
B009UX2YAC|4|Me and all my friends love this game I hope they make a second one subway suede tee s rule!
0553260111|4|Soon to be in a multiplex cinema near you starring Matt Damon, Ludlum's super spy thriller is perfect pulp for the \\"Alias\\" or \\"24\\" lover in your family.<br />Jason Bourne washes up on a beach with no recollection of who is is or how he got there. Nursed back to health by a drunken doctor bits of his past slowly begin to come back to him, and with it the danger of his true identity. An identity that many would kill him for.<br />Detailed and intricate the plot is fast paced and action packed. The only down side to it, is it's near cliff hanger ending that pretty much expects you'll have the next chapter of the trilogy ready to go.
B0007N1AI6|5|One of the best metal albums of all time based on consistency, musicianship and sound.  I recognize JP as the best heavy metal band of all time, though I DO NOT buy everything they put out (i.e. Turbo through Ripper's stuff, though Painkiller had 2 or 3 great tracks). When I listen to all the old Priest classics, which are real classic albums, I tend to skip a song or two, especially some of the ballads.  No skipping on this my friend and not just because it is new.  Halford sounds amazing, even on the stripped down vocal parts - Amazing like 25 years ago. Glen and KK play some of their best leads ever, and Scott Travis (aka Big Man) - is he not one of the best rock drummers ever?
B003VS0CX8|5|THE SOUND OF MUSIC IS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE, I SAW IT IN 1965 AND IT IS STILL THE WONDERFUL MOVIE TO SEE OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
B0000214F0|4|I watched this with a Friend one night.  It made us stop and think was the Roman Empire really like this?  We experimented and found out that some of the scenes we were able to duplicate and others it would have been impossible, without killing or seriously maiming one another.  At the very least, the King was a cruel and extremely sadistic individual.  No wonder the Roman Empire fell.  This seems to explain that society as a whole has evolved little over time and that we have not really changed very much; just that we hide and harbor some of our thoughts, actions, and reactions.  We not only watched it once but several times and each time that we discovered serveral new unexplored and untried aspects we had not realized prior.  What a great movie.  I would not even allow children or even young adults watch this one.
B00BAXFAOW|1|I have read and truly enjoyed all of Malcolm Gladwell's previous books.  But David and Goliath is a concept in search of convincing examples.  Previous Malcolm Gladwell books were so interesting because the examples he used to convey the concepts so clearly made the point of the book.  Half way through David and Goliath I was asking myself, \\"What does this example have to do with the premise of the book\\"?  Frankly the examples he chose just missed the mark.<br /><br />I look forward to the next Gladwell book but as for David and Goliath - there are better books by lesser known authors that you should spend your time and money on.
B00003CXIP|5|Talk about recipe for success.  A story based on a Stephen King novella.  Directed by Rob Reiner, who turned out to be about as fine a filmmaker there is.  Narrated by Richard Dreyfuss (which is, in my humble opine, the best way to tolerate him in a movie).  And solid up and coming young talents like Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix (RIP), Kiefer Sutherland, and Corey Feldman.  All key ingredients to make watching STAND BY ME an unforgettable viewing experience.<br /><br />A coming of age story set in 1950s rural Oregon, this film is the superbly crafted tale of four adolescents in search of a body allegedly decomposing in the woods.  Yet this quest is not what the movie is about--not even close; the movie is about the four boys, their camaraderie, their insecurities and inner fears.  Accordingly the story weaves, and weaves effortlessly, from lighthearted to poignant to disturbing--and back again.  And it's totally believable:  The viewer is on the railroad tracks in the boonies, walking with the four teens, laughing and humming to the golden oldie, 'Lollipop'.<br /><br />STAND BY ME is fun, moving, sad. . .timeless.  I've seen this film countless times, and will no doubt watch it countless times more.  And isn't that how we honor great movies?<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]
B000003S0I|5|My favorite album of the 70's lineup of King Crimson which featured Wetton on bass, Cross on keyboards and violin, Bruffored on drums and of course guitar extrodinaire Fripp.  I picked this up after hearing the disappointing In the court...which never really struck a chord with me.  I own all three records by the 70's lineup and Larks is still my favorite album by them.<br />The two instrumentals, Larks' tongues in apsic pt1 and pt2 are both different from one another.  Part one starts out with what sounds like Tibetan bells followed by a quiet little riff before exploding into an explosive metal guitar by Fripp.  The second part in my opinion is not as good as the first but still ahs its moments, it erupts right after the crazy drumming of Brufford and dang, I forget the other guy's name on The talking drum.  <br />The other three tracks, Book of saturday, Exiles and Easy Money show the diversity of the band. The band can change styles and still sound coherent which is great.  Book of saturday and exiles are two soft guitar songs with strange lyrics courtesy of Palmer James. Then without warning Easy Money starts grooving along &quot;...got no truck full of ladida, keep my bread in an old fruit jar&quot; sings Wetton.   This track is filled with all sorts of strange sounds, the drumming is exceptional here.  <br />Not anything by the 80's lineup which included Adrian Belew, the former guitar player for Zappa, I would say this is the ultimate King Crimson album.  Starless has its moments, but the instrumentals and improvs on Starless sound loose and unfocused and Red simply is not up to par with this one.
B00JKGYW7W|3|I absolutely love Ed Sheeran, and when I saw I could buy his vinyl for my record player, I was ecstatic! However, upon receiving it and playing it for the first time, I was absolutely devastated to find that it skips. On not just one side of the record, but on two different sides in various songs! I saw how many people had positive experiences with the record and I was very hopeful, but I'm a little disappointed that I spent the money on a record that I can't listen to =(
B00G70WLJA|3|I liked it, doesn't follow the cannon closely but what movie does? it is an enjoyable movie worth watching. does a good job of letting wolverine delve into his human side
B005IZLPMY|4|I don't have a long history of comic book fascination but I really enjoyed this movie. Chris Evans is a great hero figure and the female (Hailey ____) is stunningly beautiful and lights up the screen every time she appears. The action sequences are well done and Hugo Weaving plays a menacing villian. This has all the components of a great comic hero film and it delivers in my opinion. To be frank, I think the music score could have been more influencial in the film and is somewhat lacking in \\"bigness\\" for this type of movie. I saw the 3D version in theaters and I actually prefer the traditional 2D of the blu-ray. This is a great addition to the Marvel Comics films and I'm hoping for a sequel besides \\"The Avengers\\", which looks very promising!
B009UX2YAC|5|AWESOMENESS
B00RNRD7Y4|4|I enjoy Seth's comedic humor.  With that said I did have trepidations watching this movie.  Regardless, this movie is about assassinating a real human being.  That in my opinion is just wrong.  Nonetheless in a moment of weakness, curiosity did get the better of me.  I do have to say that I did enjoy it, but minus one star due to depicting a real person to be killed.<br /><br />On a side note, I do wonder if this was a cartoon, if it would have had the same &#34;media&#34; response.  Team America did the same thing and there was no backlash against the move...
0684135051|5|this is a really great book. I like the writing style oif elisabeth zimmermann very much: she witty and intelligent and it's great to have her talking to you with this book. she quite unconventional, and that's what's nice about the book too. <br />a must have!
0062014536|5|Great book all the way to the end!
B00BSBR9N6|5|This book was such a fun read! If you watch &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34; you will  definitely see Sheldon in the main character, Don. It has come fun twists. I just really enjoyed it.
B00KNWYDU8|5|This is the best maybe some glitches but best in galaxy you should get the game please
034580404X|5|What can I say? My wife loved it, and that's pretty much the purpose of this set. She's read the set twice so far and dug it. Money well spent.
B00364K6YW|5|Colin Firth is the ultimate Mr. Darcy, although a mite too taciturn for too much of the movie for my liking.  He certainly didn't have a lot of dialogue to learn, he mosly acted with his facial expressions.  But he & Jennifer Ehle have a wonderful chemistry.  It's also a very rich & sumptous production & all the actors & actresses do a magnificent job.  I loved it!
0393327345|1|I was forced to buy this book for a class I was taking. This story is so ridiculously stupid, and the dialogue is pathetic. The one saving grace, at least in this edition, was that at end of the book, the author included his thoughts on writing this novel, and he basically writes that he was shocked as hell that so many people loved this terrible book he'd written.
B000006NUW|3|I wish there was a Motown box that omitted the Four Tops, Miracles, Temptations, and  Marvin Gaye. Why? Well, because any Motown fan should have retrospectives devoted to all of the above (although I personally despise the Miracles, heretic that I am). Yet there are amazing tracks from lesser-known artists that remain unanthologized or unavailable. I guess that's why they invented iTunes. But seriously, this music should be given to every child at birth.
B002M9WW30|4|I know it deserves a 5star, but i couldnt run it on my bluray player, which sucks..<br />Its a A region disc, and i got a B region player. so..<br />ordering from Us is maybe not such a good Idea...<br /><br />From Norway
B000AARKOO|2|This movie wasnt terrible, but I can't recommend it.  I fell asleep during half of it because it never caught my interest.  The efforts of the filmmaker seemed to be more asthetic then creating anything dynamic enough to hold your attention for a couple of hours.  It's a shame...the Crusades would have been a great storyline for a movie, but this is more like a boring fantasy.
B002JVWQT6|5|I'm a big Arrested Development fan and I feel like this show has that same ironic dry humor I loved so much with AD.  The writing is crisp, the laughs and gags are short and sweet, not overkill...and I like that in many of the episodes there is a sweet ending that shows how much the characters love each other despite dealing with family dysfunctions that we all can empathize with!<br /><br />The Blu-ray set has some good extras, but I would have loved to get some commentary and more behind the scenes features than what was offered.<br /><br />I am so happy that the Emmys rewarded this freshman comedy and hope that the writing remains strong and look forward to more episodes this year!
B00I8Q77Y0|4|Flappy wing is  a lot of fun it is a great game and it was a free game. The game is a challenge for me and it is very addicting.
B009UX2YAC|5|This is an amazing app!!! Once I start playing I can't stop! I even played while screwing my cousin!! That's how much I love this game!!
B0000634C4|5|best funny movie you ever want to watch
0525953728|3|The book--and the story--are fascinating.  If you're not interested in his background, skip ahead to the story of the planning and execution of the Bin Laden assassination.  Skip the last few pages ... he starts taking cheap shots and stops looking a hero and more like a whiner.  Really ruined the book for me.
B009AMALLM|5|Love this movie my girlfriend and I have every one of the Paranormal Activity movies!
B00AA0TJO8|5|My kids and I love playing it.  I think it is so cool that you get to draw your own characters, and it's fun to make the different tools and weather you need to complete the different levels.  Challenging but not bang-your-head-into-a-wall frustrating, and the company is really good if you have questions on something.  Love it.
B0094BB4TW|3|This works as advertised but the mobile app experience is considerably different than the web based one. I used this only when desperate Plus, the app assumes you want to stay connected 24 hours a day which is not the case.
B00L9B7IKE|4|The mixing in the three women was confusing
B005MLOKXA|5|I love this season, particularly the rivalry between state attorney's office and Lockhart Gardner. This season introduces some wonderfully contentious characters and brings them back every so often within the series - it's nice to see that bit of continuity and makes for a powerful second season.
B00ANA27IU|5|Phenomenal.
B004Q7CIFI|5|A good read.
B00N1HONIO|5|I love Five Nights at Freddys and I'm only eleven!!! &eth;&eth;
B002PZ6XB8|5|Sweet movie. Visually appealing.
B00DR0PDNE|5|I love the ease of use.  With all of the new apps that can be used with it now,  it is giving Roku a run for its money.  Now if we can just get Amazon Prime Video to work on it....
B004CFAWK2|5|Language was rough at times, but overall, a great book. It has so much more depth than the movie, but I still see the actors and actresses from it in my mind when I read the book.:-)
B00M2D7L2I|4|I hadn't picked up a Weezer album since Make Believe. I started listening to a couple songs of Everything Will Be Alright and was blown away. It really harkens back to the Blue and Pink albums. It's not as good as those two, but it's solid. Hoping future albums will be more like this album.
B000QCQ8Y4|4|Really an exciting read. Another Reacher action-packed thriller. The action just don't slow down.
B008XG1X18|5|I can spend hours on pinterest. Can find things easily. Love the share option. Sometimes though it won't let me post to Facebook.
B005LAII1C|3|Sometimes when you see previews the movie looks great. However, you get and watch the movie, the previews, or trailer<br />are the best parts of the movie. That's my opinion on this flick.
B000000OTU|5|First off I must begin this review that this is a good collection to start off with if you do not yet own any previous Aerosmith albums.  Admittedly there are other good songs that Aerosmith made that were recorded after this album (such as \\"don't want to miss a thing\\").  However as an earlier review posted stated this is a good place to start if you would like to hear some of their 80's and early 90's stuff at a budget price.  Some of the songs that I really liked on this cd are \\"love in an elevator\\" (9 out of 10),\\"rag doll\\" (10 out of 10),\\"Janie's Got a Gun\\" (8 out of 10), \\"Crazy\\" (9 out of 10), and \\"Living on the Edge\\" (10 out of 10).  There are various good songs on this cd but for me the songs I just listed are some of the reasons why I still have this cd after first buying this cd when I was stationed in Japan (and the last time I was in Japan was October 2003).  There are other collections that now carry a wide variety of the classic Aerosmith hits but this is one of the cd's to get if you are ok with collecting more than one greatest hits collection.  In my opinion this cd would be a good primer.
B00NH13W2W|5|Works great. It appears to actually be certified as well.  Highly recommend as this is much cheaper than the Apple cords and we all know these cords only last a couple months before they short out!
0446554995|5|Excellent book! It comes in 3 parts/books. I'm a huge fan of these authors and you can't go wrong reading the books!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|My husband and I both love this series - great characters with many story lines weaved together.  I highly recommend this series!
B000002UTO|5|I just discovered this album, and it is amazing - even moer amazing is why it got lambasted by critics when it was released! <br />The title track has a great beat, but my absolute favorites are \\"Too Late, Marlene,\\" \\"Do You Believe in Shame\\" and \\"Edge of American\\" - all three are beautiful (mid-tempo) ballads, and once again, Simon proves he is one of the most talented song writers out there.  Definitely recommended.
1442416890|5|Awesome. I am three quarters through the book, and the action hasn't stopped!
B001E75QGG|3|We enjoyed this movie but it was just more of the same.  The ending was deeply thought-provoking, but the only place in the entire movie that was so.  Great photography/cinematography, good acting, and good guy versus bad.  However, not as much fun due to the sameness of the earlier movies, except for the ending, which will challenge your intellect.
B0027MJU00|5|I really like psychological thrillers where the ending is not what you would think. I thought I knew who the killer was, but never expected it to be who it was. Great book!
B00CNQ7HAU|5|What would a Grisham novel be without the old south flavoring of the judicial system. Great characters, smooth plot, and some interesting characters you would just love to meet.
B00A81MV3U|2|This movie was very hard to get into. It was not what I expected at all. I would not recommend it unless you want to be depressed.
B00NOPQU2K|3|I was comparing it with Gone Girl and therefore a little disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5|Very great so fun you
B000JQU1VS|2|I've read \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" in a number of formats including paperbacks and a much beloved two volume annotated edition of all of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories and novels in chronological order. In spite of the price this version for the Kindle was a bit disappointing. A huge problem for me was that every time a sum of money was mentioned it was difficult, and sometimes impossible, to determine the correct amount because either there wasn't a symbol for Pounds available or it just didn't transfer properly when it was prepared for the ebook format. It felt as though it was scanned with character recognition software that couldn't read the symbol for Pounds Sterling.<br /><br />Another aspect that I wasn't particularly happy with was that the table of contents had no hyperlinks to the individual stories. I read the book straight through, but there are times when I'd like to revisit a particular story out of order. It's possible to do using search but it would be so much more convenient if linking were available.<br /><br />While all in all this edition delivered what I wanted - the first book of Sherlock Holmes short stories for the bargain price of $0.00 - there were enough problems and annoyances in the transition to the electronic device for me to regrettably regard the presentation of the book as substandard.
B004KBSQOW|5|His voice will haunt you for a long time. His passing is a sad loss because I have only recently discovered his music, and his oh so unique voice.
B00DM0UTPQ|4|This movie was surprisingly good.  Ed Harris, as usual, is excellent and David Duchovny plays a convincing 'bad guy'.  The plot is plausible (minus the secret technology element) and it explores a moment in history that has not previously been covered.
B00687Q0VC|1|So slow. Really not into it.
B0015AARJI|5|I bought this wireless remote for my 13 year old son as a Christmas present.  He hasn't gone one day without using since he opened it up.  He is very pleased with this purchase and so am I.
B00DPM7TIG|5|One of the best books I have ever read.
B00ESNDQWY|5|This is easily one of the top 3 shows on tv.  New ideas, great acting , great directing.  The only mistake they have made is the Michael J Fox character.  Doesn't add anything and doesn't ring true. Actually detracts.
B0025KVLUQ|5|One of the finest albums ever to come out of the Apple Studio from the Fab Four and producer George Martin.  Funny how the songs still stick in your head, the lyrics coming out with just four to six bars of the opening song.
B00A6CCF0K|4|I have read Stephen King since I have been a teenager and still  enjoy his books even now that I am long past my teenage years.<br />He has given me many sleepless nights. The Shining being the<br />reason for quite a few. I remember a book of short stories  that will I still reread to this day and they will still give me the creeps. GREAT STUFF!<br />I hope to introduce my daughter to Mr. Kings story's in a few short years. She is only 10 and I believe she needs a couple more years of innocence, but when she's ready I believe she will enjoy Stephen Kings stories as much as her mother did and still does.
B000B8QG4A|5|Growing up this was my favorite Disney movie and to this day it still is an excellent movie.
B00005O3VD|5|I PURCHASED THIS DVD OF FUNNY GIRL FOR MY BEST FRIEND FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE WAS STUNNED THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET IT. ACCORDING TO HER IT WAS FANTASIC WATCHING IT IN THE COMFORT OF HER HOME AND HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR IT IN AUSTRALIA FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. SO THANKS FOR GETTING IT TO ME ON TIME. I MADE HER DAY <br />REGARDS <br />LYN
B00005T30L|2|Being an architect/artist I expected this movie to be different from the hollywood mainstream.  Well it was different, but it was STILL A CHICK FLICK! No I didn't expect this movie to be an action adventure, but I thought it might some nice camera angles thrown in along with some strange characters.  The characters were [silly] and I found them to be very uninteresting.  The plot was very slow paced and nothing really happens that is different than everyday normal life.  I mean, come on!  Does Hollywood think that we are such ... that we would be interested in watching a movie about an outcast's very boring life?!?<br />The reason I think this movie is a chick flick is that there is nothing appealing for the typical male.  No action, nothing visual really to look at, no sex, no adventure, no witty lines, there wasn't really any positive male role models (all the guys were complete wimps, outcasts, and mental cases).  It was almost as if this movie was male bashing throughout.<br />It's advertised as the struggles of two females after high school graduation.  Well one character is someone normal and the other is supposed to be strange and interesting.  The movie focuses on the strange character, only she's not that strange and is uninteresting for the most part. You can go to the typical high school and find more interesting characters there.  About a 1/4 way into the movie the normal character seems to disappear for the rest of the movie.  Needless to say that she was the cute one and the only one that would appeal to the typical male.   <br />The main reason I bought this movie was because Steve Buscemi was in it.  He usually plays the quirky fringe character that is amusing.  Even his role in this was disappointing. I figured if Steve B. was in it then it would have some quirky characters.  Not even. <br />So as it is I give it (2) stars and that is just because it wasn't awful every single minute.  I rate a movie (1) star if they are awful the whole way through with not one scene worthy of watching.<br />As a Chick Flick it might be a (3) star movie.  It did focus totally on human interaction and relationships, the problem is that it's just not interesting enough.  Maybe it will appeal to someone who doesn't live in a city and they will think these characters are different and interesting.      ...  <br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone at all.  If you are a guy and your girlfriend/wife/relative wants to watch this movie then be sure to have a book or magazine to read otherwise you will get in a fight because you will be complaining so much.
B00CATSONE|5|I enjoyed so many facts and so much achievement for the times and the future.  As busy as his mind was he didn't have much detail of personal nature.  Much other thoughts about getting where we want to go.
B004GJDQT8|5|There is NO retailer like Amazon.

B00T4837W2|4|Luke Evans has presence, there is no denying it. He was dramatic, anguished, determined, and photogenic. He carried scenes all by himself. The weakest element of the tale was the romantic connection, it certainly didn't gel for me, though both Vlad and Mirena were lovely to watch. I think Mirena as played was too immature, not at all queenly. Another problem I had was there was no connection really to any of the other characters. No time taken to demonstrate the ties, it was like being dropped into the middle of a story without preparation. Brother Lucian, had a bit of chemistry with Vlad, if only the time had been taken to flesh it out. I wanted more, what had happened to bring them together as friends or persons with a shared interest? And Dumitru, he too could have been the brother in arms that gave the film depth beyond Vlad alone. In the few scenes they had together it was tantalizingly out of reach. Really I have to say, the film was rushed and a bit jumpy, yes. But time and again Evans (Vlad) caught my eye. Special effects, the flight of the bats, that was especially good.
B0032CVAQQ|5|I would recommend this book to any newly weds or anyone married! You have to learn how to live with another person...why not learn how to love living with them?!
B00BAXFECK|3|There is a fine book struggling to emerge from excess verbiage, six too many druggie scenes, unnecessary plot developments. Tough editor needed to cut the self-indulgence.
B00B2V66VS|3|I downloaded this game to see what the hype was all about.  It was entertaining at first but I lost interest quickly.  It is a great time waster if you are waiting for your significant other to try on clothes or shoes since it can be a quick game.
B008Y7N7JW|5|The movie was a very good adaptation of the book.  Very few minor changes from the book to the silver screen.  I really liked the character that they picked for Katniss and the supporting cast was good as well.  The Capitol was portrayed really well which I thought might be an issue for the movie.
B004R5Z4GO|3|I decided to read this book because i enjoyed Mitch Albom's \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,again a true story which is another reason i was drawn to the book.   For me it wasn't as good as \\"Tuesday's\\" but i did enjoy/get a lot out of it particularly the Rabbi's take on life in general.I would have never thought, especially being brought up a Christian, that i would identify so much with his core beliefs and for that matter the Pastor's as well!  The book gave a very personal account of the Author's relationship with his Rabbi after being asked to speak at his funeral and the contrasting life of a Detroit Pastor who definately grew up on the wrong side of town! Their lives in many ways were in stark contrast and yet they both had the same devotion to wanting to make a positive difference working with God.This resonated with me because my core belief is that all Religions go back to the same God,its all about Love!
B00GRVV29E|4|best game
B0017U7PT6|2|This movie is easy to look at, gives you something to do while you think about something else and best of all it's disposable.  Sure, you can invest your precious time in paying attention to it, but does doing so really get you anywhere and do you come out of it a better person?  Probably not.  Rent this, but before you return it scratch it up really badly.  You have now just paid it forward: The next renter, unable to watch it, will be saved 2 hours of time he probably should be spending mailing out child support checks anyway.  Job well done.  Pat yourself on the back.    But seriously, don't pay for this movie.
B00G4Q3KOC|4|very strong and emotional
