B00005JMFR|5.0|I strongly agree with the positive reviews that declare this to be one of the best movies of all time. If you haven't seen it yet, please ignore the critic's reviews as they are trained to see the technical aspects instead of being able to just enjoy a movie. This movie takes the viewer further that you could have imagined possible with the characters, plot, and visual effects. It keeps you glued to your seat and always wanting more. I never thought Neo and Trinity could make your love their characters more, but this movie does that and SO much more! I really got into the movie and felt like I was living and doing right along with the characters. I promise you that you will love it!!!
B0000CAQ27|5.0|Okay...I was really skeptical at first.  I didn't think much could top M!ssundaztood, but lo and behold, P!nk did it again!  I'm glad that she decided to revamp herself, I think that's what makes an artist last.  The whole cd is full of catchy, pop/rock fun.  I could do without &quot;Catch me While I'm Sleeping&quot;, though.  Just a little boring.  Other than that...she really hits the mark.  Especially in &quot;Oh my God&quot;  and &quot;Humble Neighborhoods&quot;...my two favorites.
0385504209|5.0|This book is a wonderful examination of many of the beliefs that the world currently accepts as fact.  The research and detail transport you through the story at an amazing pace.  One of the strange things is that the entire story takes place in about a day and a half.  For those reviewers, who have complained about the &quot;expert&quot; forgetting standard DaVinci history at points, neither of the main characters gets any sleep until the last 6 pages.  They travel all over Europe on no rest.  His forgetfullness can definitely be forgiven.<br />This book definitely ignited my interest in this topic.  Be assured that the next time I look at a piece of art, I will remember a lot of the hidden meanings that are revealed here by Dan Brown.

Then I heard 'Paranoid Android', and with its progression of slow/melodic then guitar just forced me to enjoy it as well.<br />Then I picked up a copy of this album, and I finally understood why people enjoy this ART of an album. I have nothing to say that hasn't already been said, I just want the rating to go up to 5 stars.<br />k i ck i n g    s q u e e l i n g    g u c c i    l i t t l e    p i g g y

B0000DJZ7W|5.0|Wow Celine!!  This is by far the best album of her career, and I am glad she is getting such great reviews.  I just wish her English albums were as artistic and beautiful as this one.  This album is absolutely amazing!  Best album of the year!!

B0000CDLA7|3.0|Dear DT fan friends! <br />I just don't know what to say! What a disappointment!!!! When I started to listen the album, &quot;As I am&quot; was beginning just like the way that SDOIT ended. When the bass begun to play that wonderfully terrifying theme, I felt a chill &quot;falling&quot; over my spine. That was getting greater each time the music was going on. When this music was finishing, I could only think how extraordinary the other music would be. After &quot;As I am&quot;, I felt a complete emptiness. With the exception of &quot;Honour Thy Father&quot;, the other music are merely normal, almost trivial, especially &quot;Vacant&quot;. <br />Another bad point is that there are several music that James LaBrie doesn't sings, but yet other singers, and that is just horrible to me!!! This seems more like a &quot;Metallica&quot; album, believe me. Rudess is very discrete having no amazing (and usual) solos. Myung hasn't a part that we can say &quot;WOW&quot;! <br />In the future I'm hoping for three things to happen: - 1- That the next album would be far away better than this one; 2- I have already the ticket to their show here in Portugal. I hope they play a lot of previous albums music...; 3 - I sincerely HOPE (maybe I'm getting crazy) that this album doesn't means a separation from some of the group members, or even that this is representing DT ending...!
0060934913|2.0|I don't mind the foul language, I come from a construction background and understand that in some fields that it's almost &quot;necessary&quot;. I thought the individual stories were interesting, but Bourdain keeps jumping around from memory to memory, not keeping with the &quot;timeline&quot; feel he starts out with. It's confusing to know which job he is refering to and where that particular job fits in the timeline.   <br />He also has a tendency to be long winded. I found myself jumping ahead of some of his descriptions that were quite predictable and over done. <br />All in all, I was very disappointed in the book. The story of the &quot;underbelly&quot; of cuisine is a fascinating one, but Bourdain didn't quite &quot;cut the mustard&quot; with his version.
0385335482|1.0|One of the worst written books I've ever come across, the writing is awful, as if the writer was just trying to cash in on the recent sludge of chick books. Cute cover, but that's about it, the rest of the book is worthless.
B00008BXJF|2.0|I'll preface all of this with the fact that I've seen King Crimson at least a dozen times and have most of their records.  I've been a big fan for a long time.<br />I just came back from seeing them at the Beacon Theater in NYC.  They sucked plain and simple.  Actually to say that would be an insult to bands that really suck.  I would have preferred to see a single encore by Living Colour than the entire King Crimson set!<br />I gave this record a listen first.  I like it a bit more than the Construction of Light (which should be renamed to the &quot;Perpetuation of Pomposity&quot;).  But sorry, this record's poop.<br />Robert Fripp thinks he is King Crimson.  Perhaps legally he is -I imagine he owns the name and benefits the most from the &quot;franchise&quot;.  However to the fans it's always been a team effort.  In this fans opinion, this is no longer the case.<br />So firstly I can't believe how little Pat Mastelloto adds to the music.  He plods through in his Mr. Primitive way - not that I mind that kind of style - Jerry Marrotta on the Peter Gabriel records embodied a great primordial sense of primate level percussion.  So do many others.  Pat plods.  It stinks.  I feel rooked.  I hated all of the new songs from this record, which, I borrowed from a friend prior to seeing this show.  Live they were even worse.  <br />Trey Gunn's seems interesting.  But come on.  Would he even EXIST if it wasn't for Tony Levin?  He's talented and has some unique stuff to say.  But Crimson (used) to be synonymous with the highest order of originality.  Why should we settle for a pale replica of an original?  I wonder that if Trey had any self respect, he'd walk away from the role of being a Tony Shill and do his own thing.  I liked him and wonder if that can't be far off.<br />And this all leads to the very point.  King Crimson's a machine.  Pure industry.  Innovation's just an advertising slogan at this point.  Fripp sits in the shadows to deflect our attention.  Yet this instead focuses it.  Is his shyness is calculated or sheer marketing at this point?  Is this pathological behavior or manipulative?  Who knows?  When they keep putting out junk like this record I believe it's likely more manipulative.  Unlike many other Crimson records, this one is devoid of anything human, interesting, innovative, or emotional.<br />Of course it sounds good.  The gear from Japan these days is first rate.  And these guys are experts at production.  If I was a guitar player, I might be more into it.  As usual Fripp and Belew expand the range of sound - but they don't do much in the name of Art.<br />So I keep wondering when are they going to start to return to what King Crimson used to stand for - innovation.  Sadly, not with this record.  <br />If your a guitarist, you might like it just for the sounds.  Otherwise stick with the KC oldies and go listen to someone else play something newer and more interesting.
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown's book includes a good deal of information about a world that has been hidden in plain sight for a very long time. To a greater or lesser extent depending on the denomination, Christian religious practices include many pagan rites and rituals. The most obvious center on pagan holidays such as Samhain (Halloween = hallowed eve of All Saints Day) or the example in Brown's book that involves the rites of spring.  Those with art history and/or comparative religion backgrounds will be familiar with most of the `occult' information Brown shares (if you can find it in books I guess it isn't too well hidden).<br />However, it is important to keep in mind that Brown's tale is a work of fiction, and as such, the comments and thoughts of the protagonist (Robert) and other characters may or may not be accurate.  For example, the purported millions of people burned at the stake for \\"witchcraft\\" is exaggerated as are the assertions that they were all women and the Roman Catholic church was responsible for all the deaths. Research conducted in the 1990s shows: 1) The numbers of \\"witches\\" burned at the stake was much lower than previously thought; 2) Many of those executed for \\"witchcraft\\" met their fate in Germany, Denmark, and Scotland (nominally Protestant countries at the time of the witch burnings); and most of those executed were not killed by church or secular authorities, but by apparently hysterical illiterate villagers who were both Catholic and Protestant (i.e. Salem in the New World). Perhaps as a result, Italy-a nominally Catholic country-is purported to be the home of the \\"evil eye\\" and many modern witches. (Raven Grimassi, a hereditary Italian witch, has written extensively on this topic).<br />Fiction versus non-fiction aside, my one irritation with Brown's storytelling is that he pulls his punches in the denouement-probably because the editors wanted to increase book sales.  I can't say more without giving away the plot-but this book is not THE NAME OF THE ROSE.<br />While I admit to reading the book non-stop, I wasn't \\"scared\\" after the first few pages. I read on because I found Brown's  weaving of occult information, art history, pagan lore, technology, Templars, Masons, and Paris fascinating. I have a personal interest in the machinations of Rome and the Knights Templar. My grandfather was a very high ranking Mason (as have been most of the male members of my mother's family) and my grandmother was a member of the Eastern Star (as have been most of the female members of my mother's family).  On the other hand, I was raised Roman Catholic because my father was RC (and a Knight of Columbus). To say I absorbed a good deal of conflicting information during my growing up years is an understatement. I could really identify with Sophia.THE ROSE.  <br />While I admit to reading the book non-stop, I wasn't \\"scared\\" after the first few pages.

B00005JMFO|5.0|This movie is very entertaining and well done.  It is about all aspects and forms of love.  It is told in a light-hearted, entertaining way.  One interesting thing about the movie is that one of the many characters is completely ridiculous and unrealistic, and another is the complete opposite - serious acting, actors and theme.  Also, it is very clear some kinds of love do hurt.  Such as the unrequited love.  Or loving a partner who strays. Or the death of a loved one.  And the sister who, well, see the movie.  All kinds of love here.  And all kinds of acting, and all kinds of themes.  A unique way to script and produce a movie, that is refreshing and works!  An excellent Christmas movie about Christmas, and love in all its forms.  If you can tolerate a bare bottom or two and some humorous lewdness that is part of the theme of the skit, go see this movie.  I highly recommend it.
B0000CFW87|4.0|This appears to be a better recording than his first offering. He did explore his voice on this production a little more. Josh appears to master his \\"medium\\" range voice, but appears to be somewhat limited in his \\"higher\\" register range, in other words, Josh is not able to hit high sustained tenor notes. But he's good enough. The music is also pretty good, especially OCEANO, YOU RAISE ME UP, and SI VOLVIERAS A MI.
B0000DZ3IG|2.0|There are quite a few romantic comedies out there that have been vastly improved due to their soundtrack.  (Take for example, &quot;Serendipity.&quot;)  And some soundtracks add the finishing touches to great films.  Everytime I hear Harry Connick Jr. and Louis Armstrong used &quot;When Harry Met Sally,&quot; it makes the experience even more enjoyable.  <BR>     &quot;Love Actually&quot;'s soundtrack fits in neither of these categories.  In such a great movie, where the relationships span over several different ages, they really needed to stick to a more timeless selection of music.  Since they jump from the Beach Boys to Maroon 5 to Wyclef Jean (great artists in their own right) the music is so diverse, that it defeats any kind of main theme and ruins the experience.  (Yes, they all talk about love, but that's not suitable for a movie like this).  <BR>     If anything, the Billy Mack song is great, purely for its camp value.  Other than that, a pretty big disappointment compared to the film itself.

B000000XB9|4.0|I LOVED this album BUT, I find it hypocritical to sing Senators Son when the singer CHICKEND OUT of war and joined the national guard.
B000058983|5.0|I remember that hot and sunny July 4th in the year 2002.  Having read more than enough about how great this CD was, I headed up to Harvard Square early in the afternoon determined to buy this CD, which I had never heard a single note of.  When I got home, put it in my CD player, and heard the gentle, tip-toeing opening notes of \\"Alone Again Or\\", my life forever changed.<br /><br />There is something way too beautiful about this CD. (Or, more correctly, there are too many beautiful things about this CD.)  It sounds like nothing I had ever heard before or have heard since, and is, to the extent that such a thing can be ascertained, one of the greatest CDs ever recorded.<br /><br />Released in 1967, Forever Changes has the general sound and feel of a hippie record.  That is, it is easy to guess it was recorded in the late 60s.  However, it is a bit too dark at times to have been written by hippies.  The lyrics are often ominous and apocalyptic, eg, \\"And the water's turned to blood, and if you don't think so, go turn on your tub\\" and \\"They're locking me up today, they're throwing away the key, I wonder who it will be tomorrow, you or me.\\"  The clearest indictment of the hippie mentality, however, occurs on the first track, the impeccably beautiful \\"Alone Again Or\\": \\"Yeah, I heard a funny thing/Somebody said to me/'You know that I could be in love/With almost everyone./I think that people are the greatest fun.'/And I will be alone again tonight my dear.\\"  Note that the singer is quoting someone else in between the lyrics \\"You know\\" and \\"the greatest fun.\\"  It is clear from the song that he is too in love with one particular person to be in love with everyone.  And when Arthur Lee sings \\"The news today will be the movies for tomorrow,\\" he is clearly resigned to the fact that the scars of wars never heal, even after the wars themselves have ended.  (So much for peace and love.)<br /><br />\\"Alone Again Or\\" -- written by the band's guitarist, Bryan Maclean, who also wrote the gorgeous \\"Old Man\\" -- is surely one of the greatest opening tracks on any CD.  (If it is  not enough to convince you that you are in for a real treat, go ahead and stop listening.)  The opening notes of the song, though quiet and nonintrusive, sound soaring, and are enough to give a robot a spine-tingling sensation.  The harmonies on the song are warm, embracing, and ever-so-slightly subdued (and put to shame some of the annoying harmonies found on \\"Rubber Soul\\"). The song's strings underscore the song's melancholy lyrics, while the trumpets - which get the solo - provide a musical accentuation of the aforementioned vocals.<br /><br />While this song alone is worth the price of admission, the entire CD is a cup that runneth over.  While soft and gentle - but at times ominous - acoustic riffs and arpeggios are sprinkled generously throughout, Love doesn't forget the value and power of an electric guitar, as demonstrated on \\"A House is Not A Motel\\" and \\"Live and Let Live.\\" The brass and strings - on \\"Alone Again Or\\", \\"Old Man\\", \\"You Set the Scene\\", and elsewhere - adorn each song in an unpretentious and unforced way that the Beatles could have only dreamed of when they made \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\"<br /><br />The lyrics always sound emotional and sincere when sang in Arthur Lee's fragile and ghostly voice, whether they are all-too-simple (\\"And you don't know how much I love you\\", \\"I feel shivers in my spine\\"), or slightly more profound (\\"Served my time/Served it well/You made my soul/A cell\\", \\"There's a man who can't decide if he should fight for what his father thinks is right.\\")  Sometimes, alas, the lyrics are too obscure for their own good: \\"I feel real phoney when my name is Phil\\", \\"I believe in magic, Why?/Because it is so quick\\", and the classic \\"The snot has caked against my pants.\\"<br /><br />But perhaps lyrics such as these just add to the eccentricity of the CD, as they always sound poetic and interesting.  Only on a CD as strange and beautiful as this one would such lyrics be forgivable.  And Love manages to deal with the overdone themes of popular music (unrequited love, uncontrollable lust, etc) in refreshingly unique ways on \\"Alone Again Or\\", \\"Andmoreagain\\", and \\"Bummer in the Summer.\\"<br /><br />The only problem that I have ever had with this CD is the first two tracks are so powerful that they threatened to overwhelm the entire disc, and I sometimes had trouble moving beyond them.  And while \\"Alone Again Or\\" will always be one of my all-time favorite songs, I have since learned the folly of my ways.<br /><br />I would like to say that anyone with an ear for great music will like this CD.  However, any record that is as unique as this one is bound to not sit well with some people, and that I can forgive that.  It does not spoonfeed it virtues to the listener the way punk or power pop does.  Its appeal is simply not obvious enough to be widespread.  One will either sink into this CD as if it were quicksand, or it will just sound too unexpected to be likable.  It is, whether you like it or not, one of the greatest masterpieces of popular music, even if it isn't right up there with The Eagles' Greatest Hits or Michael Jackson's Thriller in terms of sales.  And don't let the constant references to minor-key acoustic guitars and apocalyptic lyrics scare you. This CD has always made me feel like I was sitting atop a mountain on a sunny day in California, even though I had never been there until eight months after I bought it.  Having been there since, \\"Forever Changes\\" always takes me right back.<br /><br />(PS - The remastered edition with seven bonus tracks - including alternate takes and 3 songs that did not apprear on the original record - is the one to get, and is well worth whatever extra money you will spend on it.  And I recently saw Arthur Lee perform live with a new band in Boston.  The whole of \\"Forever Changes\\" was played, along with at least a half-dozen other Love nuggets.

B000075BFK|3.0|There was a reason that tupac kept these songs hidden and unreleased.  They just aren't that good.  The production (if you can call it that), is just thrown together to make money.  With the exception of Thugs mansion (real version), Still Ballin' and a few others, there's no real bangers on here.  Many of the songs are just remixed from old lyrics that tupac had lying around.  They also added some guest appearances from the Outlaws, Aaron Hall and Nas to name a few.  I don't see how the remix of Thugs Mansion with Nas fits in with all of this.  Aaron Hall shines on the chorus of Thugs Mansion.  The Outlaws are not as good as they were on Until the End of Time.<br />A prime example of a recycled song is the track &quot;What'chu Gonna Do&quot; where the first verse contains the same lyrics as tupac's very early song &quot;Fright Night&quot;.  I believe they should have kept this album on the shelf but then again, anything with tupac's name on it will sell so I guess I can't fault Suge Knight for wanting to make more money......<br />~For die hard tupac fans who want the whole collection or for those who aren't familiar with his earlier material.
B0000035E7|3.0|I'm with the person that gave this three and a half stars.<br />I probably would have liked it much better if Dave Grohl had been in the band. Its good, but the drumming is just weak. One of my favorite things about Nirvana is just the noise of it. Or maybe that didn't sound that right. The sound. And a key part of that sound is the drumming. Its not given that much credit, but when you have Chad Channing on the drums and not Dave, it just doesn't work.<br />Sure, there are a few songs that are okay, but nothing *great.*<br />*deep nod*<br />Okay. It grows on you, though. Its nothing special, but its okay.<br />But its Nirvana, which makes it good, eh, my lover-ly Blink-182 fans?<br />[/sarcasm]
B0000AR8NK|1.0|I hear so many sounds, calypso, harry connick jr, and a narrow range of voice on this cd. Not one song sent me and his artwork matched his music, chaotic and unoriginal, Sequieros eyes. Once I heard it I didnt want to play it again. I think a guitar instrumental would have been better. I guess his collage style of writing has run dry. That is why he shouts water, water.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have been a DT fan for sometime and I am very satisfied with this new CD.  I like the heavyness and the agression it delivers, not in hatefull way either.  One very high point, for me, is the song Vacant.  It has a beutiful melody and a haunting cello line that just pulls on your emotions.  For all you guitar players John Petrucci is the real deal and delivers some of the most amazing solo playing ever on this CD.
B000002L5I|2.0|Shepherd knows his instrument well, but he's not the best blues guitarist out there. The Stevie Ray Vaughan influence is so strong sometimes it feels as if I'm hearing SRV himself, albeit a more tepid version. Heck, if I want to hear Vaughan, I'll go out buy his CDs why should I care for any wannabes?  That said, this can copy Vaughan to a scary degree. Still if you want to a real modern blues virtuoso, I'd suggest you check out this Chicago virtuoso called Melvin Taylor. That guy is something else altogether. Trust me, I couldn't believe anyone could play like that when I first heard him.
B000006045|5.0|After listening to years of heavy metal and industrial, but never being able to find a comfortable middle with Enya/Enigma I was amazed to find Massive Attack.  This is definately something I have been searching for, and as the first MA CD I have bought so far, I'm amazed and overjoyed.  <br />The changing lyrical tones and voices mixed with the techno heavy beat background makes this CD a regular in my rotation
B00005O5UI|4.0|I believe the previous review is referring to a different edition of Benefit. This Japanese LP Sleeve version is a small reproduction of the LP cover (no annoying white band saying remaster etc. which the previous reviewer referred to).
B00005BL2A|5.0|When in a band, it becomes more than boring to do the same thing over and over for more than twenty years. Exciter is what a band does when they don't want to move away totally from what they are (sort of like the Faith and Devotion Album...which is too harshly viewed in my opinion) yet still want to add more to what they have been. Tracks like Comatose could have appeared on any other album while tracks like the awesome dance song &quot;I feel loved&quot; definately belong here. There is beauty and haunting on this album. Don't let those long time &quot;hardcore&quot; DM fans scare you out of Exciter because they don't want people to evolve. This isn't punk rock - Don't worry about the &quot;Selling out&quot; Cliche. Buy this album.
B00006ALGL|5.0|Damien Rice with his powerful vocals and emotional lyrics really bring out the everyday ironies that he brilliantly smiles inwardly on. Its compelling and deeply moving. Its truely is worth every cent you spend and you will be amazed with every song......Its something you can pop in and not have to change tracks its that good with the instrumentals and beautiful accompaniments. If you havent noticed I love this cd.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie became my favorite animated film.  I really just wanted to add a vote, so if you are looking for a review this is not it.  However, I do want to say that as a 16 year old, I have told too many people to count to go see this movie, and even before I saw it, my friends, older cousins who took their kids to see it, and my younger cousins all were greatly impressed.  It gained greater ground than even The Lion King, Monsters, Inc., and even Toy Story had gained.  And that is saying alot.
0451197968|5.0|Let me preface this reveiw by urging anyone who has seen the movie to not judge the book by it.  This book, although not 1984, is far more profund than anything with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it.<br />Ben Richards, the lead character in The Running Man, is accurately described by one character as an anachronism- he beleives in fidelity and virtue in a bleak dystopian world obsessed with 3D Perverto Mags and watching their fellow man killed on the &quot;Free-Vee&quot;.  However, he is poor and his daughter is ill...the paltry unemployment check must be used for food and he does not wish to see his wife reverting to prostituion.  He turns to the Games, barbaric exploits of human suffering to appease the masses, and is chosen for the most prestigious, dangerous, and rewarding game- The Running Man.<br />In The Running Man the one doing the running must elude the Hunters for 30 days, using the whole world as his arena.  However, the running man must send two videotapes per day back to the Network- enabling the Hunters to pinpoint his location.  Nonetheless, Richards is resourceful and skilled at dissapearing into the bowels of large cities- he has nothing to lose except his life, and knows that the money he makes will reach his wife regardless of whether he lives or dies.<br />I couldn't put this book down, but upon finishing it, (incidentally the ending hits a perfect note for a dystopian novel) I realized there was more to the book than &quot;met the eye&quot;, if you pardon the cliche.  Stephen King (although this book was writen under the psuedonym of Richard Bachman) includes enough social commentary -be it concerning class division, pollution or the television's ability to put blinders on one's eyes- to entice someone looking for more than just an exilarating action novel.<br />Highly reccomended, but avoid the movie like the plague.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Timeless tale of greed and desire, as three down-and- out men track down elusive golden wealth.<br />The movie is set up extremely well, as we learn about the men and their lot in life, well before they set out on their dangerous quest. <br />The parallels of greed resound today, with the corporate scandals and such.  The riches that tempt men's souls can destroy the weak.  Management techniques of the trio are on display as well, as they face challenges in the bleak wilderness.<br />The movie really holds up well under 21st century scrutiny. Every scene has meaning and their are many, running sub-plots and themes that remain true to themselves as they interweave,leave and then return throughout the movie.  Keep your eye on the young Robert Blake, he had a small but amusing role in the beginning.<br />There are not many movies that have as much to offer, scene after scene, as this one does.  Those who speak spanish will enjoy some of the un-translated dialogue between various locals, it is not spoon fed with accented english as so many movies do today.  Great stuff!!
0441172717|5.0|My Uncle is the one who encouraged me to first read Dune. Ever since I can remember, my Science Fiction-loving uncle always favored Dune. I picked it up and I will admit it was quite hard to get into at first, but I stuck with it and am glad I did. <BR>    This book introduces interestingly imaginitive characters and tosses them into a wonderfully intricate world. Not only did Frank Herbert create a world, but he provided histories, legends, cultures, ecology, and even prophecy in order to bring this world alive.<BR>     The world of Arrakis is one of the most exciting ones I've ever read about. The Fremen culture is so cool. They fight with unmatched fury, they know secret legends and ways to live in the desert, and yes, they even lure out the giant (and feared) sandworms to the surface and ride them across the desert.<BR>     The universe created by Herbert is awesome. It is a future where, although there is technology, the weaponry is swords and daggers. Only one group of people have the means of interstellar travel, and they have a monopoly. And everything depends on the only important thing of Arrakis, the spice. <BR>     I've heard this book compared to Lord of the Rings, and I agree that this is a likely comparison. I highly recommend Dune.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|What many of these reviews have failed to mention is the outstanding remastering and mixing these recordings have undergone!<BR>The pre-Nebraska section is eye-opening. The improvements over the standard CD releases is startling. Whether you're listening in your car, your high-end stereo or your iPod, it's obvious.<BR>The three &quot;Greetings&quot; tracks are cleaned up a bit, but the &quot;Wild, Innocent&quot; two are flat-out revelatory. Crisp, clean, balanced. Chuck Plotkin was thanked in the booklet, and I can see why.<BR>The 'Born To Run' songs sound as if a layer of grime has literally been scrubbed off. The strings and piano sounds, as well as Clarence's clarion sax, have never sounded so sharp.<BR>The 'Darkness' tracks benefit from an improved drum and vocal sound, and is just overall better mixed. Same goes for the 'River' tunes, of which there are only two.<br />The extras disc is gravy. Why quibble? It's just a great sampler of stuff for the rabid fans (like me) out here without access to bootlegs.<br />What excites me the most is that this is the first sign that Bruce and company are considering remastering the old albums. If this is any hint at the possibilities, the mind reels. I can't imagine whole original albums sounding this good...they would become mandatory purchases for even those only minimally interested in Springsteen.<br />...could &quot;authorized&quot; boots be next? We can only hope.
B00006V9A0|5.0|this gretest hits compilation of nirvana is great, i've listened to it so many times since i've bought it and i love it, all the best songs are here such as 'lithiun, 'come as you are', 'where did you sleep last night', 'smells like teen spirit', all the best songs are here so i reccomend this to everyone who likes nirvanas most popular songs.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|A while back I did a reveiw of a few DT side projects. LTE, Platypus, Explorers club etc. And I asked the question, Are we better off with a breakup of DT into smaller groups ?<br />Well my friends the answer is YES. DT must break up. This CD proves it, and to those who understand I extend my hand.....<br />This CD by any other band would be considered good to very good. But coming from DT it is like a chinese meal, sur you're full now, but 10 minutes later you're thinking that's it ?<br />I bought a milk carton today, and saw Rudess and Myung's picture on it !!! Where are you guys ?????<br />Remember anytime you see that 1 or 2 band members are producing an album, run to the hills....OVERPLAYING !!!!!!! We don't need a billion notes a second to know how good a musician is.....please we need musical structure, melody and originality.<br />Metallica died after And justice for All. DT should have stopped after SFAM....<br />And a bigger question is....are we really getting everyones best in DT or just filler stuff until a new supergroup comes along....<br />This album will be remembered as the last one from DT.<br />After the 6th time of listening to the CD, it got better but the problem is that we know they could do better, but are their hearts into it ? Playing new metal is kids stuff...we want more !!!.<br />My hopes for a better musical experience now lie with Porcupine Tree.......<br />I'm out...
0380789035|5.0|Absolutely delightful! Personally, this book goes in with my list of absolute favorites! This book is well on its way to becoming a classic for sure.....
B00008CLOA|5.0|I kind of grew up around Pink Floyd. Since I was a little kid, I had heard a lot about them; about how they were so influential, about the &quot;subliminal messages&quot;, and of course, how it synchs up to &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot;. From my friends, my dad, my uncle, etc. So eventually, I lent an ear.<br />I was kicking myself for not having listened to it earlier.<br />I can see why this is the fourth best selling record of all time. It combines psychadelia, rock, jazz, space sounds, heartbeats, clocks, and all kinds of other goodies - all in one album. With this album, even if you're not a stoner, you can just put it on and drift away. Especially to &quot;The Great Gig In The Sky&quot;...whoever would've thought that operatic singing over a piano would be so good? Even the interlude &quot;On The Run&quot; provides audio bliss. (I love that one effect...I can't describe it, it happens twice in the song...like it's passing by, you know?) And then, there's my personal favorite, &quot;Money&quot;. Catchy, long, great lyrics, about how people let great financial gain go to their heads. Songs like that make this one a classic.<br />As for whether or not you should get the 30th anniversary SACD edition: you should. Sure, on a normal CD player it sounds the same, but it costs the same amount, and it includes pictures and original album covers in the insert, so you get more bang for your buck.<br />Anyway, I recommend this one. Buy it, and drift away...I hope to see you on the dark side of the moon.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS ALBUM?10 YEARS OF EVOLUTION IN DREAM THEATER MUSIC...BUT THIS IS NOT DT TO ME.ALL THE COMPOSITIONS SEEM OUT OF INSPIRATION ,LIKE THEY WAS MADE HASTILY.THERE ARE SOME GOOD MOMENTS IN ALL THE SONGS BUT THEY ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR MUSICIANS LIKE THEM AND OF COURSE IN COMPARISON WITH THEIR PREVIOUS ALBUMS.I OWN THIS ALBUM AND I HAVE LISTENED TO IT MANY TIMES TO FIND SOMETHING EQUAL TO THEIR PREVIOUS EFFORTS.I DIDN'T.THIS IS A VERY HEAVY METAL RECORD AND THE METAL FANS WILL LIKE IT.PERSONALLY I'M NOT A HEAVY METAL FAN AND I DON'T LISTEN DT BECAUSE THEY ARE HEAVY BUT CAUSE THEY SHOWED ME AND TO THE WORLD THAT THEY ARE SOMETHING MORE THAN A ROCK BAND.THE THING THAT SAVES THE ALBUM IS THE EXCELENT MUSISIANSHIP;THEY MAKE BAD MUSIC GOOD MUSIC.PETRUCCI HAVE NEVER PLAYED SO FAST AMD HEAVY AND WITH NO ESSENSE.THE SOLOS ARE TECHNICHALY VERY GOOD BUT THEY AREN'T DEEP AS PETRUCCI USED TO PLAY.THIS IS THE ''GO FOR THE MONEY'' ALBUM.AS IT SEEMS THEY WILL MAKE IT GOOD...
0316666343|4.0|&quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; captures beautifully and movingly a most memorable line from American poet jani johe webster:  &quot;life and death hold hands and dance around each person.&quot;  <br />In this novel, the young and likeable heroine (a heroine with attitude) experiences this dance of life and death even from beyond the grave, where she watches, in her heaven, the pain and the growth of her loved ones, who struggle with her murder.  Through the observation of this struggle, the narrator is able to make meaning out of her life and continue to experience a deep love and connection with her family, as well as an odd, almost friend, and her would-have-been boyfriend.  And in remembering her, each character also experiences the dance of life and death:  each character, in his or her own way, grieves and carries on with greater self-knowledge and deeper self-connection.<br />The book is a joy to read:  the voice of the narrator is distinctive and rich (we feel like we are listening to a teenager who has thought about life); the prose, details, and tension in listening to the narrator watch her murderer's strange and horrifying rituals, are gripping.  We become deeply involved in each character and also in the quest for the narrator's family to find both justice and meaning.<br />In this book, we see and feel again how painful is the dance of life and death:  painful, but not without hope.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I've been teaching classical and rock music for 2 years now to high school students.  Everynow and then I love to blend the two.  Dream Theater does this effortlessly, something I'm envious of.  In an age where spooky videos and wardrobe sell more records than musical substance, it's nice to see a band that delivers great technical ability and superior song-writing.  When one of my hot-shot guitar students masters a Disturbed song, or plays Mudvayne or something bland, I throw some of DT's music at them...most don't know where to begin, but it's often when they put away tabs and power chords, and bring out the text book and start practicing scales and arpeggios.<BR>  <BR>The album only has 7 songs, but comes in at well over an hour.  It's probably their heaviest album to date, but unlike Six Degrees, doesn't sacrifice harmony and melody to sound heavy.  And it certainly doesn't sound like a rehash of earlier work, though it does keep that awesome DT signature sound.<BR>Each musician is given the time to showcase their talents, but all within the context of the song-not just showing off like some other prog metal bands.<br />I won't say it's their best album to date, because it's so hard to choose, for some listeners it may well be.  Definitely a nice addition to an already incredible catalogue...can't wait to see it live.<BR>On a side note, DT pays tribute to a few heavy metal legends, Pantera and Megadeth, in some of the riffs and vocals on this album.  Nice to see a classy act like this when most bands spend their time competing for T-Shirt sales and bad-mouthing the people that made heavy rock music accessible.<br />Wicked album-don't miss out.
B000089RVR|5.0|After purchasing her first CD a few years ago I fell in love with it.  I just knew that I would have to get this one as well.  It received fab reviews in People magazine, which are terribly hard to come by.  I have practically worn out the CD as I listened to it over and over again while I refinished some furniture.  She seems to take her music personally, as if it reflects something extremelly meaningful in her life.  This CD will age well, so if you are considering adding this to your collection, do not wait any further.
B0000W3YIS|5.0|Britney Spears \\"In The Zone\\"  is yet to be one of Miss Spears best albums.  On the 4th album she has become more real with herself and the listeners.  No more bubble gum /first kiss lyric.  Each song is very individual and doesn't blend in with each other so you won't get sick of it.  This album is still good for the whole family.  Miss Spears has grown into a woman.  On this album she has shown it in a very classy way. I have the pre-release of this album and gave it my review.  <BR>1.  Me Against The Music (10/10) The collaboration with Madonna and the club vibe makes this one of the best<BR>2.  Boom Boom (7/10) The beat is very catchy her collaboration with Ying Yang was a wise choice.  Soutern background is a plus<BR>3. Showdown (10/10) This is the best song on the album.  The rapping, the words, and the good beat is what makes it the best.  It shows a new sexy Britney<BR>4. Breathe On Me (6/10) This song reminds you of \\"Bedtime Story\\" (Madonna) Its a more repetative electronic song.  She talks throughout the song which is very cool<BR>5. Early Mornin' (5/10) This song which was produced by Moby doesn't sound like it and other tracks do which is odd.  The song is pretty good in general it takes a while to grow on you cause its like a r&b but pop song.  It has a little clash but a good song about the next morning after partying hard.<BR>6. Toxic (10/10) This is one of the best songs on the album.  It has a funky '60s intro and ending.  Which makes it cooler.  Everyone I have played it for loves it.  Its a song you will either love or hate.  Wanting a bad boy and she is in love and the guy being toxic and your 'intoxicated' is very cool.<BR>7. Outrageous (6/10) This is hip hop/rap all the way.  With the singing and beat.  It has a Arabic tone to it.  <BR>8. Touch Of My Hand (8/10) The intro is Chinese base.  This will be the most conterversial song on this album.  I am proud of her taking the choice to sing about 'pleasing' yourself.  Its something that you shouldn't be ashamed of and it states you don't need a guy to be happy.<BR>9. The Hook Up (6/10) Very werid intro.  The singing is pretty well done don't really dig the lyric.  It has a Bob Marley regaee vibe. 10. Shawdow (9/10) This is very Pro-Britney of her last album.  I love the intro and the climax when she sings \\"It's Only Your Shadow\\" A very good slow song <BR>11. Brave New Girl (7/10) This song to me makes me think it should be put on a soundtrack like Legally Blonde... It is very peppy and happy.  I love the rap intro and then it becomes very pop.  I dig the new Britney this is also very Pro-Britney.<BR>12. Everytime (10/10) When first performed on SNL I was in love with the song.  The way she wrote and sang this is unbelieveable. This truly shows off her talent and power.  A great love and breakup song which is something new.  I must say her live performance did show off her vocal points better then the album version.<BR>13. Richi Rich Remix (7/10) This Remix of Me Against The Music is a pretty good one. People actually seem to like this version better then the origanal. They made a good choice I do think they should have included another remix or a live version of one of the album songs.
B00005JMFR|5.0|I've heard some people talk about this movie negatively.  Personally, I believe that this was a great way to wrap up the mind-blowing Matrix series.  Yes, many did expect it to be mediocore.  Luckily, I decided that these people shouldn't decide my opinion for me, and I saw the movie as soon as I could.  It is a MUST SEE.  The effects are revolutionary, the acting is incredible, and the story is captivating.  I would reccomend this movie to any serious movie-goer who likes a good picture that makes you think.  I did feel the ending was sufficent, and definately made the audience think.  Anyone who bashes the way this incredible movie ended obviously doesn't like to see anything thought-provoking.
B000002UAR|5.0|Rolling Stone magazine just came up with the results of the 500 greatest albums ever,and Revolver comes in at no 3 on the list!!!
B000002J0B|5.0|Arguably their best album ever, this is the only Zeppelin album that has no filler songs. They start out great with \\"The Song Remains the Same.\\" \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" sounds like it is going to be a horrible song because of its name, but really its one of their best songs. \\"Dancing Days\\" is also a cool song, probably third best on the album. \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" is only okay, but was released as a signle even though it was probably the weakest on the disc. They finish off the album with \\"The Ocean\\" which is the second best on the disc. You can't go wrong with Houses of the Holy because there is something there for all tastes.
B000002UAO|5.0|Rolling Stone just came out with the top 500 albums ever, and Rubber Soul comes in at no 5!!!! As it should be.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I think changing direction in music is respectable, if it's original.  <br />The quintessential Rock Gods have left the room....
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I watched the DVD last night and was HUGELY disappointed. True to the original Matrix the Wachowski Brothers created a massive world filled with amazing special effects and visual candy. The problem is the movie is SO BORING! Like George Lucas before them, the Wachowski brothers lost themselves in their own convoluted mytholgy, spending more time on sci fi babble than on characters and plot. There are countless points in the movie where we are forced to listen to the brothers' pretentious dialog that does nothing to move the story forward. <br />Whats with the fight scenes too? Did their sound editor actually use an effect of bowling pins being knocked down when Neo battles 100 agent Smiths? What could have been an really cool action scene felt more like a Road Runner cartoon. Even the kung-fu scenes lack speed, energy and suspense. You can sacrifice plot for really good action but when the action stinks, it really misses the mark. Yes, the car-motorcycle chase scene is incredible and but unless you are a die-hard Matrix fan I would encourage you to save it for a Friday night rental rather than make it part of your home dvd collection.
0385504209|5.0|This book is a fast paced adventure that was researched quite well.  There is some conspiracy element to it, but it is written in such a way as to not detract from the readability of the book.  The puzzles, the suspense, and the art history make it a thoroughly entertaining read.  I, like other reviewers, found myself doing research tied to what was in this book - everything in the book was tied to reality.  After the Da Vinci Code, you may want to read Angels &amp; Demons, which I actually enjoyed more - it has an element of science that makes you ask yourself &quot;Could that really happen?&quot;<br />If you have ever been to the Louvre in Paris, you will know that Mr. Brown's descriptions are exactly right.  I was able to visit the Louvre for a quick look back in 2002 and the book described a lot of the things that I saw.  Da Vinci Code gives you inside information on the Louvre, while Angels &amp; Demons gives you inside information about Vatican City.  I read this book faster than any book I have read in the past - so beware, you may want to start on a weekend when sleepless nights are more easily tolerated.
B00005JMFR|3.0|First of all, I am a huge fan of \\"The Matrix\\". Having said that, this last film is a huge cop-out.  I think the Wachowski bros. owe their audience at least a plot they can follow.  <BR>The biggest irritation for me was having an idiot Neo that couldn't recognise Agent Smith in another body.  Smith was the only guy in the whole show (with the exception of the boss in the first film) who called Neo \\"Mr. Anderson.\\"  So for Neo not to put two and two together was crazy.  It was like Luke figuring out that Lea (the only female in the story) was his sister.  Duh!  The other point of irritation was the ending where everything was digitally restored to happyland status.  Wasn't the point of getting out of the matrix the fact that it was a false reality?  And after all of the fighting and the mystic sayings, all that was achieved was a \\"stand-off\\" where everybody who's left lives in a sunnier matrix.<BR>It is a little like fighting World War 3 for a 10 cent per hour raise and better parking at a dead-end job you hate.
B00005JMFR|3.0|From the creative and visual and phyilosophical experience I had in Matrix and Matrix Reloaded, Matrix Revolutions is not what I expected. 1st : The $ 40 Million action scene at the discotheque...hey I dont' see the $ 40 million reflected in that scene. It's a very good action scene but not a $ 40 million budget. 2nd : extremely too too too too too too too many centinels going in Zion. 3rd : the battle between Agent Smith and Neo is too anime : Smith Flying !!! come on !!!. 4th :About Trinity (you have to see the movie)...I saw Neo puting a great effort in saving her in Matrix Reloaded but in this one NOTHING !!! CERO !!!. 5th : the ending is quite good but there is not a convincing final conclusion. Will there be a Matrix 4 ?.
B00009V7P8|5.0|&quot;o&quot; offers only ten tracks, yet Damien Rice and his harmonic chord makers, two female and two male vocalists, accompanied only by guitar and (yes) cello, with understated precision bass and drums, create more fresh sounds than needed to top any land's or year's chart for best album.  Ireland and the continent got this veteran Dublin band in 2002.  Letterman, O'Brien, and Leno finally got them to the U. S. this summer for their first U. S. tour, so they could take home MTV's &quot;Short List&quot; first-place award among 100 CDs.  Damien, with all that new material in your trunk, please bring back your glorious Dublinish guys and girls--Shane, Tomo, Vyvienne, &amp; your vocal soulmate, Lisa Hannigan.
B00005QEO1|5.0|In 1987 Aerosmith made a huge comeback after being considered 70s has beens. Still riding high on Permnant Vacations success the band entered a studio in Vancouver. With the sessions done in 1989, Aerosmith unleashed another hardrocking masterpiece. This album recaptured their 70s swagger & took it to new levels. The band fires on all cylinders and this album contains no weak spots. This album is fun, fast, and is a goodtime like a rock album should be.<br />1. Young Lust. 10/10 Starts the album with a bang. Great drum solo ending.<br />2. F.I.N.E. 10/10 Great hard driving song. I love the sexual innuendo.<br />3. Love in an Elevator. 10/10. Amazing guitar solos drive this song. Brillant sleazy lyrics, dripping with innuendo. One of their best ever.<br />4. Monkey on my Back. 9/10 Another great hard driving rock song.<br />5. Janie's Got a Gun. 10/10 Covers the serious topic of child abuse and manages to flat out rock. Very gutsy, dark song, and a true masterpiece. I know people who hate Aerosmith but concede this is a great song.<br />6. The Other Side. 10/10 Starts with some Dulcimers then they unleash on another great hard rock song.<br />7. My Girl. 7/10 The album dips a bit at this point only because those first 6 songs were so blistering. This is still a good song just overshadowed by the preceding songs.<br />8. Don't Get Made Get Even. 8/10 Captures the attitude towards and ex.<br />9. Vodoo Medicine Man. 7/10 Good song, but another one that is overpowered by the earlier better songs.<br />10. What it Takes. 9/10 Very good album closer about surviving a break up & moving on. It is a power ballad but holds up unlike most 80s power ballads.<br />Many consider this Aerosmith's best album. It is their best after the 70s for sure. Must have for hardcore fans and a good place to start for those just getting into Aerosmith.
B000060P79|4.0|I have to admit I like Simple Plan. I bought the album because I did like &quot;Addicted&quot; and &quot;I'd Do Anything.&quot; I'm glad I bought it.<br />No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls is a great catchy album. Most of the songs are fueled by a catchy chorus and guitar rifts. Most of the tracks don't sound the same which really does enhance the cd. Simple Plan doesn't follow the hypocrisy of Good Charlotte either in saying there punk.<br />&quot;Addicted&quot; is a good song. It's gotten tons of radio play. &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot; is another song thats gotten radio play. &quot;Perfect&quot; <BR>is there latest song to be on the radio. I think it's one of the better songs on the album. It's a song most teenagers can relate to. &quot;I'm Just a Kid&quot; is another song teens can relate too. I liked &quot;My Alien&quot; a lot. It's a catchy song with some funny lyrics.<br />I know Simple Plan is one of those punky pop trend bands. They will most likely not be around in 10 years. This is a great album. I can put it on and listen to the whole thing and not be disgusted with half the songs. It's easy to see why there popular and think most teenagers will like this one.
B00000F169|5.0|DARK STAR is the most un-romantic, stark, hysterical vision of space exploration ever filmed. Carpenter and O'bannon capture the suffocating boredom perfectly! After floating around in deep space for 20 years, even blowing up entire planets has  become dull routine. The crew are sick of space, sick of each other, and have turned into apathetic numbskulls. The ship computer is a female voice of monotony. The planet-destroying bombs (yep, they talk too) are loopy, cheerful drones. Only when pending disaster threatens everyone aboard is any excitement forced into these poor shmucks' lives! Watch for the beachball alien. He's a trip! Check this out if you're tired of all the meaningless outerspace spectaculars of our day...
B00005OWIU|5.0|I must admit I have not read a Harry Potter book to this date. I have seen both movies and enjoyed both of them a ton. The movies however would not be nearly as good if not for the score written by John Williams.<br />&quot;Hedwigs Theme&quot; is a great song and will be the song you will remember most from the movie. It's a beautiful song. I love how it starts off on the bells. It adds a feeling of unknown awe when it's played. It's also great when it's not played on the bells and is done by the orchestra. It's probaly Williams best song of this new century. Fans of his will be well pleased and I think this one alone makes it worth getting the soundtrack.<br />I liked &quot;Hogwart Theme.&quot; The christmas song was also good. It's just a good mix and blend of music. Williams score accents the movie so well. It brings the world of Harry Potter to life so well.<br />This soundtrack is a must own. It's some of Williams best work he's ever done. It's right up there with Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Superman, and Jurrasic Park. His fans will love this album. Fans of Harry Potter will really like it. People that like classical music will also enjoy this one a lot.
B000002OX7|5.0|Pete Townshend's idea of an extravagant (to say the least) multi-media musical/cinema/theater event titled \\"Lifehouse\\" is perhaps most famous for NOT becoming tangible, rather than being known for what it was in itself. After a doomed struggle to launch the ominous project, Townshend suffered a nervous breakdown, an incident as famous as Bob Dylan's motorcycle crash or rock drummer Rick Allen's loss of an arm in a road accident.<br />After a shaky recuperation, The Who produced \\"Who's Next,\\" a compromise originally made of several songs intended for \\"Lifehouse,\\" emerging unquestionably as one of rock and roll's greatest albums. When dissected from the \\"Lifehouse\\" concept, the songs no longer became connected, but \\"Who's Next\\" still seemingly carries a banner of endurance and meloncholy; lines such as \\"Don't cry, don't raise your eye\\" and Roger Daltrey's unbeatable shout of \\"Meet the new boss--same as the old boss\\" all express a sense of emerging from hardship; 'The Song is Over' can be seen as Townshend mourning his unworkable creation; 'Bargain,' 'Baba O'Riley,' 'Won't Get Fooled Again,' and John Entwistle's grim and witty 'My Wife' (the only song here not intended for the \\"Lifehouse\\" project) are just some of the songs that have become staples of both The Who's repetoire and of rock in general. Also worth noting is the fact that \\"Who's Next\\" was a pioneer in the use of synthesizers, but the sound here is clean and perfect, as opposed to the overbearing sound the devices produced in the next decade, and never detracts from the bare-knuckles rock element.<br />Although its origin is complicated and distorted, \\"Who's Next\\" is a flawless example of rock at its finest and artistic expression--a cliched phrase which is almost meaningless when applied to anything else--at its best.
B00000IQMT|5.0|I bet John Williams loves doing Star Wars music. Here is a man who is one of the greatest composers alive. He's got the Oscars and the nominations to prove he's no fluke. Not to mention the record sales. When Williams is asked to do a Star Wars film the music is already basicly in place.<br />The music of Star Wars is fantastic. This soundtrack contains most of your favorite songs from the early films and has a couple of new ones that I think Williams and Star Wars fans will enjoy.<br />&quot;Duel of Fates&quot; is the best track on the soundtrack. Williams has really outdone himself with this song. I love the chorus in the background. They add a different demension to the song. The trumpets are absolutely fantastic. I play the trumpet and this is a trumpet players dream. The melodoy to the song is great and I have to give props to the London Symphony Orchestra.<br />This is a good album. I don't think it's as good as the early films or episode II, but I'm glad I own it. Fans of Star Wars will enjoy it, so will fans of John Williams. People who like classical music will also get a kick out of this one. You'll like it. Trust me.
B00006GFAB|4.0|I DON'T CARE WHAT NOBODY SAYS, THIS GREATEST HITS COLLECTION WAS PROFESSIONALLY PUT TOGETHER, UNLIKE THAT DUMB-A** 20TH CENTURY MASTERS COLLECTION CD. ALL THE BEST SONGS ARE HERE, LIKE ''ROCK AND ROLL ALL NITE'', ''STRUTTER'', ''DEUCE'', ''LICK IT UP'', AND MANY MORE. I WAS VERY SUPRISED TO SEE ''GOD GAVE ROCK AND ROLL TO YOU'' ON THIS CD. THAT SONG MAY VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE GREATEST KISS SONGS EVER MADE. I GAURANTEE YOU, IF YOU ARE A KISS FAN, AND YOU WANT TO GET ALL THEIR BEST SONGS AT A REASONABLE PRICE, THIS IS DEFINITELY THE WAY TO GO. Y'ALL REALLY NEED TO APPRECIATE THIS CD A WHOLE LOT MORE. EVERYTHING CAN'T BE PERFECT.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I loved Deep Space Nine. I thought it was an excellent show and I'm gald to see it on DVD.<br />DS9 had hard and high expectations. It was the first spin off of the Star Trek The Next Generation. When the show premeired it had to compete against TNG for fans and sometimes ratings. A lot of trekkies were skeptic about the whole idea of life on a space station and were scared to see something else besides a crew of the Enterprise. I think thats what made the show so great,it's orignality.<br />Avery Brooks was awesome as Commander Sisko. Season one developed him very well as we saw a man trying to turn his life around. I thought he was brillant in &quot;Emmisary&quot; and after I saw the pilot I knew this show would last. Commander Sisko is one of the most underrated characters in Star Trek. Avery Brooks played him to absolute perfection. He's a great actor and a great man. You'll love the way they develop his character in season one.<br />It was good to see Colm Meaney on the show. Give credit to the producers for putting Miles O'Brein on the show. He was always a key character to the show. You always knew the chief was going to get it fixed. He reminded me a lot of Scotty in what they did with him.<br />Nana Visitor was great as Major Kira. It was cool how they put a Bajoran on the station and how they made it a co-op leadership thing. To this point in Star Trek all we knew about the Bajorans were Ensign Ro and the Maquis. They developed the race well and once again it all starts in season one.<br />Rene Auberjonois as Odo was one of the coolest characters ever in tv. Star Trek executives made a smart move and made him a shapeshifter. Then they did a really smart move and modeled him after the T-1000 from T2. It was brillant. He was orignal and cool looking. Props to Rene for wearing all that make up. He played the character great.<br />Armin Shimmerman as Quark was great. Once again DS9 developed a race the Ferengi that not a lot was known about. Quark was the comic relief to the show and Armin hit a home run with the role. Quarks one of the funniest and most loveable characters to ever come out on a sci-fi show.<br />Terry Farrel as Lt.Dax was awesome. The whole idea of the trill was a cool addition. I love how they developed Dax and Siskos friendship from what it had been. Terry was hot on the show. It was sad what they did with her in the later seasons, but she remains one of my favorite Star Trek characters ever.<br />Alexander Siddig was great as Bashir. They started Bashir as kind of the hopeless romantic who is out to show what he can be. He wanted to practive frontier medicine. Once again I like how they developed his character. He was a great addition to the show and Star Trek universe.<br />DS9 was a great show. This is the shows humble beginnings. It had to compete against the highly rated TNG and it easily holds it own. It might be a little darker than some trekkies like it, but me as a casual Star Trek fan love it. I think DS9 was a great show and this is something all Star Trek fans should own. People who don't like Star Trek might like DS9 becaue it's not the Enterprise, but an original and fantastic show setting place in the same time period and the same Star Trek universe.
B00008OWZC|5.0|About six months ago, I heard the news that Led Zeppelin was coming out with this live CD set as well as a DVD of live performances. At the time, I was a pretty big Zeppelin fan, not a huge fan, but more than the casual listener. Anyway, I began to hear people talk about how great of a live act Zeppelin was, and I began to eagerly anticipate these realeses. I went back to my Led Zeppelin albums and gave some of them a real listen, which I had never done before, and I loved it. In the studio, Zeppelin was amazing, and if what people were saying about Zeppelin being better live than in the studio was true, this CD set was bound to be something amazing. Needless to say, my expectations for this CD were off the charts. I will admit, however, that I was slightly skeptical they could exceed their studio material with their live performances. When my package arrived with this CD (as well as the DVD) enclosed, I eagerly rushed to my stereo and popped in disc one, a smile on my face in anticipation of what I was about to experience.<br />That smile quickly turned to a gape of amazement: this CD was probably the biggest surprise of my listening experience. I mean, my expecatations were high, but they were just blown away when I excitedly played this 3-CD set. It was incredible to hear a band I loved take their studio songs and just transform them into completely new masterpieces, it brought back all the freshness and amazement at hearing the studio version for the first time. I remember hearing Stairway to Heaven and just being amazed at how fresh and new it sounded... it was like going back in time to when I first heard the studio version. The whole album was just... awesome, from the thunderous opening of the Immigrant song to the amazing closer, Bring it On Home. Every song, except Moby Dick which is a wasted 20 minutes, is great. Not just \\"really good,\\" but Great with a capital \\"G.\\" Zeppelin has the uncanny ability to take a song, and just jam it, keeping it roughly the same length, but making it sound so different. Most \\"jam bands\\" play their songs pretty close to the studio version, but with a live \\"jam\\" in the middle where individual members of the group go off and solo. While Zeppelin does some of this, their jamming is present all the way through the song; that is, they just play the song different, but with the same basic concept as the studio version. I really can't describe just how good this album is. I'm being completely honest when I say every track is phenomenal. The only real downfall to this album is Moby Dick  Yes, John Bonham is amazing, but a 20 minute drum solo... who has the patience to listen to that? Well, I don't want to end this paragraph on a bad note, so I'll just reiterate what I previously stated: this album is amazing!<br />The thing that makes Zeppelin so great is that all the members in the band or EXTREMELY talented at what they do. To say Jimmy Page isn't a top-class guitarist is downright blashphemey, and to say that John Bonham isn't one of the best drummers means you're just ignorant and/or stupid. Same with Jonesy and the bass. Whether you like Robert Plant or not is an opinion... but you can't argue with the musical talent of Page, Jones, and Bonham! Just to give an example of this: in a recent poll of top ten bassists, guitarists, lead singers, and drummers, all the Zeppelin members took place in the charts. You know what the lowest rank was of a Zeppelin member was? #2. Well, you can't always be perfect, but this album is as close as it gets.
0517201658|5.0|I just recently caught the mini-series on TV, and my mom gushed how much she loved the story when she first saw it. I expected the book to be your typical sappy romance fare, but not so. The characters are strong, and very well developed. We can delve into their lives, and understand how their backgrounds influence their actions and motivations. <BR>My only complaints are that towards the end of the book, the drama fizzles out. Too much attention is paid to the unsympathetic and uninteresting character of Justine, and her relationship with the equally boring Rainer. As for Dane, I found him to be a little too &quot;perfect.&quot; While he was supposed to be a better version of Ralph, the author should have given him at least one flaw. It would have made his character easier to identify with. The whole reason why Ralph worked so well was because he was a flawed human being, and struggled his entire life to reconcile that reality with his desire for perfection. Although, it did seem as the author tried to make him a superfluous character at end. She drifted away from the main story of Meggie and Ralph.<BR>All in all though, The Thorn Birds is a great book, very descriptive and emotionally involving.
B0000C9V3T|4.0|I knew what I was getting into when I bought this. I knew some of the music may not exactly fit into the genres I like...but I've got an open mind. The &quot;whistle&quot; tune is here, and several others you'll recognize, plus some soundbites from the movie.<br />It's a good cd, but it's even better once you go to [...] and download the songs that aren't on the album, then you will be complete.
B0000028M7|5.0|Yeah, buy this CD, its the best decision you'll ever make in your life:<br />1) Them Bones(10/10):Kicks off the album, along with your ass. Killer guitar solo too.<BR>2) Dam that River(8/10): The only real track on the album that I dont absolutely love.(nameless/track10, I don't consider a track.)<BR>3) Rain When I Die(9/10):Beautiful lyrics, not good enough to merit a 10 though, their second worst song on the album, but still very good. A track that all the members wrote together.<BR>4) Down In A Hole(10/10): The ultimate ballad of depression and sadness. Cantrell is a genious, and his voice blends beautifully with Staley's, like in most of the song.<BR>5) Sickman(10/10): Great metaphorical song, a cool little jig with that Psalm.(Isn't it 23?)<BR>6) Rooster(10/10): A very emotional song of war, video is great too. To which is better Rooster or Down in a Hole is something no mortal can do.<BR>7) Junkhead(9/10): Heavy, heavy drug refrence..... the intro is tight.<BR>8) Dirt(10/10): Is the source of the albums name, more frustration than blatant sadness like in DiaH or Rooster.<BR>9)God Smack(10/10):Great guitar chorus, like all the other tracks this song kicks ass.<BR>10)_________(?/10): Just some weird crap.<BR>11)Hate to Feel(10/10): Layne's best song he wrote on the album (Jerry wrote the most)<BR>12)Angry Chair(10/10):You can't get the lyrics out of your head, and you don't want to. Great drums, and nice transition from light to heavy.<BR>13)Would?(10/10): Arguably the greatest song ever made.<br />BUY DIRT!!!!!!!!!!!!
0783225903|4.0|If you liked Twelve Monkeys, you must see this film.<br />I was jaw-dropped and confused at the end of this... and it takes a lot to do that. Involves Government, the future, and perception. If you're a Matrix fan shame on you if you haven't seen this. And prepare...it's twisted and surreal.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Usually, rarities/B-Side collections appeal only to the serious fan, but \\"Lost Dogs\\" should appeal to the die hard and the casual fan.  I say this because instead of the usual collection of outtakes and material that is clearly not album worthy, Pearl Jam has put together two CD's that easily contain an album's worth of material.  I mean that quite literally, they could have easily worked up a dozen songs from the thirty found here and put together a studio release on par with their other albums.  Moreover, the excellent liner notes offer great insight into Pearl Jam's recording process and the origins of their songs.<br />It would be impossible for me to comment on all of the thirty songs in the available space, so I'm just going to touch on the highlights.  However, that should no way indicate my dislike for the balance of the material.  A few of the songs (Sweet Lew, Bee Girl) are quirky, but none are by any means bad.<br />The first track is \\"All Night\\" from the No Code sessions.  While it was understandably left off the album (it's totally out character with the rest of the songs on it), it is a pretty great song.  With a driving guitar line and interesting vocals from Ed, it actually presages some of their later work, and would fit right in on Binaural or Riot Act.<br />Next up is \\"Sad\\" from the Binaural album, and which I would have gladly seen in the place of \\"Evacuation\\".  This is a beautiful song with the great atmosphere that characterized that album.  Ed's vocals have a haunted quality, and the lyrics beautifully capture the pain of a lost love.<br />\\"Down\\" appeared somewhat regularly during the 2003 tour, and there was much discussion as to why it didn't make the album.  Having now heard the studio version, I have to say that I prefer the song live.  Lacking here are the flourishes and energy that made it one of the highlights of the tour.<BR>\\"Don't Gimme No Lip\\" is interesting as a window into Stone's development as a writer.  While not a bad song, itis very simple, and not in the same league as \\"Mankind\\", for example.<br />\\"Alone\\" was really a blast from the past; I had forgotten how raw (and I mean that in a good sense) Ten was; it plays like an open wound and \\"Alone\\" fits right in.  Another song about relationships, this song features the raging guitars and Ed's characteristic wail that defined the early days.  A great cut, and one I'd love to hear live.<br />\\"Education\\" is a really interesting track because it is largely unlike anything you're likely to find on a Pearl Jam album.  Matt's fingerprints are all over this one, with an almost tribal drumbeat.  Takes a few listens to get used to, but it's become one of my favorites.<br />\\"Gremmie Out of Control\\" is off a benefit album and is a cover of a silly surfer song from the 1960's.  Two things make it noteworthy; the first is Stone's back-up vocals, which are completely over the top and absolutely hilarious.  The second the guitar work of producer, engineer, collaborator and all around friend of the band, Brendan O'Brien; you'd think that Brian Wilson was playing with them.<br />\\"Undone\\" is an absolutely amazing song from the Riot Act sessions.  Again, it's not really in keeping with the rest of the album, but I still wish they could have shoehorned it in.  Actually, it would have fit perfectly in place of \\"Bu$hleaguer\\" which I've always found to be uncharacteristically negative.  Featuring beautiful, hopeful (but still protesting) lyrics and a Springsteen/REM hybrid sound, this is in the top three on Lost Dogs.<br />Disc 2 kicks off with \\"Fatal\\" from the Binaural session.  Another moody, complicated song, it was producer Tchad Blake's favorite, but somehow didn't make the album.  <br />Next is \\"Other Side\\" which is an absolutely beautiful song that, if not crying out right, certainly had me tear up a few times.  Written by Jeff and inspired by his parents' marriage, \\"Other Side\\" describes the sadness of those who pass on and are forced to wait for their partner.  Offering both a unique perspective and heartfelt lyrics, anyone this song will touch who has been in a long-term relationship.<br />\\"Strangest Tribe\\" is off the 1999 Fan Club single and is a simple but fascinating song.  First off, the sound is amazing; while mostly acoustic guitars, Ed's voice, the simple drumbeat and a few ell chosen effects lend a distinctly Middle Eastern sound.  The lyrics capture the oddity, but simple beauty of faith.  This is a song that deserved a wider release, and offers a look at Pearl Jam from a rarely seen angle.<br />\\"Drifting\\" is Ed's take on Dylan, and it isn't bad, not least because he has a much better voice.  A simple song about living life simply, it's got a great beat and Ed reveals a genuine affinity for playing the harmonica.<br />\\"Dirty Frank\\" is the only song I really have a complaint about.  For those unfamiliar with it, it is Pearl Jam's legendary tribute to the Chile Peppers and features lyrics about a serial killer bus driver.  However, it used to feature Ed at several points during the song riffing on \\"Shaft\\" (\\"That Dirty Frank is a bad mother...\\").  All of those moments are no longer in the mix, and that's a shame because they really added to the fun of the song and sort of defined it.<br />Finally there is \\"4/20/02\\", a hidden song that appears six minutes after \\"Bee Girl\\".  Written and performed by Ed the day that Layne Staley died, it is a raw and moving tribute to a lost friend, that reveals both anger and pathos.  A really powerful cut.<br />Unfortunately, I'm out of space and I've had to assume that tracks like \\"Wash\\", \\"Footsteps\\" and \\"Hard to Imagine\\" are already familiar.  If not, they're great too!<br />Enjoy!<br />Jake Mohlman
B00005JM0B|4.0|No this isn't T2, which completely exploded expectations. But it is very very close. Arnold is getting older yeah, but at least that whiny little b**** Furlong isn't in it! Nick Stahl steps in, and does an amazing job at the character. Claire Daines, well...she's beautiful... And I'm rambling.<br />Really, this is a worthy part of the T3 mythos for a few reasons:<br />1. How Skynet comes to fruition<br />2. The Terminatrix is decent<br />3. The ending is everything I expected and more<br />The extras are blah, but I really didn't care. The movie is worth the buy, for any techie.
B00005JM0B|3.0|First off, I am glad that T3 was finally made.  The movie itself has all the requirements for a Terminator movie:  fast-paced, non-stop action, a great story, apocalyptic conclusion, etc.  There are a few faults, in my opinion, that could have been avoided to make the movie flawless.   First off, there is way too much computer animation in the movie.  It seems like if a scene is going to have any amount of action in it, the CGI animators have a field day with it.  What I liked about T2 is that Cameron introduced a fairly new phenomenon, computer animation, but did not go &quot;overboard&quot; with it.  CGI was incoporated into areas of the movie where it was needed.  This brings me to my second fault:  the story.  The story is incredible, but it seems a bit rushed.  Cameron always takes his time with his movies, hence that is why they are epics (example Titanic, The Abyss, T2, etc).  I'm not saying that the movie should have been done by Cameron, but if the T3 director spent more time with developing the story, and not focusing on too much action and computer animation, all of the elements would have been balanced for a fantastic movie.  As predicted by T2, computers have become the downfall of man, and could possibly lead to our on Judgment Day.
B00005JMNY|5.0|soundtrack note: Great track with Macauly via megaphone processed Vocal!<BR>...But alas,,,having read James St. James's 'Disco Bloodbath' promptly upon it being published,  i could somewhat fill in the 'blanks' of the final film.<br />After all the years of being aware of these 'celebrities' and their escapades... ///especially those who used to read Alig's \\"Project X\\" mag/// , , , OR really, any of those who lived/worked in those \\"stylish subculture underground clubs\\" found in many metro areas during the oh-so-clever-and-gay 'Pre-Rave' club days will probably appreciate in some way this docu-dramatic \\"trip\\" into remembering the times back then ,,,<br /> I forsee that someday = likely around 2013 , the \\"Special edition Directors edition +plus+ \\" DVD(s) and soundtrack will be must-own-items for multitudes of new baby club creatures!
B000002JB8|5.0|The Vangelis' album will take you to heaven on earth.<BR>Got stressed, complicated, exausted, sick and tired of everyday life? <BR>The album 'oceanic' is my strong recommendation for anyone, who want relaxing, peace, and a humanic world from music listening.<BR>My favorite tracks are 'Sirens and whispering' and 'The song of the seas'.<BR>The 'Oceanic' is truly a deep peace of running wave that actually any normal listeners can feel and enjoy.
B00000099Y|5.0|First Tool CD i got was Lateralus, and i must say, after the first listen i was intrigued. This band was messing with my mind through their music. I decided to get another tool cd. I picked up Aenima, not knowing much about any of Tool other than that i liked Lateralus alot. Aenima is the most genius album ever made. The CD is insane. It is melodic, heavy, and, through its level of genius, absolutely heavenly. Tool CDs, ive found through personal experiences, NEVER GET OLD. I bet any one out there that in a year ill still be listening to Lateralus and Aenima, both of which are genius. Maynard is not limited to one band, either. No, he has decided to take on a side project. A Perfect Circle, which also rules quite a lot, has hit the top of the charts. He is now working on Tapeworm, a side project with TRENT REZNOR - another music God, from NIN. I bow to Maynard, and to Danny Carey, God of Drums. I can't wait till the next Tool cd. Can't wait to see what journey Maynard and pals take me on this next round...
B0000DJZA0|3.0|(CD 3 Stars; DVD 4 Stars).<br />Only 2 proper albums into their career, and already we receive a (sorta) greatest hits live album from Coldplay. The CD (12 tracks, 67 min.) covers familiar ground for anyone that saw Coldplay on the \\"Rush of Blood\\" 2002-2003 world tour, opening of course with the high energy \\"Politik\\". \\"See You Soon\\" (originally on \\"The Blue Room EP\\", the outstanding 1999 EP--still available, including from Amazon) is one of the highlights. \\"Shiver\\" is another, and reminds me why I like \\"Parachutes\\" so much better than \\"Rush of Blood\\". \\"Moses\\" is the only true new song on here, quite good actually. And of course the \\"hits\\" \\"In My Place\\", \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Clocks\\" are here.<br />In all, not a bad collection, but nothing that made me sit up and take notice. Unlike, say, the other live Coldplay collection \\"Trouble: Norwegian Live\\", a 5 song EP from a December 2000 show (still available, including here on Amazon), where Chris Martin works the Oslo crowd into a frenzy. Compare \\"Everything's Not Lost\\" on this EP against the \\"Live 2003\\" version and you'll see what I mean.<br />The DVD is quite nice, though. For one, it adds 5 more songs including three \\"hits\\" (\\"Don't Panic\\", \\"Trouble\\" and \\"The Scientist\\"), inexplicably left off of the CD version (which at 67 min. could have easily added them), and the show closer \\"Life is for Living\\". The tour diary is goofy fun but inconsequential. For Coldplay completists only.
B00008J4P5|5.0|this is the best album of the year if not the decade!!!!
B00005LC1H|5.0|Just like to say that Fawlty Towers has the sort of comedy that you either like or get worn out by. I personally find it hilarious, thats why i gave it 5 stars. However, some of us Brits found it tiring and just a racket (most didn't though). Having said that, you will not. I know you Americans like everything bigger and better. You will love this. This is the British - American comedy. BUY IT!
B00005JLYW|1.0|This must be the worst film of the year, if not the decade. The &quot;story&quot; is nonexistant, the acting - if you can call it that - (other than Diaz) is forced and plastic and the action scenes are so over-the-top that you look at them as think - 'Does gravity or the laws of nature exist in their world?' A great example is when one of the Angles jumps off a 3 story building and lands on her feet (high heels no less)- PLEASE......  This is worse than a bad MTV video and more like a kids cartoon (less any plot).
B00000251N|5.0|Jonathan Livingston Seagull is the sound of creation--the earth and the sea. And \\"Be\\" is a song about the creation of man and time. It is a masterpiece crafted by God through Neil Diamond as his conduit.  <br />Jonathan Livingston Seagull is about freedom; about an outcaste bird's soul searching journey and triumphant return to his flock with renewed personality, spiritual perception, wisdom and leadership qualities. It is a metaphor that can serve as a reference (and soundtrack) to our every day life's experiences. <br />Jonathan Livingston Seagull's music transcends style and category--it is music made for all seasons--undoubtedly timeless--truly captivating. It is immaculate. It is majestic--a true masterpiece. It is spiritually enriching--it is Divine.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|A friend turned me onto this recording. I was a huge Rush fan 20+ years ago. Have floated in and out of touch with their music since then. Then I heard this one. Words really fail me. Good renditions of the new stuff (One Small Victory -- very nice) and the old stuff (By-Tor -- cool!).<br />Highlights? Crowd singing along to YYZ. Spirit of Radio. One Small Victory. La Villa Strangiato. The crowd involvement really makes this an ejoyable listen.<br />Inspired me enough to pick up Vapor Trails and the recently remastered Permanent Waves.<br />Packaging and book of notes was really enjoyable, too.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Just say it yesterday. I would have to say that to those who have compared this to the Matrix, the two aren't even in the same league. It grabs your attention from beginning to end, and the storyline keeps you on edge. Definitely a must see....
B00005JM0B|1.0|In a bold move Director Jonathan Mostow has created a shot for shot remake of the James Cameron masterpiece Terminator 2: Judgement day.No wait...I've just been informed this is a sequel to that incredible film. It stars Arnold Schwarzeneggar returning for one last pay check from Hollywood before he goes off to become Governor in the fall of 2004. So what does this sequel have to offer those who have been waiting (or not) for a continuation to a story that frankly did not need continuing? A shameless rehashing of every idea James Cameron brought to T2. Two terminators come from the future, one to destroy John Connor, the other to protect him... blah blah blah. This is the younger more naive brother of T2. It's short and meaningless. The supposed rise of the machines is nothing but a quick shot of nuclear missles firing. Nothing compared to the Matrix Revolutions attack on zion, which was nothing short of spectacular. You've seen this all before folks. The street car chase scene. The new more advanced terminator morphing into loved ones after killing them. Lacking any kind of character or charisma on screen the terminatrix is just a pair of boobs that walk and kill. But a few questions come to mind. If the machines spent as much time fighting the war against man as they do going back in time to cowardly kill a child, maybe they could win the war in the future and end this madness. And if the future is NOT set than how come their so sure John will win the battle?Or if both sides can go back in time you figure one would have affected the future time and time again and just screw it up even more so. Instead of showing us a great war between man and machine they take us on the exact same journey as T2 just to get to a predictable ending. The special effects look like their out of a tv mini-series, and thats exactly what this felt like. Not a feature film, but a crappy tv mini series. It is pretty self evident this was not a story worth continuing. It has none of the emotional depth or drama of the matrix series. This is a lame series that should be put to sleep. Duplicating every joke and worthwhile scene does not make a good sequel. No new ideas or innovative action scenes were brought to the table. It seems that all the praise came simply from that fact that it wasn't a giant mess, but it wasn't anything great either. I cannot fathom all the great reviews for this, it's boring, and I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in theatres. But in the end, money IS good, hopefully some of us are smart enough to see past this cash cow.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Hanks, the clockwise FedEx officer finds himself as a 'fish-out-of-water' after one of the most realistic plane crashes you could imagine washes him up on a deserted, Pacific isle. The main bulk of the movie finds Chuck (Hanks) adjusting to spending 4 long years in solitary confinement on his 'prison' island.<br />Eventually he has enough and makes a daring venture on a makeshift raft in order to find freedom (or maybe just get off the island). He makes it but arrives home to find his fiancee has since remarried thinking he is dead. Solid viewing matter.<br />One thing I really wanted to know - what's in that package he never opens????
B00008976Y|4.0|I was actually told by several friends that &quot;Blue&quot; by Kieslowski was a &quot;boring&quot; movie, so unfortunately I avoided it as long as I could. That was a mistake.<br />This is not a &quot;boring&quot; movie at all. &quot;Blue&quot; may move slow, but that is because the so-called &quot;action&quot; takes place in the beginning minutes of the movie, while the remainder of the story traces one woman's ability to deal with that event, and our witnessing of her inner-trauma.<br />I disgree with my friends, who may need to take a reviewing of this wonderful movie. &quot;Blue&quot; is casted well. It is filmed even better. It has some cinematography that could be said to rival some of Kubrick's films. Of course, the color blue appears throughout the screen at various times and in several clever ways, but the real gem of the film in keeping in true &quot;Kubrick-esque&quot; style is the score. This movie makes excellent use of music, not just as a &quot;mood-setting device&quot;, but also as a narration and puntuation trigger, not altogether unlike things that we associate with Godard's films. I applaud this director's keen sense of how music can empower a scene and give it great depth and subtle meaning.<br />Film historian and author Annette Insdorf gives a valuable and insightful commentary track that will enhance your understanding, not just of this particular film, but of the Blue, White, and Red trilogy as well as the man Krzysztof Kieslowski himself, personally and professionally.<br />A wonderful DVD - with a behind the scenes documentary and a few extras as well. And of course, Juliette Binoche is simply beautiful here - pathos incarnate.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|This is a great album but Scenes by far is a better example of what Dream Theater are capable of if they put all there eggs in one basket and share the outcome.  <br />I've read some reviews that wonder where Johnny and Jordan are, well they are very much there.  Jordan is basically copying Petrucci note for note on some of those extended guitar licks, which in my opinion is quite amazing but a bit unnecessary.  There are also quite a few times where Jordan layers himself and does some amazing things.  JM rumbles through quite nicely, and with a closer listen I heard some really amazing basslines that go above and beyond.  The problem is that I needed headphones to hear all that.  The production is very good but you can hear that things are being mixed down a bit so others can break through.  <br />The thing with this album is that John Petrucci is blatanly trying to prove something he doesn't have to.  Let MP overplay we're used to it by now.  I think on Scenes he was fabulous.  He's always wanted to break out and totally go crazy, and now he has.  Good for him I guess but it does get a bit stale after a while.  To be in the ranks of a Satch you need to mix it up and do it all at once.  On Scenes he did that but here he is more like Slayer than anything else.<br />I give this 4 stars because of the overplaying by John, (and even some by Mike.  Long guitar solos into long drum solos...ummmmm.)  I don't really knock them because it's there artistic right to do whatever they feel and no musician should be confined to a typecast.  I do wish though that they would let, or encourage JM to go crazy and give a five minute bass/Stick solo that kicks ass because he is probably one of the best technical bass players around and is a really creative musician.  Keep doing those side projects Johnny M.      <br />I will say I hope Petrucci and Rudess and Portnoy can do all that soloing and dueling live.  That would be a truely amazing feet if you ask me.  <br />I will listen to this album for sometime because I really like the vocal performance by Labrie who I wish would get musical credit for his performance.  Keep doing those side projects James.  Also I like the heaviness of it.  The instrumental music is great and it compliments the lyrics well.  If you can get past the long up and down soloing by JP and even some overplaying by MP, this is a keeper.
B0000TB05A|5.0|The Packaging<BR>The first surprise is that the DVD is available in two different kinds of packaging. One version comes in the usual digipack-cover as we know it from the Boston DVD. Inside you find the booklet in the usual DVD upsize format. The second version, in contrast, comes in a suprising format: its a standard cd jewel case with a booklet in the same format. A pretty unusual format for a DVD and day-to-day customers might easily mix up this version with a normal audio CD.<br />The Content<br />The DVD contains the entire slane castle concert from September 1st. 'Mysterious Ways' is not part of the concert, but listed as a 'bonus track'. The reasons for this are still unknown. The concert without Mysterious Ways lasts 1:38h, the bonus track is 6:26 min long. Furthermore the DVD contains a remastered version of the 'Unforgettable Fire' Documentary, which has been available before on the 'The Unforgettable Fire Collection' VHS from 1985. Bonus-Features include the already mentioned Mysterious Ways track, a DVD-ROM section with screensavers, desktop wallpapers, an elevation tour calendar and weblinks, plus - for the the first time ever - the possibility to view 3 songs from the show in a 360° perspective.<br />The Concert<br />The most noticeable fact about this concert is the perfect mood the band was in on this evening. What seemed somewhat artificial and nervous in the Boston show, you can see much better here - the band enjoyed playing a second time in front of such a crowd at Slane Castle. Maybe it's the fact that it was not planned to release this concert for sale. Some incidents before the shows made both Slane concerts very emotional. The huge crowd brings a terrific spirit to the homes of all U2 fans, and the interaction with fans is much better here than in Boston.<br />Between songs Bono tells stories, plays games with fans and makes other kinds of jokes, all this makes the recording and U2 on this evening so likable. We pass on a song by song review, as we think that each viewer has to make up his own mind about this concert. We just want to point out that U2's mood and musical performance is outstanding. In comparision with all the other live videos this is the one which transports the feeling of a live concert best. All other videos tend to be stiff in some way or too well prepared. U2 at Slane Castle 2001 is the band U2 we want to see, they act with their hearts and have fun.<br />The Picture<br />The concert was recorded with many camera perspectives although Ned O'Hanlon said in an @U2.com interview that the expenses on that show were just a small fraction compared to the expenses for recording the Boston show. The spirit of the entire show is captured very well, shots from and of the audience are used very often and reflect its enthusiasm. The video format is 16:9, the pictures are sometimes very coarse, sometimes due to special effects, but this may have to do something with the light conditions during the shooting.<br />The Sound<br />This is the first time a U2 DVD is released with DTS sound, in addition to the PCM stereo format and DolbyDigital 5.1. But we think that for a normal user there is no relevant notable difference. Bonos voice is transferred very clearly via the centre speaker. The instruments are mixed to the front speakers, from the rear speakers you can notice quiet echoes, which are sometimes irritating. The audience is well mixed into the rear-speakers. There is no crystal clear mixing as can be found on DVDs like 'Eagles - Hell Freezes Over', where each instrument can be heard on a different channel. But maybe it's not comparable, because the Eagles show was a club-gig especially prepared for this, U2 in Slane was an open-air show which was, at the time of recording, not scheduled for a release.<br />The Extras<BR>'The Unforgettable Fire' documentary<BR>As mentioned before this is a remastered version of the 'Unforgettable Fire' documentary which follows the recordings of the album ofthe same name at Slane Castle in 1984. The video format is 4:3 and the documentary is 28 min long. The Documentary also includes the \\"Pride (In The Name of Love)\\" video. The picture quality is not the best, it's far away from DVD-quality.<br />Bonus-Track 'Mysterious Ways'<BR>Once the track list of the DVD became public, many fans were shocked as the same song which was already missing on the Boston DVD was once again cut out. For still unknown reasons the song was taken out of the usual running order of the DVD and instead placed as a bonus track. It is not as was rumoured (and feared) a so called \\"easter egg\\", but a normal track which can easily be accessed via the main menu. (Remark: Producer Ned O'Hanlon said in a recent interview that the song just didn`t really fit into the show).<br />DVD-Rom Bonus Tracks<br />The most anticipated special, the 360° view of the concert, ends up being a Quicktime video of the three songs Elevation, Beautiful Day and Where The Streets Have No Name. Users have the possibility to spin around 360° degrees in real time at the touch of their mouse. A real high-end-special-feature feeling unfortunately doesn't come across due to the lack of quality which reminds one of a cheap webcam.<br />The second special feature is the 'Elevation tour diary calendar and clock'.<br />Furthermore two screensavers in red and blue are available - their style matching the artwork of the DVD. Nice, but not really exciting.<br />Four desktop motives are available to polish up your Windows system. They are available in 1024x768 and 800x600 resolution.<br />Finally the obligatory links to U2.com and NGOs that are supported by U2 are featured. Exclusive weblinks are unfortunately missing.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|as a long time fan I have to say that this cd was not really worth the wait. music to do the ironing to. sadly on the strength of the tunes on this disc her fantastic voice will remain largely ignored here in the u.k.. stick with &quot;surfacing&quot;
B000099T2L|1.0|Beyonce...believe it or not, her name is not half as obnoxious as her image! She never sings live which should give you an idea of what this album is like. Every other song &quot;features&quot; a rapper which only serves to further crowd the cloned songs that now appear on the radio. Pass this over for Kelly's album , at least she has a voice, sings live and gets good rappers like Nelly.
0316666343|4.0|This book started off different than any other book I've ever read. On the first page I learned that Susie, the main character, was already dead.  It was very interesting how Susie looked down from &quot;heaven&quot; and saw all the people she loved go on with their lives.  There is one character in the book, George Harvey, who is totally sinister. He is an evil man who I despised as soon as I met him.  Alice Sebold's writing style leands itself to a fast read. Although the premise of the book is a bit out of the ordinary, the family's struggle after Susie's violent death seemed liek a realistic view of the after-math of a real-life tragedy.

B00005JMFR|4.0|....I sure enjoyed it.  A guilty pleasure like South Park or Beavis & Bu++head?  Maybe, but that doesn't detract from the plain and simple fact that I had a great time watching this movie and the entire trilogy.  They are movies, entertainment, and are not meant to give the meaning of life or be some quasi-religion, so some of you people really need to lighten up a bit.<br />Revolutions had its flaws, but overall was well worth the visit to see it on the big screen and will it be a DVD I purchase to round out my collection.  I went to see it in the theater knowing full well that it wasn't going to answer all the question raised in the previous movies, but you know what, that didn't matter.  There was a story here, and a good one.  One that kept me engrossed for the length of the film, expanded on the characters, and dazzled the eyes.  Sure, some of the parts of the film could have been streamlined or made a bit clearer, and the big finalie could have been even bigger (though believe me, it is big enough), but on the whole, Revolutions brought the trilogy to a satisfying and entertaining end.  It is an action flick, not a drama, so don't expect that level of depth when that is not what the film(s) set out to do.  As for the unanswered questions, I for one like going out for coffee afterwards and getting everyone elses take on things, and seeing what they think happened.  (ie.:  When agents took over a person, did that person die?)<br />This was a slick, cool, adrenaline packed series of movies, worth being taken as a whole, though the 1st will always be my favorite.<br />The Matrix - 5 stars, a real thinker with effects that were never before seen on the big screen.<br />Reloaded - 3.5 stars.  A good movie with even better special effects but relied a bit too much on the action and philosophical mumbo jumbo.  Really just an intro to ...<br />Revolutions - 4 solid stars.  There were some cliches and the Zion battle was just  a bit too intense for a bit too long, but those are minor things.  The special effects shine like never before (loved those rain effects at the end),  the characters were more real and developed,  and I left the theater feeling like I got my money's worth and pondering everything I had just experienced for the next few hours.<br />In the end, I think that is what really counts.  Thank you Wachowski brothers for giving us a good trilogy, not an easy thing to do.hose are minor things.

B00005JLTN|1.0|Reloaded is post ANIMATRIX where the crew of actors from THE MATRIX return for what would have been a great film. In the first film the story was great and involved some deep development into the plot. It did have some exciting fight scenes and effects that paved a new road for CG. It was also still based on partial laws of physics. Reloded is a completely different story.<BR>It seemed as though the film makers wanted to create the special effects industry all over again. By using very predictable CG it made the movie seem more like a cartoon then an action flic. The cheractors seemed to be invinceable from harm and be exempt from gravity and normal reality based physical laws. Neo could fly and take on countless phoes with ease which made the agents and mineons seem like much less of a threat, trinity could jump out a 65 story building, and morphious could battle on a truck at high speeds.....It just seemed so made up. If that is not enough, it contained some of the longest speeches i have ever herd. The machene who created the matrix (in the film) seemed so calm about the continuing murder and distruction that was taking place in his world. If he indeed desired perfection why would he let humans run amok leveling buildings and freeways. I was very stunned at the out of place and completely unnecessary rave/love scene. Not something that would normally be seen in an action film. <BR>All in all, the film is an insult to THE MATRIX and should be left on the shelf of the video stroe instead of on your own.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh's sophomore album is such a fantastic stride in this man's career!! Every track on this is beautiful, diverse, and extremely unique. Josh Groban needs to be congratulated on not only not fearing the sophomore slump, but kick it's a$$ at the same time!
B000007177|4.0|Instead of comparing the so-called \\"Chateau d'Isaster\\" suite on Disc #1 of Nightcap with A Passion Play, let's just say that the former has plenty of what Jethro Tull fans yearn for: loud and spirited playing, interesting musical progressions, inane yet strangely expressive and descriptive lyrics, fine acoustic playing, and vocals that leap and soar.  Does it work?  Yes, as a curiosity of what it might have become; no, as a coherent musical whole.  Much of it simply lasts longer than it has to, but much of it is still a treat in its own right.  I can see why it was abandoned as a commercial project; it was heading in no particular direction and even its creators couldn't figure it out!  I know I was certainly confused by it all.  For fans only.    Disc #2 presents many fine unreleased tracks, again displaying the qualities fans have come to appreciate.  Some of these tunes are obviously latter-day recordings as they display Ian Anderson's graveling and narrowing voice, but many are from the early-mid '70s when said voice was in full flower. The disc is chock full and can be summed up by saying that it would be much easier to list the lesser tracks than the better.  I believe all fans will love it!  Even the uninitiated might find something here to savor.    I would suggest to all, fans included, to find a used copy of this 2-CD set as the full retail price is a bit rich, despite the richness of the content.
B000089RVR|4.0|im 23 and i think dido has an unique voice and i think the melodies are beautiful her voice kind of reminds me of the cranberries. its a nice change from all the poppy mtv &amp; radio garbage. you can tell a cd by its cover by the style they sing so dont give her a bad review simply because you dont like the style of the music. why dont you atleast review the cd first before buying it. shes a great artist.
B00000AOUD|5.0|True confessions time, folks.  When this album was first released I was in high school.  I heard it in its entirety on my local \\"underground\\" FM radio station and was immediately taken by its inventiveness and complexity.  I picked it up soon after and played it endlessly for weeks. Call me a schmuck; call me a sucker; but I swallowed the Gerald Bostock canard hook, line, and sinker.  Hell, it even said it was written by Gerald Bostock in small print on the LP label!  It had to be true, right?  I read the faux newspaper account on the cover and was so captivated by the story of the \\"Little Milton\\" that I imagined Ian Anderson was actually singing words penned by a pre-pubescent prodigy.<br /><br />Now, is this my favorite album of all-time BECAUSE of my youthfully enthusiastic gullibility?  Well, if I could be so consumed by such a calculated ruse, then Jethro Tull and this album deserve my praise.  I explain it as akin to wanting to be scared at a horror movie.  The imagery evoked by the lyrics along with music never before heard on a pop record, as well as Anderson's ruse, make this album a milestone in recorded music history.<br /><br />Fast-forward over thirty years later: I laugh at my naivete of an earlier time.  I listen to this album and it still affects me.  Perhaps 'nuff said. Good one, Ian.  Thanks for the experience of hearing this music for the first time.  And thanks for the immaculate deception!
B0000DJZA0|4.0|First off, I love coldplay from there album &quot;Parachutes&quot;...  So of course I was eager to see what the live album was about...  So I did some research before buying it, and finally bought it yesterday...  The sound quality is excellent, the bonus dvd is awesome to say the least...  Almost like you were actually at the concert...  A awesome experience...  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is cuz the cd is missing songs from the dvd concert...  On the dvd you have 17 songs, and on the live cd, 12 songs...  I know, I know, they couldn't put them all on the cd cuz otherwise it would be a 90mins cd which doesn't exist yet...  Oh well...  Great work anyways Coldplay !  Can't wait for new material...
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Kelly did a great job with this cd. It shows her versatility like what she did on American Idol. Every song shows her strengths. You can hear the passion in her voice when she sings &quot;The Trouble With Love Is&quot;, &quot;Some Kind of Miracle&quot; and &quot;Anytime&quot;. You also get treated to another side of Kelly in the rock-style &quot;Just Missed the Train&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Disaster&quot; and &quot;Low&quot;. Also, Tamyra Gray adds attitude to the cd with a duet called &quot;You Thought Wrong&quot;. If you need a song to just sit back and chill to, listen to &quot;What's Up Lonely&quot; or &quot;Thankful&quot;. If you wanna be reminded of her power during American Idol, you've got &quot;A Moment Like This&quot; and &quot;Before Your Love&quot; on the cd, as well. It's an awesome cd and every song is a good song. Just like the cd title, I am THANKFUL that Kelly didn't stick to just one genre of music and showed what she can really do.
B00005JMGL|5.0|The previous reviewer, \\"a sixteen year old who already feels the effects of age\\" is looking forward to Peter Pan. So is this 46 year old who has never grown up and hopes that never changes.<br />Whatever your age, whatever your status, there is that part of you that never wants to grow up - and that is Peter Pan. Similarly, there is that part that DOES want to grow up, but still, still, doesn't want to have to obey the rules that don't belong, doesn't want to have the responsibilities, and isn't sure that the world is what it really should be - and that's Wendy. And finally, there's the part of you that wants to have no responsibilities, but all the fun, but still, if need be - to try to help - and that's Tinkerbell.<br />Berrie put together the archetypes that are within us all. I will be going to this movie in a strong longing and a strong anticipation - hoping that the makers of the film feel the exact same way - that such a movie reflects us all.
0312263120|3.0|Here's the problem: Digital Fortress has a good plot, but it's filled with weak characters.  I really liked the plot.  A disgruntled NSA employee develops an unbreakable encryption program (the Digital Fortress) and threatens to give both the encryption program and the key (which is buried in the program) away on the Internet. If the bad guys gain access to the key, they will be able to communicate without fear of the NSA decrypting their messages. This throws the NSA into a panic - as it should - so they send David Becker to track down the former employee.  However, David learns that the man has died in suspicious circumstances, so ... well, you know.<br />Pretty good so far, but now consider the main characters.  Susan Fletcher and David Becker are the perfect pair.  She's beautiful, intelligent, sexy and decent to the core.  He's beautiful, intelligent, sexy and - yes - decent to the core.  Although Susan has an IQ of 170, she's mostly eye candy.  The only surprise was that nobody tied her to railroad tracks in front of an oncoming train.  Although that might have improved her characterization.  David, on the other hand turns out to be the greatest daredevil of all time, outwitting a professional assassin, even though the most exciting thing he has done is to thrash an opponent on a squash court (and then treat him to a fruit shake and bagel).  There's another character known only as Jabba ... enough said?<br />Okay, so what's the bottom line?  This clearly isn't a top-level thriller, but if your plans fall through some weekend, this wouldn't be a bad book to pick up.
B0000004V2|5.0|In 1989, a band from Manchester, England named the Stone Roses released a self-titled album that became a smash in their homeland. Before Oasis, Radiohead and Coldplay came along, there were the Stone Roses, and they were a *phenomenon*. John Squire was an instant guitar-god, Ian Brown had a singing voice that could easily melt you, Gary Mounfield was a solid bassist, and the drummer known only as Reni was nothing short of fantastic. Oh yeah, and they also wrote fantastic songs, shimmering beauties that perfectly mixed rock, pop, funk, dance, psychedelia, and acoustic stuff. And all in one album! And although the Roses never got beyond cult status in the States, their self-titled debut remains a landmark album in British rock history. From the opening \\"I Wanna Be Adored,\\" \\"She Bangs The Drums\\" and \\"Elephant Stone,\\" to the halfway point of \\"Elizabeth My Dear\\" (all 59 seconds of it), \\"(Song For My) Sugar Spun Sister\\" and \\"Made Of Stone,\\" to the brilliant extended tracks of \\"I Am The Resurection\\" and the GROOVY \\"Fools Gold,\\" this album is a mindblower. As other reviewers have pointed out, every note played and sung is absolutely perfect. Sadly, when the promotional duties for the album were finally finished, the Stone Roses got tangled up in legal hassles with their record label, preventing them from releasing another album for five years. The second album, \\"Second Coming,\\" finally arrived in 1994, and it, too, was brilliant (and it was also the album that made me a Roses fan, t'boot), but it wasn't received anywhere near as well as the first album, and the band fell apart shortly afterwards. Their lifespan was much too brief, but ALL the current hot British bands of the day owe a great debt of some form or another to the Stone Roses for helping to forge the path with this all-time classic 1989 release.
B000001IQH|5.0|This CD is 19 songs full of the best Rancid songs.  Whenever I listen to this CD there is never a track I skip.  If you arn't a really big fan of Rancid and are looking to get into them more, this is definatly the CD to buy.  These songs, especially Root Radicals and War's End make me proud to say I'm a Rancid fan.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I first rented this movie out of curiosity not knowing if I would like it.  The story centers around Lee played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who comes out of a psychiatric hospital for a compulsion to self mutilate and hurt herself, on top of having to live in a home were her dad can be an ugly drunk and a hapless overly codependent mother played by Leslie Ann Warren .  Upon her release from the hospital she plunges herself into her secretarial school where she excels and upon completion of her studies she applies for a position with a small legal office with Edward(James Spader),a rather perfectionist and imperious lawyer who tends to run secretaries out of his office.  He observes her and in some ways helps her, but becomes rather severe over typos due to having no computers and typewriters being the only way to make documents.  <BR>At first he admonishes her then it graduates to spankings.  However once he knows of her self mutilation habit he orders her to stop to which she complies.  In a way it becomes a love story and who is to really say that love must always be soft and gentle and that submissibity and domination don't turn some people's cookie.  Won't give away more otherwise it gives away too much, it is different I will say that.
B00005JMFO|5.0|What a fantastic movie Love Actually is!  Don't miss it. The fun, the music, the nudity, the tears, the laughter.  Great acting by Hugh Grant and Liam Neeson.  Everyone shines!

0385504209|2.0|This book is actually quite depressing, because its popularity is based upon a readership fairly unfamiliar with Western history (and Western art history).  A few other reviewers are right on target in bringing up the fact that St. John is always portrayed as a \\"feminine\\" looking youth and that it is a real rookie move in art class to say \\"is that a girl in the painting with Jesus?\\".  Folks with any regard for St. John or Mary Magdalene or Leonardo or the Knights Templar or Constantine or Isaac Newton or Victor Hugo shouldn't read this book unless they are looking to raise their blood pressure.<br />Material in this book that hasn't been lifted from a legitimate source like \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" appears to have been copied from Fundamentalist comic books (\\"Constantine worshipped the sun god, and was not a Christian!\\").  Other parts are strangely New Age, touting the human nature of Christ and the pairing of the feminine and masculine in the Deity.  This book has the capacity to make almost every reader angry.  Why is it so popular?<br />If you want make-believe \\"conspiracy theory\\" history, read Ishmael Reed's \\"Mumbo Jumbo\\", which is at least presented as a joke.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|Just get it. I have been enjoying DVD-Audio for the last year yet there were many titles I wanted in the SACD catalog so I recently purchased the Pioneer DV-563AS, a DVD player that will play back both DVD-Audio and SACD yet costs under 200.00. The Deluxe edition of Tommy simply sounds fantastic when playing the SACD 5.1 mix, the difference between it and the regular layer using a normal CD player is quite significant. Although I will admit to being prejudiced as Tommy is one of my all time favotite albums, this new version is simply superb, I am such a believer in the new high bit rate/sampling rate and 5.1 formats. It is amazing how good a near 35 year old recording can sound. Even if you don't have an SACD player this disc is very much worth getting, the stereo mix is excellent, you get a bonus disc with 17 additional tracks and the packaging is excellent, very high quality.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|This is P!nk's best album....She totally blew me away. I wasnt sure if i should get it at first but then i did and it just takes you away. I listened through it the first time and i loved it. Trouble,God Is A Dj, Last To Know, Humble Neighborhood, and Waiting For Love are my favorites. I was listening through 'waiting for love' and i was about to skip it. And just i was about to, the chorus came on and i was like whoa.....She was singing like a f*cking singer.....Her voice is so awesome. So Waiting For Love is my fave...The dvd is good to. I recomend this cd very much to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is just amazing. The lyrics are great, and the structure is perfect. Very clever songs that go together extremely well. This is A Perfect Circle at its best. If your a fan of Mer De Noms, or any tool album, this is a must buy.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Some of the Linkin Park reviews on this website are ludacris.  Linkin Park has a sound all their own.  Chester's vocals are amazing, and Mike has a distinct rap style.  To compare this band to Limp Bizkit is idiotic.  Limp Bizkit has the worst singer/rapper in the biz.  Fred Durst cannot hold a candle to Chester Bennington.  Chester Bennington's vocals remind me of the young James Hetfeild from Metallica.  Even though the songs are short, they are all trememdous pieces of art.  The guitar riffs are not plain, and a person has to be extremely talented to play their music.  This band is probably the most talented rock band right now. This band deserves more credit than they are getting on this website!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|The title to a song on the 2nd CD can resume the album. It's hard to imagine that these guys could get any better. But again they surprise you. A collection of songs lost among tapes and albums that now deserve (very rightly) their own album. Ranging from the early days until Riot Act these songs will blow you away. &quot;Leavin Here&quot;, &quot;Hold On&quot;, &quot;Fatal&quot;, the classic &quot;Footsteps&quot;, are some examples how music can be expressive in emotions, feelings, and how 5 guys can make great music. Definetly a must in any collection.
B0000CC5CS|3.0|Too bad James Cameron sat out on this one,....it could have been great. First off, the movie was somewhat entertaining, provided by Arnold and the mega-star that he is. But there were alot of problems......first of all, the missing links(edward furlong, linda hamilton, james cameron)in this movie foretold its future, straight to popcorn heaven.If I wanted to make T3 and Cameron would not direct it, I would stop right there. If ed furlong was unavailable to reprise his role as &quot;john connor&quot;, I would stop right there. But the brains behind this movie took an action classic and turned it into kid fluff with no depth to the script and too many one-liners. Arnold is THE ONLY reason to watch this movie.
B0000CAQ26|4.0|I love Pink. She's feisty, fun, sincere, and a risk taker. She's got a great voice, and she's smart enough to find talented collaborators who share her musical vision.<br />On \\"Try This\\", Pink ventures even further into bona fide rock chick territory than she did on \\"Missundazstood\\", enlisting Rancid's Tim Armstrong to write and produce a big chunk of her album. However, Pink refuses to have to choose between her diverse influences, so there're still sprinkles of R&B, blues and punk throughout the CD. \\"Trouble\\" and \\"Try Too Hard\\" are catchy, straightforward rock songs. \\"Oh My God\\", featuring vocals from  indie rapper Peaches, crackles with sincere sexuality. \\"Waiting For Love\\" finds Pink wailing longingly like Janis Joplin (surprisingly effectively). In \\"Humble Neighborhoods\\", a punk anthem, Pink touts the musical superiority of the underprivileged. Strangely, one of the best songs on the album is \\"Hooker\\", which is hidden after the last track. In it, Pink sounds downright hardcore as she sneers \\"You ain't nothing but a hooker ... selling your f$&%ing soul.\\" I wonder if she's talking about anyone we know?
B000066NW0|1.0|hey yeah u guys avril is really cool! to those who dont care what is happening to the &quot;punk&quot; name: okay, maybe ppl should lay off imposers but only if she would let ppl come up with their own impression.  she keeps telling ppl who she is and how she is so punk and hardcore.  if she truely was a punk, would she need to tell ppl that? who is there to convince if she really is. and i am sure a true punk wouldnt even bother to label themselves. wow this cd really sucks and even if she wasnt such a poser, her songs are lame and pop sucks!
B00005NWLO|5.0|Across the Atlantic you have The Who's \\"Live At Leeds\\" & The Stones \\"Get Your Ya-Ya's Out\\"; but here in the good ole USA, there is only one band that has ever recorded a live album to rival their British counterparts overseas. Yes, Lynyrd Skynyrd.  Ronnie Van Zant was one of the best front men on the planet...add a triple \\"mule\\" guitar attack, a killer rhythm section, 150% kick your @ss attitude and this album is the result.  No need to get into specific songs, just let me say they have never sounded better.  Plus you have 2 discs worth with the Deluxe release.<BR>If you can put all the retreaded \\"greatest hits\\" releases in the back of you mind, you will never grow tired of this album.  My only minor beef is the mixing of the guitars.  Rossington's guitar is front and center; considerably louder in the mix than Collins (left channel) & Gaines (right channel).  There are times when Gaines' guitar is barely audible.  It is not until \\"T For Texas\\" we can really here Gaines with any volume.  <BR>  I remember back in the 70's a friend of mine saying the Eagles were the best American band ever.  Ha...Skynyrd is the Eagles on  Jack Daniels & steroids....no comparison.  Add to cart now, you won't regret it!
0898705525|5.0|GK has a way of bringing up ideas that seem revolutionary at first blush, but upon explanation wind up being obvious.  Indeed, in his introduction, he describes his own spiritual journey that way: he likens himself to a British explorer setting sail in his yacht who winds up discovering England. He begins by explaining the limitations of reason, pointing out that men go mad not by losing their reason, but by losing everything except their reason.  GK says poets seek to get their heads into the heavens, but rationalists seek to get heaven into their heads.  This latter process can (not must) lead to madness.  Next, GK considers the leading philosophies of his day-pragmatism, determinism, and Nietzche's theory of Will-in light of this excessive rationalism.  He sums up neatly: \\"A man was meant to be doubtful about himself, but undoubting about the truth; this has been exactly reversed. Nowadays the part of a man that a man does assert is exactly the part he ought not to assert himself. The part he doubts is exactly the part he ought not to doubt -- the Divine Reason.\\"  On the ensuing pages GK shows how Christianity alone provides the key for how one is to live.  A few aspects of his arguments struck me as exceptional.  His arguments are eminently reasonable, not mystical appeals to faith.  His arguments consider the whole of man, from the broadest possible historical, psychological, and political perspectives.  His arguments are balanced: he is unafraid to point out the weaknesses of his position and the strengths of another.  Finally, his arguments are imbued with a gentility, humility and lightheartedness that are sorely lacking in our public debate.  It is a rare thing to be persuasive on questions of religious belief and morality; GK not only manages to pull it off, he provides a few chuckles in the bargain.
B000001EKX|4.0|This is the worst produced Kiss albums of all-time. No remastering can salvage the muffled sound on this release.   That being said, it also contains some of Kiss's best songs \\"Parasite\\", \\"Goin' Blind\\", \\"Let Me Go Rock & Roll\\" to name only a few.  In fact there is not a weak song on the entire album. This album arguably contains the best songwriting from Kiss ever.   Ace Frehley establishes himself as one of the eras best guitarist (despite the fact his solo fizzles into oblivion on the title track).  After repeated listenings, the sound grows on you; and you can compensate for the lack of fidelity by turning it up louder!  Excuse me while I go spin my vinyl copy I bought back in  '74.  Ace Frehley lead guitar!
0385504209|5.0|I read Da Vinci Code first and liked it so much that I proceeded to read three other books by Brown: Digital Fortress, Angels and Demons, and Deception Point. I've loved every one of them! Brown writes books that are so good, you find you are setting aside everything else until you finish them. He is a suspenseful writer, holds your interest, and is enticing enough with his 'facts' that you're willing to suspend disbelief. Every one of his books leaves you satisfied and ready to read another. If you haven't become acquainted with this author yet, you're in for a treat!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Yo, I just got the new album, and I must say I miss the softer stuff, but if I wanted to hear soft stuff I could just listen to an older album. Now here is a song by song review:<br />As I Am: This song was the obvious single on the CD. An absolutely blazing solo punctuates the song, and a catchy (yet heavy) chorus leaves you satisfied.<br />This Dying Soul: The Glass Prison Part 2! The 2nd heaviest song on the CD, this one features JLB singing in a quasi-Slipknot style (it's really not THAT bad...) and another great solo.<br />Endless Sacrifice: My favourite on the CD. Reminds me a bit of Metallica's &quot;Sanitarium&quot;, because of how it builds up to the chorus. Also, you can't help but laugh during the &quot;cartoonish&quot; synth interlude<br />Honor Thy Father: The heaviest song on the CD (on any CD!). JLB, screaming? Whoa!<br />Vacant: Finally I get to rest my ears... <br />             for a scant 3 minutes!!!<br />Stream Of Consciousness: I love the melody of this song. The solos are blazing (as usual) and as an instrumental, the song is not weighed down with subject matter. (Note the melody is exactly the same as &quot;Vacant&quot;, they do this on every CD)<br />In The Name Of God: Another good epic from the band. Heavy and soft. Ends the CD pretty well.<br />Obviously, This is an Excellent CD, but this album alienates some fans, but I could see some new fans coming from this CD.
B00005JKZV|5.0|My husband and I are at least on our 20th time (and counting) of experiencing this amazing movie.  The details are so rich that each time something new is revealed/exposed.<br />Can't wait to see the trilogy.  Thank you PJ/crew for your heart and soul.
B000099T2L|3.0|I've been a fan of Destiny's Child for years, and I was eager to hear Beyonc's solo debut album. Well, I have to say that at first, I wasn't too impressed by the songs (I was already tired of hearing Crazy in love 50 times a day on the radio by the time I got the whole album). But it slowly grew on me, and now I can listen to it every day. Dangerously in love cleary marks B's passage to womanhood : she's aware of her sexiness more than ever, and if she kind of repressed it while with DC, she now uses it to the fullest. She's not afraid to show off her \\"bootylicious\\" bod and sing sexually-oriented lyrics in a breathy, sultry voice that makes you feel like you're in a bedroom with her. Whether or not all of this is a good thing, I'm not sure. Beyonc sure has a gift for catchy songs, which she sings in a powerful voice without oversinging them unlike other pop divas we know (you listening, Christina???). But damn, does she have to sing about making love, being in love, being with the one she loves, then making love some more all the time?? She may have just discovered the \\"joys\\" of womanhood with bf Jay-Z (by the way, enough of those duets! We know you love each other, just get over it!!), but apart from Me, Myself and I, where are those self-empowerment songs that she used to be so fond of? In my opinion, she needs to add more depth to her writing (Signs is catchy as hell, but a song about astrology?? I mean, come on!! And don't even get me started on that sappy, crappy, cheesy tribute to her daddy!). Overall, great album, catchy songs, superb vocals... but please B, do us all a favor and try working on your subject matters for the next one, kay?
B00005JL96|5.0|Great movie. My daughter, who was almost 2 when she fell in love with it, loves it as to my husband and I. The only downfall I caught was that my daughter now licks mine and my husbands arms (Lilo licked her sisters arm when she caught her to ask her why she acted the way she did) when we're trying to talk to her. She also learned to throw herself face down on the floor and mumble unaudiable words when she did something wrong (also a scene when Lilo's sister tried to talk to her about the way she did when the Social Worker visited). She started throwing all her toys in the center of her room and growl stomping through them, throwing them up in the air and screaming (Stitch built the town in Lilo's room and then &quot;destroyed&quot; it). I just found it to be influencial - and not in a good way. <BR>We took the movie away for about 3 months and slowly reintroduced it to her, explaining (while watching the movie)that Lilo was being a baby and that she was whininng because what she did was bad. Also telling our daughter that Stitch was behaving badly. <BR>**Now she can point out when Stitch does something in the movie that my husband and I do not approve of.
B00008H2LB|4.0|After the remix CD Reanimation, Linkin Park returned in 2003 with their second proper album in Meteora. This is another good offering from this excellent<BR>nü-metal band which establishes its strength and importance in the genre. There are several great songs on this album which make it a highly enjoyable listen. However, I wouldn't give it 5 stars because there are a few songs that are not really worth listening to.<br />1. Foreword - 0/0 - Not a song.<BR>2. Don't Stay - 5/5 - A great opening song. Guitar and bass transitions sound good with heavy distortion. Great chorus with singing and some shouting from Mike.<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong - 5/5 - The first single and a brilliant song. Slow to mid tempo. Mike's rapping in the verses goes well with Chester's singing in the chorus. Contains some nice sampled effects too.<BR>4. Lying From You - 5/5 - Another great song. Strange beginning, and then the bass comes in sounding good. Good shouting in the chorus from Chester.<BR>5. Hit The Floor - 3/5 - Contains some strange sounds at the start. Screaming in chorus is okay, nothing special. The first song that is worth skipping.<BR>6. Easier To Run - 4/5 - A lighter, emotional song, especially at the start. The chorus is good, and Chester sings well in the verses too Similar to Crawling, but slightly better.<BR>7. Faint - 4/5 - The second single and another good song. Goes off at a fast tempo and Mike's rapping in the verses blends in well with Chester's singing/shouting in the chorus.<BR>8. Figure.09 - 5/5 - Another very good song. Good sampled introduction leading into another transition between guitar and bass with distortion. Thoughtful verses and a highly singable chorus.<BR>9. Breaking The Habit - 3½/5 - Another emotional song from Chester but faster than Easier To Run. Good singing. However, quite slow and loses interest.<BR>10.From The Inside - 5/5 - The last single and a great, heavier song. Unique 6/8 tempo. Verses are light with both Chester and Mike playing apart. Excellent chorus. Good breakdown with screaming too.<BR>11.Nobody's Listening - 3/5 - A slightly different sounding song, with a Japanese flute and hollow toms. Very hip-hop-ish verses. Chorus is okay but the song might be worth skipping.<BR>12.Session - 2/5 - A rather poor instrumental. Quite a disappoint compared to Cure For The Itch on Hybrid Theory, with no different parts and some unpleasent sounds. Poor ending too.<BR>13.Numb - 4/5 - The third single and a decent conclusion to the album. Emotional singing from Chester in the verses and some good light shouting in the breakdown. Piano sounds good. Similar to Pushing Me Away, the last track on Hybrid Theory.<br />Overall, a very good album from Linkin Park with just a few negative points. The band have already began work on their next album, due out some time in 2004. It should be interesting to see what it is like - if it retains the so far successful formula of this album and Hybrid Theory or if it goes off in some different directions. Either way, it should be good.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|IT'S A FACT NOW. IRON MAIDEN ARE THE ONLY BAND IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW WHO CAN PLAY MANY CHORDS WITH THEIR POWERFUL LYRICS TO MAKE U CRAZY. THE TIME I GOT THE ALBUM I LISTENED TO IT 5 TIMES IN A SINGLE DAY ITSELF.SUCH IS THE PACE OF THESE DUDES WHO TRULY DO THINGS WITH THEIR HEART AND SOUL. NONE OTHER THAN MAIDEN HAS NE BAND COME CLOSER. TOM MORELLO FROM AUDIOSLAVE CAN PLAY ONLY A FRACTION OF WHAT THESE PEEEPS CAN. SO GO AHEAD BUY THIS CLASSIC MASTERPIECE. BRUCE DICKINSON'S VOICE MAY SOUND OLD BUT IT REALLY STANDS TO BE A MIND BOGGLING ALBUM IN THE 21TH CENTURY. I HOPE THEY MAKE MORE STUFF LIKE THIS FOREVER !!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKC3|1.0|Spiderman was great.  Daredevil was passable.  But the Hulk is something else entirely.  I'm sure Ang Lee was trying to make this film seem thoughtful and deep, but he came a lot closer to mere incoherence.<br />We start out with lots of images of fancy lab equipment and mysterious experiments, then add in a bunch of mysterious, incomplete character images.  If it weren't so damn boring, it might have pigued my interest.  We all know that the Hulk's coming, but how do the pieces fit together?  At least thayt's what I might have thought if there had been anything to make me care. Instead, I just wished they'd get on with it.  And when they finally do get the big green guy on the screen, there was nothing good enough to redeem the lost time.  In fact, even the Hulk sceens got pretty monotonous after a while.<br />Oh yeah--  The split screen thing to give it a comic book look was a nice idea, but it didn't work at all.  It's just gives me another reason to want to turn it off.<br />There's a whole disc full of special features, but by the time I'd finished the movie, I really didn't care to watch them.  <br />Maybe hard core Hulk fans would like this movie, or maybe they'd be disgusted with the blown opportunities.  I don't know.  But I'm pretty sure that most everyone else would be much happier watching something else.  Even something with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.
B00006CXXU|1.0|this album was horrible! Britney is soooo much better. Christina is so talentless and this album proves her lack of talent. All she does on this album is b!tch and complain about her problems and all the vocals are horrible! She OVERSINGS everything and that ruins it. &quot;Im OK&quot; and &quot;Soar&quot; are the worst songs ive heard in my life.
B000089CKH|5.0|One of the best albums of 2003.  Let Go moves between poppy, catchy, shoegazer, and haunting, and back again (with a little french thrown in for good measure).  \\"Blonde On Blonde\\" stands out as the song you can't help but sing along with.  \\"Neither Heaven Nor Space\\" is an ethereal tune - the line \\"you can hear ghost trains\\" isn't just a lyric - it's true, you can.  \\"Inside of Love\\" paints a vivid picture in your mind - for anyone who has gone home with someone just to wake up knowing you're no closer to love, this song makes sense and brings a smile cloaked in a twing of sadness.  These 3 songs could carry the album on their own, but the entire album is a great listen.    Nada Surf has come a long way from Popular and the mediocre surf rock they'd produced earlier in their career.  This album is a strong effort.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I LOVE this album!! Its amazing! But &quot;In The Zone&quot; is sooooo much better!! I LOVE YOU BRITNEY!!!!!
B0000019PA|4.0|This is an album I bought solely on the recommendation of amazon.com and the few reviews I read.  If you are willing to buy an album solely for this reason, I believe it to be a risk worth taking if you are thinking about buying this album.  I bought it today and instantly liked it.  I actually began to feel better the moment the disc started playing.<br />It is difficult to describe this album to anyone who never heard it (yes, I realize how dumb that sounds).  The amazon reviewer is correct in comparing it to Alice in Wonderland.  This album creates its own world and operates with only its own internal logic.  Aside from that I do not even know how to begin to describe this album.<br />&quot;Free-spirited and silly with an acoustic guitar spine&quot; comes to mind.<br />  I found myself racking my brain trying to figure out who  they sound like. I caught momentary whiffs of Beck's acoustic work on &quot;Mellow Gold&quot; and maybe just a dash of the Beta Band. I caught myself thinking about Zappa once or twice, but that might just be because of the vegetable references. To be perfectly honest I think many people will hear many, many influences.<BR> <BR>So to recap: love this album, worth the risk, don't know what it sounds like, not 5 stars because it's a 4-star album (don't ask me why . . . it just is).<br />Oh yeah and I love the artwork-- kind of Nick Drakish Pink Moonish.
B0000CD5I6|3.0|I just purchased Jethro Tull's Christmas Album. I read all of the Amazon reviews prior to the purchase and, unfortunately, was a bit disappointed after a full listening of the disc. The material is good, and very familiar, as almost half of the songs had been released sometime earlier. As I listened to &quot;Ring out solstice bells&quot; and &quot;Fire at Midnight,&quot; it just seemed that the beat was a little off and the newer renditions sounded just a little tired. I then took out my Songs from the Wood CD and confirmed my initial impressions. The energy and brilliant creativity from Songs from the Wood is somehow missing on the identical tracks included in this newer collection. I know that this may be an unfair comparison--we all look and act differently than we did in 1976/1977. But I just couldn't shake the comparison. Ditto with &quot;Weathercock&quot; and &quot;Bourie.&quot;  The Christmas songs are not over-the-top and overall I think this is a solid Tull offering. I certainly don't regret buy it. Ian and the band continue to show me that their best stuff happens on stage and this year's tour was no exception. Finally, I need to put in a plug for Martin Barre's new album Stage Left. I added this disc on a whim. This CD is really, really good!! If you like Martin's &quot;A Winters Snowscape&quot; on the Christmas Album, you will be awed by a full collection of his work.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I have been a DT fan for only 1 year, but I really like all of their CDs. ToT is definitely their worst from my perspective. I like many forms of music, but abusive metal (both lyrically and musically) is pretty useless to me. I've been there, done that. DT used to make metal for people who do not like metal. Hopefully, their future albums will not be in this same vein. I like it when DT leans more towards Copland than their newfound heroes Metallica. Btw, I have listened to Master of Puppets at least 100 times, and it never did anything for me. Why the DT guys like it so much, I have no idea. <BR>   There seem to be 2 different camps of DT fans: those that say &quot;the heavier the better&quot; and those that prefer the progressive, sometimes softer, side of the band. I'm firmly in the progressive camp. The reason I like DT in the first place is because they are so different from metal bands. Metal bands will never write songs like &quot;Learning to Live&quot;, &quot;Through Her Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Lines in the Sand&quot;. Songs like those are poetic, show compassion, and convey a sense of hope even in despair. Bands like Metallica, Pantera, and Slayer are too shallow, and think if music is not angry and heavy, then it's 'girly'. The only statement they know how to make with their music is &quot;I will dominate you&quot;. What a worn out concept. I've heard it a million times and I am sick of it, to be honest. <BR>  &quot;Just Let Me Breathe&quot; poked fun at the &quot;angst-ridden posture&quot;, but now DT is taking on one themselves. They used to write music that could be called &quot;beautiful&quot;, but they must not like that word anymore. I hope John (the best lyricist) and Jordan will contribute on that one. JP's lyrics are getting more and more average. BTW, they should leave the obscenities for other artists to spit out, DT is too intelligent and tasteful for that.
B00009TB5G|1.0|I'm a bit confused.  If the original theatrical release was 179 minutes and this version is 208 minutes, how can they say they've added over 40 minutes of footage.  Have they edited some stuff out as well?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Never mind their network was built on the backs of shows like the X-Files; FOX, is all about reality television, (Really now, Joe Millionaire is Reality?) hokey action shows, (like 24) plus some T & A shows, (like the also cancelled: Birds of Prey and Fastlane), and not quality television.  Joss Whedon, famous for his clever writing on shows like Buffy, Angel, and several movies was the creative force behind Firefly.  This was to be a different type of Sci-Fi show. He presented us with a realistic view of our possible future, a contrasting viewpoint, from the overly optimistic, Star Trek series.  If it looked like a western, it was because Terraforming other planets, would be a lot like the pioneering days of the old west.  <br />Joss presented us with a future time without particle weapons, transporters, and without alien races.  If you think about it, then you'll see the logic in that.  Aliens are still rumor, and even if they do exist, they seem to hide themselves from us (in some sense can you blame them).  Particle weapons would take an unlikely leap in technology, and expense, (and government policy changes) to be handed over to the layman for his personal use.  Transporters, well it's just not set that far in the future!  The FOX executives, (suits) basically seem to believe we are all morons.  They thought the pilot was much too complex to be understood, (for us feeble minded morons) so it became the last episode broadcast, instead of the first.  Hopefully, they will put these in the correct order on the DVDs, and not in their broadcast order.<br />The pilot had the Firefly, (which refers to the cargo ship they fly) landing on a large city- like settlement.  It reminded me of the sets of Blade Runner, the combination of old versus new technology was quite striking, and very well done.  Like Blade Runner you had a mixed blend of races, with a prominent Oriental presence.  Missing, (since it was a settlement on a different planet or moon) was the non-stop darkness, (it wasn't totally polluted as yet) and relentless rain that characterized the Blade Runner movie.  The pilot had a good combination of plot, character development, and action to help you relate to the story.  The episode FOX chose to show instead of the pilot was weak by comparison.  The Sci-Fi Channel does not seem to recognize a good thing when they see it, and passed on picking this up when FOX dropped it. Instead they spend good money developing proven, past turkeys, like Battlestar Galactica.  Give me a break!<br />The cast on this show was very diverse, but seemed to work well together.  They had the right blend of fellowship, conflict, tension, and personal agendas to keep it interesting.  There was a slowly unfolding mystery, in the unknown origin, of some of the passengers.  Some members of the crew were loyal to the highest bidder, and others crew kept their agendas hidden for reasons all their own.  Joss, (the shows creator) generally has a master plan for each one of his seasons. His stories build to a big payoff in the end, and he does not practice cliffhangers.  I'm sorry this one did not get a chance to play out.  He does say he'll try, and resurrect it one day.  I still wish FOX could have completed one full season at least.  Their decision to cancel this, and replace it with a relocated freshman series had a further effect on their programming.  Fastlane, the replacement in the Friday early time slot, probably cost them the higher rated show that followed, John Doe.  I believe this because it makes too much sense that the Sci-Fi audience, would be more likely to stay around, and watch John Doe than fans of Fastlane.  In the end, FOX lost all three shows.<br />Nathan Fillian plays the captain of this group, and seems to be your classic hero type on the surface.  You forget sometimes he's really a smuggler.  He is tough without being a Rambo, and a lot smarter than he lets himself appear.  He has a few trusted crew, and some perhaps not so trustworthy, but otherwise very useful in a fight.  The Firefly crew would probably be doing honest work, if it would pay the bills. Instead a little smuggling, and some outright theft, is the way they make ends meet.  I believe the questionable ethics explored here would have made for lots of interesting episodes, had the show continued.<br /> The crew of the Firefly is not totally bad or good, but perhaps better than most.  The captain's cynical nature, (and probably his criminal ambitions) is forged in a past time, which is detailed at the beginning of the pilot. Diversity is nice in the members of the crew; they have a tough girl, a cute techie type, and a worldly type (actually a socially acceptable high-class space prostitute) with some political connections.  Plus one of the passengers is a mysterious girl, with perhaps unknown, mental powers.   The male crew is made up of a pilot, a tough guy, and among the male passengers a preacher, and a doctor, who is brother to the mysterious girl passenger.   <br />As I mentioned before, some episodes after the pilot are a little weak.  Probably they will play better after knowing the story from the pilot.  After that, the episodes will get progressively stronger.  The production values on this show are excellent, as are the special FX visuals.  The ship design is interesting, and it makes for some cool special FX graphics, especially in the pilot.  The price of the DVD set is pretty good considering the many hours of entertainment you get for it.  If FOX includes the unaired episodes, you could hardly find a better bargain!  I can't comment on extras or sound yet since it hasn't been released.
B00005RIKD|3.0|I'm a fan of &quot;Sting&quot;, and like almost everything he's ever done with &quot;The Police&quot;, and solo, but this seems kind of blah. The song selection is fine, but the re-working of these live songs just makes me realize how good the originals are. Some may really love this for the simpler arrangements, and almost jazzy feel, just not I. Now again, this isn't bad, but I'd rather listen to &quot;Fields Of Gold 1984-1994&quot; anyday.
B00005JM02|5.0|I'm a collector and avid fan of anime, and most animation in general.  What makes finding Nemo so good, is taking a simple story, and creating an adventure from it?  Nemo is a young clownfish; his father is over-protective due to a past tragedy.  The focal point of the adventure is with Nemo's father Marlin, and his quest to find his son.  Like most good adventures, the lessons learned along the way change Marlin in many ways he doesn't even realize.<br />This animation is so much a standout; it would be a good test for the top of the line plasma screens.  Rarely does an animation sport such vibrant colors, and get away with it, while not looking totally fake.  I sometimes have a problem with Ellen DeGeneres, (who plays the sometimes helpful fish, Dora) sounding too annoying when she acts.  In fact, Albert Brooks often comes off this way in some of his work as well.  It's funny to have him reel her in, ( no pun intended...maybe :) ) when she's getting a little bit too distracting. All in all, her performance is much better when it's a bit understated, and it is in this movie.<br />To help aid the overall story, Pixar created a secondary story for Nemo, that story has him tested through some interesting experiences of his own. He rises to meet the challenge, and his own personal journey serves him well in the end.  Movies like this are for children of all ages, from six to sixty, and beyond.  I missed this at the theater, and I'm really sorry now I did.  On the big screen this must have been quite amazing, even on my little 24&quot; TV set it looks great.<br />If you have the THX surround sound full treatment, the DVD includes special set-up tests for the video, and the surround sound speaker array. The menus on the DVD are some of the easiest I've seen to navigate.  You can even choose a virtual aquarium for display on your TV screen.  Sound is nice, and appropriate, although nothing earth shattering or Oscar worthy.  Despite some early tragic moments, young children should have no problem digesting this picture.
B00000DHZJ|4.0|This is almost identical to the older &quot;Ultimate Experience&quot; collection, but for some reason that's out of print. Some songs missing here are &quot;Burning Of The Midnight Lamp&quot;, &quot;Highway Chile&quot;, and &quot;Long Hot Summer Night&quot;. But in exchange this has &quot;Bold As Love&quot;, &quot;Freedom&quot;, and the excellent &quot;If 6 Was 9&quot;. Of course this also includes &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;Castles Made Of Sand&quot;, and the classic &quot;Voodoo Child (slight return)&quot;, among many others. My two favorites would probably be &quot;Little Wing&quot; and &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;. The only track I really miss is &quot;May This Be Love&quot;. Otherwise, this is about as good as one disc could be. The best thing about this &quot;Best of&quot;, is that it'll go great with your &quot;Eric Clapton&quot;, or &quot;Lenny Kravitz&quot; cd's.
B00005JMFR|3.0|You know the way I felt after I saw this movie is exactly the same as when I saw Alien 3, very disappointed.  The whole thing felt rushed and seemed more of an after thought.  But I am surprised about the similarities between the two franchises (Alien and The Matrix) as far as how the directors treated their material. Like the first movies was about mystery and lots of questions the second was about action and surviving and the last one was a disaster!  I can expect that the next Matrix movie would be all about redeeming the mistakes made in the last movie like alien 4 did.  But should you see it? I think yes just to finish the whole thing.  Maybe time will improve the movie especially when watch back-to-back with reloaded but who knows?  As far as I'm concerned I'll still love the first two just like in the Alien series and I'll just leave it at that.
B000005JA8|1.0|Wow, this album is one of the most divisive I've ever heard. Nobody thinks that Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica is simply \\"okay.\\" Most of the reviews on this page either dismiss it as contrived, deliberately atonal, pretentious trash, or think it's a work of genius, and naturally both crowds are antagonistic towards each other.<br /><br />So let me clear this up: You are not necessarily an MTV-watching mainstream drone for hating this album. By the same token, enjoying Trout Mask Replica hardly makes you a Mensa member (that said, you probably are more interested in \\"out-there,\\" non-conformist music if you are in the latter camp). This album is strictly an acquired taste, and that's how the Captain intended, I think. I enjoy plenty of weird stuff--Zappa, The Boredoms, some RIO prog, Mr. Bungle, Fantomas, Zorn, etc. along with quite a bit of abstract jazz and fusionized metal; and after multiple listens I still find this album to be pretty exhausting, especially in one sitting where 2 LPs of this material tends to become obnoxious after a while. It probably would've been better as a single record.<br /><br />I don't hate the Captain for making this album. For better or worse, it's interesting, and both a product of its era (in that it seems to be psychedelic in a rather odd sort of way) and yet exploits musical idioms that were unheard of in rock during its time. The free-jazz-meets-Delta-blues-at-a-postmodern-poetry-slam sound of Trout Mask Replica is rather unique. There's plenty of abstract rhythmic ideas going on--it all sounds rather stupid at first, but Beefheart actually intended it to sound this way, and the Magic Band practiced for nearly a year trying to hammer these compositions out. So, you can't call it \\"amateurish\\" or \\"incompetent.\\" These guys knew what they were doing. As for Beefheart himself, I rather like his great bluesy growl at times. It's like Howling Wolf if he read a lot of Burroughs and did plenty of acid.<br /><br />Trout Mask Replica is definitely innovative. So, why do I persist on giving it only one star? Actually, if I could change the rating I'd give it two, as there are a few decent (not outstanding, merely decent) tracks on here that are listenable--Ella Guru, My Human Gets Me Blues, China Pig, Moonlight On Vermont, and Veteran's Day Poppy. And then there are the straight poetry tracks and other bits that are amusingly weird, though not musical in any real sense.<br /><br />The rest of Trout Mask Replica is not my bag, frequently bordering on unbearable in its pursuit of the abstract. It goes off on tangents that make bags of cats thrown in a dryer seem downright musical. Case in point: Either of the Hair Pie Bake tracks.

Actually, if I could change the rating I'd give it two, as there are a few decent (not outstanding, merely decent) tracks on here that are listenable--Ella Guru, My Human Gets Me Blues, China Pig, Moonlight On Vermont, and Veteran's Day Poppy. And then there are the straight poetry tracks and other bits that are amusingly weird, though not musical in any real sense.     The rest of Trout Mask Replica is not my bag, frequently bordering on unbearable in its pursuit of the abstract. It goes off on tangents that make bags of cats thrown in a dryer seem downright musical. Case in point: Either of the Hair Pie Bake tracks. I can't imagine many people listening to this album without hitting the skip button at least once.

B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I loved the movie and I loved this soundtrack.  The beautiful songs by Kelly Clarkson &quot;The Trouble with Love Is&quot;, Dido, Norah Jones, and Eva Cassidy are just beautiful songs.  This soundtrack is a must have everyone.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
B000066NW0|2.0|This punk album is fair. She screams a lot, so I didn't give her 4 stars. I think it's missing some guitar solos. Excuse me ! But here are even TWO guitarists, and they don't really know how to play guitar !!! If the guitarists would play any guitar solos, this would be perfect. And what I also don't like, are the drums. Here are some techno drums. And this isn't really punk rock. She goes pop in this album. And here is only one punky song. It's SK8ER BOI. I can't hear here a lot of bass. It's missing some bass. I was very dissapointed of this CD. It could be better. I DON'T recommend to buy this album.
0452282152|3.0|The book does read quickly as many readers have noted, perhaps  a bit too quickly. By contrast, Vermeer's paintings take time... years. They can be \\"re-read\\" thousands of times with no risk of tiring. It will be very interesting to see which aspect of the book the upcoming film will emphasize. Just in case someone is interested, there is an informative website devoted entirely to the real painting...
B00005RFAI|5.0|This album is great. I like the songs very much, but not each of them. This album is my favorite Pink album. Pink is better than Cristina Aguilera and Avril Lavigne. I recommend it for you. Buy it!
B0000DYJM6|4.0|pearl jam, one of the greates rock bands ever. i love this band and i love their music. eddie vedder is the greatest song writer of my life time. lost dogs is a great album.  yet i found that 2 of the tracks on this album should have stayed in the closet. these tracks include whale song and sweet lew.  i was dissapointed to find that brother was an instrumental but this version helps show how intence the guitar was behind the vocals. i think whale song should have been replaced with stated of love and trust, a incredably rare song near impossable to find the original studio electric version.  i found sweet lew to be over worked i like the music liricly it is good but vocally it is terrible.  this is because there is so many effects added to the vocals of who ever sings it becomes annoying.  there where other songs that i did not like such as hitchhiker and dont give no lip, yet after listening to them more they grew on me.
B00005JKCH|1.0|Spider-man, Spider-man, does whatever a spider can..... no doubt you've heard that (in)famous little ditty somewhere, which belongs from Peter Parker's infamous little campy 60's cartoon series.  So at least some of you know who Spider-man is.  Now, the show was based on a character who had his own comic series, and he first appeared in a final issue of a short-lived fantasy series called, &quot;Amazing Fantasy.&quot;  40 years after that issue saw print, that same character has finally made his first ever appearance on the big screen(excluding cameos in other movies).  And what can I say?  It SUCKS.  The acting is bad, the plot is messed up(okay, so Uncle Ben dies around June, since it's shortly before Peter's graduation, and then only an hour later, it's THANKSGIVING?!  WHEN DID ALL THIS TIME PASS?!), there is no chemistry between any of the actors, the SFX are lame, and the score by Danny Elfman is forgettable(when did he fall from grace?)  All in all, Spider-man is one of the worst movies ever made.  Avoid it and this horrid DVD like the plague.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|1. Where's Just A Girl?<BR>2. What happened to the *proper* version of Alone?<br />Beyond that, it's a great album; more compelling and more consistent than Riot Act. <br />I agree with everyone; this is just as much for new listeners as for diehards.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I've read the other reviews of CLOSER and have come to many of the same conclusions, primary among them that I could not have imagined a better CD than Josh's first one, but CLOSER truly is even better!<br />In addition to Josh's incredible voice this CD is great because of the careful selection of songs that fit his style to a tee, wonderful arrangements, great musicianship.  Some of the songs actually brought this 50 year old man to tears!
B0000C8AVE|5.0|Segundo disco de Dylan, mi favorito personal y de los mejores discos que se hayan publicado en la decada de los '60. En este disco comienza a aparecer resume todas las caracteristicas de la figura de Dylan acustico, guitarras folk, armonica melancolica, sabemos que la voz no es muy buena pero si canta con sentimiento, letras profundas y bastante critica social y politica. Indispensable y altamente recomendable sobretodo a quienes recien conozcan a Dylan y se pregunten porque la gente habla tanto de sus letras.<br />A proposito, abajo hay una critica que compara a Dylan con JAnet JAckson y dice que Justin Timberlake es mejor que el... simplemente ignorenla.<br />Escribo en espa&ntilde;ol porque es mi idioma original.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I, like probably many of you, have all the DT albums (and bootlegs) and have seen them live on more than a few occasions. They continue to take my breath away with their flawless technical expertise and artistry. There is no weak link in this band. That being said, I have not found my attraction gravitating towards this latest effort. It did not take me on the same emotional travels that the previous two CDs did. As I've seen it written, it felt rushed and less inspired than their previous works. In their defense, it's probably a tough chore to follow two concept albums of such a massive scope as SfaM and 6 Degrees. Add to that all of their other side projects and tours and you may be able to convince me that they were emotionally exhausted. If I sound undecided here it's because I think this CD is a strong effort and will appeal to fans of the metal genre more than progressive metal; both worthy genres, but the latter being where I reside. However, they are still MY band (with all due respect Shadow Gallery) and I still have expectations of great things from them, now and in the future.
0385504209|4.0|A fun book to read and you must be careful not to get caught up in the fiction and believe what Brown is writing.  This book is titled &quot;Fiction&quot; for a reason.  I highly recommend reading this book just because there is some history you can take from it.  I learned a little about art, paris, and the pagan religion.  Some Christians may find the book offensive but you just have to realize you are reading this for the adventure.  I just noticed that Amazon has lowered the price too, this is a great deal for the price they are offering.  Go ahead and pick up Brown's Angels and Demons while you are at it.  This one in just as interesting if not more.  Angels and Demons will keep a Catholic turning pages!!!  Enjoy!
B000068PQ7|5.0|This is a gorgeous record and possibly the most neglected gem in the Gene Clark canon.  Simple, rustic arrangements call to mind The Band's &quot;brown album&quot; or Neil Young's &quot;Harvest&quot;: acoustic guitar, harmonica, bass, drums, a little melancholy piano and stirrings of hammond organ and slide guitar.  This album's mood also reminds me of Bob Dylan's &quot;Desire&quot;.  Gene Clark's poetic lyricism is genuinely moving, and his bittersweet, autumnal emotion shines through beautifully.  I would also recommned this album to fans of modern bands like Red House Painters, Mojave 3, or Mazzy Star.  GREAT
B0000DJZA0|5.0|It's like I'm actually there and it actually SOUNDS good.  Unlike some other live albums...Get this if you're a lover of true, good, rockin music.
0425170349|5.0|This is one of Clancy's best works since 'The Hunt For Red October'. This novel starts out with a hijackers trying to hijack a plane! Now how great of a beginning is that? <BR> The story is about a black organization called you guessed it 'Rainbow'. It is set in London and it goes like this. <BR> John Clark is the leader of 'Rainbow', it would be best to read Tom Clancy's earlier novels to understand who John Clark is, and with him is his partner in crime Domingo Chavez and their wives Sandy Clark and Patsy Chavez. They are on their way to London to set up shop, but just when you suspect it, HIJACKERS are on the plane, and they of course try to hijack the plane. <BR> So with John and Ding come in, they then stop the hijacking and save the day. <br /> While they are on their way to London, extreme enviromentalist are working on a disease that is able to wipe out human existence forever! The diesease is called Shiva, their goal is to wipe out the human race to help save the enviroment from utter destruction. They test the virus on homeless people, and so far, things are going according to plan. <br />John, Ding, and their wives make it to London safely, and just when they were setting up, they are on their first call. Two bank robbers holding hostages in Sweden. So Ding and his crew head to Sweden to see the scene, and of course they kill the bad guys, and they get the hostages. With one hostage killed, but the robbers did it to flex their muscle. Now the whole world see's this, and they are wondering 'who are these men in black doing all these jobs?'<BR> Of course it is a secret, and Rainbow does not really exists. The creation of Rainbow came from Jack Ryan, who is president, AND HATES IT!, to fight terrorism throughout the world. <BR> As the story moves on, a former KGB agent named Popvo see's Rainbow for the first time, and begins to wonder who is this group? <BR> Back at home, one of the cabinet members in the Ryan Administration HATES JACK RYAN because she doesnot agree with his enviromental plan. She of course is part of the plan with the extreme enviromentalists, and the same thing with a high commander in the Army. <BR> So as the attacks keep coming ranging from hostages being held in their own house by terrorist, and the event at the amusement park in Spain, John then thinks that there their must be a link between these events. <BR> Now terrorist are now forming to take over a hospital where Sandy and Patsy work at, Patsy is pregnant with their first child, and Ding is a person who is strong and represents a good role model for the Latino community. So they find out what is going on, they go in there and they get the terrorist who were hell bent on killing everyone inside. <BR> <BR>Now we head back to the doctors (or killers), one of their victims are in their trap, and now she is trying to get contact to the outside world, so she sneaks out of her room, she is intoxicated with Morphine, she then finds a computer with internet access, and e-mails her father about what is going on and she does not know where she is. <BR> The father is looking for her daughter, but when he gets the e-mail, he has hope now, but they cannot find where the e-mail was sent from.<br /> But something else is wrong too, the General from the Army is now going to plant the virus in the cooling system in the Olympics in the land down under. A employee see's something fishy and calls the cops. The General then dumps the plan, and they find the virus. <br /> Now Popvo comes back into the picture, and he meets up with some people who are working on the virus, he then finds out the truth on what is going on, he then makes a run for it, he then tells the government about what is going on, and now Rainbow comes into the picture. They then went to their headquarters in the American Plains, but it is deserted. <BR> <BR>It turns out that they are in South America, now as Ding and his crew come back to America, they get brief, and they are headed to Brazilin the Amazon rain forest. They get the killers, and they save the day.<br /> This is by far one of his best novels, and I just wish that Mr.Clancy would write more novels like this instead of bringing garbage out like The Bear And The Dragon, Red Rabbit, and The Teeth Of The Tiger. <BR> Great novel, and definitely a must read for any Tom Clancy fan out there.
0451169514|3.0|This King Sized novel is highly entertaining. You may never look at a clown the same way again.  Seven kids (typical King cartoon characters) confront a force of evil being fronted by Pennywise the Dancing Clown in small town &quot;Derry&quot; in 1958.  They win the first round, but are back in 1985 for the final showdown between IT, and six of the seven kids all grown up. (One of the seven shaved his veins a little too closely). Unfortunately, King puts on the heavy padding, and no editor with an eye towards job security, would dare cut the master earner of all times.  But this ton of tome should have been shorn by half.  Wanna have an even better time--watch the DVD and enjoy Tim Curry as the coolest clown from either side of Hell. The film version is an improvement over the novel--it's shorter.
B00004S35Z|5.0|Another master class from stevie. his song writing and production is unmistakeable. A living genious
0385508417|4.0|A light-reading Christmas novel with a cute plot. I recommend it if you want to read something short (several hours) and yet get in the mood for Christmas. Great to read in the airport, during lunch or in a waiting room. I couldn't put it down until I was finished. It made me think of the real meaning of Christmas without being too religious or heavy.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Oh my gosh! I first heard Josh on one of the morning shows and when I heard him &quot;blow&quot; I wrote his name down and made sure I went to buy his CD.

0800179501|4.0|I don't have much to add to the previous reviews, except to say to parents who have children under age 13 - be warned! There is some profanity in this movie.  I suggest you preview it and make a list of the places where you'll press the mute button on your remote control, that is if you don't want your children to hear and ultimately repeat some of the language. The profanity consists of: a** 4 or 5 times, several d***s, several G**D***s (when Macchio's character Daniel is complaining about being Mr. Myagi's slave), sh**, and bulls***. Overall, the movie is super. It's a heart-warming and exciting story about a shy, new kid whose grit and determination earn him the respect of his enemies, and the All Valley Karate Championship. It has good lessons about the value of hard work, being true to oneself, and pressing toward your goals in spite of obstacles. I just wish the writers didn't insist on corrupting an otherwise perfect family movie with so much foul language. It adds nothing to the story and somewhat diminishes the character Daniel, the young teen-aged hero.
B000002534|5.0|This CD is nothing short of amazing.  You need to listen to it with an open mind and it will absolutely blow you away.  Carlos is in top form, as always, and the music is excellent

I MYSELF ENJOY A LITTLE HEAVY SOMETIMES, AND THESE GUYS DO IT WITH A LITTLE PIZZAZZ...........
B00005JMFO|3.0|Christmas is that time of year when everybody wants a special someone with whom to cozy-up to the fire and roast chestnuts. LOVE, ACTUALLY wallows in that theme with a superabundance of couples and rogue singles looking for love, or at least sex, under the mistletoe.<br />This circus d'amour has more performers than Barnum and Bailey.  Hugh Grant is the newly installed British Prime Minister who's entranced by his tea girl (Martine McCutcheon), while the PM's sister Karen (Emma Thompson) is in imminent danger of losing husband Harry (Alan Rickman) to an office vamp. Meanwhile, Harry's assistant (Laura Linney) and a co-worker (Rodrigo Santoro) have the hots for each other, but can't seem to connect. On the periphery of the script are a writer (Colin Firth) falling for his non-English speaking housekeeper (Lucia Moniz), the very pre-teen stepson (Thomas Sangster) of widower (Liam Neeson) infatuated with a slightly older girl, a young man hopelessly smitten with his best friend's new bride Juliet (Keira Knightley), a perennial loser off to the States where the Babes are ostensibly more receptive, two soft-porn actors, and a lecherous U.S. President (Billy Bob Thornton). Always in the background is has-been rock singer Billy Mack (Bill Nighy), whose cynical Christmas version of an old hit just may top the charts by Boxing Day.<br />The audience is introduced to all of these plots in the first thirty minutes. The over-the-top cuteness of it all, plus Grant cast as a Prime Minister, would have made me walk out had I been seeing it alone. (Grant's hesitant and shyly diffident character is consistent with all those he's played in a string of romantic comedies - not of the type with the Right Stuff that would get him elected PM in the real world, much less even mayor. In contrast, consider Michael Douglas as the Chief Executive in THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT; he was believable in the role.)<br />There are some very funny moments. As when Harry, under pressure and impatient, is having a gift for his seducer interminably wrapped by a too helpful clerk at a posh department store (Harrods?) before his wife shows up. And when the PM goes door-to-door in &quot;the dodgy part of Wandsworth&quot;.<br />There are some deeply poignant moments also. As the look on Juliet's face as she comes to realize the implications of her wedding video. (Keira Knightley is absolutely bewitching.) And when Karen listens to Joni Mitchell's rendition of &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;.<br />It's not that LOVE,ACTUALLY is unentertaining. It's just that, at 129 minutes of run time, there's too much of a good thing. Paring down the multitude of subplots to just two or three would have helped considerably. Less is sometimes better, especially when it would allow some pretty good actors more room to shine. And if the producers had been willing to pay enough, why couldn't they have gotten Bill Clinton to play the Prez; Thornton's cameo was ridiculous.<br />This is a film that'll play just fine on the small screen. Wait for the DVD.having a gift for his seducer interminably wrapped by a too helpful clerk at a posh department store (Harrods?) before his wife shows up.

B00005QGAV|4.0|By 1991, nearly a decade had passed since Thriller, and Michael Jackson's artistic and commercial descent was well underway.  It was time for a change, so he dumped Quincy Jones and hired new jack swing pioneer Teddy Riley as his collaborator.  It was a good choice; Riley's tracks are ferociously funky, complex and hip (for 1991, at least).  And Jackson rises to the occasion; &quot;In the Closet&quot; and &quot;Why You Wanna Trip on Me&quot; are sorely underappreciated classics, and the others are very nearly as good.<br />However, Jackson apparently also wanted to give production a try himself.  So the album is split between seven Riley productions and seven Jackson productions.  This makes Dangerous feel like two albums in one, which isn't helped by the sequencing (six Riley, seven Jackson, and a final Riley track).  Jackson's half doesn't have the sustained power and strength of Riley's, but it's more eclectic and fascinating.  It's not surprising that &quot;Black or White&quot; was this album's big single; it's the only one of the Jackson-produced tracks that really sounds open, upbeat and universal (like Thriller did).  The others subsume us into his inner world.  &quot;Heal the World,&quot; &quot;Will You Be There,&quot; and &quot;Keep the Faith,&quot; are big-production pop; a bit schmaltzy, but so well-crafted that you don't mind.  &quot;Gone too Soon&quot; is small-production pop, but the above observations are still true.  Jackson's emotions become dark and insular on &quot;Give in to Me&quot; (with some blistering guitar from Guns 'n Roses' Slash), but that's nothing compared to &quot;Who is it.&quot;  After a creepy Freudian &quot;soprano voice&quot; intro from Jackson, he starts obsessing over who stole his girlfriend and declares, &quot;I am the agony inside the dying head.&quot;  The layered orchestration nearly lifts the song out of its emotional quagmire on the break, but then Jackson reappears and pulls it back in.  It's probably the best moment onthe album's second half.<br />Ultimately, Dangerous is a much better record than it's been given credit for.  It never really had a chance; like all of Jackson's later work, it was doomed to exist in Thriller's shadow.  If you're a Jackson fan who was initially disappointed by it (as I was), give it another try.
0783228317|5.0|i had put off seeing this movie for far too long.i enjoyed it thoroughly,Johnny Depps mad cap antics had me in stitches throughout the entire movie and Benicio Del Toro as the strait man keeping the mayhem from getting too crazy was absolutely wonderful.then just when you think things cant get any crazier Dr. Gonzo just goes berserk and the laughs never seem to end.kudos to both actors for a superb effort!
B00005RFVL|1.0|I have had to endure the horrors of this CD unwillingly. And repeatedly. That's what working in a record store will do for ya.<BR>  I survived but the scars run deep.<BR>  Robbie Williams singing swing hits is as much of an oxymore as Eric Clapton singing the blues in an Armani suit. Check that, it's actually way more of an oxymore. It sounds as much out of place and time as someone dressed in a robe scratching away at a harp and singing verses from the Odyssey sitting at some Tokyo square.<BR>  In cases like these there's the added mystery of millions of people finding the aforementioned record wonderful. Well, that could easily be explained by remembering that there's also millions of people (many of them identical with the Robbie crowd) finding Elvis's records awesome (even to this day) or the same happening with the hordes buying away Abba &quot;Best ofs&quot; or others buying their 44th &quot;greatest hits&quot; of the Beatles while thinking they're buying a rock record.<br />    But this gets worse in a hurry. You'd think that in this day and age &quot;performers&quot; who are pushing the gates of Vegas would be spectacularly outdated. I mean, can you imagine the neon signs: &quot;Tonight! At 10 p.m the Hungarian blade-swallowing wizard, and at 11 p.m: Robbie Williams!!!!&quot;<BR>   I cant..Nor do i want to..<BR>    But what impresses me most, is the sociological make-up of the crowd that falls for such a stunt. It amazes me actually, if i may say so..It amazes me not because of the existence of the phenomenon but of the stunning awe-inspiring size of it. Soon arguments like &quot;50 million Robbie Williams fans cant be wrong&quot; will be in abundance. So be it.<BR>   But this is a new, intimidating, definition of &quot;scary&quot; if you ask me.<BR>   Furthermore, this puts another question in a new perspective, namely: whatever happened to good pop music?? Or, to put it rather more precisely, does pop (commercial) music have to be of such ruthlessly low quality in order to be a massive shelf-cleaner? Apparently yes. That goes beyond scary and touches the outskirts of a panic attack.<BR>   I remain indifferent in the warring debate of so many reviewers here arguing on whether Robbie is as good as Frank. To me, this is as much worthy a debate as two people arguing whether an Elvis impersonator (insert favorite Elvis imitator here) is better than the original. I refuse to kill my brain cells in such a horrid way.<BR>   Other than that, i do find merit in owning &quot;Swing when you're winning&quot;: if you have a perverse habit of collecting hopelessly bad music in your house then start your collection right here.<BR>   What? You ask if such a habit exists?? Ohhhh, you'd be so surprised...
B00000JZIK|5.0|Fenster is the man! this is a stellar cast and the acting is superb.Benicio Del Toro nearly steals the movie away from Kevin Spacey as the inaudibly and hilariously cool Fenster.
B00000DLV1|5.0|You probably know the score with live albums. If the sound is bearable without needing to be under the influence of mind-bending substances, if the recording is decent, if the group was up to par without resorting to peculiar versions of their own songs without making them better, if the audience isn't screaming stuff reminiscent of the Jerry Springer show, and if the Hell's Angels arent involved in a brawl during the show (see Iggy Pop's classic 70s live album) then you might (emphasis on 'might') have a half decent album in your hands.<br />   This is totally, undisputably and unquestionanly NOT the case here. Because, this live album is so good it actually comes across better than Portihead's studio albums! <br />    Stunning as this might sound for a live recording it is nevertheless the truth. The reasons why this is true are intriguing. To start with, this the blending of a live classical orchestra and an electronic band. Which, of course, could've been another recipe for disaster (has been in countless of cases before with other more 'organic' bands) but it didnt. What in fact happened was that this concert demonstrated that the mix of classic and electronic music is one that can work wonderfully without harming the charm of the overall atmosphere.<br />    Furthermore, Portishead actually perform versions of their now well-known songs that are actually trippier than the originals. There's tons of psychedelia here to be had, and come to think of it, i wouldnt be able to name another album where a classical orchestra is involved where i could mention 'psychedelia'in the same sentence.<BR>    This is of course extra-rewarding. Portishead's songs when they are good they are brilliant. Some of them here, and especially the slightly less than brilliant ones are transformed to re-worked masterpieces.<BR>    I havent had the chance to see Portishead live yet, but If I'd see anything that comes remotely close to this performance I'd consider myself extremely lucky.<BR>   For the time being I'll stick with this.

0393057658|4.0|I enjoyed the book, and enjoyed reading about the statistics and methods used by the A's in developing their franchise.<br />However, much credit is given to Billy Beane for building the franchise into what it is today.  As the book points out though, he had little to do with the draft until 2002, when he totally took over.  So, lets see where the A's are in a few years, when Billy's players make up their farm system.<br />As for Billy Beane himself.....What a shame.  <br />Prior to reading the book, I knew just enough of the man to consider myself a fan - I tend to root for the underdogs. <br />After reading the book, I've changed my opinion entirely.  Man, what a jerk.  He's a man who has little conscience; little control of his raging temper; uses the &quot;F&quot; word in every other sentence, and &quot;wins&quot; by basically screwing people over.  <br />I used to think poorly of players who said, &quot;It's just a business.

0671027344|1.0|When I first read this book, it came highly reccomended to me by a theater instructor I had at the time (around the time when the book first came out).  Upon reading it I was highly entertained and believed this book to be a revelation of some sort.<br />Now I look back and understand why the sleeve of the book reads \\"MTV Books\\".<br /><br />Did it not occur to anybody how unbelievable oxymoronic the term \\"Music-Television-Books\\" is?  It also seems like a hostile takeover of all forms of media from the corporate giant.  Anyways, to the book...<br /><br />Basically, The Perks of Being a Wallflower will appeal an immense amount to two kinds of people: losers that listen to 'emo' and people that want to be losers that listen to 'emo' (in other words, high-schoolers).  The book in no way, really, will reflect anybodys teenage life, which is a comment this book seems to be getting alot of.  Yet, I'd like to see the person who has a nervous breakdown at age 16 and sits naked on his couch on account of the building pressure.  Furthermore, this books portrayal of an 'alternative crowd' is rather sickening, as it once again enforces the idea to listen to music and watch certain movies not because of entertainment or artistic value, but because of the mere fact that they are not popular.  Excuse me for being blunt and dogmatic, but it is not only lame to enjoy the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but it is also downright disgusting.  The book is basically an attempt at a modernized and generic Catcher in the Rye; only the character in The Perks of Being a Wallflower is such a sissy.<br /><br />Heres the basic rundown of why I cannot stand this book:<br />The main character is a huge sissy; I want a protagonist that can tell me something; not one that just rehashes out the same teen-angst that is already dished out in every movie and song in the first place...I'm sick and tired of this entire \\"it's cool to be depressed\\" thing that is happening in the United States. Stop whining and read a real book by a real author like Philip K. Dick or Graham Greene.  Also, people need to start listening to real rock and roll again; not this 'vintage' garage crap or this horrible 'emo' music.  This book is only enforcing the teen-angst idea that isn't real in the first place.  Teen-angst is just as much a product as Crest toothpaste.  It isn't real, it only exists because books, movies, and commercial music invented it. Stop whining and think about life for a second; stand up for yourself and stop being such a wimp. THAT IS WHY 'THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER' IS AN MTV BOOK FOR MTV VIEWERS.or like Philip K. Dick or Graham Greene.

0446677450|5.0|Your kids may learn how to read and write in school but one thing they will never learn at school is how to become financially secure. This is perhaps the most important lesson of all and one that they WILL learn from this book. I highly recommend that you buy this book and start teaching your kids how to be financially secure. I would also recommend another great book for your kids...&quot;The Power of Positive Habits,&quot; this book will show you how to instill lifelong positive habits for excellent health and success. Invest in your kids now.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Honestly, I don't remember enough about the first \\"Terminator\\" movie or its sequel to know how logically \\"Terminator 3\\" Rise of the Machines\\" relates to them. I decided it didn't matter because the basic premise is itself illogical and because so many years separate the making of each installment that each has to stand on its own. If there is any parallel between the real world and \\"Terminator\\" world, it might be this: By the time \\"T3\\" was produced, nearly all the special effects could be computer generated. This technology has gotten so good that the line between `real' and `unreal' images is quite blurred. What all our real life machines can do in the future is both exciting and frightening.<br />\\"T3\\" takes place just before a super-computer tries to unleash a nuclear holocaust that will allow machines to defeat human beings. T-X [Kristanna Loken], a `female' killer robot, comes from the future to eliminate a twentysomething John Connor [Nick Stahl] and all those who might join him the resistance to come. Close on her heels is Terminator [Arnold Schwarzenegger], whose mission it is to save Connor and his future wife, Kate [Claire Danes]. There are problems for Terminator such as his being an older model than T-X. [Arnold is himself now in his mid-fifties.] There is the sullen, stubborn Connor, who has already been through so much that he doesn't have a clue as to how to lead a revolution. And, of course, when Connor and Kate meet, they don't much like each other. So, what makes them think they will ever marry?<br />There is lots of action here; in fact, the movie could be called one long chase sequence. To me, the chases were well paced and exhilarating. Long is a relative term.<br />Nick Stahl and Claire Danes are two exceptional young actors. Their presence helped make the movie for me. Both seemed to center the movie by giving it interesting performances. It can be argued, however, that they are too good to be in a movie like this. Neither are typical action/adventure types. <br />Overall, \\"T3\\" is one of the best `popcorn' movies of recent times
B00009TB5G|5.0|I loved The Two Towers even more than Fellowship, so to see an extra 40+ minutes is a real treat. More action, more heart, more Ents, more Gollum, and more character development. The 2 flashback sequences of Faramir are the real standout here, fleshing out his character so much more, making him seem more like the beloved character from the books. The extras are amazing, especially &quot;From Book to Script&quot; where Boyens discusses the changes between (duh) the book and the movie. Also of interest was &quot;Cameras in Middle Earth&quot; and the documentaries on Gollum and sound and music in LOTR. Obviously, this is a must for fans of the movie, as well as aspiring directors of any kind because you really get to see the hard work that is poured into a film.
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar has certainly continued their spectacular run of creativity and innovation.  Finding Nemo is a cute story and an incredible viewing event.  I have too little room or time to praise the quality of this movie and DVD.  It  is more than worth while.  It is a must have.  I do not have children yet, but my husband and I bought this DVD as soon as it was released.  We have watched it 4 times since buying it and have watched all of the wonderful additional material.  Even the added material is very interesting.  Way to go Pixar!
B000099T2L|5.0|Earlier this year, I REALLY REALLY hated Beyonce! But when she came out with \\"Crazy In Love\\", and I caught myself singing it on more than one occasion, I had to admit that I was starting to like her. The first day the album dropped, I went out and bought it. I was more than pleased. My absolute favorite song is the slow and extremely sexy \\"Speechless\\". I probably could have done without \\" A gift from a Virgo\\", but I digress. Basically, I think alot of people who didn't like the cd were expecting a very upbeat cd, but its an r&b cd so u get what you pay for.
630027120X|2.0|The Mission es una pelcula producida en 1986 con Robert De Niro, Aidan Quinn, y Jeremy Irons.  El padre Gabriel quiere ensear los indgenas sobre la cristianidad.  Mientras que el padre vive juntos con los indgenas, aprende de su cultura y ellos tambin aprenden de l.  Poco a poco parece que los indgenas aceptan el idea de la cristianidad.  El padre introduce Seor Mendoza, un hombre que antes trat sus esclavos muy mal, a los personas indgenas.  Mendoza se reform y tiene una creencia muy fuerte en la cristianidad.  Mendoza tambin viene a vivir con los indgenas y los quiere ayudar mucho.  <BR> Lo que no me gusta de la pelcula fue que represent a los indgenas como animales, salvajes, y personas primitvos.  Tambin represent a los curas jesuitas como gente humlde y a los portugueses y espaoles como gente agresivo.  Las representacines son muy estereotpicos.<BR> Me gusta mucho la msica de la pelcula.  Funcina como un tipo de lenguaje.  El padre Gabriel usa la msica como una coneccin con los indgenas en el principio de la pelcula.  La usa para decirles en un lenguaje universal que viene en paz.  Los indgenas tocan la msica tambin y  indca que son personas inteligentes si pueden producir la msica.<BR> Pienso que el padre Gabriel no quiso cambiar la manera de vivir de los indgenas.  Creo que el realmente pens que la cristianidad pudo salvar los indgenas.  Es para el espectador a decidir si se salvaron los indgenas.  Es evidente que los indgenas cambiaron la vida y los pensimientos de el padre Gariel y Seor Mendoza.<BR> Sobre todo, pienso que la pelcula es un buen idea.  Aun que tal vez no tiene una representacin completamente verdadera de los indgenas todavia ayuda a atraer atencin a los problemas de los indgenas.  The Mission da un punto de vista sobre los indgenas al mundo.  Muchas personas en el mundo van al cine a divertirse e ahora con The Mission tal vez se van a poner a pensar tambin.
B00005JLR6|5.0|This simple movie is full of storytelling. Dramatic but yet hopeful and pleasurable. The story of the Irish family as they come to the US and build their lifes in N.Y.C. When I left the movie I remember the hopeful and grant feeling I left from Forrest Gump - Highly recommended.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Was a diehard Radiohead fan and found myself being bitterly disappointed in both Kid A and Amnesiac - after a few listens it didn't open up the way OK Computer has.  In fact, both ended up being deleted from my hard drive fairly quickly and the CD's still gather dust.<br />Hail to the Thief is somewhere in between.  The melange of sounds, mixing, rhythms seems far less contrived than KA/Amnesiac, and while I don't think it has nearly the staying power of OK Computer this album has outstanding tracks that do stand the test of repeated listening.  As a group, they don't have the operatic hang-together feel of a great album, but far more worth my money than other recent purchases.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I always felt Pink's first single off of her album was the weakest song on the CD.  I might still feel that way about &quot;Trouble,&quot; But being that &quot;Trouble&quot; is one of my favorite songs of all time now, that just speaks for how kick-@$$ her new album is.  I have loved Pink from the first time I saw her perform; she opened for *NSync a few years ago to promote her very first CD (Can't Take Me Home), and its nice now to hear her own voice shine through and not to have her hidden under studio and executive ideas.  Her first few songs are awesome, as is &quot;Save My Life.&quot;  Her tone is harder in this CD than either of the first two, and she proves she can rock out and join the line of strong female rockstars.  She is no longer bubble gum and pop, as she started out when she emerged as a Pop Princess at the same time as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and even Jessica Simpson.  Now Pink does it her way, and she isn't afraid to tell it like it is.  Don't be scared off by the Explicit Lyric label, either- as she uses the F word sparingly, and those of you that know about mixing music will have noticed she cursed on her previous CDs, but the sound was blurred out to bare the clean label.  Pink's lyrics on &quot;Try This&quot; are not as personal as on older songs like &quot;Family Portrait,&quot; but she gets her point across anyway.  Her writing is stronger than usual, with collaborations with Linda Perry again.  And the last song on the CD is a surpisingly softer side to Pink but very touching nonetheless.  Look for her on tour in the spring!!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This sublime record is a confident blend of instrumental pyrotechnics and crafty songwriting by a band that is so absurdly at the height of their powers that it seems blandly unimaginative and obvious to claim that they are the finest of their genre.  It's a frenzy of speed metal meets prog strangely graced with the best piano player who isn't performing boring music.  Every song -- with the possible exception of the radio-friendly weak spot \\"As I Am\\" -- oozes perfection and clarity about this kind of art.  If you listen to just about any other neo-prog band these days you're listening to a flawed copy of Dream Theater, and on ToT they deliver the essence of their vision.  Throughout we find the blistering, innovative instrument interplay of Scenes from a Memory projected onto the sensibility of \\"Glass Prison\\" from Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  Thus, this is DT in their most frenzied, angry, and creative mode.<br />The early internet consensus maintains that Petrucci dominates this disc.  That isn't quite correct, but it is easy to see how someone might come away with that view.  There's no question that the textures that leap out first and most insistently are Petrucci's.  It sounds like he's working harder than he ever has on these songs, and we get compositions that combine chugging, otherworldly riffage with solo breaks that burn like a blowtorch.  What many listeners seem oblivious to, though, is that many of the solos are mirrored by Rudess on keyboard with a rounder sound coming through the left channel.  Moreover, for every Petrucci rhythm pattern there is something subtle and gripping going on on the keyboards.<br />Portnoy's playing is its usual barrage of muscular, swaggering skill.  It's sometimes easy to overlook Portnoy's performance nowadays because he's changed our aesthetic so that we simply expect his drumming to be this excellent.  There's no question, though, that this disc offers a tour de force.  Portnoy knows better than most musicians howfans want the drums to sound.  We want fast but not repetitive double bass hammering, fast decay symbol stack fills all over the place, and the urgent sonic calamity that you imagine a massive car accident making if only someone could orchestrate it to stay in the odd time signatures.  Listeners who are themselves prog musicians probably by and large recognize that there are drummers technically better and more mind-boggling than Portnoy playing this kind of music (e.g., Dennis Chamber's recordings with Niacin, and Virgil Donati's work with Planet X; or, if you're a drummer and want to really frighten yourself, listen to Vinnie Colaiuta's playing with Karizma).  Still, Portnoy is a rock/metal drummer who has substantial jazz/fusion chops, rather than the other way around, and that's why we end up liking his work better than people who can play outplay him.<br />LaBrie's singing is variously smooth and operatic and gravely and experimental. It mostly astonishes, and I, at least, can't imagine some other voice with DT's songs.  Myung's bass playing offers hints of cleverness here and there, but he is mostly content to show that he can keep up, and keep up he can.<br />Lyrically, ToT is unrelentingly honest and personal.  This is a nice antidote the lyrical excesses of SFAM and 6DOIT.  I love the writing on those two releases, but I cringe as friends who aren't DT fans snicker at some of the overwrought drama.  Confession: When I first saw the titles of the songs on ToT I was terrified that the disc would be some annoying Christian screed (which makes Mullmuzzler's second album to me just unlistenable).   Consider: \\"Honor Thy Father,\\" \\"In the Name of God,\\" \\"This Dying Soul,\\" Endless Sacrifice.\\"  Ugh!  But that concern was completely, totally misplaced.  Here, Petrucci writes about the strain put on relationships due to his being a superhero in a touring rock band (This, of course, is Petrucci's second try at this theme.  cf., \\"Misunderstood\\") and of the troubling connection between violence and religion.  Portnoy's lyrics thunder furiously at a family member in \\"Honor thy Father,\\" and \\"This Dying Soul\\" offers a kind of sequel to \\"Glass Prison.\\"  Even LaBrie offers a heartfelt, haunting vignette about that moment when the life leaves a loved one, as if a light goes out behind their eyes.  (This is also a second try at this idea.  Part of me thinks that they thought, \\"oops, I can write that song better when I think harder about it,\\" but it is more likely that the themes are simply fecund enough to generate lots of songs from.)<br />Most bands working in progressive metal seem ignorant of the history of the form, or, perhaps, are embarrassed by it.  Honest listeners can always hear echoes of bands past, but the artists apparently want to mask their debts.  Dream Theater has always been a refreshing exception to this attitude, and on ToT we find layers of frank but deft homage.  They include numerous musical references to Metallica, and vocal nods to Megadeth and Iron Maiden. Through it all,  DT somehow manages to leave out the cheesiness that bothers us when we listen to our old collection.  Heck, we can hear Dokken in the intro section of \\"Endless Sacrifice,\\" but it is so highly idealized Dokken that it doesn't seem ridiculous.  These footnotes to their history are combined with a respectful borrowing from talented almost-peers, especially Opeth and Tool.  If you're wondering how much nu-metal is on this disc, the answer is \\"not much.\\"  There's a Linkin' Park vocal effect here and there, and a couple of chorus riffs that you can almost hear on MTV, but DT just uses these fragments as touches of sound that contextualize the record within current trends.<br />If you listen to progressive metal or the more aggressive strands of progressive rock, ToT will blow you away.    There's no corner of the genre that DT doesn't touch, and there's no style or moment that other bands do that DT don't do better.  (If you had to name a band in thesame league, there's Pain of Salvation, but then the gap to the next band is vast.)  Dedicated fans will always quibble about which of DT's disc is best.  For me, the order from best was SFAM, I&W, 6DOIT, Awake, and FII.  Where does ToT fit in?  Let's just say that -- at least for the foreseeable future -- when I scroll through my iPod menu I won't instinctively be clicking to \\"Close [my] eyes and begin to relax\\" anymore.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I saw the movie its opening (and closing) weekend -- and was the only one in the theater. Once I got used the eerieness of the experience, I sunk into the beauty and serenity of this film. The guests took the tribute quite seriously and, while some just made well-intended cameo appearances, many weighed in with truly outstanding performances. I expected to cringe at the Eric Clapton - Ravi Shankar instrumental collaboration, but it turned out to be the musical highlight of the film.<br />Any fan of the Beatles, Harrison, or 1960s-80s music will love this tribute.
B000005GYI|5.0|This is another stunning jewel by Milton (check Minas and Geraes being, to me, the other two). It precedes those two other albums by about a couple of years, yet it does not stay behind in terms of its capacity to move and surprise with its beauty. Unlike Minas and Geraes, this album is more of a collaborative effort, counting on almost every great musician in Brazil to give it its identity (see the excellent review by David Mijares, right before mine, for a thorough and loving chronicle of what this album represented in Brazilian popular music and the people who brought it to be such a tremendous work).<br />Because it is the work of a community of talented artists, rather than a personal vision alone, it does not have the integrity of the other works mentioned but this is, by far, not a loss. In the contrary, it offers, instead, an edge and diversity that keeps stunned from beginning to end. You have to remember that it was recorded in 1972, to appreciate the revolutionary quality of what it offers, and recognize to what extent its music was out on the proverbial skinny branches of the Tropicalia's tree. And, whereas other albums called &quot;experimental&quot; suffer from a certain uneven output, this one hits the mark tune after tune. If Minas or Geraes could be considered his Sgt. Pepper or White Album (to draw an analogy with Lennon and McCartney whom Milton loves), Clube Da Esquina 1 is his Revolver.<br />If you can afford it, buy all three of these beauties, your soul will thank you for their unending nourishment.

0812548094|1.0|Only by sheer force of will (OK, and skipping pages here and there) did I manage to slog my way though this 100 page novelette. 100 pages -- what is he talking about? Well if a real editor got hold of this and did his job, that's all that would be left. Ok Terry is creative, he thought of all that filler between that start and end of the book, but did any of it really make sense? Was there any flow? Was it really believable? Did all the whining give anyone else a headache?<br />This would be a great kids book, except he forgot to take the dirty parts out. Happy reading.
B0000CAQ27|4.0|I don't know what the critics were talking about when they said that this isn't a great record, because to me, this is much better than half the crap out there now and Pink sounds better than ever!  <br />On &quot;Try This&quot; Pink shows that she can rock a little bit harder, dance till she's gone, and still write a decent love ballad.  While further exploring rock, punk, dance, and even some 80's, it is clear that she is finding the sound she is most comfortable with while not forgetting to get personal with her lyrics.  <br />I liked this on a first listen and so will anyone who loves chicks that rock!  Even though she is capable of still more I hope that, for now, Pink is here to stay!<br />Best Tracks:  Trouble, God Is a DJ, Oh My God
B00006GEXR|5.0|Oh OK, it's a comedy, but it has all the vital ingredients of drama in the tradition of Greek tragedy. Characters with depth, with really glaring innate flaws (hamartia), pivotal situations, critical connections, human emotion and transformation.<br /><br />Hugh Grant is type-cast in romatic comedies as fantasy-prince characters. Here, he is another 'light' character, but not boyish, not too good to be true. In fact, he's an unapologetic shallow exploiter of the kind of heart. But there is a GREAT (both large and good) transformation into a real adult human being. And he's not the only character who makes an important and 'good' transformation, growing out of their self delusions, changing from the charicatures that they want to be, to the adults that they must be, through helping others. OK, the message is a little predicable and mushy: no man is an island. But it's delivered in a really funny, realistic and interesting way.<br /><br />Other wonderful aspects of this movie:<br /><br />1. It shows the very British practice of being excessively polite. Study this movie to learn how to be REALLY polite, and kind.<br /><br />2. It displays wonderfully snide, appropriate, funny and acute comments. A real bravura display of British snideness<br /><br />3. It shows that children are NOT naive. They are intelligent, tough, resilient, courageous and NOT TO BE PATRONIZED.<br /><br />I loved this movie, laughing uproariously more than once, and I've been accused of not having a detectable sense of humor.
B00005JMFO|5.0|Love Actually is a perfect Christmas \\"feel good\\" movie for adults. After all, why should children be the only ones to enjoy Christmas? Christmas is a big deal in the UK, and this movie takes us there to experience it. Somewhat romanticized, of course. Some people may believe the movie could be overly sweet.<br />Don't be misled, this movie has plenty of blue moods in it, but it is, in the end, upbeat with a feel good ending. The film follows several romantic developments among a bunch of people who's lives casually overlap. Love is the consistent link among all: from the prime minister, down to a 12 year old boy. What is particularly poignant is that the feeling of love (or falling in love) is true across all the relationships. We feel as empathetic of the little boy's pursuit of the most popular girl in school, as we do for the prime minister's fall for the serving girl.<br />What struck me most about this movie (apart from the brilliant job it did to bring love to live on the screen), was the well integrated characters that ranged from average boy to popular school girl, from prime minister to serving girl, from estranged wife to cheating husband, from impossible love to mixed race marriage, and a silly brit who goes to America to pick up girls based solely on his accent. All of these scenarios strike true and real (well, except the last one maybe ...).<br />The movie, by US standards, is very \\"exposed\\"; there are a bunch of nude scenes for a particularly endearing couple who meet  through their work as nude body doubles for actors. Even though they have seen each other naked from day one, it takes them quite a while to work up towards a romantic kiss.<br />Five stars for bringing love and Christmas to the screen like no other movie has done for a long time. I anticipate that this will become a standard Christmas movie to be shown on TV for many years to come - and so it should. Highly recommended.

FINALLY!!!!!! <br />Includes two DVD's with 4 hours of add-ons. <br />Some of the scenes are among the best ever filmed. At times the music and the imagery combine to amazing effect (e.g. when Mrs. McBain waits for no one to pick her up, walks into the train-station and then the camera pans over the roof out onto the city-center. Absolute perfection.).<br />Low price. 2 CDs. One of the greatest movies of all time. Get it.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Honestly, when Christina's first work came out with Genie in a Bottle, I was anything but impressed. I did not respect her mostly because she did not write any of the songs, but also because I just could not respect that bubble-gum pop which just never sounded real to me. I always felt you could tell just by listening when artists do not write their own music. When an artist begins to produce their own work, there's something about it that makes it sound so much more original, clean and genuine to me. Christina did a good thing to herself and to music fans by taking charge with her career and writing songs herself. After I heard Stripped, I concluded that she's the most AMAZING female singer I've ever heard (which was almost discuised in her first album...it almost sounded like she wasn't really trying), but she's also a GREAT songwriter and I only wish she had exercised that talent earlier. On her first album, every song almost sounds the same to me. But Christina did a VERY good job at keeping a large variety of songs on Stripped! I can't get bored with this album because almost every song is pretty much a different style. There is a combination of pop, R&amp;B, and some that only consist of vocals and acoustic guitar. It sickens me when I hear closed-minded people calling her a talentless singer(If her music's not their thing, they should just say so)...and I'm really not biased because I was not a Christina fan before I heard this album (and my first favorite bands were punk and metal bands). I had picked up the CD to use for practice with my singing lessons, but ended up listening to it all the time once I realized it's so awesome! I seriously recommend this album to everyone who can appreciate real talent!
B000089RVR|5.0|I loved &quot;No Angel&quot;, and enjoy &quot;Life for Rent&quot; just as much. Dido is one of my favorite artists, a wonderful reprieve from the more hard-core, loud music (which I enjoy as well, different music for different times). Her music videos are wonderful as well, especially for &quot;White Flag&quot; in my opinion.<br />On a side note, reviews are most helpful when they critique the music, not the people who choose to listen to the music.
B00005JM1F|2.0|**1/2 \\"Old School\\" is a raucous, raunchy comedy in the \\"Animal House/Bachelor Party\\" tradition.  Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn - all of whom are very good in their roles - play a trio of thirtysomething losers who have never really grown up, despite the fact that one of them is married with children, another has just gotten married and the third wants desperately to have a meaningful relationship.  The three come up with a scheme to create an \\"unofficial\\" fraternity at the local college, giving men of all ages a chance to get away from the rules and restrictions of everyday adult life.<br />Although there are a few undeniably funny moments in the film, \\"Old School\\" is basically a numbskull comedy filled with junior high-level jokes and pratfalls, some of which work but most of which don't.  Like far too many comedies that advertise themselves as freewheeling, daring and iconoclastic, \\"Old School\\" ends up literally \\"old school\\" in the end, coming out foursquare in favor of responsibility, seriousness and conformity.  In other words, it wants us to identify with these juvenile grownups, then turns right around and makes them just like the people they've been going after all along.  Unfortunately for the viewer, \\"Old School\\" loses the courage of its convictions early on.<br />There's not much point in over thinking this.  Suffice it to say that \\"Old School\\" sprinkles a few good laughs over a parched desert of a comedy.
B00000K19E|5.0|Without all of the sequels...subplots...etc this movie would be great. that is to say it could easily be a stand alone and the best movie that this decade has produced (last decade? watever) I was so enthused with this movie that i made my own web page about it. be amazed and go here : [...]
0446310786|4.0|Harper Lee told a great story with this book about the way things were in the 30's.  Racism, poverty, and peer pressure were all expressed very well in the story, and it accurately depicts the struggles of standing up for an unpopular cause.  I had to read this for my freshman English class a few years ago, and I'm glad that I did because it's a great story with a good message behind it--don't judge a man until you know the man.
B00005JMFI|4.0|Will Ferrell is a comic genius. Throw him in a wacky Elf costume and you have a hit movie on your hands. I loved this movie. Ferrell really captured the innocence of a child and all the cute/funny things one child can do. Ferrell finally uses PG humor at its best. This is a movie for anyone, young and old!
6304806442|5.0|Okay this is not a groundbreaking film or anything, but it is smart, catchy, and has excellent characterization. Nothing to mention that this is a all-around Fun Movie to watch, and has probably the best ending monolog for any motion picture you'll see anytime soon. I'd say if you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and make it your next rental cause you'll go back wanting the dvd.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|Let me say first that DT is still the best band in the world!!<br />Having said that, even great bands can put out bad CD's.....or maybe I should say bad idea for a CD. Past DT CD's mixed heavy, driving songs with songs that allowed you to breath. A DT CD was a journey, taking you through a mix of emotions. <br />ToT is one emotion: angry. It sounds like they were going for the Lincoln Park, Godsmack thing; only with more musicianship!

0805047905|5.0|Brown Bear is a great book that teaches children about colors and rhyme. Any child, from age 2 on, will beg to read this book again and again.<br />The illustrations are excellent in a unique way. The texture of each page's pictures provides an excellent companion to the teach-me-to-read text. You can't go wrong with this book for any youngster.
0380789035|4.0|As always the characters are what drive the story, and it was interesting enough to keep me reading with every free moment. As always, I love Gaiman's attention to the little details of mythology and history, and his compelling characters. However, you can tell what's coming down the road through the whole book if you've read any of his other work. It's worth the read though.

The mmm-mmm-mmm at the beginning of Old Habits is just sensual, leading you into a strip-it-bare stolidly mournful song.  This album is one of his best.

B0000CDLA7|1.0|I agree completely with Eddie's review called &quot;the end&quot;. Since ACOS, not even SFAM has been good in my opinion. SFAM pretended clearly to be an apology for that disaster that was FII. But even its lyrics are the poorest romantic literature. From then on, concert, video and the newest studio albums, terrible. And as I said in a previous review, I came to relate this new DT with MP. He does everything.<BR>Sad, really sad. WDADU, Awake, IAW and ACOS were excellent because they were composed, thought, planed, corrected, not jammed.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|To those who call this album sappy, I say read the title. This is a Christmas album, and Christina Aguilera seems to have that down. She fully utilizing her beautiful voice and extraordinary talent to emote throughout the tracks of this album.<br />The tracks are a mix of traditional songs, which have been &quot;Christinaized&quot;, and several more contemporary offerings. The vibes throughout display her pop style and ability to work with any original style of music. Be aware: you won't find hot songs here, but you will find Aguilera's great talent dispersed throughout classic scores of holiday song.

B00005JMFR|5.0|The purpose of this review is not to critique the movie itself as I have already done that in my previous review.  There I stated that although many have been disappointed by the movie, I do not share those feelings.  I enjoyed the action and found it to be a descent, though admittedly flawed, conclusion to a great science fiction trilogy.  Here I review the IMAX presentation of the movie.  The first time I saw the film it was in the Mann's Grauman's Chinese theatre in Hollywood.   That theatre has state-of-the-art sound and video that was a perfect compliment to a movie like Revolutions.  When I decided to see the movie again, I thought only an IMAX presentation could top my previous experience.  For those not familiar, IMAX theaters boast a 7 story high screen and a 12,000 Watt sound system.  They normally screen movies filmed specifically for IMAX theatres.  They have however shown the last two Matrix films on IMAX screens.  It is an experience not to be missed.  If you saw Reloaded on IMAX, you have a pretty good idea what to expect.  The clarity of the picture and richness of the sound is amazing.  I did notice one difference though.  When I saw Reloaded, I recall the film had been formatted to fit on the gigantic IMAX screen.  In other words, it filled the entire area of the screen.  I assume (but am not positive) that the picture's aspect ratio had to be changed to do so.  For Revolutions however, the movie was letter boxed, so it retained is original aspect ratio.  I personally think this is a better way to present the film.  Seeing a movie on the IMAX screen is generally a little more expensive than your standard theatre, but it is worth the experience, especially if you are like me and love the big screen experience.
B0000A1RJI|2.0|I know a lot of people will hate me for saying, I think this movie wasn't entertaining, wasn't funny, kept going on and on, and Orlando Bloom scared the crap out of me! He seemed more appealing in the Lord of the Rings series.<BR>(Which I highly recomend seeing, if you havn't)<BR>Its not like I hate this movie....but it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It seemed, to me, another one of those adventure shows that had practically no twists, a mooshy love story, a bunch of cheap action, unbelievable special effects, and a happy ending......oh brother...<BR>The only thing that I truly enjoyed about Pirates of the Carribean was Johnny Depp. Now he was awsome! He alone earned my extra star! I know alot of fans will hate me, but I had to lower the ratings for this movie....it just blowed. ^..^
B00005JLEU|4.0|Although I enjoy Miyazaki's work, I cannot say that this is his best in my opinion. I believe that those who have problems with this movie are limited to being Disney-fied throughout their childhood. Spirited Away doesn't have a traditional U.S. plot progression and that will throw some people off from what they are used to. Good! Storytelling shouldn't be confined to Hollywood's predictable timing and blaring plot points. Miyazaki is a great director that will take you on a true adventure where you DON'T know what's going to happen next.<br />I could continue on with the many good points of the movie: the animation, imagination, and plot. However, I find that critiques are only valuable for the criticisms (we all know this movie isn't going to fall below 4 stars on Amazon). The main problem I have with this movie is that there are so many imaginative plot points, they become forgetable. It seems to plateau rather than build. It's great to see it revealed layer by layer in an Alice in Wonderland fashion, but people have their favorite parts and forget other parts of that story as well. <br />Next criticism is the spiritual/environmental message. To me it feels trite and somewhat crammed down the viewers' throat. You might argue that it is only a cartoon and it is meant for children anyway, but let's face it, Miyazaki knows that his audience is primarily adults--which is true. The premise wears thin by the end.<br />For this reason I give it 4 stars, only in relation to his other movies. Compared to many Hollywood flicks, this rates a 5. Princess Mononoke and Kiki's Delivery Service are still two of my favorites.
B00008J4P5|4.0|My problem with this album is how great it could have been. While jack whites songwriting and guitar work is very good throughout, many of the songs still seem somewhat weak and forgettable. They need a bass player desperately. Their sound would be so much more robust and powerful. A replacement drummer wouldn't hurt either cause lets face it, meg sucks behind the kit. Elephant is still a very fresh and fun album and &quot;You've got her in your pocket&quot; might be the best song to come out in the last 5 years.
B00005JKNF|4.0|It's tough to fault the hordes of viewers who found this movie dreadfully unbearable, \\"a waste of time\\", \\"utter tripe\\" etc. I couldn't tell a footboy from a butler or a valet myself, but I could surely feel that this was one long movie!<br />But that doesn't mean it is not a deliciously watchable feast of film making.<br />Setting: a bunch of woefully uppetty folks meet up at a humongous country house in Britain for a week of shooting pigeons (one of those affluent pursuits.) Each rich soul has a dedicated, personal servant to be pandered by. And the movie's various funny moments derive from this now-comical-but-then-a-reality setting.<br />The narrative is Altman-fabulous and lined with a liberal dose of wry humour:<br />  - \\"So you think he's the murderer?\\"<br />  - \\"No, even worse. He's an actor.\\"<br />...and a fair amount of cultural barbs:<br />  - \\"Stop snivelling, they'll think you're Italian!\\", or,<br />  - \\"You Brits don't have a sense of humour, do you?\\" and the ever so politely delivered retort, \\"We do, when something is funny, Sir.\\"<br />After only the hour and 10 minutes of introductions to the various characters, when we do hit the crime, the turtle pace quickens a notch. I can see why this long pregnant wait leaves some viewers wraught. But personally I found this Agatha Christie-esque unravelling of each individual's idiosynchrasies fascinating, because it sets up a \\"motive\\" for several of our characters. It's twice as much fun if many people COULD have executed the murder.<br />Enter: Stephen Fry as a very Sherlock Holmes-esque investigator, pipe and trenchcoat and all. Kind of builds up hope for a thrilling investigation, doesn't it. Trouble is, none is forthcoming. Fry made do with a small-fry part really.<br />No, the murder is instead solved in a somewhat lame manner, by one of the inquisitive maids. This is the biggest gyp of the film and the reason I take off the 1 full delicious star. I could see the ending coming from a mile.<br />Overall a stylishly told story, with some very good moments. I found the subtitles very handy as the Scottish accents, and the occasional argot, are a bit tough to comprehend.<br />Don't really set yourself up for a murder mystery who-dun-it, which it could be argued it is, in a half-baked sort of a way, but that is probably a plus: this is not your run of the mill murder mystery but an off-beat movie that'll nonetheless hold your attention.stylishly told story, with some very good moments.

We live within the 'rules' and expectations of a good life, unquestioning.  We consider anyone who deviates from the conventional and mainstream as mad.  Love has a powerful role in giving strength and meaning to life.  When one could live life as if everyday is a miracle, then perhaps one has found the meaning and joy of living.  I think everyone would get something out from this book.
0140186409|5.0|I have always hated the so called 'classics' but then i started reading this and i just couldn't stop.  I feel it is an amazing book.  Even if you have no previous knowledge of the context or even any interest in the time period it is still brilliant in its portryal of humanity and the human will for survival.  It is not simply a novel that was great it is a novel that is great and will continue to be great for a long time to come.  The language is a bit hard to get into at first but after about the first chapter it becomes so much a part of the experience....i even found my self thinking and speaking using the language of the novel.  I higly recommend this to every one especially those who have a vengeful hate of classics like i do.
078062999X|5.0|Some people may shrink away from this because it is nearly four hours long. Please don't let that stop you! It is magnificent, and much more fulfilling than any previous version. Finally Shakespeare's complete play is on screen and the subtleties are all preserved. This is the benchmark and will be until someone else decides to put forth his own uncut version. Even then it's likely to pale before Mr. Branagh's.
B00005JMFR|2.0|I really need to forget I ever saw this movie.  After the first two GREAT movies, I just knew this one was going to be awesome.  They had such a great story working, and the groundwork they laid for this one in \\"Reloaded\\" had me salivating.  But, then I saw this mess.  The story in \\"Revolutions\\" didn't even seem related to the other two.  Although it did have some nice special effects, the plot was poorly explained and the resolution of the story made no sense.  It's like they opened up all these great angles in the first two but had no idea how to resolve them.  This movie could and should have been ten times better.  Wait for video.
B00005JMFO|4.0|Christmastime in London - shoppers milling about, cool, crisp winter breezes, with mistletoe and a good dose of holiday cheer enough to fill many a stocking. Add to this bastion of sweet Christmas goodies, four various scenarios involving people of different professions, all of whom juggling both home and family with a roundabout love life. This makes for an interesting combination of a full-blown soap opera, combined with the wit and wisdom of an intellectual novel. Piece the entire puzzle together, and you have a well written, directed and produced motion picture that is \\"Love Actually\\". Hugh Grant is \\"The Prime Minister\\" - a sort of chap trying to keep a small nation afloat, while attempting to keep his love life at bay as well. \\"LA\\"'s other leading man, Colin Firth, is also trying to balance out his life, and falls for a Portugese woman (who doesn't speak English) along his tumultuous journey. Bill Nighy plays a pompous, arrogant middle-aged rock star named Billy Mack, who has everything and wants even more (more people of the female persuasion, that is). Donald Sutherland look and sound alike actor Alan Rickman nearly steals the show here, as his portrayal of a book author will turn many a head, thus making the critics really sit up and take notice. The actors aren't the only attraction here. The contrasting architectural backdrops of \\"old and new\\" London blend in perfectly with the film's storyline. When looking for a romantic setting, one can't find a more romantic city than London to center a story around. Of \\"Love Actually\\"'s funnier moments, the prize for comedic excellence would most likely go to Bill Nighy for his portrayal of a flashy, overbearing and conceited rock star. This guy gets the funniest lines in the entire movie, even stealing a scene (or two) from Mr. Grant! Another priceless and hilarious moment, is when \\"The Prime Minister\\" and his limo driver are singing \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" (as \\"mock carolers\\") to a group of children! Alas, there are many more priceless and funny moments from where these came. Great supporting roles are also supplied by Keira Knightley (as one of the daughters) and from Rowan Atkinson (as a department store clerk), among others. With so much to offer, \\"Love Actually\\" is sure to be in the running for \\"Best Picture of 2003\\" honors, as well as being a major box office draw this holiday season. So, whether you're bitten by the love bug or not, you \\"Actually\\" don't want to miss all the \\"Love\\" that's destined to come your way at your local venue today!any more priceless and funny moments from where these came.

B00005JMFR|4.0|Couple of years ago I saw the first part of Matrix, and I enjoyed it. I considered it interesting, but not great. Moreover, I am not an action junkie, though I have to say, Revolutions was over my expectations. It impressed me a lot and in the end I realised the 2 hours passed so fast.<br />It is a good movie in terms of action and special effects. Also, it does not lack interesting ideas - one needs to have some brain in order to figure out some clues.  So, if you are looking for  ideas, believe me, they are there - you just have to look for them.<br />If you are looking for action, it is there. It is also a real revolution in what special effects and computer technology can do today. And I would give an Oscar for the special effects!<br />I also enjoyed the ending, whici is \\"open\\", in the sense that  it could genetrate a lot of questions and answers. Or maybe a fourth Matrix.<br />I am a bit dissapointed about the negative reviews this movie got, as I don't think it is like the other action films Hollywood produced so far. It is smart, well done, with action and emotions.<br />I will not talk here about the plot, but I will suggest you to go and see it at the cinema with an open mind. I am sure you will enjoy it.
B000003N89|5.0|Every song on this CD is wonderful. Diana Krall is surely one of the most refreshing talents to come around in a while. She infuses each song with her smoky voice, very passionate. Her piano playing is fine and complements the other soloists perfectly. Lastly, her version of 'Boulevard of Broken Dreams' is the best recording of that standard I've ever heard.

To those of you who actually liked this book; I feel more sorry for you than the disturbed author. After this agonizing experience, I may never read a piece of fiction again. The only reason I finished reading this book was because I was amazed at how bad it was...similar to that of driving by a traffic accident. I am hoping to get Mr. Martels address in an effort to receive a refund.
0800128052|5.0|&quot;Rudy&quot; - the 1993 blockbuster starring Sean Astin in the title role, is one motion picture that reminds us no goal or obstacle is too big or too small to be accomplished successfully, if one is willing to persevere through all hardships. &quot;Rudy&quot; gets this message across to the viewer quite well, and with no major stumbling blocks or any errors, for that matter. Determined to defy all those who doubt his dream of playing football at the University of Notre Dame, Daniel &quot;Rudy&quot; Ruettiger sets off for South Bend, Indiana with a duffle bag filled with hopes and a bus ticket. Once arriving at his intended destination, he is met by a caring Catholic priest (Robert Prosky), who sees Rudy's heart and desire, and is determined to help this young man accomplish his goal. A timeline is established, where Rudy must maintain a respectable grade point average at Holy Cross Junior College in a year's time. If grades are successfully met, he'll be one step closer to realizing his dream of both playing football for the Fighting Irish, thus gaining admission into Notre Dame. Adding a bit more meat and potatoes to &quot;Rudy&quot;'s storyline, are fine, upstanding, believable performances from Ned Beatty (as Rudy's father), Scott Benjaminson (as Rudy's doubting Thomas brother), Lili Taylor (as Rudy's girlfriend) and Jason Miller (as legendary ND coach Ara Parseghian). Charles S. Dutton's performance as the head stadium groundskeeper mustn't be overlooked, either. To sum everything up, &quot;Rudy&quot; is a film that's about more than just football. It's about conquering mountains, big and small, which isn't impossible, as long as one keeps their nose to the grindstone, or, in this case, to the gridiron. Having doubts about whether or not you can win life's battles? See this movie. Hearing nothing but negativity from those around you while en route to accomplishing your goal? See this movie. Do you dream of getting a college degree, and want to make it a reality? SEE THIS MOVIE!!! Oh, and see if you can spot the cameo appearance of Mr. Daniel Ruettiger himself (INTERESTING TIDBITS: The exterior shot of the Holy Cross College campus, is actually one of the colleges on the Notre Dame campus. The scene in the campus coffee shop where Rudy and D-Bob (Jon Favreau [another actor I (almost) overlooked!]) are talking/studying, is shot in ND's O'Shaughnessy Hall, and the interior Holy Cross classroom scenes were filmed at a nearby high school). With so much to offer, &quot;Rudy&quot; truly lives up to its moniker as the &quot;Rocky Of The '90s&quot;! See it, if you haven't already. You won't be disappointed!lity? SEE THIS MOVIE!!!

B00000IFWE|4.0|I ran to buy this CD when I heard \\"Free Girl Now\\" on the radio and flashed back instantly to \\"Refugee\\". Petty, sounding 20 years younger, and the remnants of the Heartbreakers, didn't try to recreate their 70's sound. But the energy level and feel of that song, and much of this CD, are like nothing you've heard since \\"Damn the Torpedoes\\". This CD isn't perfect; it's unnecessarily uneven, and there are bad songs here. With 15 songs running over an hour, several could have been left out and there would have been plenty of material left to make a near-perfect 40-minute recording. Still, this is the Tom Petty that finds its way into my CD player these days. It's the best thing he's done since \\"Full Moon Fever\\". Stylistically, the music is sometimes reminiscent of \\"Wildflowers\\", sometimes of the early Heartbreakers or the \\"Full Moon Fever\\"/\\"Great Wide Open\\" period, but not overproduced like those CD's. The songs are often on the light, fun side, but there are several that are full of emotion as well. There is so much more energy, melody, and harmony here than on \\"The Last DJ\\".<br />The standout songs are \\"Free Girl Now\\", \\"Room at the Top\\", and \\"Echo\\", all of which are heartfelt and echo the feel of the early Heartbreakers sound with a good bit of Dylan thrown into \\"Echo\\". \\"Accused of Love\\" and \\"Won't Last Long\\" are lighter songs that are as melodic and catchy as anything Petty has ever done, with hooks, rhythms, and psychedelic touches reminiscent of 60's pop songs. \\"This One's For Me\\" has a bit of that same feel, but is less memorable. \\"Counting on You\\" is reminiscent of \\"Honeybee\\" and, like several tracks here, is up there with minor songs of the \\"Full Moon Fever\\"/\\"Great Wide Open\\"/\\"Wildflowers\\" era. \\"Lonesome Sundown\\" and \\"No More\\" are pretty, but nothing special. \\"Swingin'\\" is boring and repetitive, though not as boring as most of the \\"Last DJ\\" songs. \\"Billy the Kid\\" has the same flaws, and the \\"getting up again\\" theme was done better as \\"I Won't Back Down\\" long ago. These two songs might have been left off the CD along with \\"About to Give Out\\" and the downright embarrassing \\"Rhino Skin\\". I just didn't need lyrics about elephant balls, sorry. \\"One More Day\\" isn't a great song, but it closes the album nicely with its soulful chorus and the slow buildup to a searing climax of dueling lead guitars.<br />Based on the reviews here, there seem to be all sorts of Tom Petty fans who like different phases of his career. If it helps to figure out whether your tastes might be similar to mine, I like the first two CD's, think \\"Torpedoes\\" and \\"Hard Promises\\" were masterpieces, that \\"Long After Dark\\" began a decline that continued gradually through \\"Southern Accents\\" and \\"Let Me Up\\". Just when I was about to give up on the man, I got big smiles out of the Wilburys, \\"Full Moon Fever\\", and \\"Great Wide Open\\", which may have been overproduced and were usually more whimsical than passionate, but were so well-crafted. Since then, nothing has really stood out to me. \\"Wildflowers\\" was really nicely done but for some reason I hardly ever listened to it, I didn't buy the soundtrack album, and I find \\"The Last DJ\\" to be abysmal except for a few songs. \\"Echo\\" is currently my favorite Petty CD just because I overplayed \\"Full Moon Fever\\" and \\"Great Wide Open\\", have to be in a silly mood for Wilburys, and the old stuff is, well...old, even if it's better. But I do hit the skip button a lot on \\"Echo\\".<br />Overall, \\"Echo\\" isn't perfect, but there are a lot of pleasures to be found here, and a few great songs.

0399226907|5.0|My 2 year old daughter just loves this book one of her favorites for bed time.It is as the title refers a story about a caterpillar who starts out from and egg and hatchs and on an adventure for food.It is very easy book that teaches them some fruit days of the week and some numbers and is one of those book that is not to bad to read over and over to them.I belive there are four or five books that make a complete set they are all great.This book i thought was easy enough that it was not long that my daughter could pretty much tell me the story
0385504209|5.0|Wow, I could not put this book down.  It grabbed me right from the beginning.  Although the storyline is controversial, I was not averse to hearing a new angle on the Holy Grail and the secret Da Vinci society.  It's a shocking supposition about Christianity that has many people up in arms, especially after the &quot;20/20&quot; segment that recently aired regarding this book.  Nevertheless, this is America - where you are free to speak, read, or write any story you want.  True or not, this book is an exciting and suspenseful read.  You don't have to believe in it to become absorbed by it.  And you will.  Enjoy!
0060512806|5.0|This book is so fantastically engrossing that we read passages from it daily, as prayer offerings to the almighty Neal Stephenson that he may bless us with additional intricately crafted reads.
0385504209|2.0|I think the core problem is that once you figure out what the puzzle is, you lose interest.  It's not a very captivating object of mystery for most people.  And the repetition of everything--the endless puzzles, chases, clues, villain/hero determinations.  Yawn.  Best part was the first 30 pages.  Last few pages were hardly an ample reward for enduring this long, twisted, predictable tale.  Quel surpris!  The Sophie's entire family REALLY didn't die in a car accident?  What moron couldn't have foreseen that?  Get out of here?  Sophie, the gorgeous code expert, and Robert, the warm-hearted, lonely, academic live happily ever after?
B0000CAQ26|5.0|I like that Pink can change her style.  She does have range (she proved that on the AMA's last night).  This new CD is a little harder, more punk than Missunderztood.  Let's just hope that she doesn't try &quot;country&quot; next!!
0441003257|3.0|Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, Good Omens (Ace, 1990)<br />So many people seem to consider this book the Second Coming of the Hitchhiker's Guide that I'm now scared to re-read Douglas Adams, for fear that my great enjoyment of the first three Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books was youthful folly rather than appreciation of great art.<br />Don't get me wrong, there are laugh-out-loud moments in Good Omens. But they are neither as frequent as they are in Gaiman's American Gods, nor are they couched in as gripping a prose style. The plot is, to be sure, capable of pulling the reader along; Aziraphale, an angel, and Crowley, a demon, are trying to figure out exactly where the Antichrist has got off to so they can start the apocalypse. Except neither (they've become friends over time) is exactly sure they want the apocalypse to start, because they've grown rather fond of Earth.<br />It's hard to actually pinpoint any problems with Good Omens, except that perhaps it tries too hard every now and again. It just didn't grab hold and refuse to let go in the same way American Gods (or the hitchhiker's Guide) did.  ***
B000068PNQ|2.0|i love the original cd but the second cd is the same than the first,should be like Loaded (fourth lp of Velvets) in his version &quot; fully loaded edition&quot; two disc with alternate and different versions of the same songs
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|This cd may grow on me, but as it is the cd really is not as good as the first. It really doesn't sound ike the first, it takes ideas from new bands like Rooney and Hot Hot Heat.  Instead of gritty New York inspired songs they create a sort of 80's poppiness.  This would be allright if Cassablanca's vocals weren't buried in the mix to the point where you really do need the included lyric sheet to even tell what he's talking about.   This also hides their sense of melody, putting the guitars and bass to do all of the work.  The mix is probably the main offender on the cd, the drums and vocals sound like they were recorded in a cardboard box, and then put low into the mix, with the guitars and bass taking over the whole sound.  On the best songs like 12:51 the sound works.  This is a record that requires alot of listening to like.  There aren't any songs that immediatly jump out at you except for the first single, all the others are marred by canned vocals and guiar heavy production... but there is hope, it will probably get better with more listens. I can't help but say give the record a chance, I'm going to keep listening to it, and I suggest anyone who has bought it to do so as well, it does show promise, they are moving forward, this record really doesn't sound like the first record, but I don't think the promise on this record will be fully realised untill the next record.  So what can I say, buy it and try it and give it a chance.
038533348X|1.0|This is a decent sci-fi escape, but nowhere near as good an escape as Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, or Star Wars: A New Hope. This isn't very challenging, and you may feel compelled to read it because of the almost too simple story, and easy going language. This is basically a book about a mad scientist who tries to take over the world by freezing it over with a substance called Ice-Nine, and at the end he succeeds because of his children's greed to control it. Again, not very complex or deep, a basic fable, but still entertaining. But as entertaining as Star Wars? NO. I recommend renting the star war movies or getting the star war books, especially the ones with Jabba the Hut. Cat's Cradle has no point or meaning to it, unlike Lucas's prophetic, amazing vision. Vonnegut is funny, but not very intelligent.
B000001Y5X|4.0|Marilyn Manson's debut album is still just as controversial today as it was when it first came out and also still just as fun to listen to. The CD is filled with 13 tracks of utter delight to fans of controversial and heavy music that brings bitter disgust to the more closed-minded music listeners that fear this band's image and so-called stance on things. But whether you agree with the opinions made in their music or not, you have to admire the upright balls they have to do what they do and be successful at it. As a loyal Marilyn Manson fan, this is a must-have for any Manson fan to understand where this band and man first evolved from. Before he was the all-American Antichrist, the androgynous Omega, the fallen revolutionary Adam, or the current Arch Dandy No-Goodnik, he was a rather playful mischief maker who released this scrum-diddily-umptious collection of nursery-rhyme songs  mixed with a slab of religion, incest and playground bullying into a cartoon nightmare. Let us observe...<BR>PRELUDE (THE FAMILY TRIP) is a minute long intro to the demonic Willy Wonka boat-ride tune setting the stage for what is to come. It leads to CAKE AND SODOMY, a highly political song comparing this nation to that of high men who will in the end put us &quot;white trash&quot; down on our knees into our place. LUNCHBOX then illustrates a young boy beaten on a playground taking vengeance with his rectangular hunk of &quot;metal&quot; he has with him. ORGAN GRINDER shows a once scared individual finally unmasking himself to his loved ones for what he is, showing them his &quot;real head&quot;. In the next song, we see the fictional character of the CYCLOPS being a sort of mother-figure who, in denial and resentment, seeing &quot;nothing, nothing at all...&quot; As the boat ride turns to DOPE HAT, the Great Hoodoo performs a feast of prestidigitation, but we all know as the audience that the hat is actually &quot;wearing him.&quot; GET YOUR GUNN is of a young girl's witness to the abuse at the hands of her father and the fake (pseudo) morals that fills her home, she urges her mother to just &quot;get your gunn&quot;... WRAPPED IN PLASTIC shares a similar topic as a denial-stricken mother does not see the incest going on in her own home done by her husband, the lies are simply &quot;wrapped in plastic&quot;. The emotionally charged rollercoaster advances to DOGMA which urges one to simply &quot;burn your witches and bridges&quot; for you can decide your own fate, but not your hate. The seduction of SWEET TOOTH then shows the control that lust can have over a male and how some of them then fail to control their own actions, like a disease which is draining them. SNAKE EYES AND SISSIES is then an attack at the typical American beer-drinking, wife-beating male who always thinks it matters if his car is bigger then his neighbor's and that he's got the upper hand in his family. The nightmare continues into MY MONKEY, a demented cover of a Charles Manson song sung by an electronically enhanced Manson's voice to sound like a child singing about his dead monkey... or is it really dead? MISERY MACHINE then comes speeding down the lane, but it does not hold the Scooby-Doo gang. This menacing vehicle is on the way to &quot;the Abbey of Thelema&quot; and it is &quot;fueled by filth and fury&quot;... blood is pavement. As the album closes with a paranoid housewife screaming words of anti-comunism and hatred towards a child's parents, the a phone rings for about 6 long minutes, when finally a message is left by a disgruntled parent who's son apparently listens to Marilyn Manson.<BR>An odd first album indeed, it is still a must for Manson fans or for those interested in exactly what Manson's view of the so-called &quot;American Family&quot; actually is... obviously from the content of the songs... it doesn't look like the Cleavers... and indeed, was it ever?
B0000E1ALR|5.0|So many great hits, he always comes back again to amaze me. You should check out genie, she does some work similar to Bruce, search for Genie in amazon.
B00005JMFR|2.0|This review contains spoilers... However, if they prevent you from watching the film, consider that a good thing. You'd be better off if I just told you how it ended and saved you two hours of your life.<br />A horrible sense of disillusion dawned on me as I watched this third installment in the oversized Matrix trilogy. Suddenly I realized how trite and unoriginal the pseudo-philosophical concepts that guided the story were. These are the same concepts that the first two movies in the series followed, but this time it's much more obvious than ever before. The first film in the series, while not as original in conception as it seemed to me back then, had sparks of uniqueness and originality like few other movies - perhaps not in its concept but certainly in its writing, styling, and cinematography. The second one, while it didn't have that same spark, still managed to be satisfactory by incorporating several action scenes of immense originality and uniqueness in their styling and visualization. This third film doesn't even have that. I won't go against sequels and trilogies in general, because classics like Star Wars and The Godfather, not to mention more modern examples like Lord of the Rings and Kill Bill, could have never reached their full depth in only one film, but a filmmaker shouldn't have to do three films when he said all he had to say in the first one.<br />First, we have an impressive but rather pointless fight sequence in the Merovingian's bar. It might have been fitting for an opener if the rest of the film was more impressive. The mythological and theological hints in that scene are so obvious and overwhelming (the club is hell, the Merovingian is Hades, the Trainman is the Ferryman), yet they lead nowhere. Much more coherent were the creepy sadism-masochism not-so-subtle hints; but whether that was meant to have some meaning, or just to satisfy Larry Wachowski's odd passions, I don't know. The character of Seraph - `The Wingless Angel' - seems to bebuilding towards something, but reaches no conclusion. This is one of many openings the trilogy leaves that make me fear a spin-off, an animated series or perhaps awful second-rate books written by fanboys like the ones Star Trek got. The scene in the train station is probably the best part of the movie, and I liked the low-key, minimal production feel of it. It got dwarfed, however, next to the laughs I got from the scene in which Trinity and Morpheus meet the Oracle - Mary Alice. The Wachowskis were at a loss as to how deal with the death of actress Gloria Foster, and did less than well in the ridiculous solution they came up with. I think I would have liked it better if the Oracle became a thin, young, blonde woman; that would at least show some guts.<br />The battle for Zion was of course impressive, but to me it seemed like little more than a big screen computer game. The whole thing was badly unconvincing, especially those MACH style Starship Troopers rip-off robots the rebels use. And since the directors created in me absolutely zero emotional connection to either Zion or any of the people in it (were we supposed to become emotionally attached to Zion after that horrible orgy/rave scene in the second movie? If so, badly done) I simply didn't care about the outcome. An important part of good sci-fi writing is, since the viewer obviously has no empathy for the characters or places beforehand, to make him care about them. Matrix Revolutions didn't do that. Zee, Link, Lock and all of these half-baked characters introduced to us in the second film are uninteresting and unimportant. That entire battle was too long and very dull.<br />As for the other big showdown - the battle between Neo and Smith... Neo already battled with Smith in the first and second movie, and both of these scenes were original and impressive. The duel in the first movie was wonderfully directed and choreographed, while the battle between Neo and the multiple Smiths in The Matrix Reloaded wasoriginal and exciting. This final battle is none of the above; it's dull, predictable and unimpressive, using every cliché imaginable. It consists mainly of Smith knocking Neo down and Neo getting up again, over and over. And let's not even discuss Trinity's horrible, oversized, melodramatic and pathetic death scene which would have made Wagner blush.<br />Another thing I realized watching this movie is that the only character in the entire trilogy that I really cared for, that really had a personality and characterization, was Agent Smith. Hugo Weaving is, I now realize, a fantastic actor, and he created a truly timeless and unique character. I also loved his real-world incarnation as Bane; I could see it was Smith long before he gave himself away with that `Mr. Anderson' remark. Could you possibly have recognized Neo or Trinity had they stumbled into another body? Smith is the only major creation which made the expansion of the series somewhat worthwhile. Morpheus was an interesting character in the first movie, but I could never forgive him after that horrible, hilarious speech he gave in Zion in the beginning of part 2. As for Neo, he was never very interesting since he became the One - I liked him better when he was a confused, clueless hacker. Despite any enjoyment I got from the second movie, the series would probably have been better off ending there.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|i'm not really understanding how you people can sit at your computer and write crap like i have seen in some reviews. this is the best perfect circle yet, and to those who are comparing them to tool, they are so totally different than tool that they simply cannot be compared, they are two totally different types of music. maynard's vocals on this one really amazed me, and adding a little jordy white into the mix can only make things better as his 5 string thunderously takes charge leading the guitar riffs this time, instead of it being the other way around. a very very solid cd, and if possible go see them live, they have improved their performance quite a bit. buy this cd, i promise you that you will not regret it.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Best thing about TOT is that it is provoking such a strong and wide reaction among listeners/reviewers. What this means is that DT have made an album that engages the listener, and that to me is DT's trademark. Also, I really like the spontaneity of the songs---more open structures, long solos, fast recording time. It's a nice change of pace from the longer SFAM/6D style.<br />These songs sound like blueprints for the live versions, so I'm already looking forward to the 2004 tour. \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" in particular sounds like it's going to translate really well in concert. Love TOT or hate it, the music is doing its job!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Wow seven years, sounds very nice, I've always known of this artist named Genie, she sounds very similar to Norah, you should check her out on amazon, just search for Genie.<BR>     I LOVE YOU NORAH
B000066NW0|4.0|I'll admit, Avril can't sing very well in real life. I've heard her on several late night shows and she sounds horrible. On the CD however she sounds fantasic. It doesn't really bother me because the CD is enjoyable to listen to and has great songs. If you've ruled out this Cd because of her live tv performances you should reconsider. I look forward to her next CD, but I don't plan to ever buy tickets to her concert.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|still their new release is awful... this shows how bad 6doit is! dream theater has become a shadow of their former selves. dream theater is not a thrash or industrial sounding band, so they should stop pretending they are one and write the kind of music they are best at (like those on i&amp;w, awake). james labrie has gotten so annoying on the vocals, and he should stop trying to sound like hetfield. too bad another band has gone down the drain!
B000002SYG|5.0|I bought this CD for five bucks, and you certainly cannot go wrong with a price like that.  This CD has all of CC's hits, including the critically panned Top 40 single, &quot;The War Song&quot;.  <br />I always liked that song, and never understood why it was so hated.  Yet listening to the song nowadays, it takes on a whole new meaning, and is still an enjoyable, yet politically-charged, song.  <br />Of course, you also have other classics like &quot;Time (Clock of the Heart)&quot; (a favourite), &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot; and the lovely ballad, &quot;Victims&quot;.
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido does it yet again, she always comes out with the most revoultionary albums. Another artist i found that i like would be Genie, her stuff is very similar to Dido, and i think whoever likes dido would like Genie, check her out on amazon, just search for genie.<BR>    DIDO 4 LIFE
B000002HH9|2.0|I own every Cure album, and I love all of them...except this one. I've had this album since the day it came out, and despite all the negative reviews and terrible things said about it, I gave it a very fair chance. It's really not as bad as SOME people say. I mean at least The Cure are still trying new things musically. Problem is, a lot of these melodies just aren't very good at all. \\"Want\\", \\"Bare\\" and \\"Jupiter Crash\\" are incredible, and easily the best songs on here. The other decent ones, \\"This Is A Lie\\", \\"Mint Car\\", and \\"Return\\", are still not that great. But \\"Round & Round & Round\\", \\"Gone\\", \\"Club America\\", \\"Strange Attraction\\", and \\"Trap\\" make me wonder how Robert Smith could even listen to those songs, much less over and over again during recording sessions! Then there's \\"The 13th\\" which stands alone with it's dumb melody, but interesting carribean musings. I guess it's okay, there's nothing awful about it. And \\"Numb\\", the same way...nothing great about that song, but then nothing about it stands out or drags me in, it's just sort of there. And I know how a lot of fans of this album like \\"Treasure\\" and it's okay, but after a while it just bores me. So yeah, this one's a miss. For all the reviews I've read that suggest that the reason this album gets a bad rap is because of all the goth-purists who don't like it cause it's pop, I'm no goth purist, in fact I love all the pop stuff they've done, EXCEPT this album! Personally, I consider this the worst Cure album because I think The Cure's usual outstanding talents in the mood, melody and lyrics departments are lacking here. Most bands that have been around for this long end up putting out a few albums that aren't very good. Well this is the Cure's one miss so far.
B000069HZP|4.0|THE GAME is definitely a director's movie.  David Fincher (Seven, Panic Room, Fight Club) propels us into the nightmarish world of Michael Douglas' Scroogish investment banker.  Nicholas is cold; lonely; bearing a lot of anguish over the suicide of his father, the seeming failure of his brother (Sean Penn in a rather small role, almost overacting, but tolerable).  What in this movie is real and what is a game?  The use of news commentator Daniel Schorr to set the rules for Douglas is very good, and unique.  Deborah Kara Unger fills the role of Christine nicely, although sometimes she seems in a vague fog.  Peter Donat as Douglas' lawyer is sturdy; James Rebhorn as the smarmy employee of CRS is also good.<br />The movie rests on Douglas' shoulders and thought it may be a combination of his other roles, he still does a commendable job in carrying the movie.  It is bizarre, nightmarish, ominous and a director's triumph.  Some of the things that go on toward the end of the movie and stretch the credibility factor, but I can't divulge those without spoiling the ending.<br />A good film, inventive and well done.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Wow! What an awesome CD. When I first bought it, it was the only cd I listened to for two months. When I started listening to the normal Metallica songs, w/o San Fransisco Symphony, the songs sounded ALMOST, but not quite, incomplete! Although several classics were missing, like Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Ride the Lightning, and Fade to Black (to name a few). Other than that, it's amazing. The stuff that is there is incredible! I think I'm going to buy the DVD next! And you should buy this CD!
B0000CAQ26|5.0|Pink's new CD heads in a different direction than her first 2 CD's but with the same result...great music.  The harder beats provided by Tim Armstrong still seem interesting and catchy with Pink's lyrics and vocals.  Pink's in your face attitude on this album comes through on almost all of her songs.  <br />While all the songs have great lyrics and catchy hooks as well as verses my personal favorites are:<br />Last To Know-extremely catchy song, one of my faves, but the song is about a friend of hers that she calls a stupid f*** just because he miss one of her shows.<br />God Is A DJ-Awesome upbeat track, for the people who like her more dance-friendly music.<br />On My God-fun song, great touch to add Peaches. <br />Catch Me While I'm Sleeping-a great ballad, best Linda Perry/Pink calabo on the album.<br />Waiting For Love-my personal favorite song on the album, at the beginning the verses and the B-section builds up beautifully to the amazing chorus, which sends chills down my back.  Surprised more people aren't talking about this track.  <br />Humble Neighborhood-very unique song, chantlike &quot;we don't wanna go home.&quot;<br />Walk Away-definitely one of the more radio friendly songs on this album, but I love the verses.
B0000C0FJB|2.0|I know I had written a good review for this before but that's because i had just spent a lot of money on it and i was telling myself it was good. The band sounds like background music as you hear the audience louder and like another reviewer said it sounds like Geddy is singing with a pillow over his face.
0688163173|4.0|Before this book, I read two of Dennis Lehane's previous books, &quot;A Drink Before the War&quot; (very disappointing) and &quot;Mystic River&quot; (good, but not great).  Based upon some reviews, I anticipated liking this book much more than the previous two.  I was right.<br />I liked &quot;Shutter Island&quot; much more than &quot;Mystic River&quot; but I gave them both the same scores (4 out of 5).  The only thing that kept &quot;Shutter Island&quot; from garnering a 5 was that I figured out the major &quot;mystery&quot; halfway through the book.  Frankly, I'm surprised that not too many other people seem to have caught onto what was happening.  To me, it was quite obvious.<br />Regardless, knowing the major &quot;twist&quot; didn't prevent me from enjoying the book.  Although it won't have you on the edge of your seat desperately anticipating each turn of the page, it's a fairly fast read and an enjoyable one.<br />Out of the three Lehane novels I've read thus far, this is easily his best one in my opinion (though it's quite different in style from the previous two I've read).<br />Recommended.
B00005B1EX|5.0|Finally, a concert epic worthy of the Judas Priest mystique!  Having seen Judas Priest live three different times I feel I have a special background when it comes to a live document of what Rob Halford brought to the arena.  This is as close as any long-time fan can get without actually being there.  The energy level is extremely high, and the newer songs, taken from Halford's &quot;Resurrection,&quot; all soar with passion and vitality.  The songs taken from the JP catalog all shine.  From &quot;Stained Class&quot; to &quot;Genocide&quot; come special moments of unbridled nostalgia.  For all the Gen-Xers out there:  Crank this CD up to eleven and let your ears bleed!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I'm a 54 year old pianist....played organ in a rock band in the 60's....had a great rock and roll reunion gig in '99 with same band members....music is a huge part of my life...all kinds of music.  My wife of 33 years and I went to see Paul McCartney's show in Denver and OK City...twice in one year....fantastic! We're not wealthy people....we don't go to many concerts...we need to be pretty selective.  After purchasing Josh's Pasadena concert DVD, we decided that if he would ever do a tour, we'd go without a doubt! And after buying his latest CD...well....we just purchased four tickets for Josh's show in Denver on Feb 6th!!!  Can't wait to hear this young PHENOMENON....LIVE!  I love Rock and Roll, but I'm also a sucker for a good orchestra...good mid-range piano with a GREAT VOICE.  Josh is a great inspiration for me.....he is a quality act!  He seems to be such a breath of fresh air in the music industry today.   The world needs to hear the voice of Josh Groban for many, many years to come.  His second CD &quot;Closer&quot; is everything I hoped it would be!  More POWER TO JOSH!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Afterglow is an amazing cd. My only complaint is that there are only 10 songs. Sarah's voice is just as beautiful and soothing as ever. My favorites are &quot;fallen&quot;, &quot;drifting&quot;, and &quot;train wreck&quot;. It is good to hear some new stuff from Sarah. This would also be a good intro cd for those who are not familiar with Sarah's other cds.
B00006BTCA|1.0|IAN CURTIS WAS A ROCK GOD and nobody but his family and band members should be allowed to make money from his creations. <br />Interpol are a talented bunch of kids with good taste in music who should have directed their talent into creating something new instead of RIPPING OFF JOY DIVISION!<br />Hopefully the talent they show with TOTBL develops, and that with maturity they will find their own voice. I've got my fingered crossed for them.<br />But in the end I completely agree with the one reviewer - If you want to hear Joy Division, listen to Joy Division!
B0000DJZA0|5.0|This is Coldplay at its best, live! I was a bit hesitant in buying another Coldplay CD with the the same songs that I have on several other CDs, but the boys don't dissappoint here. The fact that the CD was recorded live just adds another layer of depth and emotion to what I thought were already terrific tracks. The DVD is probably one of the best produced music DVD's that I've seen to date. Way to go Coldplay!
B0000CAQ27|3.0|First off, I'd like 2 say that I'm a big P!nk fan..but I'm not always a fan of her musical choices. She tells us  she doesn't wanna be put in any category and WHO can blame her? Nobody really does. But being the hip-hop/R&B fan that I am I can't help but feel cheated by P!nk rediscovering her punk/rock roots. I mean don't get me wrong, if that's her thing..that's HER thing!!! Way before Justin Timberlake, she was breaking down musical \\"color lines\\" and allowed others to follow suit. But I think someone with that much talent and such a powerful soulful voice doesn't belong singing hard rock songs.  Being that as it may, I think that's exactly what carried me through this album was that amazing voice. Her songwriting craft is  somewhat stronger on this album, but they are not necessarily songs written about her own personal experience like those on her last album \\"M!ssundaztood\\", they're actually alot funner not as depressing..hehe. There are actually 2 R&B laced tracks \\"Catch me while I'm Sleeping\\" and \\"love song\\" written for her boyfriend Carey Hart that made me think maybe P!nk hasn't totally given up on that genre.They were also actually some more punk/rock/new wave type songs like \\" Humble Neighborhoods\\" and \\"Last to know\\".. that really got me shakin'. But the song I personally think will be a hit for her will be her next single to follow the mediocre \\"Trouble\\" called \\"God is a DJ\\". The lyrics and hook are quite unique and will probably be played to death in the clubs. All in all, not being a big  rock fan P!nk does really make you believe that we are all pink inside.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I'm glad to see Sarah McLachlan finally releasing new material.  The songs on this CD are good overall, but after a while, they tend to blend together.  There's just not much differentiation in the CD, and the lyrics, while poetic, seem more vanilla than on her past CDs.  High points: Fallen, and World on Fire.
B00005A1PR|2.0|&quot;Video&quot; highlighted my expectations to this album, Video it's such a great song, great message, and makes you remember of the good music that was use to be made, but it's a fact that most of the rest of the album is pretty boring and forgettable.  The worth tracks here are the leading single &quot;Video&quot; and &quot;Streght, Courage and Wisdom&quot;.  Sadly I have to say that the cover of the album stands out, but the music not.
B000059MEK|1.0|If you are seriously considering Daft Junk, then just go ahead and waste your money on Britney or Madonna.....
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Thank god the wait is finally over!  If you are new to Godsmack, I would have to say start off with this cd.  Then Awake, then self-titled.  It opens with there first single &quot;Straight out of Line&quot; and closes with there current single &quot;Serenity&quot;, and smack dab in the middle &quot;Re-Align&quot; (which is being released as a single).  With the information I have provided, I see theres no reason not to invest in this compact disc, believe me its worth the time and money.  Also look for THE OTHERSIDE being released sometime in November/December.  Which of course is an acoustic album, but like always I'm sure it will kick @$$!  So far this IS the best release of 2003...

B00005YW4H|5.0|I truly enjoy Norah Jones's &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; because the entire album is so soothing and relaxing. Her voice is sultry, and it seems as though she sings effortlessly. My favorite pieces are &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, &quot;Seven Years&quot; and &quot;Lone Star.&quot; I love the piano arragements in this album as I feel that it provides a great complement to Norah's unique voice. A newcomer to the music scene, she won a total of five Grammy Awards this year with her debut album.  This album is great for an evening of rest and relaxation. Also, I played this album on a road trip, and I must say, the music was just right for such a long journey. The daughter of Ravi Shankar, the legendary sitar musician, she is extremely talented and I am eagerly waiting for her next album.
B00008973Q|5.0|While reading the angry rant from the gentleman from Johannesburg, a question crossed my mind: Dear reviewer, when stating your case, is it asking too much that you get the most simple facts straight, or are you so consumed with unhinged vitriol that making assertions that are truthful is utterly beyond your capacity? Just wondering.<br />You state - with some angry, seething \\"ALL-CAPS\\" thrown in - that Kurosawa's films were unpopular and \\"despised\\" in his home country. It fascinates me that a person would publicly embarrass themself by getting things so wrong. Where to start? 1952's \\"Ikiru\\" was such a huge popular success that it gave Kurosawa the clout to complete \\"Seven Samurai\\" - which ran over-schedule and over-budget - where it subsequently was a phenomenal box-office hit. Other huge popular successes included \\"The Hidden Fortress,\\" \\"Yojimbo,\\" and \\"Red Beard.\\" In 1979, a group of Japanese critics and artists voted \\"Seven Samurai\\" the all-time greatest Japanese film, with over twice the votes of the runner-up, \\"Tokyo Story\\" (a fine, heartfelt film in its own right).<br />Regarding Ran, the film is an epic, visionary masterwork that stands as a fitting culmination of Kurosawa's career. Although intelligent, well-reasoned dissenting opinions certainly exist, I'm afraid that such thunderous, fulminating hatred of the late Kurosawa such as appears on this page is not only misguided, but will take years off of one's lifespan.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|What a GREAT cd Sarah has released, it was well-worth the wait!  Everyone should have this CD in their collection!  It is classis to Sarah's style and her talent shines through as it always does!  This is a must have!
B00005Y6YB|1.0|According to Amazon.com's &quot;technical details&quot; link for this item, the total run time is 240 minutes.  According to IMDB, the miniseries first broadcast in 1989 runs 384 minutes.  This jives with my recollection of four two-hour episodes, with commercials, broadcast in the winter of early 1989.  <br />So YES, this is an edited version:  Almost 2-1/2 hours have been removed.  That seems a fairly severe abridgement.  I wouldn't consider buying such a chop-up of this great, great Western.  Five stars for the original film, one star for chainsaw editing.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Persuasion is a masterpiece of subtlety, a fine example of <BR>the kind of film that can be made when all involved place <BR>quality over market value. The film is not for the dense, as it requires patience and the understanding of an era, challenging viewers to read the subtext and to listen to Austen's richly written characters. Notice (those who've seen the film many times) how lines giving away important details are thrown away, spoken in a matter-of-fact manner, so easy to miss if you're not paying close attention. It took me several viewings to <BR>grasp every detail of the story (haven't read the book). <br />In fact, it took me a couple of viewings to even like the film, much less love it as I do now!<BR>I wanted it so much to be as electrifying as Pride and Prejudice. I wanted fireworks from these two lovers, the kind of impassioned conversations you'd hear from Miss Bennett and Mr. Darcy. But it's just not that kind of romance. Anne and Wentworth have a private and painful history that nobody seems to understand but them. There is the surface knowledge between the other characters, but then such a heavy, quiet knowledge between the main two. They are NOT meant to engage in a battle of wits or lash out at one another in fits of anger. They are meant to rekindle the deep, meaningful feelings they once had for each other, but delicately, gradually, and almost as secretly as their initial engagement. <br />Amazing how this dashing, macho Captain of the Navy becomes stifled around Anne. Love is so much scarier to him than any sea battle. At first he is aloof, avoids her, downright ignores her. He comes around so gradually, yet so inevitably, as does Anne's soul. And nobody notices the reasons for their respective transformations, their growing attachment, but them. Their affection for one another is their own little secret shared only with the most sensitive viewer. <br />I urge those who didn't like it to watch it again. There is so much beauty and grace in this film. It is a rare and genuine treasure.
B00005JLTN|1.0|Why in God's name would you buy this, or any other DVD for that matter, in full-screen as opposed to widescreen.  If you consider buying this visually stunning movie in full-screen, please send me the money instead, since you are just throwing away your hard-earned cash.<br />Long live anamorphic widescreen!!!!!
0066214122|3.0|Crichton's latest novel (as of this review) is not his best by far, but still provides hours of reading entertainment if you can suspend your disbelief. I may be spoiled after having read Timeline by him, but this one didn't quite show off his usual writing genius.<br />No spoilers here, but think of this book as Jurassic Park on the microscopic level. The main group of characters is trapped in a secluded area. If caught, they'll be killed by the predator. How can they get away? Does this entire plot sound familiar?<br />Crichton appears to be writing a screenplay in book form in order to re-capitalize on the Jurassic Park popularity of former years. Sure it is fun and entertaining, but I was hoping for something a little more original.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Been listening to this a lot lately, so its time to chime in.  THis is undoubtedly the Smashing Pumpkins best work.  Mellon Collie, while not short on excellent songs, was long on filler, and lacked the shimmery guitar bliss that is Butch Vig's production.  No one seems to mention his contribution to this album, but producers rarely get credit anyway.  His extremely hard yet entirely accessible production gave this album the pop listenability that it needed to reach a large audience, but not at the expense of the hard rock ... that Corgan was so good at.  That said, Corgan is a guitar solo master, blasting out mindblowing fret work all over the place.  I was never a fan of his lyrics, too angsty and overwrought for me.  So I think its wise that he lets them sit just underneath the guitar madness.  Only letting them come up for a brief poetic line in the slow songs.  And while I'm on the slow songs, I always wanted Sweet Sweet to go on longer, its the most beautiful song on the album by far to me, and I wanted it fleshed out, I don't know what happened with this.  Although I guess I got a whole album of this on Adore.  But in terms of rocking hard without being vapid it doesn't get much better than this, Cherub Rock and Today are just classics.  Soma, Mayonaise, and Hummer are wonderous epics.  Its all here.  Someone should tell the current batch of \\"metalheads\\" that its not shameful to be pop.  Ask Corgan.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Where to start? Hmm. I have owned this album since the day it came out, and just like ALL of you should have done, I waited until now to review it. Every album of epic proportions needs to be soaked up. Submersing yourself in it is the ONLy way. <br /> This album is LEAPS and BOUNDS ahead of Mer De Noms. Yes, that album rocked harder, but Maynards vocals and production talents scream through this time around. As far as I know, Maynard ran the show, and I can't believe they would do it any other way. <br /> I love every TOOL album, hell, everything MAYNARD, but this is by far my fav. He shows a vocal range never reached before, and proves he is the most creative artist alive today. I get chills every time I put it on while studying, typing, working, working out, whatever. If you are slamming this disc, then you just arent a Maynard fan, or a music fan for that matter. I recommend Nickelback in that case.<br /> As far as the stand out tracks, right now I am digging &quot;Gravity,&quot; &quot;Vanishing,&quot; and &quot;The Package.&quot; Do yourself a favor and enlighten your life with MJK and APC. Sounds like a prescription, eh?
B00005JMFO|5.0|There are many great reviews of this movie already so I won't be repetitious.  It IS a must-see, even for it's shortcomings and America bashing in a few scenes.  America, after all, is a giant now-formidible presence.  I think it's natural for someone to want to bash us.<br />I'm getting off the track.  See this wonderful movie and judge for yourself.  It is R rated so keep that in mind for the children.  I can't imagine how any adult, male or female, would be disappointed!
630382790X|5.0|Apollo 13, the story of NASA's near-loss of one of its manned spacecraft in 1970, is on my top-five list of all-time favorite movies.  This, for me, is one of those movies that I've see a million times, know all the words to and get everyone whose watching it with me annoyed because I HAVE TO say the lines along with the actors.  The acting in the movie is fantastic...everyone from Tom Hanks to Ed Harris on down the list superbly act this true event from our nation's history.  Even the background music is great...seamlessly fitting into the mood of the movie.  Annie Lennox does the vocalizations, and her voice is, as always, immensely powerful.<br />As someone who craves the day when this nation returns to the resolve it had in the 1960's and early 70's when we were shooting for the moon, the story of Apollo 13 should inspire those who yearn for humanity's renewed interest in exploring the immensity of what lays beyond our small planet, not just with robotic devices, but with people as well.  Apollo 13's failure to land on the moon, and near-loss, should prove to humanity that from failure, we can still triumph.  That is something that I think we have forgotten today...especially after the loss of the Shuttle Columbia, we have nearly forgotten the incredible risk of exploring space is more than worth the benefits we will reap with our explorations...even when some do not return home.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|One of the best comic book movies to come out in the past few years. As much as the Matrix movies are \\"comic book movies\\"(utilizing comic book style action, plot devices, visual influences) I personally have found the X-men series of movies more satisfying and relevant.  The director has decided to take the subversive route, forcing the audience to become invested in the characters and their respective plights.  This in turn gives purpose to the action sequences in which they are allowed to serve the progression of the story rather then as a distraction from a threadbare plot.  <br />As much as I enjoyed the first Matrix, the subsequent Matrix sequels have become overloaded with gratuitous action sequences, seemingly the result of the filmmakers' overindulgent tendencies or perhaps their misconceptions about what pleases an audience.  I want to see a good film, which is exactly the criterion X2 fulfills.  The pacing is effective, the themes have resonance and the ensemble cast interacts with playful chemistry and energy. Take Hugh Jackman's excellent characterization of Wolverine; oscillating from feral animal ready to consume helpless prey one minute to concerned parental figure the next.  Famke Janssen as Jean Grey is also excellent (her film Love & Sex is also highly recommended). One of the industry's most underrated actresses Famke conveys mouthfuls with a singular glance.  <br />I also like the wide age ranges possessed by all the mutants in the film. The old aren't relegated to grandfather roles and the young play integral parts in the stories action. A 60-year-old Magneto, played by the regal Ian Mckellan, believably evokes fear all the way up to the highest tier of American government due to his mutant control of all things metallic.  Mutation as the great equalizer between the young, old, men, women, strong and weak is a great concept.<br />In short: Great Cast, Great Execution, Great Film.
B00006BTCA|1.0|Remember the record store in Pretty in Pink? Or how about the one in High Fidelty? I have a friend who runs one that's like a combination of those 2. Just the kind of place all us record /music fiends would like to spend our days and nights. <br />He will NOT carry Interpol and will willingly and intelligently give his reasons to anyone who asks. He has even gone on to hold top 10 \\"Why Interpol Sucks\\" days with free CD giveaways to people with the funniest lists. I'd say that's a great way (and pretty darned funny too) to warn the buying public to not waste their money. <br />Personally I find Interpol's music to be tolerable. They're decent musicians in a way. But it just doesn't do it for me. I mean I'm not saying the reason has to do with any of these immature arguments over comparisons. It just doesn't work for me. I feel that I'm very open minded and made a strong effort to listen to TOTBL 2 times all the way through all alone before I let myself pass any judgment as to what I'd heard. I just let myself hear the music. That's all. I just listened. Mind you this was before my friend started his Anti-Interpol campaign, so don't think that was any influence. I do very much so enjoy just about every one of the other bands mentioned in all these reviews and to do those reviewers justice, can kind of understand all their complaints. I don't say they represent my opinions but I can understand them. On the other hand I can't agree at all with all the \\"Best Album of the Year\\" comments. If you could prove you'd listened to the thousands of releases in 2002 and had any kind of musical sense, I could let you go but give me a break will you. Interpol, in their way, are ok, but I won't give them any more than those 2 listens. Glad I borrowed the CD and didn't pay for it myself. My friend would never let me live it down!
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Let's face it.  This movie was made solely for the money it would bring in.  There's almost no thought evident in the creative process.  It's sad that something this bad can come from a movie that was so good.  Just goes to show what greed does to art.
B00005JM02|5.0|The story and the wonderful performances by the actors portraying the fish are only surpassed by the stunning visual effects. I loved this movie and it has a great family story without being syrupy sweet. A shoo in for the Academy award this year.
B000001FMX|5.0|Half-Rolling Stones , half-Sex Pistols , New York Dolls is definitly a band you need to check out . Their debut album , full of life , energy and enthusiasm , is exactly what Rock'n Roll should have never ceased to be . Critics often say that The Stooges are the godfathers of Punk , yet many songs on this record sound exactly like what The Ramones , The Pistols (and even The Clash on \\"Trash\\") would do years later . <br />\\"Personality Crisis\\" and \\"Jet Boy\\" are probably the greatest tracks , but all the songs are pretty good and often catchy . A very good CD overall .
B00003OSU4|5.0|Bert Stern has both an eye and an ear for jazz, par excellence, capturing the spirit of the Newport Jazz festival in its heyday.  This is a wonderful showcase of performances, ranging from the detached Thelonius Monk to the super cool Anita O'Day.  But, without doubt, the performance that stands out is that of Mahalia Jackson who brings the crowd to their feet with &quot;40 Days&quot; and then brings them to their knees with her closing psalm, so passionately felt.<br />The movie takes you through a figurative day, capturing the sea air of Newport, the quiet practice sessions, the ebb and flow of the crowd as it grows to its evening peak, with a rocking performance by Chuck Berry.  The Satchmo takes a wonderful turn at the mike with Jack Teargarden joining him in a fun duet.  Chico Hamilton is there in all his seriousness with Eric Dolphy highlighting the band's performance. George Shearer looks like he could be playing at the Hollywood Bowl.<br />I was hoping for more extras on the DVD.  The movie leaves you craving for more music. The 50's were the peak of the hip jazz scene and this movie is as hip as they come.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|If you have a love for good music this is the Cd to buy. Get Born is a great rock album. It has a variety of soudn but still within the realm of rock. They sound almost classical but still hip. I definatly suggest buying it today. If you liek the White Stripes or Oasis, you will love jet.
B00005JMFO|5.0|When my wife said she really wanted to see \\"Love Actually\\", I was indifferent, not overly anxious to go sit in a theater and watch another \\"chick-flick\\", but equally uninterested in spending a night home alone-and so we went.<br />I have to confess, it was a great film.<br />The premise is a bunch of individual relationships reflecting the many facets of love.  At one end of the spectrum, there is the dignified, new elected Prime Minister of England, (Hugh Grant), who is at once smitten with one of the many assistants working in his office.  At the other end there is a brash, aging rock star, whose self indulgent lifestyle and brazen behavior has made him a loner, never having found true love.  In between are seven other relationships-newlyweds, an old married couple struggling with fidelity, a husband whose wife has recently died leaving him with a step-son he hardly knows, a man who struggles with bachelorhood after he catches his wife sleeping with his brother, a young couple who meet on the set of a movie they are both \\"starring\\" in, a woman who struggles with approaching a man she has secretly loved for years, and a young man who sets out for the United States in search of the other great American dream-dating a supermodel.<br />The movie is fun and funny, at once touching and satirical, painting a vivid portrait of the many struggles every individual and couple faces throughout the course of their particular lives and in the life they share with one another.  The film has a very warm feel to it, and really touches on the many issues that love carries with it.  It is great for men and women alike.  For the men, the story touches on the many challenges we all experience in trying to live up to the expectations, demands and needs of the women we love.  For women, it has the warmth of romance, combined with the reality of the imperfections men never see in themsleves.  Surely, this film is a reminder that all relationships, even the great ones, have flaws, speed-bumps and little curves that nobody can expect or see until they encounter them.  Whats more, this film is genuinely funny, and will leave the audience laughing as they exit the theater. <br />Rated R for sexuality, nudity and language, the movie should be reserved for older viewers.  The R rating is there with good reason and should not be ignored.  This is not a film for children, and it is doubtful that children would enjoy this as much as the more \\"mature\\" audience for which the film is intended.  <br />So men, fear not, this movie isn't just for women, you will enjoy it as much, if not more, than they do.  Go see it, I promise you won't be disappointed.<br />Scott Kolecki
0091779251|4.0|Robert Harris' venture into the world of Imperial Rome provides a different slant on the usual historical method of fiction. More concerned with the engineering of the Aqua Augusta (the longest aqueduct in Italy at the time) seen through the eyes of its Aquarius - Marius Attilius Primus - the novel moves away from providing excitement through historical fictionalisation to a quiet retelling of one the ancient world's most famous cataclysms in a manner that touches on the style of a modern-day disaster novel.<BR>I suspect that a Robert Harris fan and a Roman historical fan who has not read Harris before will review this offering rather differently. The only flaw I felt with this novel was that (approaching it as a historical fiction fan and being the first of Harris' books I have read) its `new' style made it, initially, all the more intriguing and readable. Yet, by the end I felt that Harris had missed one of the tenets of historical fiction - namely to ensure its main protagonists are given a vibrancy and life that makes us want to read about them. Whilst several of the supporting actors, Ampliatus and Pliny to be precise, achieved this our main `hero', for whom Harris goes to great lengths to stress his intellectual, honest and almost stoic mindset ends up being a character that we `watch' rather than `follow'. At a technical level the contrasting characterisations are excellent and clearly display Harris' class and ability to understand how to write a novel, but his literary expertise has meant the empathy with the main character is minimal at best. Simply put, the novel could have been so much more. <BR>The story concerns the newly promoted Aquarius in charge of the aqueduct whom we find on the opening day searching for spring water and discovering very quickly that a breach in the aqueduct around the area of Vesuvius has both contaminated the water and then prevented its flow. In a humanising touch our erstwhile hero leaps to rescue a hapless slave who is beingkilled at Misenum's Villa Hortensia by the  owner, freedman Numerius Popidius Ampliatus (who controls the surrounding areas through his plutocracy and also has the best line in the entire novel on page 134 of the hardback version: \\"there's no safer investment than property in Pompeii\\") after his prized red mullet fish are found floating in their pool. To complete the introduction we are offered a tantalising sub-plot love theme with the introduction of his eighteen year old daughter, Corelia, the usual struggle to assert himself over his new team with the oversee Corax leaping on every chance to undermine him, and a mystery in the disappearance of the previous Aquarius, Exomnius.<BR>After explaining to the historical Pliny the Elder his beliefs, Marius sails at all speed to Pompeii to locate the fault in the Augusta and gets tied up in Ampliatus' obseqiuous and mendacious generosity whilst searching out the truth behind Exomnius' disappearance. This we eventually discover and a disappointing  sense of anti-climax arrives when we discover how and why he has disappeared. Corelia runs away to tell Marius that her father wants him dead, leading to the inevitable showdown with Corax. So, after two thirds of the novel, we come to the eruption where Harris focuses on fictionalising the Younger Pliny's letters, following Pliny as he tries to save the people fleeing Herculaneum and Pompeii, eventually dying on the beach at Stabiae and then follows Marius' herculean efforts as he races to Pompeii to save Corelia which he does in neat fashion using the Aqua Augusta as a means of escaping.<BR>I just felt that Harris' was more concerned with writing about the technical aspects of ancient engineering and vulcanology than giving due attention to character empathy. Given everyone knows the main plot then the focus (and thereby the interest) had to be on the sub plots which are a tad cliched and weak. It is particularly emphasized at the very end when the eruption ends and so doesthe book, somewhat abruptly. <BR>So, extremely well written, historically and scientifically accurate, the characterisations are very good and precise, but....whilst what we are given character-wise is good, it is not enough and results in a lack of empathy from the reader. For any fan of Roman historical fiction this is worth reading as the quality of the author shines through and the narrative style is very different to the usual offerings...it is just that, by the end, it could have been a McCullough...but didn't aspire to those dizzy heights.
B0000CFW87|1.0|This bozo is absolutely horrible.  His fans are the kind of people who collect stuffed animals and Troll dolls, and hang posters of unicorns and rainbows on their walls.  If I go to Hell, I can only *hope* that Slayer is on the soundtrack; I fear, however, that I would be forced to spend all of eternity listening to Josh Groban.
B000000XB9|5.0|I could listen to this collection over and over and over and over. I never tire of CCR, and this is the absolute best CCR collection available!! If you enjoy classic rock, southern rock or any type of good rock then you'll love this. I may be biased though, because I grew up listening to this(I'm serious every member of my family has at least one copy of this cd)and I loved listening to it then and I sure do now! Fogerty was an excellent vocalist and a bit sly with the lyrics as well! Anyways I could gush over this album and band forever but if you like CCR at all or any rock then this should be in your collection!
B0000CAQ27|5.0|This is the first Pink album I bought, and it is awesome from start to finish.  This album rocks, plain and simple.  My favorite tracks are the current single, &quot;Trouble,&quot; &quot;God is a DJ,&quot; &quot;Last to Know,&quot; &quot;Tonight's the Night,&quot; &quot;Love Song,&quot; and it's really hard to pick between those.<br />The bonus DVD is pretty nice, too.  Has some really, really cool home videos from Pink (including her yelling at her dog), as well as waking up at 4 a.m. for a video shoot.<br />I highly recommend this album.
B0000CFW87|4.0|I became a Josh Groban fan after I saw his PBS concert special. His voice just takes my breath away. He has such a mature voice despite his young age. I wasted no time getting his second album. I have no regrets purchasing &quot;Closer&quot;. Often artists change their musical formula either too much or the other main complaint is lack of variety and not evolving enough musically. I think Josh's cd has an excellent balance between the two. His first album was sung mostly in italian and english. Closer has a variety of songs sung in italian, english, spanish, and french. Definitely a good move in a positive way because I can appreciate his voice in that many more languages. His voice is beautiful and he has a powerful range.  &quot;Remember when it rained&quot; is a very slow and tender ballad which is wonderful to listen to. I didn't know he wrote the lyrics until I saw it in the cd cover. It is one of my favorite songs. &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; is also a good song- very patriotic sounding. &quot;My Confession&quot; is also great- the texture and rhythms make it sound incredible. I enjoyed the opening track &quot;Oceano&quot;, Si Volvieras a Mi, All Improvisio Amore, and Mi Mancherai (with the beautiful violin accompaniment). Overall, I was very impressed with Josh's second album. Although I have absolutely no understanding of what he is saying in the foreign songs, he still sounds great. Get &quot;Closer&quot; to Josh and you won't be disappointed.
B000002H6C|5.0|&quot;...And Justice For All&quot; is, in my opinion, the best Metallica album ever.  Starting off with &quot;Blacked&quot;, a powerful song with rythmic guitar riffs, the album only gets better.  &quot;One&quot;, the closing song, is a classic, as metal songs go.  My personal favorite is the almost ten minute long &quot;...And Justice For All&quot;.  <br />Every song on the album is great, including a ten minute instrumental, &quot;To Live Is To Die&quot;.  If you haven't already bought this album, I strongly recomend that you do.  I don't, however, recommend any album after &quot;Metallica (the Black Album)&quot;.  If only Metallica had continued along the route of &quot;Justice&quot;....
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is one of the most enjoyable albums, from start to finish, ever. The Beatles really come into their own here, with Lennon/McCartney making room for the first Harrison composition on record with the group. <BR>     &quot;Taxman&quot; is a rocker that is an obvious nod to the band's roots. Penned by Harrison, it is about the seemingly heartless tax collector and is the first political statement by the Beatles. There is a nifty guitar solo too, done with the reverse tape technique. <BR>     &quot;Elanor Rigby&quot; is here in its beautiful simplicity. The string arrangements are just amazing. <BR>     &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; is a song about those days that you just want to stay in bed, and a personal favorite. Something about the harmonies and the simple acoustic guitar just appeals to me; a very moody song. <BR>     &quot;She Said, She Said&quot; is a fantastic Lennon peice about the dificulties in devoting oneself to a religion. Very deep lyrics and a very cool song. <BR>     &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot; is suprising in its awesome use of a horn section, and remains another solid song. <BR>     &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; is a peice done by George on the sitar and paints a vivid picture of the bands' jouney to the east in India. <BR>     &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; is here, notable for its experimentaion (and Ringo on vocals!), as is &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; which are both great songs. <BR>     There isn't a bad song in the bunch, quite frankly. The Beatles captured so many moods on this record. Eeach song is remakably crafted and unique, and proves the boys were ready to move from the hit-machine of the early 60s into the much more brilliant and fearlessly experimental chart toppers of the later decade. Revolver is a beautiful album that I will treasure &quot;Here, There and Everywhere.&quot;
B0000CAQ27|4.0|This is Pink's best album to date.<BR>Less R&amp;B and more pop/rock but in a cool way.<br />Worth checking out!
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is one of the most enjoyable albums, from start to finish, ever. The Beatles really come into their own here, with Lennon/McCartney making room for the first Harrison composition on record with the group. &quot;Taxman&quot; is a rocker that is an obvious nod to the band's roots. Penned by Harrison, it is about the seemingly heartless tax collector and is the first political statement by the Beatles.There is a nifty guitar solo too, done with the reverse tape technique. &quot;Elanor Rigby&quot; is here in its beautiful simplicity. The string arrangements are just amazing. &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; is a song about those days that you just want to stay in bed, and a personal favorite. Something about the harmonies and the simple acoustic guitar just appeals to me; a very moody song. &quot;She Said, She Said&quot; is a fantastic Lennon peice about the dificulties in devoting oneself to a religion. Very deep lyrics and a very cool song. &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot; is suprising in its awesome use of a horn section, and remains another solid song. &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; is a peice done by George on the sitar and paints a vivid picture of the bands' jouney to the east in India. &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; is here, notable for its experimentaion (and Ringo on vocals!), as is &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; which are both great songs.

B000001IPP|5.0|What more can be said about this album. Every song is a favorite. It's just one of those albums that has such an energy to it that you never want it to end, not unlike all of their albums. This definitely gets 5 stars, but I wouldn't even consider it one of their best 3 albums.

B0000085N4|5.0|In the summer of '88, a dozen of us went to see Metallica with special guests The Cult.  Although I only knew &quot;Fire Woman&quot;, I didn't hate them...but the croud did.  Middle fingers, obscenities, and pure venom was thrown at them.  And that's a shame, because I bought the album the following week to find out for myself why it was being praised to the skies in magazines, etc.<BR>  After one listen, I was hooked.  Powerful and memorable riffs, Zeppelinesque tunes like AUTOMATIC BLUES and SWEET SOUL ASYLUM (BLACK DOG and KASHMIR), and great production by Bob Rock makes this the group's masterpiece.  There's not one dog on this disc.  The album really smokes when after SWEET SOUL ASYLUM, Ian Asburry launches into NEW YORK CITY (a blistering verbal scathing on the Big Apple) &quot;...crashed the big apple...so I took a bite but she bit me back...&quot;  &quot;Hell's Kitchen is a DMZ/I ain't never coming back.&quot;  Next is the &quot;Black Dog&quot;-ish AUTOMATIC BLUES, and continues with the incredible SOLDIER BLUE that has a hook so powerful you'd have to be deaf not to tap your foot.  Oh sure, this album was eclipsed by the Metallica phenomenon and the God-awful hair bands that now make up most of the discount bins.  Yes, even lead singer Asburry was criticized for constant use of &quot;Lil' Honey,&quot; &quot;Sugar&quot; and &quot;Lil' Sista&quot; (DO any of these women have names?)  But those are pretty sorry criticisms for one of the best hard rock albums of the 80's.
B00004RJ74|5.0|Tarantino fans won't be disappointed. It's over-the-top, outrageous and hilarious.  It's also an opportunity to see Tarantino as an actor (in addition to writing the screenplay).  George Clooney and Harvey Kietel are great. Juliette Lewis is perfect. As with other Tarantino films, I was entertained from beginning to end. However, be forewarned that it's extremely violent.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|To start with my review I had to put things straight, You cannot compare any DT albums, and I really believe that´s a mistake a lot of guys are doing; if you love DT (as much as I do) you never have to compare any album, each of them are so complex and different than the other, and that´s the reason why we all like DT.<br />So you can say I&amp;A is the best album or Scenes is the best, or whatever, but if you realized what you are saying you´ll find you are not being honest with yourself; as for me I take each album as the best at the moment of their specific releases, and I really dig on every song and note, and I do this because I consider there´s no better album than the other on DT´s discography, it´s simply imposible to categorize them, all of them have something new (sound or lyrics or whatever) and that is why each of them are simply masterpieces. Simple if you want always the same then you are listening to the wrong band, don´t get me wrong I wish a more I&amp;W, Scenes or Awakes, but then where is the chill of finding something new on each album, if I wanted that I simply listen to those albums, but no I am always looking for something new, because I want to be amazed with every album DT takes out, and that is what I get with ToT, I mean I asked myself (man what are you listen to??) when I first listen James rapping or screaming the way he does on this album, but right now he turns those thoughts again into total respect, for one of the best vocalists I ´ve ever heard (as I have always believe), and that´s why I love DT they always do something different on every album, and you have to give them that.<br />ToT makes me think of leaving Prog music (just a few seconds) and turn into Metal but then I realized I was listenting to DT, and I won´t find that kind of power and feeling at the same time on any other band, so I just take this album as it really is a phenomenal album so different than I&amp;W or the concept of Scenes, and I LOVE IT...<br />But let me tell you, to truly understand ToT you have to put away all the ideas from the previous albums, they have nothing to do with eachother (but it always happens with DT -I recall Falling into infinity- as an example), and believe me you really going to dig this one too<br />So please take my humble opinion (or just send me f****n far away with it) and try to listen ToT as a whole different concept form DT, it is another offering form these five geniuses, and don´t try to compare this album with the previous ones, that cannot happen. Believe me either if you like metal or Prog (as myself) you will love this album, but you have to listen very well to it. By the way my personal favourites: Endless Sacrifice and This Dying Soul, but the whole album worths to be listened and it deserves 6 or 7 stars as the rest of the albums<br />Thanks Dream Theater for giving us the chance to listen to so different kind of things with every album, but always keeping your essence and honesty.....  you really rock   AGAIN...

B00008AY3L|5.0|this album is damn good despite the negative reviews.  it spans such a wide variety of genres.  you get reggae, blues, country, funk, hard rock, and folk.  i believe this album has two of ben's strongest tunes in amen omen and blessed to be a witness.  the lyrics to amen omen in the tradition of walk away and another lonely day perfectly capture the pain of lost love, plus its got a ben wail that will rip your heart out.  ben just knows how to capture real emotions is his music.  blessed to be a witness is one of ben's many spiritual tunes.  it speaks of living life to the fullest despite the greif and the pain.  the only low point on the album is when she believes.  this song is great lyrically, but is the victim of what happens all to often on ben albums, the symphonic touch cheeses the song instead of enhancing the emotion of the tune.  all though not as good as fight for your mind this album is much better than the crap on top 40 radio.  other key tracks: with my own two hands, when its good, diamonds on the inside, brown eyed blues, shes only happy in the sun.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I read all the reviews, and yes, its isnt vintage DT so if you want to hear vintage, throw in an old CD. This CD is well written, and of course, the musianship is vintage DT. Shows a  heavy side, not a &quot;dark&quot; as some have said, of the band. Bass lovers will apreciate Myungs best playing ever,  and JP, someone told me that the solos &quot;arent creative like old DT&quot; Must be a jealous guitarist, cuz Mr Petrucci rips every note, fast and clean. Actually I was surprised that the drums are a tad mellower then previous works ( if such a thing is possible). Mike plays with the band, not for them on this one. All in all, if you love DT, or metal music in general, buy this mofo. I promise you will keep in your CD player,car, or PC for weeks.
B000002UAR|5.0|I have not yet heard this album, but it says &quot;The Beatles&quot; on the back cover, so it must be a 5 star recording!
B000000OQF|5.0|With 1987's Appetite for Destruction the Guns &amp; Roses brought back to Metal what it always was supposed to have been.Rough edges,spiteful vocals,ever pounding drums and an attitude of sheer defiance towards the world.<br />Heaviosity in rock was back,decrowning the hair metal gods like Poison and bringing back the transgression present in Megadeth's and Metallica's early works.<br />They even managed to be radio friendly(Sweet Child O'Mine)at the same time that they wrote songs about heroin(Mr Brownstone) and prostitution(Welcome to the Jungle).<br />And they were global,sold millions and carried themselves with an unthinkable swagger.Above all they had their music to back their attitudes with each track of teir scorching debut ultimately achieving classic status and entering rock's mythology.
B000002UAO|2.0|To all the reviewers who give any album labeled &quot;The Beatles&quot; an automatic five stars, please get your facts straight.  The wonderful praise in the previous review directed to George Harrison for composing &quot;You Won't See Me&quot; should, in fact, be directed to Paul McCartney and John Lennon. This is symptomatic of the typical 5-star review.<br />As for Rubber Soul, George's &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; is very good, and possibly the best song on the album.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I've been a fan since &quot;Images and Words&quot; and must admit that even though this album seems to be getting grilled by a lot of people I truly like it a lot. It definitely is their darkest album and you can feel it through and through. I love the heaviness to it. It has anger behind it. I like all kinds of music from Bach to Cradle of Filth and Yanni (quit laughing) to Dimmu Borgir, but DT has remained my favorite band of all and this album makes me even more loyal to them. I say buy it!!
1573226521|4.0|I am not usually into &quot;traveling fiction&quot; but my sociology class required me to read a book relating to sociology, and fiction beats statistics any day. I got a brief summary from my teacher and I just didn't see why he liked it so much, but as soon as I started reading, it clicked! The one aspect that irked me was that I could never visualize a clear image of the characters and it side tracked me numerous times. Aside from that the book was amazing; it was a great movie you didn't want to stop watching. The book played out in a series of cinematic snapshots, which seemed so vivid and alive. Garland also reeled the reader in with his enticing exploration of human nature. Desire, greed, and adventure combined to make an enthralling piece of literature.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  It is different from her previous cd's, but her amazing voice makes every song wonderful.  I especially love &quot;Answer&quot;. The lyrics are so beautiful, and it seems to be a continuation of &quot;I love you.&quot;  This cd is great to relax to, and I often play it before I go to bed.  She is so talented and has such an incredible voice, this CD (although it could be longer) is one of the best and is my new favorite to listen to.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|No wait, you're not that good of an actress either.<br />Well, in any case, buyers beware.  This is over-processed garbage that's sucking the soul out of music, literally as I sit here and write. <br />There are much better singers and songwriters than the camera-loving J-Lo, you just have to search them out.  If you like this junk, your taste leaves much to be desired, sorry to say. <br />Thank you...I appreciate all amazon customers giving me the opportunity to say that.<br />BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000CDLA7|1.0|The question is when DT will hit the rock-bottom. I hope &quot;ToT&quot; is and that they will rise again. I think the fact that songwriting for this...took not more than 3 weeks says everything. And for the people who claim this to be their heaviest: PUH-LEEZ!!!
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|Will somebody please by Julian a microphone? After three days of being forced to listen to this by a Strokes nut at my job, I am ready to give these unimaginative 80's new wave thieves some decent equipment out of my own pocket. But then again, they'd probably spend more time trying to pose with it than figure out the proper use for it. Another band that makes the phrase &quot;Don't Believe The Hype&quot; relevant. At least you can HEAR what the White Stripes are singing. Dreadful and mundane, this.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I have several of the seinfeld episodes on video but cannot wait until a DVD of the enitre shows is made.<BR>Even if it is only for the USA markets I will buy it, and have some company in the copy it into an english format sometime.<BR>I would like nothing better than to sit down take a week off work and then watch every single one from start to finish.<BR>Please, Please release soon and if possible make it for the uk too, life is impossible since it went off air here.
B00005JKZV|4.0|Making a lord of the rings movie was never going to be easy. But if somone is good enough to pull it off it Peter Jackson. <BR>This movie is overwhelming. It takes you from the depths of the forest to the highest mountain top. <BR>You really cant imagine how they were able to make some of the scenes, such as the war scene, look so real. <BR>The good thing about this movie is that its not a hollywood flick. Its not Lord of the Rings starring Julia Roberts and Tom Cruise. The film tries to stay as true as they can to the story itself. Allthough a ew changes are neccesary becouse we dont have time to watch a 10 hour movie. <BR>In the end its a great visual ride through Middle Earth, with good visual effects and good acting. Enjoy it, but if you have read the book then dsont expect it to be exactly like the book.<BR>By the way it was great to see an iclandic singer do the theme song. Her name is Emilina Torreini and she allso wrote Kylie Minouges song Slow. Emilinas video to the theme song is on the dvd, Bjrk was offered to do the theme song first but she refused.
B0000A02TZ|3.0|I won't review the movie, if you haven't seen it by now or haven't heard how great it is then......!!???<BR>Anyway, the DSP edition is finally here, though the special edition wasn't too long ago!<BR> There's a few gripes here about the ads at the beginning of the movie. Yeah, it's pretty unforgivable in this day and age but you can zoom through them, though you shouldn't have to!<BR> The extras are a bit thin which is a shame because there must be lots more goodies from this movie out there somewhere.<BR> The reunion documentary is good but previously available on the SE dvd which many potential buyers will already have.<BR>Also the trailer here is a lot darker than the one on the SE version as well. Hmmm, not looking too good.<BR> The trivia pop ups are quite fun but not really breathtaking and I doubt you'll use this facility more than once.<BR> The 'Where Are They Now' mock-umentary is fun and the only real new extra on the disc. (The music promo is pretty worthless.)<BR>It's a shame this disc is another wasted opportunity extras wise. I do know that the original running time before edits was about 3 hrs so where's the footage?<BR>Martha Smith recently said that her end scene was edited down for the finished movie. She was originally involved in a catfight with Mary Louise Wellar over the character 'Greg' and that was when she got her dress torn off. Why weren't deleted scenes like this found for the dvd. Maybe in another 5 years we'll get to see another ten minutes of footage.<BR>Final verdict:- Great movie, so-so extras. Could do better.
B00005JMFO|4.0|I don't know how many other reviews I've read which all downgrade this film because of the \\"blatant nudity\\" in it. Yes, there is nudity and the nudity is related \\"distantly\\" to sex but those scenes are superfluous to the movie. What you're essentially seeing is the naked body, nothing to be ashamed of, right? Would the previous reviewers refuse to see Michelangelo's great works of art? Or so many other great masters who painted nudes? No one dares call those \\"pornographic.\\" It is so obvious that the two actors who portray naked stand-in actors are NOT naked to each other. If that's all you see, you've missed the point of the whole movie.<br />Politics between the USA and the UK? Forget it. The scene wasn't long enough to even draw attention to itself, except for those Yanks and Brits looking for a good fight anyway.<br />LOOK at the settings!  LISTEN to the script! WATCH the actors' faces! ABSORB the feelings emanating from the screen!<br />I only downgraded this movie to 4 stars rather than 5 because I personally didn't think there was enough of Colin Firth in it! I loved this movie and will buy a copy as soon as it is available.  Recommend you look at the movie from perhaps a different angle, and do the same.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Still the quintessential grand daddy of most of today's sci-fi features, Forbidden Planet has it all!<br />The DVD quality is great although I would have liked a few of the other 187 languages and sub-tongues Robby alludes to offered on the disk besides colloquial English and French.<br />However if you look at a classic Sci-Fi T.V series like the original Star Trek you can see where Jean Roddenberry might have gotten some of his inspiration.<br />The Earth cruiser is a disk, used Hyper Drive (Warp Drive), has a chief engineer that wears a suspiciously similar earpiece to the one Spock wore to listen to radio transmissions. The captain has an executive officer, and a doctor on board ala number one and Dr. McCoy, the list of similarities with Trek goes on and on.<br />My suggestion is to watch the wide screen version, on the opposite side of the disk, turn off the lights and watch it on a large screen if you can. It is well worth it!<br />The actors are great; Walter Pidgeon offers a great performance as Dr. Morbius. Anne Francis and Leslie Nielsen are great together and the Cinemascope does the rest.<br />This one's a must for the collection.
B00008G9JM|5.0|Wow, why did I wait so long for this one.  Having most of the bands albums and cds in the 70's and the last remasters, somehow I skipped this one and passed it off. Well, without a doubt, the most progressive intense, emotional Jethro Tull album ever.  I really enjoy Thick as a Brick but this one is just amazing, it has acoustic parts off and on, electric parts and flute spectacular!!!!!   I really can't describe this in a good manner, just get it!!!!!  For history's sake, the original Passion Play tapes were not considered good by the band, so they left France(i believe) and back to England and re-recorded it with all new parts.  The original tapes of APP can be heard on the first cd of the Nightcap cd and that is another review!!!   If you have passed on this one for some strange reason like I did, get it and get the new remaster, fantastic sounding!!!!  Again, the most progressive and intense Jethro Tull album, I even like the 5 minute story, The Hare who lost his Spectacles!!!<br />Amazing!!!!!!!
0385504209|4.0|First the good news.  Brown should recieve an award for &quot;strategic writing.&quot;  This book has all the elements of the best seller it has become.  The chapters are short, each ending with a tantalizing foreshadow of what incredible event lies just beyond the next page.  The story is faced paced, uninhibited by lengthy character or setting development.  The events are just to the other side of incredible.  You won't be able to put this book down.<br />Now the bad news.  This book could not be footnoted, Brown takes enormous license with historical facts.  He takes as fact all the claims by the marginal political groups with personal agendas, while dismissing as false any respected scholar as being in bed with &quot;the church.&quot;  The last time I checked there was a heated debate going on between &quot;the church&quot; and respected New Testament academics, prehaps Brown missed Reimarius, Schweitzer, Funk.  Also absent is an understanding that no women in her right mind would vote in the Gnostics over the cannon gospels.  Perhaps Elaine Pagels being the only exception, a woman who, in the words of the Gospel of Thomas, wants to become a man so that she will be allowed entry into the Kingdom of God.<br />But lets not ruin good fiction by demanding that it should not be.  The reader is evidently meant to take the author's note in the beginning of the book as fiction when he states, &quot;All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.&quot;  They are anything but accurate.<br />The book is entertaining and will cause a dialog about the nature of Jesus, for that it should be praised.  But it should not be taken as accurate evidence, when it is no more than one author's wishful construction of history to fit his current needs.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Before you play this album for the first time, you will inevitably ask yourself one question: &quot;Has all the hype and b.s. of the past two years gone to the Strokes' heads?&quot; Even after the first listen, the answer should be a firm &quot;no.&quot; This is a band that, despite having enough praise heaped upon them to logically have their heads in the clouds, have kept their feet firmly planted on the ground. Their are subtle differences in this second record in comparison to the first, such as a thicker production, but in general, the rules of a great Strokes song still apply. These two to three-minute songs are short but sweet, with not a wasted note or second. Some might complain that this amounts to an album that is too short, to which I say &quot;quality not quantity.&quot; In my opinion, just about every second of this disc is great, and I respect albums that don't wear out their welcome instead of trying to come up with a percentage of filler. Plus, once again, the great melodies of this band cannot be denied, however they try to dress it up with their brand of stripped-down rock. Unlike most bands today, the Strokes seem sure of what they're doing without being too self-conscious, which is a pretty difficult balance to pull off. If they don't question themselves, most others won't either, which can only lead to more great albums in the future. I have the patience to wait another two years; records this addictive and inspired are more than worth the wait.
B00000255F|5.0|This album was written the year I was born.  My brothers and sisters would play this again and again for me at a young age.  Now, later in life I have returned to this great album.  And it brings back many great memories.  Anybody who wants to get their first Spingsteen album; this is the one!
B000003S09|1.0|This pretentious shlock is hilariously bad.  It may be awful, but at least its good for some hearty laughs.  If you like this stuff, listen to &quot;Stonehenge&quot; by Spinal Tap.  The only difference is that Tap is TRYING to be funny.  Drug use is the only excuse for this tripe-oozing swill.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|It is very seldome that I enjoy a CD from cover to cover, but I love every song on this album.  Sarah's incredible voice and songwriting tallent is really showcased in every song.  Very strong work.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B000069AUI|5.0|When I played this album, my fetus killed himself. It wasn't pretty. Please don't waste your money on this album. The lead singer bones Gwyneth Paltrow, for gods sakes.
B0000A4GAK|3.0|This CD is marginal. It begins with Soul Serenade, based on the version performed by the Allman Brothers thirty years before (available on the 4 disc box set). Derek rips into it after only a minute long buildup.  The problem is, the album peaks there, at two minutes in. That's not to say that completely crashes after that, it's kind of like going to DisneyWorld and riding Space Mountain first.    The other highlight is a bluesy rock number entitled \\"Drown in my own Tears\\" featuring Gregg Allman. This easily sounds like it could have been on the Allman's 2003 incredible release, Hittin' the Hote.    However, my recommendation is to check out that CD, then Joyful Noise, and then this one.    One last interesting note is that these tracks were actually recorded before the band's last CD: Joyful Noise. Also, Gregg's vocal part was recorded on a seperate date from Derek's guitar leads, but they still manage to work well together.
B0000E1WNV|5.0|The most compelling, awesome, steaming, hot rocking piece of live music captured on DVD! This is fabulous stuff. Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band is in topform. The music is righteous. Great setlist. So many highlights - all The Rising songs(!), Promised Land, Spirit In The Night, Ramrod, Born To Run, Born In The USA. This concert is also great because of the passionate Spanish audience. When I saw the first part of the concert on MTV last year, it made me decide to go the Barcelona concert in may this year. The best audience I've seen so far (I saw Springsteen since the River tour in 1981 in so many places!). Thank you Bruce, thank you E Street Band and thank you Barcelona!
B000002H97|2.0|I can't believe how many people are saying &quot;I hated heavy metal until I heard this...&quot;<BR>Well, sorry to disappoint you, but you still hate heavy metal, because this ain't it! <BR>As a fan of TRUE METAL, it scares me to hear fans of pop music say that this got them into metal. It just goes to show that, with this album, Metallica became acceptable within the mainstream culture. To do that, you have to consciously write songs that are catchy to the undiscriminating ear, much like dance music. <br />When you also enjoy Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets, THEN and only then will you enjoy heavy metal. Liking this does NOT make you a metal fan, because it does not meet the musical requirements of that genre, as exemplified by the aforementioned RtL and MoP. There is no comparison. This is hit radio music, not metal.<BR>The only metallic thing about this is the guitar tone. Unfortunately, its application is utilized in 3-chord radio tripe that can only appeal to those with no cognizance of Metallica's history pre-1990. <BR>That's fine. You fans of Creed, Andrew WK, Limp Bizkit, etc. can continue to think you're into metal, while those of us who were there in the beginning will just snicker, jeer, and point at you while cranking &quot;Creeping Death&quot;.<BR>What's &quot;Creeping Death&quot;, you ask? sheesh....go do your homework, kid.
6305499365|5.0|This movie impressed me more than I thought it would.  It's hard to find a good comedy these days.  Well folks, this is it.  It'll have you laughing out loud every single second (unless you're some management jerk..)<br />So already you have a great comedy about how pointless, boring and horrible many jobs are these days.  But beneath the comedy, there's an entire satire of modern life, and that's what makes me call this movie &quot;genius.&quot;  While it is a comedy (no tear-jerking scenes or anything like that), I found myself saying over and over &quot;That's exactly like real life!!!!&quot;  which is why it's a genius film that every Gen X'er or younger should watch!<br />Watch, and laugh at the absurdity which surrounds you.
B000002H33|5.0|Now, this is what I've been talking about! I'd love to see the looks on the faces of those who actually like Metallica's last 3 or 4 albums when they hear this for the first time! THIS IS METALLICA! Not Load, not St. Anger, not even the black album. THIS is how most of us want to remember the Metallica-that-was. <BR>Epic songs, meaningful lyrics, complex song arrangements...it's all here in this most metallic of metal classics, along with its counterpart Ride The Lightning. Proof positive that Cliff Burton was the metallic soul and messenger of the band, and that without him they became like a ship in a storm without a compass or captain.<BR>Read the editorial review and notice how it refers to Metallica as &quot;thrash&quot;. Almost seems ludicrous compared to their 90s music, but it is perfect as a description for MoP. Metallica WAS a thrash band. Then they lost it. No, they didn't &quot;lose&quot; it, they willingly gave it up for the sake of greed. If they hadn't sold out, they'd still be making this greatest of all musical art forms.<BR>Some say: &quot;Why should they have kept putting out the same album all the time?&quot;<BR>I reply: Because it's what they excel at! Lightning is very similar to Puppets, but no one says they sound the same. It's the STYLE that's similar, and it's what they should have stayed with to maintain their credibility. They willingly went pop just to spit on everyone who helped them get recognition to begin with, and for that they deserve nothing.
B00005JMFR|1.0|Unbelievably bad. Atrocious. It's a long time since I've been this disappointed after seeing a fim on the big screen. Part of the problem is the build-up and the hype, coupled with the fact that Matrix 1 is utterly fantastic. <br />If you go to see this for the special effects, you will not be satifsfied. They are good, but there is nothing ground-breaking or jaw-droppingly good.<br />If you go to see it for a plot or good acting, then prepare to blub into your popcorn. The plot is weak, meandering and falls into the pit of repeating cliche. The fight scenes are way too long, and the most tedious I have ever seen - there is no suspense or climactic development to the plot. Acting is at best workaday, and at times the worst kind of hamming. Hugo Weaving's laugh towards the end comes straight out of the pantomine top-drawer.<br />If you go to see it for a conclusion to the series - don't bother. Some of the reviews seem to suggest that it leaves you thinking - the only thinking I was doing as I came out of the cinema was 'why have I wasted £8 and 2.5 hours of my life on this...' There are more holes in the plot than in swiss cheese - but the point is you can't be bothered with working out why - you are not drawn into the characters  or situations.<br />I could go on, but I can't be bothered to expend any more effort on this - precisely the attitude that the filmmakers seem to have adopted.
B000002HMH|1.0|The same old story: those who jumped onto the Metallica bandwagon with the &quot;Black Album&quot; think this rocks, while those of us who were there from the beginning see this as the insult that it is.<BR>I guess all of the true metalheads need to come to terms with the fact that this band is pitching for the bubble gum team now, playing Awards shows next to Britney Spears.<BR>This album is not just an embarrassment to Metallica, it's an embarrassment to METAL and it's fans, because all of the pop-tarts that bought into this think that this is really METAL. And now they count themselves among those of us who truly understand what a joke this is.<BR>The only people who will rate this very high are the weekend metalheads who prefer music like Creed, 3 Doors Down, or maybe even Christina Aguilera, because the pop sensibilities and catchy music so prevalent on those albums are found here. That is who can appreciate this simplistic, braindead music. To real metalheads with an understanding of complex, cerebral music, and the intelligence to comprehend it, this is worth less than a barf bag.
B00008J4P5|1.0|So I've heard that this is the greatest record of the year...heck of all time.  Well I can tell you, as Chuck D wisely said: don't believe the hype.  That's right...I'm one of about five people in this world who haven't jumped on the White Stripes bandwagon.  Heck, even Rolling Stone gave it five stars.  That must mean it's as good as Bob Dylan's \\"Love And Theft\\" which got five stars, and \\"Elephant\\" is no \\"Love And Theft.\\"  Where do you get the idea that this is a great album.  It's just a guy with his ... National guitar (Jack White even said buying a Les Paul would feel like cheating) and Sears Silvertone amp and a girl with a junk drum set.  C'mon folks, they don't even have a bassist.  The music sounds empty and flat without any sort of medium between the guitar and drums.  Also, the lyrics lack any quality whatsoever, just because they may be random and weird, doesn't mean they're great.  I have read reviews that say Jack White \\"wails\\" on the guitar and Meg \\"pounds the drums to kingdom come\\" (or something like that).  Well I can tell you that, no Jack White does not \\"wail\\".  Until he can play solos like Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, Clapton, Robby Krieger, George Harrison, Keith Richards, David Gilmour, etc. I'm not convinced that he can \\"wail\\".  Also, Meg's drumming is terrible.  She's playing on what, a three piece drum set?  She's purely a backbeat drummer, she's no John Bonham, Mitch Mitchell, Keith Moon, Neil Peart, Bill Bruford, etc.  Overall, their \\"minimalist\\" gimmick hasn't fooled me...it's a shame that all of you who have bought any of their albums have been fooled by their \\"minimalism.\\"    Led Zeppelin II came out in 1969, over 30 years later we're still hailing it as one of the greatest of all time.  Tell me, in 2033, will people talk about \\"Elephant\\" being one of the greatest albums of all time?  Don't think so.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Codes is quite simply put, a page turner. Not only does it show Dan Browns talent as a masterful story teller, but the entire book is intricately laced with fine research and astounding facts. Even if you aren't the type to enjoy intellectual pieces such as this, the story is still enthralling and may just open your eyes. After reading this, I began delving deeper into the theory of Mary Magdalene and the holy grail. I was never a history buff but this is just too good. I highly recommend it.
B000002KYR|4.0|Some people like slick, some like gritty. Some like their music to have a polished studio sound, others an organic natural grunge. I happen to like both and this ZZ Top title satisfies my ears and mind just right ! Hardcore ZZ Top fans have bashed this album for its early MTV pop appeal and others who grew up glued to MTV love it. I am in neither category but am able to appreciate and enjoy Eliminator just the same after all these years. Yes, it's electronically slick. Yet, that ZZ Top trademark sound of blues/rock is unmistakeable and easily identifiable despite the &quot;studio-electricity&quot; flowing through it (yes, I have heard some of their earlier works as well). Eliminator had it's own unique individual and distinctive electric guitar and bass, drum driven sound that no other pop-rock bands or new wave groups of the time possessed or dared to even come close to !
B0000DC13U|3.0|Judging a DVD by its cover and title, you'd think that this film is a documentary following the construction of one of the Rolling Stones most famous songs &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; (hence the title).  However, alternating with footage from the stones recording this song in the studio, is some skits of some sort, something i wasn't so interested in seeing, because i mainly bought the dvd to see the stones and only the stones... i didn't have the patience to sit through some random skits.  I'm sure these skits did have a deeper meaning, pose some importance, but for rolling stones fans, all we care about is the rock and roll, and the five (well, now four) guys behind it.  I would've originally given this a 2 star, but the footage of the stones in the studio is so great, that it earned a star in itself.  So, if you are one of these, i would say save your money for the Four Flicks dvd (just ordered, can't wait, but if you know the director and like his style, then yes, this would probably be a fit purchase.
0345357116|4.0|The information around the Istari, Galadriel and Celeborn, and Eorl are particularly interesting.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Another excellent masterpiece from Pearl Jam, although flawed.<br />I have three complaints about it, let me get those out of the way first:<br />1. My favorite B-side, &quot;Alone&quot;, for some reason was re-recorded for this album. The original - which can be found on the &quot;Go&quot; single. sounds much better, Eddie's singing is stronger and even a few words were different.<br />2. Why isn't &quot;Angel&quot; or &quot;Daddy Could Swear, I Declare&quot; on here?<br />3. And my favorite rarity, &quot;Brother&quot;, for some reason has no vocals. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ALL ABOUT??? The guitar is still amazing and rocking as hell and this is still PJ's hardest song, but without the vocals, it feels very lacking.<br />Other than that, _Lost Dogs_ is an excellent work of art.<br />Disc One:<BR>1. All Night - One of the MANY _No Code_ rejects on here. Fun song. **** (out of 5)<BR>2. Sad - Originally titled &quot;Letter To The Dead&quot;. I have no idea why it was renamed. Has always been my favorite _Binaural_ outtake. Incredible opening riff. *****<BR>3. Down - An upbeat litle number from the _Riot Act_ sessions. A huge fan favorite. ***<BR>4. Hitchhiker - Catchy little song from the _Binaural_ sessions. ***<BR>5. Don't Gimme No Lip - Very fun and catchy rock song from Stone. Sounds sort of like &quot;Mankind&quot;s sister song. Fun! ****<BR>6. Alone - As I said before, my favorite PJ B-side. Amazing. *****<BR>7. In The Moonlight - Cool blues number. ****<BR>8. Education - The 2nd of the coveted _Binaural_ outtakes. Love it. *****<BR>9. Black, Red, Yellow - Oh yeah, we always knew Pearl Jam would release a song about Dennis Rodman. And here it is. The most fun song PJ has ever released next to &quot;Mankind&quot;. Gotsta love it. ****<BR>10.U - Cute little _Yield_ B-side. Simple and catchy. ***<BR>11.Leavin' Here - Infectious, baby! Love this song, although it's sounds much better live. *****<BR>12.Gremmie Out Of Control - If The Beach Boys had a singer with a lowvoice. Crazy tune! Very '60s. ***<BR>13.Whale Song - I've always loved this song. The Jack Irons vocals kick major ass. Powerful, memorable, and fun. *****<BR>14.Undone - Great _Riot Act_ B-side. If it made it on the album, it would have been one of the best on it. *****<BR>15.Hold On - A B-side from, in my opinion, PJ's best album (_Vs._), this song, surprisingly, isn't quite all I expected. Still good though. ***<BR>16.Yellow Ledbetter - This song hardly needs introduction. Absolutely beautiful. PJ often uses it to close concerts, in fact the PJ concert I went to was closed with this song. Absolutely beautiful. One of the greatest songs of all time. *****<br />Disc 2:<BR>1. Fatal - The 3rd _Binaural_ outtake and considered the best among most fans. Excellent. *****<BR>2. Other Side - Jeff's _Riot Act_ B-side from the &quot;Save You&quot; single. Good song. ***<BR>3. Hard To Imagine - Another _Vs._ B-side. A very popular fan favorite. Heavily requested at concerts. ****<BR>4. Footsteps - Another very big fan favorite. ***<BR>5. Wash - An absolutely incredible, sweeping _Ten_ B-side. Probably one of PJ's top 30 songs in my opinion. *****<BR>6. Dead Man - Originally recorded for the &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; soundtrack. Those ungreatful bastards didn't even put it on the soundtrack! Oh well, it's still a great and very powerful song. ****<BR>7. Strangest Tribe - Pretty good calm song from the 1999 Christmas single. ****<BR>8. Drifting - Very nice and peaceful. ***<BR>9. Let Me Sleep - Cool, interesting Christmas song. Neat little jungle bongo sound. ***<BR>10.Last Kiss - Supposedly PJ's biggest radio &quot;hit&quot;. Not bad, although overrated. **<BR>11.Sweet Lew - Well...um...wow. Jeff does the vocals on this song. Weird as hell. It's sort of a rap song. Interesting. **<BR>12.Dirty Frank - The hilarious _Ten_ B-side about how PJ thought their bus driver was a serial killer. I love it! Eddie makes a funny comment in the booklet - &quot;Rob Zombie should make a movie based on these lyrics.&quot; That'd be somethin' alright. ****<BR>13.Brother - With vocals, this song is absolutely amazing, without them, it's still awesome, but nowhere near as good. ****<BR>14.Bee Girl - Very nice little acoustic number by Eddie and Jeff. Good song to fall asleep to. ****<br />Well, if that's not enough to make you want to buy the album (god forbid!) the CD booklet is also awesome. Definetly pick this one up.
0312263120|4.0|Few thrillers dare to tread on the turf of the NSA, preferring the comfortable terrain of the FBI or CIA.  As portrayed by Brown, the NSA relies upon stealth, brainpower and technological wizardry to monitor the world's voice and data communications.  The plot revolves around a brilliant, ex-NSA scientist, Tankado.  Worried about the government's ability to monitor all communications, he has threatened the release of a totally new cryptographic technology, termed &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;.<br />Digital Fortress is impervious to traditional &quot;brute force&quot; attacks and, thus, the NSA's highly parallel supercomputers.  The only chance to contain this groundbreaking technology lies with Susan Fletcher, head cryptographer, and her fiance, David Becker, who has been sent to Spain to retrieve Digital Fortress' only key.<br />Ignoring the book's technological explanations (many of the cryptographic and other details are flat-out wrong), the plot is pretty exciting.  Few novels deal with the NSA with all of the requisite, technically daunting explanations... but Brown has rendered a pretty exciting story around the NSA, even if many of the background details are off-base.
0792151712|4.0|This movie starts in a present day time. Treasure hunter Brock Levitt and his crew are searching the &quot;Titanic&quot; for a lost 56 carat diamond named the &quot;Heart of the Ocean&quot;. He hopefully examines the contents of a safe, but only finds a drawing of a nude wearing the diamond. The drawing is televised and recognized by Rose DeWitt Bukater(Kate Winslet). She contacts Brock and meets with him on his boat. She tell the story of the diamond and how she is the woman in the nude drawing. Her story begins 84 years ago when she is a seventeen year old socialite traveling with her mother and snobbish fiance, Cal Hockley(Billy Zane) from Liverpool to New York where their wedding is to take place. <BR>   2,200 passengers are aboard the Titanic, called &quot;The Ship of Dreams&quot;, among them penniless artist, Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio)who wins his ticket and boards the luxury liner at the last minute. There he notices Rose and an intense love affair begins that will last almost a century with some aid from Molly Brown(Kathy Bates) who is also a passenger. <BR>   Rose is now 101 years old but her memory is sharp as she tells this epic love story of that fateful night so long ago.<BR>This is a long movie,194 minutes long but it will keep most viewers from pre-teen to the elderly riveted to their seats, as any thriller will do, anxiously awaiting the next scene.<BR>   I rate this movie 4 stars out of 5.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|Some really bright spots, although you can see why some of the tracks didn't make it on other albums.
B000089RVX|4.0|I detest reviewers who base their knowledge of a band strictly on what the radio plays.  &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; fits what it was designed to fit, it brought Wind-Up Records the fame for two of its artists, and breathed life into the movie &quot;Daredevil.&quot;  It was something that fit an empty niche on the radio, and was subsequently all that played in that niche.<br />The rest of the album, however, is much more artful and incredible.  Epic in scope and premise, and it fits Amy's image perfectly (seductive but foreboding).  By now &quot;Going Under&quot; has been no doubt their second single, and perhaps it will change your opinion slightly, but it doesn't defer away from the common radio-rock enough to be my final example.  Songs &quot;Tourniquet&quot;, &quot;Taking Over Me&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot;, &quot;Imaginary&quot;, and &quot;My Last Breath&quot; are dark and complex.<br />I do agree, they do have room to grow, but I don't think they're going to be stuck in the niche their first big single put them into for long.
B000089RVR|4.0|Honestly no one's review that I read gave a reason why this cd was bad or good. Now if you noticed I gave it a 4 star rating, because compared to her last albulm there is some more emotional depth in this one than last. Instrumental-wise it might not be very strong, but notice this coming out of Arista Records, so its not as much instrumental focus. Now for 1-star, I'm not attacking anybody, but for heaven sake. I would hope this guy at least gives 85% of the other music we hear today worse than that. Seriously I'm not a dido fan, but I bought this CD. And even thats going out of my genre spectrum(Jazz,heavy metal,R&amp;B, and Rap). I agree that i might be generous with 4 stars but come on look at a singer like Clay Aiken (notice I did not use artist) out there. Your telling me this is worse than that garbage.
B000003TAL|5.0|Most people will look at this album as the beginning of grunge, celebrate it as a relic, and then leave it for dead at the side of the road for Nirvana. To be honest with you, what does Kurt Cobain have that Thurston Moore and company don't, aside from suicidal tendencies? Think about that and then buy this landmark album. Enjoy.<br />The album starts off calmly enough with clear, focused guitars and Kim Gordon's soft voice spiralling around in the noise. Then the song stops for a moment and then unleashes a guitar barrage from Moore and Lee Ranaldo before cutting into the main part of the classic 'Teen Age Riot.' This song basically defines what this album is all about in a clean six and a half minutes. (By the way, if you're a person who can't handle six and a half minute songs, look for another album; four songs on this album fall into the seven-minute category, unless you want to count 'Trilogy' as one song, bringing it to a tidy thirteen and a half minutes or thereabouts.) If this song doesn't settle you in for the album, the rest sure won't suit your tastes, as can be observed in 'Silver Rocket.' This song is harder than 'Riot,' with meaner guitars and the section of pure distortion in the middle. This is followed by the aptly-titled 'The Sprawl,' the longest song on the album. This album is a good relaxor after the assault of 'Rocket,' even with lyrics like, \\"Does this sound simple, Fu*k you, Are you for sale, Does 'Fu*k you' sound simple enough, this was the only part that turned me on.\\" 'Cross the Breeze' starts off as a softer, gentler song, a possible foil for the artsy blare of the previous and later tracks, until it comes in with the pounding metal-ish drums and accompanying guitars. 'Eric's Trip' seems to be imitating a drug-induced stupor, with its wobbly noises and too-good-to-be-true lyrics. 'Total Trash' is a successor in sound to 'Riot' with its catchy guitar riffs and bass line. 'Hey Joni' is possibly the album's finest song, full of meandering lyrics and great guitar experimenting. 'Providence' resembles this in my mind: a lounge piano act playing during an earthquake with a loudspeaker's voice calling out over the playing. Listen to it to understand. 'Candle' is another song that fits well with 'Riot' and gives its name to the iconic cover art. 'Rain King' is another very hard song with blazing guitars and bass over the thundering drums. 'Kissability' is a very good garage rock riff with Gordon's lyrics. Lastly comes 'Trilogy,' the three-song epic of amazing'The Wonder,' physchedelic 'Hyperstation,' and the sexually charged metal anthem 'Eliminator Jr.'<br />Why would you skip over this album for Nirvana? I'm not saying Nirvana and Kurt Cobain are not the greatness that the hype plays them up to be. Nevermind is a classic album, but, then again, so is Daydream Nation. Get both and enjoy them both. But whatever you do, don't overlook either album for the masterpieces that they are.
0698119347|5.0|this was definatly a great book. i loved every page because each one brought a new surprise! i recomend this book to everyone.
B000001GF9|5.0|This is a wonderful recording of the c-minor mass... My only complaint is that Bernstein blitzed the qui-tollis from the Gloria. It is surprising to me that he would have done this after having conducted the Lacrimosa from the Requiem with an extremely slow and justified tempo. I don't believe that Bernstein put as much time and attention into this work as he did with the Mozart Requiem, however it is still a wonderful recording; one of the Bernstein's final recordings. The Ave Verum Corpus is stunning! I can't say that I agree with the other reviewers that felt this recording was inferior to other recordings of the c-minor mass. The quality is exceptional.
B000002A3T|4.0|Facts:  This album is (as of 11/17/03) the last album released by Pink Floyd that can be said to contain substantial new material.  This contains the songs &quot;Take it Back&quot; and &quot;High Hopes&quot;.  This features Pink Floyd's only Grammy winning piece--&quot;Marooned&quot;.  Roger Waters is not credited with any lyrics, nor does he perform with the band.<br />Opinions:  There is a theme in The Division Bell.  And the Publius Enigma mystery (redundant?) is proof of that.  Do a search on any search engine with the words &quot;Publius Enigma&quot; and you'll see.  And whether it was just a marketing gimmick will always be up for debate.<br />But the album.  The lyrics are probably the deepest that David Gilmour has ever gotten.  With a little help from his wife on most of the songs, he explores themes that the listener can only assume to be associated with Roger Waters, Syd Barrett, Humanity's humanity, environment, hopes, dreams, self-reflection, silence, isolation, and the hub of it all, COMMUNICATION.<br />If lyrics were tossed to the side, the tunes themselves are incredibly soothing to listen to.  This is not the scathing Pink Floyd of Roger Waters that had built up The Wall or the &quot;whatever the hell that was&quot; that was A Momentary Lapse in Reason.  This is Pink Floyd that can be considered &quot;easy listening&quot;.  This album is for those who may simply want to enjoy good tunes.  This album is for those who also know something of the band's history and would like to dig deeper and find significance in every lyric.  This album is for those who enjoy David Gilmour's guitar and voice.  This album can easily be enjoyed if you have missed Richard Wright's piano keys as he seemed to be missing in action from Pink Floyd's catalog for approx. 10 years.  This album features his vocals on one track that appropriately splits this album into halves.<br />So I lend my words for the reader's benefit in hopes that he or she looks into this album and enjoys exploring what's inside.  Just don't be expecting progressive tunes like those found on Animals or the dark, murkiness of The Wall.  Don't be expecting the mish/mash that was A Momentary Lapse in Reason.  I may be in error here in the eyes of many, but come to this album expecting something closer to the days of creativity that went into Dark Side of the Moon.
B00005JMFR|5.0|This film was great. It was awfully underrated and constantly criticised for it's 'bad acting'. Sure, it had a couple errors and cliches. But doesn't every movie? The questions left 'un-answered' are unknown to me. Apparently, some don't remember what the first movie was about. Basically, stopping Smith and stopping the machines. Which they did, so how exactly was it left open?Some say the lines were 'cheesy'.  But how does one define 'cheesy'. Without taking lines from other movies as an example.Some came in expecting way to much of this movie. To be better than the first one. Which wasn't going to happen. The first was ground-breaking. But it's hard to be as ground-breaking as an original and live up to the expectations of an audience. All in all, I don't see why everyone believes this is such a bad movie. The action was great, the storyline kept faithull, and it had a good ending. Some say, Reloaded had a 'crappy story'. Well,hmm, the storyline doesn't change through a trilogy. It stayed the same, so how can it be crappy without the storyline all in all being bad?Doesn't make much sense to me. This film is a must see. It's a great finale to a GREAT trilogy.
B000002C1W|3.0|Fact: This album contains the songs &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; and &quot;On the Turning Away&quot;.  It was released in 1987 without bassist Roger Waters having any writing credits or performing credits in the band.<br />Opinion: This album doesn't sound like Pink Floyd.  If the listener is expecting the sound to be similar to Dark Side... or Wish You Were Here or The Wall or The Final Cut or, well just about anything else Pink Floyd has ever done.  If you like David Gilmour's voice, you may like this album because you haven't probably heard him this much since his solo albums or prior to Animals.  If you like his guitar, you very well may like this album because David Gilmour plays his guitar well and plays it a lot.  If you like the lyrics of Roger Waters (such as Dark Side... or Animals or The Wall), you will most likely first vomit all over this album, then clean it off, and reluctantly add it to your now complete Pink Floyd catalog, never to be played again.  If you like creative Nick Mason's drumming, then you are realizing his creative drumming has been resting in peace since it was pronounced dead during the making Wish You Were Here.  We are all still mourning.  If you like Richard Wright's keyboards, then you get to see him on the inside flap of the CD cover.  His keyboards are just replaced with synthesizers that do not require his abilities.<br />This album DOES contain the two songs mentioned above though.  But it also contains wasted space of noise such as A New Machine (parts 1 &amp; 2).  This album is enjoyable to sit and listen to.  Not as good as the 1970s Pink Floyd though.  If the lyrics of Roger Waters are too heavy for you or you just don't like his voice, this album may be for you.  <br />Please don't get the impression that this is the same Pink Floyd as The Division Bell though.  Or the same as anything from the Roger Waters dominated years.  It's just what its title suggests it is.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle's &quot;Thriteenth Step&quot; is a great CD. It was worth every cent I payed for it! The CD starts out with the 7+ minute amazing song &quot;The Package&quot; and contiunes with great songs such as &quot;The Noose&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot; and ends with the amazing song &quot;Gravity&quot;. All of the songs on the CD are awesome. This CD is just mind blowing and get's better with every listen! A Perfect Circle has now gotten themselfs a big fan!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|\\"This is the start of something good, don't you agree?\\" croons 26-year-old Gavin Degraw at the start of \\"Follow Through\\", the opening track of his debut album, CHARIOT, which has thus far peaked at #8 on Billboard's Heatseeker chart.  While a modest success saleswise as of yet, a thorough listen to the album proves the undeniable fact that this artist and album are destined for bigger, better places.<br />Degraw has been at this for quite some time, despite having recently released his debut album.  A native of Manhattan, he has been an integral part of New York's music scene for a while now.  His music being unique yet comfortably familiar, hometown fans have come in droves to see his local shows.<br />His individuality shines throughout CHARIOT.  While at first glance one might think they could lump him with other successful male singer/songwriters of lately who shouldn't even be being generalized in the first place such as Jason Mraz, John Mayer, Jack Johnson and, most recently, Josh Kelley, Degraw separates himself immediately from them with his smorgasbord of veering song structures, uniquely quirky lyrics and signature voice.  It also helps that his album isn't produced by John Alagia and that his name does not begin with J.<br />In the oddball \\"Chemical Party\\" he gives you a bird's eye view of what it is to be \\"too high to see the point\\", while the lead single \\"Follow Through\\" is a catchy tale of mutual sincerity in what could be the start of a rewarding relationship. \\"I Don't Have to Be\\", the set's easy highlight, is an ode to individuality.<br />\\"All I have to do/Is think of me and I have peace in mind/I'm tired of lookin' round rooms/Wondering what I've got to do/Or who I'm supposed to be/I don't want to be anything other than me.\\"<br />One song with particular hit potential is the endearing \\"(Nice To Meet You) Anyway\\", which could be considered an optimistic follow-up to the situation presented earlier in \\"Follow Through\\", which did not work out in the scheme of things, resulting in his finding a more nurturing, special relationship.  Also, in \\"Over-Rated\\", the uplifting finish to CHARIOT, Gavin tells his companion that, because of her, he now sees the stuff of life to be materialistic and, as it turns out, not so important.<br />Other definite highlights include \\"Belief\\", a stream-of-conscious tune that features Degraw's soaring vocals at its conclusion, and the album's title track, which is delightful to the ears and cannot help but bring a smile or even perhaps a chuckle to the listener.<br />\\"Your favorite fruit is chocolate-covered cherries/And seedless watermelon/Nothing from the ground is good enough/Body Rise/Look what's over me/Oh chariot/Your golden waves/Are walking down/Upon this face/Oh chariot/I'm singing out loud\\".<br />Hopefully Gavin will break into mainstream success similar to Jason Mraz, who did so quite a while after his debut album was released.  With an excellent album, a strong local fan base and constant self-promotion, all the right things seem in place for fate to its course. One thing is for sure: This is definitely the start of something good.heme of things, resulting in his finding a more nurturing, special relationship.

0670032506|5.0|Mr. Allen's system is surprisingly simple - the realisation that we are monkeys; that keeping to do lists in our heads causes stress; get the list on paper and the stress goes away; we can do simple physical actions with ease. Use a paper filing system; the instruction to ask of each item in our In-tray `what is the next physical action;'  the instruction to deal with each item right now if it will take less than two minutes.<br />If Mr. Allen had merely described his system 1) you wouldn't believe it and 2) worse, you wouldn't `just do it.' And JUST DOING IT does work, amazingly enough.<br />`Buy a label maker' - a surprisingly important part of Allen's system. That sounds nuts! Does he have shares in a label making company? Unlikely. Then Why? Remember the monkey approach. Simple physical tasks. Create files. Label them. Don't think. Do it. And then you look at the result. You have created it.  You have invested in the system. You are that monkey. <br />And it works! A simple system that works! <br />As the Scots say, Mr. Allen is a very canny fellow. <br />I believe that Mr. Allen wrote his book so deliberately. He makes you invest in reading the book as he makes you invest in his system when you sit there printing labels for manila files. <br />It may be nuts but it is a very clever kind of nuts ;-).
B00004YC2F|5.0|Rachmaninov's thrid piano concerto is one of the most flamboyant and romantic pieces Russian music (scratch that, ALL music) has to offer, what better pianist to play it than Arcadi Volodos a flamboyant and excellent pianist.  In my opinion, anyone that can play the Rach 3 deserves a 5 star rating irregardless of how the rest of the disk plays out.  But on this disk, the various solo piano works that follow the concerto are excellent and serve as a nice dessert after an incredible feast.  Truly a great disk that deserves to be in any refined music lover's library.
0380788624|4.0|I suppose most people start reading &quot;Snow Crash&quot; or &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; when they want an introduction into Neal Stephenson's writing. Perhaps I should have done that. Instead, I began with &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, quite an undertaking for someone who abandons rather than finishes most of the books he reads. I quite enjoyed the majority of the story, though it did take me a considerable amount of time to get through the first third of the book.  However, the rest flew by and I could not get enough of most of the storylines, wishing at the end that there was much, much more.<br />Reading about science-driven and math-driven characters took me back to my childhood when such things were highly encouraged in my life. The funny quirks of each of the characters make me smile quite a number of times. The description of one of the two fictional places that Stephenson creates for the story, Qwghlm, reads like it could have been written by a more prolific Douglas Adams.  This, by the way, is one of the highest compliments I could pay an author, as I am a die-hard Adams fan.<br />My biggest pet peeve about the novel, and it appears that this criticism is shared with many readers on Amazon, is that the ending seems a bit unfulfilling.  However, it's not that bad,  and what he's really leaving out are details that we can all surmise on our own.  I get the idea that this happens with all of Stephenson's books, but I have yet to read them (I've started &quot;Quicksilver&quot; recently, but have not finished it yet).  Stephenson addresses this criticism on his website:<br />&quot;I always write the endings that I want to, and am as satisfied with my endings as I am with any other aspect of my writing. I just have an opinion about what constitutes a good ending that is at variance with some of my readers.&quot;<br />Well, that's his prerogative.  I won't complain too much until I can write a decent 900-page story that can keep a reader with a short attention span, such as yours truly, fairly occupied.<br />I'll definitely keep reading Stephenson's work and recommend it to others, as long as one adage is kept in mind: &quot;Good things come to those who wait.&quot;  I'm sure this will be a focused mantra as I tackle the epic &quot;Baroque Cycle&quot; trilogy.
B00006RCSU|5.0|Romeo and Juliet, in my eyes, is possibly the best movies ever made. The thrilling plot captued me from the first second of the film. The story of the starcross'd lovers now has a deep place in my heart, as do Claire Danes and Leonardo Dicaprio. My friends and family, would call me obsessed with the film, it's just amazing. If you havent seen the movie, please watch it! I cant describe it with words, you just have to see it! But have a box of tissues to hand, and as I have discovered, dont try to warn Romeo not to drink the poison, HE CANT HEAR YOU!
B00003CWL6|5.0|Behind every set of eyes there is someone who you only thought you knew. Behind closed doors on tidy suburban streets life takes place in ways less perfect than we wish it really was. Yet... there IS so much beauty in the world - if only we have the eyes to see it. Lester, you DO rule!
B000002BFZ|5.0|at the first listen i was dissapointed. needless to say, this isnt 'ten' pearl jam. but then i realized exactly what i just said. this isnt the pearl jam you hear on the radio, and thats exactly what theye were going for.<br />if you dont like this album, open your mind. realize that ten and vs. pearl jam are gone. done with. this is the new, and if you dont like it, move on. period<br />this album is amazing. buy it now. thats all that can really be said about it
B000092ZYX|5.0|I went into the album without any previous knowledge of the band.  It was my first experience into the world of Radiohead, and now I listen to nothing else but Radiohead.  This album is a masterpiece, I can't even describe how it moves me every time i listen to it.  Each song is brilliant, I've hardly ever listened to a CD in its entirety, and I do every time with Hail to teh Theif.  I can't wait till radiohead comes out with their next, although I've heard rumors that they will only be releasing EPs from now on....too bad.  Anyway, I recommend this album above any other.  Radiohead is sublime.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|This is a 4-star album, which will make fans of Awake quite happy.  The songs move _really well_... the infamous DT \\"drag\\" that emerged on FII and SFAM, which faded in 6DOIT, is gone here.  I can easily listen to ToT 3 times in a row.<br />Train of Thought resumes where Glass Prison left off.  ToT could easily be renamed \\"Glass Prison Pt. 2\\".  Nothing wrong with building on an epic piece.<br />1) As I Am - 7/10 - Obviously ripping off \\"Glass Prison\\" in the first minute.  Still not a 'radio track' (only #3 may get airplay), but could appeal to new listeners, if given a chance.<br />2) This Dying Soul - 5/10 - Very strong beginning, very technical, but not at all memorable.  Weakens \\"Glass Prison\\" by representing itself as \\"Acts IV & V\\".  Still never skip it, tho.<br />3) Endless Sacrifice - 9.5/10 - Pretty much perfect.  Will be _incredible_ to hear live.  Portnoy's lame drum fills almost ruin the chorus, but this is just too close to being a classic.<br />4) Honor Thy Father - 9/10 - Simply kicks ass.  Total metal.  Didn't think DT was capable of such fresh transitions.<br />5) Vacant - 9/10 - A very pretty song.  I might have put it at the very beginning or the very end.<br />6) Stream of Consciousness - 6.5/10 - Requires a few listenings to dig, and is more simply a song without vocals than a true instrumental.  Maybe not quite enough ideas for 11 minutes.<br />7) In the Name of God - 6/10 - Political, very much like 'The Great Debate' on 6DOIT.  Vocals a little too in-the-face, striving for an operatic effect.  Musically, just a random jam.<br />Overall - 7.5/10 - Rounded up to 4/5 thanks to a very welcome heaviness.  Much closer to their true selves  (who didn't listen to \\"Glass Prison\\" and think, \\"Now they're hitting their stride\\"?)<br />Petrucci and Portnoy follow the new Metallica dictum: \\"I think we're just wired to play fast.\\"  That's their nature, and that's Dream Theater.  I'm not unhappy, since there's no longer a Pantera, Megadeth, or Metallica to assault my masochistic ears.  Softer-DT fans will be upset, reflexively, and I understand.  It's all based on expectations and hopes.  Just make the best of the situation, which isn't an unpleasant one.  The songs are good.  Phenomenal variety, and isn't that their hallmark?  I'll bet they can't wait to play ToT live.<br />My only warning is that the oft-repeated \\"jam session\\" complaint is becoming more and more valid.  Not as much \\"Where are we going?\\" as \\"Let's just go\\".  Composition, gentlemen.<br />Myung and Petrucci... you two worked together well on this album.  You should be each other's biggest fans.  Write for one another.  You know your art so well, now your mission is to be the great collaboration.  The \\"union of complexity\\" has still barely been tapped.<br />James Labrie... the songs ultimately depend on you man.  You did a solid job on this album.  Dream for the best melodies you can...  Is it me, or do I hear a new kind of voice underneath, a sort of 'antithesis' of albums past?  Very exciting...<br />Jordan Ruddess, you are the bridge between the classic Dream Theater and now.  You know the sound that must emerge.  You are Petrucci's counterpart, not \\"the keyboardist\\".  Sometimes you allow the sound, sometimes you prevent it.  So no ragtime, no gimmicks, just bring it.  Decent job on ToT.<br />Mike Portnoy, you are a great drummer, but sometimes you are not a good drummer.  A good drummer knows how to restrain himself to allow the music to breathe.  If you're going to fill, it better be awesome.  Otherwise, pause.  It might not be as fun, but I've watched high school bands with jackass drum sections who can't stop screwing around.  Consider your audience.  And don't contort your lyrics just to get them to rhyme... if it doesn't happen naturally, it shouldn't happen at all.  Aside from excess (like that's new :) your work here is smokin'.<br />Ultimately, this -is- a work of quality.  No one can deny that.<br />Thank you Dream Theater, sincerely, for the work.  We love you, and this one is deserving of 100 listenings.  Dream for inspiration.  We await the next.rk.  We love you, and this one is deserving of 100 listenings.  Dream for inspiration.

031286504X|4.0|I have been a big fan of Richard's work on The Twilight Zone and Rod Serling's Night Gallery, but have never read any of his actually works until I picked up this book.  \\"I am Legend\\" has influenced many greats from George Romero to Stephen King, but for some reason or another this book didn't blow me away like I was hoping it would.  First off, the vampires are basically just talking zombies that drink blood and are afraid of garlic and crosses. Personally, I think Romero's vision of alienation and horror in the films \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" and \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" is much suprior to that of \\"I am Legend's.\\"  Second off, I hated the ending.  I will not go into details, but I was disappointed and was left scratching my head at the logic of it.  The book is still a pretty decent read.  My favorite parts were  Neville's relationship with befriending the dog and I also liked  how the female vampires tried to lure Neville outside by using their sex appeal.<br />The short stories (at least 7 of them) on the other hand are absoultly brillant.  Espically, \\"From Shadowed Places\\", \\"Witch War\\", \\"Buried Talants\\", \\"Prey\\", \\"The Funeral\\", \\"Dance of the Dead\\", and \\"Mad House.\\"  The other stories are average at best, but these are the real keepers.  \\"From Shadowed Places\\" is one of the most creepy and unnerving things I have ever read.  \\"The Funeral\\" was always one of the most charming Night Gallery segments, and the short story is just as good.  And \\"Mad House\\" is funny, demented, and horrifying all rolled up in one.  I think I like Richard more as short story writer.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|I've never been much of a Bergman fan. I mean, there are some of his movies that I loved, some that I liked, and a lot I just didn't care for (this includes The Seventh Seal).<br />But Persona... I don't know. It's just, for lack of a better word, incredible. I know Bibi Andersson gets a lot of the praise for the film, because her performance was both engaging and haunting in its delivery. But for me, it's Liv Ullmann (who I always look forward to seeing in Bergman movies). She says only a handful of words throughout the entire film, and then relies solely on her expert ability to express herself through her eyes and body movement. Both women just managed to amaze me with their performances, something I can hardly ever find in contemporary American acting.<br />So, to sum up this review, I just want to say that as far as foreign movies go (and I've seen my fair share), Persona is one of my very favorites and I'm more than glad to see it finally come to DVD.

B0000DBJDM|2.0| <BR>there had to be a catch, i guess....... 4% PAL to NTSC speed up .... ridiculous (not neccessarily chipmunk floyd but extremely annoying to any one sensitive to the pitch and tempo of the orignal soundtrack......better than the vhs only in the sense, that it won't wear out thru multiple viewings, and the mix is certainly better..........i guess remixing the music from the original multitracks and transfering at the CORRECT speed (for NTSC ) was too much....... trouble ?!?! bottom line. Floyd deserve to be remembered better than this.......and we, in the NTSC market shouldn't support productions that are too ___________ to perform a proper NTSC xfer that retains the integrity of the original product.   hello there Universal.......WHAT? were you thinking?   oh they won't notice that nick mason sounds like a............. girl?     to all those who produce DVD's  for the world market, and slog off on proper xfers for either your PAL or NTSC markets.......we're fans, not region codes or dollar signs,   how would you like it if we took YOUR favourite movie, cd, or dvd, and sped it up 4%.......all the while knowing that someone else across the pond was listening to it at the correct speed?!?!?<br />notice how the producers of the who, kids are alright dvd, FIXED the speed problem with the original kids VHS (which suffered from a 4% speed up)     THEY did it right.....their product got BETTER.    you guys went backwards.<br />shame shame mr.maben and company.........<br />buyer beware !<br />gee, i WONDER if they are gonna put out a new directors cut mixed from the &quot;original multitracks&quot; with  a &quot;new&quot; 5.1 soundtrack blah blah blah.........RIDICULOUS.....and you wonder why people are fed up, when they keep buying their favourite movies or albums over and over and over again, because the first release was shoddy, and subsequent releases promise better quality........reminds me of the 1st edition CRAP kubrick boxset, and then the reissue, with a special documentary, that you could only get if you bought the whole damn thing AGAIN!          <br />i think we all deserve better.

If you are serious about succeeding in the financial world - and your personal life tied to it, then this book is a must-have for you and your family.<BR>The principles in this book has had a major affect on my attitude to finances and the methods to generate money.

B000089RVR|4.0|I will admit that I was originally slightly dissapointed in Dido's second album.  I only was instantly drawn to a few songs.  I guess I had hoped she would have made a few more upbeat songs (#12 on her first for example).  However, I found that the melodies did grow on me and once I actually LISTENED to the lyrics, the album actually started to become art.  Now I have become quite attatched to the album, finding it a great CD to listen to while driving in the rain (it has that feel to it).  I highly recommed it to anyone that enjoyed her first album, but be warned it is less &quot;pop&quot; sounding and more &quot;real&quot; than her first.  Also, if you own it and it didn't instantly excite you, I do suggest you listen to it and actually LISTEN.  You may be surprised.
B00006LI4S|5.0|So what if David has gained a few pounds !!!! He is still the sexiest man alive -- not to mention the best guitar player and vocalist in the world !!  I have tremendous admiration for his courage and self-confidence to break away from some of the old Pink Floyd music and do his \\"own thing\\" during this concert.  We've all changed in the past 30 years and David Gilmour has proven that even after all these years -- he RULES !!!!!  This DVD is to die for !! I've worn it out watching and listening to it.  Long live the Queen !!  She knows it too !!!
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanescence must be huge Lacuna Coil fans.<br />Their musical style and Amy's voice are remarkably similar, except Lacuna Coil released their debut about 5 years ago.<br />Not that this is a bad thing.  I like Lacuna Coil's sound, and I like Evanescence's sound.  Vocalist Amy Lee's voice is beautiful and conveys a full range of emotion and is full of power.  She is also a wonderful pianist, as displayed on My Immortal.<br />The band is really Amy and the guys.  Their guitarist is a very capable player, but lead licks aren't his cup of tea, and they are kept to a minimum.<br />My favorites:  My Immortal, Bring Me to Life, Tourniquet<br />All in all, a good album.
B000069AUI|5.0|I've fallen in love with Coldplay after listening to this disc for the past 3 weeks, pretty much non-stop.<br />Everything that can be said about them has already been said, so I'll just say that you don't get much more meaningful, inspired, and beautiful music than Coldplay.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I was not at all into Pink when she came out with her first album. Her 2nd album, Missundaztood blew me away, and I have been anticipating this release. It did not dissapoint, it completely rocks! But I do think some of the songs are not right off the bat as hit worthy as her old CD. There were so many catchy songs on Missundaztood and you could tell right away they were &quot;single-worthy&quot;. This does not mean I do not love them. My first listen thru, my immediate favorites were Trouble, God is a DJ, and Walk Away. I would think Walk Away would be a great single.<br />There is not one song on this CD I skip. There are 1 or 2 hip-hoppy songs, ballads, and my personal favorite~the angst filled rock-out-head-bang songs. Great Job Pink!
B00008LDPU|5.0|Any fan of the Matrix would love this collection of short movies, that is, if they would bring themselves to watch it.  I have asked so many people at school if they have watched it and they haven't!  It explains so much about what's going on in the main three movies.  I have this feeling that those who thought the Matrix series was &quot;too confusing&quot; didn't  watch this.  Okay.  If you don't believe me, here's the breakdown:<br />Final Flight of the Osiris: A great short that explains what happens between movies #1 and #2.  If you liked Final Fantasy, you'll like this.<BR>Second Renaissance Parts 1&amp; 2:  Two amazing animes describing how the world came to be in the first Matrix.  This really helps to understand each movie.<BR>Kid's Story: I loved this one.  Remember that kid in Reloaded and Revolutions?  This is his story.  The animation is very original.<BR>World Record:This was probably my favorite one.  This short  made me really feel for the main character.  The action is great and there is a pause that will make you want to say,&quot;Move!  Run!  Damn it, do something!&quot;  Really, it will.<br />There are others that are just as good like Detective Story and Program.  I don't have time to go through each one, but I would if I could.  Try this out, especially if you are a die hard fan.
0385504209|5.0|Wonderful Book, fast service!
B000092ZYX|5.0|i'm really amazed and amused by how people react to this album along with kid a and amnesiac. and these same people often do like the bends and ok computer. while the bends is a very &quot;normal&quot;, to use that silly word, record, actually too normal, OK computer was a really good rock record, but a ROCK record...meaning it is possible to classify that record, label it, meaning it's still, in spite of its creativity, uniqueness and intelligence a not-entirely-special release. the three albums that followed are OK computer that is entirely special, something impossible to label. BUT, these records are NOT &quot;experimentation&quot; for the sake of experimentation and god knows what else people write about it. first of all, it's not even experimental music at all, people who go on and on about how experimental these records are have obviously never heard experimental music in their lives. these records ARE daring, challenging, creative, different, fresh, arty...pop records. and that's great, but its not experimental music. <br />there is so much substance, so much passion, so much honesty in this record, as well as in kid a and amnesiac, that i'm amazed how so many reviewers and critics fail to see this and comprehend this. what was implicit in OK computer, became explicit in those three records following, they are true evolution from OK computer, and there is very obvious continuity between all radiohead records. it is steady growth, evolving manifestation of what they are, and always were, all about. so, don't whine about the bends and OK computer, since kid a, amnesiac and hail to the thief are by far superior records to those in every aspect.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|im a Dream Theater fan, i bought all their albums and of course i bought this at the moment i saw it in a store and after 10 or more listen i can say that this album is a MASTERPIECE..
B000002MUN|4.0|This CD has a relaxed, loose, rootsy feel, whether the sound is folk, folk-rock, soft rock, raunchy blues or, on \\"You Wreck Me\\", the old 70's Heartbreakers sound. There are moments that are reminiscent of the Beatles or of The Band, but overall it's pure Petty being himself. I have mixed feelings about the production. It's true that the recording is painstakingly perfect, but I feel it's a bit overproduced - though not to the extent of the Jeff Lynne work preceding it. As someone else noted below, this is Petty's best work lyrically since \\"Hard Promises\\" a decade earlier, and the most moving songs are divorce-inspired. Lyrics on the title track, \\"Only a Broken Heart\\", \\"Don't Fade On Me\\", \\"To Find a Friend,\\" and \\"Hard On Me\\" stand out.  Otherwise the lyrics are more lightweight, but beautifully crafted, as is most of the music.<br />The CD runs well over an hour and might have been better if some songs had been cut. The first 9 tracks are near-perfect, then the CD becomes uneven. \\"Cabin Down Below\\" has the same raunchy feel as \\"Honey Bee,\\" but is kind of weak; I'd rather hear \\"Come On Down to My Boat\\". \\"A Higher Place\\" is another divorce song with a bit of a Romantics/\\"What I Like About You\\" feel to its acoustic guitar riff, and isn't bad. The last 3 songs might just as well have been left off.<br />Unless you demand the energy of a \\"Damn the Torpedoes\\", fans of Petty's early or late work should find much to like here. There's nothing as catchy as his best songs, just a consistent low-key beauty.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I've never been a huge Britney fan but after watching her ABC &quot;In The Zone&quot; special last night, I was intrigued and thought I'd pick up this album. It's really catchy and fun! Also, since I'm a huge Madonna fan, I figured it would be a great addition to my CD collection. There are a lot of fun songs on this album. It reminds me a lot of Madonna's &quot;Music&quot; album. If you are a fan of Madonna's, you'll love this one. Favorite songs are &quot;Me Against the Music, , Breathe On Me, Toxic, and Brave New Girl. There's something for everyone on this one. You won't be disappointed. If nothing else, it's a great workout CD.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney proves she's all grown up with her funkiest album to date. Finally a Britney album where you can play it all the way through without skipping a few tracks. As a whole. In the Zone is an edgier, more dance club oriented album. Songs like \\"Touch of My Hand\\"and \\"Breath on Me\\" will certainly get you in the mood with Britney's moans and groans, while the funk laden tracks \\"I Got That Boom Boom\\" and \\"Toxic\\" will make you want to dance at the clubs. \\"Outrageous\\" adds a middle eastern vibe, and \\"The Hook Up\\" gives a reggae/dancehall vibe. The poppiest song on the album is \\"Brave New Girl\\". A catchy, fun song that is perfect for cranking up while driving with all the windows down. In the Zone finally gives us some decent ballads. \\"Shadow\\" is stunning and \\"Everytime\\" is sweet and sincere with a lovely piano arrangement backing it up. Britneys vocals have only gotten thinner and thinner, and this time the producers go more out of their way to mask her voice. This time however, the songs are so brilliantly crafted it doesn't even matter to me anymore. Overall a remarkable album. I honestly did not expect anything like this from Britney. The best album of the year...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Easily the best work she has done to date.  The CD is solid from start to finish with no real weak songs at all.  Breathe on Me is going to be a big club hit.  I also liked The Hook Up and Touch of My Hand.  It seems to be popular to critize Britney lately, but this is a great CD and the public and press will have to realize she can't stay 15 forever.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|This is Whitney's best album EVER.  I AM NOT KIDDING.  I couldn't believe my ears, every song builds up to an incredibe climax, there are no words to begin to describe.  This takes last year's &quot;Just Whitney&quot; and smashes it into little pieces.  Heck it even is better then The Bodyguard soundtrack.  She holds notes and does vocal runs like never before.<br />Her voice has become STRONGER and DEEPER.  She can still hit the high notes and they are with more power, the voice however isn't innocent like in 1985-1995, it's more RAW, DRAMATIC, GRANDIOSE.  And I LOVE THAT! Just put your headphones high and be amazed!!!<br />The tracklisting is the following (I also put my rating):<BR>1. The First Noel... B+<BR>2. The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)... A+<BR>3. Little Drummer Boy (featuring Bobbi Kristina Brown)... A+<BR>4. One Wish (For Christmas) ... A<BR>5. O Holy Night ... A+<BR>6. I'll be Home For Christmas ... B+<BR>7. Deck the Halls/Silent Night ... A+<BR>8. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas ... B+<BR>9. O Come O Come Emmanuel ... A<BR>10. Who Would Imagine A King (From Preacher's Wife) ... A-<BR>11. Joy to the World (From Preacher's Wife) ... A+<br />The last 2 songs are old ones but I'm glad they are included.  But the new tracks are all INCREDIBLE.  With this album, Whitney has truly delivered.  This cd is so full of emotion and heart, nobody will ever come close to Whitney Houston.  HIGHLY recommended.  VERY HIGHLY.
0385504209|1.0|Yes, it reads smoothly and quickly.  So do the newspapers displayed and sold at supermarket checkouts.<br />No, it carries no original information or message.  It relies on sly innuendo to mulct credulous readers.
B00005Y7L4|3.0|It's ok, but the book is infinitely better.  I was really expecting a lot more after reading the book and reading the other glowing reviews.  I guess there was no choice about using very young actors considering the plot, but with the exception of Noriko, Takako, Shuya, Shogo and of course Kitano, the rest of the acting was pretty bush-league.  If you like reading, skip the movie and just read the book.  So much more than what you see on screen is contained between those magical pages.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is truly a great CD for any Beatles fans. [...]They are completely remastered and reworked and sound a whole lot better to.   Take The Long And Winding Road. The horrible bass track that appeared in Anthology 3 (and in the original Let It Be release, though it was obscured somewhat by the orchestra) has been completely redone from scratch. The little microphone bumps that were a small distraction, as well as other anomalies in the older versions are gone, and the vocal has been mixed up to a higher volume. The same goes for Let It Be. The vocal is again mixed up higher, and everything else sounds cleaner than what appeared on the Anthology versions. All the anomalies, such as the wrong piano chord at 2:58 have been fixed.   The Anthology songs were taken from the original recordings and just copied onto the Anthology series. The Let It Be...Naked songs are completely remastered under the supervision of Paul McCartney, and they sound amazing
1591391105|5.0|As an author who writes and lectures on success, personal achievement, and leadership I try to crack open as many books on these topics as I can. But separating the wheat from the chaff if often a struggle in the first instance; with all of the books coming out these days you never know what you are going to get! But having read Michael Watkins material before when I was completing my MBA some years back, it was an easy choice.<br /><br />Watkins really has put together a wonderful piece of literary insight that address critical leadership success issues and provides excellent techniques for men and women who have, are about to, or are aspiring to get hold of the reigns. I highly recommended it!<br /><br />Reviewed by: James L. Clark, MBA, MSc., PhD Candidate is a serial infopreneur whose book Wading Through The Crap: How To Start Living The Successful Life You Have Always Wanted (ISBN 0972697551) has received rave reviews.

B0000CAQ27|2.0|Just when I thought we had moved out of the &quot;Bubblegum Pop&quot; phase, we move straight into the &quot;Pop Rock&quot; phase. I cannot stand Pink's music. This so-called &quot;Rock&quot; is horrible,corny pop songs with a slight guitar in the background. Pink is trying to move herself out of this pop princess thing, but this isn't the way to do it. ARGH, I hate her songs! And the troubling part is, she is one of the few in this new wave of pop that can actually sing! Too bad it's wasted on annoying dance/pop rock songs like &quot;Trouble&quot;. Her whole gimmick is that she's real. She's not like Britney. She writes her own songs. But who give's a flying (explicitive) if she writes her own songs if they suck??? Just look at the lyrics to &quot;Trouble&quot;. <br />&quot;I'm trouble. Yeah trouble now, I'm trouble Ya'll, I got trouble in my town. If you see me coming down the street then you know it's time to goooooooooo...&quot;<br />LOL That's HORRIBLE! Pink is for teenage girls who wanna hate their parents cuz all the cool kids do it. Pink has potential, but she certainly isn't using it. Her career is destined for Radio Disney. She get two stars though because she can sing. It's a shame.
B0000D96NW|5.0|I have no idea when this album is supposed to hit stores in the US, but I already have it..so there. Guitarist Ahrue Luster left the band last year after recording 1999`s `The Burning Red`, and 2001`s `Supercharger` while in the fold. Both albums showed a band in an extremely experimantal state. The results were both compelling and repelling. I own both albums and frankly enjoy them, but after hearing TTAOE I find myself wondering just what they were doing. Through The Ashes Of Empires shows flashes of the previous two albums, but relies heavily on the brutality of 1995`s `Burn My Eyes` and 1997`s `The More Things Change`...and who said that was a bad thing? New axe man Phil Demmel (who was with vocal/guitar man Robb Flynn in Vio-lence) seems to have lit a fire under the band, because this album is about as subtle as a heart attack. David McClain`s drum work is absolutely off the charts, the mix by Colin Richardson is the classic MH sound that he helped engineer: god of thunder drums, and a wall of guitars. Robb Flynn`s voice sounds the best that it ever has, and his songwriting has taken yet another giant leap forward. Also bassist Adam Duce has returned to adding backing vocals, his contribution in that field has grown to adding trade off rants at key points, the results are effective to say the least. Kicking off with &quot;Imperium&quot;, as good of an album opener as they`ve ever played, which at one point features an Iron Maiden-like 2 guitar harmony. Flynn admitted that he finally will allow himself do such a thing. Through the 53 minutes of this disc, there are many surprises. &quot;Days Turn Blue To Gray&quot; features a breakdown in the middle that I can best describe as Coldplay with Dave Lombardo in the background. Let`s not forget &quot;Left Unfinished&quot; a song that displays Flynn`s love for his adopted parents, and a blistering resentment for his biological parents. There are too many great moments in this album for me to accurately describe. My advice to you is to get a hold of this album any way you can. This is by no means some Limp Bizkit-like attempt to be cool with `da kids`. This is serious, grown-ups metal.This band is not by any means back, they never left...you people just never noticed...shame on you
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This is Britney Spears worse cd ever! i am very \\"upset\\" that i got it! Whoever is thinking about buying this cd listen... britneys first cd was good second really good three the best cd ever! than came this one it is horrible! she trys to rap in it and sound sexy and lyrics are crap! i only give it one star cause she has like three good songs! Help yourselfs out don't buy it!
B00006RU5B|5.0|lets face it,, today's modern rock scene could NOT be any worse-from P.O.D. to Puddle of Mudd, Linkin Park to Nickelback, 3 Doors Down to the god-awful Good Charlotte, its just, total crap...<br />However, THIS is a true exception! I dont think there could have been a better combination than the awesome voice of Chris Cornell(my 3rd favorite vocalist after Iced Earth's Matt Borlow and Dream Theater's James LaBrie) and the awesome guitar effects of Tom Morello<br />This whole cd is excellent but my favorites are probably &quot;Gasoline&quot; and &quot;I Am The Highway&quot;<br />Good job Chris and Tom, thanks for showing 3 Doors Down how ROCK is done!
B00005JMFR|5.0|If you can understand this movie you will love it.  Read all the reviews you want but comprehension is the key.  All of the people I talked to that did not like this movie gave me very shallow reasons why they didn't.  When I quizzed them on the movie they just gave me more complaints.  I recommend this movie to anyone who can understand subtle hints without them being pushed down your throat.  This movie is not for those with a lazy mind.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|yes,, Britney spears is smokin hot,,, so when a new cd comes out that means 3 or 4 new hot videos... but it also means 3 or 4 new god-awful songs! <br />Who the hell over the age of 12 is actually dumb enough to LISTEN to this garbage?? As if Avril and Hillary Duff arent bad enough, then Christina Aguilera had to come back, and now her again! Total garbage....<br />Buy this cd only if you want to look at the booklet pictures, in the mean-time music wise I'll be picking up that new Dream Theater cd...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think this is one of Britney's best albums.  The fact that she had input on this one also makes it awesome.  I have to say that my favorite songs are &quot;Toxic&quot; and &quot;Breathe on Me&quot;.  It shows how much she has grown up and more people can relate now that she has lived.
6305308659|5.0|The 1998 film &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, written and directed by Gary Ross (who also directed, &amp; wrote the screenplay, for the 2003 film &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;), is an exploration of conformity versus individuality.  Two teenagers, David Wagner (Tobey Macguire, who played the lead role in the 2002 film &quot;Spider-Man&quot;) and Jennifer Wagner (Reese Witherspoon, who played &quot;Elle Woods&quot; in the 2001 film &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; and its 2003 sequel), are catapulted into the world of a fictitious 1950's television sitcom called &quot;Pleasantville&quot; following a visit from a very odd television repairman (played by the very well known Don Knotts).  Upon entering the world of &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, David and Jennifer (who have taken on the roles of the show's characters Bud &amp; Mary Sue Parker) become black and white like the rest of the characters and the show itself.  However, as time passes, David and Jennifer's modern ways begin to transform the people and town of Pleasantville: things and people begin to acquire color, books that have always been blank contain printed words, high school teams that always won begin to loose, etc.  Some people are very excited by the changes, but others aren't.<br />The two most interesting regular Pleasantville characters are Bud &amp; Mary Sue's mother, Betty Parker (Joan Allen, who has received three separate Oscar nominations for her roles in the films &quot;Nixon&quot; in 1995, &quot;The Crucible&quot; in 1996 and &quot;The Contender&quot; in 2000) and Bud's boss: soda-shop owner Bill Johnson (Jeff Daniels in probably one of his best roles).  Bill finds the ability to express himself through art, and Betty discovers many new things about herself.  Other memorable characters in the film include Bud &amp; Mary Sue's father George Parker (William H. Macy), David and Jennifer's Mom (Jane Kaczmarek, of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; TV-series fame), Bud's friend Skip Martin (Paul Walker) and Big Bob (J.T. Walsh, 1943-1998, who played John Ehrlichman in the 1995 film &quot;Nixon&quot;).<br />Overall, I rate &quot;Pleasantville&quot; with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It's superb cinematography, special effects, plot, dialog and acting make the film completely engaging; and its underlying message is beautifully illustrated throughout.
078322799X|5.0|When I first saw this on the television I was expecting dark humour coupled with emense amounts of blood and gore along the lines of Bad Taste and Braindead(Known to Americans as Dead Alive). Then I heard it was only a 15 (somewhere in between a PG-13 and R)so I began to wonder if it was worth watching, I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did because I would have missed out on a great movie. <BR>The story follows the miss-adventures of would be Exorcist Micheal J Fox, as he scams the public with his mock excorisms. But He can actually see ghosts and three of them help him with him scam. But soon people in town start dying and it looks like the murderer is death himself. Wrongly accussed of the murders by the extremely strage detective Fox's character must solve the murders before he gets sent down for them.<BR>This film isn't all seriousnous though the three ghosts who befriend Fox provide some ammusing jokes and the overall tone of the movie is generally light hearted fun.
B00006IU73|4.0|I bought In Absentia because several Radiohead reviewers said that PT was vastly superior. Certainly In Absentia lacks the jagged edges, cryptic lyrics, tendency to pretentiousness, inconsistency, and audience-be-damned attitude characteristic of Radiohead, which is exactly why PT is NOT superior.<br />In Absentia consists of a take-no-prisoners band playing take-no-chances music. All the grit and imperfections have wound up in the cover art. Every note, texture, harmony is flawless--to a fault.<br />A band's reach should exceed its grasp.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|It time to get out your old worn copy of Let It Be and dust it off for the &quot;Pepsi Challenge&quot;.  <br />Everyone wants something different from an album - this varies even more when it's a Beatles album.  Finer points can be endlessly debated for years to come, but Naked offers pristine sound quality and alternate takes (not Anthology different but different) giving this album something new aurally. This album is gorgeous in its execution and simplicity.  There is plenty of reading material in the booklet to keep you occupied during reapeated listenings, and the second disc is a lot of fun.  <br />I love this album but I do not love the EMI hatred found in the inset.  I know that this is copyrighted material without a condescending explanation spelling it out for me. I also know that I will make a copy of this album to throw in the car so I don't have to repurchase this album repeatedly. It's a shame that the disdain of the record companies has to be printed in the work of the artist.  <br />I don't think I'll be ditching my copy of Let It Be in favor of Naked, but it is a warm and welcome companion piece to my collection. &quot;Across the Universe&quot; alone made the price of admission worthwhile to me being unshackled of unnecessary strings, choirs, bird noises and other tweetings.
B0000024ZC|3.0|\\"Three Friends\\" was released in 1972 and I think it's Gentle Giant's most normal album ever....it's definitely not as weird and quirky and complex as their other albums, though it is still a very progressive album. If you find some of G.G.'s other albums like \\"Acquiring The Taste\\" and \\"In a Glass House\\" a bit too complex and slightly annoying and headache-inducing, then you will probably like this album. Even though it's not my favorite album of theirs, I WOULD recommend it to someone as an introduction to Gentle Giant, along with \\"Freehand\\".<br />  The line-up on this album was Derek Shulman on vocals and sax, Phil Shulman on vocals and trumpet, Ray Shulman on bass, violin, guitar and vocals, Gary Green on guitar, Kerry Minnear on keyboards, vibes, recorders, etc..and Malcolm Mortimore on drums. Of the three vocalists, Derek, with his almost operatic bass/baritone, was their strongest vocalist and could project more than the other two. Kerry had a beautiful church boy tenor, though his voice wasn't as strong in concert. His singing is featured on \\"Schooldays\\". Phil, who would leave after their next album, had a very quiet and almost inaudible voice. His voice was SO quiet, one needed a microscope or a stethoscope to hear it! You can barely hear him on \\"Schooldays\\" and the first half of \\"Peel The Paint\\".<br />  Of the songs, the first track has a very complicated, but catchy and slightly dangerous riff to it, that I think is repeated a bit too much. \\"Schooldays\\" is the most laid back and quiet song on the album and has some very typical Gentle Giant vocal rounds. It has a bit of a jazzy feel to it. I could never get into this song for some mysterioso reason! \\"Working All Day\\" is a bit louder and heavier and has Derek singing along with the sax and/or tuba line. Kind of funny, actually!<br />  I prefer the second half of the album, which starts off with \\"Peel The Paint\\", which is my favorite song on the album. As stated earlier, the first half of the song is rather quiet and has a barely audible vocal from Phil and some xylophone and/or vibraphone playing. The second half of the song is very heavy, with a very meaty vocal from Derek and one of the longest and heaviest guitar solos by Gary Green ever. This is accompanied by some rather frantic drumming. Gentle Giant were many things in their ten year career, but they rarely ever were heavy metal and they really rock out during this song!<br />  The last two songs are very pleasant progressive rock tunes and are easy to listen to. \\"Mister Class and Quality\\" has Derek's strongest singing up to that point, along with a quirky little guitar/violin and organ riff. The last song has mellotron and organ and a very heavy guitar riff.<br />  Gentle Giant have released much more exciting and adventurous albums than \\"Three Friends\\", but this is still a very enjoyable  and very musical progressive rock album! Recommended!<br />  (A note to collectors: the cover for the U.S lp and U.S. cd is also the cover for their first album!)uiet and has a barely audible vocal from Phil and some xylophone and/or vibraphone playing.

B00006IU73|5.0|When I first heard of Porcupine Tree (and I can't remember if it was through Lost America or Mike Portnoy being quoted), I thought &quot;Hmmm...&quot;.<br />Then I bought this disc...Wow!!<br />Textured, harmonious, beautifully produced, bright music with disturbing lyrics (witness 'Blackest Eyes'). Every song on this disc stands out brightly, with 'Muzak' and 'Blackest Eyes' being among my favorite.<br />The Pink Floyd reference is really unjust, and though the influence can be seen, 'The Creator had a Mastertape' should help quash this statement.<br />Even folks who aren't fans of prog, metal, or atmospheric music will find something to like here. Fans of the above will find something as well.<br />A jewel in anyone's collection!
B00004BZ16|5.0|The Clash is a brilliant band. I love how in &quot;Sandinista&quot; they can explore diffrent kind of music style and still sound great. I never got bored listening to &quot;Sandinasta&quot;. I'm 17 years old and I hate how the bands today are! They all sound the same and they don't take risk. The bands back then took risk like &quot;The Clash&quot; and that why i like them.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|With ToT, Dream Theater continues on the aggressive path that started on 'Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence', and comes up with a seven track disc that blends many of their influences including Alice In Chains, Metallica, Iron Maiden, and Tool. Some modern influences show up as well, with the added bonus of a singer that doesn't sound bored by what he is singing (unlike System of a Down and others).<br />This album contains many tracks I'd love to see live. There is just so much energy being expelled here.<br />Though I long for a revisit of the sound and songwriting found on 'Awake', with its many diverse influences from classic prog to blues, this album sums up where DT has been headed for the past four years, though Rudess made me think of Kevin Moore era DT with his performance here.<br />Besides, bands that don't experiment with different styles really get boring after awhile (re Nickelback, Three Doors Down, Korn, etc).<br />If you were a fan of the last disc, especially side 1, than you'll like what you find here. 4 1/2 stars!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Not Star Trek the series. Not Star Trek \\"The Movie\\"... Star Trek the \\"Mistake\\".<br />How many times will ignorant interpretations of bad ratings systems cause networks to miss the boat when it comes to what we want to see on television? I have come to expect so little from the boob-tube that it amazes me how much in shock I was when this show was suddenly cancelled.<br />All the praise from the other reviews and other sources on the net are well deserved. The language, stories, characters, history, images, had the markings of something that would have grown to be great. If the market share of our kind is truly too small to influence bottom-line-tunnel-vision business, I am thankful that at least we have a chance to grab this bit of gold on DVD so we can enjoy it with our friends while the sheep numb their minds on the ratings kings. These will be valuable. Buy them, and see what it's like when writers actually work for a living.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Oh my! I was ready NOT to like this album, but is is GREAT! Fans of dance will really like this album-there are lots of upbeat tracks, and only a few slow ones. Britney got the top producers for this album in my opinion-including one of my favorite (and REALLY underappreciated in the US) Cathy Dennis for songs like Showdown and Toxic.<br />-Here is a breakdown of the songs:<BR>MATM f/Madonna-Great song! Drum n' Bass! Very upbeat, I am sure you have heard it! 9/10<BR>2)(I got that) Boom Boom-is a GREAT party song. It kind of reminds me of \\"Get Low\\" by lil jon and the eastsiders-very urban, very party-ish. NOT like anything Britney has tried before. It is more of a harder edge/rap song! 9/10<BR>3)Showdown-GREAT song-medium tempo, basically talking about a \\"Showdown\\" and how breaking up can lead to good making up. Fun song! 9/10<BR>4)Breathe on Me-Very sensual, very nice and sexy! It sounds like something Kylie Minogue would do-which is good! Very club vibe-y, but not super fast paced VERY GOOD! 9/10<BR>5)Early Mornin'-This song she did with Moby-it is not my favorite, this one is probably one of my LEAST favorite on the album. It is just talking about Britney being out late the night before. Semi alternative-ish 6/10<BR>6)Toxic-Great song (again!) Semi-frantic, with violins in certain parts of the song, it reminded me of superhero music (if that makes sense! 9/10<BR>7)Outrageous-this song was written by R.Kelly-if you like his style you will love this song. It is very urban, and sounds like...an R.Kelly song! Kind of reminds me of \\"Ignition Remix\\" by R. Kelly-just the style of the sound. Britney says Outrageous many many times! 9/10<BR>8)Touch of My Hand-one of the BEST songs on the album, and it is supposedly talking about..er, self pleasure, but honestly, I don't think I would've known that by listening to the song, if she didn't say it was about self-pleasure! Very slow, sensual, NOT a slow song though! 10/10 one of the BEST slower Britney songs!!!<BR>9)The Hook Up-this one is ok..I don't have much to say about it though! 8/10<BR>10)Shadow-slow song. Reminds me EXACTLY of Avril Lavigne's \\"I'm with You\\" same type of slow song and beat..it is pretty good 8/10<BR>11)Brave New Girl-pretty good-kind of 60's vibe on this one-surfer-ish....8/10<BR>12)Everytime-slow song, about regrets, nice slow song. I am not a fan of slow songs though so this one gets an 8<BR>13-MATM f/Madonna Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix-this one is very middle eastern sounding. Not a bad remix, but not what I was looking for. I actually like the \\"Dragon Man\\" remix of MATM that is a download if you buy an album from (another retailer)<BR>..If you can find the song I've Just Begun (Having My Fun) I also recommend that song. It is very 70's vibe-y and great! I don't know why it wasn't included on the album itself? This one is probably one of my favorite tracks!!!<BR>BUY THIS ALBUM!!! :)
B0000CFW87|5.0|I have been hooked on Josh Groban's voice since I first heard him sing on Ally McBeal some 2-3 years ago. I practically wore out my first Josh CD because I loved it so. <BR>Closer is a good CD, but probably not as good as the first. His voice is spectacular and his delivery is impecable. The only thing I was disappointed by was that it seemed that most of these songs were slow and less upbeat then the first CD. I would love to hear Josh just cut loose and sing the things he really loves. <BR>I was lucky to get the internet limited edition CD that has 4 extra songs on it, he does an interesting arrangement of Lincoln Park's &quot; My December&quot; and a melancholy rendition of the old Micheal Jackson song &quot;She's Out of My Life&quot;. <BR>I am trying to get everyone I can hooked onto Josh because it's so rare to find someone with real talent in today's music world of prefab groups and artists. Josh is the real deal, he doesn't need fancy dance steps and lipsyncing, his talent stands alone. <BR>I have my ticket and am looking forward to seeing him in concert. I have no doubt that he will continue not to disappoint. <BR>To make it simple: BUY THIS CD!
B00008438V|1.0|This DVD tries to suck the buyer in by telling him/her that this DVD contains music from the original score...which it might have, but along with that there comes the added bonus of missing lines that made the movie a classic...for instance the &quot;If there's one thing I know its female stats...&quot; line is completely gone.  There are others but I don't have enough room to put them here.  Not since the latest Animal House with the missing &quot;Have you seen my rolling papers?&quot; line has a DVD release been so disappointing.  While these things may not matter to the majority of you viewers, it will to some of you so you have been warned.
B00005JM02|4.0|&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; sensitively explores the inner lives of families who survive the sudden, unexpected deaths of loved ones. It is perhaps the finest cinematic portrayal of a family in grief since Bergman's &quot;Fanny and Alexander,&quot; upon which &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is based, and a model for &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;'s handling of John Ritter's untimely demise<br />As the story begins, a grammar school-age clownfish named Nemo and his father, Marlin, gaze into the maw of unyielding death as Nemo's beloved mother is cruelly snatched via the jaws of a predator. What follows is a dreamlike dirge of grief, as Nemo invites his own ceaseless demise by frolicking with sharks and swimming recklessly among jellyfish that resemble pink mushroom clouds -- the shape of modern anxiety.<br />Nemo is guided in his journey to the brink of the abyss and back by  a blue tang named Dory. Playing the voice of Dory, Ellen DeGeneres almost seems to channel  Gunnar Björnstrand, who played a similar role as Jons the Squire in Bergman's &quot;The Seventh Seal.&quot; It was an inspired coup to cast DeGeneres, who is better known for her light-hearted roles but has previously demonstrated her range in the exquisitely depressed character of Sgt. Rita Pompano in &quot;Goodbye Lover.&quot;<br />&quot;Finding Nemo&quot; delves deep into the chasm of the human heart confronted with death, as deep as the Mariana Trench, then resurfaces, sparkling with little cold droplets of hope.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Okay, so Britney doesn't have the most beautiful voice on the planet, but she knows what beats and sounds mix well with it.  Out of the four albums that she has put out so far, this is clearly her best one.  Although the lyrics aren't deep and profound, most of the songs on here are pretty upbeat and get your head bobbin'.  Her new album is all about letting loose and just having FUN!  And if people can't appreciate the fact that music should also have this kind of affect on people, then obviously this album is not for them.  But if you are, then you should definitely get this album!  If you're stuck in traffic, doing some chores around the house, or even working out, then start playing this CD because time will fly by a lot faster with this new album. And don't forget to put it on repeat!  =0)
6304602979|4.0|What can you say about a guy who has the King as a Guardian Angel?  Either he is as star-crossed as the King was, or he is very lucky.  Lots of action and hilarious dialogue.  With all the cameos, you may even find your favorite actor in here.
0930289234|5.0|There has not been a book since &quot;1984&quot; that so firmly places its finger on the human condition, nuclear politics, and the disintegration of the American Dream.  I say this not only including the &quot;funny-books&quot; with which this title shares its genre, but to the entire scope of &quot;real&quot; literature as well.  It can not be stated more clearly:  This is an important book.  It represents at its most basic level the desire for us as humans to return to a state of irresponsibility, to let someone else handle all of our problems, and how we are willing to hand all of that over at the first opportunity.<br />  The fact that America's nuclear weapons are not pointed at anyone in particular right now does not decrease this book's impact, nor does the fact that Russia seems willing to sell them to anyone in particular.  This book does not so much capture a moment in time as it relates that moment to how we live each second of our day.  In Miller's &quot;Dark Night&quot;, Jim Gordon thinks at one point of how FDR may have had prior knowledge of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.  How do you judge such a thing, he wonders to himself.  Soon, he realizes, all you can do is throw your hands up and realize that it's all too big for you, that you'll just have to trust that decision to somebody else, and pray that you'll never have to make such a decision yourself.  In a nutshell, that is what &quot;Watchmen&quot; is about.<br />  I would also like to quickly respond to other comments regarding the &quot;perfunctory&quot; quality of the art.  Dave Gibbons has crammed so much into those tiny nine panels on each page that the story could be read clearly with no dialogue whatsoever.  Unlike film, which is meant to be seen without constant review, comics are a medium which invites multiple layered readings.  This is percieved as a weakness of the form by many who are uninitiated, yet I believe the complexity of Joyce is present to all who truly understand how toread between the gutters(industry-speak for the area between panels).<br />  Putting the fancy-talk aside, though, this book remains at its core a great read.  The characters are fully formed, changing individuals.  The dialogue is informed and intelligent, and the art never cheats, never gives us an irregular bicep, veins rippling across its skin. I cannot reccomend this book enough, but whether you accept this or not is your choice, which I guess is what &quot;Watchmen&quot; is all about.
6304479689|5.0|There are only three released videos filmed of Elvis &quot;live&quot; during performances. This is one of the three and the only one to show the King on tour. For that reason, it is to be treasured. But not only for this: it also shows Elvis performing his early seventies numbers, and his interaction with the audiences of that time. Every appearance by the King is moving, shows his character and his mischievous nature and most of all - shows every new generation of fans what it was like to see the one and only King of Rock n Roll perform. Why this is not on DVD baffles me. Although re-editing of the movie would make it tighter, the live performance segments make up for everything! Hey, MGM/Turner, whoever! please, do you have any plans for this to be on DVD ? Are there any more Elvis performances locked away in a vault that you could put on DVD ? Elvis fans all over the world are a growing force and would LOVE to see more of the real Elvis - trust me, these performances are nothing like the inane Elvis movies which are so readily available! THIS is the real reason they called him the KING!!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|i love this cd! I think Britney is a great singer and a great person. she needs more credit for the person she is, and the music she sings. you deserves better. sure ppl make mistakes but britney is awesome in my book! this is an great album to dance to and let loose! woohoo go out and get it!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I still love the old school BRIT with her pop music, but this album shows her grown up side and i would not recommend it for the little ones. i absolutely love it....
B0000DD7LB|2.0|OK, i think Britney is beautiful and is a VERY VERY tallent dancer... but her music... its horrible. The only song worth listening to on this C.D is &quot;Everytime&quot; but when she sang it live on SNL she sounded like she was having trouble, she was breathing after every other word. Myself being a singer, i have a wide range of what i consitter tallented, when it comes to her voice... she has none. I'm sorry sweet heart, you seem like a very nice girl- but stick to dancing.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|What I love about Dream Theater is that they keep the fan/listener guessing.  You never know what these guys are going to do next.  I disagree with all the naysayers that say this is nu-breed metal.  This is Dream Theater doing what they do best, constantly changing.  Nu-breed metal, while some of it is good, is uninspired junk usually.  DT continues to have heart and soul when it comes to their music, and I feel that this is one of their best.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Worldwide Underground..OK,OK, so you only get 10 songs. Well really 8, but the eight are good. Erykah was having some fun and being creative as I was expecting. Remember this is a EP(Extended Play) and was just that.. Extended Play. This is not a FULL album. These tracks are suppose to remind us of music that was &quot;Back In The Day.&quot; This was to go along with the format of movie &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (At least that was my perception of it.) I love this cd. It's fun and it makes me think of the good times in my life. Isn't that what music is suppose to do anyway?<br />As far those who are saying that she used a few verses from her debut album. My answer is..so what! At least they are her's and not someone elses. <br />My favorite tracks are.<br />Bump it (the beat beat is banging and Erykah is riding the waves smoothly)<br />Back in the days (now this you can do bump and freak off of this joint.)<br />I want you (The intro alone is enough to give it a star. Great lyrics and yes they are repetitive, but look at the baseline of the track. How else was she going to sing it!)<br />Woo (Get your friends and party with this one)<br />Danger (Tight tracks and the lyrics will make you laugh. Try saying the chorus fast three times. They even had to ask her what she was saying. Yes she used a slice of her hit &quot;Other side of game.&quot; but this was a continuation of this track. Janet did the same thing with &quot;Funny how time flies by and Someday is tonight.&quot;<br />Love of my life (What a refreshing version rather than that mainstream version. She's a poet and knows how to handle her own even with Queen Latifah and Angie Stone. This is one of my party jams, definitely old school.)<br />Think Twice (a nice tribute to Donald Byrd and with Roy Hargrove is a nice groove to drive to too. I just wish it had a better ending.)<br />There you have it folks. Worldwide Underground does not need to be buried at the bottom of the cd rack. It should be listened to withan open mind and remembering that this was how music was &quot;back in the day&quot;! Erykah will be around for a long time to come and gives everyone something to identify with. Let her do her thing and take the ride with her. We will all end up enjoying the trip.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|i just listened to the whole album at Virgin.  I had to wait a 1/2 hour cause the black guy ahead of me was transfixed.  Track after track, this joint's poppin. Usually I can skim through the one or two hits on new albums, this one has about seven hit singles on it. The only weak track is the Moby song (Dude, what's up with that?).  Even Britney's self-penned ballad is good. You go girl!
0553573403|5.0|Book 1 of A Song of Ice and Fire<br />With all the heaps of praise already lavished on this book and the series as a whole, it seems almost silly for me to add my voice to everyone else's.  The reason I am doing so is simply that the book is just that good.  This is the first book of a proposed 6 book series (three have been published, book four is eventually on its way) and is a spectacular start to the series.  George Martin is weaving several different stories to create a larger tapestry and only at the end will we see quite how everything pulls together.<br />The largest story arc in this novel is that of the Starks.  Lord Eddard Stark is Lord of Winterfell in the North.  He is a personal friend of the King and he is an upright and moral man.  He is called down to King's Landing (the capital city) to assist Robert Baratheon as the Hand of the King.  We are introduced the Starks: Lady Catelyn (his wife), Robb (heir), Bran (son), Rickon (youngest son), Sansa (eldest daughter), Arya (daughter), and Jon Snow (illegitimate son).  Even though this is already a large number of characters, each character is important and most of them get chapters from their own viewpoint.  George Martin uses multiple narrators to tell the story.  In Eddard's appointment as Hand, there is a lot of intrigue, some attempted murder, and action.<br />The enemies of the Stark family are the Lannisters.  While the Starks are presented as the protagonists and the heroes, the Lannisters are the villains, but as the novel goes by this is not quite as black and white as it first appears (and becomes less clear still as the series progresses).  The wife of the King is a Lannister, and they seem to be behind a lot of the political intrigue surrounding the King.  Tyrion Lannister, the deformed son, is perhaps the most interesting character of the series and I believe the most well-developed.  He is easily my favorite character out of the many that are presented.<br />If there is not enough ground to cover with the Starks and the Lannisters, we are also introduced to Daenerys, a scion of the former ruling family of the Seven Kingdoms (15 years before, Robert Baratheon led a coup to remove the previous King).  She is in a land far to the East and along with her brother they are trying to find away to go back home and to take back their father's throne from the usurper.  Eventually this will tie into the main conflict between the Starks and the Lannisters.<br />This series (and even this book) is absolutely stunning in scope.  It is a huge story and in this first book we are only feeling out the edges of what the true story is.  There is incredible depth and the story is revealed from the viewpoints of many characters, some of them would not normally be considered a \\"good guy\\", and this only adds to the richness of Westeros.  Simply put, this is one of the best fantasy series that I have read, and this is just the beginning of this deep, deep saga.  Coming in at nearly 800 pages, I didn't want this book to end.  To any fan of fantasy: I cannot recommend this book highly enough.nd to cover with the Starks and the Lannisters, we are also introduced to Daenerys, a scion of the former ruling family of the Seven Kingdoms (15 years before, Robert Baratheon led a coup to remove the previous King).

B00003CX97|5.0|A film by David Lean<br />The Bridge on the River Kwai is based on the fantastic novel by Pierre Boulle.  The movie won 7 out of the 8 Academy Awards it was nominated for, including: Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor (Alec Guinness).  Watching the movie for the first time 45 years later, I'm happy to say that the film still holds up well over time.<br />It is a simple story.  Set during World War II, the Japanese have a prison camp in Southeast Asia.  They have an entire command of British prisoners of war, as well as a couple of Americans.  The commander of the prison, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa, in an Oscar nominated performance) needs to have a bridge built across the River Kwai.  The prisoners are to build it.  This sets up a clash of will between Saito and Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), the officer in charge of the British.  Nicholson still wants to lead his command, despite being in prison.  He allows that the soldiers should work (to build morale, discipline, and to keep in shape), but absolutely forbids his officers to do manual labor.  Saito demands that everyone works.  Both men hold to their own personal code of honor and it is an intense emotional stand off between the two.  While this is happening, the British soldiers are building Saito's bridge.  Nicholson requires that take pride in their work and build the best possible bridge that they can.<br />That is half of the movie.  The other half involves an American POW named Shears (William Holden).  Shears seems to be fairly opportunistic and only out for himself.  He manages to escape from the POW camp and eventually makes his way to freedom.  While free and living at a British military base (waiting until he can return home), he is recruited into a mission to destroy the bridge that Nicholson is building.  The bridge is strategically important and reluctantly Shears agrees.  The storylines are separate for a while, but they do all come together near the end when the bridge is being completed and Shears (with British forces) are arriving to destroy the bridge.<br />This movie is a classic, and there is a very good reason for that.  45 years later (or so), The Bridge on the River Kwai is still a very good movie.  This isn't your typical action movie with explosions every 10 minutes, but David Lean does a good job of building the tension throughout the movie.  It may have some deliberate pacing at times, but if you're a fan of the classic movies, this is one you have to watch.g completed and Shears (with British forces) are arriving to destroy the bridge.  <br />This movie is a classic, and there is a very good reason for that.  45 years later (or so), The Bridge on the River Kwai is still a very good movie.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|For so long the never ending debate of brit being be so inocent OR not has continued... but with her latest album \\"In the zone\\" the question really is not if she is  licentious or an angel, it's about how well did she do in compiling her new music! To appropriately rate this cd, u have to enjoy POP-rock music. To me, I think it would be immature to rate this cd, just because you think she's  licentious OR if your genre/type of music is classical/country/hard metal, etc. I'm not a sole brit fan, but just listen to all her 13 songs, it sure can brighten up your day a bit and even send you dancing, except for some of the balads included which still packs a punch.  Overall, this is a great CD. WORTHY OF BUYING, NOT PIRATING!
B0000025P9|2.0|I rocked out to TOTO IV as a young teenager also.  Man, those tracks &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;Rosanna&quot; were pure singalong joy.  I dug those reviews which lauded the studio guitar wizardry of Steve Lukather, or the pinpoint drumming of what's-his-name.  Obviously these guys were mega-talented musicians.  <br />What gives?<br />Isn't there supposed to be an EDGE on rock 'n' roll?  TOTO IV has no edge.  It's squeaky clean.  Don't play your instruments aggressively, boys.  Don't break a string on that guitar.  Sing pretty.  Cut your hair.  What happened to the rebellion in rock and roll?  Toto lived somewhere in the land between Air Supply, Chicago, late REO Speedwagon, and children's music.  While &quot;Rosanna&quot; and &quot;Africa&quot; were fun tracks when I was 12 or 14 years old, they sound really pathetic now.  <br />I give this album 2 stars simply because it's better than recordings by the likes of Michael W. Smith, Petra, and others of that ilk.  <br />TOTO IV isn't the worst album by TOTO (later releases are actually less spirited and more boring), but it's bad enough.<br />Side note:  &quot;Hold the Line&quot; is a better track than anything on TOTO IV.  It's on the band's eponymous debut, TOTO.  Incidentally, that album is just as bad as TOTO IV.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|After almost 35 years since it was recorded,the Beatles Get Back session spawns another album in Let It Be...Naked.<BR> The difference between it's sister album 1970's Let It Be is the reshuffling of certain tracks,the adding(Don't Let Me Down) and omission of others (Dig It,Maggie Mae),the lack of studio chatter and most importantly,the remixing and total wipe of Phil Spector's overdubbed of the first LIB album.<BR>  At 35 minutes,Other songs and covers from the session could've been included.But the intention is to redo Let It Be as an album that the surviving Beatles have final say on.It may only be for the hardcore fans,but it shows they have passed the audition.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Most heavy metal bands are content to scream, riff, party, and become washed-up, pathetic echoes of themselves (Metallica's St. Anger, anyone?).  Tool was probably the best hard rock group to survive the 1990s, and that's saying a lot.  But for some reason Maynard James Keenan doesn't want to go home -- he'd rather start another band in his spare time, and tour to back it up.  As if Tool, A Perfect Circle, and a song for The Deftones (\\"Passenger\\") weren't enough, rumor has it that Maynard will be starting a project with Trent Reznor entitled Tapeworm.<br />So you'd think the guy would be spreading himself thin.<br />Not so.  Thirteenth Step is a very strong follow-up to Mer de Noms -- but don't expect it to instantly win you over.  This album is less radio-friendly than its predecessor, and it hits hardest by hitting softly first, as opposed to just hitting hard in the first place.  Take \\"The Package\\" or \\"The Noose,\\" for example.  These songs don't come out swinging; rather, they creep you out with their gloom and introspection before the guitars and drums really kick in.<br />But not all of the tracks fit that mold -- APC still know how to have a little fun (\\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\") and write accessible rock songs (\\"Blue\\" and \\"Vanishing\\"), all while staying true to the theme of overcoming addiction.  The only weak spot in the album is the appropriately titled \\"Weak and Powerless\\" -- it lacks the punch we have come to expect from A Perfect Circle, and the chorus feels kind of mindless.<br />If you get the chance to see these guys live, don't let it slip by you -- they will very nearly start a riot in an unassuming arena of mild-mannered goths.  They put on quite a show in Columbus, OH with only two albums of songs to work from, and James Iha even did his best Steve Perry imitation midway through the set by singing his own take on Journey's \\"Don't Stop Believin'.\\"  As a closet Journey fan, I felt vindicated and relieved.

B0000DJZA5|4.0|I just gave it my first listen. It's an interesting fan-fiction CD, sort of like the Yellow Submarine Songtrack (both have stellar sound), but I could have pieced this together from the  original album and the raw tracks on Anthology 3. \\"I Me Mine\\" is still the spector edit. Only 11 tracks?? There are tons of unreleased Get Back session songs. ONE would have been nice. I feel like I've been ripped off a bit. I only give you my money.  But it's a wonderful package and the \\"Fly on the Wall\\" disc makes it worth the price. I think the Glyn Johns version would have more interesting. But maybe now Paul can get over it.  [...]

The end, with Paul wondering where John went, and the sound of fading footsteps, is so sweet and absolutely wonderful.

B000092ZYX|2.0|I really badly wanted to like this one.  I really badly wanted to like Amnesiac too.  Unfortunately, they are both crap, and the sooner we acknowledge this, the sooner we can begin to teach Radiohead that we will not buy such dross.<br />See, the thing is... I LOVED OK Computer.  I LOVED Kid A.  Those two albums are art-prog-rock masterpieces.  Their emotional expressionism and musicianship are almost without peer among rock bands today.  Being the Pink Floyd fan that I am (they are without a doubt the greatest band ever to grace the earth), I found it logical to assume that a band could make not just two great albums, but a string of them, if they loved their art enough.  The Floyd, after all, were the authors of so many classic albums, and though I knew Radiohead could never match such majesty, I at least expected one or two more good albums from them before they crapped out.  Sigh... it was not to be.<br />The wonderful concepts, production, lyrics, and general flair of OKC and KA are not here.  This album is marred by horrible production, convoluted structure (I don't think I've ever heard an album with worse flow), pretentious, meaningless lyrics, and underdevelopment.  Radiohead themselves admit that a large group of these songs were written as far back as the OKC days, and the whole thing was recorded in a matter of weeks.<br />It's so painfully obvious that they ran into a wall after Kid A, and they didn't know where they could go after that.  The album was a career ender, and Yorke should have dissolved the band after that point.  Instead they decide to rehash dead songs and create and album of Radiohead cliches... the drum machines and synthesizers are no longer innovative, Yorke's voice sounds tired and dispassionate and best, downright bitter and frustrated and worst, Greenwood is no longer writing anything groundbreaking on guitar or any other instrument, and Phil Selway's kit sounds like it was miked by hanging a single dictation mic from the ceiling and recording on that.<br />When Roger Waters realized that his band was going nowhere new, and that their creative potential had dimmed as they grew older, he tried to do the right thing and end it.  The legacy was there; there was no need to mar it by continuing on ad infinitum.  Though the rest of the band went on to write subpar music for the next 15 years, at least Roger's will was there.  Radiohead seem not to care about their musical integrity or legacy... in 10 years this album will be seen as either A) a transitory work, if they manage to reignite the flame for another album, or B) a zeitgeist-grabbing disgrace.  I personally believe it to be the latter.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I really enjoyed Britney's new CD. It is very different from her previous albums- more mature, kind of retro.  I love Toxic, Breath On Me and Everytime.  I wish Britney would actually sing though, in more of her songs.  Most of the music is great to dance to, however.  Me Against the Music is good but already overplayed.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|[...] It was true back in 1970 as well, when this was released with Spector's infamous bloating of what was a dead Beatles corpse. What the album proved then, as ill conceived as Spector made it, was that on their worst day, The Beatles were better than everybody. Still are. As Paul and Ringo have recently commented, this is the sound of a band breaking up and friendhsips being tattered. As such, it is in retrospect a lot to bear, and while it is clearly evident that John no longer cared, still in all, for all his reticence about being a Beatle, George played his heart and soul out as did Paul. Ringo sounds mystified by how it is unravelling and that no doubt plays into his emotional references to how \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" impacted him as they played it here, not as how Spector murdered (first of many victims) the extraordinary song.  And how they play it here is as a work in progress. Much has been made of the quality of the songs herein, but in reality, it was clearly documented in the film that John couldn't have cared less. George Martin, in a left handed endorsement of Paul's desire to be listed first on the songs that by this time he was absolutely writing on his own, noted that John often arrived with mere pastiches of songs that George would struggle to hammer into shape, all the while being told how to play his part as his own songs of this period (\\"Isn't It a Pity\\", \\"Let it Roll\\", \\"Beware of Darkness,\\") were rejected by Martin, Lennon and McCartney. It was clearly all of this that led him to blow off at McCartney at Twickenham in the film.  All of that raw energy is simmering close to a boil underneath the surface of these cuts. In may ways it is what makes this CD such an indispensible part of the Beatles oeuvre, and argues most forcefully for destroying the Spector mix.  You'll notice how alive and what a great little band they are both in the studio and on the roof (where is the complete rooftop concert tape?) without the wall of muck contrived bySpector. Harrison's solos are exquisite throughout. McCartney and Ringo display a heightened and refined rhythmic punch whose subtlety has never been equaled. Paul is Dead? More like John was irrelevant. The unspoken proposition here was whether The Beatles could continue as a trio. Perhaps it's best they never resolved that question.   This release is neither of the Glyn John mixes, and so is most accurately Paul and Ringo's take on what was happening. Out of the ashes of this disaster as a band emerged the two defining codas of the Beatles influence: Abbey Road and All Things Must Pass. Like the records of Miles Davis, the Beatles, even at a low ebb, are so much better than everyone else then as well as now.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|The first time I played ToT, namely, well, just after hearing the first couple of songs, I was scared....the DT I knew and loved was gone.  I couldn't say it wasn't what I expected, because I knew they'd continue the direction they took with 6doit, but it still caught me off-guard.  I've always loved the more proggy side of DT rather than the metal side, and this wasn't exactly what I wanted to hear.  But then I listened to it again, and then again, and something clicked.....this was amazing!  It freaking rocks!  I had to force myself to stop expecting Images &amp; Words II and just listen to the CD, and it really opened up to me.  There are some really great songs on here, and yes, when you actually get to the solo parts of the songs, they still sound distinctly like Dream Theater (listen to the solo portion in Endless Sacrifice).  I think this album is really the direction DT wants to take their music, and I don't think they're ever going back to the prog-rock style of Images &amp; Words.  Which, now that I've accepted it, doesn't bother me one bit.

B0000C1733|5.0|A great part of the album is the booklet, as there's commentaties from 3 of the 4 band members, excluding Anthony Kiedis. The song selection is very good, and of course its debatable, I can think of at least 10 songs that didn't make this album that are worthy of being called RHCP greatest hits, but each song is reflective of the identity of the Peppers, a band that just wants to make great music. Each song is also re-mastered, so in other words, Under The Bridge, Give It Away, Soul To Squeeze, Suck My Kiss, and Higher Ground sound much better than their original recordings. We also get 2 new songs (and Soul To Squeeze, previously only available in the Coneheads Soundtrack). This album omits all works from the Chili Peppers' first 3 albums, but the Chili Peppers compliation 'What Hits!?' provides a diverse and complete sampling of the Chili Peppers of the 80s.<br />Possible Additions to this CD include: Aeroplane, Easily, Venice Queen, Can't Stop, Knock Me Down, I Could Have Lied, amongst others. (Personally, I figured Can't Stop, and I Could Have Lied were musts on the album.)<br />Track Listing:<BR>1. Under The Bridge<BR>2. Give It Away<BR>3. Californication<BR>4. Scar Tissue<BR>5. Soul To Squeeze<BR>6. Otherside<BR>7. Suck My Kiss<BR>8. By The Way<BR>9. Parallel Universe<BR>10. Breaking The Girl<BR>11. My Friends<BR>12. Higher Ground<BR>13. Universally Speaking<BR>14. Road Trippin'<BR>15. Fortune Faded<BR>16. Save The Population<br />Fortune Faded is an up-tempo track, originally the #1 single of the 2002 release, though it was not released in favour of By The Way. The song is much like By The Way, a combination of all elements of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, funk, rock, punk, jazz, rap, and a soft feel to it. John Frusciante plays a hypnotic lead guitar, distorted and leaves a haunting effect, allowing Flea and Chad Smith to provide a beat to compliment it. Kiedis speaks usual truths, though I believe at around the 2:45 it would have been appropiate if a solo hadbeen added, but that's just because I have a bias towards Frusciante. <br />Save The Population has a blend of what each individual does the best. Anthony Kiedis sings about a serious matter relating it to metaphor. John Frusciante plays his signature guitar, extremely emotional, colourful, beautiful, and in the chorus providing an acoustic guitar backdrop along with his wonderful back-up vocals. Flea is as good as ever, complimenting Frusciante with his trademark funky bass, slapping that cat for all its worth. Chad Smith, as always, ties it all up with an unspectacular, yet effective and appropiate drum beat. This is one of the best Chili Peppers songs, up there with Californication and Under The Bridge in my eyes for sure.<br />With the inclusion of these two songs amongst the others, we are presented with an incredible album that provides something new for the fans, something old for the fans, all tied together to provide an incredible album for new listeners along with the old fans of the Chilis.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Season 4 is just around the corner, and Season 2 still hasn't made it to DVD?  What's going on here?<br />I'd like to catch up on Seasons 2 &amp; 3 (which I've only seen parts of) before the new season starts!
B00000J7JO|5.0|This album marks the comeback of guitarist John Frusciante, who left the band in 1992 following a build-up of tension between him and frontman Anthony Kiedis, and a lack of motivation to be 'popular' anymore. Californication is the Chili Peppers finest work, combining elements of funk, punk, rock, jazz, and even pop to form a work of art. It is a must have for any fan of music.<BR>Highlights of the album are numerous, as each song has its strengths, the best songs are:<BR>1. Around The World - The Chilis are back...enough said.<BR>2. Parallel Universe - Technically brillant, beautiful solo, and a strong message behind the song.<BR>4. Otherside - Anthony Kiedis pours emotion into the song, with Frusicante and Flea melding their instruments beautifully.<BR>6. Californication - This song is undescribably good. This is RHCP at its finest.<BR>7. Easily - Fun song, with an incredible outro fueled by layered guitars.<BR>11. This Velvet Glove - A homage to Frusciante, beautiful song.<BR>12. Savior - Innovative song, gives the impression of two seperate songs, woven together by the same message, a nice listen.<BR>15. Road Trippin' - This song is beautiful as well, describing the memories of a young Flea, Kiedis, and the deceased Hillel Slovak.<br />This album is so powerful, as the songs are carefully selected and distributed throughout the album. Chad Smith provides a nice medium and backdrop towards the incredible tandem of Frusciante and Flea, today the best guitar-bass duo in Rock. Kiedis is Kiedis, and he needs to be nothing more. Essential.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|this cd is bangin, it has some hot beats, that's why i bought her last cd the beats were off the chain. i think this cd and her last cd were her best ever, now we all know she can't sing, but nowadays, you don't have to have talent to be a star look at J. Lo, can't sing worth a penny.  other than that she is doing her thing.<br />i like MATM, Boom boom, and all the rest of the songs<br />Britney do ya thug thizzle!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|After a long anticipated two years, Britney made a strong comeback with her fourth cd, &quot;In the Zone.&quot;  All of the songs in this cd has an edgier sound bringing out a new Britney.  Unlike her previous cds, this cd is not loaded with pop songs but has a great combinations of pop, hip hop, and dance.  In addition to the different music, Britney's lyrics are more explicit matching the vibrant beats of the music.  This is not like Baby, One More Time or Opps, I Did It Again, or Britney.  This CD is really different.  All of the songs in this CD perfectly fit Britney.  <br />²°°³.¸¸.·°^°.. - - Track Reviews - -.. °^°·.¸¸..²°°³<br />[1] Me Against the Music - This is a great single and featuring Madonna in this song is PERFECT.  This is a great dance track with a great video.  If you wanna get in the zone, give it a listen.  This song is perfect for Britney, the chorus is fast pulling you to the zone.  10/10<br />[2] Breathe on Me - The song is a combination of pop and dance.  This is a perfect song to dance to in the clubs, this will definitely be a hit for Britney.  The lyrics is so raw! One my favorite tracks in the cd.  10/10<br />[3] Showdown - The music in this song is great but the lyrics are not (most repetitive) This song is a combination of pop and hip hop in the making.  It seems like she is singing the chorus over and over again 7.5/10<br />[4] I Got That (Boom Boom) - I Got what?  boom boom?  Britney is actually singing in here unlike Showdown.  Interesting featuring artists.  I think this track will make a great remix.  It needs more polish.  Hip hop track... Real different from her old works... 8.5/10<br />[5] Early Mornin' - Early morning she wakes up?  This track is not pop, it might be hip hop, but in this song, Britney's voice is not mixed - In some parts, she sounds like Pink...  Ok track (will not be a single) 7/10<br />[6] Toxic - This is a perfect song for Britney.  The music for this song is unique and Britney tries to play around with her voice...  Great chorus.  I love this song.  This song is so toxic!  Excellent track with great music.  10+/10<br />[7] Outrageous - This song is outrageous.  This pure hip hop.  Britney is not really singing in this track and its like she is talking... I like this track.  Arabian beats with hip hop.  Unique and different.  Good job...  10/10<br />[8] Touch of My Hand - It starts off sounding like Chinese music, is Britney trying to tell a story.  It is not pop and the lyrics to the song is weird... Something that you can't sing along too.  So so track.  Great courage for trying unique beats.  6/10<br />[9] The Hook Up - Hooking into hip hop.  This track is Britney experiment with Hip Hop.  Not a stand out track but it is a good listen. 7/10<br />[10] Shadow - The second slow song of the cd.  It doesn't sound like Britney, but I like the chorus of the song.  This is not a love ballad or romantic song... Its something different... 8/10<br />[11] Brave New Girl - So so track... I was too excited to get to Everytime so I didn't listen to this track clearly.  <br />[12] Everytime - Wow!  Emotional track.  A mature &quot;Not a girl, Not yet a woman.&quot; Britney sounds so soft... She whispers a lot.  It is a great song with mature lyrics... britney needs more vocal, it would be great if she can expand her voice through this song because it is a beautiful song.  Great way to slow down the dance/pop/hip hop tracks.  I feel her pain through this song.  11/10.  <br />[13] Me Against the Music - Dance dance dance!  Get in the zone. 10/10<br />Standing out tracks: Me Against the Music, Toxic, Outrageous, Breathe on Me, and Everytime.  Give it a listen!<br />If you don't like Britney's old works, get this cd... It shows that Britney made a great change through the years she took up.  If you like her old works... She should also get this cd.  You will not regret...  It is worth it!  Great work Britney...  if you wanna dance, get this cd... it is a nice upbeatcd for the cold winter days!  Get in the zone.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I am an American Beatles purist. So, to me, the REAL Beatles records will always be MEET THE BEATLES, BEATLES '65, HARD DAYS NIGHT, HELP, REVOLVER, RUBBER SOUL, SGT. PEPPER, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, WHITE ALBUM, ABBEY ROAD and LET IT BE. Everything else, including YELLOW SUBMARINE and the several collections of singles Capital slapped together are good--sometimes even great--records, but not the cream of the Beatles crop.<br />That said, I have waited years for LET IT BE...NAKED, even having heard much of it in rough form on a whole series of bootlegs. It's #1 on Amazon this week, and will do about as well on the increasingly meaningless Billboard charts, I'm sure. It's been 33-1/3 years since the band imploded and they still rule the marketplace, but will FM radio play the record? <br />Doubt it. I've always thought much of LET IT BE--&quot;Get Back,&quot; for example--is a unique belnd of Country and Hard Rock, and there is no outlet for that sound in 2003. That's too bad, because it's a great record. <br />It's ironic that it took McCartney and more than three decades to finally release the record Lennon always claimed he wanted released, &quot;warts and all.&quot; That means there is little evidence of the studio sheen the Beatles mastered on PEPPER or ABBEY ROAD, and quite a bit of the rough edge they had in their Hamburg and Cavern days; just what McCartney, at least, had hoped they would rediscover when they were recording the original LET IT BE tapes. <br />McCartney was smart enough to include &quot;Don't Let Me Down,&quot; a great Lennon tune not on the original, and one of the most underrated of all Beatles tunes. While it may not have been thematically correct, I would have liked to have seen &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; and one or two of the other singles relegated to the HEY JUDE LP show up here. The Beatles put out so many great songs between 1964 and 1970 that some real classics have fallen under the Pop world's radar.<br />So, in the end, I think this is afine record. Not a classic Beatles LP, but far better than 99 percent of the tripe currently being called Pop, and a real insight into both McCartney and Lennon's efforts in the Beatles last couple years together (by the way, while LET IT BE was the final true Beatles record released, it was NOT the final Beatles LP recorded. ABBEY ROAD was their final studio effort; it took so long to get Phil Spector to finish his work on LET IT BE, recorded prior to ABBEY ROAD, that LET IT BE was released after ABBEY ROAD and, in fact, after the band dissolved.)<br />So buy LET IT BE...NAKED. It is what the best Rock and Roll/Pop band of all time sounded like on their lesser days, warts and all: Better Than Anybody Else.
0385120508|1.0|I got _A Woman of Substance_ from the library, hoping it would entertain me for a day or so. It was so bad I skipped the middle half and just read the last chapter. Horribly cliched writing, unidimensional characters. I don't usually write reviews, but I was so annoyed to see the 5-star rating, I had to. Sorry!
B0000DJE9R|4.0|This compilation is well worth the price and a must-have for anyone who's a fan of Jackson's music.... The 'Thriller' album was amazing, and after buying it on CD I didn't intend to buy a greatest hits type compilation but the songs on this one are so good.
B00008OE4W|4.0|This film is an example of what an ensemble cast of A-list actors can do when they have fun with a project. While their acting has been better in other films, their camaraderie carries the film. Clocking in at over 2 hours, the film becomes muddled in parts, but your interest in the characters keeps you from becoming overly impatient with it. Equal parts \\"Charade\\" and \\"WarGames\\" the movie keeps you guessing at who's who and what the character's true motivations are, while the technology doesn't get out of hand (most solutions are low- not high-tech).<br />For a Collector's Edition, the supplementary material on the DVD is disappointing. The high point is the commentary: the detailed reminiscences of the director and writers are informative and enjoyable. The \\"Making of\\" documentary is pleasant, but doesn't build much on the commentary; the comments of the cast don't expand beyond telling who the characters are (only Ackroyd describes anything he brought to his character beyond the writers' amalgam of 70s and 80s phone phreaks and social engineers). The single theatrical preview is nice, but with along with the bonus materials in general, you feel there should have been more. The only other item on the Bonus Materials section is a \\"Recommendation\\" for \\"other films you might enjoy\\": Field of Dreams (same director/writer), Spy Game (also with Redford), and The Sting (Redford again, with James Earl Jones' father); there aren't previews of these films, just three small DVD cases sharing the screen. No deleted scenes (although several are described in the commentary). No outtakes (you know there had to be some serious hijinks on the set). No scripts or scene comparisons to show the film's decade-long evolution. Not even an Easter egg to reward devoted hackers.<br />Buy this disc for the movie, not the bonus materials. It's a lot of fun and the cast is a \\"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon\\" player's dream.
B000002UKS|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST FOO FIGHTERS ALBUM. I ALWAYS ENJOY LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM DESPITE BEING MORE OF A FAN OF HEAVY METAL. THIS IS WORTH BUYING NO MATTER WHAT MUSIC U LIKE AS LONG AS U EVEN REMOTELY LIKE ROCK. HEY!JONNY PARK IS A MASTER PEICE, ALONG WITH EVERLONG, NEW WAY HOME(BRILLIANT ENDING TO THE ALBUM). SO BASICALLY AN ACE ALBUM.BUY IY!!!
B00005JM0B|4.0|Leaving the theatre after the end of the first showing of T3 everyone was looking at each other sort of grimly.  Don't want to spoil it, but don't expect a happy, fluffy, thumbs up as the t101 goes into the molten metal.  Picking up where the second left off, the machines are trying to kill John Conner again, and while they're at it, eliminate some of his cabinet members from the future.  The new evil Terminatrix is the logical progression from the amorphous T1000 prototype from the second film.  I thought the actress playing the TX did a nice job walking the line between tough as nails ice queen and sexy in spite of herself-robotness.  I remember reading once after T2 that they compared Arnold to the T1000 as a tank to a Porsche, the comparison holds true here as well.  With her hair pulled back, she is sleek and dangerous in the same way Patrick was..  I actually liked this one more than T2, it wasn't as self-referentially funny.  There are moments of comedy, but they are tempered by the ominous situation facing the heroes, more than the second film. Could also be that we don't have to deal with the whining preen of Edward Furlong from back then.  The action and chase scenes are impressive and seem less CG-ish than the freeway chase in Matrix II [although that sequence still is unsurpassed in my opinion].  Overall, there is really is no down time lull that doesn't work, the quiet moments are handled well with Conner and soon to be more Claire Danes [sp] &lt;who also did a bang up job>].  Arnold was Arnold, some of the new quips had us laughing, `Talk to da hand'.  The DVD contains numerous extras but notably hilarious section on principals of the Terminator universe where they don't use the original actors from T1, T2 and have them running out of focus or Photoshop art effected.  There are two audio commentaries, one done with the three actors, and then one by the directory.  Upon repeated viewings I think it held up well as the third member of the franchise.  Recommended.ended.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is truly the BEST BRITNEY SPEARS album ever. Its great she wrote alot of the songs. You can tell that she really put her HEART + SOUL into it. It is the besst. Great for NEW BRITNEY FANS. If you are a regular BRITNEY fan (like myself) you will LOVE this album. Its a must have for any true BRITNEY fan. It is an example of awesome work, thought, effort, and relating issues to issues teens face ever BUY THIS ALBUM TODAY AND EXPERINCE THE MAGIC
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears has grown up, and she makes it abundantly clear in this full listen ablum that is really the first to not hold back. she is not afraid of sexuality, even if at times her idea of sex is a bit commercial. \\"In the Zone showcases Britney as she is today, and for once i actually believe she has something to say.<BR>surprisingly, \\"Me Against The Music\\" is not the best, or close to the best song on the album, which is strange seeing as it was the first single (it had been planned to be the first single long before madonna helped with it, which rules out any outside influance from the former queen of pop). Just the same, it opens the album up quite nicly, and is amazingly catchy. <BR>songs like \\"(i got that) Boom Boom,\\" \\"Breath on Me,\\" and \\"Toxic,\\" are the well produced and well rounded singles, but nothing can compare to the beauty of Britney's new song (self written musicaly and vocally), \\"Everytime.\\" The ballad is the most mature piece of pop music out there, beating Christina's oversung \\"Beautiful\\" with a soft approach and a vocal range that challanges her.<BR>She also starts to take some risks with her new controversial song \\"Touch of My Hand which is about self indulgance, but vocally, she is not pushing herself. she proved two years ago on staurday night live that she could sing when she performed two songs with no back track and recieved a 3 minute standing ovation, cut off by comercials for \\"Everytime\\" just last month. the girl can sing, but she seems to choose not to. She may be no Christina or Whitney, but she could at least try, and its not evident that she does through most of the album.<BR>I give this album four stars, becuase this album is truely a wonderful listen. it's the end of a four album legacy about growing up, and wheather Britney realizes it or not, she has created a audio diray about the changes of growing up, and she has so many possibilities for the future that its rediculus. but it looses a star in the lack of challenge. she doesn't try as hard as she could, and it shows through her music.<BR>For those who hate Britney, thats just to bad, becuase she has never judged you. just give this album a listen, and maybe you might understand where she is coming from, for Britney is real person, and it finnally shows through her music.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Ok, I'll admit that I am a 22 year old closet Britney fan.  Her music is typically &quot;upbeat dance at the club&quot; music.  And while I enjoy &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; and &quot;Toxic,&quot; I can't say much for the other dance tracks.  I do enjoy the ballad &quot;Everytime,&quot; but there is little I can say that is positive about this album.  Britney is still great as a person, but her attempt to transition her music isn't as successful as her former beau Justin Timberlake's.  Hopefully this album is not her final transition as far as her music goes.<br />:)  Gretchen
B00005JMFR|4.0|The Matrix Revolutions offers a satisfying ending to the Matrix Trilogy.  While some of the charcters and story aspects in the film could have used a little more development, the theology of the film, including the ending, is rock solid.  The battle scene in Zion and the fight between Neo and Smith are outstanding.  If you've seen the first two, you should see the third.  Revolutions is a great film.
B00005JM0B|5.0|Brilliance has its degrees.  There is four year old finger painting brilliance.  Then there is Arnold brilliance.  That's all you need to know.  Third installment in a worn franchise, right?  Missed it in the theater?  Holy cow, my friend.  What a mistake that was!<br />This movie was clearly written by a 12 year old when fun was fun.  There aren't any ninjas kindly waiting their turn in this movie.  It is non-stop unbelievable action.  You will premanently press your silouette into your leather sofa, it's that good.  I couldn't recover from scene to scene.  It's just unbelievable action in the all out story-telling of a kid who doesn't consider if the scene is practical.  \\"Wouldn't it be cool if...\\"  \\"Yeah yeah, and then, while the car is sliding...\\"  \\"And the crane will be...\\"  Someone in Hollywood finally found scripting talent for action movies.<br />Sure, it's a stupid premise.  \\"Spot the plot hole\\" is for idiots in this flick.  I'm sure some wickedly smart person has already disproven that skin can't survive without an intricate circulatory system, yet the terminator clearly doesn't have a heart.  But to this friend, I say, go get a life or go watch Wizard of Oz with your mom!  <br />This is Arnold!  This guy is governor.  And I voted for him!  Man, just seeing him stand next to Gray Davis makes me chuckle.  I wonder if Gray is like \\"Whoa.  I look like a cocktail shrimp!\\"<br />Ah anyway, seriously, this movie has a lot of the action grit of the first one.  Some scenes are campy.  Others are comic book like as the trend has gone in the past decade.  It's not to be missed if you are a fan of the franchise.  I would rank it the best of the three.<br />The ONLY negative (besides California in general) is that the DVD doesn't have more Kristanna Loken on it.  She gave a terrific performance, much better than Nick Stahl's detached acting and Kate Brewster's girly overacting.  I wonder if Arnold tried to grab anyone's butt.  Ah, anyway, in the true American way, ignoring anything west of the Pacific, east of the Atlantic, south of the border, and those weird nobodies up north, one of the true great evils of the world is that Loken got perhaps fifth billing.  She is a cutie.  She got almost no time in the DVD extras.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney started an evolution, and that's pretty flattering for brit's fans... I am a fan of electronic music and britney just knew how to incorporate it on her new album, that's just great. Early Mornin' is one of the best tracks of the album, as well as MATM...<BR>I know non-brit's fans are going to be exceptical about her new release, but you're going to be impressed... get it now!!
B000006OS2|1.0|Goodtimes video has butchered this great movie.  Sometimes the person talking is not in focus or even on the screen.  Some scenes are missing.  I can't take it back for mine was a gift.  Make sure you buy the version authorized by the Wayne estate if you want the real movie with all of the scenes included.  I have that copy on VHS.  Sorry to say I have not yet found it on DVD.
0066214122|2.0|Well, although I usually enjoy Michael Crichton's books (not to mention ER and his movies), this one is definitely not his best work. Full of cutesy &quot;Mr. Mom&quot;-type scenes and dialogs of the male protagonist, but devoid of characters you might actually care about, the plot moves along through its Jurassic Park paces, towards the inevitable happy ending. I just found it boring.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|this is honestly the best CD i have ever bought in my life and my Cd collection is really big just trust me on that one. This cd will make you get up and dance i can guarantee it. It has awesome beats great bass, new style that Britney has brought to perfection with this piece of work. I mean, shes not singing in most of the songs, just pretty much breathily whispers the lyrics but it really works for her and what she is tryign to achieve here! Just great i would reccomned it to people who have lots of parties like me beacuse your guests will never be bored! you wont regret buying this CD!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Let it Be has finally been reworked into a more fitting coda to the Beatles world changing musical career. Phil Spector's after the fact overdubs have been removed to reveal the true sound of this fantastic recorded work.
6302227534|4.0|This movie had some of the most amazing special effects I have ever seen and a really relentless and nasty terminator to boot!<br />If you get by the flawed premise of the story's beginning (that another more advanced terminator and a terminator protecter were sent back, even though we were told in the first film that the grid was smashed after John Connor went through) we have a great heart-pounding action film.  Not quite as good as the first film (otherwise I would have rated it a 5) but still one of the best action flicks available on video.  Spawned the line, Hasta la vista, baby.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|The new Britney Spears CD is okay. It has a very Kylie Minouge meets Madonna meets strip joint feel to it. Some of the tracks are good such as Boom Boom, Breathe on Me, Toxic, and Outragous. On some of her songs she just seems like she is going through the motions trying to sound sexy and mature. She has also played to her strengths which isn't singing. The CD is okay but wait to buy it when it is $5 not at $15.
B00005NKW3|5.0|One of my favorite holiday films of all time.  Especially, since I worked in Macy's the first time I saw it and was very familiar with a lot of the interior scenes including the employee locker area.<br />The scene where the judge is buried by the Santa mail is priceless!  Hard to believe that the girl was a young Natalie Wood.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|It's amazing to me that you can pick up an AC/DC concert video on DVD in full 5.1 surround sound for about half the price that the original VHS version sold for in 1992.  All hail the DVD format!<br />Of the three major AC/DC concert videos released on DVD so far (Stiff Upper Lip Live, No Bull, and this one), Live At Donnington to me is the best, if only for the superior setlist.  The only one of AC/DC's major hits missing is \\"Who Made Who\\" (it's available on the CD version, \\"AC/DC Live\\").  This concert DVD also marks the one and only tour where drummer Chris Slade was in the band.  He was later replaced by original drummer Phil Rudd.  Nothing against Mr. Rudd (hard to mess with the original), but Slade is a much more charismatic individual and one heck of a drummer to boot.  His bald head and the gleeful look on his face as he bashes the crap out of his drums gives the band a third strong visual persence (right after the omnipresent Angus Young and Brian Johnson) that only adds to the band's appeal.
B00000F5PI|5.0|Everyone who sees this film falls in love with Raymond (isn't that where they came up with the idea for the name of the tv show?), who Tom Cruise used to call Rain Main.  An autistic with a genius for numbers, Raymond is used by Cruise (the ultimate con-man), who in the end realizes that his often ignored brother is more important than his schemes.<br />With the memorable lines, I got my underwear from KMart and I'm an excellent driver, this movie will touch you and give you a deep appreciation of people who are different.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|The Matrix is already a very simple movie, built on an interesting idea, which is the question of perception x reality. The rest of it is pretty bad: machines dominating the world, a messianic approach to freedom; &quot;the one&quot;, all these platitudes ruin the idea and the rythm of the movie, which was good untill neo wakes up. Anyway, the Matrix Reloaded goes beyond the platitudes and enters the dangerous ground of confusion. The story spirals and gets quite complicated. You don't understand who is who anymore and all of it comes, from time to time, wrapped in some sort of philosophical weird meditation.<br />Anyway: nobody explains why all these guys dress in rags, and why, if there is an Oracle, there is no Microsoft.
B000053V9F|5.0|Stone has created a masterpiece.  The monologue of Donald Sutherland and the scene where Costner explains how he believes JFK was shot make this movie one of the most memorable that I have ever seen.<br />The only problem with this film is that the viewer is not sure if everything that is presented as fact, really is fact and not the invention of Stone for dramatic affect.
B0000A36J5|5.0|Yes, actually several scenes were reworked and reshot. So even though the final length of the movie is not 40 minutes longer than the original there are 40 minutes worth of new footage. If this was confusing move to Florida...
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I have to say that this album truly expresses who Britney Spears has become over the years. She may not have a voice like Aretha Franklin or Sarah McLachlan, but there is a certain \\"something\\" within each of the songs to make them work for her. The songs on this album are by far more emotive than ever, and I feel they captivate who she is as an individual: sexy, independent, and vulnerable. However, some of the songs are more mature in subject matter, so I have a feeling she may lose some of her fan base and gain a more mature audience...whch is a plus for her I think. My favorite tracks on this album are \\"Showdown,\\" \\"Breathe on Me,\\" and \\"Everytime.\\" I absolutely love \\"Everytime,\\" it is just such a beautiful song with a lot of emotion...this has to be my favorite by far. I like the new Britney. She doesn't seem as superficial...I think her fans will appreciate her more because of this. Good Job Britney!
B00008R9KF|5.0|I've seen few films with such intensity, humour and heartache all rolled into one.  The scenes flowed onto each other seamlessly, the plot complex yet perfectly led, and the Acting was just superb.<br />Daniel Day Lewis was unforgettable as the rough street punk Johnny, while Gordon Warnecke was equally engaging as Omar, the Pakistani boy with big ambitions.  Another stand-out was Roshan Seth, playing a drunken disgruntled Pakistani father, with no hope, no future, and little life left in his alcohol weakened body.  Seth stole the scene wherever he appeared, and not just because of the hair, seriously.<br />The fact that this film is partly about the relationship between two men had absolutely no influence on me as an audience.  To the people watching, it is as natural to them as it is for the two main characters on the silver screen.  <br />At times, it is heartbreaking to watch the hatred and misunderstanding between two races living on the same land.  But what do 2 boys with a beautiful laundrette care anyway, for them, each day is a brand new day isn't it?
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I literally Loved every single song on this album! I honestly, lyricly and vocally wouldent have know this was Britters!  It's such a vibey, sensual, amazing album! Congratulations Britney on an amazing accomplishment!
B0000584V3|5.0|If you don't know what kind of music Opeth plays, this is the perfect album for you. Blackwater Park has lots of &quot;clean&quot; vocals on it, so, if you don't like Death Metal growls you still be OK with BWP.<BR>The guitar riffs are always complex and fit just right, these guys compose very nice, evoking passages and crushing riffs.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Much better than her last album, but still lacking. The best song is the Madonna duet, though we could have stood to hear more Madonna and less Britney. But really I must know, what is The Zone and why is she so desperate to get into it???
B000002V0Q|4.0|Countdown To Extinction is a good album, with great guitars, more &quot;elaborated&quot; solos and some great lyrics. But it's not like any other Megadeth album, it's more &quot;experimental&quot; and commercial. Here you'll find shorter and slower songs, great guitar solos and rythm changes. So, if you're seeking for something like Rust In Peace, you'll probably end a little bit dissapointed with this one.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|I'm sure Whitney &amp; Bobby will have enough blow and coke laying around for a real &quot;White Christmas.&quot; &quot;Let It Snow&quot; should also be great with flurries up her nose. The cover art is the funniest by far, how t0ked was she?
B0000C7PQK|3.0|I have to admit that it took me several listens before I actually liked this CD. At first I was disappointed, there seemed to be lacking any of the &quot;special hooks&quot; that the previous albums possessed.  But, then I realized that this may be the hook of this album. It is much more club friendly than the other albums. I can almost hear &quot;Boum Boum&quot; and &quot;The Look of Today&quot; being played in the clubs (just add some club bass beats and some techno flourishes).  As I listen more carefully to the rest of the album, I realize that there are still some interesting sounds and lyrics.<BR>I am willing to go on the ride with Enigma...change is good.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I love this film so much and the Extended Edition does not disappoint. Great interviews with Christopher Lee and Viggo Mortensen on the 'History of Middle Earth' featurette as well as the creation of Gollem. LOOK'S LIKE MEAT IS BACK ON THE MENU, BOYS!
B0000C9V3T|3.0|The song selection here is icredibly vaired, from classic rock, to country/western--even Zamfir's flute makes an appearance.  Having such a mized bag makes the CD a hit and miss prospect.  I find myself skipping through most of the middle tracks--not a good sign.  My favorite tracks are currently 1,2, and 9 (an odd bunch, if you've listened to the CD.)<br />I always enjoy trarntino's choice of music to place in his movies.  He has a knack for putting the right song in the right spot.  If you enjoyed Kill Bill (and I did) you'll like the soundtrack.  I voted in so-so, manly because i was hoping for a soundtrack playable all the way through with no filler, like the Pulp Fiction soundtrack. 'Tis my own high expectations that doom this CD.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I still get goosbumps thinking about this movie. I saw it over 3 years ago and every time I see it or hear or read about it, I still get that Oh-what-a-great-movie-that-was feeling....and goosebumps.  This is a must see, trust me.  Watch it then judge it yourself. Oh and watch it in Italian...it's a LITTLE better. Before you know it, you will be writing your own review and recommending it. DEFENITLY a 5 star movie. PEACE
0345440900|2.0|I bought this book because I was having some sleepless nights and hoped to find the magic solution.  Well, if I've learned anything from reading parenting books, it's that there is no one right way to parent.  Everyone has a different theory, you can find a theory out there to support just about any parenting style out there.<br />At the outset, I thought this book was going to be great.  I heard wonderful things about it, the author begins by telling you she's going to help you get better connected with your baby and really understand your baby.<br />Then as I started to get into the meat of the book, I realized I was starting to have a bit of an anxiety attack because she made me feel like just about everything I was doing to get my baby to sleep was WRONG.  Rocking is bad.  Napping a swing or bouncy chair is bad.  Co-sleeping is bad.  I was doing every one of these things - this is how we got sleep in our household!<br />As soon as I started feeling stress from reading this book, I put it down and vowed never to let any parenting &quot;expert&quot; out there make me feel like I was doing a poor job.  Some of what I do, I do because it feels right.  Yes, my son slept on my husband or my chest the first few weeks.  You know what, I LOVED it and I treasure that experience.  My son no longer sleeps on our chests.  He needed the closeness when he was a newborn. <BR>We co-sleep and yes, it's not for everyone, but it works for us.  <br />I've come to the conclusion that I just disagree with any parenting &quot;expert&quot; out there who tries to advocate making a newborn &quot;independent.&quot;  If babies were meant to be so independent, they should come out walking &amp; talking &amp; able to feed themselves.  Until they're ready to become independent, they NEED us.  It may be inconvenient to some, but that's parenthood!  When I feel like I'm losing confidence in my parenting skills, I will turn to Dr. Sears, who I think advocates a parenting style very much in line with what I feel is &quot;right.&quot;
B000000HTM|4.0|No response is really needed for this review. I agree with just about all the 4 &amp; 5 star reviews you all left, but I wanted to share a little known fact with use all. First, I have put off buying this CD thinking I was nuts not seeing &quot;Theme One&quot; listed in the credits. [I thought I had the wrong record up on the web page] But I DO have the U.S. LP released all those years ago [bought it when it came out] &amp; it's a little scratched up so I was gonna buy the CD - but alas - no &quot;Theme One&quot; is listed on Amazon's page. Thanx to all the reviewers for enlightening me to the elimination of this gem on the CD. The &quot;Little known fact&quot; [I just love stretching a story] was that &quot;Theme One&quot; which IS a killer track, was written by none other than the fab 4's George Martin and was originally released on his [way ancient] &quot;London By George&quot; LP. Notice his credit under the song on the P.H. U.S. label. Why WAS this song omitted ? ? I do not know, but their decision to leave it off sucks.  Anyway, I promise this is a &quot;true fact' and that's about it for me this time. Thanx for your indulgence.  Peace
0385504209|5.0|Do you like: thrillers, puzzles, conspiracy theories, art, history, explorations of religious theories, or just plain fun reads?  If you answer yes to even one of the above, then I recommend this book!<br />I completely enjoyed this book and am looking forward to re-reading it so that I can focus on the iconography and symbols more fully.  Unlike most mystery/thriller books, this one is more than just a fun ride - it challenges you to think on many different levels.  Even the 'heroes' and 'villans' aren't easy and clear-cut but multi-dimensional people who are working from deeply and passionately held beliefs.<br />As for where the lines of truth and fiction lie?  I'm still working that out for myself... which I think is the point.
0062515675|3.0|The book is well written. When Julian Mantle suffers a heart attack, he goes to India to learn from some wise Buddhist men over there.<br />There are other books that talk about eastern philosophy that are much better than this one, because they concentrate on that philosophy and their principles.<br />The techniques described here are not new at all. But if you are new to Buddhism and eastern philosophy, then this book should be ok for a start. And of course, the book views eastern philosophy from a western point of view (which some of you may like).<br />The main part of the book is when Julian Mantle comes back of India and sees an old friend, and then Julian starts to explain all the wisdom that he learned in India.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD displays a much more mature, self-aware Britney Spears. This by far is her BEST work up to date. The tracks are so unqiue, they are a combination of dance/pop/R&amp;B. You'll be hooked on it the minute it starts playing.!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I have just picked up this CD and all that I can say is &quot;WOW!&quot;<BR>Miss. Whitney put so much effort into this album and sounds like she is getting her life back together. And the voice..Oh my gosh it is better than ever!! This is so much better than her previous album, Just Whitney and even certain tracks on My Love Is Your Love. This is truly and album that EVERYONE will love for the holiday season. A must-buy!!!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|OK, I'll admit it; I was EXTREMELY skeptical of this release...for many reasons.  First, where the bleep is the movie Let It Be?  Second, where's the original Get Back album?  Only 11 songs???<br />Blah, blah, blah...AND...it wasn't even going to be released in SACD hybird.<br />So, I was prepared NOT to like this...but now I understand what the point is - to present the best material from those sessions in their finest possible light.  And, in short, it succeeds in spades.  While the sound does not leave you awestruck, it is much improved over the orignal Let It Be CD.  And ...Naked is not exactly true.  Yep, the Spector stuff has been stripped away, but the vocal overdubs have not...much to the enhancement of the songs.  The most sterling difference is with Let It Be and The Long and Winding Road, with Billy Preston's keyboards now to the fore and a fine alternate guitar solo by George on Let It Be.  And amazingly, the strings aren't missed at all on Across the Universe.  That was one song I actually liked Spector's overdubs on, but it now shines even brighter.  For a song that was originally unreleased, we now have four versions to listen to (Let It Be, Past Masters, Vol. 2, Anthology 3 and now Let It Be...Naked)!  Phil Spector didn't much mess with the rest of the songs, and about all you can say is the the mix and/or take is different...and, for the most part, much better.  Get Back sounds a bit odd lacking either the false ending or the spliced-in Lennon tid-bit (We'd like to thank you on behalf of...), but SOUNDS great, as does Don't Let Me Down.  The rockers are in your face, and Two of Us is even more beautiful.<br />I could go on, but there's no need.  This CD totally dispells the belief that these songs and performances needed touch-up by Phil Spector or anyone.  All they really needed was the ability to choose the right take (or takes), and mix them with some class and punch.  I was never as critical of Spector's post-mortum as many were, but this blowsthe original Let It Be right out of the water.  This is now a proper Beatles album, just the songs, no snippets, jams or throwaways to get in the way.  <br />And as such, it ranks right up there with the best of them.  So, in the end, I'm glad they didn't Let It Be.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|.......that Dream Theater did an album like this. See, to me, DT have always straddled the line between flat out awesome and well.... &quot;wimpy&quot;. I do like all of their albums, but they have never been one of my favorites because of this. Thankfully, DT have finally embraced the metallic aspects of their sound and they have created their best album yet. For one thing, don't listen to the people that say this album has no emotion or the ones that compare it to Linkin Park or Godsmack because it's a full-on metal album. Thats absurd. These people know absolutely nothing about metal, first of all the above mentioned bands are NOT metal in any way, shape, or form. And to say there is no emotion.... thats another thing that people don't know about metal. Metal is one of the most intense and gripping forms of music. It is both agressive, tense, and all uplifting in ways. Thankfully DT decided to drop their &quot;wimpy&quot; aspects (and no typical DT ballads, thank god) and create an original, emotionally and musically intense piece of work here. Highly recommended, especially for people who have never been the biggest DT fans.
B00000I8UE|5.0|Everyone has been there.  You're minding your business, relaxing to some music, and it feels so good, sounds so incredible that you have to knit your brows, close your eyes, shake your head and say, &quot;Mmm, mmm, mmm!&quot;  That is the Traveling Miles experience.<br />I would never attempt a tribute to Miles Davis.  Before I listened to this album, I thought it couldn't be done.  But Cassandra Wilson is the quintessential Jazz singer, and Traveling Miles is an undeniable triumph.  <br />On Traveling Miles, Ms. Wilson goes from soft and sultry, to stanky and funky, to beautiful and bluesy.  (I am a huge fan, does it show?)<br />Having never heard of Cassandra Wilson before, I bought Traveling Miles and New Moon Daughter at the same time because of how impressed I was in the record store with a track from New Moon Daughter.  The next week I went back and bought every album I could find with Ms. Wilson's name on it.<br />Cassandra Wilson's albums vary in style and mood, but all showcase her deep, rich voice, and the outstanding musicianship of her accompanists.  Traveling Miles is no exception.  You will LOVE this CD, and you should give her other stuff a listen too.  Her sound is always evolving, and she has something for everyone.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble is phenomenal, his style of music reaches all ages from the very young to teens to young adults, 30 somethings to the golden age and beyond.  It's a must own to anyone and everyone.  Great Job!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Even I, as a Britney fan, was not really looking forward to this cd when I heard it was going to have a lot of techno-influences, etc. but I must admit that this is her best album to date. It all starts with the catchy &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;, which features Britney's long-time idol Madonna. Then with songs like &quot;Outrageous&quot;, &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom&quot;, and &quot;The Hook Up&quot;, you get to hear a more R&amp;B sound that most wouldn't expect from a Britney Spears album. Her ballad &quot;Everytime&quot;, which she penned herself, is by far her best ballad out of all of her albums. I really strongly recommend this cd to anyone who just wants to fun and get lost in a zone.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Dream Theater's done it again.  &quot;Train of Thought&quot; is heavier than anything they've produced, and although that has turned off some, it takes nothing away from the brilliance of each musician's talent.  The vocals are perfect for Labrie's range and Portnoy (drums) and Petrucci (guitar) are absolutely amazing.  A must buy for any prog-rock fan.  After all, Dream Theater is still king of prog-rock.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Poor Britney. No matter what she does, she's not going to get any respect from the critics. But In The Zone is as good as contemporary pop gets - it's fun, sexy, danceable and mature. Her voice is not a great instrument, but neither is Madonna's. What she is is expressive, sensual and energetic - she makes you feel what she wants you to feel. She had some great producers on this album, and it shows. It's probably a four star album, but I give Britney the extra star because I know she's going to take so many unfair shots from the haters. Which is too bad, because she's adorable and talented.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this cd when it first came out and was blown away by the songs and Norah's voice. I will listen to any type of music at least once--forget the labels, if it's good music, it's good music, that's just how it is. What first caught my attention were the lyrics to the songs. I love good lyrics, and the wonderful music just adds to the allure of this cd. There is a reason why Norah won eight Grammys for this cd, after all. The slow ballads and the slightly upbeat ones, all are terrifc. I'd also recommend buying the imported cds, such as the one from Japan; they have songs such as &quot;Ruler of My Heart&quot; and &quot;Peace,&quot; which aren't on the American version. <BR>I'm hoping for more from Norah in the near future.
B0000AUHQF|4.0|I was waiting for a true deluxe edition that has a commentary of the making of the movie.  Most of the time I won't buy a DVD unless it has a commentary on the movie. This is one of my all time favorite movie and what made me love Sean Astin as an actor. If you are looking for an inspirational, uplifting movie for you or someone else, this is it.  I give the movie 5 stars but this DVD edition 4 stars.
B0000CFW87|5.0|&quot;Closer&quot; is truly a magnificent cd. Josh's voice is phenomenal--one can only imagine what he sounds like in concert. (I have yet a chance to hear him live.) The first listen was good, and the following ones better. Granted, this cd didn't seem as good as his first in the beginning, but now I've taken to singing the lyrics, Italian and all. <BR>You Raise Me Up is admittedly a very good song, with a melody that sticks, but gets tiring after a while. Oceano was lovely, as was All'improvviso amore and Per te. It was interesting to listen to Josh singing in French on track number 11, Hymne a l'amour, and Joshua Bell did a wonderful job on the violin in Mi Mancherai.<BR>I would recommend this cd, for in its entirety, it's spectacular. Well done Josh!
B00008977N|5.0|I had not witnessed Peter Gabriel live until I saw this dvd at a friends house.I purchased it the next day.My 5 and 8 year old kids are asking me when we can go to see him live.Truly,a performer second to none!People who criticize picture quality and integrity of this live performance,in my opinion ,are a little misguided.I buy concert dvd's to be entertained ,and if that means touching up to enhance the listeners enjoyment,so be it.PG admits to the sonic enhancements,and to my ears,the touch ups are minimal.I have a very nice system to play this on and I can tell you that,of the 20 or so concerts that I own ,this is top 3 for sound and number 1 for performance.The dts track has beautiful separation,is rich and immersive.For those who question a lack of bottom end,you need new equipment.Forward to digging in the dirt and hold on to the couch.Picture quality is ok,but wasn't on the radar until I read the reviews here.A great concert from a great artist.5 stars!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I am listening to the cd right now and I really love the sounds. Last cd, people said it was the most mature but the songs like Cinderella and others are nothing but pop. This cd is the mature Britney. She is grown up and making good music. No, its not the best but for her-its great. The song Everytime is great. People need to realize she is Britney Spears and not a songwriting genious but this is a good cd. Good job Britney!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Ummmm I was forced by a relative of mine to go to the record release party for this atrocity of a &quot;singer&quot; and I'll tell you this album is pretty bad. The PR tried to give me a copy but after hearing it on the speakers overhead. I told her no thank you. I mean what is up with this girl she is trying so hard to be cool and she's not. Why do record companies invest so much time,money and energy in promoting such a bad singer and brainwashing the populus?...how exhausting this must be for them. Wouldn't it just be easier to sign a girl who can ACTUALLY SING,has a modicum of decorum and some class to boot. But humans like to do things the hard way I guess. One thing I have to say one of the songs Toxic was pretty cool but I would have much rather heard Kylie Minogue or jewel sing it...granted theyre not the greatest singers in the world but at least they have pitch and some class. My recommendation if you like her then go for it...but basically its a frivilous waste of ear space.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|In many movies that have extensive special effects (mostly sci fi movies), anyone can question whether the SF are there to enhance the art of movie making, or whether the movie is there to showcase the art of SF. In George Liucas' &quot;Start Wars&quot; films, the latter is correct, while in Peter Jackson's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, the former is.<br />The original Matrix film also belonged to the former. I feel that many other viewers, like me, were expecting Matrix Reloaded to be more of the same. If so - we were all sorely disappointed. There are some new ideas and plot twists, and some cheesy philosophy about choices and understanding our motives for making them (therefore I give this movie 2 stars), but it is almost hidden behind too much SF and too many over elaborate fight scenes. Granted, this had also existed in the first Matrix. Why am I objecting now? Lets take the fight scenes, for instance. In the first movie, they came to demonstrate to ability to bend rules we thought were un - bendable. Making lots of copies of Agent Smith fight Neo seemed to have little point but the show the movie makers' ability to create this sort of scene.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Alot of people that wrote a review to this thought godsmack still sounds the same.Aceally this album is simuler to there self-titaled,and Awake.I think Sully sings alot more then on the past two albums.I think the sollo's are a little better.I like all of there album's eather way thou.If your a godsmack fan I recomand that you add this to your collection!
B00005JLYW|5.0|The Charlie's Angels series of movies improves greatly with this second one.  The action has been powered up, the story is more interesting, and the humor works a little better.  In other words, the whole thing has been put on overdrive.  One of the big changes is that Bill Murray has been replaced with Bernie Mac as Bosley.  I love Bill Murray's comedy, but he didn't fit in well with the first Angels movie, so I think this is an improvement.  Another thing is the use of wire action and CG has increased to good effect.  Also, Tom Green is absent from this movie (thank goodness).<br />The Angels are played by Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu.  I particularly enjoyed Cameron Diaz's performance.  Her portrayal of Natalie added a lot of energy and freshness to the movie.  Without her performance, I would probably drop the rating.  I just can't say it enough--Cameron is a great actress.<br />The basic plot of this sexy comic action movie is that two rings have been stolen from the government.  When the two rings are combined, they release the identity and location of everyone on the witness protection program.  The Angels must stop the shadowy figure who is threatening to sell these rings to the highest bidder.<br />One of the scenes that was a stand-out for me was the one at a motorcross rally.  Several dirt bike racers jump and flip and shoot and generally cause a lot of destruction while the Angels try to catch a surfer assasin.  It's really thrilling to watch.
B000089RVX|4.0|You know I heard the first single bring me to life.I was thinking this is a one single wander trien to get a bigger saving's account.I was wrong.This cd is great.Her voice sounds good with the instramentals.I seen her play on hard rock live thou and it didn't sound that good thou.But over all this studio album is really good.Ol yea,Amy would look better with a tan thou.Over all I totally recomend you to buy this.
B00005JMF6|4.0|This Was the first time I ever got to see an advance screening of a movie. The movie has it faults but overall was a good movie. It is very suspenseful it will not only keep you guessing who did it but what exactly happen until the end.   I did say the movie has it's faults but it hard to explain without giving away the ending so I wont say any more about that. One thing I didn't like was Halle Berrys husband in the movie . A woman like Berrys character  would never marry a guy like him. He was just not right for the roll. Halle put on a good performance sheisa natural at playing a crazy lady.  This is a suspense full movie I did not see it as a thriller but I have never found Movies scary. I do think you should see this movie if you are a fan of Thrillers. I would give this movie a B.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I NEVER thought that I would buy a Britney Spears album, but I love her controversial &quot;new image.&quot; Except for a few treacly, unbareable moments (Shadow) this is a really kickin' album. It's much more mature in both subject matter (Touch of my Hand) and musicianship (Moby collaboration on Early Mornin'). Breathe on Me is destined to be remixed and to become a huge club hit. I can't wait. I don't have to remind anyone that this is pop music--nothing too deep, but good, fun, shake your booty music.
0783114893|5.0|The best horror/suspense film I've seen for a long time.  As Rutger is my fav actor he is brilliant as the Hitcher who C Thomas Howell (Jim Halsey) picks up unwittingly in the rain!<br />Overall comment on the DVD plus extras in the UK is that it is a slasher of a movie.  Very understated by some reviews I have read but by the Director and the cinematographer on the DVD commentary I have to agree that it is the best horror flick there is around.  I find this because the film doesn't have to show the whole of the killings to see how grisly it really is and what is going on in every scene to show what the actors are up to.  It is all up to the viewer's imagination.
B0000508U6|5.0|I bought Coldplay's Parachutes when I heard Yellow but I had not a chance to really sit down and listen to it.<br />After 3 years, I still have not gotten sick of Yellow. It's still one of my favorite songs.<br />1. Don't Panic 5/5 - Have you watched the video clip? It's so cute. Anyway, it's a good intro song. Very catchy. Sounds somewhat like a depressed person trying hard to be optimistic. But really cool. [We live in a beautiful world]<br />2. Shiver 5/5 - This is a really good song. It's one of my favourites. It's one of the faster tracks in the album. [I'll always be waiting for you]<br />3. Spies 3.5/5 - Maybe I just don't understand this song. So I think it's pretty weird to me. But it still sounds good. Slightly different from the rest.<br />4. Sparks 5/5 - I love how the intro starts and move towards the verse. Gives a very twisted kind of feeling. Pretty slow and soothing. One of my favorites!! [Yeah.. I saw sparks]<br />5. Yellow 5/5 - It's been 3 years and it's still on repeat. I am not bored of it yet, nor am I bored with Chris Martin's voice. EXCELLENT. My favourite. [Look at the stars, look how they shine for you] <br />6. Trouble 5/5 - This is the second single from Coldplay. Great song. [I never meant to cause you trouble]<br />7. Parachutes 5/5 - Interlude. Would sound fabulous if it was a song though. <br />8. High Speed 3.5/5 - Not their best, but it's still good enough. <br />9. We Never Change 4.5/5 - It's beautiful. I love how the song sounds rather depressing at one second and sweet next. [I want to live life..]<br />10. Everything's Not Lost 5/5 - Beautiful. <br />Oops. Looks like I gave most of the songs 5/5. But they deserve it.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|\\"In the Zone\\" employs an army of A-list producers and songwriters (Moby, R. Kelly, Guy Sigsworth, etc.), so it's no surprise that this CD is full of tight beats and cool sound effects. But this album is all style and no substance. Even though Britney supposedly wrote 7 of these songs, we learn absolutely nothing about her other than the fact that she's hot, she likes to party, and she broke up with her boyfriend (all of which we already knew). There's also an incredible hypocrisy at work here. Britney pants and moans through almost every track on this CD, and yet in interviews she still strikes her virginal pose, claiming celibacy. If she's telling the truth, what we have here is a girl willing to exploit her sexuality for the sake of her career, but unwilling to enjoy it in real life. That's a screwed up message to send young girls.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is awesome!!! I dont know about anyone else but IM glad she's bein herself now!!!
B0000931QR|1.0|This Cd is really bad. The songs are so tipically... it sounds chunky, maybe they are repeating themselves, her music is always the same.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I like this cd alot better than any of her other albums and more mature and some tight beats i really liked. My favorite song on the album is  i got that boom boom it gots a hip hop beat to it and i like it alot.I dont like britney spears though i only like her music but dont judge a cd by its artist.<BR>1.Me Agaisnt The Music-We all heard this one, you hate it when you first hear then you like after awhile but then hate it again, this song annoys me and sometimes it even gives me headaches.<BR>2.I got that boom boom-The best song in the album, i like the beat most of all, and it kinda sounds like her song boys from her previous album.<BR>3.Showdown- Another song with a tight ass beat its about make up sex that shows you shes now writting more mature songs.<BR>4.Breathe On Me-This song is alright but i dont understand why someone will write a song about breathing on eachother it just stupid thing to write about, it kinda sounds like modonnas song bedtime story.<BR>5.Early Mornin-This is a kul song but its one of those songs you have to listen to more than once to start liking it, it kinda sounds like pink's Gone To California but with more rhytem to it.<BR>6.Toxic-The beat of this song sounds like it came from an old western movie but its tight it makes u want to get up and dance.<BR>7.Outrageous-This song is cool to it sounds like an r kelley song well duh r kelley produced it it kinda sounds like a mature version of crazy but with a middle eastern beat.<BR>8.Touch Of My Hand-This song is obviously about \\"touching yourself\\" but i think thats kul i wrote a song about \\"touching yourself\\" 2, this song has an oriental beat to it it sounds like something madonna will sing.<BR>9.The Hook Up-This song is tight its a mature version of soda pop in my opinion at least, i like the beat on it and britneys voice on it also.<BR>10.Shadow-This song is alright i usually skip this one but its cool it kinda sounds like avril lavignes song im with you.<BR>11.Brave New Girl-This sounds like a more pop version of ray of light by madonna, its a real catchy song, i actually dont really like it but sometimes i find myself singing it so its kinda weird.<BR>12.Everytime-This is britneys best ballad by far. It kinda soundslike a mature version of sometimes mixed with madonnas song cant kiss her goodbye, i think this song is about justin timberlake.<BR>13.Me Against The Music Remix- I like the beat in the remix it has a middle eastern beat, i think its better than the original.<br />So thats my review hope it was helpful
B0000DD7LB|5.0|She has done it again. I totally love this album. I am a big fan of Britney and feel like this album is more up my ally then any of the two she has done. I feel that since i'm an adult i an relate more with this album but i also love her two previous ones as well. She is more grown up and more on adult themes that we can all relate too. Like \\"Touch Of My Hand\\".... \\"Everytime\\" which she wrote for a exact person two years ago. There's more tracks that you can totally relate too and love. Buy this album!!
B00000DR5I|5.0|I've worn out my original UK import LP of this album in the 1970s (yeah, I'm o-l-d). I then bought a US pressing, was disappointed by the quality (or lack thereof) of the copy, and found another import copy to wear out. I then bought the UK CD in the 80s because the US hadn't released it yet. Then I got the re-mastered version. I recently bought the SACD(which has a CD layer so it can be played on conventional CD players, too). This album has always been, and will always be, a major component to the soundtrack of my life.<br />  It is similar to Tangerine Dream's previous album, 'Phaedra', in that it is music that melts. But they take it a step further this time. I think it might have had to do with the advancements in the technological prowess of their equipment at the time, but on this album they were able to sustain the mood set by their synths for longer periods of time, thus the two sidelong pieces. But it is in the aural painting with such a wide palette of colors and textures, and at the same time mimicking the mania that might occur from sustained meditation on a frightening theme that sets it miles apart from their previous work, and all work to follow. Not only their work, but also every other attempt at extended tone-poem pieces that has been composed by an electronic artist.<br />  The beginning and of each piece are either nightmarish introductions or narcotic-like releases from the sequencer onslaught of the center of the pieces (and centerpieces). The mellotrons mimicking human voices on the start of 'Part II' is almost a direct quote from Ligeti's 'Requiem', and whether they knew this at the time or not, Tangerine Dream might have been touched by the same divine musical muse. The climax of each piece is evocative of an auditory house of mirrors, or an acoustic maze - even on repeated listenings, the sense of not knowing where the piece might take you is intense. I'd rather not use the analogy of an acid-trip beginning, climaxing, and ending, but I have a strange (and rather strong) feeling that this is what The Dream might have intended.<br />Many have stated that they like to use this album as background music, or music to fall asleep to. I agree, it can be used like that. But Tangerine Dream at this time in their career played this material live at almost deafening volumes, and I highly recommend that you try it with the volume on 11 once or twice.<br />  One may question whether or not this album is 'music'. Well, if you are open minded, you will agree that music is any organization of sounds that is either pleasing to the ear, or elicits an emotional response when played. Yet this is sound that is synaesthetic. It is music that you will see with your ears.I have a strange (and rather strong) feeling that this is what The Dream might have intended. <br />Many have stated that they like to use this album as background music, or music to fall asleep to.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I've been a fan of Brit's for, like, five whole years!  OMG... she is the best!  Her new album \\"In the Zone\\" is SOOgood!  I can't stop listening to it!!  The beats and lyrics are so phat, I just can't believe how different she sounds.  And yes, it is TOTALLY a good thing that she has a different sound.  The boy band/bubblegum pop sound was so two years ago.<BR> <BR>Britney's new sound is the best!  \\"In the Zone\\" is like, so much more mature than her other albums.  I can't even believe that this is the same girl that sang, \\"Oops, I Did It Again\\".  HA!!  Some of the new songs are actually kind of sexy, but what do you expect, she's getting older.  Remember, she's \\"not a girl, not yet a woman\\"!! :-) :-)<BR> <BR>One of the songs, \\"Touch of My Hand\\", is REALLY hot!!  Like, VERY hot!!! :o)  If my parents heard me listening to that, they would so FREAK OUT and stuff.  My parents don't like how she dresses all sexual and stuff for magazines, but they think her music is okay, so they probably won't mind!!  LOL!<BR> <BR>The title of the album is totally appropriate, because Britney was definitely \\"in the zone\\" when she was writing/recording these songs.  Everything is so mature, and you can, like, totally tell that she's singing about what she wants, and not listening to other people telling her what to sing.  I think it's, like, really cool that Britney and Madonna teamed up for \\"Me Against the Music\\".  Madonna used to be as popular as Britney when my parents were younger, but now she does more serious stuff that I don't really like.  Britney is totally giving Madonna mad props by saying, \\"I'm popular, and I want you to sing on my song so my fans know that you used to be cool\\".  That's mad respect.  <BR> <BR>\\"Me Against the Music\\" is a slammin' song that just makes you want to dance all night long.  It's kind of techno, kind of hip-hop, but it still sounds a lot like Britney, sort of.  I LOVE IT! :-O)<br />The best songs are \\"Breath on Me\\", \\"Outrageous\\", \\"Brave New Girl\\", and \\"The Hook Up\\".  Actually, all of them are good, but those are the ones that I, like, listen to the most of.<BR> <BR>\\"In the Zone\\" is the greatest!!  Believe me!  Justin is going to be so jealous after hearing this album, he'll be \\"crying a river\\".  LOL!! :) :) <BR> <BR>I LOVE THE NEW AND IMPROVED BRITNEY SPEARS!!! ;0)
B00003CXBK|4.0|I find most of it tiresome... Confusing or non-existing plots, thin characterizations, dialogue tangents that stray from the story, occasional surrealism to make even Salvador Dali go, \\"Huh?\\"  Princess Mononoke doesn't suffer from any of these.<br />Even if you're not a fan of anime, you should check this movie out.  The visuals are stunning.  One really can not praise this movie enough for its wonderful animation.  From the wide shot landscape scenery to the tight action, Princess Mononoke offers the best there is in Japanimation.<br />The story will make you comtemplative.  The \\"bad guys\\" aren't truly bad, and the \\"good guys\\" aren't 100% good.  It's all about shades of gray, like real life, but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of morality lessons one can carry away from it.<br />The English translation is well done by voice actors you will easily recognize, but I also recommend watching it in Japanese with subtitles.  The Japanese speech has a beauty to its rhythm that isn't as present in the English dialogue.  Also, there are some subtle differences in the subtitle translations versus the spoken translations.  They're minor, but I found them interesting none the less. &lt;P  Mononoke comes very close to being truly outstanding.  Give it a try.
B00006879E|5.0|This is one of the most diverse albums to come out in a long time. You get rock, funk, soul, and all of them mixed together. All the band members shine at different points, but the best thing about the album to me is the vocals. Adam Levine just has such attitude in his voice to go with great range, and like the songs has very different feelings in his singing.<br />1.Harder to Breathe- the first single and the most rockin song on the album. Just a totally kick...song. You can't help but sing along, whether you have someone to tell off or not.<br />2.This Love- keyboard-driven soul. You can feel Adam's pain, but it feels too good to stop <br />3.Shiver- the funky guitar riff in this song will get feet tapping and [backsides] shaking. Great singing (as always) on this one too.<br />4.She Will Be Loved- just a beautiful, perfectly done mid-tempo ballad. This one is destined for wedding receptions (and radio).<br />5.Tangled- a little more of a rocker. A story from a man whose made some mistakes but can sing ... about them<br />6.The Sun- a great, slower song about accepting change.<br />7.Must Get Out- more guitar-driven than the last few songs, but that turns out to be a good thing because of the great riff<br />8.Sunday Morning- this song would have been great with just Adam and the piano, but the rest of the band make it that much better<br />9.Secret- a sort of minimalist song (just drums, singing and a soft guitar strum), but it works to put the focus on the lyrics, and then it builds up wth piano and backing vocals<br />10.Through With You- unique in that it's a breakup song that makes you wanna dance<br />11.Not Coming Home- the crowd noises at the beginning is a nice touch to openthis song, but I don't think they really needed it through the whole song. But it doesn't take away from a great song<br />12.Sweetest Goodbye- another ballad, another masterpiece<br />So there you go. Twelve great songs make one incredible album. The best songs to me are She Will BeLoved, Shiver, Sunday Morning and Harder to Breathe. But these are all great. If you don't have this album, go get it and feel the love.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever!  Paul Thomas Anderson is a rare talent.  His 3rd film was in my opinion his best so far.  It's not surprising stars like Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore wouldn't hesitate to work in this movie.  All of the characters were so well realized, that there wasn't a single storyline that left me bored.  It's hard to describe Anderson's genius in words, but all it takes is one look at his work to see it.  Look at this, Boogie Nights and Punch Drunk Love in particular for a unique movie making style.  I wish he'd churn out movies more frequently; there was a 3 year gap between Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love.  My 2 favorite performances were by Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore.  They both should have won Oscars for their work.  Melora Walters and John C. Reily also stood out greatly for me.  The whole part leading up to the &quot;frog scene&quot; with all of the actors singing along to the similarly great and under rated talent, Aimee Mann, just had me mesmerized.  &quot;Wise Up&quot;?  Indeed I did after seeing this movie.  <BR>The DVD is really great too.  There is a great movie making diary and some other wonderful features on the 2 disc set.  I only wish PT Anderson had done a commentary track, so I could get inside of his head at least a little, and figure out how someone could write and make a movie of this caliber on only their 3rd outting.  I guess the same could be said for Sophia Coppola.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|[...]What we, the fans, are given is a polished product so slippery that I slid off my couch when I heard the title track. A far cry from what the original album was supposed to be, The Beatles raw.  Where is the full version of \\"Dig It\\"? featured on the Glyn Johns album, it is deleted completely here. What happened to the original ending of \\"Get Back\\" from the single? It was the best part of the song. Lennon's songs here are treated with very little care and enthusiasm.   The roof top version of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is dreadful and obviously remixed. The bit of gibberish John utters during the filmed footage is wiped away and replaced with lyrics sung in the studio. My favorite song of John's and The Beatles for that matter \\"Across The Universe\\", is still not officially released at the correct speed as produced on this new disc. The vocal is still sped up. Again check out the version on \\"Get Back\\" for the definitive version. And what is with that horrendous echo at the end of the song? I felt as though I was going into a wind tunnel. I wonder if McCartney is trying to tarnish the Lennon legend?  Where are the still unreleased songs from the \\"Get Back\\" sessions? Give us \\"Commonwealth\\", \\"The Walk\\" and \\"Suzy Parker\\". If they were included on this disc it may have been worth the purchase. These songs are nowhere to be found officially. I thought for sure they would have been included here, and properly so, since they didn't make the \\"Anthology 3\\" album.  Sir Paul what have you got to prove at this point? Thirty something years later.You have no need to do so at this stage of the game. We all know that you wrote \\"Yesterday\\" and John wrote \\"I Am The Walrus\\". Your song will be heard in a bar in Mexico somewhere. Whereas John's will not. The real fans know what Phil Spector did to your beloved \\"The Long And Winding Road\\". Check your ego Macca, with Spector's original release you still scored three number one song's remember? Why not just \\"Let It Be\\" for real? Give the fansthe much anticipated DVD of the film unaltered we've all been waiting for. We know your great Paulie and always will be.
B00006GEXQ|5.0|This is the greatest showcase for Hugh Grant's talents.  He really got kind of type cast in the 90s with pretty much every movie he did playing the stammering, floppy haired, nice guy.  But this was a truly breakthrough role for him (along with his character in Bridget Jones' Diary).  I'd kind of liken this role to John Cusack's in High Fidelity.  Two guys who you shouldn't really like, that you absolutely love.  I also enjoyed the supporting roles by Rachel Weisz (who's great in EVERYTHING she does) and Toni Collette and of course, Hugh's co-star Nicholas Hoult.  My favorite thing about this movie, besides the movie, was the music.  The entire soundtrack is from Badly Drawn Boy, and every song captures the feel and emotion of the movie.  The standouts being Silent Sigh and the instrumental I Love N.Y.E., Donna and Blitzen, and Something to Talk About.  So after you buy the movie, go out and buy the soundtrack as well.  They're both excellent.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|When Mer De Noms came out, i was stunned.  i loved it.  i have always been a fan of the classics, and have found modern rock (up until recently), while egregeously simplistic durring the modern minimalist movement, possessed of some strangely moving force.  Tool and A Perfect Circle (i recognise that they are almost nothing alike) are creating a form of Intelligent rock that i can really appreciate.  This work is Leaps And Bounds above Mer De Noms.  It seems to grow on you more and more with every listen.  Jordie White's influence can be heard, as well as the Tool members.   Some highlights are &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot;, a Queens of the Stone Age cover, in which Maynards puts forth a flowing display of vocal acrobatics, giving me chills again and again.  &quot;Pet&quot; is full of energy and has meaning, a great sound too.  Cant escape that beat =).  &quot;Gravity&quot; is DEFINATLY the best written song on the album, it is about embracing the curiousity that nurtures the human in us all. if you are one of those people who think in colors, the album makes me think blue-grey. wonderful album, buy it!  now!!!  (PS i saw them in concert recently, and their performance puts all recordings to shame, it was much better than the 2001 concert.  see them if you possibly can!!!)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is absoulutley excellent. It is by far Britney's best album, it sounds so different than her other CDs. Way to go Britney! I love it! Best tracks: 'Me Against The Music', '(I Got That) Boom Boom', 'Breathe On Me', 'Toxic', 'Touch Of My Hand', and 'Everytime'
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Well, there will always be critics, professional and amateur, who say that Britney stinks and can't sing.  Funny.  Sounds just like what they said about Madonna.  <BR>Personally I don't care so much that Britney doesn't have the vocal range to sing an aria at the Met.  That's not why I listen to, or like, her music.<BR>I think this album is much more mature than the others and I love the trancy bent to it.  It really is her most solid effort yet.  Love tracks 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11.<br />People who think that the musicians they listen to, and those they bash, make them cool kids should go back to posing and patting themselves on the back for thinking that Coldplay and the White Strips are SO brilliant.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|You  know what is sad, this CD won't get the credit it deserves simply because of those who don't like Britney, the media icon. <BR>If you take the Brit factor out of it, you have on the tightest vocal dance CD's. <BR>I love the more vulnerable track, Everytime. The melody is so pretty, and Brit wrote that. <BR>I hope this is a great transition for her. <BR>The effort on this CD should rightfully secure her place in music for years.
0844663662|3.0|When I start to read a book, I always read the summary on the back first. This book's summary did not help me at all. The book is without a doubt, very different indeed. Nothing could have prepared me for what Slaughter-House-Five had in store for me. On a scale of one to ten, I would have to give the book a five, because of the way it was formatted. The chapters jump around so much between time scenes, that it made it very difficult to follow along. Besides that, the book was written very well. Kurt Vonnegut is a very descriptive writer, but I could have done without the foul language.  <BR>     In a way, I feel that Kurt is Billy Pilgram, in that Kurt is senile and really thinks he is Billy. He might be suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), but that is too hard to tell from just one of his books. I've made that assumption thorough what I have felt the author was trying to say behind the lines. Kurt talks as himself in the first part chapter, and as if he were Billy in the rest of the book  <BR>     There were parts of this book that made me laugh out loud when I was reading it. Other parts of this book gave me a real feeling of what it was like to be in the war and the hardships people went through. One thing I am for sure of is that Kurt Vonnegut is a very descriptive writer. There is just something about Slaughter-House-Five that drawls you into it and keeps you going even when you want to quit.  <BR>     I truly enjoyed some parts of the book. I believe that the only reason that I wouldn't say that Slaughter-House-Five is one of my favorite books is because of the way that Kurt Vonnegut formatted it. I would recommend this book to a friend, if they really enjoyed reading and they could understand what is going on in between the lines.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|i thought this album was absolutely terrible.  I only liked one song on it.  Its bad enough that the lyrics were horrible and inappropriate, but the music behind them was equally as bad.  Sorry to say, but I dont think this album will go far at all.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I attended this concert on July 27th 2003. It was the best concert ever. I have not yet bought the DVD but I am sure it is great, since it will be showing all of her songs from the concert. I am not sure it if they aregoing to show the crowd, but if so, I was holding up a sign that read &quot;Shania, I rode your horse Dancer&quot; and the other side said &quot;Shania, welcome to Chicago!&quot; I really hope that is shown in the DVD to prove to my friends that I was only 5 rows from the stage. If you haven't seen a concert of her's I believe you should. This was the best concert ever! I will never forget this experience as long as I live. Thank you Shania for all that you have given to your fans!<br />Love,<BR>Jen
B00005JMFO|5.0|This was a very entertaining and uplifting movie.  It follows the lives of many different people who are all somehow connected to one another (friends, family, etc).  It shows the hearbreaks and triumphs of love.<br />The story involves so many people that it's hard to list them all here.  There's the Prime Minister (Hugh Grant, not Tony Blair), a boss, a writer, a man who just lost his wife, a couple that just got married, a man who has decided that he can't find love in Britain and must go to the States instead, a rock star. Their relationship trials are very different - finding love, keeping love, confessing love. Not all of the relationships are of the happily-ever-after nature.<br />Instead of telling one big story, the movie shows many little stories. They all fit neatly together to prove the theme of the movie - \\"love actually is all around.\\"
B0000027I6|5.0|Roger just push the limits with this album, I mean the sound quality is beyond any other album I've heard before.  I would pay 60$ for an album like... 3 wishes, Ballad of Bill Hubbard, perfect sense are so deep in imagination.  And what to say about the back vocals, they almost make me cry by their sincerity !  Sorry for the poor quality of my text, wish I had the words to express how I am in love with Waters.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think this is her best CD yet.  New sound to her my favorite is Touch of my hand(my favorite part is the beginning),breathe on me, and Toxic.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|(suddenly finding it difficult to review this while listening to 6 Degrees)<br />quite simply, to me this album is DT free of overly complicated songwriting.  that's not inherently good or bad, because they do both quite well.  what i most want to find out is what exactly they were listening to when they wrote it, because at various times i've heard resemblances (overtly or not) to Tool and some classic-style doom metal bands.  the main parts of the first 4 songs could almost be considered radio-friendly, and hey if the second halves of each song weren't so pure Dream Theaterish they might even hit the airwaves.  unfortunately, with most songs over 10 minutes, editing one would be like cutting someone off at the waist.  yes, there is some experimentation, but it's not so off-the-wall and unexpected that it sours the listener immediately.  it wasn't until the second listen that i even started to like it.  and i'm a metalhead through and through.  i won't go so far as to say it's &quot;the best&quot; because for me every DT album is so different from the others that i can't make that comparison.  happily, they all rule.
B00000K19E|5.0|It seems to a a film which actually occur, which made it even more exciting. As a woman I don't care or this genre, but I was meserized.
B0000A36J5|5.0|I am a Tolkien Purist.  I've read the books religiously for the last 15 years and I have to say that while there are changes, this is the most faithful to the books that I have ever seen an adaptation, while still making it available to people who would never have the patience to slog through Tolkien's admittedly amateur writing style.  <br />I was a little bit stunned when I saw it in theaters about the massive changes that Jackson and his team put into the books.  The movie didn't suffer for them, but I was incredibly dissapointed.  The extended edition scenes helped to explain all of it, and the appendices take that even further.  <br />I will not spoil this for you here, but if you are a purist who wants desparatly to like this movie, you have to see this extended cut.  The movie is far better explained with it, and the appendices explain much of the reasoning behind the changes, which as a writer myself I have to admit are understandable.  Don't cheat yourself out of a wonderful movie for a few elves and a personality change.  Sit back and let Jackson and his team take you through their magic.  You will love it as I do.
B00000I924|5.0|Where did he find the guitar he's playing here? And the amp? How does he find that sound out of a Strat?  I'm joking but Beck has a sound that is incredibly beautiful and unique. What he can do with a simple strat  is out of my ability to comprehend (and I'm a guitarist myself). His sound is so full, so human, so forward, so intense, so beautiful!! The way he plays a melody like he did here on Angel is incredible.  He is so lyrical! What an incredible way to let the note sing, resonate in your soul.. He is miles forward all the guitarists of our era.  They can play a zillion notes. Beck outplay them all with a simple melody, and a whammy bar effect ... what a master!! And what about all his Beckism, all his trademark rumors, bend, slides, whammy tricks he displays here on &quot;Space for the Papa&quot; for example? An astounding way of play art in music, a unique bag of tricks to send shivers down your spine ... crazy. I will buy whatever he will ever come out with. Every time I listen to Beck I have to sit down. He floors me.  I don't care if there are electronic loops and weird stuff here and there in this album. Everything Beck touches it becomes gold. He is so good its ridicolous. Someone here compares Beck to Page and Clapton ... c'mon guys be serious. Ah! Ah! Ah! Don't make me laugh. They are mummies, '60's dinosaurs ... Beck is playing music ready for  the next millenium (3000).  Eternal music! He takes risks, he plays from the heart, he has personality, fantasy, musical charisma. Clapton and Page cannot even be his roadies!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I first listened to the new cd in my car and even though I had reached my destination,I kept driving so I could finish the last song! It is outstanding. I loved the first cd, but nothing like this one. The arrangements are so much more sophisticated and rich. I guess when you are Josh's age, there will be a maturing in style and voice for many years to come. I look forward to his developing even more as an artist...if that is possible.
0385508417|5.0|This book caught my eye last year, but I never got around to reading it. I found it this year and absolutely loved it. It was a very quick and easy read. Everyone can relate to the frenzy that surrounds Christmas and this book puts a humorous spin on it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Oh my!! I just LOVE this album! It's so good!! I agree with the other reviewer who stated that you can't judge the album just from hearing &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; (MATM)  MATM is a good song but the ones I like a whole lot better include &quot;Toxic&quot; and the &quot;Boom Boom song&quot;  I loved the song &quot;Everytime&quot; when she sang it on Saturday Night Live but the one on the album, in my opinion, isn't as good. With all that said, this is a definite album for working out, cleaning house, and dancing out at clubs as it really has some beats. Turn it up in the car and the bass gets pumping! Who would of thought?? Great Album Britney! Hit us one more time...or many more for years to come!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|[...]Paul McCartney said it best. The album is \\"The Band\\" and that's it...no thrills no nothing..and if you are into this...which I am...then buy the album..I highly recommend it.
B0000C0FJB|4.0|If you saw the Vapor Trails tour, this will remind you of how great that show was, and if you didn't, this is almost as good.  Some people have complained about the cheering crowd and the iffy sound quality.  Considering that Rush releases an &quot;official&quot; live with near-studio quality every four albums, we're way early with this one, roughness aside.  Call it bonus material- and personally, When I go to a Rush concert, part of the experience IS the screaming crowd.  There you are shaking your fist and singing along and everyone around is doing the same.  This recording captures that, and the energy of the show very well.  If you want studio quality, go get your headphones and one of their studio albums.  The set is great, and i think the screaming crowd and rawness really set this apart from their other live albums.  According to the band, this show was simultaneously a low point in technology and predictability, and a high point in crowd energy and enthusiasm-  of course it sounds rough.  And cool.  Quit whining and go support your favorite band.
B000002B7U|5.0|Well let me start out by saying that this IS the second best album(No More Tears being the first), and it is extremely underrated. Casual fans of Blizzard of Oz, might hate this album, but true fans will love it.<br />Jake E. Lee is back on guitar, Phil Soussan on bass, and Randy Castillo makes is drumming with ozzy debut. Randy Castillo always will be the best drummer, Michael Inez is a better bassist than Soussan though.<br />As for guitarists, I can't compare them. Ozzy's guitarists are all great, so none is better than the other, they all have unique things about them. <br />The songs are all great here, no filler songs.<br />Here's how I rate them:<br />The Ultimate Sin-The ultimate opener. Great, strong riff, exceptional vocals. A masterpiece. 10/10<br />Secret Loser-Self-parody track, note the chorus(awesome). 9/10<br />Never Know Why-&quot;Never know why-we rock!&quot; A big f**k you to anyone who thinks that ozzy's music is bad or evil or sucks!!!!!! 10/10<br />Thank God for the Bomb-Some people think this is the album's weak point. I personally think this song is great. (ONE PROBLEM- Note the riff at the beginning is similar to Van Halen's &quot;ain't talkin' 'bout love&quot;) 9.5/10<br />Never-The riff at the beginning is great, it really shows of Jake's talent. 9/10<br />Lightning Strikes-Rips off the crazy train riff a bit... But it's better that Ozzy or his guitarist rip off a riff from one of his songs than some other band like Twisted Sister(no offense &quot;guys,&quot; you're still one of my favorite bands). 10/10<br />Killer of Giants-Wow! A powerful ballad that just makes you think about war, and is as musically deep as it can be. 10/10<br />Fool Like You-Song about foolish people and foolish lives. The guitar playing is what keeps this song a gem. 9/10<br />Shot in the Dark-The best song on the album. By the way, ozzy hates this song now, but I still love it. Great guitars, and vocals. 10/10<br />So, there's my opinion. I hope this review was somewhat helpful, or something like that.<br />The Ultimate Sin is well... ultimate. <br />                                         Rock on,<BR>                                         MasterOfMetal
B00004XPOZ|5.0|It has been said that after Star Wars III has been released (May, 2005) George Lucas will release all six films on dvd in a big box set(7 discs total, 1 for bonus footage). This will not happen til 2007. It'll probably be a $99.00 retail. But I went out and bought a dvd recorder and made all three films on dvd disc. The quality was way better than the original vhs tape. So I guess It'll be worth the wait...

B0000C1733|4.0|This is actually the second &quot;Best of&quot; from them. The first being &quot;What Hits?&quot;, taken mostly from the first four albums. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is about what you would expect. It includes the big hits &quot;Give It Away&quot;, &quot;My Friends&quot;, &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, and &quot;By The Way&quot;, among others. It isn't quite perfect though. I don't really think &quot;Road Trippin'&quot; or &quot;Universally Speaking&quot; belong here, and would rather see &quot;Breaking The Girl&quot;, &quot;Around The World&quot;, and &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot; included. But otherwise this is a great intro to 90's &quot;Peppers&quot;, and is also available with a DVD full of videos. Either collection is awesome, and if you don't like it, &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot;.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|...this CD would have made me one. She keeps getting better and this CD rocks.  The songs are really good.  A lot of people would be suprised that they actually like a Britney song, well get prepared because your about to like a whole slew of them. I listened to the whole CD and I can honestly say I like all of the songs, they may not be my favorites but I won't skip to the next song. Britney sure knows what she's doing and she's doing it well...really well. Even if you think you don't like Britney, listen to a couple of clips from this album. I'm sure you'll change your mind, even if you don't tell anyone. :) I'm not going to go through each song but this album has a dance, urban vibe to it. No bubblegum pop, even the ballads (2) are good. Buy this CD, give it a chance, if you don't like it...you can sell it but I doubt you will.
B0000DJE9R|4.0|Another disc of his &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. The question is, besides the DVD, is &quot;Number Ones&quot; better than &quot;HIStory Volume 1&quot;? It's pretty much a matter of what songs you really want. The 15 track &quot;HIStory&quot; has &quot;She's Out Of My Life&quot;, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, and &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot;, which this does not. But this 18 track cd includes &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;, and &quot;You Rock My World&quot;, plus others, which &quot;HIStory&quot; doesn't. Also besides having more tracks, and going beyond 1995, this of course has a DVD full of 15 videos. So as you can see, the decision may not be &quot;Black And White&quot;, but either way you can't &quot;Beat It&quot;.
B00007AJGH|4.0|If you, as I, live in the DVD region 1, don't bother with the one disc version available to us.  Instead invest in this belter of a twin disc set that is all knobs and whistles.  Best bits are the shorts (particularly 'Rollercoaster Rabbit'), Toon Town Confidential and Benny the Cab guiding you through the menus.  Saying all this, the film is starting to show it's age a bit now with some dodgy composite shots that are magnified with sparkling DVD quality but I still prefer this to CGI!
0792841344|5.0|Yeah, before \\"Alien\\" came along and people actually spent MONEY in the making of horror movies, this is pretty much the way it was done.  You'd have the same guy that wrote the screenplay be the director and probably the producer as well.  There wouldn't be any kind of a budget involved, so you'd have actors that were more likely the writer/director's film school (or drinking) buddies, and these actors would have varying degrees of acting skill, usually ranging from sub-par to non-existant (Shakespeareans need not apply).  What special effects that could be afforded generally tended to be home-made and as simple as possible.  With any luck the writer/director would already have a distribution arrangement in hand by the time shooting began, with most of the run to be held at drive-in movies over the summertime.  All that you needed to make this dream a reality was a good story.<br />And that's what makes \\"Phantasm\\" so good.  The acting isn't all that, there are absolutely dreadful moments for pretty much all of the main characters.  But the characters themselves are endearing enough so that you DO make the connection; Reggie with his ponytail and his ice cream truck, Mike with his very real fears of abandonment (instilled first by the loss of his parents and then by the possibility of his older brother leaving town), and of course Mike's older brother Jody with his Plymouth 'Cuda (not actually a Hemi Cuda, as sadly confirmed in the magnificent DVD commentary track) and that \\"I'm-really-doing-all-I-can-to-look-like-Han-Solo\\" '70's blow-dry haircut.<br />The story is original enough for its time...beings from another dimension are posing as morticians and stealing and reanimating dead bodies from a small town in Anywhere, USA to use as slave labor in their home world.  Our heroic trifecta discover the plot and attempt to stop them.  The embodiment of the plot, \\"The Tall Man\\" possesses supernatural powers (including a form of mind control as well as a telepathic link to several metallic spheres which perform work similar to that of the ancient Egyptians who removed organs from bodies slated for mummification).  Our heroes have only their own friendship, a few small arms, and a bad-ass car.  And that's it; from that story this drive-in movie flooded its banks and escaped into mainstream release to become one of the top-grossing movies of 1979 and the inspiration for a further flood of sequels (most of which, admittedly, go straight-to-video).<br />This is where I say the movie is worth buying just on the basis of it being an archival example of the 1970's horror movie (the only thing separating them from the pornography of the same era was the violence in one and the sex in the other) that actually happens to be a good movie on its own merits.  But for the sake of the movie fan who enjoys a well-loaded DVD at a good price, \\"Phantasm\\" is really hard to beat.  The standard widescreen presentation/5:1 sound ratio would be enough for the offered price for someone who just had a fond memory of the movie itself, but the Commentary track is outstanding, the deleted scenes are entertaining (nice to see I'm not the only one who appreciates the healing properties of Dos Equis beer), and the interviews with Angus Scrimm at the FantasyFest and with Don Coscarelli by Mr. Miami Leisure Suit are just fantastic.  Consider also that there is an audio track including Bill Thornbury (\\"Jody\\") singing and playing \\"Sittin' Here At Midnight\\" in its entirety and a pop/disco take of the movie's memorable main theme, you really can't go wrong.  This is one of the few DVD's that doesn't need a re-release; they couldn't possibly add any more to it.  Definitely check it out...but don't be expecting \\"Hamlet\\".several metallic spheres which perform work similar to that of the ancient Egyptians who removed organs from bodies slated for mummification).

B00005JKHN|2.0|This was sneaked out onto release on region 2 disc ages ago in England (minus commentary). Although the film is visually stunning and has some nice set pieces it lacks warmth and, with some small exceptions, has no compelling characters.  The extras are as dry as sticks and smack of the pompous.  If you want a special edition Disney disc stick to 'The Lion King' or 'Beauty and the Beast'.
6305078181|4.0|I have always believed that at least part of the reason this movie isn't better known is because it is confused just as much now as it was in 1979 with the comedy \\"Love at First Bite\\" featuring supertan George Hamilton as Dracula released at the same time.  It is a dreadful misconception as \\"...First Bite\\" was a cross between horror spoof and Disco exploitation flick...which was and is absolute torture to watch.<br />This addition to the \\"Dracula\\" franchise is my personal favorite of all that have been attempted.  I don't rate it as being the most faithful interpretation of Bram Stoker's classic novel (Francis Ford Coppola's \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" holds that distinction, obviously enough...though Coppola also added more of the real history of \\"Vlad the Impaler\\" to his movie for additional background; nice touch), but for the sheer gothic style that the novel used to shock and horrify Victorian England upon its first publication, this movie comes as close to Stoker's original intent without necessarily following his novel on a word-for-word basis.<br />Frank Langella's performance onstage had to be one for the ages if it at all approached the level of his portrayal as the Count in this movie.  Ultimately he has never delivered a performance quite like it...and of course with opposing roles filled by Sir Laurence Olivier and veteran character actor (and overperformer of Shatneresque proportions) Donald Pleasance were definitely sufficent to insure that Langella brought his \\"A\\" game to the set for every shoot.  All performances are superb.<br />Additionally, the originality surrounding the climax of the movie alone makes it worth a viewing; the old Hammer films had interesting ways for the Count to meet his ultimate demise, and the manner in which this movie ends is very reminiscent of those latter day classics.  You almost wish Christopher Lee could have had a guest appearance in this movie a la Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck in the 1991 remake of \\"Cape Fear\\".<br />Regarding the widescreen DVD's color transfer (or lack thereof), I do think that the washed out tones (which are nearly black and white, as noted in a previous review) actually adds to the movie's atmosphere.  This is, basically, the second great gothic love story of all time (with E. Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" being the first); the blacks and the whites SHOULD be more pronounced, the funereal elements of Carfax Abbey should be brought out (the dinner scene with the Count and Mina is one of the most beautifully shot scenes from any movie...romance just isn't done that way anymore), and washing the colors from a movie as easily as blood from a vein leaves the correct pallor for both a vampire's victim and a terrific retelling of the \\"Dracula\\" story.  You can hold out hope that a remastered DVD will be released (as this version seems to be out-of-print presently) that will feature a better color transfer, but as this movie approaches its 25th year, hope for any such treatment fades.Regarding the widescreen DVD's color transfer (or lack thereof), I do think that the washed out tones (which are nearly black and white, as noted in a previous review) actually adds to the movie's atmosphere.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|As a Beatle-obsessed person, I had severe misgivings about tinkering with this album, particularly when John and George aren't here to weigh in on their opinions. We all know Paul has complained ad nauseum about Phil Spector's maudlin strings arrangement on The Long and Winding Road and it was Paul who pushed for this new remastering, though he wasn't physically in the studio during the cleaning-up process. Let it Be has long been considered one of the weaker Beatles albums, but it does boast several Paul classics. John fares much more poorly here, and the addition of Don't Let Me Down bolsters his input significantly.<br />What is the result? A surprisingly pleasing package with definite improvements on several tracks, though two songs are much weaker that the original Spector work. The mix of acoustic guitars and bass lines on several tracks is especially striking. It's admittedly difficult to get used to the new LP when we've all had 33 years to grow accustomed to the original Let it Be. I don't like the new track order and miss that Get Back doesn't end the album, as it did in 1970. Also missing are the Beatles chatter in between songs, and I still want to hear \\"Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats\\" as the prelude to Two of Us, and John's \\"I hope we pass the audition,\\" at the conclusion of Get Back. If you were one of the few who adored Dig It and Maggie Mae, those two songs have been dumped, a decision which significantly strengthens the album, along with the addition of John's rooftop version (minus his gobbily-gook verse) of Don't Let Me Down.<br />Unless you're a Beatles fanatic, most people won't even notice the subtle difference on many of the songs, especially Two of Us and Get Back. The significant differences appear in the de-Spectorization of The Long and Winding Road. Paul's plaintive vocal is beautiful and though I never liked this song, it has grown exponentially in appeal minus the sappy, soaring strings in the middle eight.  However, the absence of strings reveals a terrible, jangly, noise which begs for the absent violins! The real loser is John's extremely underrated gem, Across the Universe. Spector introduced a chorus and strings in the 1970 version and also slowed down the vocal. This is a beautiful song with an amazing lyric, and stripped of its pretensions, it remains a simple, yet eloquent masterpiece. But there is no doubt the Spector version is far superior.<br />Another criticism is George's guitar solo in Let it Be, which is an inexcusable switch from the single version. Though Paul's vocal, Ringo's drums and the piano sound much better here, the guitar solo is dreadful.<br />It will take awhile to get used to the new versions and this in no way replaces the original LP. But the crisp sound will send shivers down your spine, it really is as if the boys are in your living room, singing directly to you. That alone is worth the price of admission. Highly recommended.e of strings reveals a terrible, jangly, noise which begs for the absent violins! The real loser is John's extremely underrated gem, Across the Universe.

B00005QXXO|4.0|I heard True Love Waits on one of Radiohead's many sites. It featured a very crafty background sound that played alongside the guitar. This cd has the guitar but doesn't have the sound.If you're looking for the version I have mentioned, you won't find it on this cd. It's only the guitar and Thom's voice for that particular song. Also, the version I first heard has Thom's voice in a small, minimal tone. This cd's version has it loud and totally different. Just a note of caution.
B00005UM42|4.0|If you like slow-burning westerns with phenomenal acting, this is one to see. Marlon Brando, who starred and directed, is magnificent as a brooding outlaw named Rio. After five years in a Mexican prison, Rio is on the prowl for his former partner, Dad Longworth, who betrayed him after a bank holdup. He discovers that Longworth has become a wealthy sheriff in a small coastal town. Rio makes his presence known, biding his time and allowing his former buddy to believe that the past is forgotten. But he runs into some trouble while in town. Longworth takes the opportunity to smash Rio's gun hand in a public display, then has him thrown in prison to be hanged. We're left wondering how Rio will ever get his revenge.<br />Martin Scorcese has described this as his favorite western. Rod Serling (&quot;Twilight Zone&quot;) worked on the first draft of the script, then Sam Peckinpah (&quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;) was hired to rewrite it. Stanley Kubrick was the director, but was later replaced by star Marlon Brando. This is Brando's first and only stint as a director, and though it isn't perfect, it's darn good. He does tend to let scenes drag on a little long, and there were some tedious parts that probably should have been left out, but I'd say about 75-80 percent of this film hits the mark.<br />As an actor, Brando dominates virtually every scene, drawing you in, making you feel what he's feeling. His character is a real son-of-a-b*tch, a liar and a scoundrel, but you come to empathize and root for him by the end. Pina Pellicer, who plays Rio's love interest Louisa, is a very fine actress who holds her own opposite Brando. She looks like a Mexican Audrey Hepburn. There really were no weak actors. Karl Malden, who played Longworth, is appropriately two-faced, a real &quot;one-eyed jack&quot;.<br />The dialogue is very authentic. I've seen westerns where they talk like modern day folks, but in &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; the dialect is pure 19th century outlaw. It's great to hear Brando call some guy a &quot;scum-sucking pig&quot; or a &quot;big tub of guts&quot;.<br />I like westerns, and this is one of the best that I've seen. It's slow-paced, but it's so good that I didn't mind. It's very character-driven, which I like. It's great to see Brando in his prime. Released in 1961, this film had a significant influence on the revisionist westerns (Sergio Leone, etc.), which started around the mid-1960s. Thumbs up for &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot;!<br />(There are numerous versions of this movie floating around, but from what I've read Unicorn Studio's is the one to get.)
B000088E6D|5.0|His voice is like Sinatra's but even better. I love this cd.  If you are a fan of silky smooth vocals, you will not be disappointed.  Listen to this cd with the one you love and guaranteed you will fall in love even deeper.  I can't get enough of him.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I'm not even going to bother commenting on the negative reviews.  This band continues to impress me.  Every CD of theirs seems to have a different &quot;flavor&quot; to it, distinct from previous recordings.  You have to give the band credit for that!  Don't expect 2 or 3 formula rock CDs from these guys!  Never!<br />Like others, I knew this was to be more of a &quot;metal&quot; CD, and had no idea what to expect.  I love it!  So different, but so Dream Theater.  I won't bother tearing apart each song, but will say this...if you expect a clone of IaW or 6DoIT (which I'm under the impression some of you desire), you're not going to get it.  Instead, you're going to hear Dream Theater rocking hard and heavy in the distinctive Dream Theater manner.  Yes, it's different than previous recordings...but so what!!
B0000028VT|4.0|This one is a very good album. Mariah Carey is a very very good singer. She sings better than Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne or Jeniffer Lopez, without a doubt. You could be better listening to Mariah Carey, instead of Britney Spears, and all of those pop princesses. <br />On this album the songs are fine, but not each of them. I did not give this album 5 stars, because here are some poor songs, like Anytime You Need A Friend 2/5, All I've Ever Wanted 1/5, I Been Thinking About You 2/5. My favorite songs from this album are Withhout You 5/5, Dreamlover 5/5, Hero 4/5, and Never Forget You 4/5. When you want to buy an album, first read a review !!! I really really recommend it for you. ....
B0000DJZA5|2.0|\\"Let it be... naked\\" is not for the casual fan, but more for the hard core Beatles fanatic.  This release was totted as a remixed back to basic \\"what it should have been the first place\\" release, but really doesn't sound that different than the \\"official\\" Phil Spector version, with few exceptions.  The most notable changes are the track order, track selection (no Maggie Mae or Dig it, but it has the added addition of Don't let me down).  Missing also are the in-between song chatter which actually makes the original album flow.  <br />The songs all sound very good and clean, but the noteworthy gems are \\"I've got a feeling\\" with great harmonies between John and Paul (I like this version better than the other album version), One after 909 which just sounds more together and cohesive, I Me Mine is now a lot more guitar driven without the overdubbed strings.  You hear the mastery of George Harrison and his superb guitar playing.  As well, \\"Don't let me down\\" is a great addition to the set list.  I'm pretty sure this is actually taken directly from the roof top concert itself.  \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", although not one of my favorite songs, also sounds quite different with out its string back drop.  The rest of the material sounds similar to the \\"Let It Be\\" album or the material of \\"Anthology 3\\".<br />I feel that it's important to note that long time Beatles producer George Martin had no input into this project.  In fact, both surviving Beatles had no input as well.  After the work was completed they were given a copy for their approval and that was it.<br />The most disappointing aspect of \\"Let It Be... naked\\" is that most Beatles fans know it could have been so much better.  This seems to be the aspect that haunts this new CD the most.  Perhaps they could have made a \\"let it be\\" box set that was more in the style of Anthology.  Along with these new reworked versions they could have had demos and alter versions of songs.  They could have included some of the vast unreleased material that was recorded during the intense month long recording period in 1969, some of which can be heard in tiny snippets on the 2nd \\"fly on the wall\\" CD.  What a tease!  Shame on them!  It's like holding a piece in front of a dog.  Who needs a fly on the wall CD anyway?  That's what the film is for!  They could have put something more meaning full of that disk!<br />Speaking of which, where's the DVD?  Where's the full roof top concert?  It seems only logical that they would coincide the release of the DVD with the album.<br />The truth of the matter is that no matter how many remixes or reworking they attempt \\"Let It Be\\" will always be the one that got away.  These sessions were undisciplined, unfocused, plagued with disagreements and unhappiness.  The whole band was out of sync with one another and no filter or setting in Pro Tools (the audio software used to do the remixing for this album) can fake or fix that.  <br />For all these reason, and many more, we'll never truly know what \\"Let It Be\\" could have been.
B00005OM4N|3.0|This album is good. The songs are fine. But Britney's lyrics do not make me happy. This album needs a explicit lyrics sign. I want the new album to be better. If you are fan you can buy it.<BR>If you are not a fan, I don't recommend it for you.
B000002NE4|5.0|This album is THE fruit created after the famous and critically acclaimed Murder Ballads album.  Amazing isn't it?  This album was written during the time of the Murder Ballads albums.  It is a more mature and poetic Nick Cave singing behind that Grand Piano with the sweet sounds of the Dirty Three's violinist Warren Ellis.  It shows a side of him that no one has ever seen before, talking about love, religion, and life.  What do you expect from a &quot;Subdued album&quot; that is intended for the romantics?  Pick this album up and you won't be disatisfied.  Hey Nick, don't let them talk you down...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Upon hearing the first single off this album, I was expecting nothing less then pop-influenced dance drivel. How surprised I was when-upon reading some decent reviews and deciding to take a chance-the album was extremely listenable! The single doesn't do justice to the rest of the songs, with many influenced with a very trance-y vibe, from the quirky beats of Showdown to the very... bass of Breathe On Me (the total standout track in my oppinion), this album blew me away. Granted, the girl doesn't have the best voice in the industry, but she's definately tried some different vocal techniques and it really works for her. For anyone wanting to purchace a very awesome record in the near future, give this one a try, you won't be dissappointed :)
B00009TB5G|5.0|Yeah...I gotta love how these nerds come on here and talk about how they saw an &quot;early&quot; version of the new edit of Peter Jacksons epic The Two Towers, yet they say nothing but mindless rhetoric such as &quot; I won't ruin it for anyone but...&quot; or &quot;IT IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL&quot;...in CAPS. Thats about as profound and useless as football broadcasters telling us during the game that &quot; the team that lets up the most touchdowns in this game is gonna have a hard time winning the game!&quot;. What a bunch of morons. This idiot probably hasn't even seen the extended version (prior to it's release date, but nerd boy probably was at tower records at midnight to be the first of all his nerd friends to get the first copy) but still had to come on here and make everyone feel like he had some kind of insider information about the new edit, which we know he really didn't. Look, fork face....say something worth saying or go back into your garage and continue your 78 hour long game of Dungeons and dragons with Skippy and the rest of the Information and technology department from your work and don't come out till you have killed the 3 headed dragon with a +25 hit damage dark magic mace. Friggin jerk offs....<br />For all you others.....See this movie. It is truely a spectacular acheivement in movie making.<br />Nuff said.

B000092ZYX|1.0|basically all that needs to be said about this so-called music is that &quot;IT SUCKS&quot; and is an insult to anyone who has any sense of good taste!!! i regret even taking the time to listen to any of it!!! big waste of time!!! it was completely aggrivating and totally &quot;BORING&quot;!!! like i said, it just &quot;SUCKS&quot;!!!
B00008PW2D|1.0|Being a huge Sex and the City fan, I've decided not to pay into HBO's greed and buy the 5th. season on DVD.  It's only 8 episodes long and double disc...why are we being charged full price?  Why couldn't they put in an extra disc of extras or bloopers?  Frankly, it's not worth the $33.  I think I've had too much Sex and the City this time around...bye girls!
6305308659|4.0|David Wagner (Tobey Maguire) is an high school kid obsessed with the 50's TV series \\"Pleasantville\\", which seems an ideal place, far from his girlless, nerdlike life with feuding divorced parents.  He is mysteriously transported, with his sister Jennifer (Reece Witherspoon) into the black and white world of Pleasantville.  At first David eagerly adopts the mode of life there, but he and Jennifer soon bring change--and color--to Pleasantville--both good and bad changes.<br />  Well cast, with William H. Macy doing wonders as the kids' \\"father\\" in Pleasantville, Joan Allen as their \\"mother\\", and Jeff Daniels as the owner of the malt shop who, as things change in Pleasantville, develops a long-suppressed interest in Allen.  Jane Kaczmarek does a nice small part as the kids' real mother, one quite different from \\"Malcolm\\".<br />  In some ways nicely thought out (\\"Bud\\" is gone an hour, the time of two weekly episodes in Pleasantville (and it is pretty clear what the episodes would have been about, until the kids change things)) but it seems like two weeks in Pleasantville, in others not so well thought out (How could Bud and Bill paint a mural in the dark?  If the Pleasantville basketball team is undefeated, and there is no other school, who do they play?).  Still, quite thought provoking.<br />  Well shot, with scenes in a bowling alley evoking \\"Patton\\" and at Lovers Lane evoking \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\".<br />  I withhold a fifth star due to the heavyhandedness of the messages that Gary Ross gives us in the second half of the movie.  It could have been done better, more subtly.  Also, Maguire's acting isn't directed quite as well as it could be by Ross.  Maguire is made to come out with these profound statements (\\"Maybe it isn't just the sex\\" \\"There is no right house.  There is no right car\\") in the same offhand, almost squeaky manner.  It becomes a bit tiresome.<br />  The DVD features are quite good, including the trailer, audio commentary, and being able to watch the movie with just the music, by Randy Newman and very nice.<br />  Recommended.the movie with just the music, by Randy Newman and very nice.<br />  Recommended.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I agree that this album is going to get a lot of bad publicity for the simple fact that it is Britney Spears. However, the album is a production masterpiece, it's immaculate. All the sounds and vocals are so clean and solid, it would be hard to criticize the quality of sound that this album has. Britney definitely compensate for what she lacks in vocals with musical creativity. At least now, no one can critize Britney of conforming to pressures to be a role model; she's grown a lot and seem to experimenting with verying musical types. This album is far more mature and a lot more progressive than her other releases, and more than half the album is very electronic, almost techno sounding. It's an interesting album with many differenct styles, and it is definitely worth purchasing-- maybe the future direction of Pop/Rock music??.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Few things can kill a movie series like success.<br />Just as George Lucas' &quot;Star Wars&quot; films have gotten increasingly unwatchable, the sequel to &quot;The Matrix&quot; already shows that success, money and hype have successfully insulated the Brothers Wachowski from criticism or even the ability for someone around them to question &quot;why is this action sequence so long,&quot; &quot;why is there a Mad Max rave scene with Morpheus totally acting out of character,&quot; &quot;what is the point of the whole sequence with the Merovingian,&quot; or, most importantly, &quot;why would you go two hours of nothing but action and then dump all this philosophy and obscure information on audiences in the final 10 minutes?&quot;<br />It's especially frustrating because &quot;The Matrix&quot; had built up so much good will towards it that the brothers didn't need to pander to their audiences -- being just as smart as the first film wouldn't have been rejected by the audience, but instead, we get a vastly dumbed-down film that fails to wow, and certainly fails to elicit any enthusiasm for the third installment in the series.<br />There are worse films out there, but few that have so squandered their potential along the way.<br />Recommended only for the most diehard &quot;Matrix&quot; fans.
B00008DDXC|3.0|I've never been a fan of this type of fantasy movie, but Chris Columbus has done a pretty good job. This the second Harry Potter flick, and better than the first. Through excellent effects and good acting performances, fans and non-fans of all ages will be able to enjoy &quot;Chamber.&quot;<br />The level of realism throughout the film is excellent. I've never been an avid Harry Potter reader, but I was able to quickly catch on to the plot and the different environments. Having little HP experience, I was a bit eager to have the movie end earlier. It did seem a bit long in the theater, but less so at home. The DVD provides great value and some nice extra features. Overall, I liked the movie with my limited experience, and thought it was well put together. More avid Harry Potter fans than I will like it even more.
B0000C7PRY|3.0|This is my third revision of my review here. When I originally purchased this album, I had my preconcieved notions.  One of the major contributing factors to my being a fan of SB for so long was Neal's ability to write progressive music (and lyrics) which were accessable.  Most music which is labeled as \\"progressive\\" tends to be pompous or intellectual (or both).  While with SB, Neal wrote music which was accessable to a wide audiance, yet was still considered progressive.    I don't think anyone who has listened to the album could argue that the music is not excellent.  Neal proves himself as both a Keyboard player and a fairly accomplished guitarist.  And when you put his talent together with Mike Portnoy, watch out!  However, I couldn't put my finger on what I didn't like about this album.  At first, I thought it was simply what most people were saying...that the album suffered because Neal is now writing progressive music under the CCM guise.  After listening to the album a couple dozen times, I don't entirely believe this is true.  The thing that's bothering me is that I believe progressive artists are supposed to challenge themselves to break new ground.  Lyrically, this album does not.  Furthermore, I believe if Neal continues in this direction (which it looks like both of his newest post-Testimony projects are shaping up this way) then the CCM world may be finding itself with a new great talent while the progressive world may soon be losing one.    That having been said, the reason I'm giving this album as high a rating as I am is because this is one of most heartfelt and touching albums to which I have ever listened.  Progressive -- CCM -- whatever you want to call it, you can feel the pure emotion pouring into the microphone when he sings \\"I Am Willing\\" and \\"Somber Days.\\" Testimony simply is a truly touching story of one man's struggle to find himself.  Coupled with the fact that this is the creative genius behind SB (teaming up with, arguably) the most talented drummer on the face of the earth (save for Neal Peart, anyway) this album is definitely worth the price tag.
B0000CAQ26|5.0|Impressive c.d. by a maturing musician.  With every album Pink seems to be coming into her own and this latest installation, definetely proves this.  She has changed quite a bit from her previous c.d., but this is a good thing.  I wouldn't say this is a &quot;punk&quot; record like some reviewers like to classify it, but a good straight ahead rock record with its occasional softer moments and a few songs with horns thrown in to enhance her sound to a new level.  <BR>The first c.d. was a 2 star, the second a 3 star, but this get's the thumbs up and a 5 star.  Working with Tim Armstrong was a stroke of genius and you will all understand it when this sound hits your ears and you can't help but tap your toes and bob your head from side to side.<BR>And the scary thing is, she's just going to get better!!!  LOOK OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00009MGGI|5.0|Wonderful adaptation of the Michael Dobbs \\"House of Cards\\" trilogy.  Ian Richardson plays Francis Urquhart, Chief Whip of the Conservative Government, who schemes his way to Number Ten through blackmail, backroom deals, and sheer gall.  The second volume, \\"To Play the King\\" shows Urquhart up against the newly crowned King (Michael Kitchen, who does a wonderful take on Prince Charles, really stealing the show) with Britain not big enough for the two of them.  \\"The Final Cut\\" shows Urquhart hanging on against the wiles of the younger generation, while Diane Fletcher, as Urquhart's loyal, Lady-Macbeth-like wife, has her greatest acting moments.<br />  Well cast, well directed, and with three thrilling political stories.  However, this series would be nothing without Richardson, who amazes.  Perhaps the best moments are when he breaches the fourth wall by talking to, or simply raising an eyebrow to, the viewer.  While we could never approve of the things \\"F. U.\\" does, it is hard not to love the character, as brought to full-color life by Richardson.  <br />  The only extra given on the DVDs, other than cast biographies, is a short BBC segment discussing the controversy over \\"To Play The King\\", or, to be more specific, over a line which some felt implied that the King used to send out for prostitutes (in context, it clearly does not, it implied he sent out for well-born ladies who would feel it their duty to come).<br />  Each DVD contains four 50 minute episodes, so it is a good buy.<br />Recommended.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Since 1970, we all had to deal with a &quot;non-sense&quot; version of Let It Be -- the version Phil Spector basically &quot;overproduced&quot;.  Yes, it sounded nice and beautiful but what it actually was, was like taking a great hamburger and then seasoning it with honey. <BR>Now finally, we get the real hamburger and how it sould really taste.<br />The Beatles have given us great music and yes, their marketing efforts have laways been top-notch - look at Beatles 1, but this is an album of songs they way the Beatles really sounded.  Now if you don't care about that, fine, but for people who want realism of how four guys made incredible music, this CD cannot be missed.  If you like your dinner sugar-coated, then I'm sorry, you may want to be a Phil Spector fan.  The Beatles were three guitars and drums and that's it...unless you add Billy Preston for two songs.  George Martin did his magic on experimentation along with the boys and that's how masterpieces came about.  Applaud Paul and Ringo for this CD...as well as George who apparently gave his blessing before he left us.  Thanks to Yoko as well.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|While I was more than a little disappointed in both the writing and production values of the first \\"X-Men\\" movie, the sequel more than makes up for the deficiencies of the original.<br />\\"X-Men United\\" lives up to its name: Whereas the original X-Men movie was basically \\"Wolverine, guest-starring some X-Men,\\" the sequel greatly expands the time we spend with the other characters, and all of them are the better for it, including a more compelling vision of Pyro than even the best of the comics has shown us.<br />While the story picks up months after the original, this time, the story is bigger, grander, and more exciting. The film hits the ground running with an amazing sequence introducing the teleporting Nightcrawler, in an eye-popping attack on the Oval Office. Contrast this to the obviously foam rubber girders wrapped around the X-Men at the climax of the last film, and it's immediately obvious that the special effects this time around will be something to enjoy, not something to overlook, and so they are.<br />As always, the acting, particularly by Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellan, is top-notch. The strong central presences of the films' Wolverine and Magneto continue to ground audiences in the larger-than-life world of the X-Men and with the tease in the last few moments of the film egging on comic fans, it'll be too long to wait for the third installment in this series.<br />Recommended for superhero fans, including those who thought the first film didn't live up to its potential.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Let it Be stands up as a great album in this newly released 'as they intended' version, for anyone who might have been concerned about it somehow losing some luster.  Of course, for many Beatles fans it didn't have much 'luster' to begin with.  The title, \\"Let It Be...Naked\\", is quite appropros, as many of the songs are absolutely laid bare here.<br />     First off, most of the 11 songs sound much like they did on the original, in terms of the underlying takes used by Phil Spector to build the monstrosity he eventually produced.  A couple seem to be alternate takes, but, after only a couple of runs through, I'm not yet positive.  One thing I will mention, before I get to the songs, is that I'm not entirely positive about the mix they arrived at...the vocals are far forward and some of the instruments (most noticeable in the little guitar riffs throughout the songs) get a little buried.  The bass is a little on the muddy side as well.  Don't get me wrong, it sounds great...much better than the original...and it actually sounds much better on headphones than in the car (perhaps I need to adjust the equalization in the car).<br />     The lineup is also different, starting with \\"Get Back\\", which sounds much the same, though a little plainer.  On this song, there seems to be something, well, missing.  I'll have to listen to it back-to-back with the 'original'.  The vocal is surprising, being a little more front and center it really shows how interesting a singer Paul could be (he's always PAUL, but he has always tried a little different elements here and there...accents, etc.).  \\"Dig a Pony\\" is next and this one is much like \\"Get Back\\".  I think the original versions of both had more 'background noise' going on, to give them that 'live' feel.  That is absent here, so they sound a little sparse on occasion.  This song holds up better, mainly because there is so much more going on (two separate guitars playing riffs all the way through PLUS the keyboard).  The originalsof these two had no orchestration added, so, again, not TOO different...<br />     \\"For You Blue\\", one of my personal favorites, is VERY different.  On headphones it sounds like 'the boys' are having a jam right there in my head...on speakers it sounds like you are in an intimate room with them and they're just playing a great blues jam.  The song always sounded like a jam, but now it is much, much cleaner...another one to which Spector had artificial background added, I think.  This version is just, well, it's just plain great.  As you'll see later, Harrison seems to have made out the best on this disc.<br />    Now we're getting to the songs that really had a lot of 'work' done to them by Spector.  \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" sounds VERY different.  If you recall, it was always a nice ballad, though somewhat weighed down by the comprehensive orchestration layered on top of it.  Now it sounds like a you are in the smoky lounge of some fantastic club back in the days when such places were 'it'.  The piano work is amazing, and the band is merely there for emphasis on occasion...the whole thing is almost 'cocktail jazz'.  This is the way Billy Joel always heard this song when he listened to it, I bet, because he ripped it off big time.  Oh, and again, Paul shows his range as a vocalist.<br />     \\"Two of Us\\" just sounds great.  On this one, Paul and John's voices ARE the centerpiece, so the mix is quite appropriate.  The song sounds so, well, CLEAN.  It really could be the Everly Brothers.  They are both SO good, and the production shows them off well...the two guitars are separated to each channel but kept back enough that the voices are never overrun.  The bass is in the center, as are the drums (with that great muffled thump that sounds like either a train on the old segmented tracks or a pair of trotting horses), the bass (or is it a low-tuned guitar?) providing the melodic counterpoint.  It's just a great song...these guys could arrange a song better than anybodyever has, or probably ever will (they just constructed their songs so, so, 'right').<br />    \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" is very stripped down compared to the 'original'.  This one actually might be a different take than that one, as the vocals sound quite different in places...especially the backing vocals.  But in other spots there are things that sound EXACTLY the same...could anybody have played that single bent note punctuating the bridge exactly the same way more than once?  Maybe they just moved the backing vocals up in the mix.  Oh, and they definitely lost the extraneous noise that Spector somehow felt substitued for layered instruments to build his \\"wall of sound\\".<br />    \\"One After 909\\" was always a great blues-rock jam, and it's lost nothing here.  It was pretty raw originally, and is so here.  But it's even more fun as they've managed to pull some of the ad libbed comments up from the background...and, again, it's a bit cleaner.  The solo guitar work really screams out at you...in fact, I don't remember the main solo being so long, and I don't remember Billy Preston doing extemporaneous keyboard work during it, but both those elements are here.  Just some good rock and roll...<br />    \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is another one that is much cleaner and far more crisp.  Again, it's hard to enumerate exactly what is different, but it pops much more.  One thing is that Billy Preston's keyboard has become a centerpiece of the song...it ranges throughout the entire length and is more emphasized in the mix.  The bridge is really emphasized in this mix, and sounds very different....Lennon screams \\"It's a love that lasts forever\\" in an amazing, plaintive wail that just reminds you that, with all his amazing talents, he could have been 'merely' a rock singer and he would STILL be a legend.  Preston also has a fabulous keyboard solo over the last 20 seconds that I have no memory of hearing, at least not so crystal clear...great work, too, so I am very glad they decided to enhance it in this mix.<br />    Ah, the other Harrison song...\\"I Me Mine\\".  This song shocked me.  I always loved this song, and wished I could hear it without the lavish orchestration that drowned it.  It's better than I ever imagined it.  George wrote the best stripped-down-4-piece songs of anyone in the band, and it shows here.  You WILL listen to this one over and over and over...listen to the 'big picture', then just the rythym acoustic guitar in the left channel, the counterpoint bass notes on the guitar in the right channel, the sparse organ riffs and chords sprinkled throughout, the low electric guitar buried way deep playing occasional riffs and exploding out for the chorus and, finally, Harrison's pure, soulfull voice bewailing the fall of the world's humanity (OK, he was mostly talking about his bandmates, but it works).  It is just an amazing, incredible song...listen to it on a really good set of headphones, as loud as you can handle it.<br />    \\"Across the Universe\\" is another song which benefits greatly from this new treatment (compared to Spector's mistreatment).  One would think that it would be TOO plain without the orchestration, but it is wonderful...there is sparse and subtle sitar work throughout that complements the melody perfectly.  This song remains the floaty dream that it was, but here it is far more interesting and rewarding.  Lennon's vocal is astounding in its warble-free journey through the upper registers.  His vocal style on this song is so different from some of his other signature songs, like \\"Twist and Shout\\", \\"Imagine\\", \\"Julia\\", etc., that it is hard to accept that it is him...it's almost childlike in its innocence.  <br />    Finally, \\"Let it Be\\".  Another clean and crisp recording.  The first verse is the same, for the most part, and when the chorus comes in during the first, well, chorus, it is far more subdued...it sounds like it's just 'the boys'.  The song still builds up as it goes verse by verse, but without the muddiness of the original (actually, each instrument receives its due here).  Ringo's work is front and center on this song, and it is pin perfect.  Paul's voice is brought forward in the mix and overrides all else, as it should because it is yet another stunning vocal performance from him (his vocal range always astounds me).  This song is one that, once it is over, makes you go \\"Yup, that's the way it should be.\\"<br />    One more thing I should mention and haven't yet is the drum work of Ringo.  The more I revisit my Beatles collection, the more I appreciate his talent.  Perhaps the ultimate compliment to a drummer is that you don't notice him, but I feel it's safe to say most other drummers WOULD be noticed in this band, and not in a good way.  His playing on this album is fantastic, perfectly matched to each song and interesting enough that you could listen to just the drum tracks on most of the songs and be quite satisfied.  I think he's an underrated drummer, perhaps because people forget to put him in the perspective of his time and are wowed by the later exploits of Bonham, Moon, etc.<br />    As with all 'single track' (live) recordings, there are a couple of rough edges.  These would have been removed with multi-tracking but they hadn't wanted to do that on this record originally.  As a result, there are a couple of half-sung words and a little bit of continuity issues with vocal styling...and it's great.  It's so intimate.  <br />    So, why is it that this is SO much better than the Spector-defiled version?  I think much of it has to do with all the little touches that the Beatles added within their songs...and how Spector somehow buried them in his mix of these songs.  It's hard to identify all the things he added to the songs, but all he did was create a \\"wall of mud\\" that buried, what turns out to be, great songs.  Actually, Beatles fans the world over have known they were great songs all along, it was just too frustrating (and a bit depressing) to think about what they could have been.  Now we know.

0679405372|5.0|I just finished Virginia Woolf's TO THE LIGHTHOUSE, and I am not sure what to write about it, except that it's a brilliant, fulfilling read, very rich and layered and nuanced and wonderful. It's a singular work that facilitates new understanding and insight, and makes the point effectively that the drama-rama of the human mind can supercede or at least equal the drama of the world around us.<br />The Ramsay family is the center of the story, and it is at their home in the Hebrides that the first section takes place, &quot;The Window.&quot; In fact, this section, which covers only part of a day in time, comprises 125 pages of the 209-page book. In a way similar to that of MRS. DALLOWAY, Woolf switches the perspective among the Ramsay family and some of their guests, Lily, an indepedent single woman, the Ramsay children, and Charles Tansley, a student of Mr. Ramsay, a philosopher.<br />There are threads of the issue of femininity in the book. What do the differing ways in which Mrs. Ramsay, mother of eight and supportive wife, and Lily, single woman, painter, enact their feminity mean? How do they deal with and understand and love each other? What forces do they unleash on each other?<br />The book deals skillfully with the perception of the passage of time, as &quot;The Window&quot; deals with that short bit, focusing, I found, the book's most amazing and engaging section on the dinner party that night. The second section, &quot;Time Passes,&quot; is merely 20 pages, but covers ten years, and the final section, &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; is one morning. There are all kinds of<br />reminders of the fluidity of time in the text, a skull of an animal on the wall in the children's nursery that causes them to be unable to sleep, as well as Mrs. Ramsay's glance back into the dining room at the end of the party and her realization that the success of the evening, which was somewhat hard won, is ephemeral and over, already in the past.<br />The second section has a different view of time, almost looking at the house from nature's point of view as time ravages the house through the war when the family isn't using it. It's very meditative. Major events in the lives of the people who attended the dinner are enclosed in brackets, as side notes, for the passage of time and the entropy that ensues is the major drama here. We see the lives and deaths of the characters as small things, part of a greater cycle that winds on and on in a more eternal, less fleeting, way.<br />What Woolf begins in the first section, she deals with more strongly in the third, I think, and that is that the validity of each person's differing perception of the others is equal. Two of the Ramsay children, James and Cam, go with their father and a fisherman and his boy to the lighthouse in the sailboat. James despises his father, while Cam sees his weaknesses and loves him for his vulnerabilities. She knows how James feels and feels drawn to protect James, too, but she knows a different father than James does.<br />I think that was what struck me the most about the book, the way the characters' combined perceptions assemble a greater truth and understanding than each of them singly has.<br />Woolf has a great insight and beautifully descriptive and engaging way of writing about thought as dramatic and intimate. Woolf writes about such things, the pleasure of picking up a pleasant and soothing thought so elegantly, that it doesn't seem to be writing on a page, but access to another's mind, and the part of the truth he or she holds.<br />And overall the writing is simply stunning.<br />In the first section, one of the characters loses a brooch on the beach, and they discuss going back to look for it the next day. By the time the book ends, the lost brooch seems so far away, in some deep and distant memory. I think this one detail is a mark of the beauty and success of the book.view of time, almost looking at the house from nature's point of view as time ravages the house through the war when the family isn't using it.

Ed and the boyz really know how to put it together.  By the way, Stone is the best drummer on the planet!!! This CD certainly doesn't GREMMIE OUT OF CONTROL. For now, I'll be LEAVIN' HERE.  The hidden bonus track floored me, as if thirty blockbusting tracks weren't enough (WOW-WEE)!!! The only thing I wish was added to this collection was the single MANSOOR E RAMSOOR, a very rare track, I believe, from one of their fan club EP's.<br />PJ 4 PREZ... I'm a democrat by the way.

B0000DJZA5|4.0|First, the title is stupid.  \\"Get Back\\"--the original title for the sessions that became \\"Let It Be\\"--would have been better and less goofy, or perhaps \\"The Get Back Sessions\\" except that would be misleading.<br />Second, everything here will be familiar; this is NOT a new recording and it is NOT hard to tell where Phil Spector grafted things onto the various songs.  Don't go in expecting a revelation along the lines of, \\"Ah, so this is what they recorded!\\"  If you've ever seen Paul McCartney in concert or listened to his live albums, especially Wings Over America, then you already have a pretty good idea of what \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" sounds like on this album.  If you have the Beatles' Past Masters Volume Two, then you've heard the recording of \\"Across the Universe\\" that is on here (except that they removed the bird sounds).  Actually, \\"Long and Winding Road\\" is the same recording used on the original Let It Be album--Spector just slowed it down and added a choir and orchestra.  \\"Across the Universe\\" is the same recording on all THREE albums (Let It Be, Past Masters Two, and this album).  Thus, it will all sound familiar.<br />Is this bad?  No, of course not.  There is some very good music here.  \\"Two of Us\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" are two of my favorites and they aren't all that different on this album.  The most jarring things on this album are (1) the inclusion of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" (which, I think, belongs here as it and \\"Get Back\\" were probably two of the songs they focused on the most in the sessions) and (2) the omission of the studio chatter (which is striking because we've heard it for so many years).  The chatter was sort of dumb to include, but elements of it had become part of Let It Be.  \\"Two of Us\\" without the Lennon intro is weird at first.<br />So, is this indispensable?  No, absolutely not.  Is it a good listen?  Yes, and the version of \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" while hardly anything truly new in view of McCartney's live albums, is worthy.<br />The second CD is a total throwaway.  Waste of time.  There is supposedly a full five-minute \\"Dig It\\" floating around somewhere in the session tapes.  That would have been more interesting than the flotsam and jetsam thrown in on the extra disc.  The real album is disc one.
B000089RVR|3.0|A good record, but if you already own the first one, don't bother with this, it's almost a duplicate.  Sorry Dido, I like you, but I expected a little more.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|In my opinion, I think we all need to get a grip and relise that girls become women, such as Britney.  She is an artist just like Madonna and she will express herself in many ways.  She is on a journey and we get to watch since she is famous.  Madonna did the same thing and we all gasp, but ultimately Madonna has her fan base and so will Britney.<br />This album has great dance music, I'm certain they will play it in many dance clubs.  I think the little girls have lost interest because they can no longer relate to her, young women can since they are at similar stages.  I think the album is a great pieace of Britney's expressions as she &quot;grows up&quot;.  I hope she finds her spot in the ground and continues to blum every year.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I HEARD WHITNEY'S NEW C.D. AND SHE IS SINGING DIRECTLY FROM THE HEART. HER VOICE IS STRONG, DEEP AND RICH AND STILL AMAZINGLY POWERFUL. MY FAVORITE IS THE SEMI ACAPELLA TUNE TRACK#9 &quot;O'COME, O'COME EMANUEL&quot; WHERE SHE DIGS TO HER ROOTS, AND SING DOWN HOME WITH SUCH AN AGGRESIVE GOSPEL FEEL, IS THE ICING ON THE CAKE. <BR>WHITNEY CONTINUES TO SHOW WITH HER VOICE. THAT SHE STILL HAS SOME OLD AND NEW TRICKS THAT CAN STILL MAKES YOU QUIVER AND HUNGRY FOR MORE.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Hey Britney U say u wanna loose control!!! Dang ya'll this cd is soooooooooooooooo hott its a party dance cd i luv it luv it luv it its soooooo banging i waz always a britney fan from baby one more time i have all her cds and she is getting better..don't mind the hater's out there she's not a kid n e more she could do what she likes and i luv this cd ya'll should get IT!!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is truly amazing! With every release of a new album Britney's music just keeps getting better and better. Her first single with Madonna is just a glimpse of how great this album is. Everybody is saything that this album is too sexy; however, if Britney had kept doing songs like Baby One More Time and Oops!...I Did It Again it would very boring after a while hearing the same thing again. I absolutly love Britney and her music and i love the direction she is going in. She will be around for a LONG time! This album is for ANY Britney fan or for just any one who likes this style. ROCK ON BRITNEY!!!!!!
B000002WPI|5.0|Im from shaolin and 36 chambers is what got me into rap. 36 chambers is the type cd that u just let play because every track is hot. Easily the best cd ever made from the best rap group of our time.
630463949X|5.0|I highly recommend this item for Fleetwood Mac fans! It is the best! The quality is exceptional! I am a massive Fleetwood Mac fan and not once has this item disappointed me! You’ll want to watch it again and again! The charming Miss Stevie Nicks vocals are gorgeous as always! Lindsey Buckingham rocks the house like none other! Christine McVie is better than ever! In addition, almost all the hits are played! “Rhiannon”, “Dreams”, “Landslide”, “Silver Springs”, “Gypsy”, “Gold Dust Woman”, “You Make Loving Fun”, and who could forget “Tusk” or “The Chain” plus many other great songs! One of the most outstanding Fleetwood Mac performances recorded!
B000089RVX|4.0|This is the band I've been waiting for. Whatever happened to good rock? Evanescence will answer that question for you. The songs are full of emotion and the dark, moody and beautiful voice of Amy brings them home. She's definately my new favorite vocalist and this disk has not left my CD player since I got it.<BR>Don't go by the single, although I thought it a decent song the rest of the tracks have something special that the single doesn't.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Wow! Britney's new album, \\"In the Zone\\" is simply amazing! It is totally different than anything Britney has ever done, but yet die hard Britney fans are still going to love it! This album really showcases Britney's songwriting and her new perspectives on life....in other words Britney is all grown up!  1. Me Against the Music- If you love this song, you will like the album. Such a fun song to dance to! Dance off anyone?  2. I Got That Boom Boom- Awesome beat! I can't wait till they start playing this song at clubs.  3. Showdown- A bit slower than some of the other songs, but still has a great beat.   4. Breathe on Me- My favourite song on the album. I think it is worth buying for this song alone.  5. Early Mornin'- In Rolling Stone Magazine Britney said this was her favourite song on the album. It's a fun song with an awesome groove. Moby co-wrote and produced it.  6. Toxic- This song has a James Bond vibe to it. I love the chorus.  7. Outrageous- This song would be great to dance to but I think it is one of the weaker songs on the album. It was written and produced by R Kelly.  8. Touch of My Hand- This is song is the most sexual on the album...not suitable for younger Britney fans! But hey- you gotta give the girl some credit for putting such a forward song on her album. The song does have a cool Eastern vibe to it.  9. The Hook Up- Good dancing song with a touch of reggae. Kind of reminds me of Gwen Stefani.  10. Shadow- This is my least favourite song on the album. It is quite slow and just kind of boring.  11. Brave New Girl- Britney does Madonna proud with Brave New Girl. In fact I could swear Madonna is singing the bridge! Funky song.  12. Everytime- Another slow song, but this one is beautiful. I think this song really demonstrates what an amazing song writer Britney can be. It is a really touching song.  13. Me Against the Music Remix- So fun! Just as good as the original and even better to dance to!   Overall Britney did a stand up job on her new album. While there is trace of classic Britney songs, her new style has class, talent and groove. Any Briney fan will love this album and if you aren't a Britney fan you should give it a try. I think Miss Spears will surprise you!
B00006G8LB|3.0|This was a very visually engossing film, and on the whole, enjoyable. I would have preferred to have seen some more plot and character developement though as this would have really made this movie come 'alive'!
0156027321|5.0|It's brilliant. It's fantastic. I already have a list of people who will be getting this book as a chiristmas gift. Sure call me unoriginal, but read the book you'll understand. It is both subtle and smart and at the same time impossible to put down.
B00009TB5G|5.0|At last we have the extended edition of The Two Towers. It was certainly worth the wait. Those of us who bought the extended version of Fellowship of the Ring know what to expect. A superior, richer version of the film and enough bonus features for ten movies. And that's exactly what we get. The extended version of The Two Towers improves on an already great film. The difference is not huge, but fans of the book will certainly appreciate the added detail. Most appreciated, in my opinion, is the extended finale which I think works much better than the abbreviated end of the theatrical film. The events following the Battle of Helm's Deep are greatly fleshed out in this version. I also loved the new scene with Merry and Pippin discovering Saruman's storehouse at Isengard. I loved all the new and extended scenes, and feel that the story is greatly enriched by them. <br />Obviously, the extended version is going to be the one to own for fans, but it's good that the theatrical version is available also. Casual viewers may find the film's 223-minute running time a bit daunting. However, if you watch it in two parts, it's not difficult at all to sit through. For anyone who loves these films, the Extended Edition is an essential purchase. These are quite simply the most comprehensive DVD collections that have ever been produced. The films, Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers are among the finest of this generation. Return of the King will no doubt be the same.
B00005JMFR|1.0|Matrix Revolution shows not only accepted diminishing artistic <BR>return, but in view of the first Matrix movie an even greater downfall. Matrix set up an ongoing phantasy that would only have been sustained by an equally good story line photography and inventive action. Not so, Matrix Revolution capitalizes on action scenes already proved in Matrix and the story line comes too close to the Dune Machine Crusade and neither resolves nor enlightens the conflict. I expected much more and had faith in the film makers here, who are not the Hollywood standard, but still fell victim to their earlier success.<BR>The actor's emphasis on performing their own stunts did not improve the story, neither did the change in characters, i.e. the oracle and crew. <BR>The machine war was visually interesting, had it not been exploited in length and repetition. <BR>The failure is the story line and resolution.
B000002MU3|2.0|Coming into this album, REM were on a roll. They'd consolidated their fan base with the very good poppy &quot;Out of Time&quot;, then become possibly the biggest band in the world for a few minutes with the excellent &quot;Automatic For the People&quot;, a rare case where critical and commercial mass intersected. Then came Monster.<br />Given the continued artistic integrity of the band, one could interpret this as an intentional attempt to fight any expectations that may have been set up by Automatic. Surely, it would have been difficult to top Automatic. Surely, artistic integrity and the band's internal pride wouldn't let them simply make &quot;Automatic Jr.&quot; But instead we got this? A noisy rocking record who's greatest attribute is that it is...rocking? Too bad they didn't have enough other ideas, like interesting melodies, to accompany the rocking.<br />There's not a single track on this album that would rate in R.E.M's top 25 on a good day. The best of the bad lot are probably the two singles &quot;What's the Frequency Kenneth&quot; and &quot;Bang and Blame&quot;. Those are B-level tracks by the standards of lesser groups, but no better than C+ for a group like R.E.M.<br />The real shame of this album isn't that it's so lousy compared to anything else in the R.E.M. catalogue. No, the real shame is that this album managed to alienate a good portion of the audience that R.E.M. managed to win all their previous steller efforts. That means that way too few people heard really worthwhile subsequent efforts like &quot;New Adventures in Hi Fi&quot;, &quot;Up&quot; and (especially) &quot;Reveal&quot;.<br />And that's a shame.<br />Blame it on the Monster.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|&quot;As I Am&quot; may be the the epitomy of metal songwriting and playing. Hard, fast, gripping, powerful, and if you don't read the lyrics and sing along with Mr. LaBrie you are missing half the fun. WOW.<br />I'm a person who bought Joe Satriani's &quot;Surfing with the Alien&quot; before I had ever heard Joe play a single note, thinking that anyone who put the Silver Surfer on their album cover had to be good--and the first notes I heard, I knew he was something special. DT is like that, and when &quot;As I Am&quot; comes at you and you -hear- it, you'll know what I mean.<br />As for the rest of the CD, it's Dream Theater showing us the incredible range, unbelievable teamwork and radical change-making ability that has no equal. BUY IT!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|If Britney thinks her songs are going to be forever played on the radio like Madonna's hit classics, she needs to wake up.  What is up with the song &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;?  Did Madonna influence her that much to electronize her voice since Madonna did it in her &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;American Life&quot; album. It's so irritating! Britney lied again.  This album will still trap her as a lip-synching bubblegum pop airhead...&quot;Umm what is Hinduism? Is that like Kabbalah or somethin'?&quot;...have you all seen how she is like in interviews...freakin' this and that. Since Christina successfully reininvent herself, Britney is desperately trying to do the same thing by appearing half nude in magazine covers.  Bet Hugh Hefner is calling her everyday!  If you want an album that does affectively reach people, get Christina's album &quot;Stripped&quot;...her voice is emotionally real and her songs are more open and honest.  I can already imagine if this album fails, Britney would next hire people to write songs about being abused and have a voice coach teaching her how to put &quot;real&quot; emotions in her thin strained voice.

B0000DJZA5|4.0|By now, most everyone knows the story: Near the end of their career, The Beatles plan to record a set sessions wherein they 'get back' to the rootsier, less produced aspects of their music that have been long left behind. Unfortunately, the group is close to breaking up and the resulting acrimonious sessions, all captured on audio and video tape, are a mess. No one within the Beatles' camp has the energy or inclination to do anything with the resulting zillions of hours of tape, so they're turned over to outside producers, first Glyn Johns, then later Phil Spector. Both producers manage to cobble together a decent album from the tapes, but only Spector's gets released. (Johns' effort came close but got cancelled at the last minute).<br />The two versions of the album (Johns' and Spector's) differ in a few minor songs, but the biggest difference between the albums that Johns and Spector produced was that Spector added a swell of strings and other instruments to three songs: The Long and Winding Road, Across the Universe and I Me Mine. The changes to the former two are significant because these represent two of the better songs in the Beatles' estimable canon. The latter song is a rather minor Harrison contribution.<br />At any rate, since the album was first released there has been dissention in the former Beatles' ranks, most notably from Paul McCartney, about the album that came out. The complaints have mainly concerned the assertion that Spector's polished version doesn't represent the 'back to basics' aesthetic the Beatles were supposedly striving for in these sessions.<br />So what we have here, then, is supposedly an attempt to rectify that situation. This is supposed to be the 'raw' version of the Let It Be sessions, without Spector's sweetening. Does it work and is it really a revelation? Kind of, and not really.<br />In a nutshell, here's what the new release of Let It Be has done relative to the older version: 1) Considerable added production elements have been stripped from The Long and Winding Road, Across the Universe and I Me Mine; 2) Two short filler songs from the first release have been removed (Dig It and Maggie Mae) and replaced by the far superior track Don't Let Me Down; 3) The between-song patter has been removed. (&quot;Hope We Passed the Audition&quot;, &quot;here's hark the Herald Angels come&quot;); 4) The track order has been significantly altererd. There are modest changes to the other songs, but the meat of the changes is in (1)-(4) above.<br />OK, let's evaluate these changes one at a time:<br />1) The string-less Long and Winding Road is more intimate. But contrary to Paul's claims (and, heck, contrary to the version Paul did for his early '80s Give My Regards to Broad Street) the Spector strings do, arguably, enhance the track. It's a toss up. Across the Universe does sound better in the non-Spector version, although honestly it's not revalatory. And the non-Spector version of I Me Mine is inferior. Note that the no-string version of the Long and Winding road here is a different take than the one that appeared on Volume 3 of the Beatles Anthology.<br />2)The filler is not missed in terms of songs, but did actually serve a purpose in terms of reflecting the fragmented ramshackel nature of the sessions. It's nice to get Don't Let Me Down.<br />3) The between song patter is sorely missed. As with the filler songs, it added a greater sense of the true nature of the sessions.<br />4) The track reordering doesn't really mean much.<br />The bottom line is that the new album, while stripping away a lot of added production elements, also strips away a lot of the CHARACTER of the album by removing the silly ditties and between song patter. Although this is being marketed as the definitive reflection of the Beatles' original wishes, I would argue that, despite the Spector florishes, the original release is more reflective of what actually went on at the sessions.<br />There are some great songs on here, ineither version, and there's nothing inherently wrong with this new version. But it seems somehow ironic that this supposed definitive version is in some ways more cleaned up and LESS representative of the greater truth.<br />For my money, I think that while this is an interesting album, and surely worth having for completists or anyone hungry for ANYTHING new by the Beatles, the original release beats this one. I believe a better distillation of the sessions could be made that beats either album. But I don't know if we'll ever see that.her version, and there's nothing inherently wrong with this new version.

B0000VCZK2|2.0|The film was released at 2.35:1, and the previous DVD release kept the original aspect ratio. Since all the other films in this box set keep the OAR of the other films, why change Alien? Can't say I'm particularly excited by this as alien 3 and Alien Resurrection sucked. I might buy Aliens, but I'm certainly not going to blow $70 for the one or two films I care about. JMO. --M

0486282112|5.0|Modern readers must jump through a number of hoops to enjoy this legendary novel.  Written between 1816 and 1818, this is very much a novel of its era, and both language and ideas about plot are quite different from those of today.  That aside, and unlike such contemporaries as Jane Austen, author Mary Shelly has never been greatly admired for her literary style, which is often awkward.  But perhaps the biggest hurdle is that of our own expectations: while it certainly sent icy chills down the spines of 19th Century readers, FRANKENSTEIN is not a horror novel per se.<br /><br />While Mary Shelly might have been stylistically weak, her story was not.  Nothing like it had been written before, and the concept of a student endowing life upon a humanoid creature cobbled together from charnel house parts was unexpectedly shocking to the reading public.  But even more shocking were the ideas that Shelly brought to the story.  Having created this thing in his own image, what--if anything--does the creator owe it?  And in posing this question, Shelly very deliberately raises her novel to an even more complex level: this is not merely the conflict of man and his creation, but also a questioning of God and his responsibility toward his creation.<br /><br />In some respects, the book is written like the famous philosophical \\"dialogues\\" of the ancient world: a counterpoint of questions and arguments that do battle for the reader's acceptance.  More than anything else, FRANKENSTEIN is a novel of ethics and of ideas about ideas, with Mary Shelly's themes arrayed in multiple layers throughout: God, self, society, science; responsibility to self, to society, to the things we bring to society, to the truth; life, integrity, and death--these are the ideas and issues that predominate the book, and any one expecting a horror novel pure and simple is out of luck.<br />Mary Shelly is a rare example of a writer whose ideas clearly outstrip her literary skill--but whose ideas are so powerful that they transcend her literary limitations and continue to resonate today.  And indeed, as science continues to advance, it could not be otherwise so.  Mary Shelly could not see into the future of DNA research, laboratory-grown tissues, test-tube babies and the like--but between 1816 and 1818 she wrote a book about the ethical dilemmas that swirl around them.  And for all its flaws, FRANKENSTEIN is perhaps even more relevant today than it was over a hundred and fifty years ago.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerl that they transcend her literary limitations and continue to resonate today.

B00005QZWI|5.0|I think part of what makes the Lord of the Rings movies work so brilliantly is the magnificent score.  The music underlines the scenes and sets the tone so well.  All pieces were Composed and conducted by Howard Shore and Performed by New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, except for the poignant parting song May It Be composed and performed by Enya.<br />From the &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; which is so whimsical and bright, it moves through to &quot;The Treason of Isengard&quot;, giving you the sweeping fear of the shadow moving across the land, growing increasing darker and more urgent.  &quot;the Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; is so poingant, and Enya's closing tune the pefect touch of sadness and hope.<br />That Shore did all the Rings' soundtracks, kept the movie's so consistent and of a single mind.  The Movies and brilliant and Shore magic is a part of that.<br />I rank this up with Braveheart as one of the best soundtracks ever.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a fan of other works by the creator, Joss Whedon, like Angel and Buffy, but when I heard he was making a space western, I said \\"meh, sounds dull.\\" So I never saw it, it was cancelled and I never knew. Months later a friend encouraged me to watch it. I was bored enough to do exactly that. And it was great. The writing, the realistic plot, and especially the comedy is excellent. Too bad Fox never gave it a chance. Buy the DVD and help Firefly.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I dont have an ellobrate review about this CD but the fact I normally listen to things like Korn - Paul Van Dyk - Outkast should show you something about this CD and the fact it got a response out of me.  I have held the deepest respect for Sarah Mclachlan's music for the longest time.  I have read a couple reviews that really did this album no justice what so ever.  It is incredible!  It is one of those albums that you can listen to when your down, totally in love, or just wanting to clear your head when things seem fuzzy.   I have to admit I would get smacked in the head for this review by my friends, but it's worth it.  Take the time to actually listen to the words - there is a couple songs that will really make you think.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Like many hard-core Bruce fans, I got this mainly for the bonus disc. Although I knew the compilation would be good of course, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it works in telling Bruce's continuing story about what it means to be an American.  Although Disc 1 is great, I was more impressed by Disc 2 which opens with the disillusion of &quot;Born in the USA&quot; and ends with the optimism of&quot;Land of Hopes and Dreams&quot; and deals directly with this idea in very different ways from personal loss and fulfillment in &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot; and &quot;Lucky Town&quot; through the disenfranchisement found in &quot;Streets of Philadelphia, &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad,&quot; and &quot;41 Shots&quot; mixed with belief in the American Dream as shown through the &quot;The Rising&quot; and &quot;Land.&quot;  Very powerful stuff, even for diehards who have loved these songs for many years.<br />In my view, Springsteen has moved beyond just being a rock artist and entered the American literary tradition represented by Emerson, Whitman, Twain, Frank Capra, John Ford, Steinbeck, and Dylan.  It's irrelevant as to whether he has &quot;hits&quot; anymore or is &quot;in anymore, because he is much more significant than that.  A hundred years from now people will still be listening to &quot;The Promised Land&quot; and &quot;The River&quot; to find out what America really means.<br />If you don't have anything by Springsteen, this is a good place to start.  If you have everything, it's a good place to renew and reinforce your friendship with this great American artist who continues to define who we really are.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I was pretty skepticle reguarding this album and its originality. But, having now listened to it, I'm amazed. If you close your eyes, John, Paul, George and Ringo are right there in the room with you. Wonderful and Refreshing.

B0000E1WKE|4.0|Being a fan of Whitney Houston nearly my whole life, I have always wanted a Christmas album from her.  However, as time went on, doubts entered my mind if she would be able to accomplish such a task.  Once I heard she was recording a Christmas LP, I was worried that the album would be rushed and have production and vocal quality like her previous album, Just Whitney.  To my delight, One Wish is just the opposite of Just Whitney.  It is definately a big step forward, but it is not competely up to par with The Preachers Wife.  Her voice has improved greatly, and the production is excellent (with some exceptions).  Favorite tracks are The Christmas Song, Little Drummer Boy, Deck The Halls / Silent Night, I'll Be Home For Christmas, O Come O Come Emanuel, and from 1996's Preachers Wife: Who Would Imagine A King.  There are some down sides to the album /First Noel and O Holy Night/ but those are the only exceptions.
B00009W0U4|3.0|This film is a teeming, glittering, sinuous ode to rape. It prettifies it, portraying the infamous offending piece cinema in womb like reds- this is not any attempt at graphic realism. This is definately not any kind of indictment of it, as some people have (stretching an interpretation or two) stated that it is. The 2001: A Space Odyssey intertext is unfortunately trite- was it a dream? Literally undoing a crime?- puhleeze- that's not insight, no 'poetic vision'. The film itself is a myopic, it does not reveal anything 'deep' (the reverse film artifice is SOOO obvious as to seem wholly gimmicky). That is what is fascinating about it. The charge and energy of an obvious exploitation film- unapologetic. To understand (some) people's fascination with cinema of the excessive, look no further than this. Fascinating in it's absolute lack of depth and breadth.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|If someone got so far as to read this, I will follow the line of comments of The End 1 and 2. To me, this is probably the worst DT release ever, only comparable to 6doit.<br />If I liked DT from the very beginning (I&amp;A, Awake) is because although their compositions were complex, there was a line behind each song that joined the pieces together, and there were tons of work to achieve this. There were mood changes, variety and good taste. All of this is gone.<br />As a friend said, all songs of ToT sound pretty much the same, parts can be interchanged no one would notice.<br />Petrucci used to play great, every solo would be different and fitting perfectly in the song. His solos along the album are ridiculous and sound al the same. He´s laughing at us!!!!<br />This CD forgets all these thins that were so valuable in the past and they start a race where all that matters is speed and volume set to 10.<br />The production does not help, it´s nothing compared to previous CDs, dirty and unclear.<br />Hope they will notice that this is the wrong direction.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|The Beatles - a common household name, a respected band, and pioneers of a sound. A sound which was perfected, for the final time, with &quot;Let it Be - Naked&quot;.<br />Spector is gone. Yoko is gone. All other outside influences who felt they could control the artistic ability of The Beatles and even do better are gone. All thats left is Sir Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, and the souls of John Lennon and George Harrison for one last time. <br />&quot;The way it was meant to be heard&quot; is apparent in the first song.  I can't come here and review Beatles songs because they are timeless classics. These are not new material, these are old ideas applied to old songs. Nevertheless, a few key songs:<br />&quot;Get Back&quot;<BR>Whats changed? This is the &quot;shortened&quot; version, where ever Beatles fan is expecting the song to go on and getting nothing but track number 2. I think McCartney did well with this: while not a complete change in sound, its the change in the way the music was laid out, and its enough difference to note.<br />&quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;<BR>My ONLY complaint on this album comes in the form of this song. I believe they removed the charm from it, adding in a lacking guitar (perhaps an organ too?) that doesnt make up for what it was before. Something sounds off about this.<br />&quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;<BR>Perhaps my favorite of the re-released tracks is &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;. This IS the way it was meant to be heard, and this can be most apparently heard in the wonderful backing sounds of the organ that climaxes with a solo of sorts near the end of the song. The only word I could say is majestic, because thats what it is. McCartney and friends did right with this one.<br />&quot;Across the Universe&quot;<BR>Simply put, this is stripped of all the bells and whistles that machines of the day could produce, leaving us with John Lennons raw, enchanting voice. Its all we need now, and its all we should of gotten before.<br/>&quot;Let It Be&quot;<BR>The final song of the first CD, and rightfully so, this is the gem of this album. While nearly nothing has changed, it is the song itself that remains a classic and remains a testament to what was, and what passed. With a wonderful guitar solo to guide us through the middle of the melody, this song gives us the sense that we can finally &quot;Let It Be&quot;.<br />The second CD is a rare listen into Beatles studio life. Its an interesting listen, but nothing I could see myself listening to on a regular basis.<br />The Beatles, even after 33 years, still know how to do it right, and they did it right with &quot;Let it Be - Naked&quot;. Any Beatles fan, young or old, should appreciate this album. However sad it may be, an era has ended, but the soul of the music will live on forever.
0385504209|5.0|The imagery that Dan Brown conjures up is quite vivid throughout the entire novel.<br />I commend the author for helping people to awaken to other customs, rituals, belief systems and hierarchy within organizations.<br />From 8-NOV through 23-NOV, celestial bodies will form the Magen David above the planet Earth.  This symbol is discussed in detail, throughout the novel.  I wonder if the author is trying to help people understand that the &quot;Star of David&quot; is not just for the Jewish people.  Dan Brown references this symbol being used by the ancients before Judaism.<br />The subtle reference to the 325A.D. conference of priests and the casting out of certain Divine Teachings (like reincarnation) was thoughtful, historically accurate, and might help Catholic Christians better understand the levels of hell.<br />I very much enjoyed this.  What's next, Dan Brown?
B0000E1WKE|1.0|Mariah Carey released a great Christmas collection years ago and I saw that Whitney now had her turn at it! It was a turn in the wrong direction! This album is nothing I thought it would be, Whitney tries to sound like her old self but struggles, resulting in a hoarse belt at the end of O Holy Night (which is a very boring and uninspiring rendition.) <BR>I say save your money and purchase Mariah Carey's 'Merry Christmas', it's full of traditional sounding Christmas songs that put a smile on your face, not make you cringe.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|I recommend this for any live DVD fan.  It sounds soooooo good (even if parts are overdubbed) and looks awesome.  The better your sound system, the more you'll enjoy it.
B000001EHS|4.0|I'll go through the songs one by one.<BR>1.  Pour some sugar on me- A fun song that is a favorite of mine and many other people.  It's what got me interested in the band.<BR>2.  Photograph- A bit of a letdown after the first song, but still very good.<BR>3.  Love bites- starts off too slow, but I like the tune of the chorus.<BR>4.  Let's get rocked- Reminds me of when my dad made me do chores in the morning during the summer.  Another upbeat song.<BR>5.  Two steps behind- Nowadays, those sorta lyrics would mean a title of &quot;stalker&quot;, but whatever.  It's a girl's song, so I'm not one to judge.<BR>6.  Animal- It always just slowly draws me in.  My head is always bobbing by the end of the song.  Top 4 on the CD, at least.<BR>7.  Foolin'- Definitely the best song on here.  I tend to lean towards harder rocking songs, and this fits the bill.<BR>8.  Rocket- An energetic song.  It takes a little bit of time to get used to it.  Middle of the pack for the CD.<BR>9.  When love and hate collide- What?  Did I accidentally put in my sister's Backstreet Boys CD?  Sheesh.  Maybe this was their inspiration.<BR>10.  Armageddon it- The guitar solo is great.<BR>11.  Have you ever needed someone so bad- I first got this CD when I was going through a situation that fit the lyrics just about perfectly, so I look past the lacking areas.<BR>12.  Rock of ages- I think that the big bad guy in the Highlander movie had quoted directly from the beginning of this song.  Good choice.  I think it could have also been named &quot;pyromania.&quot;<BR>13.  Hysteria- Smooth-flowing song.  Kind of hypnotic.<BR>14.  Miss you in a heartbeat- Like &quot;Two Steps Behind,&quot; this one wasn't intended for listeners like me, so I'll let it slide.  Some parts definitely took talent to create.<BR>15.  Bringin' on the heartbreak- Has just the right balance to express the sorrow the song is about, but without being a depressing song.<BR>Overall, this is a good CD.  It's not one that I can just pop inthe CD player and listen straight through every song, but its got some of my favorite songs.  After reading the inside cover of the CD jewel, I came to believe that the band members themselves didn't really like the soft ballad songs that much, but the ladies did, and that's important too!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is an incredible album. The main thing that stands out for me are Britney's vocals. They are absolutely amazing...you have not heard what Britney has to offer to the world until you have heard this album. <br />Yes, I am Britney fan but I can say what is good and what is bad. You won't be seeing \\"BRITNEY IS PERFECT! IT'S ALL GREAT!!!!!\\" from me. This review is my honest evaluation of this album for its music. <br />By the way, Britney co-write seven of the twelve songs. <br />Now onto the songs! <br />1. Me Against the Music featuring Madonna <BR>This is a good dance track, with fast beats. The presence of Madonna adds nicely to the track (where Britney and Madonna sing together), though I am not that fond of her speaking parts. All my people on the floor, let me see you dance -- this track definitely makes you do that <br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom featuring the Ying Yang Twins <BR>I heard this song for the first time when Britney performed it on TRL on November 10th. At the beginning, the twins came out and becoming rapping. I was thinking...what is going on?! Finally, Britney came and began singing. <br />I really like this song. The beats and Britney's vocals are really good. <br />The thing I dislike about this song are the Ying Yang Twins. I despise the parts of the song that they participate in. Don't get me wrong -- I can appreciate this type of music -- but all their random noises and their overall feel in this song are awful. I really think they shouldn't have been in this track. However, as harsh as it may seem, I simply ignore their presence in this song and focus on the parts where Britney is present and it turns into a really good song. <br />The banjo rocks! It's very cool to see Britney singing this type of music...it really worked for her. <br />3. Showdown <BR>Not my favorite track from the album but it is still okay. I think it could have been better -- I'm not really digging the beats and overall rhythm. However, toward the middle, it getsreally good! I like that part. <br />This is my least favorite track from the album but I like all the songs and thus, saying that a song is my least favorite isn't saying too much bad about the song. <br />4. Breathe On Me <BR>Ooh...it's so hot in here and I need some air! I really like this song. This song has a Kylie Minogue feel to it. It is very cool to see Britney be daring, attempting something different, vocally-wise, than what she normally does. Props for her because it works! At the end, instead of saying the word \\"breathe,\\" she just breathes...I thought this was a very cute touch. Very sensual song. <br />5. Early Mornin' <BR>You can definitely feel Moby in this song. When I first started typing a review for this song, I began by saying \\"the vocals could have been stronger.\\" However, I gave the song another listen. I no longer feel this way. The song talks about the night after partying and all...the way it is sung and was produced fits perfectly with the subject matter of the song. Britney also adds some spice to her voice that makes this song really nice to listen to. The talking part toward the end of the song...very good part that goes perfectly with the subject of the song as well. <br />6. Toxic <BR>My favorite track from the album! This is a semi-fast-paced, FUN song! Great vocals and beats with some playing around (in both categories). I can just totally picture myself blasting this song in my car when I'm on my road trip this summer! <br />7. Outrageous <BR>...when I move my body! I like the repetition of the word Outrageous in this song. Again, the vocals are really good. Britney shows that she is definitely not a girl anymore! R Kelly did a nice job with the song. I just wanna be happy in a place where love is free! Can you take me there? Somebody? <br />8. Touch of My Hand <BR>I will be bold...going to the places I can be out of control! The subject matter, of course, is masterbation. However, it is done very appropriately...so much to be oneof my favorite tracks. The vocals, once again!, are very nicely. This song probably has the instrumentals/tunes that I like the most out of any song. Very soothing and calming. I love myself -- it's not a sin. <br />9. The Hook Up <BR>Another fun track with a reggae feel to it. This song's catchy beats will make you grab someone and begin dancing! I especially like the middle part of this song. Britney, once again, attempted something different and it worked really nicely. <br />10. Shadow <BR>Can you say best.vocals.ever.? WOW! This is a gorgeous song. Britney really gives it her all and hits it perfectly. The vocals are incredible and it's a very soothing song. I love this song! I hope it is a single. <br />11. Brave New Girl <BR>Another fun song! I really like these fun songs on this album -- it gives the album a lot of variety. I agree with another reviewer on that it is a \\"cute, empowering\\" song -- definitely! However, I really like the bubbly, happy feeling to this song. This another song I can picture myself blasting in my car on my road trip in the summer! <br />12. Everytime <BR>Why are we strangers when our love is strong? Why carry on without me? Every time I try to fly, I fall...without my wings, I feel so small. I guess I need you, baby... Another song with really nice vocals. I think that there could been a little less music and a little more Britney -- this could have made it stronger. However, it's still a great track -- very good! <br />13. Me Against the Music -- (Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix <BR>This is just a remix of the first track on this album. It has Middle Eastern influences that work really nicely with the song -- nice remix! <br />My Final Thoughts <br />There were a few tracks I disliked on ...Baby One More Time, Oops!...I Did it Again, and even a couple on Britney. I can honestly say that all songs on In the Zone are incredible and you will love this album! Music lovers of all genres will find something for them here. <br />I said this over and over in my review and I truly mean it -- Britney's vocals in In the Zone are INCREDIBLE and the songs (beats/tunes/etc) are GREAT. (Again, as stated, Britney co-write seven of the twelve new songs on this album.) <br />In the words of a non-Britney fan after she heard a few songs off the album: <BR>Dang. I'm going to Have to buy it now -- her music has evolved and matured soo much. <br />She has matured so much as a person and singer and her music has matured along with her. In the Zone is an absolutely fantastic album. <br />Go get In the Zone!<br />-Dan1113
B00008H2LB|5.0|the album was a welcome reminder that linkin park was not going to continue making albums off hybrid theory. the sound is definately unique. the words are powerful and the music rocks. unlike other albums, each song is truly different.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|The wait is over and we finally get to see what the time away has been for. Britney has grown as a person as well as an artist and this album proves just that. I mean, how many southern suburban girls can record a song with the Ying-Yang Twins and have a hit? (ref. to (I've Got That) Boom Boom) This album is eclectic and full of dance tracks yet you can still see personality shine through. I must say that for those that judge the album by ME AGAINST THE MUSIC, they are wrong. From Boom Boom to Breathe On Me, the album screams &quot;I'm a woman now!&quot; and pledges a new Britney. Toxic is a great return to the younger Britney but poses more mature lyrics and better vocal strength as does Everytime. With the bonus remixed Me Against The Music, following a ballad, you get to see first hand that Britney has the ability to make you feel as well as feel the beat. In conclusion, all that I can say is that this album is a must have for the winter season. Check it out!
1573225517|2.0|Ok now here is one book that is so sad it will make you want to snuff it!  Not a good book to read if you're already feeling depressed- despite it's uplifting ending.  It has some mildly amusing moments and some interesting theories about relationships.  However the book left me feeling completely empty.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see Cher's Farewell Tour concert twice.  This DVD is a wonderful representation of the concert.  I found it quite interesting to see the extra footage what goes on behind the stage before the curtain opens and how many other people are involved in the production of this outstanding concert!  This DVD is worth the money and a must for any Cher fan!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I've been a Britney fan since the begining.  I wasn't to pleased with the &quot;Oops&quot; album only because it came out a year after her first one.  But the &quot;britney&quot; album brought me back as a fan and now &quot;in the zone&quot; has me listening to Britney in a whole new light.  I think she has proven to everyone that she isn't going to go anywhere. Ala, Madonna Britney is learning how to improve herself and change with the times.  The new princess of pop has got what it takes and it helps out a lot that Madonna helped her with the first single which is awesome! A great club song.  There are some ok songs on this cd, like 'outrageous', 'showdown' and 'the hook up'  but the cd is full of great songs, 'matm' 'i got that boom' 'breath on me' 'toxic' 'shadow' 'brave new girl' and the beautiful 'everytime' BRITNEY HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!
B00005JKZV|4.0|Lord of the Rings is my all-time favorite novel!!<BR> And Peter Jackson's outstanding interpretation and adaptation does Tolkien's creation the most justice it has received since its original publication.<BR> This said, I have one very small, but justified complaint on Jackson's take.<BR> WHY, oh why, the Faramir-as-Boromir character cloning?? Faramir, as everyone who's read the book and loved his character, will tell you, was Frodo's best friend next to Sam in his trecherous journey through Middle Earth. To lose this comrade and help is to MAR the beauty of Tolkien's vision. We encounter too much repetition in a movie that is already full of it! (repetition of men being depraved and power-hungry slaves, repetition of Arwen's tossing away immortality, repetition of Frodo's struggle with the Ring...) While reminders do need to be dashed in here and there, as the movies are released one year apart, this was disappointing. The refreshing character of Faramir could have served as a reprieve from the chaos and uncertainty that poor Frodo and Sam faced, as it did in the novel. This violence and urgent movement from Faramir that PJ and cohorts think necessary absolutely was NOT necessary to keep the audience interested. I think it would have made more of an impression had Faramir been portrayed as the unique, truly-good, Aragorn-like character he was and not the brooding, rejected, less-favored, yet determined-to-be-well-thought-of son of Denethor into which Jackson made him. Tolkien's character is fully worthy of this speech: \\"I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and glory.\\"  This is a much different Faramir than in the movies, despite where he ends up when they part and his \\"quality\\" is finally shown. His \\"quality\\" was shown in that speech, would they have only left it in! <BR>I can understand and did enjoy pretty much everything else: theflowerly love story of Aragorn and Arwen, something I thought was beautifully shot and necessarily emphasized. The madness of Helm's Deep was perfect! The endless fighting and hopelessness they at times felt was right on. <BR>I liked the interpretation of Treebeard and the Ents. I enjoyed Eowyn and Eomer immensely and Theoden, despite his uncharacteristic stubborness. Though they did not empty the city, this gimmick works rather well. The urgency to keep Helm's Deep standing is not amplified. While mountain dwellers lived there, we did not have the time to be introduced to them, and their fate thus seemed unimportant. To have an entire city threatened was very clever indeed. Theoden's \\"exorcism\\" scene was an improvement upon the novel's subtlety and implied control of Saruman. His metamorphosis back to his original self, touching. Wormtongue was slithering, bastardly creepiness in the clever hands of Brad Dourif. <BR>And Gollum was perfection and everything I (and countless others) imagined him as, from as early on as \\"the Hobbit\\". <BR> All in all, it's still a fantastic movie! Just a little flawed. The Prince of Ithilien still balks at his mutilated role, however, as do his faithful following.
B00005JKG7|4.0|I know the film &quot;Halloween&quot; has a huge following, but in my opinion, John Carpenter's 2nd film, THE FOG, is far superior.<br />Beautifully filmed and accompanied by an impressive score, this is his best film. It is a truly frightening film that addresses actual fear, such as, what is in the fog? If you haven't seen the movie, you need to find out what is in the fog. It really did give me goosebumps. Not many films can chill me, this one did though.<br />Turn out the lights and watch it alone.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Finally, the Springsteen catalog gets an appropriate Greatest Hits Treatment.<BR>Two discs of great stuff, and a third full of great rarities for the hard core fans among us. Well worth the investment.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This album more than any other chili peppers album does not let down anywhere from start to finish. Besides that, it just has some truly incredible songs. I now have every one of their albums, but still this one is the best by far, even better than BSSM. That is because the guitar on this album is the most innovative thing john has ever done. For Californication, frusciante does not really seem influenced by any other guitarists. I mean, of course the influence is there, but the guitar work is the most original here of any other album. No other guitarist writes the simple beautiful melodic patterns that make up most songs on this album. This is where they reached a melodic peak, before it got a little too simple on By the Way. Oh, and although usually BSSM and Cali are considered the two best chili albums by fans, with BSSM being more popular, it is almost always agreed that the lyrics here are the best. Song by song:<br />Around the World: Best opening track you could ask for. Each instrument is introduced one at a time, and a simple funky verse leads perfectly into a melodic chorus. The lightest track on the album, closes with prolonged chord strumming, something found on several songs on this album.<br />Parallel Universe: This is a great rock song. Pretty different from anything else they have done because of the real fuzzy distortion on the chorus. Ends with another chord strum, this time with something of a solo over it.<br />Scar Tissue: Probably the most melodic song they have ever and will ever make, this is the prime example of johns melodic riffs. The musical interludes or solos are also perfect note choice solos.<br />Otherside: Likely the best song on the best album. The vocals here are haunting, the riff again is beautiful, and the lyrics are incredibly visual and symbolic but visceral. It also has an insane and hectic bridge (think 21st century schizoid man by king crimson) before going back to the chorus.<br />Get on Top: The funk on Californicationis so clearly different from any other upbeat sound they have. Its funky, but with a very melancholy tone, highlighted by the bridge of this song.<br />Californication: The title track is the second best song on the album. The riff here may be the best sound on the whole album, it just draws you in. The lyrics here are incredibly deep and sadly funny.<br />Easily: A song that sort of stands out on this album because its just rock all the way. Still, it has great lyrics and a nice solo with several guitars at the end.<br />Porcelain: One of the most hated songs by fans, but also loved by a smaller camp. I am one of the people who thinks this song is great. Really soft, a slow rhythm with a melodic guitar following the words.<br />Emit Remmus: An awesome song. The guitar here is just a couple of searing notes for the verse, as most of the sound is the drums here. All of the choruses on the album are great, and the one in this song is no exception.<br />I Like Dirt: This is a weird minor key funk that has a good solo, but the solo is very different from everything else on the album. It sounds a lot more like their older sound. In fact, that contrast works here perfectly, but still overall the song is weaker than the rest.<br />This Velvet Glove: Back to the great songs. This song has more terrific lyrics, another great riff that manages to still be completely original and different from the others, and a great chorus. No matter how the could play this song it would be sad.<br />Savior: Song pretty clearly written about john rejoining the band. The lyrics here are quite different, fewer symbols and images, more straightforward ones. This song has a stranger more experimental guitar sound, great outro solo.<br />Purple Stain: The lyrics here aren't as great as the rest of the album, but they are still smart and this song just rocks up until the closing strums.<br />Right on Time: A pretty light hearted song as far as this album goes. Still very good smart lyrics. One ofthe weaker songs on the album, but it flows well into the last song.<br />Road Trippin': An acoustic song that surprisingly works very well as a close. Great lyrics, and a nice simple organ part to keep it fresh.
B00009V7T2|2.0|Well it's different, but doesn't mean it's good. They seem like talented musicians except they can't write a song to save thier lives. They're too busy trying to be as arty as possible  whether it be the tuneless bombastic music or the ridiculously inane lyrics. He obviously used a thesaurus for every single word he wrote for this album. I gave it 2 stars because john frusciante, who is a true music visionary appears on it.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Season two of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; was absolutely amazing. A great deal of character development, and more of the best acting on television. As the editorial review above notes, Peter Krause really starts to shine and does some downright BRILLIANT work in the second season. Patricia Clarkson is also fantastic in the episode &quot;Back to the Garden&quot;, a beautifully shot hour. &quot;It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year&quot; is another of my favorites, giving viewers a look at the day leading up to Nathaniel Fisher's death in the first season and &quot;I'll Take You&quot; is the season's climax in Nate and Brenda's relationship. If you liked the first season, you'll love this.<br />HBO!! Get around to releasing it would you? The first season came out when, last January? It really doesn't take a year. Come on!!
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|Have been waiting for this DVD for a long time.  My daughter got me listening to Coldplay and I just love the songs.  The DVD is has reltively good sound. I was dissapointed with the camera angles especially from behind the crowd where the heads of the crowd use up part of the screen.  Maybe thats just me.  A lively performance none the less.  If you are a Coldplay fan get this DVD, if you are not get this DVD.  For the price you get a CD and a 45 minute tour behind the scenes footage.  You cant beat that.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|The first thing I want to mention is that the reason songs like &quot;Breath&quot; and &quot;State of Love and Trust&quot; (while great) aren't included in this collection is because they are readily available on a widely released cd, the &quot;Singles&quot; soundtrack, which is easy to find.  The rest of the songs on have either been released nowhere (Education, Hitchiker, Undone, etc...), are only found on Singles (Last Kiss, Alone, Other Side, Footsteps, etc...), or can only be found on difficult to locate compilation or benefit discs (Hard To Imagine, Whale Song, Gremmie Out of Control, etc...).  <br />Next, it's obvious why some of these songs did not make albums, but it's not because they are weak in any way.  Many of the songs just don't fit into the overall mood of the particular album sessions they were recorded during.  They are no less great because of this, it's just that the band members and some others couldn't find a way to get them on the albums.<br />A personal highlight for me is the commentary the band members have on the songs, especially when you see that some of the songs were personal favorites of band members for the particular album (such as Ed's favorite songs &quot;Down&quot; and &quot;Alone&quot; from those respective recording sessions, and Mike's affection for &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;, which he still doesn't know what the song is about).  It is very disappointing the one of my favorite pj b-sides &quot;Angel&quot; was cut out of the cd at the last minute, but that's a minor argument.  The other songs here more than make up for that unfortunate matter that was beyond the band's control.<br />Another song worth mentioning is the haunting &quot;4/20/02&quot; written the day Layne Staley died.  It's a solo performance by Ed, and there's obvious anger there, and disappointment.  It's a great tribute, and it was nice (relatively speaking) to hear how Layne affected his friends.<br />All in all, pearl jam has proven why they are one of themost respected and well known rock bands in recent history.  With b-sides of this quality, how can you ignore the sheer talent of these five (well, 8 including all the drummers) individuals.  Great album.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|First of all: I consider myself a huge Beatles fan, virtually listened to everything the fab four have come up with.<BR>So I'm sorry to say: but definitely something went wrong when this CD was compiled. <br />My complaints:<BR>* this I find really the most disturbing thing: the important songs sound less flawless than the original (e.g. vocals/ guitar parts on &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot;)<BR>* although 'Let it Be' had its moments, I think most Beatle fans will agree, it is their least memorable LP/CD, so who really cares about these new mixes of songs like 'Dig A Pony', 'For You Blue', 'I Got A Feeling' and 'I Me Mine'?<BR>* somehow the talking and noises on the original made some sense, while on this cd they don't (e.g. false start on 'For You Blue', the first seconds of 'Across The Universe') <BR>* as others indicated, the song line up is clueless, starting off with 'Get Back' with a disturbing ugly fade out (the best version of 'Get Back' is the single version from '69).<br />If this really was Paul's longtime wish to reissue bare versions of some songs, I think a short CD with maybe 4 songs would have been enough. <br />In retrospect I have great admiration for the job Phil Spector did 33 years ago. Perhaps a person who has never heard the original 'Let it Be' might like the '... Naked' CD, otherwise you'd better stick with the original!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|ok. i expected a very good albom and i really got what i wanted and even more. lets put the image and thought about britney aside.<BR>musically this albom is a masterpeace. each song is different and good in its way. sometimes there are missing litlle things vocally but the albom is just special.<BR>1-me against the music-you all know... 8/10<br />2-boom boom-its a good one but the rap parts just dont semm to fit in. but still its a good one. and its going to be the 2d single. 8/10<br />3-showdown-something is special with this one. its a simple song but its melody and its chrous are so good. 9/10<br />4-breathe on me. another great song. pure dance great song. so deep and hot. britney touches the dance style here. 9/10.<br />5-early mornin'. good melody, relaxing song and very different. here she touches another genre in pop. its just getting better. 8/10.<br />6-toxic. bloodshy and avant produced this one alongside with #3. its a really coll song. moody and dancy. one of the bests. 9/10.<br />7-ourageous. the lyrics are awsome. the song is great. the melody is well done. r kelly produced it. for some reason i think the tour will be called outrageos. good idea. the problem with this one is that its too short. 9/10. <br />8-touch of my hand. defenatlly the best. ist asian melody just burns inside you when u hear it. altough its a litlle beat provocative its so true and so great lyriclly melodicly vocaly and musically... 10/10.<br />9-the hook up. a redzone production. so good one. better then me against the music. moody vibey and rythemy. 9/10.<br />10-shadow. matrix production. reminds me avril lavignes &quot;im with you&quot;. good one but britney is better with songs like #4 #8 #9... but still a powerfull ballad. 9/10.<br />11-brave new girl. one of the best. starts with r:b and rap style and ends with melody that reminds madonnas &quot;ray of light&quot;. very good song. the lyrics are well written, the rap parts are great. perfect. 10/10<br />12-everytime. tooboring sometimes. so touching sometimes. a good one that is good when youre in bad times or in love. catchy gret melody. 9/10.<br />what more can i say. she says it reflects where she is rught now. well, musically shes in a great place. lyricly its changes. sometimes too provocotive. but every cut is diferent and this is what is special about the albom. its a very good one and you cant describe it. she achieves a great goal with this one. there r no simillar songs, each one touches another genre and the mix of all of them is 10/10....... fans will die 4 it maybe witout any reason, but those who r searching for somethin special and different will also like it, and not only because its britney. keep on going britney i love u.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Well, I've been a fan of AC/DC for a few months now, ever since someone played Back In Black in the locker room, and they are one of the best live acts ever. A few months later, i decided to go to the record store across the street and spend all my lunch money for the week on this DVD. It proves that AC/DC. I haven't watched the whole thing, I must admit, but I saw enough to impress me beyond my wildest dreams. It has a classic lineup of songs, nearly all of the classics. As another reviewer put it, Brian Johnson does a great job of covering Bon's songs, like Highway to Hell, Dirty Deeds, T.N.T. and others. I cant comment much on sound quality, because the audio on my TV is screwed up and i couldn't hear Angus at all. My little brother was playing with his friends in the same room, so I didn't dare play Whole Lotta Rosie, hearing about the inflatable girl... <BR>All in all, this is a great DVD. I believe the back of the box put it best: 'Live at Donington is one of hte greatest live concert documents of all time.'
B0000E1WKE|5.0|This has to be the greatest Christmas album ever.  I can't imagine my Christmases before this album. Her voice is amazing and Whitney is back to show how it's done.  Regaining her crown.
B00000BKDV|5.0|When my friend recommended Iron Maiden to me, I was a little skeptical.  For some reason I had viewed Iron Maiden, before actually listening to it, as some sort of death metal band.  Maybe I envisioned that because they like to put zombies/demons/whatever on the front of their albums.  This was a case where I definitely made a mistake in judging the CD by its cover.<br />     When I first listened to it, I wasn't that impressed.  Sure, I liked the beginning of &quot;Still Life&quot;, but after the first 2:44 it went downhill...or so I thought at the time.  In truth, I just didn't listen to it enough to really appreciate the amazing guitar work.  However, I can honestly say that I am not a big fan of Bruce Dickinson's vocals...it's not that they don't sound well with the music, it's just that I don't like that high pitched type voice (you see, I'm used to listening to James Hetfield of Metallica).  Nevertheless, I didn't feel that not liking the vocals affected my enjoyment of this CD too much.  There were several songs where I DID enjoy the lyrics as well as the guitar work.<br />     I'd have to say that my favorite song on this CD is &quot;To Tame A Land&quot;.  It really demonstrates the right way to have a song over seven minutes that is interesting the entire time.  The guitar work in that song is so varied that you often times forget you're still on the same song.  I made that mistake the first few times I was listening to the song...I started falling asleep and then woke and thought that the CD started over again, but then I realized my CD player doesn't do that, and I was like, &quot;What the...?&quot;, and then it dawned on me that I was still listening to the same song.  It really is that varied. <BR> <BR>     Another of my favorites was &quot;Flight of the Icarus&quot;.  This was one of the few songs on this CD where I thought the vocals were absolutely astounding.  I love midway through the song, when the lyrics start, &quot;Just a babe in a black abyss/No reason for a place like this&quot;.  That may be the best part of any song on the entire CD.<br />     There were, however, a few songs I didn't care for.  Number one on that list was &quot;Quest for Fire&quot;.  How can you take any song seriously that starts off with &quot;In a time when dinosaurs walked the Earth&quot;?  I like songs that actually mean something to me, or can express in song what I feel emotionally.  I don't think there is an emotion that would correspond with that. <BR> <BR>     The other song I didn't care for was &quot;Sun and Steel&quot;.  There really wasn't any one reason that I would pinpoint for not liking that song, it just didn't appeal to me.  Maybe it's because, again, I couldn't really relate with things like &quot;You killed your first man at 13&quot;, etc.  It might also have been because I don't like hearing two or three voices singing at once, to me that sounds like I'm at my sisters middle school chorus concert, espcially when they are as high pitched as those in this band.  <br />     Overall though, I really liked this CD.  It was definitely worth my money, and it also gave me something new to listen to now that I've heard every Metallica album.  The friend that recommended this to me said he thought it was their best album.  I can't be the judge of that since this is the only one that I've heard, but I can honestly say that this is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time, and I'm definitely going to be purchasing more Iron Maiden in the near future!
B00005JMFO|5.0|There is very little really not to like about this charming collage of a movie. <br />Brilliant ensemble of actors, and thus by implication great cameos from the ilk of Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Emma Thomson; credible romantic vignettes intercut together, and thankfully not too saccharine to be implausible (not everyone ends up in their preferred romance for instance); a fair bit of nudity (a big bold \\"R Actually\\"); and above all, some delectable humor -- there are sentimentalistic crests but swiftly followed by a jibe or crack that balances the narrative. <br />The vignettes: <br />-- Colin Firth as a writer with a soft spot for his Portuguese maid while working on a novel in a French town<BR>-- Liam Neeson as a widower managing his grief by lending his teenager son a hand with his love life <BR>-- Emma Thomson as the cheery wife of Alan Rickman, an executive who is falling prey to the come-ons of an office colleague<BR>-- Bill Nighy as a spent-out rock star on the comeback trail with a holiday version of the Trogg's \\"Love Is All Around\\"<BR>-- Hugh Grant as a wonderfully self-deprecating bachelor prime minister in love with a benign British version of Monica Lewinsky <BR>-- Laura Linney as an American expat with a romantic life that suffers due to her obligation for her autistic brother<BR>-- Andrew Lincoln as a tortured bloke madly but secretly in love with the trophy wife (Keira Knightley) of his best friend<BR>-- Kris Marshall as a would-be superstud trying to get to America (he's \\"cocksure\\" his British accent will be a chick magnet)<BR>-- Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as two innocents who fall in love while working as stand-ins in a porn movie <BR>-- Billy Bob Thornton as a nasty U.S. president who gets his comeuppance <BR>-- Rowan Atkinson as a prissy department store clerk<br />What more can you ask for in one sitting? Don't read too much into the \\"too long to be interesting\\" reviews, this is a must-watch for anyone with a sensitive bone and an adult pass.It's not your everyday sappy chick-flick but a fascinating tapestry of love and longing in our modern lives.<br />Don't miss it!
0062502182|4.0|if u are 40+, have a secure job with fixed paycheck every month, used to have dreams but now too late to act and too lazy to make a change, this book is *not* for u. If you only understand the meaning of responsibilities and does not dare to take risks/adventures, flee when u see this title.<br />As with any fable, the aroma of this book does require personal interpretation or maybe a little bit of self reflection.<br />My interpretation of this book is this: two men both dreamt of treasures. One man takes no action and remain in egypt. maybe this guy is too lazy to act. The other man is a believer. he takes on a journey to seek out his *dream*.<br />Every cities that the man (shepard boy) visited and every decisions that he made attributed a little towards his final goal. <br />It is always my believe that reaching the final destination of every journey is *meaningless* becos its during journey towards a goal that defines who you are. The aurthor managed to twist the story to bring that out in a way that I find quite amusing. In a sense, this book does reflect some of my own believe and findings in life. perhaps this is the reason i gave it a 4-star.<br />I chew on it for a while.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I enjoyed listening to this reworking of one of my favorite Beatle collections.  Across the Universe is great, as is Don't Let me Down and I've Got A Feeling.  The rest is not different enough frome the original recording to notice.  I was particularly disappointed by Disc Two.  The booklet that comes with the CD gives much more insight into the recording process, and the bits are too short to get anything out of them.  The one interesting moment - and I do mean moment - was the genesis of John Lennon's &quot;Jealous Guy&quot;.  The words are completely different, but the tune is distinctive.<br />Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.  For those of us that own the entire catalog, its a must have.<br />When will they remaster Live at the Hollywood Bowl !!!!!!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I don't know why people don't like Britney Spears. She is hot, and has a good voice. Her songs on this cd are amazing! And hey, if I had a body like that I would show it off too! This cd is great, if you haven't listened to it you don't know what your missing!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|These guys far exceeded my expectations. After listening to &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; on the radio I wanted to hear more but I was worried I'd hear yet another typical garage band that can't quite cut it.<br />These guys really do cut it though. This album is really easy to fall in love with. They encompass the styles of garage rock - from fast and hard songs like &quot;Are you gonna be my girl&quot; and &quot;rollover dj&quot; Jet make sure to include the more alternative tracks, like Lazy Gun (my favourite song of the album), and softer songs like &quot;look what you've done.&quot; <br />This cd works well as a whole (where you won't be skipping any trakcs) and as single tracks (where each individual can pick out their favourites). <br />On my last note I'm also going to claim that these guys are way better than the Vines.
0385504209|5.0|I usually don't read books of this nature, but after my wife and father-in-law raved about it, I had to read it. I was hooked on it from the first two chapters.<br />Being raised Christian, this book also challenged many of the ideals I was taught through out my life. If you read this with an open mind, it is even more entertaining.  I read this book in three days, which at 450 pages, is not easy.  ( my job provides me with a lot of down time). The suspense Dan Brown creates is that good.<br />Read this book, you will not be disappointed. You might even learn sometihng. I know I did.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is Britney best work to date.  I highly recommend this CD! Rock on.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney is often criticized for lack of the ability to truly sing, and I, for one, feel that this criticism is warranted.  However, it is not the ability of a singer that creates success in today's world of music. There are many other factors which are essential... factors that Britney has in her favor. She is not a musical genius or great at \\"making beats\\" as someone said earlier... she just has the right producers (note: Michael Jackson has a great voice, yet he's stuck on archaic producers, hence the flopping of Invincible and Blood on the Dance Floor). There is nothing incredibly new about this album from a production level - they are good beats by good producers - the only new thing is Britney's evolving sexuality. Overall, it could become a good club CD because of a few good beats. But there's definitely a few to skip over.
0802130208|1.0|i bought this book several years ago on the recommendation of someone i thought would know better.  so i started it and stopped about 50 pages into this &quot;opus&quot;.  just didn't connect.  my boyfriend will not allow a book to leave our library so i stuffed it back in.  3 years later i picked it up and it started its limited appeal.  i committed myself to finishing it even tho' it was  frustrating.  i agree with several reviewers that there is definitely HYPE about this book and OCCASIONALLY sparks some interest and imagination.  that being said, the protagonist, I. Reilly, is too fantastic to believe.  the one character i really belived and found terrific was &quot;Jones&quot;.  here is a ripe character.  everthing else is overwrought and silly. IF YOU WANT great character development and wild imagination pick up Eugenides' MIDDLESEX or MARQUEZ' One Hundred Years of Solitude ---HERE LIES BRILLIANCE.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|One Word: WOW.  Britney Spears' new album simply amazes me.  I only heard it a couple of times, but WOW.  My favorite songs are: The Hook Up, Touch of My Hand, I Got (Boom Boom), Early Morning and Outrageous. Rock on Miss Britney Spears!
B000088E6D|5.0|A refreshing new sound. A start to bringing the golden age of music back to the airwaves. Michael in phenomenal. I saw him in the movie Totally Blonde and not only can he sing, but act as well. He is the total package, a triple threat if you will. His voice carries through all ages. This CD gives you the feeling that love and romance will never die. Great Job!
B0000C8AQM|5.0|This CD is awesome, and this is coming from a person that doesn't usually listen to rock music. But after watching this freakin' hilarious movie, which I thought was actually really good, I am definitely going to listen to some rock 'n' roll more often. Oh, and does anybody know what song Jack Black is playing on his guitar and humming to with his feet up on his desk right before they officially announce the band the School of Rock????? I LOVE THAT SONG THAT HE'S PLAYING!!! Can anybody tell me what it is?!?!?!
B00005JMFR|5.0|This movie is so good that it makes the Matrix trilogy better than the Star Wars trilogy.<br />This is the best \\"trilogy ending film\\" that I have EVER seen. This is how \\"Return of the Jedi\\" should have been. I was on the edge of my seat with this film even though I knew ahead of time how it would end. I never really felt that way when I saw \\"Return of the Jedi\\" for the first time. I just knew that Han Solo would shut down the shields and I knew the Death Star was history. I never really worried about the characters the way I worried about the \\"Revolutions\\" heroes. They were written very well and they were all very human and vulnerable and they made you really admire their heroism during the battle for Zion. They just made me feel that I was in the battle with them. \\"Return of the Jedi\\" never did that. It will never do that. I love Star Wars but I have to say that \\"Matrix Revolutions made it look like a $2.00 joke in comparison. This was an excellent way to end a excellent series of films.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I write this here only because I feel I have to. The 1 star ratings the album is getting by reviewers with two or three unexplained, vague sentences is aggravating and simply not fair. I just read a longer, more intelligent review that gave it 2 -- the Floyd fan -- and that I can take, but the mindless reviews that are bogging down the overall rating of the album is ridiculous.<br />I don't know what to say, this is a good, GOOD -- no, great -- album. Admittedly, Radiohead is probably my favorite band. That's not to say I've always understood, or even liked them. The Bends is a rocking album filled with emotion and angst, be it whiny or not, and the number of memorable ballads on it is unmatched by most. I'm only 20 -- and quite a screwed up 20 year old as is -- but it was an album that at a point in my life really hit a note with me, lyrically. Anyway, OK Computer obviously came along and took over the world, and for good reason. It's probably my favorite album of the 90's; the music is downright brilliant, they create a technological ambience without losing emotion or Spirit (something I can't seem to say of Floyd, who's Existential themes and other-worldly soundscapes are no doubt intellectually captivating but leave me feeling empty, and really just tired, inside), combining awesomely symbolic lyrics with boatloads of energy and passion. Let Down and No Surprises are sublime masterpieces that few bands will ever touch. (I just keep going don't I?) So yeah, Kid A came, it was even more of an experiment... And I loved it. Radiohead taught me the definition of progressive rock, and Kid A exemplifies that. It's edgy, subversive, a journey, really. It's an album that you haven't heard if you haven't listened to on a pair of nice headphones. I'll be the first to admit the effect is far different than than that of OK Comp (it probably leans more towards the Floyd-esque sound/melody), but it's totally captivating nonetheless. Amnesiac, well... An album I was first disapointed by due to it's completely bizzare nature (far more so than Kid A) eventually turned out to be enchanting and utterly hypnotic. Admittedly it's a bit of a skewed album, and the song structure is questionable, but I found lying down, eyes closed, headphones blaring, to be almost Religious. I'll spare you any more gushing.<br />Anyway, now that I've finished up that uneccessary summary, we have Hail to the Thief. On a purely intuitive level, this is my 2nd favorite Radiohead album, shortly behind OK Computer. It's unquestionably more entertaining than either Kid A or Amnesiac -- if not quite as epic -- and is, to be utterly blunt, a f@#*ing blast. There's a profound, visceral energy to almost every song on the album. Does it &quot;ROCK&quot; like OK Computer? In my opinion, it's a, &quot;GOD YES DOES IT EVER!&quot;. &quot;2+2=5&quot;, &quot;Where I End and You Begin&quot;, &quot;Myxomatosis&quot;... These songs rock. Admittedly, the whole album doesn't rock in such a sense, but even other songs like &quot;The Gloaming&quot;, &quot;There There&quot;, and &quot;A Punchup at a Wedding&quot; have a very complex, yet melodic structure that I deem as rock-worthy, even if they don't immediately stand out as such. I think the combination of Kid-A/Amnesiac-esque synthesizers -- not quite as complex or innovative, but still brililant -- and forceful rythms and melodies makes this album stand out on it's own, easily.<br />I've read comments about how this album doesn't flow, and that's strange, because I myself would say the Tao itself was bursting through (almost) every moment of the recording stage here. &quot;We Suck Young Blood&quot; (which I like, yet is my least favorite) disturbs the flow more than anything else on the album, but otherwise it's like butter. <br />Bottom line, this album is technically superior to 99% of the stuff out today, even if it might be a small step backwards as far as sheer creativity is concerned. Quite frankly, I'm ALL FOR them taking a step back, because this is the most entertaining album I've heard in at least a year. To get a good idea of my tastes, my two other favorite albums of the year are probably The Coral's &quot;The Coral&quot;, Dave Matthews &quot;Some Devil&quot;, and Interpol's &quot;Turn On The Bright Lights&quot;, though that one may be 2002. <br />Anyway, get it.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Cantique de Noel (O Holy Night)<br />Whitney shows her butt here! She shows the world why she's who she is. It's all about the voice, the talent, and did I mention that voice?  Whitney soars and glides gracefully throughout the peaks and crevices of this song, with a rich voice full of passion and depth. Good job, Whitney.<br />O Come, O Come Emmanuel<br />Who's voice is more beautiful to hear on this song than Whitney's? She gives this song the emotion, passion, and strength that is so due to it. With only crisp vocals and snapping to back her, she turns this song into an instant holiday classic. Belted out with unearthly passion and joy before unheard, she gives this a soulful and effective twist. <br />The Christmas Song<br />Whitney--yes, raindeer know how to fly! Yes Lord, they do! And she tells us so well! Those \\"well\\"'s she puts in there for added effect are priceless. She makes the listener feel as if they're watching her seranade him personally. Her voice melts like cotton candy as it flows to your ears. Savor this classic.<br />Little Drummer Boy<br />Bobbi Kris is going to be a force to be reckoned with. Mark my words. Her phrasing and vibrato are excellent--she's learning very well. The breakdown in the middle of the song makes you want to get up and dance. Excellent, from the first note to the last. Everything compliments each other in what is sure to become a timeless rendition of this song.<br />Deck the Halls/Silent Night<br />I would have, never, in my wildest dreams, thought to arrange this song in this way. It breaks so much from the traditionality of the song, and I'm abundantly pleased with that. Whitney is gracefully flowing up and down the vocal scale, while adding that little grit in her voice she's become known for. She put her soul into this song, and it is evident. <br />Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas<br />It got off to a slow start, in my humble opinion. But she redeems wonderfully. The runs in this song were classic and are gonnabe near to impossible to reproduce, except by the diva herself. She put her vocal stamp on this song. Her vocals are rich and pure on this song and she gives a quite unique interpretation of this sung-too-many-times-by-people-that-shouldn't-have-lended-their-voices-to-it holiday song.<br />I'll Be Home For Christmas<br />I feel her in this song. She really put the gospel twist on this and I'm loving every minute of it. Her vibrato on this song is so soothing and her vocals so welcoming and warm. This is a song that one can just close their eyes and nod their heads to in appreciation for she singings it in such a way that it can only be fully appreciated when concentrating on the song. She has definitely coined this version as a classic.<br />The First Noel<br />Although it's evident that Whitney put her heart and soul inside of this song, she became quite throaty on some of those belted notes and that took way from the song--not considerably, but some at least. I honestly believe this song would have been more effective if done somewhat like \\"I'll Be Home...\\" or \\"Who Would Imagine...\\" I, however, do like the song.<br />One Wish<br />This song was very lackluster. It takes you to the build up and then lets you down with nothing. She also becomes throaty on this one as well.  She doesn't do as much with this song as she could have, in my opinion. It is not one of my most favorite tracks. <br />Overall, this is CD will be a treasure that everyone should be able to enjoy, especially if there is a deep appreciation or somewhat of an appreciation for Christmas music.
B000002UAO|5.0|If Rolling Stone Magazine says that this is the #5 album of all time then it must be true.  After all, it's the Beatles!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love this cd . I've been playing it non stop since I bought it .Every song on this album is amazing and her voice sounds amazing . My favorite songs on the album are Toxic and Breathe on me.This album is way better then her previous albums
B0000DJZA5|4.0|My two favorite bands, The Beatles and Deep Purple have put out new albums.  One is good and one is really excellent. Let It Be... Naked (yes, we are living in a Britney/Madonna world now) is a stripped down version (no strings and no horns)   of the original May of 1970 album. The songs are also in a nice new running order and have been digitally remixed to sound...oh, so out of this world. The clarity is breathtaking.  It sounds as if the Beatles are right there in your living room. Nice production job fellows! It is less about Phil Spector and more about moving the Beatles into the 21st century in my opinion. But, as the one critic before me said: Nothing really NEW is on this new release. [...]Naked: 4 stars  [...]
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban's new CD is nothing short of amazing.  I'm the type of person that will listen to a CD by changing tracks constantly... never quite satisfied in entirety by any single album.  &quot;Closer&quot; has given me reason to change my ways.  It is a diverse compilation of dynamic songs and a wonderful blend of genres.  Since receiving it, this CD has lulled me to sleep every night and charmed me awake every morning.  And that's not enough.  When I'm relaxing throughout the day I play it loud enough to resonate throughout the whole house.  Josh has a beautiful voice and he sings every song on his CD with perfection.  After listening to this album, even straight men will surely fall in love with Josh Groban.    <br />All my love to Josh :) His music is genuine inspiration in the purest form.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This CD is full of tracks that are fun to dance to and sing to. Britney has finally realized that she is not a singer and only has two earspliting ballads- &quot;Shadow&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot;. Other than those two stinkers, this is a great disc to dance around to. Keep it from the young kiddies, though- it's a lot racier than her previous CDs. My favorite tracks: Me Against the Music, Boom Boom, Early Mornin', Outrageous, and Brave New Girl.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|First the good news: the songs have been beautifully remixed.  The superior sound quality was evident from the opening riff of Get Back as soon as it hit my speakers.  Let's face it, if you've been listening to these songs for the past thirty odd years (as I have), then you know every nuance.  Kudos to the remix team, and one can only wish they'd give Abbey Road a shiny new coat of paint.<br />But now the bad news, as you've already heard.  This is not your father's Let It Be.  The ghost of Phil Spector has been thoroughly exorcised.  On the songs that he applied the Wall of Sound, I suppose that's a good thing.  For example, Across the Universe has always been one of my least favorite Beatle songs, the version on Anthology went along way towards resurrecting it from the doldrums, and this new mix is an improvement over either the Spector mix or the single version available on Past Masters 2.<br />But perhaps my biggest complaint is that none of the songs supposedly recorded on the roof that January day sound live.  Every song on this disc, while pleasant and crisp, sound as though they came from the Apple Studio.  I always thought that the chatter that filled out the original album gave a nice feel for the loose atmosphere of their final concert.  To be fair, though, I have a complete bootleg of the Rooftop Concert, where they played Get Back three times.  The version on the Let It Be album I have always suspected was the studio version with chatter added for effect.  For proof, I present to you the third version of Get Back as presented on Anthology 3.  This was where John hoped they passed the audition.  John and George's amps were cut off by the police in mid-song, and one can see George turning his back on in the film.  This guitar-less mix is not on either of these Let It Be albums.<br />And yes, I am an obsessive Beatle fan.<br />Further, this new album claims to be as the Beatles recorded it in January 1969.  As many well know, I Me Mine wasn't recorded until January 1970, after a brief rehearsal snipped was included in the film.  This was at the Beatles' final recording session, when John was on holiday.<br />All of this may be splitting hairs, but one can't help but feel that the only reason that this version is seeing the light of day is because John and George aren't here to veto it.  Rest in peace, lads.
B0000DJE9R|3.0|The song One More Chance is his best work since Bad.  The single alone is worth the price of the cd.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Yes, this will sell tons of copies to all the masses who are forced to listen to this. (Unfortunatley it's everywhere.) But, as for quality...DULL, same old sound. Sure she can dance and shes pretty, but sing? Not a chance. She STILL sounds like a stuffed up kid but &quot;breathy&quot;-really odd. With all the money she has maybe a few singing lessons would help.  I was hoping this would surpass the other cds, but its still as dull as ever. The songs all sound like they could have been on the last few cds, SHE DOES NOT EVOLVE at all.  Same sound, same beats, same cheesy poppy tunes.  Nothing new and nothing to speak highly of or celebrate.  If you dig her, you'll probably dig the cd but I bet it won't last in your cd tray for long.  She is no Chrisina or Whitney with the voice, (even she said so) &amp; she is no -and never will be, a Madonna.  Madonna made Madonna. Marketing made Britney.  Save your $.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is by far Britney's most mature sound.  Most of the songs have a very up beat techno feel, but there are two chilling songs \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\".  These are the best songs on the album, and it's too bad they will probably be overlooked due to the sexually energized songs like \\"Breathe On Me,\\" \\"Early Mornin',\\" and \\"Touch of My Hand\\".  Despite that, you should really buy this album just to experience a Britney weathered and matured during the last two years.

B00005AAFS|5.0|With one word: bombastic! Rammstein really managed to move forward and improve their fantastic style. Indeed very dark and haunting music but yet different compared to their previous albums. Each song has its individual sound and is perfectly mixed. You might have already realised that I'm German :-) so for me it's very important to mention that also the texts are as deep as sophisticated. So if you don't have the translation get one! It's worth it!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Let It Be has long been an anomaly in the Beatles catalog, and one of great debate. McCartney has gone down on record more than once stating that he has despised Phil Spector's production and window dressing treatments, and so with the release of Let It Be...Naked, an attempt to irradicate Spector's &quot;criminal&quot; mistreatment is made with crisp, crystal clear remastering and no fluffy string arrangements or between song banter to be found. But is it any better?<br />My answer is yes and no. <br />First the positive: The remastering is astounding. Instrumentation previously unheard now rises to the surface. Vocals are clearly heard, and an excellent job was done to capture an overall live feel as if you're in the room with the Beatles. &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine&quot; sound like definite improvements arrangement-wise and sonically to the previous well-known versions, IMO.<br />Now the negative: unless you're McCartney, someone close to the Beatles camp who was involved in the recording process, or a serious Beatle fanatic who probably already owns stripped down versions of these songs in bootleg form, then you're a probably a typical listener like myself who only knew the Spector recordings and now finds the stripped down versions, well... stripped down and incomplete. Whether you like the Spector recordings or not, they are the classic recordings that the general public has known and loved (or hated, depending on who you are). They're such a part of our musical history and vocabulary that Spector's treatments, for better or for worse, are every bit a part of the overall sonic makeup of the songs, whether McCartney can except that or not. So hearing &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; now without the fluffy arrangements sounds a bit unfinished and missing something, even if those string arrangements were possibly the most offensive additions Spector contributed to the album. And &quot;Let It Be&quot; has lost a bit of it's punch, opting for thetamer guitar solo to the grittier solo found on the original recording. (Q: is this the same version found on the Beatles blue album 1967-70?). Considering what Spector had to work with: hours and hours of recordings of partially unfinished songs, loose jams, dialog, etc., I think he did an admirable job in trying to tie it all together into some sort of cohesive, uniform concept. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't, but I promise you if you grew up knowing his versions by heart you will now find yourself missing some of his treatments. <br />The other negative aspect of the recordings, and I'm prepared to get flamed by Beatle fans here, are not with this specific re-release but with the Beatles performances themselves. Let It Be was and will always be somewhat of an abandoned child; a mish-mosh, hodge podge of great moments, okay moments, and toss offs, and will still stand as one of the Beatles weaker overall album efforts no matter what you do to it, especially when sandwiched between superior more consistent releases like the White Album and Abbey Road. That's not without stating that it has obvious high points as well, as few would deny that the title track or &quot;Across the Universe&quot; are some of the finest Lennon/McCartney songs ever written, and even the weaker moments are of a higher caliber than most bands, but for the Beatles the overall album feels a bit sub-par. (One wonders what these songs might have sounded like had George Martin smoothed away some of the rough edges). But it's easy now, in retrospect, to fabricate some &quot;concept&quot; tag on the album as their &quot;raw, live, bare bones release&quot; (granted this is true, and in fact, that is what distinguishes it from all other Beatles albums), when I tend to think that this kind of conceptualizing was tacked on by those who were afraid to admit that the Beatles might not be infallible after all and only AFTER it was already apparent that it was not on the level of their past releases. <br />As it were, Let It Be...Naked serves better as a curiosity rather than a necessary edition to your Beatles catalog, and sufficiently answers the question of what might had been had the Beatles had their way with the recordings. But if you're still missing LIB in your collection my suggestion is get the original Spector versions, simply because those are the classic recordings, like it or not.
B000001F9N|4.0|She leaves a sweet taste from the  &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; album, bring on the same attitude and velocity to this album. It wonderful how the song &quot;Wasted&quot; can make you get down! The last song on the album makes you think of anime cartoon opening credits. &quot;Try Me&quot; i think is the weakest song because of its length.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|People complain about whitney no matter what.  it seems she can never please everyone, shes either singing too perfectly without enough feeling, or too much feeling and not enough perfect singing.  If whitney had known that she would be held to unrealistic standards til the day she died, she may not have given us 10 years of perfection.  that being said, this holiday album is a perfect blend of everything.  whitney couldnt have made a better attempt to please everyone.  its a little pop, a little r&amp;b, a little gospel, and a little jazz.  whitney sings like no other, not like when she was 19, but still far better than anyone else out there.  this album makes all other christmas albums sound dated and unoriginal.  there are no boring version of christmas tunes on this cd.  highlights include &quot;little drummer boy&quot; &quot;o holy night&quot; &quot;o come o come emmanuel&quot; &quot;deck the halls/silent night&quot; &quot;the christmas song&quot; and &quot;have yourself a merry little christmas&quot;  if you like christmas music, you need to get this cd, regardless of what genre of music you listen to.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I was skeptical about this album after reading a few negative reviews posted here.  With my first listen of TOT, my fears were blown away. I do realize every one of us has different tastes /opinions. Some of fans obviously didn't expect the album to be that heavy yet complex to ears so they do complain. Someone calls it an evolution; others might think its crap. But guess what, the band could not and will never please everyone. Every step that Dream Theater takes (just like any other band) can be assessed in a different way, and I personally happen to dig new material.  After a few listens now I keep asking myself if this is their best. Maybe. And again, it is different from the rest of DT albums just like any of them is different from one another.<BR>Yes, my jaw was dropped after I heard angry sounding lyrics with some rapping and excessive language, heavy guitar and keyboards tone and some similarities to modern metal music. But, all that went with incredible playing of every member of the band, unexpected vocal harmonies, beautiful melodies and excellent musicianship. And the best part is that the album grows on you with each listen: you tend to find new elements in songs that you think you are now familiar with every listen.  Yes, this is easily their heaviest to date, no question, and they do incorporate some of that'nu-metal' into their songs.  But, who cares if they do it with class so that even those moments should not sound that bad to a melodic metal listener at all.<BR>There are seven songs on the album and only one of them is a 3-minute, piano driven ballad. All others are about or over 10 minutes long (one of them being an instrumental). The opener 'As I Am' is a straightforward rocker that gives a hint on what direction Dream Theater's taking with TOT. Petrucci goes totally insane and shreds like there's no tomorrow.  He does that on other songs as well showing he's no stranger to keep speed, melody and precision all in one. If I were to choose the best songs on the album, I would probably go with 'Endless Sacrifice' and 'In The Name Of God', but that might change after more listens as every song grabs me and sends me shivers or makes me smile.<BR>So, do not fully trust complainers and check the album out for yourself. I cannot assure you will fall in love with it. I do guarantee though that you will hardly find any other amazing, top quality album like this in today's world.
B00005JM02|4.0|It's very colorful, quite beautiful in parts, and my son finds the humor in several of the scenes without hearing any of the spoken words or music.  I sign parts of the story to him, but he loves it on his own just as well.  Personally I don't enjoy the storyline as much as I did Monsters, but the scenes with the dentist are absolutely hilarious and Dory is pure joy!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Adds more depth and fleshes out characters more fully than the theater version. Hours and hours of special features will keep you entertained for a long time. This is the version to buy. Fans rejoice!
B000002UTY|3.0|Quicksilver Messenger Service were the greatest guitar band of all time.  When it comes to improvisational jamming, NOBODY could rival them.  John Cipollina, my favorite guitarist in the world, and Gary Duncan together were an unbelievable force.  Unfortunately, though, this album doesn't feature them at their best.<BR>The 25-minute \\"Who Do You Love\\" suite starts out excellently, with John and Gary jamming away like there's no tomorrow.  But only certain parts of it are truly great.  John's solo (\\"How You Love\\") is full of fire, but it still doesn't show what he was REALLY capable of (for that, check out the compilation album LOST GOLD AND SILVER, in which his playing is beyond all words and comprehension).  Gary's solo (\\"When You Love\\") is more or less the same way.  And the closing part of the suite is totally awesome, with the band slowly and quietly building up the tension until...BOOM!, they tear into it again and resume jamming, as John repeatedly nails those high notes to the point where you think he's never gonna stop.<BR>\\"Mona\\" is pretty much boring, with no real excitement added to it.  \\"Calvary\\", on the other hand, is a total trip.  This is unquestionably the best song on the album.  It was recorded in the studio with overdubs, not in concert, but it really doesn't matter because the song is so great.  It features some of the most frightening, spaced-out notes that ever came from an electric guitar.  And when I say 'frightening', I don't just mean 'eerie', I mean downright SCARY.  Some parts of it are truly breath-taking, and all of those weird moans in the background are so creepy that they sound like ghosts in a graveyard.  I'm not kidding.  Don't listen to it in the dark.<BR>\\"Maiden Of The Cancer Moon\\" is just John fooling around again and not showing us his true potential.  And the title track is a fun little country western tune, kind of a strange way to end an album, but this is Quicksilver we're talking about, so I think we can forgive them.<br />So happy trails to you, until we meet again!
0446677450|1.0|First of all, let me say that this book is certainly well written. I have no doubt that Kiyosaki is making a lot of money from these books. But, I ask you, take a real close look at these reviews. Is anybody posting success stories? And saying how? By naming names?<br />A great deal of this book is in the new style of motivational writing. Every page you read is selling this book. And while I certainly don't doubt that it can inspire a great many people, when you put this book down you find that you haven't learned anything new that hasn't been said before.<br />I was shocked to see that some of the things that Kiyosaki recommends are horribly outdated. For example, he goes into great detail how he bought foreclosed property for little money down, and then turned it around to make a profit. Hey, this was a great moneymaking idea - back in the 1970s! But now, even he admits that if you try to do this you're going to find that there are hundreds of people, with the same idea, trying to buy the same property! So, why did he just explain a moneymaking scheme where the odds are overwhelming against you?<br />Another method he mentions is how he made money buying stock before it's offered for sale to the public. Kiyosaki forgets to tell you that this is called an Initial Public Offering (IPO), and it's damned difficult to get one - unless you either have connections or are extremely lucky.<br />Out of the 204 pages of this book, the actual practical advice can be summed up on maybe two pages. Here's the best advice from this book:<br />1. Buy ASSETS instead of LIABILITIES. This is the secret to making money without working. But Kiyosaki forgets to mention the famous axiom that goes along with buying assets: &quot;You need to have money, to make money&quot;<br />2. Buying a house is often a lousy investment. Banks make you believe that you're getting a terrific tax deduction by paying interest. The only problem is that for every $100 you get back in taxes, about $350 is wasted money, totally flushed down the toilet.<br />3. Understand Sales and Marketing, and be good at it.<br />4. Understand tax law.<br />I see a lot of well written reviews on this book. Professionally written reviews. I suspect that these reviewers have all learned from Kiyosaki's sense of style.<br />&quot;Most people work for their money. Rich people have their money work for them&quot; Gee, you know how much work it takes to write a 204-page book? And, at my count, he's written about 15 books.<br />You know, just because a book calls itself different, doesn't mean it is. If Kiyosaki's rich Dad really does exist, I suspect that he made his money writing books.
B00006AW2L|4.0|Actually, if it wasn't for the stupid, pointless &quot;Going Home&quot;, I would've given this bad boy a whole FIVE stars.  Be that as it may, this is still a killer album.  And might I add that it's the first album with ALL original songs.  No covers!<BR>We begin with the dreary sitar of Brian Jones to introduce &quot;Paint It Black&quot;, a true classic.  And it beats the crap out of &quot;Satisfaction&quot; any day of the week.  It's essentially a psychedelic song, highlighted by Jagger's plaintive vocals.  &quot;Stupid Girl&quot; is a funny little song that has Mick criticizing the female race in a somewhat cynical way.  I don't think that &quot;Lady Jane&quot; is quite as beautiful as some people claim it is, but I'll admit that it's a wonderful ballad.  &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; is the other radio classic on the album (along with &quot;Paint It Black&quot;), and it's a good song, but most radio hits are usually overrated.  &quot;Doncha Bother Me&quot;, however, is a fantastic blues tune with some top-notch guitar licks and Jagger's moody vocals.  Then you have some arse-kickin' rockers like &quot;Flight 505&quot;, &quot;It Ain't Easy&quot; and &quot;I Am Waiting&quot;.  &quot;High And Dry&quot; is a cool, country-esque tune with a somewhat unusual vocal melody, &quot;Think&quot; is basically your average Stones song, and &quot;Going Home&quot; is totally pointless, like I said in the introduction.  It's basically just Jagger rambling on like a fool for about EIGHT MINUTES!  What's the deal, Mick?<BR>But don't let that song detract from the overall glory of the album.  Finally they stop doing other people's material and let those creative stones start a-rollin'...
B0000TB03W|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said about Shania (as long as it's not negative because this woman knows how to perform!)<br />I saw the unfortunately butchered and shortened version of this concert on NBC. I myself had never seen her live before and have only recently started listening to her music. But, from what I've heard (I own her three most recent CDs), I love her music. I've never been a country music fan until recently when I got SO fed up with other performers that were so anti-US. To me, country-western singers still feel rooted in the good 'ol USA and so does Shania, even though she's from Canada and lives overseas. But, her music is still rooted in some very traditional country music styles while mixing in some pop and rock and roll as well.<br />Her music hits home in many areas and her voice is hauntingly beautiful when she sings. For those that have to pan her because she's not pure country, so what? This lady knows how to sing across many genres in the music industry which I believe is one of the main reasons Shania has been able to have such a huge following across the world!<br />This concert is excellent. A wonderful mix of old and new songs, hitting country, pop rock, and rock and roll genres in one concert makes this an wonderfully entertaining show to watch for the whole family! Heck, I could even turn the TV off and just listen to it pump through my stereo.<br />I was hoping this would come out on DVD after watching the concert on TV, and I was so happy to see it on Amazon a month back. Now that I have the package in my hands, I can only say I have no bad feelings about it except that the packaging is pretty plain. No booklet or anything inside the case except the DVD. But hey, I purchased this DVD to watch and listen to her in concert, not read about it.<br />What I'm also glad is that they did NOT interrupt the concert with back-stage material as they did on TV. THe concert is shown without interruption and the sound is awesome in both 5.1 and 2.0 surround sound.<br />I know that my two younger daughters are going to love having this DVD in our collection as they absolutely love her music. My youngest daughter loves Honey I'm Home and she was so disappointed when it wasn't played on TV. Now, she can dance all she wants as she loves to gallop around the room to it. This just shows the effect that Shania's music can have on even the youngest of listeners, and I do not have any qualms letting my daughters listen to Shania as I would with Brittany Spears.<br />Get this DVD and she why Shania is as popular as she is, regardless of what the critics in Nashville and abroad have to say. I say they're just jealous that she has such a huge and loyal following from different regions of the world.<br />Shania and this concert can go nowhere but Up!1 and 2.0 surround sound.<br />I know that my two younger daughters are going to love having this DVD in our collection as they absolutely love her music.

B00006AW2S|4.0|Thank God that all of The Stones early albums have been so lovingly remastered.  And the CD cases aren't the standard glass cases either, they're fold-over 'paperback' cases.  And the sound quality?  It's fantastic!<BR>In 1965, The Stones were on a roll.  They had already released three great albums and acquired quite a reputation as the hottest new band in the world.  This album proves that theory even further.  <BR>I swear I'm gonna scream if I hear one more person say &quot;'Satisfaction' is the best song on here&quot;.  What's so great about it?  The guitar riff is as simple as you can get, and the lyrics are far from brilliant.  The only real saving grace is Wyman's bass playing.  &quot;The Last Time&quot;, however, is a totally different matter.  Now THAT'S a guitar riff!  Here's a tune that I'll never be able to get out of my head.  And then there's the spooky &quot;Play With Fire&quot;, which marks one of the first uses of the sitar in rock 'n roll (I think).  I can't quite decipher what the song is about, but it IS fascinating.  Probably the darkest song the band ever did.  &quot;Mercy Mercy&quot; is a great album opener with a pounding beat and a fabulous chorus.  &quot;That's How Strong My Love Is&quot; is a decent ballad but nothing to marvel at.  Even better is the wonderful &quot;Cry To Me&quot;.  I simply LOVE Jagger's vocals on this one, and the way that he wails along with Keith's guitar at the end is awesome.  If you ask me, though, the best song on this album is &quot;The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man&quot;.  The song boasts an oh so addictive beat, like most of the band's other great blues tunes.  &quot;I'm waitin' at the bus stop in downtown L.A.&quot;.  I LOVE THIS SONG!  Another blues masterpiece is &quot;The Spider And The Fly&quot;, only available on the American version of the album, if I'm not mistaken.  This one is a Stones original, so no one can accuse them of 'stealing' it.  And Mick is funny too (&quot;Sittin', thinkin', sinkin', drinkin'&quot;).  The live version of &quot;I'm Alright&quot; is good, albeit the sound is a bit muddy.  And &quot;One More Try&quot; is positive, uplifting and, once again, A GREAT SONG!<br />And do you know what the scary thing is?  They only got BETTER after this.
B00009TB5G|5.0|First off, for those so-called \\"purists\\", I remember specifically in the Special Edition of FOTR that Peter Jackson stated that he and his entire crew wanted to make a movie \\"based\\" on Tolkien's masterpiece that would be suitable for those that have read the books and for those that have not yet done so and still stay true to the overall story. He has done that in my honest opinion.<br />Therefore, in the scenes where Merry and Pippin meet up with the White Wizard, and when Aragorn falls off the cliff, the movie leaves the viewers who have not read the books in a state of suspense. It keeps their attention and adds some adventure to the movie. For those of us that have read the books, we know what the outcome will be. To me, there is nothing wrong with this at all. The overall story has NOT been changed.<br />Peter Jackson's goal was to create a movie that would hopefully bring in even more fans to read the books and to introduce them to what JRR Tolkien had worked so hard to create: a world with it's own history, languages and people that pulls the reader in and makes them forget about the real world for a few hours. Peter Jackson has done that with his rendition of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. It stays faithful to the overall story, which is the quest for the one ring, and it's destruction. Unfortunately, the purists are selfish in their feelings, but they are in the minority here.<br />In this extended version of the Two Towers, new scenes have been added while others have been extended. Over 200 new visual effects were added and Howard Shore once again has redone the musical score as they did for the extended version of FOTR.<br />The appendices are excellent. The appendices in the FORT and the Two Towers are examples of how DVD's should be put together. Hours upon hours of behind the scenes documentaries exist that are not slapped together, but put into a logical order. As with the FOTR, you have the option to play all of them together with one press on your remote or to watch them separately at your leisure.<br />The Map of Middle Earth is back to show the continuation of the journeys of the broken Fellowship, which to me is a wonderful tool. I know that once I got into the Two Towers and ROTK in the books, I had a hard time following where the events were taking place and where everyone was traveling. Those questions have been answered with this DVD.<br />Also, there is a hidden Easter egg on the first DVD of the movie with Gollum and the MTV awards that is hilarious. Not as funny as the SNL skit on FOTR, but still hilarious. If you found the Easter eggs on the extended version of FOTR, then you'll know how to get it on the Two Towers.<br />I'm eagerly awaiting the final chapter, interested in seeing how Peter Jackson has transferred the book to film. So far, I must say he has done a commendable job. I felt that the theatrical version of the Two Towers telling of the various stories seemed almost too short and slapped together. I think it's because so much of the story had to be left out that fleshed out the details, especially with Treebeard and the Ents. However, more of that story has now been added to this special extended version and this, like the FOTR extended version, is surely going to please the rest of us even more than the original theatrical version.<br />This movie rates 5 stars in my book.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I bought this album not too long after it came out, and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. All the time its in my car or mp3 on my computer. It is maynard's best work to date. I am a huge fan of anything of Tool or APC and this album is my favorite. Most the negative reviews I have seen are from people who can't seem to enjoy a carefully timed and beautiful piece such as &quot;The Noose&quot;, &quot;The Package&quot;, &quot;Gravity&quot;, and &quot;The Outsider&quot;. Every single song is worth listening to over and over.
B00008WT49|5.0|They say that true audiophiles only like 2 channel audio- if that's true then they are crazy.  I thought that the cd version could not get much better in terms of clarity but I was very wrong.  The SACD 5.1 version can only be described as absolutely beautiful.  Jones' voice and the music envelope you in a wonderful blend of sound.  I highly recommend this SACD!
B00005JLD4|5.0|This movie is a movie that should teach people how to make movies. I can't figure out how to briefly sum it up but here it goes. I sat down to watch this movie and as I do any other but I couldn't move from my seat, all my senses were heightened. I forgot about  everything around me I was engulfed in this movie!
0385504209|2.0|This book does not live up to the hype.  Its a quick and easy read because the chapters are very short and virtually every one ends in a cliffhanger.  In between cliffhangers the characters stand around explaining things to each other with long verbal dissertations about feminine symbolism.  The ideas presented are old conspiracy-theory stuff, which is ok in itself, but I think the author reaches too far into the unbelievable (Disney? The Vatican is broke?)  The Big Secret is not a new idea, either.  The ending of this book is particularly silly.  I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it inspired me to learn something about the Council of Nicea on my own - certainly a very important event in history, but not accurately portrayed in this novel.
B00005JM0B|4.0|This Delightful tale of a man who must come to terms with his destiny is Americas Answer to a great film. The pulse pounding action is enough to send any person to the ER. I would have been nice if Sarah Connor could have been in it too, but i'm not one to complain.<BR>The special features are on two discs. I think that this is a movie  of epic porportions that will knock your top off.
0679428895|5.0|Harris, author of the acclaimed thriller's Fatherland and Archangel, has a hard task here: He must eke out suspense in a tale to which the final outcome will be known by every reader. Pompeii could well fall flat on its face, but instead it is a remarkable triumph. It straddled the bestseller lists in the UK for about 4 weeks, and should garner a similar reaction across the pond.<br />Its high summer along the Bay of Naples. The merchants are trading, the tourists are visiting, and the rich are lounging in their villas by the ocean. But all is not well...Recently installed Chief Engineer of the Aqua Augustus Maximus Atillius Primus senses trouble; springs have been failing for the first time in years, his predecessor remains missing, and fish have been dying in their pools. Everything indicates a problem with the aqueduct, a disruption somewhere on the sixty-mile mainline, on the Northern slopes of the great mountain Vesuvius. Then, one by one, the towns around the bay begin to loose their water supply...<br />One might think that because the reader automatically knows the outcome of the book (a horrendous eruption) it might be a little dull, but that is not true at all. Harris skirts the pitfalls presented by this potential lack of suspense by creating some great characters whose fates the reader cares about. Will they perish? Will they somehow escape? He also manages to weave in some excellent themes, most notably the slight shadowy parallels he draws between Rome, the superpower of the time, and modern-day America, and the subtle message that even a great power is irredeemably vulnerable when confronted by great unexpected destruction from within. In a way, he is warning us about complacency, but, more importantly, he is displaying how all the power in the world can not ensure our safety or complete peace-of-mind in this modern day-world, exactly as it could not then. It's rather clever how the book seems to reach across the years. <br />The historical detail isamazing, and the atmosphere - at first relaxed, then later full of fear - is built expertly. He makes everything so interesting. Certainly, I never would have believed I could enjoy reading about the workings of an ancient aqueduct! (Actually, there might be a little too much detail on the engineering ins-and-outs.) The pace is good, and the book is, often inexplicably - the beginning, the scene-setting, threatens to grow dull once or twice - a complete page-turner. It moves softly, until the final 100 pages, which are absolutely brilliant. Possibly the best final 100 pages I've read this year. Suddenly, the book explodes along with Vesuvius. The pace cracks like a whip and suddenly everything's full of electricity and terror as everyone flees and rushes about confused. Everything progresses in tense bursts and then aching graduality, with painfully slow descriptions of people trying to wade through thick ash, for example. It is a very effective juxtaposition. <br />Pompeii has everything: it is impeccably written, is crammed full of subtle historical information, it has death, destruction, undercurrents, mystery (the previous engineer went missing, remember) and even a little romance! As a thriller, I would recommend it highly. As an enjoyable education, I would recommend it unreservedly.
B00005JM02|4.0|Finding Nemo, is a delicious Romp that will leave you in stiches. ELlen Degeneres is a funny lady who is gaurenteed to put a smile on your face. I havent really looked at the extra stuff, but there must be alot of it cuz theres two discs. I hope theres a sequel, but what would it be called? well finding nemo 2 is ok if he gets lost again.
B00008US8R|5.0|I was blown away by Amy Lee's vocals when I heard the album for the first time. I cannot believe people giving this album one star. This combination has never been heard before, a hypnotic voice with guitar that sounds angry. This is beautiful music. I listen to the album once everyday even though I have very tight schedule. Go buy it now..you won't regret if you have passion for good Rock music.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I haven't been a big fan of Britney Spears lately, with all the nude magazine photos, so low pants, and bras she's been seen wearing, and also her stripper- like dancing. I wasn't so sure of this album at first either. I listened to the cd online at MTV's Leak and I didn't like it at first. The cd is only 50 minutes long, so I could listen again. After listening again, it grew on me, and I was dancing on the floor! You'll realize that most of the songs will get stuck in your head, eventually making you want to buy &quot;In the Zone&quot;. I especially liked the songs &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;, &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot;. The rest are great too. Even if you are hisitant, buy this cd! You will love it, even if you don't want to.
B000002GK1|5.0|The beginning of this album is like listening to someone revving the engine on a Ferrari and then peeling out, blazing down an abandoned highway, the song &quot;Rusty Cage&quot; blasting through the speakers.  While this album hasn't the polish of &quot;Superunknown,&quot; what it lacks in high-tech production it more than makes up for in raw energy and gritty, crunching guitars.  That alone makes this arguably a more vital and revisited CD than their other masterpiece.  With Ben Sheppard playing a much tougher sounding bass line mixes nicely with Matt Cameron's superbly timed drumming.  And then there is Chris Cornell howling his lungs out until his voice shatters.  Check out &quot;Slaves and Bulldozers&quot; to see what I'm talking about.  On that song alone it can be argued that he was and is one of the greatest rock vocalists ever.  This is simply a grunge-era masterpiece, and a phenomenal slice of heavy metal aggression.
0385504209|3.0|People either love or hate Dan Brown's book.  I seem to a minority falling in the middle.  It was an easy, breezy read that passed the time quickly and would be a fine companion on a long, but not too long, airplane trip.  The characters are rather two dimensional and a reader who scratches the surface of the data presented will find it about an inch deep.  Many reades are taking his theory as gospel, which is unfortunate.  Some of what he presents is plausible, some possible, but other parts verge on the outlandish.<br />Born has no background in language, religion, or history so his position must be taken with a grain of salt.  Some of the theories he offers can be found in other books, particularly the grail theory, but that does not make it true.  Other material on subjects like the divine feminine are interesting but often taken in places data does not justify.<br />In any case, people looking to learn the history of the early church should look elsewhere. People looking for a quick read that requires little thought may want to pick this up.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|This edition is far superior to the first installment for one very simple reason: the story is better.  Bryan Singer is an average director who sometimes finds himself in the middle of a very good script and although he tries very hard to ruin it with his mediocre talent, the story rises up and makes him look good.  Another example of this is \\"The Usual Suspects.\\"  I actually cared whether or not the X-Men succeeded this time around.  In the first film the only compelling characters were Wolverine and Rogue, and I'm still scratching my head at the casting of Ian McKellen as Magneto.  Magneto was a huge guy!  That said, they could not have cast finer actor than Ian, so I'm torn.  There are many memorable scenes, very few slow moments, and the weaving of character dialogue this time around works more fluidly.  After the first film I was reluctant to see the sequel.  After seeing the sequel, I'm looking forward to the third film with eager anticipation.
038572179X|5.0|It's the summer of 1935 on the hottest day anyone can remember and a thirteen year old little girl, who will grow up to be a great novelist, is preparing a play to entertain her family's guests.  What happens from there is a tremendous work in which master novelist Ian McEwan truly shines.  Both in substance and style, Atonement is nothing short of breath taking.  Through the narrative the author offers a window into topics ranging from Britain's fossilized class structure to methods of candy making during a chocolate shortage to the unspoken subject of sex in 1930's Britain.<br />McEwan further deserves praise for his complex and engaging character that pull you into the work.  Of particular interest is the author's excellent use of point of view, presenting an almost tragic farce as we see different events from a myriad of points of view most of whom fail to understand the reality of events.  Indeed, we see the depth of sadness that emerges when people assume that their point of view must be correct.  A sensitive reader's heart will break from the awful events that flow from these misunderstandings.<br />Lastly, I must comment on the author's tremendous ability to paint rich descriptions leaving the reader feeling they are actually present.  From the beach of Dunkirk to an aristocrat's estate, in every case you will want to stop and reread to experience again the beauty and depth of McEwan's language.  In short, any reader will be richer for the experience of following McEwan through this tremendous work.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Okay, so we all know what's really going to happen here.  Can the future be changed?  If we take all the other time-travel related films and analyze, the answer is &quot;absolutely not.&quot;  So, what are we left with for the third installment of the incredibly popular &quot;Terminator&quot; films.  Well, let's load up on the action, have some self-depreciating humor targeting that buff icon known as &quot;Ah-nold,&quot; and let's just have some fun.  The special effects are surprisingly noteworthy as well.  I was pleasantly shocked at how much I enjoyed this movie.  I seriously doubt I would enjoy this as much after a second viewing, the plot taking a backseat to the action and CGI, the characters not particularly likeable (except Governor Schwarzenegger), but it was a solid rental and I have been recommending that to all my friends.  Consider yourself included.
0156027321|5.0|Writers and readers alike continue to marvel at Martel's magnificent Life of Pi.  Who could imagine an engaging work about a boy marroned on a boat with a tiger?  Yet martel's inventive story telling, unique voice, and thoughtful asides grip the reader, holding him or her for the whole of the book.  Indeed, from begining to end one can only be awed by the authors tremendous imagination.<br />Some readers apparently found Life of Pi slow, I enjoyed the books varried pacing.  From page to page, I never became bored.  The characters, boy and tiger alike, maintinaed my interest throughout.  A truly worthwhile read.
B0000DZ3IG|2.0|This is a typical soundtrack for the record industry. The movie studio uses Natalie Cole's Everlasting Love all over the movie trailer, then the record company releases a soundtrack which does not include the one single song used to sell the movie to audiences. Cheap as usual.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Shiny.<BR>There is no way to say how glad I was when I saw the first episode of Firefly that there would be more.  Never have I anticipated each episode of a show like I did with this one.  The cast has perfect chemistry, and the writing is smart and funny.  Half of the joy of watching came from the excellent twofold or even threefold plotlines which ran through almost every episode.  The other half came from the all-too-human interaction between the crew members.<BR>One of the greatest things about this show is its realism.  It doesnt ask you to believe in alien races or strange multi-dementional space phenomena, it just asks you to believe that life would be harder the farther you get from the Central Planets, and you might have to take a dirty job or two to stay alive.  <BR>The death of this show first sent me into a rage, then into depression, as I realized that the TV execs were completely out of their gourd, and did not have faith in truly excellent TV when some idiot with a Nielsons card decides to watch Jerry Springer instead, or if...heaven forbid...someone might want to do something other than watch TV at 7:30 on Friday night.<BR>Since it was cut, I have been awaiting this box set, and praying that FOX would have enough sense to release it.  Thank goodness, they did.<BR>BUY IT.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|So this is Let It Be &quot;as it was intended,&quot; just in time to make a great Xmas gift for the diehard Beatles fan on your list (although must of us have bought it already).  Hmmm.... I actually like the &quot;clothed&quot; version well enough already, but this version is worthwhile too.  Many of the songs sound nearly identical, such as &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;I've Got A Feeling.&quot;  Obviously &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; and &quot;Across The Universe&quot; are starkly different shorn of their Spector-induced orchestral arrangements, but these &quot;naked&quot; takes aren't better or worse, only interesting alternatives.  All in all this disc wasn't the revelation it might have been, but I still enjoyed it and am glad I bought it.<br />The bonus material on the &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; extra CD is fun to check out, with several short snitches of rehearsal recordings and conversations.  However, I'm curious as to why was put on a separate disc.  The &quot;Naked&quot; CD is only 35 minutes long -- there is more than enough room left for the &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; stuff on the same disc.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I like this CD better than all the rest of Britney's work. She is very versatile on this CD. I love the dance songs. Now that she has her Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame I guess she's doing something right. This new CD makes you feel really good.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Take a look at the new Britney.  She's growing up, and her music is growing with her, and everyone who wants an awesome CD should get In The Zone.  It is a catchy, danceable CD with awesome producers, and Britney sounds hot.  I recommend it to everyone.
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|This is the 22nd cd I have of Celine Dion.  Even though I do not understand a word of French her voice is truly magical and the songs she has selected for this cd are wonderful.
B00003CWPR|1.0|This movie has the most juvenile plot that I've encountered since 'Swordfish'.  I can just imagine a bunch of 16 year old boys commenting on the cool T&amp;A.  I love quirky movies.  I enjoy leisurely pacing.  This movie is just dumb.  And Nicole Kidman can't act (Tom is not much better).
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Some reviewer said something about this album being slow and that she hadn't done anything good since Fumbling? Bah humbug! This was definitely worth the wait. Sarah is still the prolific songwriter and musician that she's been since graduating from the poppy sound of Solace. Marriage and motherhood have probably taken her away from the anger and distress that was Fumbling. And she should be allowed! Of course, I'm such a huge fan, I'd buy whatever she put out, even if everyone here gave it one star. I just don't find most songwriters today as insightful and consistent as she is. If anything, buy it because it's Christmas, and you've missed her on the music scene the past few years!
B0000CEB62|5.0|This is the greatest musical documentary of all time. Being a fan for two decades now, no other performance can top 101. Though the concert was not shown to it's whole entirety, let's face it, if digital recording is available at those times, we will not crave for more. For me, this movie has shown Depeche Mode at their best and how cool the 80's era is. A must have to all music collectors of different music genres.
B0000E1ALR|1.0|Sometime around 1979, Bruce lost his edge.  He never has since regained it for almost 25 years now.  Although he was never gifted with a good voice he made do with a working class theme that seemed believable and genuine. <br />All we seem to get from him after that period were sloppy and repetetitive lyrics, simple songs with catch phrases and an overwhelming urge to bilk the puplic with gimmicks.  Many of his songs now, seem to be about a victim or group of victims he wants us to believe he cares about. But in reality (if you pay attention) he seems to care more about his wallet then anything else.  The \\"Rising\\" was an example of this in it's most sickening form.  <br />I would reccomend that from the album \\"The River\\" and on, you should stay away from his work. More then two thirds of this collection are from that period.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is such a risky move for Brit; instead of doing a save bet on hip hop tunes like other artists have, she instead delivers an awesome album  that has songs for every taste.<br />1. Me against the music ft Madonna The first single is a terrific sond with music goddes Madonna. The track is very catchy and danceable. 5/5<BR>2. (I got that) Boom Boom ft Ying Yang Twins The second single is a little hiphop and a little contry with the funky banjo and is also a very danceable track. 5/5<BR>3. Showdown  Again this track is very club oriented but catchy as well; very good. 5/5<BR>4. Breathe on me  A very... track that's great for slow/fast dancing 5/5<BR>5. Early Mornin A very nice track but Brit voice isn't very recognisable in in the chorus but still very good. Produced by Moby 4/5<BR>6. Toxic The best beat in the album and Brit experiments with her voice. 5/5<BR>7. Outrageous Produced by R. Kelly a very good song 4/5<BR>8. Touch of my hand A very probocative song but very good. 5/5<BR>9. The hook up One of my favorites totally for wild dancing. 5/5<BR>10. Shadow A very pop song but still good 4/5<BR>11. Brave new girl Very pop also but danceable and fun 5/5<BR>12. Everytime The best ballad she has sang with awesome music and lyrics. 5/5<br />This cd is really one of the best of the year and I would recommmend it to anyone. What are you wating for? Go and buy it!!
B000060P79|5.0|This is a great CD and I recieved it in great condition!  I would order from RetroDisc again!  I love it!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|They don't make them like this anymore! Sergio Leone's love of the U.S. and in particular, the &quot;old west&quot; is readily apparent in this cinematic masterpiece. Unlike Leone's wonderful &quot;dollar&quot; pictures, this is a true Western with all of the elements that define it: a frontier between civilization and the wilderness, the civilized folk in peril, and a hero who must save them by employing the same skills as those who threaten and then take his dangerous skills away with him to the next frontier when the peril is over (e.g., Shane is an archetype of the true Western).<br />What makes this a highly unique film is that Leone gives us two heroes, one that fits the myth of the Old West in Harmonica (Charles Bronson) by being larger and better than life, and a more realistic hero with both good and bad qualities, Cheyenne (Jason Robards). One in (dusty) white, the other in earth tones. One who goes off into the sunset, light shining on him through the door as he leaves, and one who exits the way that all humans eventually do, without grandeur. The Morricone soundtrack is nothing short of amazing and you'll want to crank this movie through your stereo or home theater system for sure! Henry Fonda, who usually played heroes, turns in a terrific performance as one of the most evil screen villains ever. This film is required viewing for all film buffs and &quot;students&quot; of the Western and it's so rich in its imagery and dialogue you'll catch something new each time you watch it. Although most of the film was shot in Europe, keep your eyes open for director Leone's homage to the Western films of John Ford: he came all the way to the U.S. just to film one brief scene in Monument Valley!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is defintely a showcase of Britney's best yet.  She has shed her pop-princess image and has become someone who people can really relate to.  This album is certainly not for her 10-year-old fans though.  It is for the people who have been with her since the beginning and now understand the meaning of the... references in the songs.  This is nothing like her other albums so be sure to expect a variey of beats, from the classic pop of \\"Brave New Girl\\", to the funky \\"Toxic\\", and the 80's/90's feeling of \\"Breathe on Me\\".  I reccomend this album for anyone over the age of 13 who likes good music.  My favorite tracks are \\"Boom Boom\\", \\"Me Against the Music\\", \\"Everytime\\",  \\"Toxic\\", \\"Brave New Girl\\", and \\"Breathe on Me\\".
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm not even a Britney fan but I love this CD.  The songs are unique and catchy.  I especially like Toxic which is powerful and fun.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is Britney Spears' fourth album, and by far her best work yet!<BR>This album is a lot more adult, but also a lot more up beat.  Most of all the songs have a rich deep base rythem, and are excellent to dance to. The best songs on this album by far are: Breathe On Me (a deffinate disco/hiphop beat - to get your blood flowing), Toxic (R&amp;B with Electric guitar licks), Outrageous (deffinate eastern tones with R&amp;B base bumps)<br />All in all this is the best album I've purchased todate. You won't be disappointed at all, and that's a guarantee!
B00009P1O0|5.0|Long ago,I was told  (or I read)  that Neil Yong hated this album, maybe because of his personal circunstances by the time of producing it. Perhaps that was the reason why you could never get it on a regular CD  until now. For me, that is one of his best. Two of the songs are really terrific: On the beach and Ambulance Blues (you should change your mind about this song, Neil; it is not a stupid tune: you touched the heart of many listeners by doing it; you moved my very soul!!)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|so much better than her last album.  she's definitely portraying a matured image.  Great songs...I'm definitely surprised by it.  I just wish she'll stop lip synchin.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Beautiful renditions of Christmas classic. Worth it just for &quot;O Come O Come Emmanuel&quot;... A must have!!!!!!!! Whitney's voice is in pristine condition....Simply amazing!!!!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|It's dicey these days with Whitney Houston.  You don't know what you're gonna get on any given day, but it seems that her much lampooned recent trip to Israel has done her some personal good.  This collection of Christmas chestnuts is truly inspired.  I was prepared to either like it a little or not at all, but I have to admit, it's a smash!  The album flows smoothly from track 1 to the end, as Christmas albums should, and the vocal performances and production are alternately moving, joyous, somber, and outright raucous on a couple of tunes, the hip interpretatioon of Deck The Hall/Silent Night and the monumental, percussion-filled build-up in The Little Drummer Boy.  This time, Whitney is spot on fabulous.
0385504209|5.0|Incredibly fun read from Dan Brown that once again brings back the main character Robert Langdon from his previous work, \\"Angels & Demons\\". This time Langdon must figure out the mysteries of a secret society before some of mankind's greatest truths are lost forever.<br />The story begins with the assassination of the curator of the Louvre, one of the most famous museums in the world. Langdon is called in by the police and the daughter of the murdered man to assemble and decode the clues left by the curator within some of Leonardo Da Vinci's greatest works.<br />From there the reader is taken on a non-stop thrill ride as the men behind the assassination come after Langdon while he also attempts to flee the authorities that have named him as the primary suspect in the murder case. It is not difficult to see why this book has remained on Amazon's Top 10 best-seller list for months and months now. It is a fun read that makes you really think while you are being entertained. I can't wait for the next installment in the Langdon series. Enjoy this great read for yourself!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|ive been a fan of britney spears since the beginning of the mickey mouse club and i got to tell you on this album u can tell she put her heart and soul in to this music... u can really tell on  touch of my hand and everytime.. this album proves that britney spears will be here for a long time. this is the best yet. she has really grown up  if you are a britney fan you must have this album.
0802130208|5.0|What can one say about this book that would do it justice? It is simply one of the funniest, most well written pieces of comedic literature to date. Words cannot really describe it, you simply MUST purchase and read this book today. It is rare that a book can make you laugh out loud, but this book will do it over and over again.<br />The main character of the book is a slacker who is everything but that to himself. He brings to life the phrase \\"a legend in his own mind\\". Thirty-something years old, living at home with his mother, unable to hold a job longer than a week, he continues to make excuses and get himself into more messes than one could imagine.<br />The only tragedy about the book is the author's own. Not knowing that his work would go on to become critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winning material, he committed suicide before he had a chance to experience his own success. I could not help but laugh as I read the book, but be saddened upon finishing that the world will not be able to experience more works from a true writing genius.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|What can I say other than this is her best work to date! With razor sharp production entwined with sexy vocals make this cd a must have for any person who wants to get up and have a good time. Britney shows that she can take risks and they truly pay off here with an explosive (not to mention surprising!) colloboration with the Ying Yang Twins on the earthquake-like club anthem \\"I've Got That Boom Boom\\". <br />Britney also takes on the suggestive side of things once again with a surprising dance/trip hop track titled \\"Breathe On Me\\" and the middle easternlike track \\"Touch Of My Hand\\". Britney also proves she can tackle ballads with the haunting ballads \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\". <br />This CD is easily one of the best of 2003 and really showcases how multi-talented Britney can be. This is a must buy and essential for your cd collection

B0000A36J5|4.0|Greetings one and all,<BR>I must say that I'm a hardcore lOTR fan. This box set is great and all the special features fill my mind many times over. But there is a downside. WHERE'S MY FREE TICKET TO Return Of The King? I loved the fact that there was a free ticket in the fellowship box set but now we all get the cold shoulder for the last movie. Whats the deal there? Great Item but lacks the expected return.
B00006EXL5|1.0|Ok johnathon, Thursday has been around for quite some time. They had a little cd released before their Island/Def Jam signing called Full Collapse. It came out in 2001. They got big not too long after the album came out and signed to Island/Def Jam in early 2002. Now crappy bands like My Chemical Romance, who just got signed to Capitol a MONTH ago, are getting becasue the A&R department noticed Thursday's success and want to get their hands on a band that might make them money. Yes the cd was released before Thursday's War All The Time, but not before Full Collapse and Waiting. My Chemical Romance is an unoriginal, cliche band who is getting, and going to be big because a major label wants to make money the \\"screamo\\" genre. Moron
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago, a film adaptation of the Broadway Musical by Fosse, is brilliantly brought to life in this production starring Rene Zellweger, Katherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere.  With a supporting cast featuring other Hollywood A-List actors like John C. Reiley, Lucy Liu, and the fabulous Queen Latifah, its no wonder that this movie went on to achieve the pinnacle of fame as it swept its way through the Academy Awards this past year.<br />The story, set in the roaring 20's Chicago of gangster fame, is the tale of Roxie Hart (Zellweger), an ambitious unknown singer whose hunger for fame and fortune leads her into the arms of a man who promises to get her the connections she needs.  Later, when she learns that he is has been leading her to sleep with her, she shoots him in a moment of anger.  Her husband, unaware of his wife's extra-marial affairs, takes responsibility for the crime until he learns the other man is actually the same man who recently sold them furniture.  Roxy is incarserated, where she meets famed singer and dancer, Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones), who is also in prison for the murder of her husband and her sister.<br />The musical, which is filmed brilliantly in opposing counter-point of real life incident and elaborately staged jazz song-and dance numbers that narrate the story, is cleverly drawn together, blending musical fantasy with the fascinating story of these women's struggle for fame from inside the \\"slammer.\\"<br />Desperate to escape public execution, Roxy implores the assistance of Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton (Latifah), the prison headmaster whose corruptability is equal to her authority.  She puts Roxy in touch with Billy Flynn (Gere), top criminal lawyer in Chicago, and the man who is already representing Velma, to get her out.<br />The music is sizzling, sultry, sexy, as are the costumes and the actors that work these numbers.  One of the most impressive surprises in this film is that all of the actors sing and dance their own numbers.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is dynamic, performing like a veteran of the Broadway stage with a confidence that equals her talent.  She is beautiful in the role of Velma, and was perfectly cast.  Zellweger and Gere also nail their numbers, bringing a vitality and a sexual tension to their characters that make this movie work as a musical.  One of the surprise performances in this production was that of John C. Riley, who plays Amos Hart, Roxy's estranged and dumb-witted husband.  He brings a sensitivity and innocence to the performance that gives his character as much vitality as that of any of the larger roles in this film. <br />Running a little over an hour and a half, this is a fabulous film production of a legendary musical.   It is no wonder why this film has had the acclaim that it has.  It is sure to dazzle, entertain, an all that jazz....<br />Scott Kolecki

B00005JM02|5.0|Disney's PIXAR studios have re-defined the world of animation time and again with their many film efforts.  Such movies as &quot;Toy Story,&quot; &quot;Toy Story 2,&quot; &quot;A Bug's Life&quot; and &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot; have introduced audiences around the world to the potential of computer animations as a medium for creating the &quot;next generation&quot; cartoon.<br />But nothing yet compares to the unparalleled quality of animation, storytelling and pure magic that was produced in their most recent effort &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;.  <br />The story centers around a clown fish whose son is taken by divers somewhere off the coast of Sydney, Australia.  Marlin, father to Nemo, is an overly protective dad who will do anything to keep his son from danger.  You see, his mate and all their other offspring were lost when they were attacked by another fish.  So in a desperate act to save his one remaining child, Marlin sets out across the ocean to rescue his son.<br />The movie brings the ocean to life with rich, vibrant colors that are serene and immensely beautiful.  The close attention to detail in this film gives the settings, characters, indeed the entire film, a level of depth and quality not commonly seen in a &quot;cartoon&quot;.  The animation is so completely convincing that viewers often lose sight of the fact that they are watching a cartoon and instead they become immersed in the beautifully detailed world created by this team of animators from Pixar.<br />The movie has many wonderful characters created by a cast of all star talent.  Marlin is played by Albert Brooks, whose voice has so much inflection in it that he gives a vitality to the character that equals or surpasses the animation of his character.  Ellen Degeneres plays &quot;Dory&quot;, an absent-minded lady fish who serves as Marlin's companion on his adventure and serves much of the comic relief of the film.  Other celebrites making an appearance in this film include: William Defoe as Gill,and Geoffery Rush as Nigel, an empathetic pelican who helps save the day.<br />The movie mixes humor with human emotion, giving &quot;Nemo&quot; a vitality most animated films lack in this current medium.  The film is at once touching and compassionate, clever, witty and funy, combining tongue-in-cheek humor with a tender honesty that will make all audiences young and old a fan of this film.  <br />The DVD set contains enough extras to keep families entertained for hours, even after the film itself has ended.  Provided in this collection are both wide screen and full screen editions of the film, along with several shorts from Pixar studios, and a particularly memorable and entertaining short documentary &quot;Exploring the Reef&quot;, which stars Jean-Michael Costeau (son of famed undersater explorer Jacque Costeau), as well as some of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; favorites.<br />So, for those of you who have reservations about watching a &quot;kids&quot; movie, set them aside and give this one a chance.  It is really a film for all ages, with enough humor, action, adventure and entertainment to provide entire families with an experience not soon to be forgotten.<br />Scott Kolecki
B000002UAR|5.0|No other album by the Beatles more fully captures the range of musical styles they embraced than this, the pentultimate album of 1966. Along with Pet Sounds and Blonde on Blonde, the Revolver album showcased the maturity of the music of that year. After all the hype surrounding Sgt. Pepper (which has NOT dated well), Revolver has been lost amongst the shuffle, but it is truly the Beatles' masterpiece.<br />The year 1966 was one of change for the group: they brought an end to their relentless touring amidst a flurry caused by John Lennon's infamous &quot;bigger than Jesus&quot; quote, and Brian Epstein continued to be frozen out from the day-to-day business of running the band. The album itself came out in August, as the Beatles played their next-to-last live concert at Candlestick Park and returned to the confines of Abbey Road to work on the much over-rated Sgt. Pepper. But Revolver captures at turns the euphoric joy of the time mixed with the uncomfortable angst just underneath the surface. There are equal parts darkness and light, best exemplified by the running order of &quot;For No One&quot; following &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot;. Through all the emotional highs and lows, the band exhibits a higher level of songwriting (due to their often being high, literally) and musicianship. This is the dividing line between the &quot;cute&quot; Beatles and the &quot;psychedelic&quot; group. Throughout, the tunefulness of the album keeps the listener involved. There is no finer coda to a psychedelic album than &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. All in all, no Beatles fan's collection would be complete without it...
0553278223|4.0|I finally sat down and read this novel -- a collection of loosely-linked short stories, really -- and caught myself comparing it to the sophisticated sci-fi of recent years.  If I had kept up that mindset, I'm sure I would have rated it lower.  But...<br />Think back (those of you who can remember) to the days when the giants of sci-fi roamed the Earth: Bradbury.  Asimov.  Anderson.  Clarke.  Farmer.  There was something fundamental, something elemental, about their writing, born of the dime novel and magazine column-inch, that you don't have today.  That gritty, anti-Bronte sense where character development didn't matter as much because the writer's energy was going into creating a universe that heretofore didn't exist.<br />Bradbury's Martian Chronicles is all this and more.  In some ways, it is a Western, where the Martians are the (dare I say it?) Indians and clutzy Earth Men are the Europeans come to take what was never theirs.  Like all great novels, it is a mirror, a dark one at that.  <br />All Science Fiction poses a question: if the laws of the Universe behaved thus-and-so, what would the outcome be?  The Martians are a sophisticated and cultured race of telepaths and time-travelers, and are about to meet up with homicidal and self-absorbed Man.  What will the outcome be?  Bradbury doesn't flinch from painting an all-too-likely ending.<br />Four stars, however, because Martian Chronicles, while a classic, has not stood the test of time well.  It does owe almost too much to its noble and humble roots, and reads far more like a set of magazine articles than a homogeneous novel.  Still, it is well worth reading, and gives a good glimpse into the glory that science fiction used to be.
B0000C0FJB|4.0|Rush hit their creative peak during the deacade between 1975 and 1985.  The band demonstrated its unique brilliance during that decade, and Rush fans expect more today.  <br />The sound production quality on this DVD is barely satisfactory (use 2 channel pcm for best sound, not the 5.1 &quot;audience&quot; mix).  The show is great, the video quality is great, and the documentary is great.   <br />To please me, Rush must focus on getting the sound right on their future releases.  The poor production on Vapor Trails is a testiment to this.  It ruins what is otherwise a great effort.  Actually, none of the releases I have heard since Moving Pictures sound good.  Use The Camera Eye as a reference point for what a good Rush mix should sound like.  Great dynamic range, depth of sound stage, analog warmth.  It sounds &quot;musical&quot; and not &quot;in your face digital&quot;.  What else can I say, other than I net out as enjoying this DVD, and I can't buy a good lunch and beer for the $20 it cost.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I just checked out the rolling stone review..and it basicaly trashed this new cd, I for one think this cd is awesome. It's not awesome cause she's trying to be serious..its awesome cause she's trying to have fun for once, and that is what this cd stands for. You listen to it on the way to a club or before going out to a party to get pumped up..each song is filled with upbeat and crazy beats..she definitely showed us a partying, playful side of herself in her music this time around...i definitely give it two thumbs up cause it's just a fun cd to listen to!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|hey this is totally unbelivable.. Britney did a GREAT job with this album. She really got into zone..I am a big Britney fan since this &quot;baby one more time&quot; single but &quot;me against the music&quot; also rocks the beat! also she changes her styLe like not really teen pop a little bit hiphop too .. This is great and I recommend this brilliant aLbum to eveRYboDY! i love her second song in the album called i got that (boom boom) too. She is really cooL and I am telling this to all anti-brit fans : YOU ARE WRONG AGAIN because THIS IS MUSIC!!and now all you have to do is listen her songs.. you'll understand what am i talking about !..hey BriT i love you!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Music was a nice album, but it just didn't come together. This album does. Mirwais is again helping Madonna, but this time they get it right. This album is a great follow up to Ray of Light. Like Ray of Light, there is wonderful blend of techno and guitar. Madonna is singing about things that she knows and cares about.<br />Unlike Ray of Light, the songs are not instantly catchy. You have to listen to them a few times to really get to like them, but after you do, you'll be hooked.<br />The title track is one of her best songs, as is Love Profusion. Those two songs alone justify getting this album. Nothing Fails, Nobody Knows Me, Die Another Day, and Mother and Father are also great tracks.<br />I think most of the negative critism of this album is a reaction to the American Life video, not the quality of the album. This is easily one of the best albums to come out in the past couple of years.
0393316041|5.0|I've read this book probably six or seven times over the last 18 years, and each time the experience is different and wonderful.  I loved it at 11 when I didn't understand one bit of the math and science, and have only appreciated it more as I learned more and finally got a physics Ph.D. of my own.  Feynman had such a rich life that there's something in his adventures for everyone, whether you're a scientist, historian, musician, artist, or linguist.  Yes, there are certain things about the man that are less than perfectly likeable, notably his arrogance and his attitude toward women, but if you can separate the book from the person, I don't see how anyone can classify this as anything other than a 5-star experience.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|I'd have given Room On Fire three and a half stars if I could have. It's a competent second album which doesn't mess too much with the Is This It blueprint. Initially I thought this was a good thing (having privately urged the Stone Roses not to change their glorious sound, I was immensely disappointed by Second Coming, all those years ago), but having given it four or five listens now, I'll admit I'm slightly underwhelmed. <br />The trouble is, great as Is This It was, a large factor in its brilliance was the fact that we'd never heard The Strokes before. And now that  they've changed the musical landscape, two years later the market is not short of US garage bands with a 70s/80s fixation. So when the second album was unveiled, it was inevitably going to be judged not just against the first, but against albums by The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Kings of Leon et al. And crucially, without the element of surprise, Room On Fire simply aint that thrilling. It's not just that Is This It came first. The songs on Room On Fire are generally weaker than their predecessors, and this isn't helped by the uneven mix, with Julian Casablancas' vocals at times barely audible. There are, of course, some strong tracks: Whatever Happened and Automatic Stop show us that some of the old magic is still there. But the album has a slightly constructed, forced feel about it, and the majority of the songs tend to blur into each other with no distinct identities of their own. <br />It's not that Room On Fire is a bad album - if it was the first we'd heard of The Strokes and had been released in 2001, I'm sure the hype would still have been considerable. But in 2003, the ante has been upped, and The Strokes don't appear to have raised their game to match. Which is a shame.

B00005T30L|3.0|Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch star in this misfire attempt to film the graphic novel \\"Ghost World\\".  I'm not sure who this flick will disappoint more - those who've read the original and will nitpick over the differences, or those who have no familiarity with Daniel Clowes's offbeat characters, and may have no other reason to bond with the characters.   Like the original the movie tells of the what may be the end of a great friendship - the final summer for Enid and Rebecca.  With high school over, their ideas of the future (vague at first, but soon to reveal themselves as painfully distinct) may tear them apart.  Enid and Rebecca aren't so much as friends as two girls of similar age who loathe themselves and the entire world, but strangely not each other.  In their minds, the world is surrounded by freaks and fakes about whom they pursue, joke and otherwise exploit ruthlessly.  <br />The film gets the graphic novel's surface gloss right - John Ellis, Josh, the creeps who hang out at the \\"Zine-o-Phobia\\", the Satanists, Melorra, Enid's lame father, that \\"Weird Al\\" looking waiter (not played by \\"Weird Al\\" though) and that pair of pants that nobody ever picks off the street.  Now, Enid must take summer art classes to get her HS diploma.  A gifted cartoonist in the Daniel Clowes vein, Enid must nevertheless pass muster with a dippy art school teacher (Ileanna Douglas) and her PC students.  More significantly, the flick bravely tries splitting the friendship between Rebecca and Enid who finds herself drawn to another.  While the original Enid had desires, the flick gives her the chance for a real relationship.  In the book, Enid and Rebecca cruelly prank an older guy with a faked personal ad.  While the graphic novel victim dissappears in a cloud of anger, the flick hangs onto him - turning him into a luckless, feckless misanthrope with a name to match: Seymour (Steve Buscemi).  Curious at first, Enid gets closer to Seymour determined to help guide the guy to a real relationship, one apart from the losers who share his love of old 78 records.  Determined to use her powers for good and not evil, Enid becomes determined get Seymour snagged.  Unfortunately, when efforts prove successful, and Seymour improbably snags the woman of his dreams, Enid begins to realize her own feelings for Seymour.  Unsure of what she wants, Enid's mixed-up life begins to strain her relationship with Rebecca (with whom she's apartment hunting) and her art classes (which she must take to graduate HS).  <br />\\"Ghost\\" the graphic novel was an enigma, a grab bag of mixed-up tricks and treats.  The flick seems impenetrable, unfortunately to the guys who wrote it, and it's not as sucessful at turning the original's episodic storyline into a coherent narartive.  Seymour's painfully underwritten, especially given Buscemi's normal gift for banter - and nothing explains why Enid's attracted to him.  He ofcourse finds her beautiful, which is a problem - Enid wasn't supposed to be beautiful.  Not to be true to the original for the sake of authenticity, but Thora Birch is simply too radiant (if malevolently so) and youthful to play the self-loathing Enid.  Enid's secret desire is to suddenly become someone else and leave home forever.  In the novel, that works, but it doesn't seem to go with the rest of the movie, making the final shot (or panel) look forced - what is she supposed to be running from.  The flick also suffers the loss of Bob Skeetes, a mysterious seer whose few appearances in the story are more than compensated by the presence he casts over Enid's world.<br />IN SUM: If you never read GW, you'll probably spend most of your time just scratiching your head.  If you loved GW so much that you'll do anything to see Thora Birch say \\"Joey McCobb, he's our god!!\\" this is your flick.
B00005JM0B|5.0|After 12 years, Arnold worked out to hit the same body mass and weight he was in T3. He also broke a few bones(collarbone, etc) during production also. Sure he made $30 million, but he did his best for the fans. No matter if T3 wasn't directed by Cameron, Mostow does an excellent job while paying due respect to the film's predecessors and he also brings his own style and brilliance to the film. As the character of John Connor, Stahl doesn't portray a leader of the future we'd expect but in the timeline of the overall arc he's still a drifter only reaching the most crucial point in his life at the end of this installment. The best action/sci-fi movie since the first Matrix.<BR>Don't miss it.
B000002L6P|5.0|I love this album my favorite song is the last one stay I don't know what it is but I can't stop listening to it. Madonna does a really good job on this album and I'm glad she is still around and making a name for herself no one can do what she is doing and if you ask me.This is the cd to start from if you are a new Madonna fan because you won't be disappointed it has all of the elements right their and it just a great album.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|With slick production, catchy hooks and excellent experimental beats, this may be the best Britney, Inc. album to date. With little traditional pop fare, 'Me Against the Music' is NOT representative of the material on this largely dance-infused compilation. The two strongest tracks on this album are probably the two best Britney songs I have ever heard, these being 'Toxic' and 'Brave New Girl'. The Rishi Rich mix of the Madonna-duet rocks, and collaborations with the Ying Yang Twins (Boom Boom), as well as Moby's 'Early Mornin' are all great dance tracks. 'Breath on Me' and 'The Hook Up' are two other strong dance-pop tracks. This album is up there with Madonna's 'Erotica' and Janet Jackson's 'Rythm Nation' as a dance compilation you'll be playing for a long time.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink 182 delivers a awsome rock album it just get you pumped and like to can take on the world. Great job guys.
B0000CAQ26|4.0|Great album, but once again U.S. consumers are ripped off. The international version includes her hit from Charlie's Angels 2 &quot;Feel Good Time,&quot; which wasn't even released as a single in the U.S., and isn't on the American version of this album.<BR>Other than that, Pink is in fine form, excellent album through and through. In a horrible world of Britney Spears and American Idol phonies, thank God for Pink, a true artist.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This album(cd of course) is all-new in the sense that these are versions that were either unavailable before now or unheard before now. The clarity of For You Blue! The versions of Don't Let Me Down and Across the Universe are new and revelatory.  []These boys really were (are) the best in Rock/Pop.The tinkling piano throughout is definitely new. All sound great and I love the sequencing. I do miss the cute intros as on the previous version though. Everyone should have this one. Although not the best (Revolver or White Album or Rubber Soul or Pepper), it is in the top 6. I remember running out to get the Beatle's latest thirty or more years ago. This one deserves some running too.
0375703764|5.0|An astute reader can come to gauge a writer through what he produces. And if this is so for &quot;House of Leaves, then Mark Danielewski is a swirling mixture of the mad and the magnificent. This book is unlike any other that I have ever read -- hard and surreal, strange and magnificent.<br />Will Navidson moves into a house with a secret, a door that leads into a bizarre tangle of stairways and passages. After his experiences are put down in the Navidson Record, a blind man named Zampan&ograve; makes further studies of the house -- and then the tattoo artist Johnny Truant, after Zampan&ograve;'s death.As the reader goes deeper into the house (the word &quot;house&quot; isusually printed in blue), reality and perception start to warp...<br />Trying to explain &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is like trying to explain &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; in one sentence. Summarizing is hard enough; summarizing it briefly is virtually impossible. But if the actual story of &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is fantastic, then the way it's written is even better.It's sprinkled with anecdotes, letters (often with crossed-out lines), footnotes, lists, appendices, and pseudo-interview snippets from people like Anne Rice, Camille Paglia, David Copperfield, Stephen King, and Stanley Kubrick. There are pages that are entirely blotted out, or have only a single word, or are printed upside-down, sideways, tilted, running into a mess of letters, or in a spiral. There is poetry, pictures of tattered pages, musical notes, collages and paintings.<br />Danielewski's style is amazing. It's in flux -- some parts of it, in keeping with who wrote it, are dry and flat (Zampan&ograve;), and some are more casual (Truant). But as the book grows darker and more surreal, it doesn't alienate -- instead, it draws you in and warps how you see the world for just a little while, as if the book is reaching out of its pages to grab the reader's brain. Almost like the house, one might say.<br />The kind of terror and horror in &quot;House of Leaves&quot; are not the kind you read in hack horror books, where something transforms or a nasty thing leaps out of the shadows and eviscerates screaming extras. It's a creeping, subtle thing, like oil dripping over the surface of a pond. It's like a hallucination, surreal and continually shifting, where the laws of physics don't apply.<br />This genre-busting post-modernist book is like taking a rollercoaster through a Dali-designed funhouse. Alone in its genre, it's a work of art. It will scare you, twist you, and linger in your mind without cheap tricks or flashy devices.

0446530891|4.0|Like many of the reviewers here, I too have an affinity for &quot;all books Baldacci.&quot; And, while I admit Mr. Baldacci has penned a few a novels which stand alone, I cannot bring myself to say his new offering, SPLIT SECOND, is not a thrilling, fun read. Baldacci has an impressive skill of weaving subplots in and out of his storyline controlling the reader's focus until he decides to change directions...typically in mid-thought. This skill is what makes Baldacci an up-and-coming star in the literary field. And while SPLIT SECOND won't rival TOTAL CONTROL or ABSOLUTE POWER, it is a book well worth it's price.<br />As in several of his other books, Baldacci spins the storyline of SPLIT SECOND around the Secret Service. Baldacci links two crimes separated by eight years and brings together two publicly disgraced Secret Service agents to solve their respective mysteries. Eight years earlier, Agent Sean King was guarding a presidential candidate and took his eyes off the candidate for a split second, a split second that changed King's life forever and ended the life of the candidate.<br />Current day...Agent Michelle Maxwell allows a presidential candidate to override the Service's chief mandate of never losing track of a subject. The result, while not as final as King's, is just as disastrous...Maxwell's subject is kidnapped. Unbeknownst to King and Maxwell, these two agents lives will become linked by two separate and ostensibly unrelated crimes all due to a &quot;split second&quot; hesitation. One candidate is dead, the other missing, and two careers are seemingly trashed.<br />Though she's been put on leave and publicly vilified, Maxwell is determined to find her missing candidate. The similarity between what happened to her and King's situation eight years earlier leads her to believe there could be a link, or at least clues to assist her in solving the crime. In the meantime, King has used the proceeds of a libel lawsuit to go to law school, become a successful small-town attorney, and live a quiet, solemn life. That quiet life ends when King is reluctantly drawn into the intrigue of Maxwell's case and, his own. Joining the cast of characters and adding wrinkle to wrinkle is Joan Dillinger, King's former lover and Secret Service partner. Dillinger now runs an international investigative agency and has been privately hired to find Maxwell's missing candidate.<br />As the plot twists through one dead end after another, the subplot involving the two women vying for King's affection thickens. This, as always, throws additional emotional baggage on King as he tries to close the unclosable case. With unexpected twists known to Baldacci readers, the storyline throws curve after curve spinning this thriller toward its climax. <br />With SPLIT SECOND, Baldacci proves himself adroit in combining his storyline with poignant, tight subplots, developing deep, interesting characters, and providing &quot;edge-of-your-seat&quot; action leaving the reader thirsting for more. And, while the climax may not have been up to the quality of the storyline, this is an excellent read and is highly recommended by this reviewer.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|what an amazing artist. you will love his music. 2 very big thumbs up
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Wow! What a surprise. This is the first time I can honestly say I can listen to a whole album by her.  The teen queen has done what I think many thought would never happen. She has crossed over to adulthood and took her music with her.<br />The album has a Madonna/Kylie vibe going for it. Stand out cut for me is &quot;Everytime&quot; I just listen tho this track over and over.<br />&quot;I Got The Boom Boom&quot; will be a radio SMASH and &quot;Breath On Me&quot; will be HUGE in clubs. My other two favorite tracks are &quot;Shawdow&quot; &amp; &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;.<br />Awesome album! Good going Brit!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Este Cd de Britney va a agarrar la atencion de todo el Planeta. Es uno de los Cd's mas esperados del year.Esta muy bien hecho con pura calidad. Muchos ritmos nuevos y unas baladas muy buenas. Por favor vayanse a comprar su copia del cd. Con este Cd me he hecho Fan DE BRITNEY, porque antes no me gustaba...pero ahora me gusta su musica.
B00005OM4N|1.0|This album sounds exactly the same from beginning to end.  As usual, another Britney album for mass consumption by people with who are not picky about their music.  Waste of money.  It was given to me as a gift and I gave it a try.  I traded it in for a Cyndi Lauper album.  I bought the Shine LP.  Now there is an artist with talent!!!
6305537321|4.0|Based on Truman Capote's novel, this is the story of a young woman on her own making her way in the big city.  The movie starts by introducing us to Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) as she window shops her way through Manhattan. Paul (George Peppard), an author with a bad case of writer's block, is the new tenant in her building. The two meet on the morning Paul moves in, when he drops by to use Holly's phone. Soon after, they become friends.  One night, when a drunk man is banging on Holly's door, she climbs the fire escape and slips into Paul's apartment. As thanks for &quot;rescuing&quot; her, she invites him to a party, which turns into a loud, rowdy affair.  He again comes to her aid when a figure from her past shows up in New York.  And for one memorable day, they go out on the town together doing things that they have never before done, like shopping at Tiffany's and checking out a book from a library.  Ultimately, their feelings end up running more deeply than normal friendship but, when Paul confesses his love, Holly rebuffs him.  She has set her heart on marrying a rich South American so that she will have enough money to support herself and her brother, whose tour of duty in the army is nearly over.<br />While this is a great film, the inclusion of the stereotyped Asian character of Mr. Yunioshi (Mickey Rooney) is racist and offensive.  Mr. Yunioshi's sole purpose is to provide cheap comic relief.  What might have been funny in 1961 has long since lost its humorous edge.  Yunioshi's role is a double blow to the Asian community - not only is he dense and scornful, but he is played by a caucasian actor in heavy makeup.<br />(On a sidenote.. the main role was originally intended for Marilyn Monroe)
B0000C7PQK|3.0|Okay now, I take offense on past reviews on this one cause: I don't have to enjoy pointless Pop music such as N'sync or Britney Spears to enjoy \\"Boum-Boum\\", cause I do not.  Indeed it is the \\"shocker\\" of this album because of it's Pop-friendly lyrics...and my jaw did drop at first listen...but it's clear that Cretu wanted to move away from the \\"radical-ness\\" of the past four albums.<br />The LSD collection was an ending of that time (religious/worldly struggles and the battles between flesh and spirit) ...and now Cretu wants to just enjoy life for it's simple pleasures.  It's an innocent turn as an artist, and ironically, he has already written a song about this type of change in the past.<br />Another thing I noticed is that Cretu wanted to get away from the gimicks...he wanted to make a \\"pure\\" album using no samples.  Cretu can go far with this...I think the sampling's time has passed, and he would be better off putting all focus on the music itself rather than the concepts made from the music.<br />From each album onto Voyaguer, Cretu's vocals are becoming much more dominant and there is less of Sandra...True, he is not the best singer, but he is not the worst.  It doesn't take an intellectual genius to tell he sings from the heart.<br />Techno has also surfaced into the set...and I'm not suprised.  I've been a fan of his since I was 12 years old with the first album in 1990, so I think I know Cretu musically enough...after hearing the ballad (Eclipse of the Moon) I predicted what was to follow, especially after hearing the first track.<br />As with every Enigma album, each track flows different then the next...everything is an extreme for him...so naturally, I welcomed this re-development. <BR>I do enjoy all types of underground electronic music on the other hand, so this album wasn't such a stretch for me...but unlike other people...I never considered Cretu as a \\"New Age\\" artist...I always felt he was unfairly pidgeonholed.<br />I wouldn't say this is his best,but I didn't complain.  In my opinion it is a must have for any REAL Enigma fan.  For anyone who was already dissapointed...all I can say is that this is only the beginning for him, and Cretu still has a long way to go...Voyageur clearly serves as an experimentation and marks the rebirth of the Enigma project, so I wouldn't stop listening now.  And for anyone who has never heard Enigma and would like to check this stuff out, I wouldn't start here.  Start with the first or the second release...and work your way up.
B00005QCVY|4.0|I sometimes wonder why this movie is shown at Christmastime.  I find it depressing.  Either way, it is an excellent movie.  George Bailey, who grew up in Bedford Falls, dreams of leaving it and making his mark on the world.  His family's business is all that stands between the good citizens and Mr. Potter, a rich miser who takes pleasure in taking from everybody.  After misplacing an $8000.00 loan, George contemplates suicide.  His guardian angel, Clarence, falls to Earth and shows him how his town, family and friends would turn out if he had never been born.  George meant so much to so many people; should he really throw it all away?
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I completely agree with one of the reviewers: &quot;You know what is sad, this CD won't get the credit it deserves simply because of those who don't like Britney, the media icon.&quot; Just to be clear-I am not a person who sticks with boy bands and pop music. The only true CD i loved from her was her first, because every song was a classic to come for ages. Her two middle CD's were a result of her transitioning to grow, and I didn't dig the Cinderella and unmeaninful lyrics- but this new CD, is absolutely phenomenol. I have that newfound &quot;Britney craze&quot; that i had a few years ago when she came out with her first CD, and this definitely does it. On most CD's, i only have 2 favorites. This one has it all. If this doesnt sell platinum, or triple,  or wahtever higher, then i dont know what to say!!
B0000524CY|5.0|To begin with, this movie is scary.  The newest version, \\"The Version You've Never Seen\\" is even scarier.  The spiderwalk is terrifying.<br />Based on the novel by William Peter Blatty, The Exorcist is a movie that will stay with your for a lifetime.  Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), is a visiting actress in Washington, D.C. who notices dramatic and dangerous changes in the behavior of her 12 year old daughter Regan (Linda Blair). A young priest, Father Damien Karras, at nearby Georgetown University begins to doubt his faith while dealing with his mother's terminal sickness.  When all medical possibilities have been exhausted, Chris MacNeil is sent to a Fr. Karras.  He becomes convinced that Regan is possessed and he and Father Merrin, experienced in exorcism try to drive the spirit out of Regan before she dies.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|well when christinas album came out and i first listened to it i thought OMG britney needs to come out with a better album than this to keep her star status and thats gonna be almost impossible and then i heard me against the music and i was like oh no its over i didnt really like it  but it eventually grew on me and now i have in the zone and let me tell you... Christina Who? lol jk i love this cd so far my fav album was baby one more time but i can safely say this is my fav now i was having a hard time chosing my fav songs but i finally narrowed it down to 3 so now lets go track by track<br />#1 Me against the music: well i dint like it at first but it grows on you<br />#2 (i got that) Boom Boom: This is my 3rd fav song of the whole album its a good upbeat song<br />#3 showdown: its diffrent but i like it<br />#4 Breath on me: I really like it its like nothing shes ever done<br />#5 Early Mornin: tee hee hee lets just say this song brings back memories<br />#6 Toxic: meh its ok<br />#7 Outrages: you can so tell R.kelley was present<br />#8 touch of my Hand: well this song hmm wow i let it speak for itself its good<br />#9 the hook up: My FAVORITE SONG in the whole album this song is great its got that regae little beat and melody its awesome<br />#10 Shadow: its an ok balad but it would be much better if she had that belching voice she once had but you can still hear the essence of that once oh so powerfull voice.<br />11# Brave new girl: this is the only song that sounds like it belongs on one of her first two albums its bubble gum popish<br />#12 Everytime: My second fav song i dont care what anyone else says this is the best break up song ever!!!!<br />#13 Me against the music remix: I think this is good difrent but good but the lyrics dont go too much with the music. <br />so in conclusion this is a great album i definately recomend it i think this will shut up everyone who says that she's not gonna be around for to much longer. Shes been here over a decade......and counting.

In 1996, he kidnaps Railly, using her to find the 12 Monkeys, a group of revolutionists that are planning to release the virus into select cities. But he is wanted by the authorities for murder and kidnapping, plus he refuses to return to the future.

0783240236|4.0|Spoiled socialite and notorious practical joker Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) is shopping in a San Francisco pet store when she meets Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). Mitch is looking to buy a pair of love birds for his young sister's birthday.  He recognizes Melanie but pretends to mistake her for an assistant.  She decides to buy the birds and drive up to the quiet coastal town of Bodega Bay, where Mitch spends his weekends with his sister and mother. Shortly after she arrives, Melanie is attacked by a gull. This is just the start of a series of attacks by an increasing number of birds.  The film has several attacks in which adults and school children are ravaged and the air assaults are frightening to watch. The dangerous birds' unexplained sheer destructive force is displayed in the attack in a bedroom where the unfortunate Ms. Daniels is trapped, and their determination to destroy every human in their path is awful to behold.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I was absolutely blown away by this album!<br />I've NEVER been a fan of Britney Spears. Teen pop is a far cry from the music I typically listen to. I checked it out because my little sister wanted it (I'm 29, she's 12). After listening to the lyrics I'm not sure I'd recommend it to the preteen audience, but this is a fantastic album.<br />There doesn't seem to be a trace of teen pop anywhere on this release! The rhythms are absolutely addictive. I know existing Brit fans will dig this, but I would highly recommend this for non-Brit fans as an opportunity to convert! The majority of the tracks are far closer to Trance/Trip-Hop than anything typically expected from the (former) teen queen.<br />If you're willing to take the chance and lay down the dough for this you won't be disappointed.<br />For the existing Brit fans let me just say that it still sounds like her, and is very catchy, but not the semi-innocent pop you've become familiar with. It's so much better!<br />I only gave it 4 stars because of the lyrical content. I'm not trying to be super-critical (I've heard FAR worse on the radio, but that doesn't mean I want my 12 yr old sister, and 9 yr old niece listening to it), but it's a pet peeve of mine. I fully understand growth, but when you've depended on young girls to buy your products it seems some thought would have been put into how much is too much. In a world where the lunatics are running the asylum it'd just be nice to have a little consideration for kids who want to support you.<br />Stepping off my soapbox...<br />As a listener (not prone to be swayed by song lyrics) I cannot deny how cool this disc is!<br />I say check it out.
B0000CFW87|3.0|I actually prefer the first CD to this one.  Although Groban's voice is terrific and the selections are beautiful, I feel that David Foster's overproduction drowns out the music, and almost ruins the CD.  It sounds as if Foster is trying to make Groban into a male Celine Dion, with overblown production numbers and 2 or 3 changes of key in each selection.  Most of the background is so bombastic that it is hard to concentrate on Groban's voice.  Groban and Foster need to let the voice and music speak for themselves.  Still a worthwhile purchase, and a good showcase for Groban, but too heavy-handed.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I am a great fan of alien and I was very upset when I saw that alien trilogy was out of stock.Finally I decided to buy these dvds seperately and I am so glad that I didn't. This boxset is every fan's dream and I am really looking forward to buying it. I am literally counting the days to the release date...Many thanx to the people who have contibuted to the making of this dvd.
B00006BTCA|1.0|In my opinion, Interpol isn't good. I don't like their music. I'm glad I only listened to it and didn't buy.<BR>My opinion is absolutely and completely valid, as is anyone else's. I kinda like the Post-Punk style but prefer American Hardcore. I'm well aware that Interpol isn't trying to play Hardcore, but I have some friends who recommended them as an enjoyable alternative. I was open-minded enough to give them a try. Their music has a little life in it, but not enough to get my blood flowing. Actually it's kinda boring.<BR>1 Star reviewer's have as much right to dislike Interpol and give their negative opinions as anyone who likes them and gives their own positive opinions.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The original &quot;Let It Be&quot; is the most uneven album of The Beatles' career. &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; strengthens that album considerably. About half of the songs sound the same as they did before, and the other half are markedly different. The Phil Spector version was overproduced; this one is straight clean rock.<br />The Good<BR>--------<BR>-&quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae,&quot; both very poor songs, have been dropped from the album.<BR>-The addition of an uptempo version of &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; was a smart decision. This is an awesome song.<BR>-&quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; &quot;I Me Mine,&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; all sound much better now that they are without Phil Spector's overproduction.<BR>-The sound quality on all the songs has been improved.<br />The Bad<BR>-------<BR>-&quot;One After 909&quot; and &quot;For You Blue&quot; remain on the album, marring an otherwise-stellar set of songs.<BR>-While the version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; that appears here is still an amazing song, I prefer George's soulful guitar solo from the previous album version. This CD has him playing the solo without distortion, and it just doesn't sound as cool.<br />Overall, worth buying for any Beatles fan, or anyone who likes straight-up rock and roll in general.

0553269631|3.0|At first I was tempted to describe this book as a tragedy.  After all, there is little to cheer about, few if any moments of true joy in this book.  But that's not the definition of tragedy.  Tragedy is when a sympathetic main character meets an unfortunate end that was either unexpected or avoidable.  In this book, Carson McCullers gives her readers no reason, ever, to think that her story will end happily.  There is a sense of pre-destined failure in each of her five main characters.  They all have hopes, dreams, and desires - some more noble than others - but none has an aura of optimism or promise.  As clich&eacute; as it sounds, reading this novel is in many ways like watching an unavoidable train wreck in slow motion.<br />To her credit, McCullers does an admirable job of maintaining the pace and rhythm of her narrative, despite the inevitable outcome.  As pathetic and hopeless as each character is, they each possess a strong will and determination to follow what is in their heart.  No matter that what is in their heart is often misguided - a fact that is painfully obvious to the reader.  Because their hopes and dreams are real to them, they earn the readers' sympathy - or at least the readers' pity.<br />But at the risk of sounding shallow and superficial, this is a real downer of a book.  You hope against your better instinct that Singer, the loveable mute who devotes his life to a friend unworthy of his love, will find what his heart is searching for.  You pray that against the odds Dr. Copeland will find a way to redirect his feelings about race relations towards positive, fruitful ends.  You believe that just maybe young Mick, full of energy and ambition, will pursue her dream of becoming a classical pianist.  And while you set the bar much lower for Jake, the drunken drifter, you perhaps at least hope that he will find a way to stay out of trouble.<br />Each pursues his lonely journey is his own way.  And through these journeys McCullers goes deep into the realm of personal despair, exploring her characters' pain in a way that is painful for the reader as well.  In the end, you feel like you have suffered with the characters, which depending on how you look at it, makes this both a well-written book and book you may be glad to put behind you.lm of personal despair, exploring her characters' pain in a way that is painful for the reader as well.  In the end, you feel like you have suffered with the characters, which depending on how you look at it, makes this both a well-written book and book you may be glad to put behind you.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Fact:  The remaster of this album contains the entire song &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; (approx. 45 minutes) split into two tracks.  The third track (not included on original release) is a live version of &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; performed in 1978, approx. 12 minutes.  The fourth track (also not included on original release) is an interview with Jethro Tull's Anderson, Barre, and Hammond, approx. 16 minutes.  The remaster also contains a copy of the newspaper that was included with the original release.<br />Opinion:  I struggle to find the words to describe this masterpiece.  If you are reading and are curious, I suggest just getting your hands on this and giving it a try.  If you like changes in tempo, changes in instrumentation, if you enjoy peeling away layers of music to discover that bassline that was hiding underneath, if you enjoy flutes, if you simply enjoy music, give it a chance.  And if you don't like it on first listening, give it another chance in a week.<br />The track performed live is interesting for at least three listenings, but pales in comparison to the original epic and will quickly find its way being skipped when listened to.  The interview track is a complete waste of my time and the space on this disc.  I don't buy music in order to hear interviews.  If I wanted interviews, I'd find them in magazines or elsewhere.  It will quickly be skipped over by the listener.  I ultimately had to make a copy of the song &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; on a seperate cd because I grew tired of having the interview taking up precious space in my cd player.<br />The newspaper that comes with the remaster is an interesting piece included in order to help the listener piece together the meaning of the entire song.  What that meaning is, I leave that to the listener.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Give me a break, this media tramp has nothing to offer musically and the only thing showcased is her own ambition and desperation on this CD.  A good barometer of how good an artist(and B.S. hasn't a clue what that is) can be defined on how they market their work.  If the music were any good would you really need to &quot;expose&quot; yourself? Wouldn't you trust your musical instincts and let the music speak for itself?  Well, duh, B.S. has no musical instincts and those of you who continue to prop up this lame excuse for talent in a lifestyle of the rich and shallow are the real losers.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This is a fantastic movie and the books are among the most genius novel series ever written. In fact, this is far from Satanic. This is a very shining example of what our world faces today seen through a different light (Read Order Of The Phoenix to understand what I mean).<br />This second movie is even better than the first one and is much darker. This one finds our beloved wizard boy returning to Hogwarts in his second year against warnings not to return but hears a voice not heard by his friends. Students are being petrified by the monster controlled by a being named the 'Heir of Slytherin' and Harry must discover who's behind the attacks at Hogwarts and discover a place called the Chamber of Secrets where the culprit is believed to be housed in.<br />This is such an excellent movie and a brilliant movie. Being a heavy-duty Christian, this is a welcome novel story series to come into my life. It showcases the bravery and the courage of some people who have special powers.<br />Definately buy this movie and ignore all these idiots who say &quot;Harry Potter is Evil!&quot;. Yerrgh!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|It is what it is.  If your a Beatles fan, you'll love it.  It sounds as the original should have.  EVERY track on this album has been cleaned up, no hiss or muffled tones, and the album would be worth buying for that alone.  A few of the tracks have significant changes (The new version of \\"Across the Universe\\" will give you goosebumps) while some have very minor ones.  It's everything you love about the original but much better.  Over 30 since the band ceased to exist and you still feel the magic and get the chills when you put on a Beatles album...  [...]
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's fourth album \\"In The Zone\\" represents her final transformation into womanhood. Not only has she said \\"goodbye\\" to her pop/bubblegum image/look/sound , but she has shown she can work with other artists.<BR> Me Against The Music - features her idol , Madonna (who lip-locked the 21 year old songstress at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards)<BR>Early Mornin' - was written by Moby<BR>Outrageous - was written by R. Kelly<br />She also expresses elements of her...(Breathe On Me & Touch Of My Hand), and heartbreak (Everytime). Britney wrote 8 of 12 songs on this record and it is Ms. Spears at her best !!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|this is a must buy! if you are a fan of the nu-metal genre, then this is the best album available. the highly anticipated sequel to the 2000's smash \\"Hybrid theory\\" does not disappoint at all.here is my individual rating for all the songs--<br />1.Foreword(5/5)-gives the idea of a work in progress and blends into the first song don't stay.<BR>2.Don't stay(5/5)-excelent song.heavy distortion and great riffs.chesters vocals are amazing.<BR>3.Somewhere i belong(5/5)-the lead single is one of the best songs on the album<BR>4.Lying from you(4.5/5)-Good song.solid vocals.<BR>5.Hit the floor(4/5)-Great rapping by Mike.very havy riffs.but the chorus falls a little short.<BR>6.Easier to run(5/5)-A mellow song. great vocals from chester and mike.<BR>7.Faint(4.5/5)-The second single.string arrangement sounds great.lovely chorus but sounds better with the vedio.<BR>8.Figure.09(4.5/5)-very good song. excelent guitar work. <BR>9.Breaking the habit(5/5)-Unlike anything LP has done before.great vocals.it has a great feel.<BR>10.From the inside(5/5)-the 4th single.great guitar work. the vocals enhance the song.<BR>11.Nobody's listening(5/5)-great rapping. nice vocals on the chorus and scrathes are excellent.<BR>12.Session(4/5)-good interlude but could have been better.<BR>13.Numb(5/5)-the 3rd single and a great song.chester sings his heart out in this song.a great end to the album.<br />Overall i think it is unfair to say that LP are not one of the best bands around.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Pearl Jam proves that they are the best rock band out there right now with this album. I know not all of the songs are new but damn they are all awesome. Most notably, &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;, &quot;Alone&quot;, and &quot;Black, Red, Yellow.&quot; I am however a little disappointed ed and the gang omitted &quot;Breath.&quot; I also understand that they can't include every song that they have ever done. I still give this cd a 5 even with the omission of &quot;Breath. Even if you aren't a Pearl Jam fan, you should buy this and if you are a Pearl Jam fan and you don't have it yet, shame on you! Just kidding. Go get it now.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|[...]the versions are indeed stripped, the sound is great. I haven't had the chance to listen to the bonus disc yet so I can't comment on it. Overall it's definitely worth it. Highly recommended.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I've been reading this reviews ever since the album hit stores last week, and although I must say most of the reviews are excellent as usual, I have been noticing some preatty harsh comments about TOT. To my opinion this album is another classic to the DT collection. The album is filled with heavy guitars, super doble bass drumming, and killer keyboard solos. Lyrically, the album has very good songs, specially &quot;Endless sacrifice&quot; and &quot;In the name of good&quot;. To those who keep saying that this album sucks and that it lacks creativity, well screw you. Let me see you play that guitar in the instrumental of &quot;In the name of good&quot; or the double bass drum section in &quot;This dying soul&quot;. Most peolpe can criticie, but can they hold their ground. For those who spected this album to be another IaW or Awake, well sorry. There will never be another one. And for those who can admit that this is a great musical direction and a great album, well enjoy the damn CD.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Just one year into the new millenium, an album is released that starts a buying frenzy, quickly becoming the number one CD in the country and holding that position for several weeks. Record fans clearly can't get enough of this group and it's FABulous sound, and week after week it sits atop the Billboard charts. And just who is the artist behind this FABulous CD? Eminem? Michael Jackson? An American Idols winner? Yanni? Nope, it's the BEATLES!!! Rock music's most popular band has returned from the dead (no, silly, not Grateful!) to prove that great music will always have a place in our hearts. But, you say, you already have most (if not all) these songs on their respective original albums. Get this CD anyway! I can't tell you how many times I've gone on road trips or driving with friends in the car and I put this CD on! After all, most of my friends know every one of these numbers, so the whole car is soon filled with song, the miles speed buy like minutes, and life is just that much happier!!! And what GREAT songs! &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; with John pouring out his passions over a hard-driving beat, &quot;Help,&quot; even more hard-driving and frenzied, pure soul on overdrive, &quot;Yesterday,&quot; the pedal-to-the-medal exuberance of the first ten tracks is slowing down, time for a nice, thoughtful breather, &quot;Day Tripper&quot; and &quot;We Can Work it Out,&quot; (later done as a marvelous medley by one of the great Lost bands of the sixties, Fever Tree), proof that the rock never truly stopped for the boys, &quot;Yellow Submarine,&quot; pure goofy, nonsensical fun as eveybody makes silly sound effects and talks funny, &quot;Eleanor Rigby,&quot; a relatively quick, quiet contemplation on the Irony and Fragility of LIFE, &quot;Penny Lane,&quot; fun in the sun in London (well, Liverpool, actually!), &quot;Come Together&quot; and &quot;Something,&quot; John and George's best late work and the best double-sided single of all time, &quot;Let it Be,&quot; theperfect capper, and &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; the perfect coda. What a Great collection! What's not to like? (&quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;). Seriously, though, with hundreds of thousands of bands struggling to produce just one passably listenable song, the fact that the Beatles could produce 27 such memorable tunes, and STILL NOT EVEN SCRATCHED THE SURFACE of their immense body of work staggers the imagination. So, get clicking! Purchase The Beatles One today, so that you too can go on a magical mystery tour of listening and singalong fun!!!
B00005N5S5|4.0|On my Region 2 SE DVD, purchased in Holland as IMPORT (so I expect it a UK version) sone scenes are definitely cut: <br />1)When Terminator has just got the clothes, the rain starts, and it runs upon his face, but he does not blink <br />2)Just before getting into the GUNS store, Terminator passes a row of TV-sets, which get distorted, as he passes them. <br />Probably the scene of murder of the second &quot;wrong Sarah&quot; is also omitted. <br />THis really makes me think soon we shall get something like Ultimate version with these two scenes. <br />If someone has a comment on this, you can send me a note to lebedev_anton@mail.ru
B000002HJR|5.0|I have many great albums in my metal collection ranging from thrash like slayer to death metal like cannibal corpse, but when i got this album over a 2 years ago it instantly became my favorite. This is the CD to spin when you absolutely want to get totally trampeled and bludgened to death by thick, heavy, monstrous riffs. Just slow ugodly after ungodly classic metal riffs that will stick in your head long after you stop listening to this metal masterpiece. These are also some of the most deep and coolest lyrics Anselmo has ever written with any of his bands. As much as i love Pantera, and Superjoint Ritual I still miss this Anselmo group the most. Hopefully thses guys will tour again soon or put out what I'm sure will be another great album.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|TOT requires patience. Dream Theater requires patience. Not a single record persuaded me at once, not a single one disappointed after further consideration.<BR>TOT is not brilliant. Especially Petrucci, a very skilled guitar player, confuses inspiration with - partially - stupid and senseless speed.<BR>Some songs like This Dying soul are simply too heavy, too fast, stupid.<BR>The very clear MEtallica and - how awful!!! - new metal influences are not to be overheard.<BR>But some parts in some songs are really good. As i Am, Stream of consciouness, or In the name of god.<BR>Dream Theater has released a good, not a very good album which contains a mixture of occasionaly atmospheric parts, over-complexed and stupidly-fast guitar parts, as well as some Dream THeater (&quot;As I am&quot;, Stream, and In The NAme of God).<BR>A good, but the worst album so far.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I don't see why anyone should be even thinking about buying this CD. Everyone knows how bad a singer she is. She is the product of the record companies promoting the celeberties first, with music as an afterthought. So if you know that she is a bad singer, why do you want to buy this CD? Oh, she is hot you say? I hate to tell you, but this is a cd, not a Maxim or something. It has music, or so they tell us. Anyone could seriously sing better than her. If you want to buy something from a female superstar, buy some Beyonce, Ashanti, or Mariah Carey, but not Brittney.

B000021XS0|2.0|OK, I really want to like Dream Theater.  I really appreciate the talent on their respective instruments and in their ability to perform extensive jams.  But, I just don't get all the hype about this album.  It has no b*lls!!!  Actually, when I was listening to it on the way to work this morning, I began thinking that it sounds like a soundtrack to a Disney movie or a Warner Bros. cartoon.  It is so &quot;light&quot;, with no real emotion.  Almost like an elevator music version of Dream theater.  The extended jams are sooo boring.  Actually, the whole album is basically extended jams followed by a slow acoustic part followed by more extended jams, and so on and so one with no power or emotion.  The theme of the album, which apparently deals with a murder and reincarnation or something like that, is somewhat goofy in my opinion - I mean, do people really care about someone named Victoria and Nicholas???  Who the heck are these people??!!<BR>Also, I think the production on this album is really dry - it almost sounds like a computer is performing the music.  Once again, there is no soul or &quot;organic&quot; feel to the album.  <BR>There are actually 2 or 3 instances during the album where I get a good rush of adrenaline going, such as song 8 (can't remember the name right now - but has a Middle Eastern feel to it) but that's about it.  Really, I think Phish might have wrote some of these songs.  I'm very disappointed!!!<BR>Also, I might be wrong about this, but this album sounds alot like Pink Floyd - The Wall.  It even includes soul singers!!!  I mean, didn't Floyd do this album already, minus the boring as hell jam parts?  Maybe David Gilmore didn't feel the need to throw in filler wankery parts because the songs carried the Wall.<BR>But, hey, this is just my opinion.  Maybe other people get inspiration from this dry nonsense, but personally, I won't listen to it in my car anymore because I start falling asleep!!  You see, Dream Theater to me should and is what they sound like in their last album - Train of Thought.  That album has so much emotion and power, and, unlike SFAM, it has an &quot;organic&quot; human feel to it.  I'm glad DT have strayed away from that airy new age stuff - hopefully it will be permanent.  We'll see.<BR>My recommendation:  DON'T buy this album if you are looking for a good progressive metal album.  DO buy this album if you like Phish.

0553277472|3.0|A lot of people have noted that this book inspires love-it-or-hate-it reactions.  I'm not sure whether I'm an exception to the rule or somehow just in both camps at once.  There were some parts of this book which I found fascinating and wonderful.  There were other parts which I found interminable and uninspiring.<br />Am I sorry I read the book?  No, I think that in sum it was a worthwhile experience.  Would I rush to read it again?  No, I wouldn't, and I would offer only a qualified recommendation to anyone who asked if they should read this book.  I would tell them that if they were willing to be patient and were willing to allot a significant chunk of time to the book then they would almost certainly get something out of it and they would have enhanced, in some small way, their general cultural literacy.
B0000DJE9R|2.0|A album including #1 hits in the US and UK should include ALL the number #1 hits although one can understand why &quot;Say Say Say&quot; isn't on the cd (bad blood between Michael and Paul).  Instead this collection features some #1s and songs that didn't make it to that position on either the US or UK charts.  A perfect track listing for a #1s set for MJ would consist of the following songs:  Ben; Don't Stop Till You Get Enough; Rock With You; Billie Jean (12&quot; version); Beat It; I Just Can't Stop Loving You; Bad (12&quot; version); The Way You Make Me Feel (12&quot; version); Man In The Mirror; Dirty Diana; Another Part of Me (US #1 R&amp;B hit--12&quot; version); Black or White; You Are Not Alone; Earth Song (UK #1); Blood On The Dance Floor (UK #1); One More Chance (New song) and another new song lifted from the vaults

0783225857|5.0|It's easy to think &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is older than it is. Released in 1962, the same year James Bond was immortalised in &quot;Dr. No,&quot; director Robert Mulligan chose to film in black &amp; white, despite Hollywood's rush to adopt the new Kodachrome II color film. Since the story is set in the 1930's, the classic look of the film adds weight to its historic reality.<br />Adapted from Harper Lee's only book, which won a Pulitzer prize, the script itself won an academy award. Added to this is a stellar cast who manage to hold their own against the amazing performance given by, Gregory Peck, an actor at the peak of his abilities. For those who also enjoy Robert Duvall's huge body of work, it may be interesting to note this film as his first, in a non-speaking but pivotal role as Boo Radley.<br />It would be easy to dismiss an old film that deals with the race issue in Alabama. Some might think this topic has been done to death and, to an extent, they are right. But To Kill a Mockingbird is not solely about racism. It deals with honesty, justice, fear, childhood, quick judgements and parenthood. Even the race card is dealt with fairly, without blowing things out to sensational proportions. It shows that minor, selfish decisions, which rely on the racism in others, can breed larger evils.<br />An adult Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch narrates much of the story but it is her father, Atticus, around which the narrative hinges. Played with subtle dignity by Peck, Atticus is a small town Lawyer who agrees to defend Tom Robinson against charges of Rape. He agrees, in the full knowledge that many of his neighbours will hate him for defending a black man and still others will expect him to put up only a token effort. Instead, Atticus does what we know he will... his best.<br />There is an interesting contrast between what we see of Atticus and how his two children describe him. Apparently he's too old to do anything, like play ball, and they are a bit embarrassed by his quite ways. The trial and its associated moral battles put their father squarely in the spotlight and not in a good way. He and they are attacked and ridiculed but in the end Scout and Jem see a different picture of their old Pop.

Jem relates his father's instruction &quot;to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird...Well, I reckon because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy.

For me though, the film is defined when Reverend Sykes asks Scout to stand up in the court gallery, after a failed defence, saying &quot;Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passin.&quot;by his quite ways. The trial and its associated moral battles put their father squarely in the spotlight and not in a good way. He and they are attacked and ridiculed but in the end Scout and Jem see a different picture of their old Pop.

B00004RCNQ|5.0|I wonder if anime's roots started from this film. Hmm... very gory, but very incredible samurai sword martial arts. And I mean 'art'. <br />I watched this film over and over with my old vhs copy of it but am no seeking the dvd to relive my youthful (early20s) days of dreamy samurai/western flicks.
0788821075|5.0|Pretty Woman was released in 1987 by touchstone pictures has a running time of 106 minutes is rated R, and is closed captioned for the hearing impaired.  Pretty Woman is a movie that touches on every woman's dream of being rescued by a handsome, rich, knight that will meet our every dream. Roberts plays a call girl who finds herself employed by a wealthy businessman who needs a companion for several meetings. Gere is a cold, unhappy, rich businessman who does not want the entanglement of a relationship, but needs an companion to several meetings, and that is why he hires Roberts.  He finds that Roberts is more than meets the eye. He learns that people can be and are more than they seem.  All the self-serving socialites who will do anything to be his wife have hardened Gere. Julia throws him for a loop when she would rather leave than have him think she was trying to make time with his dishonest friend. Pretty Woman is truly one of the best Cinderella stories available for viewing today.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|This rendition of the otherwise failed hit package of 1996 captures...somewhat... of what Peter Gabriel is more than capable of.<br />My ghost has to travel and here it does...in spades.  The mixes are gorgeous, it's just that some of them are radio remixes.  I am not for certain, but when was Peter Gabriel last played on the radio?<br />This starts out with his landmark hit Solsbury Hill, and sends us into the world which Peter Gabriel has held us captive for so many years...it's a  good prison...trust me.<br />The editing in spots is a bit, well, selected, however, the sound quality is superb.  What I find odder is that selections from OVO and Rabbit Proof Fence are on this.  To many these will appear to be new songs.  They are not.  Even sadder, is that these classics were NOT issued in the USA.  Ovo, to me, remains one of his best works.  One hopes some of the songs here (the undeniably toned down live version of Downside Up for one) will prompt Real World to finally issue this classic worldwide so that the original can be heard.<br />One other bonus is the original I Grieve from the film City of Angels.  Unknowing to most, this one has more meat to it.  The remix on UP is a bit more subtle in the mixing of the percussion and drums...trust me, you will FEEL the difference.<br />A must for anyone who enjoys this truly fine artist....I did.
0385504209|3.0|it is indeed interesting one. although dan brown maybe use too often the knack of suspense. at the ending of many chapters he presents the surprise and cut. it is not a bad knack, but too often.<br />well, some flaws here. first, does the author determine which month the story happened? one place it said it is April, and near end it becomes november. second, why did Fache let robert longden go to the rest room without escort him? even with monitor, it is so un-professional. Third, after two trivial one, there is a big blow, why did the sibling of jesus and mary have to flee to england that time? because that time, according to the book, desciples treated jeses as prophet. until two hundred and some years later, when emporor constante tried to change the image of jesus as god, well, again according to the book, then there was danger for all offsprings of jesus to be eliminated. so why two hundreds and some years before, the daughter of jesus had to escape to england? besides, two hundred years is a long time for having offspring. it could be seven generations there. well, it is a fiction only, an interesting one.

B0000AI45P|4.0|'Marquee Moon' is one of those albums that not many people have heard of, but everybody with a credible music collection should own. (I also stated in my review of the original cd pressing that it should be an Amazon Essential Recording, but I guess they don't agree). Out of their CBGB contemporaries, Television stuck out like a sore thumb, even compared to the Talking Heads. While other groups were busy playing short, to-the-point punk rock, Television was mixing the immediacy of punk with the technical skills of progressive and jazz groups. The title track, 'Marquee Moon' is a ten and a half minute ascension to musical nirvana. Only the opening track 'See No Evil' has the jump-start effect of punk rock. Television were more about experimentation than punk rock. 'Marquee Moon' is one of the finest releases of the late 1970s, and among the top albums of the \\"New York scene.\\"<br />The reissue, on the other hand, has some good parts, some great parts, and some really terrible parts. It's good to have the lyrics now, now I can understand what Tom Verlaine is singing. It's great to have the story in the booklet about the recording, and the pictures inside are great too. The remastering is eye-opening compared to the original 1990 cd pressing, as well. Very clear, well-mixed and separated. Unlike the reviewer who was against the bonus tracks, I think that having 'Little Johnny Jewel' is definitely a plus. There's no reason to complain about having tracks that have been deleted for 25 years and never released ever on cd. The alternate takes aren't all that different from the originals except for a few things, some substantial (the guitar solo in 'Marquee Moon' is very different, also the vocals during the chorus of the song are given a huge boost), and some subtle (the ending of 'See No Evil' is extended, which is pretty cool). The packaging itself looks pretty cool, and seems to be designed to replicate a vinyl sleeve, but it's very flimsy and easy to scratch up. The cardboard sleeve that holds the cd also scratched the hell out of the surface of the disc, but luckily it still plays fine. I've had this for a couple of weeks and it already looks like it's ten years old.<br />Rhino did an excellent job with the handling of this reissue, from the remastering, to the liner notes and addition of lyrics and pictures, and the addition of rare bonus tracks. The packaging on the other hand seems cheap, flimsy, and can possibly be damaging to the disc itself. I keep the disc in a hard plastic jewel case to avoid anymore damage. My advice would be to put the disc in a separate case after opening it, or to burn a copy of the disc to listen to after you buy it to avoid any damage to the disc that packaging may cause.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|i totally agree that she will still be critised simply because she is britney spears, but this cd is shocking!  it is really...good!  shes finally working to her advantage (as most of us know her voice isnt spectacular, but this cd doesnt make that stand out).  the songs are very different, shes trying out r&amp;b and dance and i think this is a very positive change for her and will hopefully help out her image.
B000002UAU|5.0|let me take you down.....Sgt pepper is a universe created by the minds of john lennon and paul mccartney. the album was said (according to it authors) to have no underlying theme behind it yet it somehow contains some element of cohesion that you cant quite explain. the songs meld together despite the varying subject matter from song to song.<BR>It is an exercise in studio experimentation. limits are expanded as far as the eye can see. the beatles escaped from the box of conventionalism and practicallity and truely redefined the musical landscape forever. the journey begins with paul amidst a chatter of people gathering and an orchestra tuning up posing as a ring master to announce that the evening has begun and to sit back and enjoy the show. the coda is lennon's magnum opus a day in the life which were basically one days worth of news headlines taken from a daily periodical. the duration runs the gamut from dancing horses, plasticine porters to billy shears. arguably the album is probably their greatest single shining achievement and in the previously mentioned song perhaps their finest four minutes. the imagery is stark and vivid. the use of instuments like marimbas, sitars and circus organs were completely innovative to the music scene. paul said he was trying to challenge brian wilsons pet sounds to see how far the envelope could be pushed. the decision not to tour on the part of the lads allowed them opportunity to pursue their creative heights and explore sound. the rules were changed forever when this album arrived in 1967. just about any rock luminary can explain where they were and how they reacted on the first listen of sgt peppers when it was released to the public. david crosby has often referred to this experience as life altering. i still grasp to find the theme running through its lyrics and music but i guess thats what make a great work of art. just when you thought you have unlocked its essence youre forced to second guess yourself and decipher themeaning all over again. a trip without the drugs.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|This is by far one of thee best holiday albums out there now.. Whitney's voice has improved a lot since her last studio release.. All the songs are very good and she made them her own and didnt just sing them... The duet with her daughter bobbi kris is great and the way she changed the song is great... Im speechless cause i wasnt sure how her voice would be but its very good back to the preachers wife days... This is a must have album!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|i cannot believe how great this album is. There is every kind of musical genre on here (may be except rock). It the only cd that can really get up to dance. Its really sweet.<br />the hott songs on here.<br />Toxic 5/5: my absolute favourite! it has the sweetest beats ever!!! if ur throwing a party..britneys vocals are fantastic!!!<br />everytime 5/5: This songs really good. i love britneys vocals on here as well.

ITS THE BEST!!!!
B00005JM02|3.0|Not sure why this movie made so much money (except due to the lack of children's films in the theatres that summer).  Very ok.  A bit too much violence for younger children and the story is not that inventive (vs. a &quot;Monster's Inc.&quot; for instance, which is very clever).  My kids are a bit bored by this movie.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is incredible from start to finish.<br />The best tracks:<br />Me Against The Music<BR>Boom Boom<BR>Breathe On Me<BR>Everytime<BR>Touch Of My Hand<BR>Shadow<BR>Outrageous...<br />You do not have to skip any songs, but you will want to repeat EVERYTIME about 100 times. Let's support Britney and get her past 1 million in the first week! This album is twice as good as &quot;Oops...&quot; and that sold 1.3 million in it's first week! The best Pop album this year!
B0000027RL|3.0|The back &amp; forth message reviews on this album are fascinating, but aren't we all forgetting one band?  After all, everyone keeps mentioning the Pearl Jam vs. Nirvana vs. Britney Spears contest, and who is best and who sells the most CDs and all that good stuff, but what we're all forgetting is the Stone Temple Pilots.  After all, they emerged from Seattle right when Nirvana and Pearl Jam did, and some think they are a much better group than Nirvana, Pearl Jam &amp; Britney combined (me included!!).  <br />However, this &quot;10&quot; CD by Pearl &quot;PJ&quot; Jam is pretty good, and it shows them in a very mature, growing stage.  I happen to believe that the latter songs on the CD are the best - they're much more mysterious and less played everywhere.  Ed Vedder sounds angry, hungry and ready to take on the world, while his bandmates play some searing rock &amp; roll!!<br />Well, they may never be the Stone Temple Pilots, but Pearl Jam know how to rock.  If you can, catch 'em live - Ed's a class act, and an honest-to-God performer who truly enjoys being on stage - kind of like Britney!!!!!<br />SEE YA' SOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|I can't believe how GREAT this CD is. Everytime I listen to it I can't help but think that Eddie is in the room with me singing to me in a private concert. The only Gremmie that is out<BR>of control is in my pants when I listen to this great tracks. We don't get these great tracks of music in Malta so it's a real treat to order it on line. I only wish that the duet of Mansoor E Ramsewer and Ed Vedder was on this great disc. Just like Eddie I have opinions on everything from things Greeks in the Navy to cutting my hair in a redicoulous way.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney is certainly showing a different side to herself in this new album and it works.  Britney, who is often critized for her voice, makes up for her voice in musical creativity.  Her lyrics, beats and music all come together so well.  &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; is hands down the best and hottest track on the album.  &quot;Everytime&quot; shows a gentle, regretful personna. The song is simply beautiful.  <br />It is amazing to me that someone like Britney Spears gets critized for her voice when there are singers with worse voices doing far-less inventive things in the industry right now (ie: Janet, J-Lo and Kylie)!!!<br />Get this CD, it will never leave your CD Player!
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown has done an excellent job bringing to light new ways of looking at Christ as a human being.  Although nothing regarding Dan's primise is biblically subsantiated, it does lead one to think of a Christ with non conventional dynamics. I highly recomend this book to those who like to think and challange the conservitive convention of religion.<br />David C.
B000002UVZ|5.0|.....and it still does.  Regardless of how old hat REM may have become, they were a great band and have a lot to be proud of.  Their first 5 albums or so are well worth picking up.  Fall On Me, in my book, is their best song and this album over all is excellent.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|The Beatles were trying to get back to basics when they made &quot;Let it Be&quot;.  No more studio effects, just their instruments.  It was the way the began their astounding musical career.  Unfortunately 'Let it Be - Naked' sounds just like that young garage band playing in smokey halls in Germany and England: as if this album were a demo tape.  No doubt the cheesy studio effects from the original Let it Be suppressed, to some degree, the brilliance of the songs, and I'm glad to see they have been erased.  But Let it Be- Naked lacks more than studio effects.  &quot;The Long Winding Road,&quot; a song doctored with many effects in the original album, is now anticlimactic, and can't be seperated from the 'elevator' status of the original.  This version of Harrisons &quot;I Me Mine&quot; is a less likable truncated version.  I'm left thinking &quot;oh, did the song end? shouldn't there be more?&quot;  But the greatest tragedy of this album is the butchery of Let it Be, which could be one of the best songs ever written.  The distorted guitar solo is a cheap imitation of the original, and I never liked the synthesizer, which now seems to be more prominant in the absence of other effects mask it's sound.  <BR>Generally the album needs more work by the Beatles, not by more producers.  What doe we expect to happen with half of the Beatles dead?  Incomplete.  Unfinished.  Raw.   <BR> My advise, stick with the original, and dream of what it could be.
B000005IRG|2.0|Some of the guitar playing is okay, and there's a decent melody here and there, but basically this band gets lots of critics acclaim because they never had mainstream success.  Sometimes the mainstream has the wrong idea, and sometimes the right.  The bands from this era and &quot;scene&quot; that made it big were all better than Television.  This is an incredibly mediocre record, and that's all there is to it.  It's big with the name dropping hipster types because they can say, &quot;oh, you know about Blondie, but TELEVISION was really the best band from the CBGB era/scene!!!&quot;.  BULLOCKS!!!   Clean out your ears and stop being so pretentious.
B0000029DD|5.0|This album generall has an interesting mellow intensity that I have seldom heard elsewhere.  His voice is soothing yet the somehow dark at the same time.  The album is starkly different from anything made by contemporaries of the time; Counting Crows, Bare Naked Ladies, Crash Test Dummies, Maria Carey, Live, etc.  Although &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; has a U2 like sound.  <BR>What's even more interesting is Buckleys blend of the rock and roll with folk guitar styles, in songs like Lilac Wine and Hallelujia (a brilliant remake of a Leonard Cohen song), and a few jazz chords in 'Lover, you should've come over,' and hard rock in Eternal Life, a song that starts out like something on Boby Dylan's &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; but turns hard, almost punk.  Corpus Christi Carol is an interesting spiritual feeling song: picture it sung by choir boys. <BR>The album is generally intense and metaphysical.  It's very basic, with many songs only a guitar and drums, and others only a guitar.  I like it.<br />Highlights of the album<BR>&quot;Last Goodbye&quot; will quickly become a favorite on the album. <BR>&quot;Hallelujia&quot; - Different than the Rufus Wainwright cover.  Buckley uses only an electric guitar, and finishes with almost overwhelming falcetto.  It is a very different type of song but will become your favorite version.  <BR>&quot;Lover you should've come over&quot; - Also a nice song, somewhat remeniscent of Last Goodbye.
B0000004V2|5.0|No, they weren't reinventing the wheel.  But this album is a perfect pop album.  Period.  Even Smith's albums have throwaway tracks people.   There are at least 6 fantastic tracks on this album, and I'm not even including Fool's Gold, because I don't like it that much.  John Squire is a fantastic melodic guitarist.  There are a few things that were holding this band back from being huge 1) Ian Brown is a HORRIFIC live singer 2) they took 15 years to release their second album, and it sucked.  This band is what Oasis wished they could have been.

B000089RVX|1.0|Everything that's wrong with the mainstream music business in one band, one album.  Nothing but derivative, digitally produced RUBBISH!!  Sing more than a half octave range please, sweety!!  You're cute and everything, but please, spare my ears.  &quot;Wake me UP, I can't WAKE UP!!&quot;  Where'd that dope come from?  Kiddies, this band stinks.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|The music lost.<br /> I had the misfortune of listening to &quot;In The Zone&quot; through an AOL preview. Though I'm not a Britney basher, I must say the prospect of being one is beginning to look appealing. You know those albums that sound as though it were composed entirely of remixes? This is definitely one of those albums.<br /> While I was listening to Spears' fourth effort, I couldn't help but ask, &quot;Are these songs supposed to make me feel like dancing?&quot; Good music stands out. It doesn't become so lost in its own background that you feel like falling asleep.<br /> My biggest gripe is that the tracks sound so similar to one another. With that being said, it is both astonishing and horrific that the word &quot;eclectic&quot; describes the album very well. I'm not sure who decided it was a good idea to compile each and every song with as many rhythm loops as possible, but they have clearly misunderstood the concept of variety. I've heard more distinguishable music come from traffic jams.<br /> But I must say, there is one track that I thoroughly enjoy. &quot;Toxic&quot; is the name, and it's quite a diddy. Though I will pass on the purchasing of the entire album, I will more than happily snag the song on CD, should it be selected as a single. Please God, don't let it be released as a remix.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|It was weird because I got this CD at Target a day before it was released, but it was great because I was so anticipated to get it..i love britney and i wanted to hear her \\"new\\" sound..anyway I was kind of dissapointed..there are only like 5 good songs on it the rest I skip because they are just plain boring...<BR>1.Me Against The Music - Great song to dance to<BR>2.Boom Boom - Its OK <BR>3.Showdown - SUCKS<BR>4.Breathe On Me - Great Song to Get It On To...very sexual and very fun<BR>5.Early Mornin' - SUCKS<BR>6.Toxic - Best Song on the Album...its fun, upbeat and her best work on this whole album<BR>7.Outrageous - SUCKS<BR>8.Touch Of My Hand - OK<BR>9.The Hook Up - Horrible<BR>10.Shadow - Alright<BR>11. Brave New Girl - Good Song...You get used to it after listening to it a couple of times<BR>12.Everytime - Very Beautiful Song...This song and \\"Toxic\\" are my number 1 picks <BR>Overall if youre a true Britney fan then you should totally get this CD, but if youre not then dont bother
B0000DD7LB|3.0|As a longtime Britney fan, I have to say I was disheartened by this album.  After ALL the hype and the media blitz, I expected a little bit more.  That being said the album does hold some true pieces of pop perfection.  In those songs, we truly get a glimpse at what kind of entertainer Britney should and could be.  Here's the rundown...<br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC:  A slamming sweaty dance number that I'm sure everyone has heard.  Easily one of Britney's best songs ever and destined to burn up dance floors all winter long.  <br />I GOT THAT (BOOM BOOM):  On first listen, this one elicits a fit of laughter.  However something about the beat catches on with repeated spins and, if it wasn't for those HORRIBLE Yin Yang Twins, this would actually be a pretty great song.<br />SHOWDOWN:  The first true misstep.  As becomes blatant later in the album when Britney crosses over into R&amp;B and, even, reggae territory, the results fall flat.  A bubbling, but ultimately boring beat matched with inane lyrics.<br />BREATHE ON ME:  A brilliant, throbbing, and erotic piece of electro club sizzle.  Breaths, moans, and whispers slink around silky beats as Britney persuades her lover to &quot;Put your lips together and blow.&quot;<br />EARLY MORNIN':  A chilled post-night-out song.  The beats have a nice after hours vibe to them but the obnoxious chorus somewhat spoils the vibe.<br />TOXIC:  A piece of retro techno sped up trip hop fabulousness.  Just try to control your hips when the violins and beats kick in.  Impossibly hip!<br />OUTRAGEOUS:  Horrible.  Just bad bad bad.  Britney sounds like she's moaning in self parody over generic hip hop beats.  <br />TOUCH OF MY HAND:  The seductive club diva is back on this ode to...er...self gratification.  Again, Britney expertly maneuvers her voice in and out of intoxicating, deep house beats.<br />THE HOOK UP:  Remember the earlier mention of reggae?  Well here it is in all its' glory.  YEAH RIGHT!  I outwardly cringed when I heard this.  Have only been able to make it through the whole song twice because it is that PAINFUL.  <br />SHADOW:  I always make a point to never say anything about the requisite ballads.  Suffice to say...not a fan.<br />BRAVE NEW GIRL:  As much as I want to hate this song (cheesy music, Britney rapping), I don't.  It is toe tapping fun..and the chorus makes me want to spin in circles.<br />EVERYTIME:  See SHADOW.<br />MATM (REMIX):  Decent remix...but unneccesary considering the stellar original.<br />If you can get your hands on the import releasethe two bonus tracks ANSWER and DON'T HANG UP are both excellent and I wish she would have replaced OUTRAGEOUS and THE HOOK UP with them.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Ok, it's heavy... So what? It's metal!! I must say i really like this new approach DT has made in this new album. The sound is full of energy but as always it's energy from well played instruments and well arranged musics. It's complex, harsh but melodic at the same time. Nothing DT fans aren't used to. I have bought tickets to see them live in 12 Feb.. I'm salivating at the idea of seeing 'dying soul live'..<BR>As a drum enthusiast a can only say that mike portnoy has reached a level of complexity, speed, and precision that won't be easily matched by any other drummer. It really sends shivers up your spine.<BR>When John Petrucci has the opurtunity to show what is made of he doesn't disapoint anyone...He is playing at greater speed than in other previous DT recordings and some of the riffs are just jaw dropping.<BR>The other members are just performing the way you'd expect them to perform.. although i believe there was a lack of input from Myung and Rudess in the song writing.<BR>At a first approach the increase in energy and violence might make some musics a tad repetitive but listen to them carefully.. cause most of them are brilliant..<BR>Perfect? No..<BR>One of the graetest albums DT has put out? Yes! you bet!<br />Buy it.. you won't regret it
B00005JM0B|4.0|What I don't like is the moral of t1 and t2 was &quot;No fate, but what we make for ourselves.&quot;  While t3's messege was &quot;no escaping our destiny.&quot;  Although, the effects were eqivelnt to t2 the storyline wZs not t1 material.  More like CRUMMY matrix crap.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I was really under the impression -- from the advertising -- that this was going to be &quot;Let It Be&quot; completely stripped of all the heavy-handed Phil Spector crap. Of course, I realised the inclusion of some songs (Don't Let Me Down) and the removal of some (Dig It, Maggie Mae) however, Get Back, Long and Winding Road, Don't Let Me Down, and Let It Be are clearly not the same versions that were on the original album or singles.<br />The version of Long and Winding Road that appears on Anthology 3 is the same as the album version just with the crap removed. That is exactly what this album should have been.<br />This would have been explained in the liner notes but there are none with Naked. I believe that is why there are no liners note because it would have stated that these are not the same songs.<br />This is more like an authorized bootleg. There are thousands of hours of unreleased Beatles tapes and this is just a few from the original Get Back sessions. If you are a collector as I am you will notice these differences right away.

B00005JLT5|5.0|The Pianist is an amazing film on all counts and could well be the best film from Polanski and his most personal work to date. The best way to describe The Pianist is by sticking Robinson Crusoe in the middle of a Nazi Holocaust.<br />Holocaust films are always striving to get at you emotionally by creating good guy bad guy type scenarios. The truth is that The Pianist is not really concentrating too much on delivering a Holocaust movie. Instead it aims for telling the tale of a feeble piano player trying to survive Polish Nazi occupation. The premise is a simple one. The Pianist is not like his brothers, sisters or friends who are all actively seeking ways to rebel against the Nazis. Instead he is just trying to stay alive in order to engage in his one passion in life - playing the piano.<br />Basically the film starts with Wladyslaw Szpilman (An amazing Adrian Brody!) learning with his family that the Nazis are making decrees against the Jews. You see the elevating intensity of a rich family suddenly being relocated to a confined Jewish district and then the horrors start to build up from simple street provocations to full out mass murders in public view. The buildup is powerful and horrifying. The things you see in this film will make you angry and mad, but the Holocaust is not really what is at the heart of this film.<br />Wladyslaw is just a Piano player and can do very little to stop what is going on. He does not wish to join any revolution and tries to stay out of the way being hospitable and polite when he can. As the world collapses around him he finds his life spared from the concentration camps only to be catapulted from the frying pan into the fire as he tries to survive in solitary either with the help of Jewish sympathizers or by living among the rumbled ruins in search of food. Seeing the world through the eyes of Wladyslaw is what this film is all about and Brody gives his best performances when he is alone with nobody to talk too or anything to say. Just seeing him stagger around in search of food is like nothing you have seen before or will see again.<br />Sure the encounter with the Nazi commander at the end is a little hard to believe and it does border on the fantastic as if to create a musical plot twist for our pivotal character but then again it is based on a true story and these things did happen so it is believable in an unlikely sort of way.<br />At its core, The Pianist is a survival movie about one man trying to last among the rubbles and ruins. At times it is surreal and at others it is devastatingly emotionally potent. This is one of the best films of the 21st century and you should certainly not miss out on seeing this drama. The set designs, plot, script, costumes, acting and action sequences are all on top form. For realism it is simply unparalleled by any film of its kind.<br />Highly Recommended.Just seeing him stagger around in search of food is like nothing you have seen before or will see again.<br />Sure the encounter with the Nazi commander at the end is a little hard to believe and it does border on the fantastic as if to create a musical plot twist for our pivotal character but then again it is based on a true story and these things did happen so it is believable in an unlikely sort of way. <br />At its core, The Pianist is a survival movie about one man trying to last among the rubbles and ruins.

B0000AQS6R|5.0|Chevy Chase did it again.  Although this is the worst in the seris it's still phenomonale.  In this one Clark invites all of the faimily, except Eddie who shows up anyway.  He invites Ellen's aunt who's insane, i.e. wrapping up her cat and Jello mold as presents.  Plus, her husband who's like a souped up Aunt Edna.  All in all, very funny.
B00005JMFR|1.0|I am dumbfounded at how many people actually gave this film five stars. Imagine if Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Lea where all given bit part roles to play in the final movie of the trilogy and Jabba the Hut, a Jawa, a Storm Trooper and an Ewok where made the central focus characters? Would you like that? Well this is EXACTLY what Revolutions does!<br />Okay so Terminator 3 was no Terminator 1 or 2, but it was satisfactory! Return of the Jedi was the weakest of the series but that too was satisfactory. Star Wars Ep.1 was nothing like the originals but again at least it was satisfactory.<br />Revolutions is nothing like the above. It is more akin to the kind of sabotage that we see in movie remakes!<br />The filmmakers obviously have absolutely no idea what made the first film so good. Reloaded and Revolutions have gone down the road of Disney cartoons instead of staying on the patch of action comic book type appeal. It was a tremendously bad call by the filmmakers to focus too much on Zion and bring bit-part characters to the forefront of the movie. Morpheus is forgotten about and does little more than sit in a co-pilot seat next to Niobe throughout the movie. It was Morpheus who made the metaphysical statements cool. When the same things are spoken by some bit part characters... (who are given a leading roles!... oh what a crisis!... you simply DO NOT DO THAT.)... it just sounds plain stupid and dumb. NEW CHARACTERS are introduced that serve very little function and are forgotten about just as quick. The Trainman appears as an important character and then... disappears. His whole scene at the start of the movie with Neo served absolutely NO PURPOSE. The Architect materializes briefly at the end for a few lines to try and consolidate everything. Persephone is back again with the Merovingian as if nothing is wrong after her releasing the Keymaker in Reloaded. The Twins who disappeared in Reloaded are obviously vaporized, because they are not here.<br />The original Matrix was a high like no other. Reloaded was satisfactory and at least had some knockout action sequences with elements that where in the first Matrix and a few extra scenes here and there to help develop the story around Zion. Okay so the dance scene at the start was totally out of place but in Reloaded as soon as Neo met the Oracle it was the Matrix rocking like you mother from start to finish. Revolutions is NOTHING like Reloaded and it certainly is at the opposite end of the spectrum when compared to the original Matrix.<br />Questions that where created in Reloaded are left unanswered. What is it with the Indian family who take up almost fifteen minutes talking at the start of the film? The copout for replacing the Oracle with a new actress is explained in the worst possible way..... AND WHOEVER WROTE THE SCREENPLAY DIALOGUE SHOULD HAVE HIS PAYCHECK REVOKED! What a cliche driven script! You will not believe the stereotype dialogue on display here! Seriously it is a SIN to do what they have done to the Matrix series. Watch the climatic scene between Neo and Trinity which lasts for ages. Listen to what they are saying! Watch Neo stand for a few minutes in stupidity as Bane, who sounds, talks and moves just like Agent Smith, almost has to tell Neo who he is before the penny drops with our savior character! Bill and Ted where on the screen for a few moments there. Sssshesshhh.....<br />The filmmakers have stamped all over this film as if they are out to harm the entire series - or maybe - is it just possible ..... that the first Matrix movie was just made a FANTASTIC MOVIE by accident? Everything on display in Revolutions seems to point to that conclusion.<br />There are only two key action sequences in this film. One which revolves around warriors controlling \\"Aliens\\" type robots with guns and the machines crashing around the place with lots of gun-fire and explosions. It is excellent stuff for the first few minutes but far too much time is spent on it. We WANT to see NEO getting it on with Agent Smith!... and finally ... (and it is a long time coming) when it appears, it is nothing compared to the Alleyway Brawl we saw in Reloaded.<br />This film is a disaster. Even if it where like Reloaded it would have been an acceptable movie but it seems almost like some sort of Direct to Video type movie. The filmmakers should never have given our principle characters a back seat to other bit part actors. They should have reduced the Zion fight sequence by at least three-quarters of the running time and put that space into Neo and Smith getting it on in some way shape or form. The screenplay should have been revised from the start instead of plowing so much money into the Zion action sequence. It is very hard to describe what an utter disappointment this film was. It could possibly be one of worst mega-budget pictures ever made. Fans will feel downright conned. Those who are looking for popcorn fodder will probably find it okay-ish entertainment but if we wanted to watch okay-ish entertainment we would hope to find that somewhere else other than in one of the most expensive sci-fi films ever made. Thank God that the Lord of the Rings is there to redeem our faith in high-concept large budget fantasy films. Revolutions is a prime example of a marketing confidence trick marred with bad acting, bad writing and bad direction. The special effects are on top form but this DOES NOT MAKE A MOVIE.<br />Revolutions is a bad stain on the Matrix series - if not trilogies as a whole. Fans should voice their disapproval so that this sort of humiliation does not happen again.pent on it. We WANT to see NEO getting it on with Agent Smith!... and finally ...

B0000797IO|4.0|A movie of quiet desperation, of a good woman who makes bad choices.  She is a woman who gets a glint of hope, after she had forgotten what her dreams were, or how to dream at all.  Who wouldn't clutch at it?  I almost felt afraid during this movie because I saw so much of myself, and so much I don't want to become.  <br />For those who rated this movie poorly, perhaps Crossroads with Britney Spears is more on your intellectual level.
078401213X|5.0|The movie about the 216 digit number that can both unlock the secrets of the stock market as well as the Kaballah is a classic.  Max is a brillaint mathematican.  Perhaps a little too brilliant for his own good.  This man believes there is a pattern and he is bent on finding it.  <br />Not to mention his increasing drug problems.  Then the Kaballah come in.  They want a number to unlock theit text.  Max finds the number for *both* and finds that he is wanted by both.  And his life is at stake.  These people will stop at nothing to get the number.  Then he does something drastic to make sure no one ever knows...<br />This independant black and white film is masterfully done.  Well acted and well scripted.  You will get chills and thrills when watching this movie.  The commentary tracks are very informative as well.<br />See it today!!!  NOW!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Have been waiting for Whitney to record a holiday album for the better part of 15 years and finally she has.  My one wish is that she had done it earlier in her career when she was clearly on top of her game.  But what she delivers is a very warm and soulful holiday album - worthy of her legend.<br />The brightests spots on the album are the appearance of Bobbi Kristina &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; (so that's what Whitney sounded like as a child!); O Holy Night - she reaches for and hits the high note and the opening song &quot;The First Noel.&quot; - &quot;Joy To The World&quot; and &quot;Who Would Imagine A King&quot; were both Houston masterpieces when first released. (Wisely, &quot;Do You Hear What I Hear&quot; is not included)<br />The only mis-step is the title track.  Better to have stuck with classics than to add one original and decidedly uninspired track.<br />5 Stars - for giving the best she's got at the moment, taking some risks and for delivering what the faithful have been asking for.<br />Whitney on behalf of all of us who have begged for this album for years - thank you. Happy Holidays.
B00004YKSD|5.0|My son got me this for last christmas, I already had the vhs version, but this 2 disk set is even better. The interviews with everyone and learning alot more about the movie and everyone who participated in it, and what they really had to say about it, just blew my mind. <br />Still a GREAT movie, Great cast, VAL &amp; MEG awesome job!!! No one could of pulled off playing jim, not like you did! This movie is not only entertaining, the music is awesome, as well as the acting.<br />Any doors fan, will love this, true or not, the movie is awesome!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Don't listen to reviewers.  They always expect the same thing.  Sarah Maclachlan's new studio album is not Surfacing.  It does not have any songs like &quot;Building A Mystery&quot; or &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; but that's OK.  Also, the songs on Afterglow are not inspired by the death of her mother or the birth of her daughter.  The songs on Afterglow are beautiful.  Lifted by Machlachlan's heavenly voice.  I don't agree with the first single choice, &quot;Fallen&quot;.  While it is a beautiful song, it pales in comparison to the sentiment of &quot;Train Wreck&quot; or the frustration of &quot;Stupid&quot;.  The bottom line is, if you're a Sarah fan, and have been waiting to buy the album because of the reviews, just go buy it.  No fan of this wondrous and beautiful singer-songwriter will not be disappointed.
6304684754|5.0|I think this is a great movie and Val Kilmer did an AMAZING job, the way he was able to change himself through this movie from a younger jim, to an older one, was unreal. Meg Ryan also great in this. The music, acting, the story was very entertaining, this is certainly one of my favorite movies of all time.<br />Great Job Kilmer!
B000002LCX|4.0|My my, what a beautiful record. It starts off perfectly, with 'A Rush and a Push and the Land Is Hours' and pretty much continues this way for most of the record. The songs are strong, to-the-point, and what's this? Lush? Keyboards? Reverb? It cannot be!<br />My favourite band of the 1980's delivered a strong album as their unexpected swan song. Some even suggest that this is their best album. Uh, I would not go that far. Yes, it is far superior to the first album and Meat Is Murder...But The Queen Is Dead, to my ear, is still the perfect blend of the underground indie, pop sensibilities, and lightly-strummed guitar perfection. This album sees the best band of the 1980's head in a different direction, drawing from methods used in the past, coating it in a ghostly atmosphere and taking away all of the raw, punky edge that made earlier albums popular. I do not see this new direction as a negative thing. In fact, I very much enjoy the ambitious approach to both the songwriting and the production employed on this album.<br />Morrissey's lyrics are certainly a highlight on this record. Against a backdrop of jolty, bouncy, 'happy' music, listen to him croon about his girlfriend lying half-dead in a coma. Shake your head and laugh as he remembers being in so much pain that it would have made 'a shy, bald Buddhist reflect and plan a mass murder'. And Smile as he tells someone he's obviously not too pleased with that, if they should die, he might be slightly sad, but he wont cry (Unhappy Birthday). <br />But I advise you to skip 'Death at One's Elbow'. That's all. Otherwise, great. Farewell Smiths. You hit your peak with The Queen Is Dead, you came back just to let us know that you were still a more-than-capable band...and then you all grew old and refused to speak to one another again.<br />No chance of a reunion, then? This'll have to do.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD shocked me.  I cannot believe how good these songs are.  If you are looking for the corny pop beats of her last three albums, dont buy this album.  But if you are looking for a more mature sound, this is the album for you.  Standout tracks include the Moby-produced Early Mornin'.  These songs are moody, trance-y, and extremely danceable.  There is not one bad track on this album.  And why do the haters come on here and give one star?  If they hate Britney so much, then why do they buy every album she comes out with?
B000002LEU|4.0|It's interesting that an album comprised of leftovers, singles and b-sides has enough strong material on it for it to be considered almost as, if not as strong as the other two studio LPs released by this band (Unknown Pleasures, Closer).<br />If you are new to this band, this is an okay choice (although I would recommend Permanent first). If you are a Joy Division fan, have their other albums, or at least a few other albums, this is essential.<br />I didn't give this album 5 stars because it doesn't quite 'flow' and there are a few weaker songs. Glass, Digital and perhaps even No Love Lost are weak songs, admit it. You find yourself listening to a raw, punky version of Joy Division (then called Warsaw), with Ian's rough, higher vocals one minute...and then suddenly, you're hearing a deep, ghostly voice caught up in a mess of echoey, brooding Hannet production. <br />The problems I mentioned are minor, though. I just like things to flow together nicely. I enjoy early Joy Division, I enjoy their later works. I like it all, and a lot of it is here. Warsaw, the singles from 78/79, the singles from 1980, and some nice little leftovers from the Closer sessions. It's good.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Don't Listen To All The People Who Continue To Cut Down This New Album Of Hers. This Is Awesome Work! Me Against The Music Is One Of The Hottest Raciest Danciest Songs Ever! And All The Other Songs Are Enjoyable To Listen To Also. The Whole Album Is. There Is No Flaws On This One. Go Buy It!!
B000002KXV|5.0|The Nightfly is one of those incredible albums filled with songs that will stay in your mental vault of musical memories. Don't be surprised if after listening to this you catch yourself whistling some of the tunes (I.G.Y. What A Wonderful World...) Each track is catchy and smooth. The entire project flowed with such hook driven uplifiting melodies.Influences of pop-jazz, r&amp;b, club-lounge, etc. make for a timeless classic. The only other musical artist to come to mind with a somewhat similar approach would be Joe Jackson.
B00009L1TA|3.0|Basic is a good concept of a movie.  The 100 minutes you get are entertaining and suspenseful.  The cast is excellent- John Travolta, Samuel L Jackson, Connie Neilson, Giovanni Ribisi, and other very recognizable names make this an A list group of actors.  Plus, the execution of the storyline is superb and holds the interest of the viewer well.  <br />The storyline is rather simple.  On a routine training mission, a group of rangers encounter some problems and some of them get killed, including their leader, West (Jackson).  Travolta, a former ranger and current DEA agent, is brought in because it is assumed he will get more answers than Neilson.  There are two survivors of the incident, who of course, give completely differing versions of the events.  This film has been compared to the Kurasawa classic Rashomon because of the differing versions of the events not lining up but it seems more Usual Suspects to me.  We have just a couple of eyewitnesses who are telling us some truth and some lies when it will serve them well.  Just about all the soldiers present are blamed at some point in the story for the death of West.<br />Fine and good, but Basic is way too concerned with messing with your mind and twisting the story beyond comprehension.  Not long into the movie, what seemed relevent is no longer as important, and then another twist changes our previous perceptions, until finally, at the end, we are given the whole truth, that nothing we have seen really matters and that it was all a lie.<br />This would be ok, if the movie gave us some clues to figure out what was going on.  Movies I have loved recently, like Identity or the Sixth Sense had massive twist endings as well, but they played fair throughout the course of the film.  When you went through the movie a second time, you could see where the clues were given.  The twist in this film is so far out there, it is impossible, and I call that not good storytelling, rather not fair and uninteresting.  In that way,it also parallels the Usual Suspects, because that movie also was practically impossible to figure out, but the ending of that film was also more interesting.  The ending of Basic is difficult to even care about. <br />Honestly, the film was well made, not dull at all, and the characters were interesting.  But the movie tries too hard to lead us astray, and as a result, we are left out in left field, with no chance to care about anything that happens at the end.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Yes this is more adult but she's an adult now too. I love it! I've grown with her over the years. I love it and I'm glad she is growning as a singer and an aritist. Keep going Brit!
B000063DS1|5.0|If you are interested in this CD it would be incomplete without the Last Waltz DVD.  I am astounded by the cinemetogrophy of the film (directed by none other than Martin Scorcese).  What a wonderful blend of live and recorded scenes.  The guest list is astonishing.  The best of the best from the 70's accompany one of the greatest group of musicians from the era.  If you are a classic rock lover and absolutely need this CD, definitely get the DVD as well.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Excellent dance tracks. Well put together. Interesting collaborations.       Tracks 2 mention: Toxic, Breathe On Me, (I Got That) Boom Boom, and of course Me Against The Music
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is amazing, the chatter cut out, a sonic makeover, and the Spector stuff off, it feel more like a live studio album. You people writing negative reviews are just creeping me out. This is Let It Be reborn.
B000084T18|2.0|Massive aggressive hype obviously seems to fuel this album... almost as if the record is physically threatening you by the neck into hailing it as a \\"classic\\"... I bought this one out of curiosity and to hear firsthand what my students are listening to. (I'm an Art Teacher in a public school) <br />On a positive note, I do like the driving beats and the slick production... I'm sure this has been said many times before. The songs try very very hard to create tension and a serious sense of \\"drama\\". For this I must admit the album is entertaining and \\"listenable\\". I've heard worse in my day.<br />50's raps were a huge let down in my opinion... his diction (the sharpness of which you pronounce words quickly) is dull as a butter knife. His raps are monochromatic, lacking diversity and predictable. He is tough. He will splatter your brains. - it never gets much more sophisticated than this.  If not for the great production, his raps would honestly put me to sleep.<br />When I was a student we passed around dubbed tapes of \\"Eazy-E\\" in study hall... so I was curious when my students appeared to have a fixation with 50 Cent. This album \\"might\\" survive music history for all it's hype, but minus the big names supporting him, 50 Cent would be struggling to swim on his own. <br />I recommend ANY albums by Public Enemy or Gang Starr to young people in search of a good rap record.
B0000T6JH4|5.0|Any beatle lover will really enjoy this CD. Good pick up.
B0000CFW87|4.0|I am an &quot;elder&quot; Josh fan and first heard him at the Olympics. bought his first album (several for friends) have not heard such talent in all my years. I just purchased &quot; closer&quot; and was not as thrilled with it. still, he is the best young talent. wish he would do more T.V.  &quot; you raise me up is beautiful&quot; and the purchase is worth it just for that song.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears doesn't have to pretend she's a virgin anymore, and on her fourth record, she takes full advantage of that freedom. The most loveable and still the biggest former teen-pop superstar almost can't help making music that is at least in some small way delightful. Though you can't tell it from the lackluster first single, \\"Me Against the Music,\\" featuring her erstwhile makeout partner Madonna, In the Zone has its share of delights.<br />As Stripped was for Spears's fellow former Mouseketeer Christina Aguilera, this is a record of personal liberation. Spears has been in the news not only admitting to having sex, but also drinking, smoking, breaking up with Justin Timberlake and possibly hooking up with Fred Durst.<br />Appropriately, she has made a (literally) heavy-breathing record - the hard-candy, primary-color vocals of ...Baby One More Time and Oops!...I Did It Again are rarely heard on these tracks. But when they are - on the Newish Wave \\"Brave New Girl,\\" the album's most explicit declaration of independence - they're as zesty as ever. For the most part, however, Spears pants, moans and even raps over a smorgasbord of club beats, and there's absolutely no \\"oops\\" about what she's doing.<br />Furthermore, there's nothing ambiguous about what zone she's in: \\"I don't want to be a tease/Undo my zipper, please,\\" she sings on \\"Showdown,\\" one of the record's numerous lyrical references to her hips, her ass and her low-rise jeans. Spears is growing up, and if she's a little too abrupt about it in places - \\"We're going to the club to get crunk with Britney,\\" the opening line of \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom,\\" featuring the Ying Yang Twins, does not fall naturally on the ear - she does it with style and a lot of dirty giggling.<br />Two of the best tracks are the ones on which she takes the biggest musical risks. Listening to \\"Early Mornin',\\" an ode to 5 A.M. debauchery produced by electronica chrome-dome Moby, is like calling the Britney phone-sex line without a per-minute charge - a sensuous, swaying beat accentuated by a wash of strings that comes and goes like a slow inhalation. \\"Outrageous,\\" an R. Kelly club number, has a hot, odd compulsion and lyrics that are practically big-pimpin', Spears-style: \\"Take trips around the globe/Tints on the Jeeps so nobody knows/It's so hot got ya comin' out of your clothes.\\"<br />Stylistically, In the Zone recalls various stages of Madonna - there's a hint of \\"Oh, Father\\" on the better of the record's two ballads, \\"Shadow\\" (cowritten and produced by Avril Lavigne hitmakers the Matrix), and a little bit of Erotica's sweaty, layered funk throughout.<br />As a career move, though, it's closer to Janet Jackson's Control - a transition from pop poppet to adult woman, living large and in charge. Because Spears was the biggest teen dream, she was also the one most saddled with the imperative of repeating commercial successes by repeating their formula - an up-tempo pop-and-ballad one-two punch coupled with a safe, coy, generous, videogenic appeal that together made her a superstar, with 26 million sales of her first three albums.<br />Unlike her parent-friendly past work, this is neither safe nor coy. \\"Breathe on Me\\" starts with Spears declaring that she's halfway there, and concludes with her letting her lover know he doesn't even have to touch her, he can just (in a reference to Lauren Bacall's career-making line in the World War II romantic thriller To Have and Have Not) put his lips together and blow. Both \\"Touch of My Hand\\" and \\"Girls and Boys\\" are about masturbation.<br />Spears has her hand not only on herself, but also to some extent on the wheel - she has cowriting credits on nine of the record's 13 tracks, which is, to do some fancy math, nine more than she had on her debut (as well as eight more than on her sophomore effort, and four more than on her previous release). Even more telling, she's no longer working with producers like Sweden's Max Martin, the type known for leaving littlefor the artist to do other than lay down her vocals.<br />This I'm-coming-out record is an unhesitant move from songs of the heart to songs of the groin, for which \\"I'm a Slave 4 U,\\" the first single from her previous release, 2001's Britney, was a tentative test balloon. The girl who started her career looking up at you from her first album cover with a Crest-fresh smile and her knees together now has her legs open wide - and, on more than one occasion, something all her own between them. You can't get any more in control than that. No longer a girl, freed from slavery, now fully a woman, she makes a pretty convincing mistress.
B00009TB5G|5.0|As with the first Extended Edition, this DVD does NOT disappoint. It is truly a collectors dream. It is more than apparent that director Peter Jackson is a true fan and lover of the novels and wants to give the fans of both the movies and the books exactly what they want: perfection.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|With the release of &quot;Let It Be...Naked,&quot; I think it's finally clear that Apple has lost it. They have no idea what Beatles fans--let alone the general public--might want. To Apple, all Beatles releases are events, and all must therefore be marketed to the be-all and end-all.<br />Let's look at what &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; purports to be. The old &quot;Let It Be&quot; album is certainly one of the most controversial entities in the Beatles' catalogue. Recorded largely before &quot;Abbey Road&quot; but released afterwards, the sessions for what would become Let It Be were extraordinarily contentious, plagued by conflicting egos, drug use, apathy, and all sorts of negativity. The original plan--which was to film rehearsals for an eventual live concert--was largely scrapped; the live concert idea, originally posited as taking place before a huge audience in a famous location, ended up being given on the roof of Apple studios. <br />Yet music for the project *was* recorded, after all, so the band set out trying to make an album out of the mess. A few sample compilations of the album were created (and, indeed, were played on radio stations at the time), but barring the Get Back/Don't Let Me Down and Let It Be singles, nothing was used at that time. Eventually, however, the project was passed off to Phil Spector, who set about creating an album from the mess, but who also overdubbed something approximating his legendary &quot;wall of sound&quot; onto a few cuts. It is for this reason, ostensibly, that &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; exists.<br />&quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; purports to be the Let It Be album as the Beatles originally intended, stripped of its Phil Spector excess...and...uh, well, reordered, I suppose. Paul McCartney has been complaining for *years* about Spector's treatment of his &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; (and indeed cited that as &quot;sabotague&quot; in some of his earlier breaking-up-the-band lawsuits).<br />So is &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; the album that was originally intended? Probably not. The Beatles didn't *know* what they wanted, which is precisely why they kept farming the material out. &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is revisionism, which is hardly a bad thing, but it'd be nice to be up front about it.<br />But that's the thing: &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is barely revisionism at all, because it simply *isn't very different* from Let It Be. Spector's overindulgence was limited to exactly three tracks: I Me Mine, The Long and Winding Road, and Across the Universe. Sparse versions of the first two were made available on Anthology 3. Granted, the versions available here are different, but hardly to a revelatory extent. <br />The album has been reordered, with two of the slighter tracks (&quot;Maggie Mae&quot; and &quot;Dig It&quot;) being dumped in favor of &quot;Don't Let Me Down.&quot; Additionally, the between-song chatter that marked the original has been eliminated as well. And despite the kicking-him-when-he's-down denigration of Spector's treatment of the album (does anybody else think the timing of this, what with Spector's legal problems, is particularly unpleasant?), his template of the album is clearly still fresh, as &quot;I Me Mine&quot; retains its edit-for-length and &quot;Dig a Pony&quot; removes the same music.<br />What does this mean? Sure, it presents a few alternate takes, but &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; really doesn't sound all that different. It isn't revelatory in the slightest--thanks largely to Anthology 3--and its use of alternate takes for some tracks feels like a &quot;why bother?&quot; endeavor; they simply aren't changed enough to feel like anything new. Even worse, the &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;as nature intended&quot; implications are flat out false, as many of the new takes are glorified &quot;out-fakes&quot; created by editing together and creatively remixing takes (the title track is an excellent example, with parts of several versions composited into a whole). <br />The back of &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; mentions that the bonus CD (which, thankfully, doesn't seem to add to the cost) provides a &quot;unique insight into the recording of the album.&quot; This is untrue to a hilarious extent, unless quickly-edited snippets of dialogue and music appeal to you. Folks, this stuff has been bootlegged for *thirty years* now, something that Apple seems to be in denial about. Disc 2 could've been a sparkling version of the rooftop concert, or some of the better performances from the rehearsals; instead, it's a focusless, single-track mess that I doubt anybody will listen to more than once. <br />All of this could be forgiven, I guess, if &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; sounded stellar. It had the chance to, after all; it was remixed from the multitracks. Unfortunately, &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; just sounds *different*. The use of no-noise processing leaves several tracks feeling very artificial, with Ringo's drums sounding particularly anemic on several cuts. Not terrible, but certainly not what it could have been.<br />My verdict: &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is a cheap buy, but is hardly what could have been, and is almost definitely not &quot;naked&quot; or &quot;the album the Beatles intended.&quot; It feels at its core like an inconsequential throwaway, a quick lark of revisionism being marketed as a major artistic reclamation of a lost work...a lost work which, it should be noted, rarely ranks as a fan favorite. To hear Apple's marketing campaign, &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is unprecedented and revelatory, a great artistic statement worthy of a celebrity roundtable discussion (I mean...what's next? &quot;Beatles for Sale...Naked?&quot; With Leave My Kitten Alone instead of Mr. Moonlight and Honey Don't deleted because Ringo never liked it? With comments from Fiona Apple about how it's really her favorite album?). It isn't.<br />Is it worth buying? I guess. It's cheap (currently), and it provides an interesting alternative to an album that most Beatles fans are undoubtedly fairly familiar with. Just set your expectations accordingly, and try to ignore the fact that Apple decided that *this* was more relevant than a well-transferred, mono/stereo hybrid reissue program to replace those mediocre 1987 Beatles discs we've been stuck with for so long.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The Beatles' \\"Let It Be\\" Sessions are probably the most bootlegged of any era in Beatle History.  They are documentation of a marriage gone sour but with some beautiful music still left to write.  The songs on \\"Let it Be\\" are great.  The energy on \\"One after Nine 0 Nine\\" and \\"Get Back\\" to the eloquence of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" and \\"Let it Be\\" to the chills of \\"I Me Mine\\".  This album has no Ringo track (no big loss there).  Being an avid Beatle fan with virtually every bootleg recording and all the MFSLs and official releases, I was interested to hear what this album sounded like given that George, Ringo and Paul all had a hand in it.  It is different from Glyn Johns First and Second mixes and very different from Phil Spector's.  Being \\"Naked\\" it is stripped down and not what one might have hoped for as \\"fully produced\\" - rather it still sounds relatively unfinished, which in many ways is the charm of the \\"roughness\\" of the album.  Highlights:  The Long and Winding Road (new vocal track/no strings)  I Me Mine (Clearer George vocal/Outstanding backup \\"I I Me Me Mine\\")  Track Order works better  Cons:  [...]Lennon's vocals seem a bit drowned by McCartney's (surprise surprise sweet bird of paradox)  Still, a great album that sounds much crisper than any previous release.  In my opinion, the \\"Long and Winding Road\\" is worth the [...]for this little metal disc.
B0000CAQ27|2.0|P!nk's third disc finds pop's randiest siren expanding on the soundscapes she created after veering in a completely different direction with 2001's highly overrated MISSUNDAZTOOD. Being in the minority of not being a real fan of that album, my expectations for TRY THIS were not particularly high,  despite the quality of criminally underrated first single \\"Trouble\\". Ultimately, expectations were pretty much met--despite some bright spots, TRY THIS is not a particularly great listen.  Primary collaborator Tim Armstrong produced the majority of the disc, which wouldn't be so bad if so many of his tracks didn't sound so similar--besides \\"Trouble\\", the only other Armstrong-helmed tracks that distinguish themselves are \\"Tonight's The Night\\" and the excellent \\"Walk Away\\".  Linda Perry also turns up for three tracks, though none are as immediate as previous hit \\"Get The Party Started\\"(though she does contribute a rare P!nk slow jam winner in the Prince-inspired \\"Catch Me While I'm Sleeping\\").  The only other track worth mentioning is the rock/dance hybrid \\"God Is A DJ\\", which is the catchiest track on the album and, maybe tellingly, helmed by neither Armstrong nor Perry.  In the end, there's no denying P!nk's vocal abilities(at their peak here), and hardcore P!nk fans will devour this, but those who loved the hooks of \\"Get The Party Started\\" or even early hits like \\"Most Girls\\" may not be so forgiving.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Upon her return as an artist, Britney Spears now gives us a look into her womanhood and her strive for no longer wanting to be an image she was thought to be by many.  Her fourth studio album, &quot;In The Zone&quot;, brings together influences of reggae, trip-hop, techno, and rock while still keeping its ground in the pop area.  A c.d. equation equaling only one thing, success.  Many people have been caught up by the media blitz of her new &quot;Adult&quot; image, but what pop artist isnt doing that now?  <br />As for the album, Britney comes strong on her vocals on tracks like &quot;Breathe On Me&quot;, an enrapturing song that will have you hooked first listen through.  &quot;Shadow&quot;, one of the two ballads on the album.  And the haunting &quot;Everytime&quot;, a song taht deprives happiness and shows you what heartbreak is experienced with love.  Also the only dark track on the album.<br />Britney also comes strong on beats as well.  &quot;I Got That (BOOM BOOM), the next single, is one of the best tracks of the album.  It displays an edgier side we wouldnt expect from an album said to be &quot;trip-hop&quot; by the media.  Other songs like &quot;Outrageous&quot; and &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; show Britney can be creative and talented with her music as well as her image.<br />Overall, all elements on the album add up for success.  If you have no other Britney c.d., this would be a good one to start off with.  Every song will have you coming to understand Britneys contriversal, yet exstatic, side.  <br />Tracks:<BR>Me Against The Music (5/5)<BR>I Got That (BOOM BOOM) (5/5)<BR>Showdown (3.5/5)<BR>Breathe On Me (4.5/5)<BR>Early Mornin' (4/5)<BR>Toxic (4.5/5)<BR>Outrageous (5/5)<BR>Touch Of My Hand (4.5/5)<BR>The hook Up (4/5)<BR>Shadow (4.5/5)<BR>Brave New Girl (4/5)<BR>Everytime (5/5)<BR>Me Against The Music-Remix-(5/5)
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This is just another exuse to Spears to make money.  Have you ever heard her live?  Her voice actually singing?  Her vocals are really bad.  In fact, she dubs most of her concerts becuase no one would come other wise.  So This is raelly lame.  She's pretty, she could have been a model, or (as she shows) a talented stripper, she seems to enjoy it enough.  But aside from her, she voice on this CD isn' even real.
B00008UZPD|4.0|I was very impressed with this film, in short, a beautiful movie about what the human spirit is capable of with exceptional special effects, music and storyline. Posting it with a &quot;If you liked the Matrix&quot; ad is understandable, although when I watched this film, I thought nothing of the matrix. It had it's own unique story and not to mention fight scenes. That is something I am proud of the directors for doing, they did not try to mimic or copy the cinematography that was used in the matrix at all. That being said, I was very impressed with their own theatrics.<BR>So weather you liked the Matrix or not, give this movie a fair chance, I'm sure most of you will like it for what it is.
B0000CFW87|4.0|like most I own the first one and it is a great cd,<BR>and play it all the time, so I've been waiting like <BR>every one else and tho this is a good cd also, I do<BR>wish there were more english songs and that would make<BR>this a great cd. Im glad I waited tho, and didnt buy <BR>his live cd cos 'Broken vow ' is on this cd, which is a<BR>great song, this will sell a lot and his tour will sell<BR>out rightfully so, he will be around a long time, and <BR>there is not any one like him,he  has a great voice<BR>and also has a great team behind him with David foster<BR>who is the best at making hits and making the sound <BR>just right, I just hope I dont have to wait so long next time<BR>to get a new cd, but maybe that is why he has two good cd's<BR>because he did take his time,
B0000TB03W|5.0|I am so glad they released this DVD uncut!  I was not able to attend this particular show, and I am such a huge Shania fan, I don't like to miss a thing.  I was priveledged enough to get to see her perform three times this year, and she is the most gorgeous, talented woman in music! You can tell her music is all written straight from her heart. Her show is full of energy and enthusiasm, and her band is spectacular!! This was a GREAT dvd, and I enjoyed every little minute of it! Her new cd, UP, is her best one yet! If you don't have it yet, I suggest you give it a try. You won't be disappointed!!
B000089RVX|5.0|This is the only modern day band I listen to, and to say that means that this band is awesome. I would recomend this to anybody who wants to try new music.
B00005JM1F|1.0|I thought this movie was going to be funny, since I've heard it was better than Animal House.  Where are the funny scenes?  There were about 3 or 4 parts that were kind of funny, but that's about it.  To compare it to Animal House is a joke.  I can't count how many funny things happen in Animal House, Something About Mary, American Pie, Tommy Boy....because these movies are really funny.  Old School was just kind of dumb.  Maybe I just don't get Will Ferril.  He starts streaking about 5 minutes into the first party, and I guess it's supposed to be funny that no one follows him, but that's it.  He streaks thru the town and his wife sees him, but nothing funny happens.  I guess I just didn't get this movie.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD is fantastic!  A must buy for all Shania fans!  To all who were there in person, you are very lucky!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I've been waiting for this one since they announced it because I saw it as Paul's attempt to right what was a major wrong in his eyes for over thirty years. Suffice to say, I've already listened to it four times today and was very moved by the quality of the album - both from the new song sequencing as well as the VASTLY improved sound quality. If the Beatles had put this album out in 1970 it would never have gotten its reputation as an unworthy finale. So I'll give it five stars. <br />A few notes for those who are interested. Don't Let Me Down is from the rooftop concert, although it's been edited to eliminate Lennon's forgetting a verse. Let it Be sounds like the version from the movie as well. The Long and Winding Road is not the version from the original album, but in my opinion is superior, with better vocal and overall performance (although John's bass playing isn't appreciably better). The other cuts sound SO different and clear that I found myself wondering if they too were different takes. All in all, it shows that even when they were self destructing, these guys were still a great, great band.<br />I just hope that this is laying the foundation for the release of the movie on DVD. I've heard it was supposed to be put out this year, but so far no news.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Though she's supposedly been on \\"hiatus\\" for the better part of the last year, Britney Spears never really left the public conscience, thanks to her constant mugging for the papparazzi, barely there photo shoots, and melodramatic breakup  with/dumping by Justin Timberlake.  Now she's decided to trot out that little side hobby of hers--music--with her fourth release IN THE ZONE. First single \\"Me Against the Music\\" is a representative indicator of the rest of the album--staccato club beats produced to within an inch of their life and rightly so to mask the multitude of deficiencies in Spears' laughably bad vocals.  Madonna puts in a cameo for \\"...Music\\", obviously trying to recoup some of the spotlight she lost after dropping that little bomb(also known as AMERICAN LIFE)earlier in the  year--I'm not sure what's more funny, Madonna as Spears' musical \\"mentor\\" or the fact that she's totally NOT convincing in the role.  Despite this, the track is actually pretty good after several listens.  The same cannot be said for \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\", which ties her previous cover choices(\\"I Love Rock N Roll\\",etc.) as the most misguided stuff she's done yet--it's awful from the word go(there's actually a banjo in this one--I'm sorry, what?).  Luckily things get better as the album progresses, though you can't help but feel deja vu from some of the tracks(\\"Showdown\\", \\"Early Mornin'\\", \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" to name three that sound VERY similar).  She does manage to latch on to various musical genres here--the solid \\"Breathe On Me\\" is an electronic ditty that the likes of Madonna and Kylie turn out in their sleep, but with a little effort, Spears makes it work.  Even better are the bass heavy tracks \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Brave New Girl\\", which manage to bury Spears' voice among the background vocals and electronic bleeps but at least sound sincere when stacked up to her unconvincing come-ons in tracks like \\"Early Mornin'\\" and \\"Showdown\\".  And even more surprising are the two ballads tacked on at the end of the program--\\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\"--which are not only probably the two best tracks on the whole darn thing but seem to remind Spears--better late than never--that the whole thing is about SINGING in the first place.  In the end, Spears, just like her music, is still playing dress up--if she could retire that sexed-up image long enough to muster a little sincerity, she still might yet have an album's worth of strong material(like \\"Shadow\\" or \\"Brave New Girl\\") in her.at the end of the program--\\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\"--which are not only probably the two best tracks on the whole darn thing but seem to remind Spears--better late than never--that the whole thing is about SINGING in the first place.

B00009TB5G|5.0|BEST...DVD...EVER.<br />(at least until Return of the King next year)<BR>In terms of quality of extras and overall presentation/packaging, this is pretty much identical to last year's &quot;Fellowship&quot; extended DVD.  What gives the extended &quot;Towers&quot; DVD the slight edge is the video quality is noticably better/cleaner than the &quot;Fellowship&quot; was.  The sound is astonishing as well.  Probably due to advances in technology...I can't recommend this enough.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Okay, there are not many CDs out there that my 39 year old brother, my 32 year old sis-in-law and I (27 years old) can listen to in the car and all agree is a really really good CD.  My brother is the one of the family who is very much a 70's rock fan, and normally hates any type of music I play, but we all seriously agree that Jet is an excellent band with true talent... something that is indeed rare in this day and age after nearly emerging from an era filled with syrupy-sweet harmonizing boy bands! (I say &quot;nearly&quot; because they are not quite extinct yet... but I have faith that modern musical tastes will once again return to talent and originality, not trends)All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable music journey, evidently influenced by many legendary rock bands such as The Beatles, Aerosmith, Lynard Skynard, Rolling Stones and so many more... I really can't think of a better recipe for success for a modern band than to follow in the footsteps of &quot;the greats&quot; and then make it their own. I will definitely be looking for more CDs from these guys and hopefully will get a concert in sometime soon.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have been a fan of Britney Spears for a long time, but with this new album I have a new found respect for the pop phenomenon.  First of all, the entire album has depth instead of being a compilation of sugary pop songs with great dance beats (of course, this doesn't mean the majority of the songs don't have GREAT dance beats!).  Second, music lovers finally get to hear the range of Britney's voice -- just listen to \\"Everytime\\" and you should be sold!  As for substance, Britney has made the make-or-break transition from a teeny-pop starlet to a woman with real pop-music artistry. The album, borderline risqu and overtly sexual, still has appeal because none of the lyrics are lewd; you do not get the impression that Britney is \\"doing anything\\" with the heavy breathing (if you know what I mean); even \\"Touch of My Hand\\" is done tastefully. Britney fans and Britney haters alike should be able to find something about \\"In the Zone\\" that they like.  Forget about the feuds (Christina, Justin, etc.), the gimmicks (VMA Madonna kiss, etc.), the image ... after four years there should be no denying that Britney Spears is a wonderfully talented pop music artist - whether or not she is as vocally powerful as the other artists. I didn't mean to preach -- just buy this album you won't regret it!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|To anyone who is a &quot;fan&quot; of Groban....five stars is never enough to rate someone of this caliber.  The Lord has truly blessed this young man with a mature full-bodied voice that speaks to one personally from his heart to theirs!<br />He puts his entire personality and talent into every performance and he performs for his own pleasure....his love for the material used is evident... one is left with the feeling that even if he couldn't sing for the public he would still give his very best performance just for himself and the Lord.....<br />Lord, what a great gift this young man has been given!<BR>Don't hesitate to purchase this CD.....in fact, get an extra one that a special friend and they will never forget your thoughtfulness!
B0000TB050|5.0|Back in 1984, U2 recorded parts of their landmark 4th album, the Unforgettable Fire within Slane Castle's ballroom in Ireland. 19 years later, they've returned to give a grandiose concert, filled with rants(what would a U2 concert be without them anyway?), emotional singing and a beach ball.<br />One thing you'll notice about the concert is a more relaxed band. Viewing Boston's concert, you can see a bit of nervousness, as if they know they're being filmed and later releasing the show. With Slane Castle, they did film it but had no intentions of releasing it until a petition started. What seems a little pre-planned and tense in Boston is looser and relaxed here.<br />The other thing is the setlist. Boston has songs that weren't on Slane Castle's set: In a Little While, New York, Bad(aww), Stay, Gone, The Fly and I Will Follow(nooooo) while Slane Castle has ones that aren't in Boston's set: Pride, One(yes!), Angel of Harlem, Staring at the Sun(I prefer this version), All I Want Is You(amazing and a great segue into Where the Streets Have No Name), New Year's Day, Out of Control and the bonus track Mysterious Ways(does it matter that it rocks but it's not as dance-y as the original? of course not)<br />The only problem I have with the dvd is the Unforgettable Fire documentary. There must've been an affair with the song Pride cause that's practically what the entire thing is about. I don't have a problem with the song but what about the other classic Bad? Or a Sort of Homecoming? It's nice to see a making of but at least have ALL the songs, not just Pride.<br />All in all, excellent concert with one rather throwaway documentary
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Thank god Britney stopped working with Max Martin and the rest of the other producers she worked with in the past. Also, the Neptunes are old news. This album is a gigantic step forward from her last one. The club oriented songs are the best. Breathe on Me, Touch of my Hand, and Early Mornin' are going to sound great in clubs. Everytime and Shadow are great ballads because they don't take a true singer to sing them. They are simple melodies that Brit can sing with ease. Not crazy about the Ying-Yang twins song though. The banjo is a nice touch however. This is a definite must-buy.
B000002H6C|5.0|Before I listened to this album, I had assumed that every CD Metallica made before &quot;The Black Album&quot; was horrible.  Why did I think that?  Well, for starters, I had listened to &quot;The Thing that Should Not Be&quot;, and I assumed all their songs were like that.  I was reluctant, then, to try &quot;And Justice for All&quot;.  I believed that all the stuff Metallica had done before &quot;The Black Album&quot; was too heavy for my tastes.  You have to understand that I like songs like &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;, &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, etc. Yet, even so, when I finally got a chance to listen to this CD I was very impressed.<BR> <BR> The first song that I really got into was &quot;One&quot;.  To be short, I would say it is one of Metallica's best ever.  If anger could be turned into a song, this would be it.  Now, granted, I said before that I didn't care for really heavy metal songs, but to me this song wasn't because it actually had lyrics that meant something.  In other words, the singer didn't just have that &quot;rock growl&quot; to his voice the entire song.  Also, I would like to mention how impressive the guitar work was in that song.  Normally I get bored listening to music without lyrics, but not here!  Personally, I think that when Hetfield stops singing the song actually gets better, which I don't think has ever happened before in a Metallica song.<br />The CD would be awesome enough if it only contained &quot;One&quot;, but there are so many other good songs on this album as well.  The title track, &quot;And Justice for All&quot;, is amazing.  Even though it is over nine minutes in length, it never gets boring.  <br />&quot;Dyers Eve&quot; is amazing as well, and it probably is my second favorite song on the entire CD.  In that song, Hetfield sings about how parents restrict their children from becoming all they could be.  I took it that those lyrics reflected somewhat upon James own childhood, but because I don't know his life history that's only speculation.  <br />For some reason, I liked listening to &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;.  I think this has the best beginning of any song on the album, plus the song has a nice beat to it.  It's one of those songs that will get stuck in your head because of how catchy it is.  <br />&quot;To Live is to Die&quot; is another great one.  The fact that it doesn't contain lyrics (ok, very few) showcases Metallica's ability to create interesting and unique songs (for them).  In addition, it's another song that starts slow and builds up to it's climax towards the middle of the song.  Fantastic.<br />There were a couple songs I didn't like, however.  These included &quot;Frayed Ends of Sanity&quot; and &quot;The Shortest Straw&quot;.  The guitar work in &quot;The Shortest Straw&quot; was good, but the lyrics were so tedious that I got sick of hearing it after about the second time I listened to it.  &quot;Frayed Ends of Sanity&quot; was also very tedious and, ultimately, boring to listen to over a long period of time.<br />Overall, this CD proved to me that Metallica made some great music even before &quot;The Black Album&quot;.  In the period of time that I've had this CD (around 11 months), I can still listen to it every day and not be bored with it.  This is actually the first Metallica CD that I've been able to say that about, so maybe it is their best.  Personally, I like &quot;The Black Album&quot; the best overall, if for no other reason that it's the CD that got me interested in Metallica.  Nevertheless, I can understand why some people say this is their best CD, as it emphasizes the best of Metallica prior to 1991.
B0000C1733|4.0|This is a good, if not great, collection of the Peppers' radio hits.  However, check the songs out to make sure you want the audio only version, instead of the audio/DVD version.<br />Included on this set are the following: <br />Under the Bridge<BR>Give it Away<BR>Californication<BR>Scar Tissue<BR>Soul to Squeeze<BR>Otherside<BR>By the Way<BR>Parallel Universe<BR>Breaking the Girl<BR>My Friends<BR>Higher Ground<BR>Universally Speaking<BR>Road Trippin'<BR>Fortune Faded<BR>Save the Population<br />Like I said, it's a good collection.  But I like the radio hits and would have preferred the set include The Zephyr Song (which I think is on the DVD set).  <br />Still, a great collection of songs.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|This is an excellent album.  This gives the &quot;Let It Be&quot;/&quot;Get Back&quot; project so much new life and makes it a much more upbeat album than the somewhat somber original.  The new mix is incredibly crisp and clean.  The first disk blows original mix out of the water.  I cannot give the album 5 stars though.  This is due to the second &quot;Fly on the wall&quot; disk.  While for someone like me &quot;a diehard, know it all Beatle fan, the disk is very enjoyable, for most people it is not.  Even though I found it enjoyable, I would have much rather had a more song centered bonus disk.  The amount of material recorded over this project is almost immeasurable and there is much I would have liked to hear.  Most noticably of these tracks that should have been included is the full version of &quot;Dig It&quot;.  The abbreviated version on the original disk always left me wanting to hear the entire song.  Another way to go would have been to release a Remastered version of the original album as the second disk.  All of us who have the original would love a remastered version, and for those who don't, they would get the full story of the album.<BR>     Anyway the album is definetly top notch and all should listen, just wish something more meaninful would be released as the second disk.  <BR>     I'm also hoping this will be the first in a long line of Beatle re-issues (including the original &quot;Let it Be&quot;)  I've been looking forward to that for a long time though, hope the finally do it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|You will not find a better CD from Britney. I was in line at midnight this morning waiting to get the CD and it's been playing none stop since then. She actually sounds really good (yes, I know &quot;computers&quot;) and her songs are awesome. There is such a variety -- from slow to dance. I've also been a psycho fan lately watching everything on TV and she is starting to sound REAL. She is 21 years old...and she shows it! What's wrong with that? And for her being a role model to younger girls...she was a role model to US when WE were younger. We're all growing up right along with her. I give Britney mad props on this one...keep 'em coming!!
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from Britney and reading articles that talked about the songs on the CD really didn't help me at all.  But after seeing the CD on sale (a good one) and thinking, why not?, I got it, listened, and was amazed.  While her voice is not in the same range as Mariah or Christina, the songs are pretty good.<br />*out of a score of 5 = great*<BR> 01. ME AGAINST THE MUSIC feat Madonna = 4/5 = the lead single of the album, I'll be surprised if there is a person who hasn't seen the video featuring Madonna.  Good dance song. Basically about what it says (dancing/racing to the music)(cowritten by Britney)<BR> 02. (I GOT THAT) BOOM BOOM feat Ying Yang Twins = 4/5 = Southern hip-hop.  The pairing of Brit with Ying Yang Twins surprised me and left me wondering if she shouldn't have gone for someone who wouldn't leave people wondering about why she's going this way to establish hip hop cred.  But it works in a weird way.  1 point off for the confusion it left me (maybe she should've gone for Ludacris instead - after all, they both were Pepsi spokespeople at one point or another). On another note, I can picture this song being played in strip clubs everywhere.<BR> 03. SHOWDOWN = 3.5/5 = She doesn't sing as much as she whispers and coos on the track.  This is the song that has her asking \\"would you undo my zipper please?\\"  (cowritten by Britney) The beat's alright, the lyrics ok. <BR> 04. BREATHE ON ME = 5/5 = Definitely a great techno song.  I could picture Kylie doing this song, but it works great with Britney's vocals.  Love the beat.  It's one of those songs you'd listen to on a long night drive and just groove as well as a song you'd hear remixed for the dance floor (can't wait to hear how it's remixes).<BR> 05. EARLY MORNIN' = 5/5 = Moby does a great job with the music and the producing.  The lyrics are better than SHOWDOWN (in my humble opinion).  Definitely a chill song about the morning after all night clubbing.  So far, when Britney's writing withRedZone, the lyrics are pretty tight.  (cowritten by Britney)<BR> 06. TOXIC = 5/5 = Bloodshy & Avant produced better beats for this song than with SHOWDOWN.  Britney's vocals work with the beat. another great song to strip to.<BR> 07. OUTRAGEOUS = 4/5 = The R Kelly written/produced song.  It has elements that we all know and \\"love\\" about his songs - sex and the flute loop (ie THOIA THOING and SNAKE).  I know that R Kelly could've written something better (lyrically) for Britney.  But it's still good to listen to.<BR> 08. TOUCH OF MY HAND = 5/5 = Britney is not the first artist to write about self love, so why should she get any criticism about it?  Besides, the song is also about loving yourself (not in a sexual way) and goes about it in a different way than the way that Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson went.  Also, the music accompanying the lyrics?  Simply beautiful.  (cowritten by Britney) <BR> 09. THE HOOK UP = 3/5 = There's a dancehall/reggae flavor that RedZone tries to infuse with the song.  Just a song about hooking up with someone on the dance floor.  A fun dance song.  (cowritten by Britney)<BR> 10. SHADOW = 5/5 = a beautiful haunting song about the aftermath of a break up.  I think the break up with Justin was an inspiration for this song.  It's the only song cowritten by The Matrix that's on the album, which really disappointed me but hopefully the unreleased songs will be on subsequent CD singles (most likely import CD singles).  (cowritten by Britney)<BR> 11. BRAVE NEW GIRL = 4/5 = Britney raps on this one but I think it's safe to say that she's not going to make a whole rap album (Eminem must be thrilled).  The chorus is sung though.  In the bridge, her vocals are manipulated in a way that's reminiscent of Madonna's IMPRESSIVE INSTANT.  Neat beat, ok lyrics, definitely a song to dance to. (cowritten by Britney)<BR> 12. EVERYTIME = 4/5 = The ballad that everyone is talking about.  It's definitely a sad sad song that should not have been right after BRAVE NEW GIRL (definitely drop in mood).  I can picture this song being played at proms across the country. The placement would've fit better if SHADOW and BRAVE NEW GIRL were switched. (cowritten by Britney)<BR> 13. ME AGAINST THE MUSIC (Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix) feat Madonna = 3.5/5 = I like the remix, but again, the placement!!! Should've just place this in the middle of the album (perhaps after OUTRAGEOUS) and allowed EVERYTIME to fade to black.  Also, the extra time could've been given to any one of the unreleased songs she was working on.<br />For all of the 13 songs, this album comes up to a surprising 50 minutes.  <br />Personal thought (don't know if you'll agree with me) - perhaps Britney should stick with one main cowriter/producer for her next album.  It's worked for her on her first one (Max Martin, ...Baby One More Time), and it's also worked for many artists such as Madonna (ie w/ Patrick Leonard - Like A Prayer CD), Mariah Carey (ie w/ Walter Afanis-whatever his name is, see any of her CD's prior to Butterfly), Christina Aguilera (Scott Storch on Stripped), Pink (Linda Perry on Missundaztood), etc.  Then maybe her sales would go up.  Just saying that there's a correlation...or coincidence.<br />However, one criticism on the disc.  It's being touted as Britney's \\"most mature\\" to date.  Talking about sex and masturbation does not make one mature.  Breathing heavily on a song and moaning throughout the song does not make it mature.  While she does take a leap with the producers and writers she works with, the lyrical content is not really mature.  It's like a 13-year old trying to convince the world that she's mature because she knows what \\"masturbation\\" means.  If you really want to hear maturity on a disc. I'd recommend Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\" and Pink's \\"Missundaztood\\" - they both do not rely on heavy breathing or massive sexual lyrical content to display their maturity.<br />Also, I gave high points on songs because of the production, NOT the lyrics.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Anyone who likes or has even heard of Shania Twain should go out and get this DVD.  The whole DVD is loaded with great performances including her classics and newest single &quot;She's Not Just a Pretty Face.&quot;  She has great stage presence and the DVD really brings the concert and live performance into the home.
B00005JM0B|3.0|This movie overall had good action to it, and a plot that could have used some extra tweaking. The DVD does have some good extra features selection, actually a whole extra disk which could keep you entertained even after you've finished watching the movie. This movie, the third in the series of terminator movies comes in at number three on my list. The plot in the first movie well topped this movie's and the second well out did it when it came to the action+plot. We are sure to see more terminator movies, considering this movie left sequals wide open with the ending. All and all, good movie.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Where, oh where, could season two be? Oh, where, oh where could it be???<br />Easy money to be made for HBO - c'mon guys! Demand is there, believe me!

It's like watching a prizefighter stick-and-move, and pick apart an opponent, cutting them off, shutting them down. And you can see him grinning, knows he's got that other fella beat.<br />Also see :  &quot;DelightfuLEE&quot;, and &quot;The Gigolo&quot;.  F@@kin' RULES, I tell ya.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I have both of Josh's album and enjoy this album as much or more than his first.  I am a nurse and find his music uplifting and soothing after a stressful day.  The third song on the album with the &quot;violin duet&quot; by Joshua Bell &quot;Mi Mancherai&quot; (il postino)is my favorite...beautifully played with a richness of talent shared by two individuals graced by a gift few know, but many listen to and love.  This CD also contains a 20 min DVD about his photo shoot and a short interview in which Josh speaks honestly and plainly about his rising career in music.  Kudos, Josh.  Thanks for soothing out the wrinkles at the end of a crumpled work day.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This a great DVD. Shania puts on great concert. I will always have to see in live. She is just the best. If you do not have this DVD you need to get it. She has all of her best songs on it and some of the new ones. Enjoy.
B00009TB5G|5.0|love seeing Denethor before I get to see him in the third one. Faramir's extra footage is great, and love the comedic scenes in this film. it tops the special addition of The Fellowship Of The Ring.
B0000TB03W|5.0|shania is better then ever!! every time she comes close to my home town, or close to it i go as many times as i can. one of the best things about her shows is that it's not all glamourous with alot of costume changes, back up dancers, etc. it's just her and her band...more intimate. shania puts on the best concert, she interacts with her audience and man can she sing!<BR>not only does she sing new songs but she sings her &quot;older&quot; hits as well. i promise this is not one of those concerts that you watch once and that's all. whenever i clean i pop it in and enjoy. it's very energizing and gets you moving. and hey christmas is right around the corner ~ A PERFECT GIFT!!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|After giving &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; its first listen, I felt compelled to tip my cap to the Beatles.  The music, of course, still stands up some 30 years after the fact, but what amazes me most is their ability to turn a reissue of an album we all already own into an overnight bestseller. <br />&quot;Naked&quot; has it merits though, most notably a remastered sound that gives the rooftop songs a punch they lacked on the original and the studio tracks a warmth that was also MIA the first time around.  But for anyone who owns the original Let It Be, the subsequent bootlegs or the Anthologies, what is there to be really gained from &quot;Naked&quot;?<br />For one, the Spector-less tracks sound superb, particularly The Long and Winding Road and Across the Universe. The former, an alternate version which features a melodic solo by Billy Preston, is without question the album's standout track. Minus the strings, the song comes off as genuine and powerful, perhaps less schmaltzy than it sounded in 1970. The latter tune finally sounds like it's been done justice, with Lennon's fragile voice being supported only by a jangly guitar.<br />The rooftop tracks are a joy, as songs like I've Got A Feeling and Don't Let Me Down finally sound as exciting as a final Beatles 'concert' must have really been. Get Back also sounds stronger than the original, although cutting the 'I hope we passed the audition' comment robs the song of some its initial charm.<br />The bonus disk once again leaves fans wondering what could have been, as instead of being offered sought after versions of All Things Must Pass and other gems, fans are only given 10 or 20 second teases along with nearly indecipherable Beatle banter. We were promised &quot;the album the Beatles intended to make&quot;, but what happened to the other songs they worked on?<br />The surviving fabs got it right and wrong on this second go-round at Let It Be. The songs sound terrific, certainly more live and in your face than they did before, but the mixing is slick and sometimes too abrupt for what are supposed to be live tracks. Failing to finally release the songs that people have been clamoring for essentially missed the point of doing a much-publicized re-release though, proving once again that the Beatles just can't let it be.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|we all know that britney looks better than she can sing. i just wanted to support her because there are so few good looking singers out there nowadays. but i guess brit hired alot of people who knew their snuff. if you ever wanted to test out a britney cd, this is the one. it's not at all bubble gum pop, it's more like club music.
B000001DWG|4.0|First off, let it be known that this is a really great album. They probably recieved more attention in hindsight, than they did while together. &quot;Mother Love Bone&quot; was kind of a stepping stone of sorts. Members of &quot;Green River&quot; split to become &quot;MLB&quot; and &quot;Mudhoney&quot;, then &quot;MLB&quot; dissolved, and Jeff and Stone eventually became part of &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;. Outside of the Northwest, &quot;MLB&quot; were most known for being on the &quot;Singles&quot; soundtrack. The singer OD'd which brought the band to an end, but not before they made a huge mark. Songs like &quot;Bone China&quot;, &quot;Stargazer&quot;, and &quot;Man Of Golden Words&quot; are absolutely amazing. Of course the track &quot;Chloe Dancer/Crown Of Thorns&quot; alone makes this worth having. In the end, &quot;Mother Love Bone&quot; gave us one beautiful rocking album, and in a way, &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; and &quot;Temple Of The Dog&quot;.
0385504209|1.0|This book is one of the worst reads I can remember!  I truly don't understand the hoopla about this book.  Oh sure, it starts with an interesting premise, but the story execution is laughable. For example, the heroine has been estranged fro..her wonderful grandather for years for a mysterious, shocking reason.  Finally it is revealed - the secret ceremony where she witnessed, to her horror - what? A murder, animal sacrifice, cannibalism?  Ohno, much worse, her grandfather was having sex!!<br />Come on!  She calls herself French?  Not to mention the sreaming halt in the action every five pages so the hero can lecture us on Grail history.  Snooze... The characters are 2 dimensional at best, the coincidences in the story insult the intelligence... I could not finish this book. I can only conclude that some people are so naive that the whole idea of Jesus and Mary Magdalene getting it on is shocking enough to make this a \\"page turner\\".  Pitiful
B00005Q66T|4.0|This could have been as good as her first collection I believe, if it was in a different order, and had another couple tracks. No complaints with what's here, but I do miss &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, and &quot;Rain&quot;. Included is &quot;Deeper And Deeper&quot;, &quot;Take A Bow&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, and &quot;Music&quot;. If I could throw on one more, it would be &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot;, from her near perfect &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; cd. The two non-album tracks are nice to have also. After this disc, and the &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot;, if I kept a third one, it would be &quot;Something To Remember&quot;. That collection of mostly ballads includes &quot;I'll Remember&quot;, &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot;, and &quot;Rain&quot;. Besides the fact that it came out in 1995, it's kind of like &quot;GHV3&quot;.
B0000TB050|5.0|I flew from my home in nyc just to attend this once-in-a-life-time event, U2 returning to Slane Castle after 20 years. For this gig, they were not opening for another band, but it was their own show. And it was a big show. 80,000 people big to be exact. It was powerful and moving to be attending a U2 gig in their hometown with their \\"tribe.\\" It was a concert that got imprinted in my heart. So, I was in disbelief when I saw this DVD. I almost cried at the record store (no joke). After watching it again, the charisma, the enthusiasm, the love all come rushing back. Even if you didn't attend, you will most probably get chills down your spine. I've been to many U2 shows, but this one, certainly is one of the best. And of course, this show happend only 10 days before 9/11. The concert is still wonderful to watch, but  it also transposed me back to the blissful time right before the world changed drastically. In short, highly recommended.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|While Britney's voice is not amazing, her tracks are well produced and this makes up for any ability she lacks. I enjoyed this album because it has a little of everything from trance to pop to 80s electronica.<BR>&quot;I got that Boom boom&quot; rocks because the guest rappers with a twangy country guitar make for a cool and original mix.<BR>&quot;Breathe&quot; is another steller song. It is trance-like, Britney's voice sounds very seductive, and it is destined to be a club hit.<BR>&quot;Toxic&quot; is already stuck in my head after a day because of its catchy chorus.<BR>&quot;Everytime,&quot; the ballad of the cd, is a touching slow song with only a piano and a music box as background. Though it sounds cheesy, Britney's feelings really show through on this one.<BR>I am glad I bought this album and I enjoyed it more than any of Britney's previous albums. It is more mature and you can tell that every song has carefully planned with lots of different elements included, such as violins, banjos, computer altered voices and more.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD is the next best thing to seeing Shania live in concert.She performs the great songs from the &quot;UP&quot; CD. Including<BR>&quot;Gonna Get You Good&quot; and &quot;Forever and Ever Always&quot; This is a must have for any Shania Twain Fan....
B00005IC2H|4.0|Driving at night with CD on is like floating along the bottom of the ocean.  Dark watery keyboards, faint electronic pulses, a low deep bass, a voice that sounds like a cross between whalesong and a flute playing a single, sustained note.  The picture of the angel fetus is the perfect image to go with this music, especially for Svefn g englar.  This music is, sonically, a big gooey dark placenta to immerse yourself in for 80 minutes.  That doesn't really sound too good, on second thought.  But, still, this is a great album.<br />I only have one complaint.  Well, to give an example, let's pretend that instead of the short description that I produced above, I wrote the following: drinever la nuitwith sicd no slike poolfloat longclawtracking water . . . <br />And let's say I went on in that fashion - in a language that I invented, a combination of English, French, and my own imaginings that I call Winglish.  Wouldn't you tell me to shut up?  Wouldn't you just tell me that whatever I had to communicate could most likely be communicated with the same language that has been used to wonderful effect by so many writers and poets?<br />Now, I don't know Icelandic, so I'm happy to just regard this as essentially instrumental music.  But this invention of Hopelandic (the language that Sigur Ros sings in) bothers me.  It seems like an excuse to write nonsense.  Sigur Ros is clearly more concerned with the sonic side of music, but something about this invented dialect makes me feel like they're out to scam me by pretending that their moanings are communicating some sort of profound wisdom.<br />The music may very well do that alone: a few tracks here are truly beautiful.  But some of them seem unnecessarily bombastic - layer upon layer of strings, the standard prog waves of guitar distortion - that would be easier to criticize if they were singing in English.  That lovely high voice singing God knows what makes the music seem more original that it always is.<br />But I forgive all sins for the ten minute slow drown of Svefn g englar, and a few others: all I can say is Grueeeeeeeeerrriaaa.  Fletzlen bryutite.  (Glurg.)
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce Knowles probably had one of the most highly anticipated solo debuts after leading Destiny's Child for so long. Despite her adamant insistences that everyone in the group was equal, Beyonce was always portrayed as the lead singer and star of Destiny's Child which really isn't a surprise considering her father is the group's manager.  Beyonce blew up the airwaves in 2003 with her hit single \\"Crazy In Love\\" which got nonstop airplay. However, despite her smash hit, Beyonce hardly seems ready to stand on her own two feet on this album as she relies fairly often on guest stars. Beyonce has an undoubtedly powerful voice many of the songs do little to showcase it.    The album starts off with the aforementioned hit \\"Crazy In Love\\" which features Jay-Z. I didn't like this song at first but it quickly grew on me, partially because of the constant airplay and partially because it is a catchy, danceable song. In the long run however, it probably won't be seen as anything special. Following this is \\"Naughty Girl\\" which samples Donna Summer's \\"Love To Love You Baby\\". The vocals border on annoying in many places since Beyonce switches from singing normally to kind of high-pitched and breathy (hard to explain but you will understand when you hear it). This song sometimes sounds awesome and sometimes sounds whiny and irritating depending mainly on how often or how closely you're listening. Next comes \\"Baby Boy\\" which features flavour-of-the-month singer, Sean Paul. I honestly do not see the appeal of him considering he is extremely difficult to understand (and its not the accent, I just can't understand a word he says). The song supposedly was a big hit however I heard it maybe three times on TV/radio. Beyonce sounds very good in this song and her vocals work well with Sean's rap even though very few people know what he's actually saying.    \\"Hip Hop Star\\" follows which features Big Boi of Outkast and Sleepy Brown. The beat is good but the vocals are very bland and even therap adds little to the quality. The next song \\"Be With You\\" finally picks up the quality (though the first three tracks weren't terrible per se). This song finally showcases Beyonce's vocals however the lyrics are not all they could be. \\"Me, Myself and I\\" comes next which has the positive message of being your own best friend. The vocals are much better in this song and the positive message of self-reliance adds a lot to it. \\"Yes\\" follows and, like the previous track, has a good message. It talks about a guy getting too pushy and the first time Beyonce says no to him, he acts like she never gave him his way on anything. This is definitely one of the better songs on the album.    \\"Signs\\", a song about the signs of the zodiac, comes next and features Missy Elliot. This song is quite bland, even though I am very interested in the zodiac. The song is extremely repetitive, not helped at all by Missy shouting \\"Rewind!\\" in the middle and Beyonce starts the verse over. This song could have been breathtaking but instead it leaves a lot to be desired. \\"Speechless\\" follows and, though it drags on in some places, it is one of the better songs on the album as well. It is the first true ballad on the album and it is a very sensual, seductive song. Though it is somewhat repetitive, it seems more rhythmic than monotonous for the most part.  \\"That's How You Like It\\", the second song to feature Jay-Z, comes next and is possibly the weakest track on the album. While listening to the song, the only lyrics you can understand are \\"that's how you like it baby\\". The song is bland and not at all memorable.    Next comes the beautiful duet with Luther Vandross entitiled \\"The Closer I Get To You\\". This is one of the few songs that truly showcase Beyonce's vocal abilities. Lyrically, this is also a beautiful song and Beyonce and Luther's vocals complement each other quite well. The song sounds a little odd at first considering the lyrics and the ages of the singers however once you look pastthat it is a heartwarming song. Afterwards is \\"Dangerously In Love\\", a remake of the Destiny's Child song from their third album, \\"Survivor\\". This song is not very different from the original since Beyonce sang lead on both of them. However, it is still a beautiful song. \\"Beyonce Interlude\\" follows which is a short clip of Beyonce talking. \\"Gift From A Virgo\\" comes after and, while it could have been beautiful, seems to be lacking something that I can't quite put my finger on. Finally, there is the hidden track \\"Daddy\\". In this song, Beyonce basically sings a tribute to her father and all he's done for her. It is a surprisingly good track though a little cheesy considering Beyonce's father is her manager.    Overall Mark: 3.5/5    Truthfully, the album is more like 3.25/5 but I do not really want to get into quarter stars. If Beyonce's work with Destiny's Child is any evidence, she is an undeniably strong singer however she seemed to be trying to play to the trends instead of to her strengths. Instead of beautiful ballads, which she is definitely capable of, she gives the listeners average upbeat songs with far too many guest stars. It seems almost like Beyonce isn't entirely comfortable standing on her own two feet on this album. While she always seemed so confident on previous Destiny's Child albums, she seems a little more reserved in many places on her own debut. Instead of showcasing her stunning voice, Beyonce elects to sing what will make her popular. Beyonce doesn't seem to know where she wants to go with this album, or if she does, she couldn't quite convey it to the listeners the way she intended. This is a good album, but Beyonce can do much better.
B0000E1WNV|5.0|The wide disparity between the previous reviewers may be likely due to the fact they may not have actually seen this DVD.<br />It's stunning. Absolutely stunning. Here we have an entire Springsteen show (the first half aired live on MTV Europe) in front of a rabid Barcelona audience. There are things on this disc that you can show to people that aren't Springsteen fans that will make them convert. In a heartbeat.<br />Barcelona is known for being particularly Springsteen-philic. It shows. I doubt if  you will ever see a concert where the crowd is so enthusiastic and appreciative, yet considerate (they shut up when they're supposed to...) and knowledgeable. The &quot;Rising&quot; album hadn't been out all that long, yet they're singing along to most of the then-new tunes.<br />The picture is crisp and vivid, and the audio sounds terrific! My disc #2 had a little glitch where it wouldn't initially play, but it was momentary.<br />The performance itself goes without saying. It is obvious that the E Streeters are energized by the crowd. Reaction shots of the various members throughout the show tell the story. The first portion of the show was pretty standard &quot;Rising Tour&quot; stuff, but it seems that every time the band turns up their performance, the audience rises to the occasion. Seriously...the crowd even sang instrumental parts! They knew the lyrics to the new songs, and mind you, this is Spain we're talking about. English isn't even their mother tongue.<br />There's a two-song somber mini-set from &quot;The Rising&quot;, &quot;Empty Sky&quot; and &quot;You're  Missing&quot; that are simply haunting. The show then swells, a joyous &quot;Waitin' On A Sunny Day&quot; leading into &quot;The Promised Land&quot; and so on, until Bruce opens up &quot;She's The One&quot;. <BR>That song comes off absolutely ferocious...the band so tight you'll simply marvel. It's like they put their collective feet on some unseen accelerator pedal and took OFF.<br />Then Bruce turnsa relatively non-descript (for him) party tune, &quot;Mary's Place&quot;, into a barn-burner. It's a joy to watch...folding in several old Motown/Stax/soul songs into the mix. The Palau Sant Jordi literally lifts off.<br />After the MTV Broadcast ends, he does several &quot;requests&quot;...songs not necessarily done night after night. Watching him call out songs, seeing the band scramble to get the right guitar, etc., is part of the fun. It happens several times during the show.<br />Solo piano versions of &quot;Spirit In The Night&quot; and &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; are striking...it's hilarious when Bruce flubs a line during the latter tune.<br />The encore opens with a tour rarity, &quot;Night&quot; (another request), a rollicking &quot;Ramrod&quot;...heck, you can see the setlist for yourself. It's one highlight after another.<br />As he's bidding the audience farewell, after &quot;Land of Hope and Dreams&quot; (the standard second encore concert closer at the time), you can see him giving in to the crowd and calling out to the band for &quot;one more...&quot;Thunder Road&quot;.<br />The performers all seem to be having a great time...smiles are everywhere. Their interplay is something you rarely get on concert discs nowadays.<br />I honestly can't see the fault in this disc...I do not understand the negativity whatsoever! A 3-hour, reference quality complete concert DVD?<br />The add-on mini-documentary is fine, with brief tantalizing clips of tours gone by...but make sure you stay through the whole thing. <BR>The &quot;Night of the Living Boss&quot; clip, hidden at the end, is a hoot. Shot at Fenway Park, it uses the opening &quot;Take Me Out To The Ball Game&quot; and &quot;Diddy Wah Diddy&quot; to underscore some amazing footage. It'll bring a smile to your face, Bruce fan or not.<br />Now, it's time to start putting together the footage from the past. It's time for &quot;official&quot; bootlegs. There's GOTTA be footage from the &quot;Born In TheUSA&quot; tours, if not earlier. Let's start releasing those, huh? Please?
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album proves that Britney Spears has staying power. It is her best to date, and is very well put together. It's kind of refreshing to hear music like this coming from Britney Spears. I have always been a fan, but this cemented her in my book as a true artist, and performer. Work it Britney!!!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|NAKED is definitely a much better version of the \\"LET IT BE\\" (Lp/Cd) than the previously issued commercial & second version of the album. Though \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" has always held a very heartfelt soft spot in my heart and soul, and I do miss the orchestral strings, this original version kicks ass! My question, after all has been said and done so many years after and reputation/history of the album withstanding, HOW MUCH $$$ DID PHIL SPECTOR GET PAID $$$ to add strings and lengthen most of these tracks? I NEVER understood what was so \\"monumental\\" about Spector producing the Beatles...in fact, there were tons of landmark recordings being produced simultaneously outside his famed \\"Wall Of Sound\\" productions of the early Sixties that never recieved the hype his did. His productions are \\"another dimension\\" of the recorded music spectrum. LET IT BE - Naked would've been a huge hit as it is here and now, as it was before!

B0000DJZA5|1.0|I've been listening to the Beatles since 1964.  I THINK I have Most of their stuff.  It's probably impossible to have it all (even Paul McCartney is looking for a bootleg of John Lennon and him in L.A. circa 1974).  ANYWAY, Let It Be - NAKED is well ... disappointing.  If you already have a copy of Anthology 3 and or any of the GET BACK/LET IT BE bootlegs, don't bother.  It's the same stuff.  It was nice to hear a cleacn version of Don't Let Me Down (after all those years), but besides that .... It's a NAKED RIP OFF!!  I understand Sir McCartney had a lot to do with this re-make.  He's still upset that Phil Spector put strings over his sacred \\"Long and Winding Road.\\"  Well Paul, the devoted fans already had the pre-production mix and the rest of the people probably really don't care!

1857151399|4.0|Originally L'Etranger, the english version I read was (obviously) a translation from the original French language in which the book was conceived.<br />The story is in two parts. The first is of Meursault, the main character- establishing and developing his character. It traces his days up until the point where he commits a murder for no apparent reason. The second part describes his incarceration, reflections on what has transpired, and his trial.<br />It is written plainly enough to be taken as a simple story, which makes it somewhat enjoyable on a most basic level- though to take it as such ultimately defies the purpose of the novel. I wish my French was strong enough to have read the original. I hate translations as they destroy half of any author's story- the language he chooses for his tale.<br />**WARNING** SPOILERS POSTED BELOW **WARNING**<br />Historically, the book was partly written to defy the conventions of the time by utilizing the common daily language of the people (instead of the rigid formality that was enforced at the time). It was also written to identify, interpret, explain the ins and outs of Existentialist thought.<br />The basis of Existentialism, as I understand it, is that life is simply what it is, and no more. Concepts such as God, Heaven, Hell, the Soul, Eternity, Destiny, and so on, are but illusions that we feed upon to define some form of meaning for ourselves. Wake up, (says the Existentialist) your life is only your life. You are not pre-ordained to greatness. There is no Master Plan. You live and die, and in between you will make some choices that are of no ultimate consequence- nothing stops when you do; only you cease to exist. Our life, if I may, is just the flip-side of a coin. When no one is flipping anymore, the coin remains.<br />In The Outsider, Meursault essentially wakes up one day and realizes that his \\"life\\" is manmade, and really, dictated by society; that anything he does or has done will not and can not have any consequence. With this new liberation, he begins a fresh journey, unchained from the burden of the concept of \\"consequence\\". Though the story is told from a first-person perspective, it is conveyed in a flat, impersonal tone that would suggest even Meursault himself feels detached from the events that surround him.<br />When his Mother dies, Mersault is unaffected emotionally (though complains of the distance he must travel for the funeral and the inconvenience of having to miss work) and refuses to put on the show that society demands in such a situation. I believe that Camus had a clear point to prove in how the other characters responded to him. Though he is sincere in his responses, he is perceived by some to be alienating and suspicious, while others continue on playing their game/roles (i.e., his girlfriend Marie) despite his inability (or lack of wont) to play along with them- the former outcast him for not playing along, while the latter simply keep playing as though he were. This illustrates our lack of autonomy from the social body and, ironically, our immobility without it.

The first time I read it I thought it was garbage until I talked with my Philosophy professor about it and got some insight into the imagery of the text.<br />**WARNING** SPOILERS POSTED ABOVE **WARNING**
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I enjoyed most of the songs on this album.  There are two or three that I would classify as just okay (maybe really good depending on your particular taste).  Yeah, two or three songs were just so so....BUT NOT &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; &amp; &quot;Toxic&quot;!  The first one having Madona along with Britney on vocals is just AWESOME!......simply a 9.5 out of 10!  But the real break through song.....&quot;Toxic&quot;....is just OUT OF THIS WORLD! I say &quot;Against the Music&quot; is a Home Run, but &quot;Toxic&quot; is definitely a Grand Slam!....easily my favorite Britney song!  Now, I've been on my computer for last two hours, and I have to admit that I have been listening mostly to &quot;Toxic&quot;.  Man!...I'm still not tired of it!!!!  &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot;.....That was a T.V. show wasn't it?  BRITNEY...When you really want to....YOU ROCK!

B0000E1WKE|5.0|Run quickly to your nearest record store and purchase Whitney Houston's &quot;One Wish&quot; the holiday album. It is an amazing piece of work that is everything a holiday album should be. Ms. Houston is in top form vocally as she shines on all of the traditional holiday tunes. Personal favorites include &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;, &quot;Joy to the World&quot; backed by a gospel choir that will make you shout hallelujah. And &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; is proof that if daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, should choose to follow in the footsteps of her mother and grandmother, she will be a force to be reckoned with. &quot;One Wish&quot; is a must have for anyone who enjoys holiday music at its best. Congratulations and thank you to Whitney Houston for this accomplishment and for giving us this classic record to enjoy during the yuletide season.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I truely feeling that Whitney did a GREAT job!!!!! She really seem to have capture the true essence of XMAS. She take each song whether it's traditional or new and made it her own. When I close my eyes while listening I actually see her performing each song, her voice in tip top shape and she shows that she have a lot more control than before. Also, she plays with her voice more and seems to really enjoy each song she's sing. If you listen to this cd you should do just that LISTEN, and don't try to multiple tasking. You will not be disappointed. A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's fourth CD is probably her best to date. The press has been giving it poor reviews, but really it is a great pop album. Britney may not have the strongest singing voice, but that never stopped Madonna or Janet Jackson from making music, did it? This cd is full of sexy club-friendly songs and is jam packed with great producers and guests; Moby, Tricky, Guy Sigsworth, Madonna, just to name a few.<br />With this album Spears is trying to prove that yes, she is growing up and yes, she does still deserve a spot in the mainstream pop market. She achieves both with flying colors. Although a little TOO sexual for the 9 year olds at home, this album isn't about the tweens. It's about Britney being Britney. The songs are well produced and catchy as hell, and the slower songs have a great groove that would make Janet proud. Gone are the cheesy OOPS I DID IT AGAIN and DEAR DIARY inspired TEEN songs. In The Zone picks up where 'Britney' left off and takes it a step further into a more adult and mature pop album.<br />Stand-out tracks include the catchy \\"Toxic\\", the sexy Janet-esque \\"Touch of my Hand\\", and the chilling ballad \\"Everytime\\", rumoured to be a response to ex-beau Justin Timberlake's anthem \\"Cry Me A River\\".<br />Britney is criticized a lot, but at the end of the day she has what it takes to be a pop star. She may not be a Mariah, not a Whitney, maybe not even a Christina. But Britney is what Janet, Michael, and Madonna were and are: GREAT PERFORMERS WITH GREAT POP MUSIC. And that's all you need.
B000002JSN|5.0|This is one of Led Zeppelin's most talked about albums. One of the reasons for this is that it is a double-disc set where the second disc isn't laden with filler songs. This is Zeppelin's first disc where it has music of all types from acoustic to blues to hard rock. One theory for this is that half or more of the songs were songs that were rejected from other albums. I don't quite believe this, but you could make a strong case for either side. The first disc is by far the best. \\"Custard Pie\\" is not that good of a song even though Zeppelin kept to their tradition of starting out with a hard rock song; that keyboard that they use (I guess it's a clavicord) doesn't help either. \\"Houses of the Holy\\" is a good song, but why didn't they have it on the album Houses of the Holy? Yes, it could again be the fact that they used rejected songs from other albums, but I think that instead the album gave way for the idea of the song. \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" was the song that was released as a single even though it is not the best song. It did fairly well, I think it reached #36 in America. I did not like this song at first, but now I have realized that this a good song and this is the only song on the disc where the keyboard (clavicord) sounds good because it goes along with Jimmy Page's great guitar work and Robert Plant's vocals. \\"Kashmir\\" would probably be almost any other bands best song by far, except Zeppelin made a song called \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" It is still their second best song ever and is why I gave this album five stars, even though there were only a few other songs that I liked. \\"Kashmir\\" has great vocals by Robert Plant, great guitar work by Jimmy Page; John Paul Jones sounds good on both bass and synthesizer, John Bonham proves why everyone says that he was the greatest drummer ever; even the orchestra sounds perfect for the song. I can't say enough good things about that song. The second disc is only mediocre, but there are a couple of good songs there too such as\\"Ten Years Gone\\" and \\"In The Light\\". This should probably be third or fourth on your list of Zeppelin discs.
0446530891|1.0|I have been a big fan of most of David Baldacci's books and loved his first, Absolute Power. However, his newest book, Split Second, is one of the worst books I've read in quite awhile, and I feel so cheated by Baldacci that I'm uncertain if I'll take a chance on future books by him. While Split Second started off like it was going to be an enjoyable book, it deteriorated at warp-speed. The following lists just some of the problems with this stinker -- the plot is unbelievably far-fetched , the dialogue is so amateurish it seems like it was written by a child, the characters are not credible and cartoon-like in their development, the intended suspense is (for the most part) ho-hummish, and the ending -- oh, that ending -- is ridiculous!While I try to find point out good aspects in books that are not so good overall, I cannot do so for this book. The only mystery associated with Split Second for me was why I bothered to finish this very poorly written book.
0670824399|5.0|I think that Roal Dahl did an extremely excellent job on putting together this childrens book. I first read this book as a fifth grader in my middle school. I immediately fell in love with this book after I read it. I can say that I have read the book at least ten times, and each time it still gives me the same wonderful feeling I recieved as the first time I read it.<br /> Matilda was a very talented girl, whose parents did not realize it. At the young age of four, Matilda read all of the children's books that were in the library. Her very dysfunctional family could not understand why she always wanted to read and not want to watch television like them. When Matilda finally started schooL, one of her teachers, Ms. Honey, realized her wonderful ability and acknowledged it. Also when Matilda started school she had to dodge the school's most feared teacher Mrs. Trunchbull.<br /> She was known to throw children out of the window,or place them into what was call the \\"chokey\\". That was a room with sharp knifes and pins that could stick the children. Successfully Matilda dodged the horrible teacher each time. Her family did not accept the fact that she always read. Her father was very hard on her reading books,which Matilda loved to death.<BR><br />Matilda went on to spend as much time as she could with Ms. Honey. It seemed like Ms. Honey had been Matilda's real mother. She could never understand how she ended up with a family like that. Matilda's parents made Ms. Honey Matilda's baby-sitter. Both Ms. Honey and Matilda loved that idea, because both could enjoy the time together that they spend. Matilda's family decided that they wanted to move out of town. Matilda did not want to move with them, so she posed the question that Ms. Honey adopt her. Matilda's parents did not have a problem with that so they signed the papers and went on their merry little way.<br /> Dahl indeed out did himself on this one. This movie deserves five stars if anything for this book. It was puttogether in a well-written manner. I enjoyed every single second of the book and I could read that book almost everyday and get the same feeling.

B000001FTH|4.0|Island Life is a collection of Grace Jones' biggest hits on the Island records label. It draws from albums like Portfolio (1977), Fame (1978), Muse (1979), Warm Leatherette (1980), Nightclubbing (1981), Living My Life (1982) and Slave To The Rhythm (1985). The tracks are arranged chronologically so it maps out her musical development from the robotic disco sounds of La Vie En Rose through her new wave experiments with Private Life, her torch song phase in Libertango up to the funky R&B of My Jamaican Guy.<br />She wasn't taken seriously as a musician up until the release of Warm Leatherette in 1980, but I have always enjoyed her early disco work, especially the Portfolio album with its great tracks like Tomorrow, Send In The Clowns, I Need A Man and La Vie en Rose. The following two albums, Fame and Muse, were weaker but still contained a sprinkling of memorable disco musings like Autumn Leaves, Do Or Die and others.<br />Warm Leatherette really put her on the musical map, especially on account of her version of the title track that was an obscure synth-pop single by Daniel Miller's The Normal. She also did interesting versions of Private Life (The Pretenders) and Love Is The Drug (Roxy Music). Tracks 6 to 8 come from Jones' very successful Nightclubbing album. Libertango and Walking In the Rain are witty, accessible pop ballads while the funky Pull Up To The Bumper is controversially sensual. My Jamaican Guy from the innovative Living My Life album is jerky, funky and tribal with stunning vocal arrangements.<br />Unfortunately Island Life doesn't really succeed in providing the best of Grace Jones. It ought to properly have been a double disc as there are many other classics in her oeuvre that deserve to be on a best of album. Songs like Demolition Man, the title track from Nightclubbing, Rolling Stone, Art Groupie, Nipple To The Bottle and The Apple Stretching are equally worthy of inclusion on a greatest hits compilation. And then there are the great albums that followed her Island period: Bulletproof Heart and Inside Story, but that's another story!at followed her Island period: Bulletproof Heart and Inside Story, but that's another story!
B000002O1P|2.0|As a southerner in exile and someone who'd bought every Tom Petty album to that date, I was thrilled to pick up Southern Accents the week it was released. I enjoyed it, and liked Petty going in a new direction and trying a theme album after the previous album seemed a bit uneven. Most of the tracks didn't stand up to repeated listening, though, and some are just plain annoying.<br />\\"Rebels\\" remains a nicely done anthem, \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\" was a good break in the theme that brought back the original Heartbreakers sound (plus sitar of course), but I don't think it would have become quite so popular over the years if not for the contrast with the rest of the material here that is so weak, or if it hadn't been sold to us by a memorable video (yes, money is king). The title track remains deeply moving, and is the standout here. The rest of the songs are forgettable, and it's hard to believe that a typical Tom Petty fan would think this CD is one of his best. I suspect those who review it as such are largely not huge fans of his earlier or later music, but to each his or her own!
B0000E1WNV|1.0|The music industry never ceases to amaze me. All I read about is how illegal downloads are killing profits and that someday a total Armageddon will fall upon us and the business will no longer exist. Well if SONY treats its new products like this Bruce Springsteen DVD, then they deserve the gloom and doom. If you thought the flawed Essentials CD had issues, the Barcelona DVD makes bootlegs look professional. With strong material like a Bruce concert on the line, quality controls should be in place to insure a pristine product is delivered to the market place. Instead we get a disc that cannot be accessed! That is just inexcusable! SONY is doing for music what KFC does to chickens. The Bruce camp is not without blame here. Anything bearing his name and all projects that he delivers should be tested and corrected before production. This looks like a rush job to cash in on the shopping season and that is a mistake from an artist who fashions himself as the \\"everyman.\\" For someone nicknamed the BOSS he should address his employees to do a better job. As for the performance, there are better Rising shows but this one is good. The editors of this should cut down on the in-you-face close-ups. It's a Bruce show; we get it!
B000002O5L|4.0|Maybe this CD is worth re-evaluating 14 years after being a big hit. This is where a lot of Tom Petty fans started out, though it's hard for me to imagine having discovered him at this late stage in his career. Now that he's reached an even later phase, maybe it's possible to put this CD into perspective. I guess nobody under 40 can imagine Tom Petty having been considered a hard rocker - even if they listen to his older material, it may fit into the same &quot;pop&quot; category to them as this CD - but to me, the Amazon reviewer had the gist of it right. There was this great rock artist who hadn't made a solid record since &quot;Hard Promises&quot; in 1981, and was losing steam as his youth faded.<br />Then along came the Traveling Wilburys, and Petty got to join those even-older greats in recording some simple, fun, silly, throwaway music. The experience let him stop posturing as a rock star past his prime and to focus on just having fun, writing and singing songs with good musicians. I imagine the inspiration for the songs on this CD grew out of that experience. It has the same sound, and there are a lot of silly throwaway songs in addition to the hits that had some substance. At its best, there are fun summer songs like &quot;Running Down a Dream&quot; or anthems like &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot;. This CD is extraordinarily consistent good pop music, and seemed like perfection in 1989. Among the guilty pleasures are Tom Petty covering a Byrds song and the nod to Buddy Holly noted by one of the other reviewers.<br />After all this time, I rarely listen to this CD, though. For people who liked the hit songs here, the Wilburys, and Petty in general, &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; probably is an essential recording. Personally, I overplayed and got over the same-sounding Jeff Lynne-produced CD's that came out around this time: the two Traveling Wilburys CDs, the two Tom Petty CD's, George Harrison's &quot;Cloud 9&quot;, and Jeff Lynne's &quot;Armchair Theater&quot;. It's all very melodic, has no rough edges, and is technically perfect to a fault. Much of it is overproduced fluff, though. &quot;Free Fallin'&quot;, which gets a lot of praise here, is an overrated and overplayed video-and-radio-driven song that doesn't begin to stand up to the heartfelt lyrics of much of Petty's earlier and later work. I'd generally rather listen to less perfect Petty CD's that are less about hooks and more about feeling (&quot;Wildflowers&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot;), or to the earlier material that has more of an edge to it (&quot;Damn the Torpedoes&quot; or &quot;Hard Promises&quot;). For those who liked the hit songs but aren't Petty fans otherwise, the greatest hits compilations probably suffice. A great CD for its time; one star off for not aging any better than I have.It's all very melodic, has no rough edges, and is technically perfect to a fault.

B000008HZB|2.0|If you're an ELO or Jeff Lynne fan, you may love this. I admit I'm not one.<br />If, like me, you came here by way of having enjoyed the Traveling Wilburys and/or the Lynne-produced Petty or Harrison CD's that came out at the same time, you may be disappointed. The sound is similar, the songs are of course perfect in melody and production, and that same relaxed fun feel can be found here.<br />But I just didn't find these songs interesting. They're fun but they're fluff. Without the great singing or songwriting of a Dylan or Petty or Harrison or Orbison, the fun didn't survive a second or third listening for me, and I put this CD away in 1990.

B00005JMFO|5.0|\\"Love Actually\\" is just the right mix of romantic comedy and drama to leave you with that warm, fuzzy feeling as you leave the theatre.  It's an ideal Christmas movie for moms and dads who want to see something else while the kids venture into more PG films.<br />Writer/director Richard Curtis enlists a plethora of some of the finest British actors (and a few noteworthy Americans) to tell several different love stories.   While it seems that there may be a few too many characters at first, the overall flow of the film allows the viewer to keep track quite easily.    The cast is led by the ever-so-charming Hugh Grant as the British Prime Minister.  While some critics have called this casting unbelievable, Grant actually pulls it off by portraying a more human, but yet stronger PM that we would all love to have leading us.    His dance to the Pointer Sisters' \\"Jump for My Love\\" borders a bit on ridiculous, but it is nevertheless fun to watch.  In the film, the PM is caught between leading his country with a clear head, or giving in to his feelings of attraction to his tea server Natalie (played by musical actress Martine McCutcheon).   <br />And then there's Emma Thompson, who plays Karen, sister to Grant's PM and a long-married devoted mother.  She suspects that her husband Harry (Alan Rickman) may be cheating with a sexy co-worker.  Her performance, simply put, is a revelation.  The scene where she is in her bedroom is an example of phenominal acting.  Hollywood Foreign Press and Academy members: please take notice!<br />Another strong performance award goes to Bill Nighy, who provides most of the film's comic relief as aging rock star Billy Mack.  He puts out a cheesy Christmas record and then publicly bashes it.   But in classic Hollywood ending style, he does have an epiphany and realizes his wild musician life has been missing true affection.<br />Liam Neeson shines as widower Daniel who tries to help his young stepson win the heart of a popular school crush.  Equally sweet is Colin Firth as Jamie, a man recovering from a broken relationship in France who falls for his monolingual Portuguese maid.     You know what?  This film is such an abundance of great performances that I will run out of space discussing them all!  Everybody shines!  My only cast complaint is that Rowan Atkinson should have been given more screen time.<br />What I also love about \\"Love Actually\\" is that Curtis doesn't, if you'll pardon the pun, wrap up each story in a happy little Christmas package.  There are a few sad, realistic moments, particularly in the Karen/Harry subplot and in Laura Linney's turn as Sarah, an assistant who has waited so long to be with the man she loves.  She realizes, in some of the film's key dramatic instances, that family matters are getting in the way.<br />All in all, Curtis has struck gold again, in tradition of movies like \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" and \\"Bridget Jones' Diary.\\"  Yeah, some of the love stories may be a little far-fetched, but aren't they all in fantasy movie world?  What matters is that they are sweet and not without their share of obstacles.  This film is a nice departure from some of the more disturbing violent films as of late.   But be warned: it is a little more adult than most other comedies in theatres. The innuendos, language, and nudity earn the R-rating.  So see it without the young kids, but do enjoy.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Once again, this CD didn't INSTANTLY get me, but I think that is because I heard it for the first time in my car's bad music system and the bass is permanently too high and it made the songs sound pretty bad.  However, once I got home and listened to it on headphones (which I believe is important to truely get every stum and hum of a song) I liked (almost) every song when I heard it.  It definitely has more R&amp;B and GREAT little &quot;noises.&quot;  The little &quot;noises&quot; (which are sounds I have no idea where they came from) greatly enhance the beats of these songs.  The only song I don't like is &quot;Outrageous&quot; simply because I think the repeating of &quot;outrageous&quot; brings this CD down to kind of past cheesey pop... which it is most definitely NOT  However, that song may grow on me.<br />I am a HUGE fan of Britney and I believe she gets better with each CD.  To my joy, this is her FIRST CD that I pretty much liked every song the first or second time I heard it.  I didn't just force myself to get used to (and then subconsciously pretend to like) the songs because I payed for the CD.  I do actually enjoy them.  Plus, there are some AMAZING &quot;naughty time&quot; songs on this CD :)<br /> - John
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Anyone who's read my other reviews on this site knows that I am a hardcore Mushroomhead fan. There is only one band that I love more than Cleveland's masked militia, and that's Avenged Sevenfold. A7X delivers some of the most intense and beautiful hard rock that is capable of the human body. M. Shadows, their singer, has not 1, not 2, but 3 SEPERATE VOICES!!!!! He can sing beautifully, he can scream with enormous talent, and he can do a John Bush/James Hetfield style melodic growl. His range is also incredible. He can hit the lowest lows and belt out insane highs. The singing is only the beginning however. Their drummer, The Reverend Tholomew Plague, must have eight arms. He plays insanely fast and never lets up. Their guitarists, Zacky Vengeance and Synyster Gates, play what is without a doubt the best guitar in modern rock. Kirk Hammett has nothing on these guys, who were only 18 when their first record, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet,  was recorded, kinda like Metallica. Their solos (yes, solos on a modern record) are homages to Pantera and Iron Maiden. In fact, Avenged Sevenfold is a band that plays classic metal with a punk and death metal twist. No Numetal here, at all. Some people call them emo metal, but that's far from the truth. Their softest song, &quot;I Won't See You Tonight, Part 1.&quot; is more of a classic metal slow song, like Pantera's &quot;Suicide Note, Part 2.&quot;   Another great thing about A7X is their lyrics. They speak of foul relationships and evil deeds without sounding like whiney emo boys. That's a talent that most modern punk and metal bands could certainly use but lack entirely. I hate to compare amazing bands to other bands, but if I had to, I'd say that A7X is a mix of In Flames, Pantera, and AFI, with twice the talent of all three bands. I don't want Avenged Sevenfold's music to get ruined by success like our friends Linkin Park, and I certainly don't want people calling them &quot;sellouts&quot;, but I hope they do grow to becomelegends, because this album is nothing short of perfect.

B0000CBHOI|3.0|The premise is a good one: take seven visionary directors and turn them loose on a subject like the blues. The result, while for the most part excellent has a slight tendency to lag a little. <br />The Blues takes us on a musical journey through perhaps the only true American art form. The journey begins in the Mississippi delta and winds its way to Mali and all points in between. What we wind up with is a history of the black influence in American and its expansion to the world.<br />The series opens with Martin Scorsese's Feel Like Goin' Home a documentary that takes modern blues player Cory Harris from the Misissipii delta to Mali in Africa to explore the similarities in the music that moved from Africa with the slave transports to the Southern United States.<br />German director Wim Wenders film The Soul of a Man chronicles the lives of three blues players that affected the director. Through fictional recreation and archival footage we get biographies of Blind Willie Johnson, Skip James, and J.B. Lenoir.<br />Richard Pearce takes us on a musical journey with B.B King. and Rosco Gordon back to Memphis and Beale Street og the past and present in his Road to Memphis. Also explored is the story of moden player Bobby Rush who continues to travel the &quot;chitlin circuit&quot; of his ancestors. The film culminates in a performance of bles legends at the W.C. Handy Awards.<br />Charles Burnett tells the story of his youthful travels with his southern blues loving uncle in Warming By the Devil's Fire. This film relies heavily on archival footage of the great southern blues artists and explains the differences  between the music that was played on Saturday nights in contrast with the gospel music of Sunday mornings. It is interesting to note that in many respects that there was not a whole lot of difference between the two genres in style.<br />Perhaps the most interesting film is Marc Levin's Godfathers and Sons which explores the Chicago blues scene. The film profilesMarshall Chess, son of Leonard Chess and founder of the legendary Chess Records. Chess meets with rap icon Chuck D to take the blues to its next level with a modern recording of Electric Mud. The reunion of the origal band with blues next generation makes for an interesting film.<br />Red, White and Blues by director Mike Figgis explains the blues impact on classic rock in the 60's and 70's. This is a straight interview piece that covers the British invasion by the music and its branching out to the world.<br />Piano Blues is Clint Eastwood's contribution to the series. This film features interviews with piano masters Ray Charles, Dr. John and Dave Brubeck. This piece also includes archival footage of Art Tatum, Theolonious Monk, Fats Domino, and Professor Longhair.<br />The series is a good one if not necessary one that you'll want to watch over and over. The main problem is that there too little emphasis on the actual recordings. The films stress the music but I would have enjoyed hearing more.
B00008977N|3.0|It's a shame that more effort was not put into the video portion of this DVD.  The audio is outstanding, one of the best I've heard, but by the same token the video is the worst.  I have a 50 inch Sony rear projection HDTV which is capable of true 1080 line resolution.  My television is not the problem. Other DVD's like Bruce Springsteen live in NJ look great, this is clearly a bad video.  The reviewers who claim that it is not bad, clearly don't know what a good video should look like.  On the other hand, if you like Peter Gabriel, you'll forgive the video quality because the audio is outstanding.  This could have been a really great DVD if they given the video more attention.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Run!!! Get the Chicago concert dvd.  Shania put on a phenomenal show and we get to relive it over and over.  With the addition on non televised songs this dvd is an awesome gift for any Shania fan.
B0000TB03W|5.0|None stop entertainment from start to finish! Scenes of fans will have you eager to get concert tickets to go to a show and see first hand all the fun. Some of the best moments are on stage with shania and the fabulous falls. Extremely Entertaining!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Yes, the songs sound better than in the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; release, but Apple Corps is cheating us in not adding the substantial number of alternate takes available.  With some editing a credible Beatles performance of &quot;All things must pass&quot; could have been added.  Imagine that!  &quot;Get Back&quot;, &quot;Let it Be&quot; , &quot;Two of Us&quot; and &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; were rehearsed and performed ad nauseum by the band in these sessions, so great alternate takes were available to be included, instead of the useless &quot;teaser&quot; bonus CD.  To hear George work on his &quot;Let it Be&quot; solo over several takes is amazing and Ringo's playing was never better than at these sessions.  I guess I am sticking with my &quot;Thirty Days&quot; bootleg with its great 20+ takes each on &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;Let it Be&quot;.  It is uncompressed and not sped up like this release.  The least they could have done is include the complete &quot;Rooftop Concert&quot; on the bonus cd.  Maybe this will be corrected with the DVD release but don't hold your breath.<BR>In short, a wasted opportunity for another great historical archive release.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I didn't have the pleasure of attending the Chicago concert but i got to see it on tv and now am a proud owner of the dvd. From the moment the dvd starts you will be in heaven. Shania is definitely the most amazing performer today. There are 22 mesmerizing songs in all. With fantastic upclose footage of Shania and the wonderful Fabulous Falls band that backs her up. Lots of shots of the audience who are obviously loving every single second will leave you wishing you could have been there. I will positively be buying another copy for this one will soon wear out with all the playing of it over and over and over again i'll be doing.
0375713751|3.0|When I first started reading this book, I almost put it back down-- just reading about Kate's life was stressing me out!  But I am glad I continued.  While there were things in the writing that bothered me, such as the constant 'moments of lucidity' when Kate preaches to us about the paradoxes a working mother must face, the fact that this book addresses these paradoxes makes it worth a read.<br />Yes, Kate has a full-time nanny and a great job and salary and plenty of other things, but these don't make up for how she feels about missing out on her children's lives.  She really is trying to please everyone and to have it all, and does love her career for so much more than the money.  But she is faced with trade-offs which, she often reminds us, her male counterparts never really have to address.  So those who think she's got the perfect life and is merely whining may have missed the point.  <br />Granted there are many mothers who *must* work full-time, and Kate could option out of it, and that may make her seem whiny or self-indulgent.  But I think she has a point when she mulls over her own daughter's future.  Should she keep up with the Joneses and make sure her daughter gets into the best schools, moving on to University, only to eventually be stuck with one of two choices: joining the Muffia, or becoming a working mother pulled in too many directions?  Eventually the book alludes to other options, but only after Kate has pushed herself beyond her limits.  <br />I think this would be a great book for discussion among any group of mothers, whether full-time career moms or full-time at home, or anywhere in-between.
B0000TB03W|5.0|What are you waiting for?! I must say never has there been a more charismatic performer. Shania twain will have you on your feet singing and dancing along. From the first song to the last all 22 of them. You'll really see and feel the passion that shania has with every song see sings.
B0000CBY24|5.0|This is an absolutely inspiring film. It touched my heart and brought tears to my eyes. In a time when so many children take everything for granted, it was good to see a film about a young girl who believed in herself and her future (fate) even when the most important man in her life did not share her beliefs and openly discouraged her activities.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney has done it this time. I have only had the cd for 2-3 hours and I love it! Britney's song, 'Everytime' really hit me hard. Ofcourse I am a sucker for pathetic love songs. If this was aimed for Justin, waitago! This cd will make any person cd the feeling going and make them extremelly happy. Go out and buy it people!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is seriously Britney's best work.  Don't let her last album fool you... this new CD shows brit's full potential and will shock a lot of non britney fans everywhere.... Come one people GET IN THE ZONE with Britney
B0000AUHPK|3.0|I love the 1939 Oliver film but it and all of the other versions of this film never go beyond the first half of the novel and then the very ending, and even then Olivier's version is far happier than the book and the TImothy Dalton version completly changes the entire novel!<BR>While this film couldn't possibly contain all of the novel it does a very good job of it and unlike a previous reviewer I did not find it choppy. The filmakers took the best elements of both generations of this tale and managed, for the first time, to do the entire novel some justice. I would still like to see someone do a minisieres of the entire book someday, it would be worth it.
B00008LDPU|3.0|I would describe my opinion of &quot;The Animatrix&quot; as luke warm. This is a collection of short storys that show alot of the things that the 3 movies did not. The first short story had the best animation and was intended to be seen between &quot;The Matrix&quot; or &quot;The Matrix:Reloaded&quot;. The rest of the movies, short storys, explain how things work in &quot;The Matrix&quot; world and some of the past as it involves &quot;The Matrix&quot; story line. All the storys were animated &amp; directed by different people, so the end product differs from one story to the next. I would'nt put this film in the same catagory with the 3 &quot;Matrix&quot; films, but its worth seeing if you are a real &quot;Matrix&quot; fan.
630025111X|5.0|This is one of the most underated westerns ever made and it never seems to get the attention and respect it deserves.  Whenever I see most of the &quot;must see&quot; lists, this movie rarely gets any mention and yet when I saw it, I immediately ranked it among my all time favorites.  This movie will move you and stay in your memory as will the theme song. This is my first review ever on Amazon and I felt it needed to be done to give this truly great movie some much deserved attention.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is hands down the best Britney album ever! Her vocals have greatly approved and her style has gone pass pop and is venturing into new territory. The best song on the album(in my opinion) is Breathe On Me. I didn't think she could get any sexier than I'm a slave 4 U(one of my favorites) but she does it with Breathe On Me. I recommend this album to all Britney fans and haters...this is a new Britney that everyone should get to know!!!!
B000002KD9|5.0|....nowadays this minute and a half track would be called an interlude on many of the bloated, half-baked discs released with staggering regularity. But on this 1970 classic it's just one of many great tracks that make up Neil Young's 3rd solo LP. While it's really hard for me to quibble with anything Young released during his most fruitful period, something about this particular album stands out. He wasn't trying to prove his clout as a hitmaker anymore, he'd already fully incorporated Crazy Horse into his sound and his songwriting had grown by leaps and bounds, this was simply Young relaxing and recording what felt good to him at the time. At least that's the impression I get listening to this set of relaxed yet confident tracks. &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; is a ragged waltz of such beauty that it seems much longer than it's 3 minute running time. The hard-rocking &quot;Southern Man&quot; incited much controversy 33 years ago, but it's lyrics seem quaint now in the 21st century, and musically speaking, it rocks like a b***h! The piano and voice combo on the quietly yearning title track is another current fave of mine. Everything here works very well and marks yet another great addition to one of the finest catalogs in all of popular music. Indespensible.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I bought this CD yesterday and it was AMAZINGLY GOOD! Every single song was a hit. The songs flowed together nicey.

B0000CAQ26|4.0|This CD is good, but very very different.  If you are expecting to buy it and hear lots of tracks like &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot; and &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot;, you're going to be disappointed.  These songs are straight up punk/rock.  One song (&quot;Catch Me While I'm Sleeping&quot;) is a slow song, and it's more of like a '70s R&amp;B song rather than rock.  Most all of the songs are very good, but a couple (&quot;Hooker&quot;-hidden track, &quot;Waiting for Love&quot; and &quot;Humble Neighborhoods&quot;) are a little....weird...you have to hear them to know what I mean.  lol...I am a hardcore Pink fan, and the album is very good.  The lyrics are clever, the melodies are fun, the songs are fast-paced and edgy.  But VERY VERY different from anything that she has ever done in the past.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Absolutely fantastic DVD. Just pure joy. From the very first second to the end.
B00009V7RF|5.0|This CD is really really good.  The beats are fun, the lyrics are great, and the current addition of the female frontwoman from Wild Orchid was pure genius.  She fits like a puzzle piece.  Bottom Line:  This CD is great.  Plain and simple.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Okay, Dream Theater is capable of better than this. I almost wish they would nix the side projects and concentrate all their efforts on one big, hulking mega-project similar to &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot;. They are definitely capable of recording one of the most brilliant CD's of all time, so why does &quot;Train of Thought&quot; leave people dissatisfied?<BR>     For me, it seems to go by too fast. That's both good and bad. It seems too short; incomplete, even at 70 minutes. Seven songs is not enough. Maybe it has to do with a relative lack of variety. And &quot;Vacant&quot; doesn't really qualify as a DT song, it's more of a prelude to &quot;Stream of Consciousness.&quot;<BR>     I agree with all the listeners who are radically polarized. John Petrucci's guitar solos are blisteringly fast, leaving skid marks on the ears. Ditto for Ruddess's keyboard acrobatics. I think people want some slower, more emotional soloing that builds in momentum to a crushing impact. There's not much subtlety or range here. I agree that some of the lyrics are banal. On the other hand, some of the lyrics are brilliant. As for &quot;Glass Prison 2&quot;, I like some of the vocal distortions, but I don't need them in excess. Hearing James LaBrie screaming into an audio filter doesn't really do much for me.<BR>     As for the positives, all the songs are melodic, pulverizing, and energetic. I missed some of the extended instrumental interplay of the past two albums. I also missed some of DT's underrated ballads. A little more thought and emotion would make this more memorable. As for anger and being edgy or controversial, Dream Theater is simply too intelligent and sophisticated a band to emulate some of the bands that are obviously emulating them.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Wow. I had my doubts about Ms. Spears new album, as I don't even consider myself a fan. The only songs of hers I've liked in her career are 'Slave', 'Boys', and the new track with Madonna. And to put it lightly, I was pleasantly suprised with &quot;In the Zone&quot;. This is Britney in a whole new light, one we have never seen before. Each song has its own unique style and sound. Genres/sounds ranging from dancehall, techno, rock-pop, hip-hop, trip-hop, and good ol new age pop dominate this ecelctic album, along with two outstanding ballads. My favorites, although hard to name since I love all the tracks, have to be &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot;, &quot;Early Mornin'&quot;, &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Shadow&quot;, &quot;Showdown&quot;, and &quot;Breathe On Me&quot;. Not one track on this album is a filler.
0385504209|2.0|I hadn't heard all this stuff about Mary Magdalene, which made the book have a semblance of interest, but it is written in the most elementary, prosaic fashion, with characters who include a pretty woman cryptologist and a Harvard professor symbologist who studies the goddess legend. Jeez, how convenient to move the plot forward. I think the author must have found a cache of old movie serials shown at Saturday afternoon matinees in the early 50s. Each chapter has all the depth and surprise of a Flash Gordon episode--be sure to come next week to find out what happens. Of course the anticipation is always greater than actually seeing how Flash escapes this time--especially if you are over the age of 10.<br />It's kind of a mystery version of one of those &quot;Christmas Box&quot; romances that also seem to do so well. And just as preditable. There are lots better books out there than this one. I give two stars just because I learned a couple of things I didn't know before about the Magdalene legend.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This Dvd is based on the special aired earlier this year, but it has so much more.  There are more songs, and is totally entertaining.  It is totally worth you money.  Shania Rocks
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Firstly this cd was bought for me for Christmas but my wife allowed me one listen before wrapping it up. My initial reaction is Wow!So clean, the vocals so pure, you can actually sense these tracks were recorded yesterday not some 30 years ago. The long and winding road is so sweet it will bring tears to your eyes and raise the hairs on your arms. This is by far not my fave Beatles cd but this is leaps and bounds better than anything sonicaly that is available in their catalogue. Why oh why won't E.M.I. clean all their studio albums up to this degree...I for one will repurchase the lot again for the third time.I can only hope it will happen in my life time.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD is a must for all Shania fans.  Everyone should buy it.  If you are not a  fan already you will be once you see this DVD.  This lady has class.  She rocks the stage.  Every song is great.  For a very entertaining evening, this DVD is a must for anyone.  Get one now...
B0000048CP|5.0|This is possibly the most influential black metal albums ever. Even though this album is almost twenty years old, it blows all mallcore crap away! No poseur is safe from the mighty Bathory!<br />     This is the album that heavily influences many styles like Death Metal, Black Metal, Power Metal and Viking Metal. The songs are fast paced and really heavy for the most part, the title track and the intro being the only exceptions. Quality wise, this album sounds terrible; its obviously a vinal transfer (ie. you can hear the needle sometimes; especially during the intro, and its mono sound) but it sort of adds a bit of atmosphere to it and it does not really affect the album. There is an obvious Slayer influence since some of the songs sound similar to Hell Awaits which came out the same year this album did. The high points of the album are The Golden Walls of Heaven, Pace 'Till Death, Holocaust, and the ten and a half minute Viking epic Blood Fire Death. IF YOU'RE A TRUE METAL FAN, BUY THIS GREAT ALBUM!!!!!!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Wow, This album is like a recipe with Ac/Dc, lynyrd skynyrd, the clash and even some beatles. They've got their fare share of hard pure rock, and then some soft sweet ones. Lyrics are nice, very catchy, and the only thing keeping them from coming right out of the 70's is the superior sound quality. i VERY highly reccomend this album if you love to rock.
B000002MU3|5.0|I don't understand why people dis this fine album!  In my opinion this album really rocks hard.  It is catchy and gets you going, unlike alot of the other rem albums out there.  Don't get me wrong I love REM but some of there songs are too mello.  This album is one of the best from this fine band and I think the guitar riffs are great!! If you are a hard rock fan or an REM fan go out and buy this album, you can find it pretty cheap.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I LOVE THE DVD AND I ENJOY ANY THING SHANIA TWAIN DOES, IM A HUGE FAN OF HERS SO IS MY YOUNGEST SON ANTHONY IM A HUGE COLLECTOR ALSO POSTERS, REMIXES, CDS, TOUR PROGRAMS, AND I SAW HER IN 1998 SHE WAS GREAT I LOVE HER ENERGY PLEASE SHANIA COME TO PEORIA, ILLINOIS  A DEVOTED FAN CATHY AND ANTHONY
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is the &quot;Let It Be&quot; that Paul &amp; John had intended for release all along...until Phil Spector applied his &quot;wall of sound&quot; to it, thereby overlaying enough muzak so as to hide the basic quality of the material. The vocals in &quot;Let It Be&quot; are breathtaking...the guitar work by George in &quot;I Me Mine&quot; is so transparent...and &quot;Long &amp; Winding Road&quot; is as pure &amp; uncluttered as it was meant to be.&quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; is a joy to hear in its uncluttered form!..A super classic for old &amp; new Beatles fans alike...don't miss it!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|First off, the movie is in 2.35:1.  There has been some discussion as to this point, with several people wondering about the initial disclosure that the movie would be released in 1.77:1.  2.35:1 is the original aspect ratio that was seen during the movie's initial theatrical release.  All of the italian actors are dubbed, after all, Sergio Leone is italian and the movie was shot in Italy except for the scenes on the road leading to a local &quot;watering hole&quot;.  These scenes were shot in Arizona's Monument Valley.  I have seen every John Ford movie made and recognize every one of the rock formations that Ford so beautifully shot in his western trilogy:  Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and The Searchers.  I won't go into too much depth as to the plot other than to say the movie is certainly an allegory on good vs. evil, revenge, and certainly the ending of the western &quot;horse culture&quot; giving way to &quot;the Iron Horse&quot;.  I have already mentioned three of John Ford's masterpieces that also happen to be on numerous people's greatest Westerns of all time, as they are certainly on mine.  Before I bought the OUATITW dvd, I would have said that for me, Ford's and John Wayne's &quot;The Searchers&quot; was the greatest western of all time (it was John Wayne's favorite), and it still may be.  But after seeing &quot;Once Upon a Time...&quot; on dvd with its brilliant remastering of sight and sound and seeing it in its full aspect ratio, I could be persuaded that &quot;Once Upon a Time...&quot; could have usurpted the title from &quot;The Searchers&quot;.  But whether &quot;Once Upon a Time...&quot; is number one, two, or seven on the greatest list, it is most assuredly on the list.  &quot;Once Upon a Time...&quot; did not even receive a nomination for Best Picture when it came out, much less receive the award, but that travesty was due to Hollywood politics at the time and had nothing to do with the greatness of &quot;Once Upon a Time...&quot;.  The musical score by Ennio Morricone has got to be THE GREATEST score for any movie ever made.  Better than &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, better than &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;, and better than another Leone/Morricone collaberation, &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot;.  The music is haunting, truly.  And if that weren't enough, all of the major characters have their own musical riffs that introduce them and follow them throughout the movie whenever they are the focal point of a scene.  Very clever and rarely seen.  I know that I said at the outset that I was not going to talk much about the movie, and here I've gone and done exactly that.  This review was to concentrate on the absolute perfection of the dvd itself, and I do mean perfection.  Besides the aspect ratio and musical score, the remastering of the images defies belief.  It's like looking through air in real life.  You can see the pores in the faces.  I have never seen a more pristine dvd ever, and I've got at least 1,000 of them.  Utterly flawless!  (P.S. Alot of movie goers have seen at least one or more of Sergio Leone's movies, but few have ever seen the man.  He did keep a low profile.  But if you would like to see him, get his also brilliant &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;.  He is the ticket seller who sells Robert DeNiro a bus ticket out of town.  This man is truly one of the greatest directors of all time.)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love this CD....just got it today and I can't turn it off!  It's a great mix of dancy tunes with a little hip hop flavour.  Personally I think the song everytime is about Justin Timberlake but see what you think. This album won't disappoint....well worth buying!
B00005B36H|5.0|Such a fantastic album, a must have for any half-decent record collection. The lyrics were insightful, broad-ranging and generally thought-compelling. James Maynard-Keenan brings a humanity to the face of a genre of music which has before lacked a soft voice. &quot;Those who ignore a scream may strain to hear a whisper&quot; Archbishop sir Desmond Tutoo. Nobody should have any excuse not to have this album. It is simply brilliant.
B0000C0FJB|2.0|Big fan of RUSH. Not a big fan of this album. Imagine going to see RUSH in concert and you finally get to your seat located next to the roof rafters. You grab your seat figuring okay at least I am at the concert and then that guy you saw in the parking lot with the slash hat on and the big busy hair smoking everything he can get his hands on sits down right in front of you, but not on the seat but on the back of the seat and every once in a while he falls into your lap. Welcome to RUSH in Rio. The music is great. You can hear everything. The crowd is great. They are heard singing and yelling. But you can't hear the bands vocals though. I don't understand it. Mega band can't find recording equipment to let the fans hear the lyrics. If this is the future of the recording industry, then they are in serious trouble. My advice---buy the studio albums---or Chronicles. Now Chronicles is a great RUSH album. Forget Rio. I already have put the cd into the back of the cabinet until my next garage sale.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This record has been such an amazing piece of music to me. I have cried to it, rejoiced with it and sought comfort in it during sorrow. The majesty and power of &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; is equal to Nirvana's breakthrough hit &quot;Smells like teen spirit&quot;. Suprisingly, the best songs arn't even singles. &quot;Quiet&quot; is a powerful dark brooding song about alienation and the pining for acceptance and isolation and solace all at the same time! Triple themes in a 3 minute song. &quot;Hummer&quot; is a mini opus, complete with great instrumental breaks.&quot;Soma&quot; is perhaps, the best song on the record, with a musical marriage of extremes. &quot;Geek U.S.A.&quot; and &quot;Silver@#$%&quot; are also similar in this way. The most moving tracks are &quot;Spaceboy&quot;, &quot;Disarm&quot; and &quot;Mayonaise&quot;. I would recommend this album very highly. It is the Smashing Pumpkin's best album. &quot;Mellon Collie and the infinte sadness&quot; is almost a masterpeice of sorts, but this is more tighly focused and it is as good as &quot;Nevermind&quot;, or &quot;Ten&quot; and perhaps, even better!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I Love This CD.<BR>I never really liked Britney Spears and I never bought a cd by her until this one.I personally like the Cd...<BR>I Love the song Everytime... Sad song but she sings it Beautiful....<BR>I don't know why all the Bad reviews...
B0000E1WNV|1.0|Is 5.1 surround yet another problem with this DVD. States on packaging that 5.1 surround and there is a selection on the menu under audio options. However, this appears to be another problem with the DVD. It is a shame that an icon like Bruce is treated in this manner.
B0000CAQ26|1.0|Yet another bad album by pink.The songs had no life or substance to them and had very weak production.I cant find one good song on the entire album.She really needs to get her act together if she wants to remain in the music industry.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Just a few words for all the world...<BR>Without any question : \\"THE BEST OF 2003\\"
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This album is even worse than the horrible britney album.The album is a true disaster because she tries to incorporate too many different styles of music which simply does not work.All the songs were simply boring and her vocals are mediocre like always.Yet again she is trying to sell her image on cover and by writing x rated and nasty lyrics.She believes that everyone is buying into her bull,especially naive little girls.If I was a parent I would not allow my kids to be listening to this very poor role model.BE WARNED.You will not like this garbage!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|WOW!! Shania is absolutely amazing and phenomenal!! I watched this DVD with rapt attention.  It has been a long while since I have seen a performance with as much energy and crowd interaction as was in the UP! concert.  Again if you haven't already bought this DVD I strongly recommend it for any Shania fan.

B000003TA4|3.0|Good Album, but Nirvana is NOT the greatest band in the world and is certainly not the most influential band ever.  Neither is Pearl Jam, you people can't be rock fans and not even recognize the fact that Led Zeppelin is the end all and be all of rock.  They are the greatest, most influential band ever.  Without them, you have no &quot;grunge rock&quot;  Get with the program, its just a sad coincidence that all the mainstream music after the very early 90's has sucked.  &quot;MTV is to music as KFC is to fried chicken&quot;

Era un mensaje muy fuerte, y la pelcula estaban llena de emociones intensas de una perspectiva moral pero tambin de una perspectiva humana y de la naturaleza. Creo que el director hizo un trabajo justo de retratar cada perspectiva de los grupos. Tambin creo que aunque esta pelcula tiene casi 20 aos todava tiene un gran impacto en la luz de los problemas que estn ocurriendo hoy. Elogio a Joff en su esfuerzo de educar a ms gente sobre las condiciones que los indios tienen que aguantar.  <BR>Es muy importante en este da y edad para que la gente entienda ms de las culturas de otras sociedades. Para que el mundo prospere y contine teniendo xito, la gente debe aceptar el hecho de que otras culturas son parte del conjunto. El mundo sera ms pacfico si la gente abriera sus corazones y mentes para aprender ms cosas ms all de las paredes de su propia cultura. <BR>Recomendara fuertemente que profesores utilicen este vdeo no solamente en clases de espaol sino tambin de historia, sociologa, psicologa e igual posiblemente clases de la religin.

B00005JMJ5|3.0|A film by Robert Benton<br />I was actually looking forward to this movie.  I loved the Philip Roth novel that this movie was based on, and there is some serious acting talent involved.  The director is the same one who made Kramer VS Kramer.  With all of this talent, and all of this promise, the film does not ultimately deliver.<br />This film is narrated (periodically) by Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise).  Zuckerman is a writer who is living in a cabin near Athena College.  He tells us about Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins).  Coleman was the Dean of Athena College.  He retired in the midst of a rather large scandal due to an alleged racial slur he made in a classroom (\\"are they real, or are they spooks\\").  In context, he was asking if two students were ghosts.  Out of context, he asked if two students (who had not attended a single class in 5 weeks) were spooks, and those two students turned out to be black.  Coleman turned to Zuckerman to write the story of this absurd charge.  Zuckerman says that he can't write it, but as Coleman and Zuckerman become friends, we are shown Coleman's life in the past and present.<br />The racist allegation is absurd because Coleman, despite his white skin, is a black man.  His parents are black (though light skinned), his sister and brother are black.  Coleman just happens to have skin so light he can pass as a white man (it's not impossible, a minor white character in the film is actually played by a black man).  We see Coleman's past, and see how he decides to identify himself a white man rather than accept who and what he is.<br />In the present, Coleman has begun an affair with Faunia Farely (Nicole Kidman), a woman 40 years younger than he is.  Coleman's wife had died, and Faunia just seems to want sex and a little companionship.  Coleman feels like a new man (all the while extolling the virtues of Viagra).  The only problem is that Faunia's ex-husband Les (Ed Harris) is still stalking her and is angry and resentful towards both Faunia and Coleman.<br />The movie weaves these two stories together (the past and present), and together it makes up The Human Stain.  While this worked incredibly well in the novel, in the film it seems to be missing something.  The parts are greater than the whole.  The acting in this movie is fantastic.  This may be Ed Harris's best work in several years (despite his recent Academy Award nominations).  Hopkins, Kidman, and Sinise are all solid.  The only failing is in the construction of the movie.  It all fits together, but it doesn't seem to work as well as it should.  The Coleman/Faunia storyline is the main story, but anytime the movie slips into flashback, we are taken completely out of that previous story (despite how well done the flashbacks are).  The other problem is that there just isn't a whole lot to the Coleman/Faunia story.  The Human Stain has a lot to recommend it, but when taken as a whole...it just doesn't succeed or live up to its pedigree.both Faunia and Coleman.  <br />The movie weaves these two stories together (the past and present), and together it makes up The Human Stain.

0780622553|5.0|John Murdock(Rufuss Sewel)is in trouble. He just woke up in a motel room, and has no memory of how he got there. To make matters worse, there is a dead woman next to him, and he soon discovers that he is the prime suspect in a murder investigation involving prostitutes. He is being chased on both sides of the law. Inspector Frank Bumstead ( William Hurt) is a skilled cop that never gives up. He only believes in what he sees, and in his eyes, John is a murderer. But things are about to get a lot worse when John discovers his other pursuers. &quot;The Strangers&quot; are a mysterious group of beings that possess the ability to stop time and alter reality. John is now determined to solve the riddle of why the city is always different day after day, why it's always dark, and why they are after him. The only problem, is that the truth could be fatal... <br />&quot;Dark City&quot; is one of the best Sci-Fi films that you will ever see. The story is in a gotham like city set in the 1940's. All of the costume and building designs are outstanding. Next, the story is extremely original. The idea of being able to alter reality, and keep it from an entire city is actually interesting. Alex Proyas did a great job with how he worked the characters into the story. All the main characters play an important part, and help to further develop the plot. Rufuss Sewel was outstanding as John Murdock. His determination to find out why he's so special is unreal, and when you find out why the &quot;Strangers&quot; are targeting him, you will be very surprised. Jennifer Connelly is great as John's wife. The emotion that she shows is very realistic. Nice chemistry between her and Sewell. Kiefer Sutherland gave my favorite performance. He is the wild scientist that helps &quot;The Strangers&quot; with their mission. It was definately a different role for Sutherland, but still great. William Hurt was great as Frank Brumstead. Plays the typical cop who only believes in rational explanations. &quot;The Strangers&quot; themselves were excellent and actually frightening. <br />&quot;Dark City&quot; is one of my favorite films. The settings, acting, and extremely original story make it a masterpiece in the Sci-Fi genre. The DVD does not have much in the way of extras, but it still the best choice because of the quality and the fact that it is extremely affordable. Definaley a must own!
B0000TB03W|5.0|I borrowed this DVD from a friend that purchased it today, and let me say that this is one of the best quality concert DVDs I have seen.  The sound and clarity is second to none.  As far as the content goes, there are definitely more songs on this DVD than one could hope for, and most of them are her greatest hits, with some new ones thrown in for a little variety.  Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD like I am going to do.  If you're not a Shania fan yet, you probably will be by the time you are done watching this concert.
6305252521|5.0|Truman Burbank ( Jim Carrey) is a television star and he doesn't even know it. When he was a only a baby, he was adopted by a man named Cristof (Ed Harris). Cristof came up with the idea of the Truman Show. The show revolves solely around Truman himself, and the life that he leads. The city that he lives in is constructed specifically for the show, and everone in it is an actor playing a part. Even his wife ( Laura Linney), and best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich). The world has been watching Truman since he was a baby, and it is the number one rated show in the country. But gradually Truman starts to realize what is going on... <br />I am a huge fan of Jim Carrey. All of his movies have been entertaining from &quot;The Mask&quot; and &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, to his latest film &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;. However, the film that I enjoyed him the most in, concentrated less on the typical slapstick comedy that one has come to expect from a Jim Carrey film, and more on making you laugh through emotion and subtlety. The story itself is highly original and entertaining. The idea of one man being oblivious to the world aroud him is extremely funny. The fact that he is the center of a TV show only makes it funnier. All of the actors do an outstanding job. Of course Carrey steals the show with Truman. The transition from being naive, to a determined man is amazing. He plays both sides so well. Laura Linney is outstanding as his wife. She must put on the happy homemaker facade and pretend to love Truman. The funniest thing about the character is how she must constantly advertise products with everything that she does. Noah Emmerich is great as his best friend Marlon. Watching him try to convince Truman that it is just his mind playing tricks on him is hillarious. Even when a stage light falls from the sky, or it is sunny at 9:00 p.m., him and the rest of the actors try to convince Truman he is seeing things. Ed Harris does a nice job with Cristof considering the limited amount of screen time he had. It is also dissapointing as well. For such an important character, he has very little to do with the overall story. The rest of the actors in the film also do a great job as well. <br />&quot;The Truman Show&quot; will make you laugh, and keep you on the edge of your seat, wondering if Truman will ever get out. The ending is very satisfying too. This is definately Carrey's best film. He and the rest of the cast does an amazing job, and really makes the film believeable. The DVD is somewhat dissapointing though. I would have loved to seen a making of featurette. Unfortunately, there is just the movie and the trailer. I have never been able to understand why movie studios feel that offering a trailer as a special feature is an added bonus. If you are going to watch the film, then why would you need to see a movie trailer? This is a must own, but go with the VHS!!
B000002UB3|5.0|Although LET IT BE would become the Beatles' last official album to be released, in actuality it was ABBEY ROAD that was the Fab Four's last recorded album as a group (LET IT BE was shelved because of the production problems).  The Beatles did make a ton of great music during their ten years together in the '60s, but ABBEY ROAD is my personal favorite of theirs.  Knowing that the end was near, John, Paul, George, and Ringo gave it all they got and unleashed a truly ambitious album which showed that they still had plentiful ideas in their heads despite the impending break-up.  It's a very emotional album as well and further deepens the core of the band.<br />The album is divided into two halves: the first half has 8 individual songs and the second half is an entire 14-minute classical-inspired suite comprised of 9 songs combined together.  &quot;Come Together&quot; kicks off the album.  Although it's considered a classic by many, I never really liked it and found Lennon's lyrics to be silly, but it's the only weak spot on the album.  It's smooth sailing from there.  &quot;Something&quot; is the first of two George Harrison tunes on the record, and it's a really beautiful love song with a great guitar solo in the middle.  &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; is a goofy song written by Paul about a stalker who kills people with...you guessed it, a ball-peen silver hammer.  Despite the subject manner, this is a very upbeat number with a catchy chorus.  The bluesy &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; is the best of the regular songs, with terrific wailing vocals from Paul and solid guitar work and drumming.  The country-flavored &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; is a nice happy number with great vocals from Ringo.  The 7-minute mini-epic &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot; is the heaviest and darkest song the band ever did.  The same lyrics are repeated throughout by Lennon, but it begins to achieve a creepy disturbance, especially in the last few minutes (that guitar sound is crazy!).&quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; is the second Harrison tune and it's a bonafide classic.  Awesome lyrics and acoustic guitars make it one of the band's most endearing songs.  &quot;Because&quot; ends the first half on an eerie note with those haunting keyboards, but the three-part harmonies by Paul, George, and John are spellbinding - the best harmonies they ever did.<br />Now we come to the highlight: the side 2 &quot;Abbey Road&quot; medley.  It begins with &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money,&quot; which starts off as a sad ballad-type song but switches into a catchy rocker with Paul and Ringo trading vocal duties.  It then segues into &quot;Sun King&quot; which has to be one of the most relaxing songs ever written.  It's then followed by the quirky &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard,&quot; the hard-rocking &quot;Polythene Pam,&quot; and the melodic &quot;She Came in Through the Bathroom Window.&quot;  The last three parts of the suite end it on an emotional high note.  &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; is an awesome ballad that furthers the emotion with the powerful &quot;Carry That Weight,&quot; and &quot;The End&quot; reprises the main themes and ends with one of the most famous Beatle lyrics: &quot;And in the end/The love you take/Is equal to the love/You Make.&quot;  Awesome.  The short 23-second ditty by Paul called &quot;Her Majesty&quot; officially ends the record.<br />ABBEY ROAD is an undisputed masterpiece of rock &amp; roll and deserves all the accolades it gets.  The Beatles showed more promise and creativity than any other '60s act at that time and when the break-up finally hit a year later, we wondered what could have been.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equlibrium is set in a futuristic society, where a strict regime has eiliminated war by suppresing emotion and destroying everything that causes it - books, art, music, animals, etc.. To keep everyone in line, the government administers a mind altering drug that hinders emotion called Prozium. A form of police called the Clerics, have been created to enfore the law, and anyone who breaks it by feeling or showing emotion is put to death. John Preston ( Christian Bale), is the highest ranking Cleric who is responsible for destroying anyone who breaks the rules. But John is soon effected by a prisoner ( Emily Watson), who claims that you cannot truly live life unless you are able to feel, and experience emotion. To test her theory, he skips his next dose of Prozium. Right away, John sees that the society that he helped create, has been wrong all along. John has been trained to enforce the laws of the new regime at all costs, but he is now the only person capable of overthrowing it. His partner (Taye Diggs)sets his eyes on John's position, and becomes determined to stop him... <br />I was literally blown away by this film. Director Kurt Wimmer did a great job creating the future society, with the outstanding visuals. While the story is similar to &quot;Fahrenhiet 451&quot; in some aspects, the story still manages to keep your interest and seem original for the most part. &quot;Equilibrium&quot;, is also the best action film I have seen in recent memory. Even &quot;The Matrix&quot; pales in comparison. When I first saw this film at the theater, everyone in the audience was literally gasping and making comments about how original and amazing the action was. A totally original form of martial art was introduced in this film called &quot; The Gun Kata&quot;. It mixes martial arts together with gun play to create a more effective shooting technique. Watching this new type of self defense unfold on the screen was mind blowing. The ending to this film is great and features oneof the best sword fights I have ever seen.<br />Christian Bale puts in another good performance. He plays both sides of John Preston so well. The first is the Cleric who feels nothing, and kills anyone who breaks the law. He looks down right menacing! The second, is the man that comes to believe what he is doing is wrong. Watching him feel for the first time will amaze you, because he gave such an accurate portrayal of what it would really be like. Taye Diggs did an outstanding job as his partner. He is dispicable and a truly great villan. Emily Watson, Angus MacFadyen and Sean Bean were also fantastic in their roles. <br />&quot;Equlibrium&quot; raised the bar of action films to a whole new level. The gun play, martial arts action, and overall violence will blow your mind. It is fast paced, realistic, and extremely gory!! The visuals are stunning as well, and the performances are great. Once this film becomes more well known, it will have people talking for a long time to come!
B0000E1ALR|3.0|No one can possibly say The Boss is not entitled to a greatest-hits/essentials retrospective.  Bruce Springsteen has had one of the most storied careers in rock history, releasing album after album of music that stands up to time and future generations.<br />Thing is, one would have expected something a bit more...shall we say, expansive, or at least more selective of his catalog.<br />Bruce addresses it on the CD itself, saying basically that his music, like most everything in life, is subjective to taste.  Problem is, even the die-hard fans as well as the unfamiliar would probably want something that covers the singles and FM-radio cuts, as well as the most well-known compositions from all of his previous releases.  <br />What's here, mostly, does belong here, as a reflection of Springsteen's career and successes on the charts and the airwaves.  And it sounds as fine as you might expect.  But to leave off singles from \\"Born In The U.S.A\\" and his other successful albums approaches the criminal.  \\"Cover Me\\", \\"I'm On Fire\\", \\"My Hometown\\", \\"War\\" (from the 4-CD live set), \\"Fire\\", \\"Pink Cadillac\\", \\"Prove It All Night\\", \\"Fade Away\\", \\"One Step Up\\", \\"Better Days\\"---granted, all singles and popular cuts subject to taste and appreciation, but nevertheless, missing.  <br />To reflect his career, The Boss has yet to find a hits package that's complete, varied, or comprehensive enough for many.  That said, though, the surprises and fun stuff on Disc Three (and, to be fair, the end of Disc Two) do redeem it very nicely.  Live cuts, including the controversial \\"American Skin\\", and the theme to the movie \\"Dead Man Walking\\" , among others, lets the listener dig a little deeper into his music and come away with a more rounded appreciation for what they may not have heard on the radio.<br />All in all, like Sony's other \\"Essential\\" CDs, \\"Essential Springsteen\\" comes up to a certain edge, but shies away from being definitive for the artist.  Granted, there's a lot of terrain to coveron Bruce Springsteen, and it's a bigger and better appreciation than his 1995 \\"Greatest\\" package, but what keeps me from fully embracing it is in what's missing.  Still, to give a taste to new fans of the Boss of his music, it's a quite good place to start, if not the last word.
0767817710|5.0|Gunfighters test their skills against each other in a contest where the winner is the one left alive. Herod ( Gene Hackman) is the most dangerous outlaw that ever lived. He used his gunfighting skills to seize control of the town Redemption, where the story takes place. He is putting on the competition to see if he still has what it takes. &quot;The Lady&quot; ( Sharon Stone) has come to Redemption to seek revenge on Herod for a past injustice. &quot;The Kid&quot; ( Leonardo DiCaprio) is fast on the trigger, and even faster with his mouth. He is also Herod's son. He wants to stop living in his father's shadow, and prove that he is a better gunfighter. Cort ( Russell Crowe) used to run with Herod, and is the most skilled gunfighter around. But now he is a preacher, and has sworn off all forms of violence. He is tracked down, and forced to compete by Herod himself. Herod has always wanted to see who was better - him or Cort. <br />The camera work is outstanding in this film. Every element of each gunfight is captured effectively. The film can also be extremely funny at times, because all of the actors use modern slang, despite the story taking place in the 1800's. The setting to this film is outstanding. The town of Redemption is the typical Western town, with the saloons, gunfighters, etc. It is very authentic. All of the actors are outstanding in their roles. There is constant tension and emotion that all of them bring to the movie - Hackman wanting to see if he still has what it takes, Stone with her desire for revenge, Crowe with his unwillingness to kill, and DiCaprio wanting to prove that he is better than his dad. The film overall is outstanding, because you end up rooting for all of the characters, and want none of them to lose. This makes the film extremely suspenseful. <br />Sam Raimi steps outside the horror genre, and into the wild west, with the highly entertaining and action packed &quot;Quick and the Dead&quot;! The film offers a well rounded cast, andan extertaining, fast paced, and authentic western story. If you love Westerns, or any of the actors involved, pick this one up!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I loved Me against the music-I am a madonna fan from her early days and thought the hook up between them was pretty cool.I went out and bought the CD because of that.<BR>Not only does Britney Spears get Madonna to sing but she sounds like she listened to everybodys CDs and then ripped off the sound!Or her &quot;collaborators&quot; did.Whatever.<BR>She copied Avrils sound in one song,Kylie minogues in another and then she is rapping!??Britney Spears the rapper.Okay.Now I have heard it all!<BR>Touch of my hand is about as juevenile as you can get.Britney is still a teeny bopper.The music is more dance oriented but thats about all that has changed.<BR>I was expecting alot more since some big name producers were working on this album with her.<BR>It truly does disappoint unless you are a die hard Britney fan-of which I am not so take my words with a grain of salt and dont say you werent warned.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The story is set in Mississippi during the Great Depression. The silver tongued Everett McGill ( George Clooney)busts loose from a prison farm. However, he is still shackled to his two chain-mates from the chain gang - the bad tempered Pete ( John Turturo)and the sweet and dimwitted Delmar ( Tim Blake Nelson). With nothing else to lose, the trio sets off in search of buried treasure that will help them all start new lives. Everett claims that he stole and buried over one million dollars in cash. The only problem is that they only have four days to find it before it is lost forever at the bottom of a reservoir. But as luck would have it, they keep running into strange situations, and even stranger people. The trio steals a car, and eventually pick up a guitar playing hitchiker. To make some extra money, they stop at a radio station and pose as a music group called &quot;The Soggy Bottom Boys&quot;. The record that they cut soon becomes the hottest record in the reigon. However, the adventure does not stop there, as they encounter many more strange characters that include : a blind prophet, a bank robber ( Michael Badalucco), a crooked one-eyed bible salesman ( John Goodman), and Everet's ex-wife ( Holly Hunter)who is about to get re-married. This crazy adventure filled with close calls, near misses, and betrayals will have you laughing every step of the way. <br />Oh man, what an oustanding film. This film succeeds on so many levels. The first is the story itself. Watching the three run into one thing after the next will keep you entertained for the entire film. Next, is the amazing cast. George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturo are all spectacular in their roles. All three are extremely different, but will make you laugh the same. The supporting cast is quite good as well as features performances by Holly Hunter, Michael Badalucco, John Goodman, and Charles Durning. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the amazing soundtrack. It features a wide variety of different artists and each song is spectacular. Dan Tyminksi provides the singing voice for George Clooney on &quot;I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;. This is the Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features : Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch. <br />The acting is spectacular, the music is amazing, the story is extremely well rounded, and it is down right hillarious. The DVD is outstanding. You not only get great picture and sound quality, but outstanding extras as well. The DVD offers a behind the scenes featurette, the &quot; I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; music video, and so much more. Definately a must own
B0000TB03W|5.0|I was there and this definatly does the show justice. Shania just belts em out like no other!
B0000A36J5|5.0|I received my special extended version of The Two Towers yesterday, after waiting for months, and I can vouch that it is well worth the wait.  Like the extended edition of The Fellowship of the Ring, this version of The Two Towers enhances the theatrical release and far more fully reveals the faithfulness of Peter Jackson's vision to Tolkien's creation.  This is not to say that there aren't plenty of plot variations, some merely unfortunate (Aragorn's flirtatiousness with Eowyn) and others grating (the constant stream of Dwarf jokes). But the spirit and atmosphere of this movie must be the closest approximation possible to what Tolkien himself would have filmed, had he had the chance and the inclination to do so.<br />First, the extra material that comes with this special gift edition.  The statuette of Smeagol/Gollum is very nice and detailed, right down to the fish which looks to be still dripping wet. This turns out to be one half of a pair of bookends, and you are given information on how to order the other half (for about 80 bucks).  With the statuette comes an extra DVD on the Weta workshop which produced it.  There's some interesting material about how such things are made, but much of the program is really a commercial for Weta's products.<br />The actual extended version comes in a nice red leather-bookish looking case which folds out to display the four DVDs, two with the movie and two appendices with extra material.  A folder provides a road map or overview so you can quickly find your way to sections of interest.  There are many interviews with producers and actors and lots of pictures of sets, slideshows of sketch drawings of characters, and the like.  One particularly interesting section shows how the drowning of Isengard was planned using bunches of twigs, construction paper, tissue, and old rags. (You can do a side by side comparison here with a splitscreen showing the scene from the movie along with the planning video, which is quite interesting).<br />As for the movie itself, a fine film in theatrical release has now been turned into a masterpiece.  Scene after scene has been added or extended, and every addition and extension lends depth and beauty.  I'm particularly glad to see a nice nod to Tom Bombadil in the Fangorn segments.  Its the wrong book but at least some of him got into the movie after all.  Long time Tolkien fans, like me, will watch this film with continued shocks of delight as material pops up again and again that echoes the written word.  New Tolkien fans, or those who are only familiar with the movies, will find  much more to enjoy and gain a much better understanding of the history and cultures of the peoples and lands being depicted.  I won't go into too much detail here for fear of spoiling the surprises.<br />When Peter Jackson's film project was announced I was filled with trepidation lest these books, which I have loved since the age of 12 in 1969, would be forever cheapened.  I am now no longer so concerned, for while the films don't live up to the books (an impossible task), they have clearly been made with loving attention to detail and a niggling desire for perfection that matches Tolkien's own.  Buy this version of The Two Towers, along with the extended Fellowship of the Ring, and then watch and wait impatiently for The Return of the King to complete the vision.r />As for the movie itself, a fine film in theatrical release has now been turned into a masterpiece.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|I was a little wary when I bought it, she said she had a totally new sound...but it's awesome!  There are definitely highlights, such as &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; with Madonna.  &quot;Toxic&quot; is extremely catchy, has a great beat.  &quot;Touch Of My Hand&quot; is that ultra-controversial song that everyone's heard of by now, but it's strangely intriguing and makes you want to listen to Britney even more.  &quot;Shadow&quot; has a little bit of the old Britney sound, which is still good.  Finishing off the CD is &quot;Everytime&quot; which is possibly the best song done by Britney.  There is a TON of emotion in this one, and I love it.  <br />Britney's got this new trancey vibe going on, which could be hard to pull off, but she makes it work.  She's definitely all grown up!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I saw this in the theater four times and the DVD is even better! Seeing the concert from beginning to end is full of wonderful moments of bliss. Some are from surpising places; Anoushka Shanker, Joe Brown, Sam Brown. Clapton's playing is the best it has been since &quot;Layla.&quot; He is brilliant on the Shankar piece and seemingly God-like on &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps.&quot; And the pure joy of seeing Dhani Harrison playing with Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Eric Clapton and Klaus Voorman is close to Beatle heaven! As Olivia sais, &quot;With Dhani up there it looks like George stayed young while everyone else got old.&quot;<br />Every Beatle George fan should own this and watch it on November 29th. While the sound occasionally drops out a bit, it is close to perfection. I just have three questions; 1) Was that Bill Wyman in the audience? 2) Where was Bob Dylan (or Leon Russell)? and 3) Didn't anyone tell Dhani to sing into the mike? Hari Krisna.
B00009V7RF|5.0|The Most Orginal Cd out this year<BR>My Favs:<BR>Hands Up <BR>Labor Day (It's A Holiday)<BR>Let's Get Retarded <BR>Hey Mama <BR>Shut Up <BR>Smells Like Funk <BR>Latin Girls <BR>Fly Away <BR>The Boogie That Be<BR>Where Is The Love
B0000E6I1J|5.0|After hearing about this concert, I was shocked- I could only wish I was there.   When yesterday came around, I drove to my local Borders, which only had the CD, not the DVD :-(    Nevertheless, I picked up this CD and I definitely do NOT regret it- it's absolutely beautiful.   You can just feel that George was there in spirit- every performance has a touch of him.   My personal favorite cuts are &quot;I Want to Tell You,&quot; &quot;If I needed Someone,&quot; &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; &quot;I Need You&quot; (Petty is incredible), &quot;Handle With Care&quot; (Mike Campbell from the Heartbreakers plays a VERY George-esque solo), &quot;Something&quot; (Paul plays a ukelele inspired first part before Eric takes charge in the middle), and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps.&quot;   Being an avid Eric Clapton fan, I was not surprised how well Eric plays and how great his voice sounds, but I think he really makes the record.   George can now rest in peace- I hope to meet you one day, George.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is a long-awaited release for long-time and hardcore fans and is bound to be a pleasure for first-time fans.  &quot;Let It Be...Naked&quot; is everything that the original Phil Spector produced version claimed to be...but was not.  While the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; liner notes proclaim, &quot;In comes the warmth and freshness of a live recording,&quot; it simply fails to provide that experience for many Beatle fans.  This version certainly does in a most phenomenal way.<br />Producers Paul Hicks, Guy Massey, and Allan Rouse were given a free hand when compiling this version, creating yet a third mix of this album, the first (never officialy released) by Glyn Johns, the second by Spector.  Like the two previous producers, they worked with the original source tapes from EMI, but the use of modern technology was at their disposal.  You hear the tracks stripped down to their essential components -- instruments and vocals.  Tape hiss has been removed from the Savile Row studio tracks (which includes a shortened version of &quot;Get Back&quot; used for the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album).  &quot;Wind noise&quot; (along with tape hiss and other extraneous noise) has been removed from the four tracks compiled from the legendary rooftop concert tapes: &quot;Dig A Pony&quot;, &quot;I've Got A Feeling&quot;, &quot;One After 909&quot;, and &quot;Don't Let Me Down,&quot;  which has been added to the running order for the first time.  None of Spector's touches are evident here including the insertion of dialogue between some tracks.  Most obvious is the absence of strings and choirs<br />Definite highlights on this disc are &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; appearing in quality here that even surpasses the Anthology 3 version.  &quot;For You Blue&quot; is outstanding and presented in a way that would have undoubtedly pleased George Harrison who even considered stripping down his own album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, co-produced by Phil Spector.  The sound quality on this album is such that you are hearing a live performance, that you are actually there watching and listening to the Beatles play.<br />The second disc with studio chatter and dialogue is probably dispensable but was probably inevitable for this release given the hundreds and hundreds of bootlegs that are flooding the market.  The color booklet is a joy since it includes excerpts (pictures and transcripts) from Ethan Russell's book which accompanied the original release of &quot;Let It Be&quot; in England, yet never released in the U.S.  I believe this release would have been as signifcant and impressive with just the single disc.<br />Purists will argue that the original version is the true version.  The surrounding historical perspectives, arguably, support that claim.  But the &quot;truth&quot; is that, from another historical perspective, in the absence of business pressures, the original version is something that the Beatles probably would have thought twice about releasing.  This new version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; provides a view of the Beatles diluted, if not obstructed, by the first version (as well as by the accompanying film) -- working well together and being creative.  It's only fair that with Harrison's (and Lennon's) passing that &quot;the other side of the coin&quot; be shown.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The Good -   The sound quality is fantastic.  Can't believe how clear everything sounds and I must say you really do feel as if you're \\"there.\\"  Some of the songs have different vocal takes then on the original album which kinda makes you go \\"Hmmm... interesting.\\"  You also get the satisfaction that this was the album the Beatles intended to put out all those years ago.  The Bad -   Obviously, everyone knows this album the way it was originally released.  Yes, it's cool to hear a stripped down \\"de-Spectorized\\" version, but aside from the better sound quality, I can't say that this is necessarily better than the original release.  I disagree [...] that \\"Across The Universe\\" is better on this disc.  It's not.  Quite frankly, the orchestrations that went with it really made the song beautiful.  The same goes for \\"The Long And Winding Road.\\" My rationale for this is because these are ballads, not acoustic jams like the other songs on the album.  The way I look at this new release is simple.  I think it's cool to own this as a collector of Beatles stuff, but it won't replace the original as far as I'm concerned.  I would be really happy if they would remix and remaster the original release as well.  That would make everyone happy.
B0000CFW87|5.0|He's at it again! I know, I know, you've heard it a thousand times now...words like &quot;amazing&quot;, &quot;beautiful&quot;, and &quot;spectacular&quot;. I'm not writing a review to say that, because it's just too obvious. From what I've read, some think &quot;Closer&quot; is better than Josh's debut, while others don't think it quite measures up. I believe the two are equal. They hit me the same way, and I believe all his albums will continue to do this as long as he stays clean. This album is NOT overproduced -- my musical taste buds love a full sound and dramatic background/ effects. Even though most of the songs are slower (and a lot of the time in minor keys), this in no way detracts from the singer's talent and vocal impact. The only &quot;surprise&quot; on the disk is the last track (on the normal edition) with Deep Forest. Bit of a different flavor to it, and it may not do justice to all I know Josh is capable of. That's not to say you shouldn't purchase &quot;Closer&quot; -- that song will grow on me... things always happens that way. To sum it up, I don't want to wait another two years for the next CD!  Keep it up, Josh! Let's get moving and hit the radio with some GOOD music and REAL talent!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's definitely grown up with this fourth release. Beyond racier lyrics, the pure make-up of each song is reflective of established artists in the industry. Let's face it, she knows what she's doing. Gone are songs that sound as if they could be played in a music box. Instead, Britney gives us songs that could be played in dance clubs. Without having to be remixed. &quot;Early Mornin',&quot; &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom,&quot; &quot;Breathe On Me,&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot; are tracks to look out for. If music elists could just get their stuck up noses out of the air, forget all the teeny-bopperness of pre-21 Britney, and purchase the album (even if just for sh*ts and giggles), they'd be pleasantly surprised.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|As I sit here listening to her Album I am just incredibly elated. This is her best work ever...period! the fact that she wrote 8 of the 12 new tracks says a lot about her talent as an artist and why this album is her best work. People I know that arent really a fan are praising this CD. I as a huge fan expected nothing less. The best tracks are: Everytime,a powerful song she wrote herself on the piano;Touch of my hand, a dope mid-tempo sonic sounding joint; Toxic,crazy beats that make you get up and move;Breathe on Me, probably the most sensual very vibey;Boom Boom, hot hot hot song, Shadow, Me Against The Music. Well basically you wont want to skip a single track. BUY THE ALBUM ITS THE BEST HANDS DOWN.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney get a voice! I can't believe people put this girl ahead of Christina and Mariah Carey! Oh and I'm only doing this because some loser Britney fan keeps writing bad reviews of Mariah Carey's Remix album titled MARIAH CAREY THE REMIXES and she's wrote bad reviews about Charmbracelet! Look isn't it enough that you're no talent britney spears is on top! While great artist like Mariah Carey are pushed out! Well you have your fun cause one day it will be all over!
B0000CD5I6|4.0|Everyone that is searching for some past Jetrho Tull need only look to this Christmas CD. &quot;Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow&quot; was written 20-25 years ago, no doubt. It even has vintage Martin!
B000060K4O|5.0|Not to often will I call a movie perfect. However, Ghostbusters is one of those perfect movies.<br />After losing there jobs as scientists at the local University in New York three men Dr. Venkman(Murray), Dr. Spengler(Ramis), and Stantz(Aykroyd) set out to prove there right. They start a business to stop para-normal activity a.k.a Ghostbusting. They meet a Dana Barret(Weaver) who is having a ghost problem at her house. Venkman loves the woman and they decide to help her. In the meantime the rest of the city is in a craze over the ghosts and the ghostbusters are busting them like crazy. They hire some help Winston Zimmerman(Hudson). Back at Barrets though is a serious ghost uprising that is affecting her and her neighbor Louis. Will the Ghostbusters be able to stop it? Will Venkman keep his girlfriend? You'll just have to watch out and find out.<br />The movie was written by two of the stars Ramis and Aykroyd. They have written a perfect script. It has a great blend of humor. The comedey is slaptick, sarcastic, and very action oriented. Some of the greatest one liners ever spat out are in Ghostbusters.<br />Bill Murray is awesome. Dr. Peter Venkman is one of my favorite characters of all-time. Murray plays sarcastic roles to perfection and he does with Venkman. He is also quite charming in the movie. He really does steal the show. His one liners are classic. I'd laugh trying to say some of the stuff he says. That shows his caliber of an actor that he doesn't. He's one of the funniest guys in Hollywood if you like sarcasm. This role was suppose to have been played by John Belushi but his death gave the role to Murray.<br />Dan Aykroyd is great. He's one of the funniest men to ever live and grace a screen. The small or big it doesn't really matter. Ray Stantz is a great character. He's the kind of geek you wouldn't mind hanging out with. He's a sarcastic guy which Aykroyd can play to perfection. Aykroyd has played some funny people in movies and I rank Ray along side Elwood as his best ever.<br />Harold Ramis is awesome. He plays Igon Spengler in the movie. He is the loveable nerd. He is so nerdy it's funny. When he tells Janine he loves collecting spores, molds, and fungus. Thats great stuff a normal guy would never say. It's a shame Ramis hasn't stared in more movies like the rest of his ghostbusting mates. He's a great actor and is funny.<br />Sigourney Weaver is great in the movie. She plays off the other stars well. She is pretty in the movie. The movie wouldn't be the same without her. I think it's one of the better roles she ever did. I'd put it alond side Ripley as the best she's ever done. I like Dana a little better than Ripley because Dana won't kill you.<br />Rick Moranis is great as Louis. He is another loveable nerd you just love to like. Moranis has always played dorks, nerds, and under-achievers. Louis is a little of all three. He's one of the funniest side characters I can think of in a movie. He will definetly leave you laughing.<br />The special effects are great in Ghostbusters. You have to think this was a 1984 film. The ghosts look great. The dogs don't look so good, but you can only see that in the chase part with Louis. The ghostbusting equipment looks great. The explosions are good and it's some of the best special effects for it's time.<br />I love the theme song. Ray Parker Jr. sings it to perfection. If you haven't seen the movie I'm sure you've heard the song at some point. It's a great song that is catchy and will have you singing or whistling along side it.<br />Ghostbusters is a perfect movie. It has a perfect cast. It's a perfect script. There is a perfect mix of humor. The special effects are awesome. The DVD is a must own for Ghostbuster fans. This is one of the funniest and original movies you will ever see. It will leave you laughing and does what a movie should. It leaves you entertained.Elwood as his best ever.<br />Harold Ramis is awesome. He plays Igon Spengler in the movie. He is the loveable nerd.

B000002UAR|5.0|Who would compare Revolver with Pet Sounds? Pet sounds is without a doubt one of the most overrated albums ever done!Pet Sounds got as high as no 10 in june,1966 and was on the charts for 21 weeks.Revolver got to no 1(with a bullet,as they say),stayed there for 6 weeks,and stayed in the top 40 for 24 weeks.Besides,so much of Pet Sounds all sounds the same!Revolver has sold some 15 million copies to date,worldwide,Pet Sounds, a very small fraction of that...compare??? please!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|After four years, the public has watched this girl grow up.  After three hit records, she does it again with &quot;In The Zone&quot;.  So far, I think this is her best album to date.  He last album wasn't her best effort, but she makes up for it with this one!  Go buy it, you'll be pleasantly surprised!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Simply because the last 15 seconds of &quot;get back&quot; was edited out,which should have been included! Its inevitable that this version will be compared to the 1970 version for the next 50 years,so heres my take...Don't let me down is included,hooray,maggie mae and dig it have been dropped,smart move,many songs sound very different without Phil Spectors touch,which I kinda miss. The reality is this- Let it be 2003 is still light years better then anything out there today,with some of the Beatles greatest work (3 no 1 singles,get back,let it be, long and winding road),plus across the universe and two of us... I strongly recommend this version and the 1970 version!!!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|My parents own the original version on vinyl, and I did grow up with this album, being born in the 1970's.  I never really remembered the entire album, except for &quot;Let It Be&quot;, and &quot;Get Back&quot;.  I am a Beatles fan(who isn't), so when I was reading up on all the history behind this album, I figured, I would buy it and rediscover the Beatles, and I am glad I did.  Listening to Beatles music is so refreshing and rewarding, that you appreciate this music even more.  &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot;, is in the simplest terms terrific.  &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Get Back&quot;, still sound excellent and remain the classics they should be, but then you have a song I completely forgot about &quot;Across The Universe&quot;, which sounds, so clear, so sharp, it's as if you are in the recording studio.  And I found a few new but old songs as favorites, like &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Dig A Pony&quot;, just to name a few, but the album as a whole is a treat.  And as for &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot;(especially &quot;Let It Be&quot;) reminds me of my childhood and being part of my childhood, that's a great feeling and that is what music is supposed to do, take you back in time or away from the world, and that's what Beatles music does, it does whatever you want it to do.  My hope is that maybe one of these songs could see new life on the charts, but if not, the album as still amazing. There is nothing wrong with this album, in fact it's one of the best albums in my ENTIRE collection.  A++++++++ for one great album again.<br />1. &quot;Get Back&quot; A++++++<BR>2. &quot;Dig A Pony&quot; A+++++<BR>3. &quot;For You Blue&quot; A+++++<BR>4. &quot;Long And Winding Road&quot; A++++<BR>5. &quot;Two Of Us&quot; A+++++<BR>6. &quot;I've Got A Feeling&quot; A+<BR>7. &quot;One After 909&quot; A++++<BR>8. &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; A+++++++<BR>9. &quot;I Me Mine&quot; A+++++<BR>10. &quot;Across The Universe&quot; A+++++++++<BR>11. &quot;Let It Be&quot; A++++++++++++(one of the best songs ever)<br />Terrific...Terrific...Terrific, cannot say enough.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|LET IT BE... NAKED sounds more like THE BEATLES (White Album) to me.  Gone are over-produced versions of &quot;Accross the Universe&quot; and &quot;Long and Winding Road.&quot;  Just listening to &quot;Accross the Universe&quot; proved me that the original music should not have been tampered with.  Was LET IT BE the best album they released?  No.  However, this CD would have been much better.  I just wonder why they did not include &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot;?  I was hoping more for the original GET BACK album.  Remember, GET BACK was the original LET IT BE album before Phil Spector.  <br />My two favorite tracks from this CD are &quot;Accross the Universe&quot; which is absolutely lovely and simple version of WILD LIFE version, and &quot;Let It Be&quot; which had the sloppy guitar sound removed from the middle and the end.  Of five different version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; that I have, the version on this CD is the best.<br />Overall, the sound quality is much better than the original LET IT BE album (CD).  I am satisfied with this CD since I have been waiting for this for over 20 years.  Considering this CD is NOT a remastered version nor a new CD, some people will be disappointed with this.  Just keep in mind that this is what LET IT BE album should have been; not what was released.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is great!!! This is a great concert!!! She always does her best to do a great show!!! She puts her heart &amp; soul into what she does. Up Live In Chicago, a MUST HAVE.
B0000DYJM6|1.0|Sorry guys, but your last two actual studio albums were breathtakingly bad. Now you've gone and secreted this, a swollen double-disc compilation of B-sides and outtakes, of which approximately five songs (from the days of 'Ten' through 'Vitalogy') are of any merit. You've lost it, fellas, and you need to put a leash on your idiot frontman, Eddie Vedder. Wasn't he supposed to leave the US if Dubya was elected? Wasn't he going to keep his mohawk until Tibet was free? A man without philosophy (or, at least, the balls to stick with it) who keeps writing the same songs over and over and can barely raise his voice above a warble is not, in my opinion, an outstanding example of musical excellence. This record offers flashes of loveliness amidst a roiling sea of trash, and only demonstrates just how much of the plot Pearl Jam has really lost.<br />I'm glad I never bought it, just listened to it. My Pearl Jam collection is now off to the second-hand store, where I believe I shall trade it in for some albums that aren't twenty percent magic, eighty percent nonsense.<br />On top of that, your website is ridiculous and unhelpful, and judging from the photos, you all seem to be aging very quickly. Since you can't give it up while you're still ahead, why not just give it up?
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Finally! The &quot;Let It Be&quot; album without all that crud that Spector put on it.  Although some tracks sound more or less the same (Dig A Pony, Two Of Us) other songs are as different from the original as night and day.  &quot;Across The Universe&quot; as it is here is an absolute tear-jerker, and the versions of &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot;, and &quot;I Me Mine&quot; are far superior to the old versions.  George Martin knew his stuff, and bringing in Phil Spector to produce the original album was an awful idea. REM, Coldplay, and Radiohead have nothing on these guys; however if creative, inspired music isn't your thing and the meaningless pander of these new bands is, be my guest.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is Shania at her best!!! Her music is energizing, and insprirational and it is always such a pleasure to watch her perform live!! I only wish that I could've been there to watch it myself, but having this DVD is the next best thing.  &quot;She's not just a pretty face&quot; and Yes, Shania Twain has everything it takes!!!  Enjoy a good time with one of country's greatest &quot;divas&quot;...Shania Twain<br />Pooh4292

B0000CEB4V|5.0|Thank you, Eric Clapton, for organizing the wonderful Sept. 2002 Concert for George at the Royal Albert Hall, and for making sure it was filmed and recorded so beautifully. Director David Leland has delivered what may be the greatest concert film of all time.<br />Anoushka Shankar doesn't possess the genious of her father, but her rendition of &quot;Your Eyes&quot; is wonderful, an inspired start to the program, and the fully orchestrated &quot;Arpan&quot; she conducts is gorgeous in a way only music from the subcontinent can be. The concluding acoustic guitar solo by Clapton is incredible. Harrison made sure western ears heard Shankar's music, though too many westerners, who love harmony above all else in music, don't appreciate the pure melody and complex time changes of Indian music. I fell in love with Indian classical through Harrison's music, and I owe him a debt of gratitude for it.<br />The western band, led by Clapton &amp; Jeff Lynne, delivers picture perfect renditions of a batch of Harrison's best songs from the length and breadth of his career; many of their versions are better than any Harrison, who had a nasty habit of re-working his own material with maddingly spotty results, ever delivered on stage.<br />I've never understood Ringo as a frontman and don't like that McCartney plays no bass on stage, but the program gets a second wind with the appearances of the former Beatles. <br />For me the emotional highlights of the program are McCartney's ukelele version of &quot;Something,&quot; which turns into a note-for-note replication of the ABBEY ROAD version, with Clapton on lead guitar and Starr's drums sounding like cannons; and Joe Brown's closing &quot;I'll See You In My Dreams.&quot; Wonderful, wonderful stuff.<br />It is the perfect wake that we should all hope for ourselves; a warm, funny, loving, beautiful--but never maudlin--tribute; a celebration of the life of the Quiet Beatle, who changed so many millions of our lives.<br />Thank you, Eric Clapton.
B0000931QR|5.0|I'm absolutely hooked on this group. Their creativity is remarkable.  The way they connect tempos, rhythms and Amaias voice is Spanish music at its best. Their music is upbeat and although I consider LODVG a pop/rock group with a taste of the 80's - they are filling a void to a vacuum of fun and uplifting music that has been missing from today's contemporary groups. Their lyrics have a touch of naivete- of romance and innocence, of hope and optimism with  ingenious sophistication.<BR>This is an A++ album- highly recommend it.<BR>My favorite tracks?<BR>Un Mundo Mejor - sound like a mix of Duran Duran w/the Gogos<BR>Vestido Azul- Classy<BR>Perdoname- Rock with a jazzy flavor<BR>La paz de tus ojos - profound love

B0000DD7LB|1.0|I have been a fan of Britney since &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; came out and I have loved all of her albums until this one.  The album starts out great with &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; with Madonna which I love. &quot;Boom Boom&quot; is good, I like the beat.  After the second track the album goes downhill and FAST.  &quot;In The Zone&quot; is different from her past albums and it is good to see her doing something a little different.  But this album was a complete waste of money.
B00003CXB4|4.0|Disney's Lion King looks at first glance to be very similar to Bambi - the storyline is complimentary.<br />Look at the facts.  Simba's father dies in Lion King.  Bambi's mother dies in Bambi.  Bambi and Simba try to run away from their problems.  Finally, Bambi returns to take his father's place as ruler.  Simba does the same thing.<br />But on second glance, there is much more here than Bambi in the Pridelands.  Bambi only has one motivation to return - because of his girlfriend, Faline.  Simba, however, has both Nala - and the revenge he eventually takes on Scar for killing his father.  Thus Simba has a deeper, more well developed character than Bambi.<br />Simba starts as a youngster wanting to be king, then is forced out of his future role by Scar, then is placed back into it by Nala and Rafiki.  This gives him a much more complex character than Bambi.  Simba's travels add to the richness of his character and his eventual decision to return and face Scar (who has ruined the Pridelands in the interim) is much more meaningful.  Simba's hilarious misadventures with Timon and Pumbaa had me laughing all the way to Simba's reunion with Nala.<br />The music is good and compliments the movie well.  However, the new musical number, &quot;Morning Report&quot;, does not seem to be well placed in the story, and, although it does make sense in the whole story, it almost distracts a person from the real reasons to watch.  This movie has a great story that was partially responsible for the revival of Disney movies in the present era.  Disney did us a favor by including both versions of the film - the newly &quot;restored&quot; original and the &quot;Special Edition&quot; which includes the new song, so you can watch both and decide for yourself which is better.<br />The moral of &quot;wanting to escape from reality might be fun for a while, but your responsibilities eventually catch up with you&quot; is well stated, but not shoved down your throat.  Scar is a wonderful villain.  Watching him set up the hyenas to goosestep in huge battalions in front of him was a little chilling.  The eventual fate of Scar was even more chilling.  I can actually see where some children might be remembering the death of Mufasa and/or Scar even more vividly than the death of Bambi's mother.<br />This Platinum edition DVD presents all of the extra material that DVD fans have come to want, and kids have come to love.  This 2 disc collection is much richer than the original release.  Many bonus features, including a cool &quot;virtual safari&quot; game you can play on your home DVD player without any extra controls make this edition a better value than the original DVD.  The two extra music videos are fun, and the usual sing-along track had my daughter trying to sing along just as expected.<br />The Lion King will be one of the Kings of Disney DVD for a long time to come.lain.

0385504209|5.0|I was already digging the book before I got to the really good bits around page 230 - then I had to stay up an extra two hours to read the next 120 pages or so because I was mesmerized.<br />The claims made in the book are a dagger in the back of Christian doctrine, and a condemnation of the Catholic church basically, and I expect there's many a review of this book giving it 0 stars, simply because people are angry that their faith is being questioned by someone else, God forbid. *buh-duh-bump*<br />Anyway, don't listen to those reviewers.  If you can keep an open mind about the whole thing, whether you believe the information contained within to be fact or fiction, you're going to greatly enjoy this book.
B00005QENZ|3.0|Six years after Aerosmith's late 80s comeback Aerosmith entered the studio once again. The sessions were troubled by a lack of creativity and many guest song writers were brought in to help. The first version of the album was rejected by Geffen execs and the band hit the studio again. They emerged with a very glossy album that would become their biggest seller. The album itself is really only average by Aerosmith standards. The album just lacks punch like Pump or Rocks. This album was marketed really well driven by the &quot;trilogy&quot;. The videos for Cryin, Amazin, &amp; Crazy were well done and stole the show. The rest of the album while not exactly filler, just isn't as good as the 5 hit singles. Overall it is a good listen and you should get it even if it is only average.<br />1. Intro. Just like it says a noisy intro.<br />2. Eat the Rich. 10/10 First single and most hardrocking on the album. Great guitars on this one.<br />3. Get a Grip. 7/10 I like the drum intro even though it sounds like you're in an aerobics class. The lyrics and Guitars just aren't up to snuf on this one.<br />4. Fever. 7/10 Fast song, but doesn't have that Aerosmith magic.<br />5. Living on the Edge. 10/10 2nd single from the album. Really great song with a pounding, driving drum beat. Many knock the social/political commentary lyrics by Steven Tyler but I like them. Great guitar solo too.<br />6. Flesh. 7/10 Another let down after the great song before.<br />7. Walk on Down. 7/10 Musically this song isn't that bad, it has a nice blues feel. But I don't like Joe Perry's singing.<br />8. Shut &amp; Dance. 6/10 This is a weak song. The music &amp; lyrics just aren't very good.<br />9. Cryin. 10/10 3rd single and really good song about relationships. Great video too if you see it.<br />10. Gotta Love it. 8/10 This is pretty good. Has a nice groove.<br />11. Crazy. 9/10 5th single from this album. I loved it when it came out but then hated it when it got overexposed. I would skip this track until 2002 I hated it so much. Finally I listened to it and could enjoy it again.<br />12. Lineup. 8/10 Pretty good song but nothing special about it.<br />13. Amazing. 10/10 The 4th hit single starts as a soft ballad and builds and builds. Great guitar solos to end the song.<br />14. Boogieman. Short little guitar instrumental.<br />If you are a hardcore fan then you know you should have this one. If you just want the hits get Big Ones or some of their other new greatest hits CDs. Remember even an average Aerosmith album is better than most other bands best stuff.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones' biggest accomplishment resides in her ability to blend musical styles in a way that is mindboggling. Her songs, depending on &quot;where you come from&quot; might sound as anything ranging from Jazz, to Country to pop. The album as a whole has songs that outweigh the over-promoted &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; and &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; in many ways, such as the closing track, &quot;The Nearness of You&quot;.<br />'Come Away with Me' (the album) conveys the work of a veteran producer (Arif Mardin, responsible of landmark recordings by Aretha Franklin, Dusty Springfield, Roberta Flack, and Willie Nelson, among others) with his artist in front of the mic and playing piano, accompanied by a load of talented session musicians, in an effort to establish her as a ruler within a specific segment. In trying to do that, they've succeeded in my book.<br />As young an artist as she is, she has many years ahead of her to continue to bring out all her musical talent and background. As a side trivia piece, Norah is the daughter of legend Ravi Shankar, the sitar virtuoso who influenced The Beatles, among many other musicians of the 20th and 21st century, so it's no surprise that she's got the talent she's shown so far: it runs in her veins.
B0000CAQ27|4.0|This album is awsome.  Although It's not as good as Missundaztood, it's still better than Can't Take Me Home.  She did a great job.  The best songs on the album would have had to have been, Trouble, God is a DJ, Catch Me While I'm Sleeping, and Save My Life.  They were the greatest.  The only song I didn't like was Hooker.  There was just no reason for that song to be on there.  She used the F word too much.  But I highly recommend this CD!  The only thig is, get the edited verion if you are younger.
B000069AUI|5.0|With a sound that many compare to Radiohead, Travis, Doves, The Verve and even the Pink Floyd, this UK band came back in 2002 with an album more mature and accomplished than their debut smash hit album, &quot;Parachute,&quot; which earned them a Grammy for best alternative act, among many other accolades in 2000 and 2001. The truth is that Coldplay has an unmistakable &quot;sound&quot; largely due to Chris Martin's voice sitting in the middle of a pool of sounds that are able to soothe the listener while simultaneously provoking audatious thoughts about things such as fair trade (&quot;Politik&quot;), life (&quot;Daylight&quot;) and the afterlife (&quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot;), along with images of love (&quot;Green Eyes&quot;) and breakups (&quot;The Scientist&quot;). So many powerful bits here and there make this album a true jewel.<br />The album opens up with a lot of strength: a guitar riff that breaks the silence of two years; and closes with a melancholic theme that is close to the point of genius, with Martin at the piano. My favorite songs... well, it's really hard to tell, since the entire album is a great piece of work, but if you point a gun at me and make me choose, I'd pick &quot;The Scientist&quot; (reminds me of the time when our team broke up at another job -we were one darn good IT Team back there!), the heavenly sounds from &quot;Clocks&quot; and the title track. These guys have only just &quot;begun&quot; -if Chris Martin is not another rock star-to-go-astray, we will have a lot more great music to expect from these guys in the years to come.

B0000TB050|1.0|My son brought this home and put it on the 6.1 Surround system. I asked if &quot;BAD&quot; (You know, the song that 'made' U2?) was on the set list. He said: &quot;no&quot;, I said: &quot;Turn it off, take it out and throw it away.&quot; I don't want to see or hear anymore of Bono's egotistical jive. Either you ROCK in my house, or you're outta here! And this time...Thumbs down on this &quot;loser&quot; Concert DVD. Pure sell-out garbage. Go away U2. Quit taking up other people's air!
B00000JBFW|5.0|This 1984 release--one of the most anticipated of that year, eventually going platinum--saw Deep Purple's most successful line-up in a somewhat tentative reunion, fortunately bowing to pressure from their public to record and tour again. The first (and best) document of Purple's 80s reunion era, \\"Perfect Strangers\\" is a thrilling album, one of the supergroup's finest. The compositional output of Roger Glover, Ritchie Blackmore, and Ian Gillan is rough and gutsy, while remaining mystic and intriguing.<br />The near lack of sincerity of Deep Purple's reunited friendship is showcased in the hard-hitting, gripping songs, such as the agressive 'Under the Gun,' 'A Gypsy's Kiss,' and the anti-preachy 'Nobody's Home,' as the shaky reunion is captured more sympathetically on the ominous title cut. 'Hungry Daze' and 'Wasted Sunsets' are a gaze back at Purple's fast-living days past (one full of fury, the other longing and lonesome), and 'Knocking At Your Back Door' gave the group a smash hit single. 'Son Of Alerik' is a bonus track for this remaster, a driven and alluring studio jam.<br />The sound of the musicianship on this album could not be immitated; Blackmore's trademark guitar is facinating, Glover's bass reaches brilliant madness, Gillan's barbed wire voice soars, as Jon Lord's organ is a highlight as usual, and drummer Ian Paice remains out of his head. This album is a landmark for Deep Purple, and is aptly titled--the band was reunited only by pressure from their public, making them no longer musical mates, but \\"Perfect Strangers.\\" Not withstanding, the group were not strangers at all when it came to their common goal of making music.
B000002WYT|5.0|I have pretty much every dmb CD and this one is probably the one I play the most.  If you liked &quot;under the table and dreaming&quot; that I would defintely get this one.   If you like any of dmb's &quot;new stuff&quot; you probably won't like this cd...this is one of those cds you either like or you don't.  dmb is by far one of the most talented bands out there right now and this cd seems to show off all of it at once.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Relationship of command is by far one of the best cd's i own. There is something about it that i love. I bought it 3 years ago and it is still in my cd player at least once a day. if you buy it you wont be dissapointed.
B000002GOZ|5.0|I bought this cd 2 days after seeing his concert and i really enjoyed it.  The summer of 69 is really good cuz its not as upbeat as the original, and i like the acoustic sound.  Also, the musicians in the background are amazing, its a great cd, but i would also suggest buying his other cds to get the full rock sound, but great cd.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Even though I've only heard half the album like:<BR>1: Me Against The Music (8/10)* This song is the best it's really cool and the video is as cool as Madonna being in this song as well!<br />2: Boom, Boom (Featuring The Ying Yang Twins) 8/10 <BR>I heard this song on television when Britney did a In The Zone special. This song was was awesome too! The Ying Yang twins made it cool as well. It's like a club song sorta.<br />3: Showdown (7/10) This song is really cool for a kinda slow song. I heard this on a full listening AOL Party. This song is really good.<br />4: Breathe On Me (10/10) I love this song it has a feel like Kylie Minogue. This song is great and Britney performed it very well on The In The Zone special on Television (one of my favorite songs on the album)<br />5: Early Mournin' (4/10) This song is supposedly one I dislike and it was produced with Moby. I don't like Moby either so that's why i don't really like this song. The beats are boring and I just don't like the song!<br />6: Toxic (10/10) This is my all time favorite song ever! This song is unexplaniable. The beats are awesome to me. It was as awesome as the 2002 Britney Spears Pepsi Commercial song. I know I will listen to this song the most! Britney did some awesome dance moves on this one on In The Zone special!<br />I just mostly listened to these songs. I'll hear the rest of the album when i buy it on November 20th, 2003. This is a cd a Britney Fan should own. I haven't even heard the whole album and it's great so far even though i've only listened to half!
0385512104|4.0|I, like many of the other reviewers, am the parent of an unusual child.  My son has licked doormats in department stores and is fascinated by taxidermy.  At six, he still can't read social cues as well as his younger sister and will respond to stimuli inconsistently.  He's not Christopher but he's not like anyone else either.  <br />So, it was with great enthusiasm that I approached this short novel and what I found was an insight into the experience of living that life.  I am often so busy &quot;managing&quot; my son or being embarrassed or frustrated by him that I forget how weird everything seems  to him.  I think Mark Haddon did an incredible job of illustrating both the chaos that surrounds Chistopher as well as the chaos that Christopher perceives is around him.  His behavior is merely an effort to control all the information he receives and cannot process.  SO, he eats foods of a certain color and watches the patterns of passing cars in order to make his life orderly.  However, he has no real engagement with the factors that make his parents lives disorderly.  He does not understand ambivalence , embarrassment or spite only fear and joy.<br />Fictional representations of autism and its attendant disorders often try to make the condition a blessing in disguise and the characters so affected become angels or messengers.  What Mark Haddon reminds us is that their worlds intersect with ours in something other than sweet little circles.  This novel shows the reader everything that Christopher experiences and yet is able to convey to us that Christopher can't respond to these experiences in the way all of those around him regularly do.  In fact, what Haddon does is show us how bizarre we are when the tidal wave of our daily lives is stripped of the aggression, ambition and exhaustion that fuel us.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This has to be her best album yet. The songs are off the Hook. The Beats are amazing and the vocals are pure amazement. That's why it's flying off the shelfs. Britney converts us into her new style. The album is extravagant, and it's filled with joy, heartbreak, ballads, love songs, sensuality, sexuality it's an amazing album. Go pick It Up!
B0000T6JH4|5.0|The band has been apart for over 30 years, but the music lives on and this release shows what they were like in the studio, organic, just like their Hamburg days.   As much as the strings sounded nice on the original Let It Be from 1970, it wasn't what Macca wanted and now you have the real deal...After all, it is Christmas, and what would it be like without a new Beatles album under the tree...
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Another Masterpiece! I am so happy to be listening to music that means something again. Sure there are a couple great new artist of this new era, but who? Norah Jones? What happened to simplicity and brilliance in a song? Sarah's new album makes you think again, makes you feel again! I wish other artist of the Lillith Fair would have transcended, but Artist like Jewel have sold their soul instead of saving them! I would love to see someone like Sarah in the spotlight again, our daughters need someone like her. Instead they have Brittney &quot;No talent&quot; Spears! No more force feeding of garbage! Songs like &quot;Drifting&quot; is up lifting! If you love Sarah or want real music get this album. You deserves it, the world deserves it! Oh, Sarah if you are reading, Lillith needs to come back!
B0000DJE9R|5.0|No,it is not a new a cd but all the songs on it sounds great. The new one 'One More Chance' is a taste of what Jackson has in store for his fans in the future. All of these songs have all the wannbe bubblegum pop stars these days trying to achieve. Michael has done it for over thirty years now and please give him 'one more chance' to let him rock your world. Long live the 'KING OF POP'
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I agree with what many have included in their write ups.  The sound is a bit compressed.  But I have more to add.<br />Okay, I decided to buy it last night. <br />Impressions...<br />Get Back, Two Of Us, I've Got A Feeling, One After 909, Don't Let Me Down (From Hey Jude vinyl or Past Masters II CD) and I Me Mine: Not much has changed except it is a better quality mix. I expected the refrain and the ending of Get Back, and as it is now is just too abrupt. It would have been better with the refrain and the talking at the end.  As a whole the remastering is an improvement and the piano and organ mix is much better. The old master was generally much muddier.<br />For You Blue. This is where I really noticed the remastering job. To me, hearing this remaster makes it all worthwhile laying out the cash to buy this record.<br />The Long and Winding Road. Benefits from the removal of the Phil Spector wall of sound. Plus you can hear the vocals clearly and the piano is clean and bright.<br />Across The Universe: Much like the Past Masters II version with the bird sounds removed. The remastering job has cleaned up the mix and the guitar is much cleaner.<br />Let It Be. I don't know about this one. Although the Phil Spector version was muddier, I believe it benefited from the change in the electric guitar, the chorus and orchestration. It seemed to allow the song to build to a crescendo and it had more punch. It is missing on this song now. Sure the remastering job is better, but the guitar from the single version is not nearly as dynamic. The old version from Let It Be had an anthemic quality that is lacking from this version. <br />My two Cents: Again, call the album Get Back because it would represent the idea of going back and releasing the songs as they were originally recorded. Also, add Dig It and some of the other songs that were included in the recording sessions. <br />Now that Let It Be has been remastered, maybe we can have the other LP's remastered and Past Masters remastered as well. Quite frankly, George Martin didn't always do a great job of mastering the recordings either. I know Phil Spector mucked up two songs from Let It Be and arguably did a better job on the song Let It Be. Many of the old Beatles songs were recorded in Mono and would benefit from a remastering of the original mono tapes. The open sound of feeling like you are in the room when they were recording the songs would come out of the mix.  George Martin had Ringo play the symbols too much to preserve the high end on records after repeated plays. These need to be mixed down a little.<br />Other observations. We were living in Europe at the time Let It Be was released and my brother picked up the box version with the booklet of all the original pictures (still has it). Sure many are reproduced, but they include writing covering part of the pictures.<br />As a whole I am glad I bought it and I would recommend it for others. Just wish Paul would have insisted the reissue include more songs from the original sessions. As anyone can attest who own them, there are some import bootlegs of Beatles on CD from the original outakes of sessions that put the Beatles Anthology and Past Masters to shame. Also the same for the Rolling Stones that include Mono versions of all their old songs through the Beggars Banquet sessions and you can really feel like you are in the room listening to them play. Stray Cat Blues on mono has some increadible guitar. Since I have only heard some of these and don't own them, I will start my search for them now.<br />Oh well, if you are lucky enough to have those digipacks from Europe, you are a lucky man (woman).
