B00CX7TOOG|1|I love the two main actors, but this was a real snorer. John Travolta playing a foreigner was terrible. 98% of the movie was Travolta talking, talking, talking and talking. The only action was what you see in the trailer (which is minimum). At the end of the movie when he was on his knees telling de niro to kill him. I can guarantee in the theater the audience was yelling \\"kill him\\" just to shut him up.  I know that is what I was thinking.Not worth seeing and definitely not worth buying- unless you have had problems sleeping- this movie will cure that.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This is like the best game ever! It's so fun and funny too! Also it keeps you and others entertained! =) I would definitely but a second one! Like minion rush 2 using stuff form despicable me 2! SO fun me and my aunt both LOVE minions!! 1000000000000000000 thumbs up!!! =D &lt;33333333333333
B000TXZVGQ|5|I am so glad this is finally out (again) on DVD. This is, hands down, one of the best shows ever made. The extras a great too.
B000KCHZK6|5|Norah Jones' sultry voice come through once again with a winner.
B000HC2LI0|5|beautiful box and well organized, this series is just as I remember.Great writing and fabulous acting. It's great to have these episodes to watch and share with others.
B00APJLFEG|5|We just loved this movie, I highly recommend for the family
B00BD99JMW|2|I was disappointed in this book and story. I felt it was just more of the same from the first two books but in a different setting. I also got really tired of all the relationship drama. I was also disappointed the author had a sixteen year old teenager have sex with her boyfriend. I think that sends the wrong message to our youth, and It was not necessary for the story.
B00A2AHU2E|5|Oldie but really good
B008AK8FHM|4|I saw the author during a TV interview.  He impressed me with his sincerity so I just had to get the book. I purchased the Kindle edition for my PC.  I am glad to have read it.  It is a story that jives with many other experiences that most people don't know whether to believe or not.  But there is one thing that makes this experience special. The author is a neurosurgeon who did not believe in life after death.  With his knowledge and training, it just could not be possible--until he had a verified brain condition that could not have allowed him to have the experience he did.  It is not a long read but still compelling and thought-provoking.
B00005JMEW|2|A vengeful bride, a murky assasination plot and lots of violence and gore are the key elements in this Quentin Tarantino movie. As ususal, he tells the story in a series of plots which relate to a larger theme. The problem is that at times the plots are not in sequence. This leads to some confusion on the part of the audience. Combine this with the undeveloped background of the characters and the audience is left with too many questions. There is a humorous element in the premise of a bride (unnamed) who is exacting revenge with a Katana sword, sort of like Bride Magazine meets Highlander, but overall it is a silly unbelievable plot with little redeeming value. Some good sword techniques if you are into the Martial Arts though. I understand Volume 2 will be out soon and will explain some of the things which were left out in this version of the story. Maybe someone who sees it will fill me in.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I was recommended this book by a friend and I completely loved it! It is a great book to read and it keeps you wanting more all the time. I was hoping it would never end, that's how much I enjoyed The Fault in Our Stars. Definitely a sad story, but you get attached to the characters very quickly and want to know what's going to happen to them next.
B00BAXFECK|4|Great character development in a richly complex story.
B00FG26UEC|4|Building a world to make Robert Jordan proud and laying the ground for a epic good versus evil clash, this story guides us to a world with the battle lines blurred and a question mark over the allegience of men, where they must decide whether they are willing to give there all for life itself. Brilliant read, enticing and complex yet intelligent in the hidden secrets throughout the story of a far bigger picture to come, a stepping stone in a story that will captivate us for years to come
B004EBZX6W|1|I don't believe the added information or graphs that you get with this product is any more useful than the Wi-Fi information I already have on my kindle product.
B005EGXTHG|5|Loved this and I'm not a teenager - I'm 40!  Couldn't put it down ... loved all three books.  After reading the first in the series, I immediately downloaded the remaining two in the trilogy.  Thrilling, emotional, thought provoking.
B00BFUUMO8|5|sweet
B00000IB4D|5|This is the first Santana album after Carlos got into his religious/mystic stage.  It is quite a departure from other material by the &quot;group&quot;, although Carlos does have a number of solo albums along  the same lines.  It is more of a jazz fusion than the traditional latin  beat.  There is a duet with John McLaughlin and a cover of a Herbie Hancock  number.  There are also three excellent jazz flavored songs.  Fans of the  more traditional Santana music might not appreciate this experimentation  into jazz, while the jazz fusion fans might not appreciate the latin  rhythms. I found it to be an excellent merger of the two styles.
B0071XO8RA|4|Couldn't put this book down! i felt a great mix of emotions reading this series ; dread, sorrow, depression, and just the right inkling of hope that pushes you to the end in a furious reading frenzy . i only gave it 4 stars because the writing just seemed slightly off sometimes kind of amateurish, but i feel pretty bad about that. I really want to give it like 4 and a half stars.
1416955070|4|I'm not going to go into detail by typing it out, but here are a few of my points I mention in the video. :)<br /><br />-Love the characters! Every one of them! I'm definitely team Jace though. :) Gotta love the bad boys!<br />-The whole world seems very intriguing. I wouldn't mind being a shadowhunter.<br />-I love when an author can put all the paranormal creatures in the book like: Vampires, Werewolves, Fairies (Fair people as they're called in this book. I'm not a fan of that.) Demons.<br />-Clary and Jace's comentary and sarcasm towards each other. I love when a book can make you laugh at loud.<br />-The diversity of the characters in the book. If you've read it you know what I mean.<br />-It will make a good movie I think.<br /><br />-I will admit it had it's moments when it seemed like other books. (I hate saying that because I don't like comparing books but it's true in a way) It does stand out on it's own though.
B005K17RU0|5|Very good app
B00DJFIMW6|5|I love that it has costumes in it but I wish it had different minions you could use like Kevin!!!
B00IJJUIMY|4|Good read-prepped me for the next one.
B00DVKOYBM|5|Great game really addictive
B00CHCUR9I|5|I loved it if you like zombie books and comic books.you would also love this book.poo<br /><br />This was awesome!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /> oh yeah that's what I'm talking about<br />free download and install it on your phone<br />I know you'd like it when you have it
B004IK30S2|5|I can't wait for the sequel. You Have to watch it multiple times to really enjoy huge cast of characters. .
B004KPX4W2|4|While I was glad that I had rented this from Amazon instead of paying movie theater prices, I found myself really enjoying this movie. The cast is great, and there's a great mix of comedy and things exploding. This movie is worth renting and seeing, at least once.
B00ADYYY50|3|The beats were good but this is an album you listen to while and after getting high. As a matter of fact, I think he was high the entire time he was recording.
B00FN811SY|5|I can read my bible and get all the ifo i need and it was free and just what i needed thanks [...]  for letting me get this in to my app.
B00N6PD3GE|5|Excellent history
0307341550|5|Dark, raw, gritty and fantastic!  I loved how real this book was. I'll definitely buy more of Gillian Flynn's books.
B0009A1AS2|5|After having just listened to this album, I can surely say that any and all Dream Theater fans will not be dissapointed. The title song \\"Octavarium\\" is, although slow at first, a very good song with strong emotion. It speeds up after a couple minutes and turns it an awsome song. The other songs are also sure to please, and I'm sure all who buy it, when released will be pleased.
B000SEGTI0|5|After a few recent misses with either classic science fiction (The Foundation Trilogy) or more recent and highly loved work of the same genre (_The Diamond Age_, _Snow Crash_).  I took up this book.  I took it up because the only other Dick I read I didn't really like  -- but it was the alternate history _The Man in the High Castle_, not a work of science fiction.<br /><br />I had begun to think that I didn't like science fiction, I just really liked Kurt Vonnegut.  I picked up the Dick once more because my fellow Chicagoan deserved a second chance.<br /><br />I am glad I did.<br /><br />This book's storyline may be in the national conscious because of the fourteen different versions of _Blade Runner_ drift in the ether.  You can see the influence, but this isn't _Blade Runner_.  I'm stuck trying to say if one was better than the other, so I will just hedge and say that both creations have their merit.  Dick draws great characters to go with the world he creates, a big plus for me because I want to see both the world and the effects this world has on the people.  Aside from a few relics of the time he was writing -- widespread tobacco use, patriarchal gender relations -- the world is thoroughly modern.  And the kicker, modern but not over-explained.  I fit in, and I liked it.<br /><br />Buy this book; read this book.
B00005JKJA|3|Left-brained, analytical people should not watch this movie.  My head hurt after leaving the theatre trying to figure everything out.  Made me laugh the more I thought about the movie afterward.  I would like to know where she got her brand of lipstick that stayed on so perfectly (even in the shower) throughout the entire movie.
B00CWY76CC|5|Love it
0061673730|3|I started reading the book but lost interest as it dealt with a trip across Northern USA.  I was not expecting this and need to find more time to see if it really shows or deals with the values of life.
B003EVFHYG|5|I've had \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" for over a year now and I still love the music as much as when I first bought it. I thought that after a while I'd get used to the songs and they wouldn't seem quite as awesome anymore but even now they still give me chills down my spine. Definitely the best album I've ever listened to. I love it!
B00003CXDG|4|I saw this movie in theaters the first day it came out.  It was a little slow in the middle, but had some great action sceanes at the end.   I'm glad they are putting the Metallica , I Dissapear video on the DVD, but why arn't they putting the Limp Bizkit Take a Look Around(MI-2 Theme) on it.  I just watched the Take a look around video and thought it is so much cooler than the I dissappear video. If they included the Limp Bizkit video, this would get 5 stars.
006178480X|5|Wow! James Rollins continues to deliver novel after novel that engages the imagination, excites the mind, and delivers a story that keeps the reader turning page after page as quickly as possible, The Eye of God is another winner for Rollins.<br /><br />&#34;Commander Gray Pierce and Sigma Force set out to discover a truth tied to the fall of the Roman Empire, to a mystery going back to the birth of Christianity, and to a weapon hidden for centuries that holds the fate of humanity.&#34;<br /><br />Oh yeah, that's all. Nothing big, just the fate of humanity and all that. Page turner, action packed, and another great addition to my home library.
0446576220|4|After reading this book I must say I thought it to be a great read. I am a student at the University of Baltimore enrolled in an entrepreneurship course, and this book was an assigned reading. In this book Tony Hsieh went into great detail about his personal theory of “happiness” and how one could use the 'science of happiness' and apply it to change one's career and life. Tony also discussed the struggles he had as an entrepreneur and his vision for Zappos. One thing that I really liked about this book is that it showed the true struggles and downfalls that an entrepreneur faces, but it also showed what you need to do to overcome those struggles. I personally love everything about this book, there wasn’t anything that I disliked. This book would be very useful to other entrepreneurship students because it outlines the steps you must take in order to start a successful business and it also tells you the mentality that one must have. My favor quote from the book is “I thought about how easily we are all brainwashed by our society and culture to stop thinking and just assume by default that more money equals more success and more happiness, when ultimately happiness is really just about enjoying life”. This is my favor quote because a lot of people are chasing a false sense of happiness without even knowing what true happiness is. I would definitely recommend this book to other readers.
B000X2H8G4|4|I really like this. I use it when watching TV. It helps with all sound but is very good for hearing accents on BBC and Downton Abbey.
B002361MLA|5|An eye opener for the path to spiritual awakening!

B00DEG4Z1W|5|My grand kids said  they loves this game, and play it a lot JJ.  So they will keep it until they get bored.
B00275EGWY|5|This was a movie about a maverick adrenalin junkie working in a bomb disposal unit in Iraq.  At the point we're seeing this guy, he's straying more and more from the rules until he gets himself and the others with him in trouble.  The acting in it was excellent, the filming and pacing was to the point, and the directing was tight.  Bigelow's vision was apparent all the way through this, and she gave us a solid picture.  She makes those of us who haven't experienced it feel the tension and heat and insanity of the situation that everyone over there is having to deal with every day.    This isn't a documentary.  It's fiction about someone pushing the rules to get his rush in a tense situation.  And as such, it's well told and a great movie.
1592400876|4|This book is wonderfully written and mixes humor with fact in such a way that it is a pleasure to read and learn the things about punctuation you SHOULD have been taught when you were at school. This is an interesting way to learn some of the history behind punctuation and highlights just how much we miss during the essential, early school years. I highly recommend this book to any one with a sense of humor and a love of learning.
B00JKGYSAI|5|ANOTHER GREAT VOICE THAT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE AND YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS CD!
0345495004|5|Loving Frank is a novel about a woman, rather than a novel about a famous man and his lover. The entire novel illustrates Mamah's view of her relationship to Frank Lloyd Wright. Should she leave with her lover? Did she abandon her children? Will her sister forgive her? Should she doubt herself when Ellen Key, the philosopher changes course? Should she stay with such a flawed man? How to win her children back?     I'm tired of stories told about the lovers and wives of famous men. Most of them portray the importance of the woman to the man and his career. They go on about  how the men gained by their lover's support, then cheated on them,  but the woman will always love them because she can't help it. In the course of stories about famous men the women important to them so often turn out to be fawning empty vessels.    I only started this book, because it was required of my book club. So I was so relieved to find that from the beginning it is a story about Mamah. Her relationship with Wright is compounded by his amazing and compelling personality and talent, but they do not make her into a hollow character.    So read away at this great story of a woman in love. And thank you to Nancy Horan for bringing Mamah to life.
B00280LYHS|5|This is one of the best series I've ever read. Now onto heroes of olympus. Mr. Riordan, keep on writing.
0756404746|5|The Name of the Wind is without a doubt the best-written book I have read in a very long time. Patrick Rothfuss chooses words that would never occur to other writers to use, yet fit his purpose perfectly. I would read these books just for the writing–but Rothfuss delivers a compelling story on top of his fantastic writing. I could not put this book down, and even when the plot was slow, I was enthralled in the book's events and Kvothe's many misadventures. The magic of the world is not contrived, nor is it distracting to the overall story. Everything about this book flows smoothly together to create an amazing tale. 10/10 would recommend this and the sequel.
B002HJ9PTO|4|Good easy to use product with good value!
B0009XNUK0|3|All the positive reviews here have neglected to comment on one thing, and that is the songs on this collection are not the full length versions. Rather they are the edits for radio versions. I prefer the original full length songs that come from the respective albums so prefer HIStory to this.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|Amazing read. I couldn't put it down! You grow to care about all the characters and what happens to them. I look forward to more from this author.
B009AMANBA|5|Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed Lincoln better than any other actor I have ever seen. The movie gave a better insight of Lincoln than any other.
B003O86FMW|5|This book was amazing. I have just finished reading it for the eighth time and i never get tired of reading it!!! I highly recommend reading Catching Fire and the whole Hunger games series. Thank you so much Suzanne Collins for creating these amazing books and i can't wait for all of the movies to come out
B007SGLZP8|5|this book really keeps you going and the ending is great the way it all<br />played out--excellent-I highly reccemend it

0975991477|5|I was thrilled to read this book. Why? Finally, so much of my own experience in this life begins to make sense when it comes to energy. When I was a child, I noticed that in my large family, each person perceived the \\"same\\" experience in a different way. One family, several different realities. Perception seems to be guided by energy, emotion, experience.... Lipton describes quite well how a thought can push energy in a direction that validates one's belief. Sadly, that validation can focus on Mis-information as easily as it can focus on the truth.  I have to agree that not all Scientist are great writers, and I keep this in mind when I read this book. I've been careful not to let certain phrases throw me off the beautiful path that this book delicately offers to the reader.
0553573411|2|I loved the plot.  The concept is excellent, the writing is okay, but the story, in particular the character interaction, leaves much to be desired.  I finished it because I wanted to know what happened to the characters, so obviously there's some worth to it.  But I really had to force myself to finish the book, and only my interest in the outcome kept me going.  I'm not sure what's wrong with it.  The characters are interesting, not two dimensional, but they simply couldn't hold my interest.
B0063IH60K|5|Love it !!

B002JTHFUS|5|I will first start out with saying that I was just turning a mere four years young when this album first debuted in Oct. of 1984, but even then the classic song 'The Unforgettable Fire' resonated through my head, capturing me in its swirling carnival of colors. It would in fact define what I considered 80's music, which is, in a sense, what the Unforgettable Fire is for U2, their most 80's sounding album. It wasn't until much later (2001 to be exact) that I knew whom it was this song belonged to, that I've since have been trying to emulate with my own music.<br /><br />With U2's previous works they had shaped their sound, dynamics, and stage shows. As one can hear on the later half of the war album (excluding 40, a most beautiful song), however, this sound was becoming limited, and unable to quench the thirst of U2's ever yearning growth. It seemed in fact they couldn't- or shouldn't- sing that song again. In order to explore new sonic arenas they turned to Brian Eno, who brought along his good friend and fellow co-worker Daniel Lanois (both of whom's workings I was aware of long before I was of U2). Through them, and the absence of the dreary studio environment, ideas began to form, and songs became more than songs, but landscapes of sounds, or soundscapes. Orderliness was juxtaposed with random, raw, emotional, gut driven playing and singing.<br /><br />What we got from that is the Unforgettable Fire. A mix of pure pop genius, architectured poetry of both music and words, and the feeling of suspended free fall. Most of this is endured by Eno's love for flawed, raw takes, and in-completed ideas. So much so that the most popular song, and radio friendly of the bunch, 'Pride', sounds almost out of placed with its well crafted sound. This is not to say there was no deliberateness on U2s part. If this new remastering does anything, it brings out the wonderfully crafted sound that U2 brings to the album. This in no way sounds like a band with whom in 83 (a year and 8 months earlier), put out the raw sound of rock/punk that was War. Maybe it wouldn't be their most well crafted of attempts to refurbish themselves, but it would definitely lay the ground works for future endeavors such as The Joshua Tree (the newly re-hashed 'Disappearing Act' (featured on the bonus audio CD) is fairly safe to say the start of what would become 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm looking For'), Achtung Baby and even their newest No Line On the Horizon, which touches upon the Unforgettable Fire regularly (ie Fez-Being Born).<br /><br />So is it worth revisiting this album, in which would corner stone U2's career? (Live Aid would have meant nothing if 'Bad' had not been written.) The answer is an unquestionable yes. This newly remastered album brings to life the layers of sound interwoven amongst the cinematic pictures that these songs create. The bonus material is great, and it's wonderful to see the small barren stages of U2's earlier career, and thus putting more importance on the songs and the performances to sell the audience. It is also wonderful to see the 80's style they paraded, and to have some music videos from the era, as it is still beyond me why the 1980-1990 collection of videos has yet to be put on DVD.<br /><br />So a five star rating to the album that, to me, defined the 80's, and in a 'leap', defined the career of what we now know U2 is, simply unforgettable!put out the raw sound of rock/punk that was War.

0439023491|4|I spent months cheering for Katniss and Peetah in their victory of The Hunger Games, but before all the ticker tape in my house was cleaned up along came Catching Fire and the capitol yanked my happiness right out from under me. I will not go into detail, as I would have hated someone to spoil this delicious book for me, but I will say it is as unputdownable as the original. My son and I have had long discussions about these books and now my daughter--who only reads because her teachers enforce it--is hooked and babbling on and on about Katniss, Peetah, Gale, and why on earth the Capitol would do such things. The only downfall to finishing Catching Fire, is the long wait until the 3rd book arrives. Truly a MUST read!<br />--Reviewed By Kerry O'Malley Cerra
1451666179|5|I've only read a few &#34;chapters&#34; of this book, but I am in love with it.  It is so funny.  The illustrations are hilariously simple and the sentiments are so easy to relate to.  The book is great as you don't have to sit down and read the whole thing.  It is like as book of short stories.  It is very simply and casually written and really feels like Allie is just having a friendly, and entertainingly illustrated, conversation with the reader.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading the rest of the stories in this book.
B00A83075M|3|I bought it cause of my kids and I too thought it would be a really good movie but it a three star movie and kids under 3 will get bord with it about 1/3 of the way to half way into the movie. Other then that its not bad.

B004RC8NUQ|5|This has got to be one of the best romantic comedies I've seen, along with The Ugly Truth (Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler. Natalie Portman is a great comediene as well as being a great serious actor (Black Swan). There's great chemistry with Ashton Kutcher, who also does great comedic work. A little on the \\"racy\\" side, and stretch of the imagination, the plot has these two as friends with \\"priviledges\\" who eventually fall in love. Lots of laughs and human little twists in the plot that are straight out of true life as most of us have experienced it. Loved it. Buy it. It's a keeper.
B00JJHDX9A|4|Had to watch the next installment.  Amazon delivery great, movie could have used some help.  Not bad but not one of the betters.
B009RX85N0|5|I like this show but sometimes miss an episode.  When it first came out as a pre-sale, the price was higher than I wanted to pay.  So, I waited.  Finally, the price came down to what I consider reasonable (under $20).  Bought it.  The quality is great.  No complaints.  I loved the bonus parts, too, especially the blooper section.
6305313687|5|First of all Edward Norton delivers an absolutely incredible performance along with all the supporting actors. This is trully one of the best films I have ever seen. This film depicts how young, confused teens(or people of any age for that matter) of any race can be sucked into racism. The film also does a good job of showing how racism is narrow minded and just not worth it.  <br /> <br />I highly recomend buying this film and showing it to anyone who is willing to watch it and able to understand it. I bought this film without seeing beforehand and I love it and i'm thrilled with my decision to buy it.
B004EF8AJA|5|As a fan of Brirish period film, I typically watch upper society films. This was a welcomed surprise as I learned ability the North vs South diversity in Britain. It was a visual treat even with the dark environment of the cotton mill. Well done .
B001NFNFIK|5|then, take it from there!  I LOVED the movie and Tommy Lee as well.  I surely will need to watch it again and again to pick up even more of what the author was trying to relate. There are secrets inside the folds of this movie that I wonder if the book unravels.  I will have to get that as well..............!  :)  I honestly belive we do bring in unfinshed business from the past.  But, how far  back?  And, we must also finish undone business........... This moive has kept me thinking all day on mine.......Happy moive watching :)
B000YMM3CC|5|I would recommend this movie to an romantic personality.  the transition from the past to the present with James Garner and  Miss Rowlands was very well done.
B000002A46|5|I had this CD before but I couldn't find it so I purchased it thru you . Love it always.<br /><br />Thanks!!!
B00PRX8UBG|1|It's an exciting film, no doubt, and with very good performances. But what a terrible message. I was actually elated at one point because I thought, \\"For once the teacher isn't the hero! He's going to be exposed for the sociopath he clearly is!\\" But alas, another hope crushed.    This is so typically American. Everything, it would seem - even the ethereal art form of jazz - can be reduced to a Hollywood cliché. Music teacher as drill sergeant... Hollywood loves a drill sergeant, who can admittedly be quite effective if he's \\"breaking\\" a platoon of unfortunate young men, stripping them of their individuality, and \\"training\\" them to become part of a mindless killing machine. One whose volition and morality has been reduced to a single purpose: To be killers.    This film has the familiar drill sergeant, except we're to believe he's a musician. It just doesn't work, and perhaps you need to be a musician to appreciate that. Art transcends this military-style narrative - it doesn't obey the same rules. And it doesn't flourish in an atmospheres of violence or stress. If it does, it's inspite of it; not because of it. From VanGogh to Louis Armstrong to Joni Mitchell...the list of non-conforming artists is almost endless. It's hard to imagine any artist whose work has become well-known and appreciated, who could have tolerated five minutes with Mr. Fletcher.    And while art can emerge from sadness, depression, and other internal emotional states, there is no data to support the idea that any musician improved their innate talent because a third-rate music teacher inflicted physical or emotional abuse. There's not a single shred of evidence that any great artist enjoyed greater success due to being bullied or humiliated.  In fact, one could argue that the opposite is probably true.    Hollywood loves this predictable device, and I wonder if it's because America is still young and immature. It has this relentless need to recycle the same hackneyed themes over and over again, ad nauseum.  Furthermore, it has to be mentioned that the musician in this film has to be a drummer; the film can't work with any other instrument. Faster, harder, watch his fingers bleed. Art as blood-sport. Artistic achievement not through wonderment and delight, but via aggression and rage. And what is the goal? Not to write a great piece of music, or create something original, but to execute the notes with machine-gun precision. It is a joyless enterprise, to be sure. After all, we say \\"play\\" music for a reason; we don't say, \\"I work the guitar. I grind the flute.\\" Concepts completely void in the entirety of this film - you will not find a single scene where any musician is smiling.    To conclude, this is a very macho film - there is only one woman in this ensemble, playing the token girlfriend who is wooed and then unceremoniously dumped. There is no mother, sister, or a single woman in the top music class. Imagine the round-table discussions as this film was being assembled: \\"Should there be any women?\\" \\"Nah.\\" \\"Well, we should have a love-interest...(sigh)..\\" \\"Okay. Throw in some chick who works at the movie theatre but we'll get rid of her real quick.\\"    This year, we have American Sniper and Whiplash: Two films depicting different forms of violence and conflict.  What is really depressing, is that both films celebrate the macho bully. Guaranteed, this film would not have garnered an academy award nomination if the teacher had been morally defeated. The nomination confirms the essential necessity for film-makers to adhere to the familiar narrative that we all know and love: The bully with a noble purpose. It's safe.  How American....(yawn)
B00932A4XE|5|I Love this movie.if ur expecting this is the movie to watch...u will love it too!.very funny!!
B007LYB0PC|5|Jack White is beautiful, his music is beautiful, and the vinyl version is such a great experience. I love my record.
0790730960|4|1992 saw the release of the much anticipating &quot;Batman: Returns&quot; and it really is a mixed feeling movie. Its enjoyable but in the way it dosent match its predessor &quot;Batman&quot; it is very cool how it is all dark and got a creepy vibe and its storyline is OK but it just dosent really meet perfection. Penguin is absolutely disgusting and i really hate him and Catwoman is cool but in other words they are cool villians. Same &quot;SPECIAL&quot; featues as #1. This film is good and I reccomend you to see it but if u have to choose 1 out of the 2 &quot;Batman&quot; is the way to go.
B009GI8J1O|5|Loved the movie, love the book
B00992CF6W|5|It's a really fun app becuse its a sandbox also there is a app call maps for mcpe and it makes maps for mcpe just check the bottom of your world
B000JMLFLW|5|In my opinion, Pride and the Prejudice is a work of art.<br />From a teens point of view its quite beautiful. That leaves you in tears. Some might say its in a old time theme, but I would like to think the romance in this story is so typical every 2000 kinda day. We live in a world where men and women play the \\"I don't like you card.\\" Even when we have already fallen for that person. Instead of realizing right of the bat they were meant to be. Anyway, if you're looking for a nail biter, empty box of tissues, this is an amazing book. Don't over look it because of the title or date written. It's really a piece of art it's self.
B0036EH3U2|5|Ok, so some people have written about the bad quality of the blu-ray DVDs on here but I have to disagree with that. The grainy/scratchy visual shots really make you feel what the characters feel - they are dirty, tired, and full of despair, and that comes through so well in HD! I didn't know this show was a remake until I saw [[ASIN:B004CYF708 Battlestar Galactica: Cast & Creators Live at Paley]] where Ron Moore and David Eick talk about how they re-created the 1970s version into this show...and that makes even more sense in terms of the visual production choices.     The audio of this set was amazing. I've watched the finale probably a million times at this point and every single time the combination of beautiful pictures on screen, especially the fly-over shots over grasslands at the end, with the haunting
B005ARYDYC|3|i recieved this movie as a gift and when i got it, it was not wrapped in plastic and still had black marker on the top where someones name had been rubbed off. not thrilled but can't complain too much since it was a gift, just saying buyer beware...
B000SEGUDE|5|I have no words to describe how awesome I found this book.  Please just read it. Amazon is making me write more words; words that I don't have access to right now.  I will say this, READ THE DURN BOOK!
B008K6HN8I|5|Makes the Kindle Fire HD feel like a real computer. More easy to manage with file folders. A great and logical app.
0553418025|1|I wish this book was published during WW2 so the Nazis could have burned every single copy of it
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Keeps one guessing all the way.  I didn't know it was on the 50 best seller list until I had already finished the book.  So I agree whole heartedly/
B00BEK6Z7M|5|Love the Pendergast books
B006VFLIYK|5|Very good book well worth the purchase.  Amazon kindle is a great way to enjoy books.  This is a good action book with a good message.
B003TOPQI0|1|poor acting, poor scene, location...
1400031087|1|I read today where the publisher is offering refunds to who all bought this book and feel scammed becuase the author ( as we know find out ) lied. I took mine back today
B009LDD1X0|5|best comedy on tv, they play well together. They remind of the old<br />tv comedy of early tv, Good cast that you can tell that they love<br />what there doing.
B0086700CM|5|this game rocks the world don't get it if your afraid of cool monkeys. totally. get this you will love it. its awesome
B005KDDUVS|5|Buena novela, fascinante narrativa, con personajes maravillosos, y peculiares de los cuales uno se llega a enamorar como el carismatico Fermin. Historia de suspenso, amor, traici&oacute;n pero por sobre todo amistad.
B00005JMYI|4|This funny film tells the story of local celebrity anchorman Ron Burgundy and what happens to him when the all-male network takes on new reporter Veronica Corningstone in an effort to improve diversity.  The characters are convincing and except for some unnecessary fight scenes between the broadcast news networks, the plot was well developed and funny.  A light film, worth watching for some comic relief.
B00DJYKFXG|5|IT IS  THE BAND  THAT IS ALL YOU NEED TO SAY
B007J4T2G8|5|WOW ,REALLY GOOD CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT ONE. SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO SO GOOD.
0345529057|5|I love the show, and I love the books even more! The books fill in any gaps in the storyline from the show, and give you insight and backstory into each character. Very well thought out, and exciting. I especially like the character dynamics, as well as the shocking and unpredictable storylines. Can't wait for the rest of the books to be released!
B00AEFY0F2|5|I like to share this with my MBA students to reawaken their tolerance for those who are different in our society. I also love the phrase that life is like a box of chocolates and I do love chocolates and life.<br /><br />John Barnes<br />Bangkok Thailand
B00VFTCGES|5|awesome!
0060931736|4|This book is definitely a unique read. It is not afraid to \\"tell it like it is,\\" you may say. However, I found myself wanting to like the characters, especially Jean Brodie, much more than I actually did. I'm not saying that none of the characters were likeable, but I did have a difficult time feeling any sympathy or compassion for any of them.
B00AF6MF9I|5|Good fun. Slow coins. Slow oil. Slow medals. Not paying for it. Go figure.<br /><br /> Kills time. Brain cheese. Works well. No real issues.
B00B49L7Y4|5|Well done story set to great music from an artist previously unknown to us. Liked his music so much, we've ordered the movie soundtrack.
B0053O89JM|5|So far Season 8 has been an improvement over Seasons 6-7 that went \\"soap opera\\" with too much fantasy, in my opinion.  I was a fan of Season 1-5, and this season seems to be coming back to reality, and more about solving educational medical puzzles.<br /><br />Losing Cuddy and \\"13\\" seemed to remove distractions that made the show a disappointment in Seasons 6-7, and it is good to have new fellows as doctors with a fresh point of view on diagnostics and dealing with Dr. House who now has some restrictions on his ability to go crazy, and I think will make this season more believable.<br /><br />House seems to be back to his pill-poping self, but clearer thinking and slightly more aware of the rest of humanity.  I think Dr. Foreman moving to Dean of Medicine was a good move and places that role more in perspective.<br /><br />Having viewed the entire season 8, I enjoyed all except for the ending where Dr. House seems to \\"throw in the towel\\" when he usually would have found a way out, avoiding as much pain as possible, and still continue his struggle for truth and something greater than himself and his own interests.  Like all good shows, they never seem to have good endings.
B00K7C17QW|5|love it
B0002IQNAG|5|This is the original Dawn of the Dead, and the best one to me. The new version was good, but this one is the bomb. It won't let you down. You want look at Mall's the same again.
B00CH3DBNQ|5|Enthralling, inspiring, depressing, and uplifting! Should be read by all. Malala is one of the true heroes of out time.
1594488886|5|Great and heart wrenching story. It reflects the situation of women in Afghanistan in a very emotion appealing way, and helps us all understand the challenges women face in Afghanistan. Highly recommend.
B000ECX0QU|3|This review is for the movie in general, I bought the Hitchcock BD collection including this movie. All I can say is that it's a decent spy flick but nothing spectacular at all. I kept expecting some typical Hitchcock flare for visuals but nothing really happens other than a fairly uneventful 'cold war' espionage theme regarding the Cuban missile crisis. Good casting, good acting but the screenplay was quite boring. I can't see myself watching this over and over, more like once in a blue moon.
B00571F26Y|5|Eye-opening, stunning and logical, this book may have saved my life and made sense of complications I have had with my diet in past times. Unbelievably great!
B00DJFIMW6|5|Best game ever<br />Seriously play it... you're missing out<br /><br />DO IT<br /><br />Now<br /><br />I mean like right now man... c'mon yays
B009TGVUPA|5|Good story, GREAT ending!
0393312836|5|I think it best to summarize the pros and cons of this book as an elaborate description is already provided by other reviewers. <br /> <br />Pros: In my opinion, the Nadsat slang was wonderful and added a fresh, raw atmosphere to the story but that might just be because I could ask my mother what the Russian-esqe words meant. In any case, they weren't impossible to decipher on my own. The character of Alex was also fascinating because I never found myself disliking him for his inhumane actions better yet nursing a hatred towards him. A Clockwork Orange flowed wonderfully and I had a hard time putting it down. Reflecting back on it, the reader may find that it is indeed, a rather amusing book. I've always admired writers who can make the reader connect with their characters and Burgess is no exception. <br /> <br />Cons: The last, original 21st chapter. I'm a bit of a cynic so the negative, evil-will-always-prevail complex is rather appealing and more realistic than the we-will-all-eventually-settle-down complex, oddly enough. I finished the 20th chapter with a satisfied smirk whereas I finished the 21st chapter with furrowed eyebrows and a dissapointed sigh. I felt that Alex's struggle throughout one half of the story was for nothing, and his character itself faded away as the pangs of responsiblity corrupted his rebellious mind.
B00008CMR6|5|Easy and pleasant
1451678193|5|Cannot put this book down! Great work by Bradbury.
B00FCQQ1IW|3|Keep the Clifton story going! Hopefully they make a TV series out of it Waitng for next episode great read
B004J4WLB4|4|I liked learning about flowers and their meanings, intertwined well into the story line. Some parts of story almost too unrealistic to relate to but in general an interesting read
B00NSN70EK|5|I love td games they are so much fun
B008Y7J91M|5|One of the better movies based on a Jane Austen.  Its an awesome story.
B00DUGCLY4|5|I love this game it might be a little hard but you can look up the answer if you get stuck
B00MRHANNI|5|I love Taylor ! This CD comes with her photos and her music is great! My favorite songs are Style and Out of the woods.
B00GTCECVG|5|Really cool game and I enjoy very much!!
B00JB3MVCW|4|Really great acting. Phenomenal cinematography and CGI. Good storyline - differs from biblical version, but that didn't bother me. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie.
B007FG9LIE|5|I enjoyed how the books main story transferred almost exact to the new television show Wayward Pines. This book catches your attention and draws you into the entire series. There is action, drama, adventure, and plot twists which makes this book one of my favorites​.
B00AGJ4HC2|5|Simple, fast, engaging, and hilarious. Serves great as a filler or just play it over and over again the whole night.
B00005JMJ4|5|This movie was one of the best that I hae seen for a while.  It is a little slow, but it keeps your attention because you begin to love the characters.  There is great acting, and the storyline is excellent. <br /> <br />I would not recommend this movie to people that enjoy the boring and usual movie.  This one is actually original...I loved it.
B0095P33IW|4|Good mix of action and storytelling. I would watch it again. I would watch this before you watch the Avengers.

B0019LZV4E|5|Loved this movie.
B006LSZECO|4|Started off very interesting.  Got a bit tedious as the &#34;crime&#34; was being solved.  Still a good, quick read for a rainy weekend.
B008AK8FHM|5|I never wanted to believe there was a hell.  Now we have evidence that it does not exists.  No reason ever to fear death any more.
1401309666|5|[...]    However, the short version is this: The book is easy to read, and it has a ton of practical application for every business from snack food to shoe sales.     Even more important, it's fun, written like an article in a magazine and something you could knock out on a plane flight. Highly recommended.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Its a neat, fun way to pass the time without rotting your brain. Lol. I'm enjoying playing this game to pass the time, although when solving the blocks puzzles, you should always find something so it's not a waste of your energy.
B00P42WROG|5|Another great novel starring Bill Hodges...great characters, fast paced story...can't wait for the next one! Is he (Brady) or isn't he?
B00BP4Z8XY|5|and I still loved this movie. A good story is a good story, no matter who or what the characters are.
0316055433|5|I thoroughly enjoyed the book and Tartt's writing style. Not only did her thorough descriptions of scenes not bother me as they did some reviewers, but I was enchanted by them. I found myself rereading sentences from time to time, just because of being so taken with her exceptionally lovely weaving of words. I didn't find anything repetitious, as some had mentioned, even though I'd been prepared to be put off by it - it felt to me that it just kept moving along. I don't feel that the characters in a novel need to be likable - I can't related to that idea at all - but I did find the main characters perfectly likable, and I cared about them to the extent that I had to remind myself when I get tense for them that it was just a book. I wonder if we've lost a lot of our our collective ability to just relax and enjoy a book for the journey rather than being in a rush to get to the destination. I've talked with friends who've had the same positive reaction to The Goldfinch as I did, and I've recommended it to friends with no reservations. One friend brought it up the other day to recommend it to me, forgetting that I was the one who recommended it to her. It's an enjoyable read!
B008QYT7DI|4|A beautiful treasure of a book! Life lessons rendered in a heart warming yet surprisingly realistic way!
B000QCS8TW|5|I had trouble getting into this book at first.  In fact, I duel-read it with The Hunger Games and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I was finished them both before the action in A Game of Thrones began at about 55% through.  Once the action picks up, however, it's hard to put the book down.  The battle sequences are epic, with forces greater than 30,000.  I can't wait to start reading the next book.
B006MW3UZW|5|This is a great show! Love it! Didn't think I would be interested at all in it... I was wrong!
B00FKF0F3C|4|I was so happy to see that this book finally arrived.  It was very compelling and emotional and drew me back if I was away from it for too long.  Since this was the third book of the trilogy, I don't expect another volume.  However, we did not learn how Tanya and Vasili, and Dmitri and Natalya fared in the USSR.  It's disappointing to have grown so connected to these characters and not know their outcomes.  I absolutely loved the book until I realized that there were too few pages left to learn how they survived - or not.
B00DUGCLY4|4|I like it but I'm having issues with some of the problems, but I like how we can ask facebook and our friends
B005544TRQ|3|Very formulaic. It's basically House MD, but with layers.
0374533555|5|Includes their classic paper on biases.
0399226907|4|On the one hand, it's The Very Hungry Caterpillar - I love it (despite the upside-down butterfly on the last spread), I grew up with it, it's a great book.<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm not sure it's a book very well-suited for board book format. The best feature of the book, the holes, are too small to be much fun, and the normal audience for board books is perhaps a little young to fully enjoy this one - it's too wordy without any narrative tricks (rhyme, meter, alliteration) to pull them in.<br /><br />In retrospect, it would have been better to wait a few years and then just get the regular hardcover edition.
B002UM5BXW|5|Learned lots--extremely well written--a pleasure
B00E8KLWB4|3|Annoying at times.  Designed (of course) to make you spend $$$.
B004WMKSH2|5|Of course my title is referring to the character not the actor playing aforementioned Potter, as said actor is tragically creepy looking.

B00AHSMDQY|4|First off, the streaming experience in HD was flawless over our Roku box with high speed cable internet. We have Prime and that has had a few bumps in the past, but recently has improved and this rented movie experience was great.<br /><br />The movie itself was very good. It had the action you would expect, but also had alot of story to go along with it. I won't put any spoilers in my review. My 14 year old and I both agreed that we are anxiously awaiting the next installment of this series of movies.
B00062IDCO|5|Excellent!
B007SYWFRM|5|Great game very fast pace. I can't wait to see how well it play. Great graphics and designs . Recommend it highly.
1596003286|5|Once again, Lee Child has given us the cool, calm, and collected Jack Reacher.  Usually he is in the wrong place at the wrong time but makes the best of it.  This book starts out with Reacher being a little cocky and demanding that \\"I'm the best you've got\\" but as the book progresses, he's settles into the great character that I've grown to love. I always look forward to his next predicament.  Dick Hill's narrative really is the frosting on the cake.  What a talented reader!  I can't imagine Jack Reacher without him.
B0043GAZYS|5|This somehow got overlooked by a lot of people. It's a world of romance and violence as seen through the eyes of a genX gamer. It's pretty killer.

B00000G3PA|5|Armageddon is a great action flick from modern day master of action Michael Bay(Bad Boys, The Rock). The film is fast paced, with great camera shots, grade A effects, great sound and a great cast( what more do u want  to show off you DVD player).    The story is basically about some deep sea  drillers(Bruce Williis and Co), who are sent into space and needed to drill  an impact threating Texas-sized meteor, so a nuculear bomb can be inserted  to destory it.     Its much better than Deep Impact which has a simular  story line, and watchable again and again. The story may be unrealistic,  but who cares it an enjoyable movie with Bruce Willis and Co.
B00942OO7U|4|Very nice story line!
0790729369|4|This film was surprisingly good, reminded me of what a true virtuoso Meryl Streep really is...she really takes over every scene. Clint Eastwood is a competent actor but he can't hold a candle to her, she really is just magnificent.<br /><br />As I understand it, the bestseller it's based on is awful though, so this is one of those rare cases when the movie far surpasses the book instead of the other way around.<br /><br />What to say about it?  Plot-wise, it's one of those \\"ships passing in the night, a night that changed their lives forever\\" things except that instead of one night we have a 4-day affair, and one in which the outcome is a bit more convoluted than usual---lest I spill the beans for those who have not seen it, let's just say that there's a fair bit of \\"responsibility\\" and \\"self-transcendence\\" involved.<br /><br />It has a bit of the languid, leisurely pacing that Eastwood-directed films tend to have and a few clumsy moments with the minor characters but the scenes of Eastwood and Streep togther never failed to hold my attention, both beautifully shot and superbly acted especially by Streep.
014241722X|3|The book is not meant for an adult reader, but it is valuable in pointing out to adolescents and pre-adolescents that  not all lawyers specialize in the same thing.  For example, Theodore's father is a real estate lawyer, whereas his mother is a divorce lawyer.  He also tells his fellow-students what to do in different situations.  It is primarily a teaching tool, and probably very enjoyable as well as instructive to the young reader.
B00AYB0TOW|5|Such a Bad Ass Movie! Karl urban is a boss. This makes me want to see a lot more of his movies. Awesome action, brutal amount of death and violence, and good lines. Watch it. It's Epic.
B00IG2DOKM|5|Much more challenging than Farmville and more fun
B00C3UUZVE|5|I don't know how you can beat a free trial of a game.  This gives you a chance to test the game out, and see if your child likes it.  The game is around \\"planting\\" vegetables, and then doing the things needed to make them grow (water, sun, and fertilizer).  After things are grown, then you collect them to give to your customer.  Overall, a fun little game.<br /><br />Since it is free, you can really only grow a few of the veggies that are available in the full version.  This is not a major detriment (since it was free), but does encourage you to buy the full version to experience all that the game can do.

067443000X|4|The Great Recession and its aftermath laid bare the stark differences in wealth and income between those on the top and those on the bottom of the economic ladder.  Unfortunately, questions about economic inequality, at least in the United States, have been captured by the stale debates of the Cold War era.  Either you're a believer in the free market and, thus, a friend to America or your a Marxist/Communist and, therefore, an enemy to America.  Because of this any discussion on economic equality has ground to a halt.  Into this fray comes this work of economic history by the French economist Thomas Piketty and this book.  The most interesting thing about this book is how broad Mr. Piketty's research on inequality is.  He draws not just from recent examples of economic history, but looks about as far back as he can go in the historical tax records of countries in Europe and America and then attempts to stretch to even further back by peering into the distant past at times, right up to the beginning of the common era 2,000 years ago.  He even draws from examples in 19th century literature to show how capital has evolved from the rentier period of Jane Austen's time to the mixed combo of rentiers and managers of today.  As a history buff, I particularly appreciated his free use of history and historic trends to predict the future trends of capital and draw conclusions.  While freely admitting that the data is imperfect due to poor tax policies and records keeping in the past, the conclusions he comes to, in a lot of economic jargon, are these: 1. inequality from capital returns have always far exceeded inequality from incomes, with the exception of the war period of 1914-1945; and 2. with current global trends of low economic and population growth, if left unchecked capital inequality could reach levels at or greater than those of the 19th century, if they haven't already.  This calls into question the democratic controls of the economy that are the bedrock of any free people and nation.  Although most people will recall his idea of a global tax on capital as being a recent hot topic in political debates, really his analysis of the current trends in inequality ought to be what is discussed with his global capital tax being the starting point on debates regarding what to do about it.  I won't lie to you, this book is a tough read.  It features a lot of economic jargon that is not easy for anyone who isn't a trained economist to wrap their heads around.  And even if you have a rough understanding of economic terms, the concepts may still go over your head.  I'm not even sure I caught everything in this book.  Still, for those with the intellectual grit to slug it out with this book, the rewards of better understanding a complex topic that affects us all will be immeasurable.

B00065VTU4|5|There really isn't much more one needs to say about the guitar work of Eric Clapton, every album is going to have some stellar axe work regardless. So every now and then Mr. Clapton has to break out of his shell and come out with a great song album, and this is it. 461 is the pinnacle of Clapton's solo career and will probably never be equalled. Most of this album is subdued and melancholic, with a rocker thrown in for good measure. However, songs like the brilliant \\"Please be with me\\" dominate this mellow and resonant album. There are no real hits on this ablum with the exception of motherless children. So in a way, it may the least familiar sounding of Clapton's work.  <br />Mr. Clapton has always wanted to be a singer/songwriter of sorts, even with his considerable guitar work. In this particular case, he pulls the singer-part off quite well.

B00AFROVQC|2|I purchased and read up to mid-way through the 3rd book of the series in the hope that a decent story line would improve - but it didn't.<br /><br />The book (and series) is too \\"juvenile\\" is the best way I can describe my experience. I was left with the impression that the author might be the same age as the main character - 14 years old. The main character starts as a 14 year old and the entire first 3 books seem to cover probably about 1 - 2 months tops in his life. He is continually thrown into life and death situations and emerges as a great hero from each. The so called training he receives in the \\"Legion\\" seems to involve throwing untrained boys of 14 - 19 years into life and death situations to see whether they survive and somehow become better \\"warriors\\" from the experience. One minute wooden swords are being used, the next real weapons are being thrown at him with only a shield to stop serious injury or death.<br /><br />If these three books are representative of the authors other works then I won't be wasting my money.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star rating was because underneath the rubbish there is a potentially good story line. But I really couldn't stomach the thought of buying anymore of the series or even finishing the third book. The three I read are in serious need of a major re-write - it is a shame the author doesn't use the services of a decent editor (well, I assumed from the contents he didn't!).

B003UESJHO|4|THE FIGHTER may be based on a true story, but that doesn't mean that much of the skeleton of its plot doesn't feel like a rehash of Hollywood clichés.  Struggling blue-collar guy from a dysfunctional family gains a shot, late in life, at boxing glory.  Various obstacles get in his way, but with the love of a good woman and some unconventional training & methods...he gets his shot at the title.  It's the kind of plot that would not normally get my blood pumping in anticipation.    But of course, THE FIGHTHER is brought to us by the singular director David O. Russell (the brilliant and very sadly overlooked THREE KINGS), and features some amazing performers.  It's a true story.  And it's a two-way shot-at-redemption story.    Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is a boxer from Lowell, MA who has been under the management of his mother (Melissa Leo) and the tutelage of his half-brother Dickey (Christian Bale).  He's not had much luck, mostly serving as a punching bag and stepping-stone for other boxers.  Dickey is himself a boxer, one who once battled Sugar Ray Leonard and knocked him down during a fight.  But Dickey is getting on in years AND he has a pretty serious problem with crack cocaine.  His drug usage makes him late for training, late for flights and just generally a volatile and scary person to be around.  In the early going of the film, an HBO crew follows Dickey and his family around...Dickey crows about how the film crew is documenting his comeback.  And we have to wonder how anyone could seriously think this shrunken, mumbling, twitching man could ever mount a comeback.      Mickey seems doomed to a 3rd class boxer forever...and already sees a life of working on a roadcrew or a roofing company as the only thing he has to look forward to.  He comes from a FRIGHTENING family.  His mother lives in a middle-class house with her SEVEN daughters.  All these women are imposing and just a little crazy.  The daughters cling to their mother like harpies-in-training...andMom is a force of nature.  She clearly believes that she has business savvy and that she has the best interests of her sons in mind.  But she is really a blue-collar monster.  Her domineering presence has stopped the men in her life, including her current husband, from blossoming.    But Mickey meets a bar girl, who is just as rough and blue-collar as anyone else (Amy Adams)...but this is the girl who will pry him away from his family.  She's tough and fearless.  There's a great scene where she is first introduced to all the women...and the scrutiny, name-calling and obvious hatred that fills the overcrowded living room would surely crush a lesser woman.  But Adams stands her ground, and finally Mickey can talk back too...just a little.  Later, circumstance gives Mickey the chance to take on a new manager and some new training, and his career begins to head in a new direction.    I don't want to say any more.  The journey these characters take is gripping stuff, and I'd hate to spoil anymore.  And the journey is greatly aided by some terrific acting.  Melissa Leo (so fantastic a couple of years ago in FROZEN RIVER, and prior to that in 21 GRAMS) is a powerhouse.  Here's an actress who has no ego and no qualms about making herself physically and emotionally ugly.  Just knowing she was in the film was enough to grab my interest...she's that good.  Amy Adams plays against type as a character earthier than we are accustomed to from her...and she's amusing and fun.  Wahlberg gives another restrained but effective performance.  He has a style that is becoming very familiar now...the nice guy who is perhaps slow to speak and slower to anger...but when it comes out, watch out.  But we root for him throughout, and it is his emotional journey we follow gladly.  Christian Bale, however, is more problematic.  He absolutely looks the part...once again, he's dropped weight and made himself look his part.  But his manic energy, which is appropriate for his drug-addled character, seems showy and flashy.  The other characters feel like people we might meet and recognize...Bale is acting on another, more \\"actorish\\" level, and he feels removed from everyone else.  For him, this appears to be \\"The Christian Bale Show.\\"  I admit, I'm not a fan...I really dislike him as Batman/Bruce Wayne...but every time I think I'm being too hard on the guy, he reaffirms my inclination to call him vastly overrated.  (That being said, he WAS great in AMERICAN PSYCHO.)    THE FIGHTER isn't quite the movie of the year.  But it's endlessly interesting, directed in an effective and restrained manner, and for the most part, impeccably acted.  The locales feel authentic.  The boxing scenes are excellent and easy to follow.  And the fact that it's true certainly adds something.  I recommend it enthusiastically.
B004D7GU3C|3|Musica+Alma+Sexo is not only Puerto Rican heartthrob Ricky Martin's comeback record, but also his attempt at staying relevant in a world where every five seconds a new pop star is born. Is he successful? Somewhat. Does he sound like he is trying too hard? Sometimes. Could he have made this a memorable work? Absolutely.     Where to start when talking about Ricky Martin and the legacy attached to the name? True, he is a pretty boy. True, he popped out of a prefabricated boy band. True, he got on the spotlight at the right time. But it is also true that the guy has talent. His voice is as malleable as his looks and his knack for setting a trend has worked. Until now, at least.    The first thing one notices when listening to MAS is how he continues to embrace the crowd pleasing sounds of today, but does not really look much beyond that, so the results are stale. Take Frio, for instance, a Latin-infused song that will surely be a single soon, that never takes off even in the remix version (featuring Wisin and Yandel) mainly because its construction is basic, flat. Lo mejor de mi vida eres tu is a feel good jingle that sounds more like something a soccer mom would be playing on the way to pick up her kids, than something a young listener would sing along to, that is, unless they do not what good pop is. Title track Mas (or Shine n the English version) sounds more contemporary and gives the record a great intro and a little edge, but unfortunately it leads nowhere past the third song.     I believe the problem with MAS is that Ricky has tried too hard to make it a multi genre record. In doing so he has lost perspective, shot in every direction possible, and dwindled the great possibilities lyrics and rhythms used here had.     With Cantame tu vida he scores a hit. A simple, acoustic song that sails smoothly and where he shows his vocal skills. The complete opposite happens with Te busco y te alcanzo, which departs from a mellow verse into an unbearable whine that is as annoying as surprising for someone who is a master at nailing ballads and infusing them with a living soul.     It is impossible to not bring up Martin's recent admission of homosexuality and its influence in his image and his creative process. Where it may have opened the gates to writing a successful memoir and been the key to gain acceptance from the audience (and disgust from those looking for hidden reasons), it has not contributed to delivering a solid record, as many of us expected. Musica+Alma+Sexo sounds contrived at times, over dramatic at others, but overall it is not the explosive comeback we wanted to hear from him.     The question of whether he is a relevant figure may be tricky for he is a recognizable icon in the arts, but is it because of that alone or because of the quality of his work?

B00AQTY3XA|5|Great tale of big-wave phenom Jay Moriarity and his mentor Frosty. Storywise it's basically a bit of a mix between North Shore and The Karate Kid but a bit more realistic since, well, most of this stuff incredibly really happened shortly after the spotlight for big-wave surfing had turned from Waimea Bay and Todos Santos up to Mavericks. Like most Hollywood surf movies it has its share of necessary cheese here and there to drive the story along, but overall it's a film as solid as the surf it depicts that surfers and non-surfers can enjoy and be moved and inspired by. The soundtrack is perfect for that moment in surf history (Sponge, Mazzy Star, Butthole Surfers, The Offspring, Matthew Sweet), and the cameos by big-wave chargers like Peter Mel and Greg Long provide the necessary credibility and access for the project. Also just figured out Frosty's wife is played by Abigail Spencer watching Jimmy Kimmel whose brother is Sterling Spencer (just featured in Surfer Magazine) of the Spencer family which is Gulf Coast surf royalty (Yancy Spencer III, Yancy Spencer IV, founders of Innerlight Surf Shop - most surfers will likely recognize these names). Lots of great special features on the Blu-ray. Not sure which was harder, the surfing, or operating the many types of camera rigs used?! Really a great film worthy of any surfer's collection. LIVE LIKE JAY!

B002ZG9800|3|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 3 1/2 stars<br /><br />This is a movie that I decided to watch twice as I was initially confused as to Jim Carrey's take on the character he plays--Steven Russell--the gay con artist who's now serving a life sentence in a Texas prison for a series of multiple con jobs which almost puts Bernie Madoff to shame (not quite in terms of monies embezzled but for the sheer style and inventiveness of the con jobs he pulls off). I found 'I love you Phillip Morris' a far more convincing portrait of gay characters than 'Brokeback Mountain' since the film's creators, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, appear to have no interest in promoting the dubious (and politically correct) stance that gay people in general have been perennially oppressed from time immemorial. Here, Carrey as Russell makes it quite clear that he's not ashamed of his gayness one bit. In perhaps the most surprising and clever scene in the entire film, Russell, enthusiastically engages in sexual intercourse and we expect it'll be a repeat of an earlier scene with his wife. But lo and behold, as the camera pulls back, we find that Russell is having anal sex with a man, as he proclaims via a voice-over that \\"I'm gay, gay, gay!\\".<br /><br />Not only should Carrey be commended for taking on the role of a gay person who has a real ego and no apparent guilt feelings about being gay but for also portraying a character who is almost completely amoral. Thus Russell is shown to be a rather complex character--not your usual gay 'victim' but rather an unrepentant victimizer! When Russell meets Phillip Morris in prison for the first time, he shows off his sensitive side by advising Phillip on how he can obtain social services for a critically ill AIDS patient Phillip has been trying to help. Later he sends some of his ill gotten gains to his ex-wife and daughter and seems genuinely interested in their welfare. But Russell is also an obsessive-compulsive character whose love for material things prevents him from feeling real empathy for others. Russell is like a pathological gambler who can never stop placing one more bet. And even his lover, Phillip, is simply one additional object he must reclaim, after it becomes clear that Phillip is no longer interested in him and his bizarre and brazen schemes to obtain Phillip's release, are no longer working.<br /><br />Carrey's take on Russell is always pretty much sympathetic. Some viewers may be put off by the elevation of a con man to such a sympathetic status but if Spielberg could do it in 'Catch me if you can', why can't it be done for a gay character here? The first third of the picture, however, is more an affectionate ribbing of a certain kind of gay lifestyle, than a more serious dissection of a certain kind of asocial, pathological behavior. Carrey goes a little too far into making Russell seem like a buffoon in the scene where he confronts his birth mother. The attempt at black humor when Russell continually advises a new inmate that the only way to get ahead in the prison environment is to perform oral sex, falls flat as the subject matter is more tragic than comic.<br /><br />The film really picks up as it examines Steven's and Phillip's relationship in prison. Ewan McGregor is excellent as Russell's boy toy and even displays a dark side (similar to Russell) when he approves of Russell's paying off an inmate in another cell block to beat up another inmate in their own cell block, whose been keeping Phillip awake every night by shrieking in a continuously loud and repetitive manner.<br /><br />Carrey is in best form when he poses as a lawyer and gains Phillip's release and then lucks out when a Judge approves a judgment for a friend of Phillip in civil court. Russell acquires untoward riches by defrauding a medical management firm after being hired as their chief financial officer.<br /><br />After Russell's scheme is uncovered, not only is he jailed but Phillip is arrested asan accomplice. This after Russell promised Phillip that his behavior at the medical management firm was above board. As we learn at the end of the film, Phillip actually does about seven years in prison as a result of Russell's machinations. So it's quite understandable that Phillip wants nothing to do with him by the film's end.<br /><br />For those who find that Russell's life sentence is excessive, consider this: Russell puts Phillip through unconscionable emotional pain by allowing him to believe that he's died of AIDS. Then he has the audacity to pull yet but another scheme, posing as an attorney again, and once again place the man he supposedly is in love with in jeopardy. Phillip slapping Russell in the face is wholly justified. It becomes clear that Russell's pathological behavior will never end and that promises to change are insincere. That perhaps is why it's best that Russell be incarcerated for the rest of his days is the right move (although 23 hours in solitary confinement may indeed be \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\").<br /><br />Ewan McGregor as Phillip has the best speech in the film when he speaks with Russell over the phone, believing that he's about to die of AIDS. He acknowledges in his own sick way, Russell did indeed love him but he could no longer maintain a relationship with him, as he knew that Russell would return to his manipulative and self-destructive ways.<br /><br />'I love you Phillip Morris' is one of those films worth viewing more than once. You'll find that it's a cautionary tale about naivety (Morris) and self-deception (Russell). Jim Carrey is not always successful in his portrayal of Russell, who may come off a tad bit too sympathetic. Nonetheless, Carrey must be praised for taking on the difficult role of an amoral and charismatic con man.his behavior at the medical management firm was above board.

B0000A1RJI|3|Overall I liked this soundtrack as it contains the musical highlights of the film. However, the production aspects of the CDROM are lacking. First, it appears the individual tracks were made from one best-of type of arrangement. This arrangement doesn't follow the story-line from the movie, so it seems almost arbitrary in nature, even though the composer/arranger might have written it that way originally. Secondly, the dynamic range of the music is so great that it isn't possible to listen to it at one volume level in most venues. Parts of the music are inaudible unless the volume is turned way up and then the sections of fortissimo are bound to disturb the neighbors three doors down, unless one is listening alone in a sound proof room. In fact the climactic moments cause distortion on my ipod nano headphones, even when at a volume level of only 75%. While it may be technologically feasible to produce a range of this level, I question the benefit it has to humans. Maybe if I let my dog use my ipod or play this soundtrack underwater for a whale, they'll be able to fully appreciate the full spectrum of the experience. Finally, the album is too short. For a full length feature film you would think they could have put together more for us but maybe there was a lot of looping in the movie that would have made much of the content on the CD redundant. <br />It's a good buy though, given its faults, for any fan of the series. <br />

B001609SQA|5|There is not a lot to add to this film review that has not already been said.  30 years later and this film is still one of the best action movies of all time.  It sets the standard for what an action movie should be, alongside Predator and Terminator 2 as the best in the genre.<br /><br />Aliens is an incredible thrill ride with great acting a ton of action/suspense and lots of comedy thrown in.  The film sucks you in and you care right away for the cast of marines deployed to save the colonists on planet LV426.  I have seen this film so many times I know every line in the movie and it never gets old.  Sigourney Weaver was excellent as Ripley and showed that the lead actor did not need to be a male to carry an action film. Where the first Alien film focused more on Sci Fi Horror.  Aliens is more Sci Fi Action, it is to bad the 3rd film sucked so badly.  I wish the movie studios would stop making Alien and Terminator films they are just diluting the product so badly from the original 2 films, what's next Care Bares and a G rated Alien film.  I like the fact that Ridley Scott is going more for an origins story in films like Prometheus instead of continuing the burnt out Alien sequels.<br /><br />What sets this apart from so many CGI action films today is how real everything looked.  The set design team did an awesome job, nothing in this film looks fake or phony onscreen.  The Queen Alien special effects are spectacular even 30 years later, they will always beat a CGI reproduction.  The cast and crew really make this film.  The movie has a very high rewatch value to it.  Bill Paxton is hilarious as Hudson.  No matter how many films I see him in, he will always be Hudson to me.<br /><br />I remember back in 1986 when this film came out.  I was six years old and my parents would not take me to the theater no matter how much I whined or cried.  That was probably a good thing I would have had nightmares for quite awhile and not enjoy the movie as much as I do today.  I feel like I cannot praise this film enough James Cameron probably made the best sequel in movie history besides Empire Strikes Back and Godfather 2.  A truly 5 star movie.

B0070NSPCU|5|I will keep this short and sweet since I agree with most of the previous reviews. I am always on the search for new authors in the Sci-Fi and Fantasy genre.

I am sure that this book will be one of the few that I read over and over. I greatly anticipate Book Two and can only urge you to hurry! Thank you for the profound enjoyment and pleasure this book has brought to me. You may be assured that I will be recommending the book to all and any who will listen.  You have my deepest gratitude.

B00HWHPQPS|5|I have seen every episode of this show at least twice and i have to say that this season while as some have said isnt as good as the others it is still a great show i just love how this show is trying to wrap up the show through a season that is slowly bringing all those pieces of the mother we have glimpsed over the past 8 years together into one great ending. I am excited to see how the rest of the season goes and i am also just excited that Ted is finally almost done telling his kids the story of How he met their mother. Also i think that this season is about showing all the things that went right and wrong in those last few days before Ted met the mother so that in the end it will explain how he stayed in Jersey and raised the kids there instead of Chicago and it will show all those things that new viewers might not have seen in the previous seasons. So while they are dragging this out i also think they are letting the show end in a way fitting of a show as good as HIMYM has been to those loyal viewers over the years.
B004VMUS9G|5|I use the Alarm clock extreme for taking my medication. I take different types at different times, so with this alarm clock I can set the Alarm and give it a title like what medication I am taking. It also has a feature where the Alarm starts off softly and it slowly gets louder as it goes, so it doesn't scare the earthworms out of you, which I really enjoy.
B0058ZZDVS|3|I enjoy watching this show, the characters are smart, fun, and compelling. But honestly, not nearly as good as I expected. It sort of feels like the boy's version of Damages - a lot more flash and dirty talk with a lot less substance. The acting is pretty good but I wouldn't expect this show to be winning any awards anytime soon.

B000PKG7I4|4|[[ASIN:B000PKG7I4 Frank]]  Great work of music I love it, but imagine my disgust and surprise when I tried to download the CD I had purchased and waited months for Amazon to send to me (I got a back-order notice at one point) to my iTunes so I could enjoy \\"Frank\\" on my iPod but couldn't. Very clearly printed on this cd is an \\"FBI Anti-piracy Warning: unauthorized copying is punishable by law\\".     Since when is backing my music up to my iTunes and listening to it on my iPod a crime? Fine (not). So then I went to iTunes and paid $3 less for \\"Frank\\" plus I received two bonus songs. And it's on my iPod now. Which is how I listen to my music 95% of the time whether through headphones, my radio adapter or hooked up to speakers in my office.     So, two things learned here:   1. This album was worth buying twice. It's that great. I love the sexy and playful ode to office crushes in \\"Amy Amy Amy.\\" The wicked humor of Paris-Hilton-wannabes bashing in \\"F**K me pumps\\" is tinged with just the right amount of that kind of bitchy-sweetness you get when smiling while insulting someone.     Where Amy's amazing album \\"Back to Black\\" smacks of a 1960's alcohol and cigarette-ravaged,  dive-lounge torch singer hasbeen who's still pushing it with bravado every Thursday and Saturday nights, \\"Frank\\" (being three years younger) has Amy's voice a bit fresher and smoother but there's still that attitude in her performance and lyrics that makes the album a necessary part of the Winehouse collection. If you like the retro attention given to \\"Back to Black,\\" \\"Frank\\" uses it in a milder but effective way.     2. Always try to make sure, when purchasing from Amazon, that there is a notice in the product page that the cd is \\"FBI-protected.\\" If there is no such warning, and you intend to download something to your MP3 player, maybe just try iTunes first. Or...Amazon: where's your online mp3 download store?

God Bless you. This book is a 100% pure joy and Blessing. I am so Glad I bought it.. 10 thumbs up!!! :)
B000IDCJK8|5|Great story of good ultimately triumphing over evil.  Clint Eastwood provides a great setting for this intense drama of small town greed, murder and revenge.  Thoroughly enjoyed the movie - great storyline and great camera work.
B00CH87HF4|5|Great multiplayer game and has the option of soloing.
B0055QYKQO|5|Solid performance, good bios setup and nice IO options. My only complaint is that all the usb ports are 3x power which doesn't always work great with my sound card (saffire 6)
B00DR0PDNE|3|Chromecast can turn a dumb TV into a limited capability smart TV for only $35. That's the good news. The not so good news is that you cannot (currently) &#34;cast&#34; local content from your PC or Android device even though the hype implies that you can.<br />  The device set up easily and performs well with the very limited default apps, and you can &#34;cast&#34; a tab from Chrome on your PC or laptop to your TV (NOT your android device) . Keep in mind that &#34;casting a tab&#34; from PC (or laptop) based Chrome does not include any of your local content (photo files, video files, music files, anything from your hard drive).<br />  That said, Google promises enhanced capability in the future as more apps become available, so time will tell. For the time being the device falls short of my expectations (my TV was already smart enough to stream Youtube, Netflix and others, and I certainly expected to be able cast from my Android smartphone).<br />  So read all the reviews, be careful of the hype, and do not set your expectations too high before you buy. This product is OK but not for everyone.
B00IK590UI|2|Not as good as the original
B004SDSSFY|4|As a university teacher who is always  on the go, this app is essential to me. After purchasing the app, it was immediately sent to my Samsung Galaxy S III smart phone. Note, the free version has to be downloaded also...not a problem. You will just end up with 2 documents to go icons on a home page; delete one. I deleted the icon without the key pic.<br /><br />The app allows you to start or continue working on a word or power point or spreadsheet document. This is great!<br /><br />I am a satisfied  purchaser of the documents to go app and I recommend it.
B00JVZ0DQG|1|I just played Green Thumb Games on Kindle Fire. I feel cheated out of half my points and the dog prize. My items sold. The picture of the coins jumped, but the number next to it remained the same half the time. I came in 6th place, but if I had received proper credit for my work, I would have gotten one of the dog prizes. I tried to find a Zynga customer support number or e-mail address, but no luck as everywhere I looked, it took me back to a Facebook page with Known Issues, Question & Answers, and suggestions to ask fellow players for help.
B0054TKAZW|5|Very addictive series. Characters fail to show much depth at first, but as the series progresses we get a better look into each of their lives. At first, it seems they are all sex crazed teenagers, which gets a little old. Alison is also a very irritating girlfriend as she shuts Scott out for very idiotic reasons, that was the only really frustrating thing for me.
B00BWBHIUG|5|This is a very good game. It is teaching me responsibility. It is also keeping my baby sister occupied. Great game &lt;3. I hope there are more games to come.
B000AJIF4E|4|I've had these for about a year. The sound quality is good. The ability to block outside noise is marginal at best. The ear cup &#34;faux leather&#34; skins have already torn, which has no effect on utility, but with the foam exposed, I'm sure they will degrade quickly from now. I have new &#34;knock off&#34; pads on order: The Sony replacements are quite expensive, particularly considering their short life.
145162445X|5|Why are we here, \\"here\\" meaning \\"the universe\\"? Where did we come from ? Where are we going?These are the big questions of life and existence; various religions have addressed these questions almost since we  started thinking, some 40 000 years or so ago. Likewise, philosophers have tackled these questions, and are still toiling away looking for answers. Enter physics, with an astounding array of tools with which to attack these questions: quantum theory, string theory, cosmology.  As I understand quantum theory (and, really, who does), in the beginning, \\"nothing\\" split in half. This was what has come to be known as \\"the big bang\\". For the most part, these two halves of \\"nothing\\" recombined. The remainder, what was not part of \\"for the most part\\",pure energy unbelievably hot,began expanding. We, the universe as observed, this planet, we as individuals, our cell phones and satellites, are the result of that expansion.  Some fascinating questions arise: what did the \\"expanding universe\\" expand into? What does \\"the end game\\" look like? Is our universe \\"unique\\" or are we just one amongst a multitude?  Occasionally Professor Krauss wanders off into the thickets of quantum theory and cosmology, bot for the most part the book is highly readable  Fundamentalist Christians who believe the universe began 4017 years ago at 2:30 PM will not like this book. Likewise, philosophizers may discover they've been chewing on questions that aren't really relevant anymore.  I enjoyed it, though.
0743454537|5|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I loved everything about the book.<br /><br />I was able to really grasp each character in the book and understand what each one of them was feeling, and why. It's just a great read. I couldn't put it down, and you won't believe how it ends. Highly reccomended.
B007EECSFA|4|I liked it.  It paints a picture of wartime in Europe and what it was like for the people in that time.
B00002MZ2C|5|This record is at least as good as Evil Empire, if not better.  If you like the progress these guys made between their first and second albums, you will probably really dig this one.  They explore some very new  territory, including songs that border on being ballads (dont worry, Rage  even manages to kick it on these tracks).  There is a lot of material on  this album that might remind the listener of No Shelter, from the Godzilla  soundtrack.  The best thing about this album is that the lyrical delivery  matches the song much better than some of their older stuff, which makes  these songs stand out in live performances.  Free all political prisoners.
B00RL9WRAE|1|This is nothing more than a slasher film. I was greatly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous with major gaps in logic. I was surprised that Denzel Washington was a part of something this poor.
B007J4T2G8|1|Why is this trilogy a best seller? I barely got through the first chapter, and I returned the book (Kindle version). It's full of sloppy, silly, juvenile writing from an author who should be renamed Captain Obvious, since it was clear exactly where the plot was going within just a few pages. What a waste of money. I just don't get all the hype for this junk food.
B000Q6GX5Y|5|Compared to DVD, 300 is 300 times better in Blu Ray. So crisp you can see the sweat comming from the pores on the spartans. Excellent buy especially for the money. You just can't beat this price on amazon
0671042858|3|The overall plot (a young girl lost in the woods being trailed by a mysterious creature) is interesting yet the book never quite delivers creepiness that readers expect.  King shines in this book with his fully-fleshed and believable characters as he does in all of his work.  However, when measured against other King titles, this one falls behind.
B00BLCHZC2|5|nice
B005ZMUWWY|5|The pure fact that it took years to animate this movie and to develop the storyline and soundtrack for a mostly dialogue free movie is enough to gain it 5 stars. But, it also provides a challenge to our modern age of glut and excess.  When we value our ease and comfort over the needs of the world and environment, we risk running into the same traps as the people in this movie.  Wall-E is a lovable robot who heroically attempts to save a tiny plant, and ultimately the fate of our planet. His efforts are valiant, and even though he cannot talk, he communicates love, compassion and a drive that most of us non-robots do not have. Every time I watch it, I am encouraged to exercise more, and to care for this lovely world a bit more. I think that is the point they were trying to make. To the producers, writers, artists, etc of this film--well done!
B00BRH2MN8|5|This band has such a fun & unique sound that I was instantly a fan. I just wish the album had more songs.
B004EBT5CU|5|THE best new album I've heard in a long time!  Some of her songs stick in my mind all day.  I chose this as a Christmas gift for a group of friends.  Everyone should experience Adele 21. Adele 19 is just as creative.
B00CWY76CC|5|This is sooo addictive! I need more rooms please, there are not enough! Some levels are frustrating, but solving the puzzles is a rewarding experience!

B003TH14H4|5|Great show !
B00003CXV4|3|Interesting, but slightly unbelievable story of a workaholic who takes up a crazy women's offer to stay with her for a month.  No workaholic would take that offer, but Keanu Reeves does.  I loved Charlize Theron's portrayal of this character, she is the only good thing about this film.  And be forwarned, this is not the fairy tale it seems to be.  The movie was shooting for the top and the typical fairy tale ending, but went the other way.  Too much to believe in, including the ending.  Watchable, but not that great.
B00CHSPB8Y|1|This game was a waste of my time and waste of unnecessary bandwidth. Launching this application made all of my other functions useless.
B0071XO8RA|5|This book was awesome!! I was obsessed! I kept looking for excuses to read. When I was busy with my day, I was wondering what was going to happen. I was itching to get back to the book!! How else can I tell you that I loved this!?!?!<br /><br />I truly hope there are more books in this world. There is a Q&A at the end where he hints at there being more. So I am cautiously but very optimistic. I'll be the first one in line for the next installment!!!<br /><br />(Written 04 June 2012.)
B0036EH40Q|5|An amazing Western.
B0097EWK3A|4|I enjoyed the game.  It had a good story and plenty of hidden objects and puzzles.  The objects were not always obvious which made it more challenging than some of the games.  Big Fish usually has good choices.
0553213105|5|I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.<br />From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.<br />This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read.
B00Q7WBGHG|3|this was our gift to our daughter-in-law. She loved it.
B0061S073A|5|I love this App, I put it on all our devices. I love that as soon as the device turns on you can set it so that it automatically directs them to the kids place app where you can select what it does and doesn't allow them access to. It has a fun background or you can choose one of your own. You can disable purchasing ability and internet access as well. This is the best program that I have found for us. To get out of the app you have a  4 digit code, the only downside to that is older kids might be tempted to try to &#34;crack the code.&#34; But my little ones love it.
1579128955|5|Wonderful way to get anyone to learn the elements and remember them. The cards are also great. I used both! I absolutely love this book and wish I had it when I took high school chemistry! It would have helped me to have a better understanding of what I was doing!
B008RA3X5E|4|I love this alarm clock.  It's the only one that wakes me up.  I can sleep through regular alarms easily.  Just love it.
B0087HT36U|4|An acceptable take on the genera. Probably worth whatever it cost when it isn't the FAOTD (as long as that price is 99&cent; or less anyway).
B005SAP45I|4|It was a good family video...I gave it 4 stars because we watched it with our 3 year old boy and there were a few words like &#34;kill&#34; and the violence in hurting cars that we could have done without.
B00D3NSDVO|5|From line one page one, a gripping story, for some reason it seemed to disappear from the Book Shops, and I thought it is such an amazing story and characters so real that the Government, had decided to redact the title as it was the genuine unbelievable diaries of a genuine Agents experience. What a great novel!  Please write another one a as soon as possible.  Nothing can be the same again!  THANK YOU,  Terry Hayes.<br /><br />Sincerely,  John S McFall

B004LQGXPA|5|I've watched this movie over 10 times in the past.  They don't make movies like this one anymore, so I continue to view this movie.  The only movie other than this one that was really well made, was Private Ryan.  It really provides a insightful story of why Patton was such a great leader.  He was definitely NOT a politician; he spoke his mind and said things from his heart.  At least he was very honest and a soldier's soldier.  I've spent over 24 years in the service...I wish there were more generals like him.  Most of the great generals have been railroaded out of the service because they spoke their mind.  General Shinseki told the Sec of Defense and the President that we needed more men on the ground than was planned.  He was accurate in his assessment, but was essentially fired because he spoke the truth.  There was a general fired after the Dhahran bombing, believe his name was Schwayer.  He was railroaded out of the service too, as he was blamed for the bombing.  If you know Dhahran, there's really no way we could not secured that really secured that sight.  The sight is smack in the middle of the town, as everybody knew the risks, but didn't do anything to secure the site.
B000002AD0|4|Recorded well before Santana's classic 1969 debut LP, this hometown concert set is notable for several reasons. It features a stripped-down, five-man version of the band, with conguero Marcus Malone and drummer Doc Livingstone, both of whom would be gone before SANTANA was recorded. The jams here are lengthier and hotter than their studio counterparts, from the blistering opener \\"Jingo\\" (a showcase for Malone which makes one wish he'd stayed around a bit longer) and the jaw-droppingly prefaced version of \\"Persuasion\\" to the inevitable - but still tasty - \\"Soul Sacrifice.\\" Most of these pieces, however, would never appear on a Santana studio album, and I'm quite confused as to why. Gregg Rolie's evocative handling of \\"As the Years Go Passing By,\\" the sliding ensemble performance of \\"Chunk-a-Funk\\" and the psychedelic fury of \\"Conquistadore\\" make for what seem like sure-fire cuts from a band celebrated for its onstage flights. Carlos Santana has seldom if ever played with more flash, and the entire band's level of musicianship is exceptional throughout - though \\"Freeway\\" does get a bit long. Fans of the early, grooving Santana will certainly want this set, and all live album enthusiasts are encouraged to give it a spin. Great stuff from a very young and talented band!
B00004T9UF|5|... The Marshall Mathers cd is just as brilliant as The Slim Shady cd.   My personal favorite is Under The Influence, ...  Another one, that I think E is directing to the bullies and others that tormented him as a child, is Remember Me?.  Criminal, Marshall Mathers, I'm Back, etc., are all excellent songs as well.  So, if you want to hear some of the best lyrics ever recorded, get this cd.  If not then go get the Backstreet Boys or N'sync, they might be more on your level.  Remember, don't judge other people when you have no idea what kind of life they have led.  Oh yeah, just wanted to give a quick kudos to Dr. Dre, for discovering the most talented rapper to ever come along, and for taking a chance with him so we all can enjoy his music. Thanks Dre. he really adresses the point of the lyrics in these songs. ofcourse the hit &quot;the real slim shady&quot; is unhatable and i could go on about it all day but all i can say is i would give it 5 stars. i would give every single song on this album 5 stars, judging the lyrical content and the beats. they are all great. songs like &quot;kim&quot; are shocking but it makes you realise that stuff like abuse happens and it shouldn't. &quot;stan&quot; is just a great example of copy-cat fans and is a crude reminder to fans that EMINEM shouldn't be copied, whether his songs are jokes or not. in &quot;stan&quot;, the angry fan copies what EMINEM did in &quot;kim&quot;. even if &quot;stan&quot; is a lesson for fans, it's the most creative and brilliantly written song i've ever heard in my life. buy this album, it will blow you away after you have gotten over the offensiveness of his words. and if you actually find it too offensive, then, this is a message from EMINEM... &quot;GO AHEAD!! SUE ME!!!&quot; but it won't get you anywhere and as if he would care if he got sent to jail anyway. have a great time listening to this album. enjoy. by Nobby the Great
B000QRIGLC|5|This story reads like a novel but it is an actual account of a dangerous operation.  It provides insight into the vast array of skills required and possessed by these dedicated people.  Although it comes across as a little too self-aggrandizing,  I would also recommend  The Red Circle by Brandon Webb.
B000BW7QX6|5|SERENITY is a awesome movie! The special effects are really fantastic! The story line revolves around River Tam (Summer Glau) whose brain holds a secret the Alliance doesn't want known. They send out an assassin to find River so they can control her. Captain Malcolm Reynolds, so aptly and brilliantly played by Nathan Fillion, protects her and her brother, Simon. He tries to stay one jump ahead of the assassin and this makes for edge-of-the-seat action. The one disappointing aspect, (to me, anyway), is that the relationship between Mal Reynolds and his lady love, Inara Serra, (Morena Baccarin), is not expanded or explored more fully. She sticks with him through thick and thin, and in the end, he doesn't seem to appreciate her devotion to him or show that he's really glad she's staying aboard Serenity.
B00004XPPE|5|Fail Safe is an excellent study in the various philosphical and political attitudes of the Cold War era. I use this film when I teach Cold War literature to my junior English class.

B0052UZIFA|4|Most newcomers to the Plants vs Zombie awesomeness will probably be satisfied with this game as is. I, on the other hand, being a gamer have been playing this game since release date since the days I was called a loser for playing a game that looked like it was meant for kids. Hah, were they wrong when you play some of the levels. However, where's the rest? Adventure mode.. Cool. But, where's the puzzles? And it looks like iPhone just got Zen Garden, so here's hoping we'll be getting the full PC/Mac version on our phones soon. The fact we were able to get it for free for a day gives this game four stars over three for being a small port of the full version. Just goes to show Popcap is still in tune with its fanbase.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|captivating reading, best mystery yet. Grisham is great., can't put it down. can't wait to finish it. thank you. more stuff please.

B0081SRJSY|4|Initially, this game required a wireless connection in order to use your (purchased) expansions.  It has updated so that that requirement is no longer in place.<br /><br />Like many board games converted to video form, it actually plays faster digitally than it does with the physical game. Even with pass-and-play, this is faster than breaking the whole game out.<br /><br />The app also allows for several scoring versions (the board game has had a number of changes over the years), so you can play your preferred version.<br /><br />It sure would be nice to be able to pick-and-choose tiles and other elements from those you have purchased, but I 100% understand why that isn't an option - it'd be a programming nightmare.
B00A6N8F4Y|2|I like the idea of this movie. Entrepreneurial young bucks in a twisted relationship with a stupid girl. One guys doing his civic duties with ill-gotten gains and the other just wants more. I actually like Benicio in this movie. Travolta is wasted. Blake Lively offers nothing but something for the boys to fight over. I can't even stand the sound of her voice narrating the film. Salma Hayek looks weak as a female kingpin. I don't like the way her character is written. It offers no real twist in her development.<br />I'm glad I saw it but it wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be.
B000ICL3CE|5|I have close to all of The Cure's studio CD's plus many that are rare but for some reason had never purchased this one.  Although I already had several of the songs it was definitely worth the wait to hear a couple of songs for the first time.  The whole CD is consistently great and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is builiding their collection of works by this unbelievable band.
0553278355|5|The spiral towards insanity is painful, abrupt. Often feeling helpless and trapped - drawing each breath and wondering if one should just give it up or carry on aimlessly. Some break free but others remain mired in the glassy stifling interior. <br />I wondered if perhaps between the honest and  often brutal lines, Plath was confiding her heart.
B006LSZECO|3|Finished several days ago and still trying to figure out what I thought of it. Maybe not my normal type of book and took that into consideration when rating. First half kind of drug for me, so I skipped a head to find out about the girl and then went back. The ending disappointed me, kind of felt like the last couple of chapters were missing.

B00IBZ5YKW|4|this book was not what I was expecting. since I read the first book, wonder and since I knew it was from the perspective of a contrasting character. I was expecting the book to be told in a let's say \\"braty\\" way. my prediction was totally wrong. I loved the way the the book played out and liked how it was told from Julians perspective. Even though it wasn't what I was expecting I still loved it. and I will probably read it again and again.
0307408868|1|It was an excellent read.
B00M7UTFW0|1|Boring and unrealistic
B00BAXFAJC|5|I chose this rating because the book was my first experience with a mystery novel. After adding some notes on my kindle to remind me of many characters, reading it was a breeze. It was interesting and intriguing. I would recommend this book to a new-to-the-genre reader and tell him or her to stick with it because it is worth it.

006135323X|4|Predictably Irrational is one of several popular books about the way people really make decisions and judgments. This growing sub-genre includes Nudge, Sway and Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me).<br /><br />Ariely lucidly explains the findings of various experiments about decision making. It's easy to find applications in marketing: offering options that serve as anchor points and recognizing the power of \\"free.\\" These findings are useful but I would like to see more discussion of the implications for everyday life.<br /><br />For example, most of us cannot predict how we will behave when we're swept up by strong emotions.  Yet every day judgments are made by jurors in courtrooms based on, \\"Well, if I were in that situation...\\"<br /><br />Ariely points out the futility of taking too long to make certain decisions. One friend kept dithering over the choice of a digital camera, only to forego months of memories captured on film.<br /><br />Similarly, he feels he took too long to evaluate a job offer from Stanford. But for major life decisions, a lengthy process can be rational, even if you sacrifice current productivity. You have a greater likelihood of identifying the fact or factor that will be the ultimate deal-breaker.<br /><br />Ariely created an experiment to demonstrate that keeping options open comes with a high cost. So, he says, keeping one job or one residence for a long time can have a high payoff. Maybe. But often outsourcing options or industry shifts will kill a career. As a career consultant, I advise clients to focus on marketability, not security.<br /><br />Second, Ariely shows that money changes relationship dynamics. As he says, your family would be insulted if you offered to pay for Thanksgiving dinner.<br /><br />But while he advocates a greater role for social norms (p. 88), money norms often smooth difficult transactions. The New York Times magazine recently featured an article by an unmarried professional woman who needed a kidney. She wished she could just pay for what she wanted instead of being forced into difficult conversations that threatened her friendships.<br /><br />Many of us who move frequently have learned to pay packers and movers rather than seek help from well-meaning friends. After all, your helper might drop your new high-definition TV on the sidewalk (maybe breaking a toe in the process).<br /><br />The absence of money also affects relationships. When strangers email to ask how to resolve a challenging career question or fix a troubled website, I often wonder what goes through their minds. When friends ask, they risk the friendship.<br /><br />Third, Ariely suggests (p 121) that we apply lessons from auto maintenance to motivate individuals to undergo medical exams. This reasoning seems flawed.<br /><br />Tests won't prolong lives the way regular oil changes prolong the lives of car engines. After a diagnosis of disease, you should consider false positives. You embark on a journey of life-changing (and life-threatening) medical procedures, lifestyle changes, battles with insurance companies and endless waits to deal with rushed, indifferent or even rude medical staff. A better analogy would be to compare medical exams to auto diagnostics (which car owners rarely choose) or else compare teeth cleaning to oil changes.<br /><br />Insurance creates economic disincentives that muddy the waters. I know several people who had tests that came back negative -- no disease. A few months later, these folks developed symptoms that suggested a need to repeat the tests. In every case, the insurance company said, \\"No -- you get one a year.\\" One person told me her doctor ruled out her disease based on a test she'd taken a few months earlier. So skipping a routine exam can be rational.<br /><br />Any benefits of early detection accrue to the individual, not society or insurance companies. Those who stay alive while making ongoing demands on the medical system will cost more than those who are rushedto the hospital in crisis and die shortly afterward.<br /><br />In any case, Ariely discusses how doctors resist research findings that point to the effectiveness of placebos. Just what is rational thinking, anyway?<br /><br />Overall, though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Ariely's writing entertains as well as informs. We all need to base our decisions and our lives on how human minds really work, not what \\"everybody\\" knows.st research findings that point to the effectiveness of placebos.

0517147688|5|I made the mistake of purchasing the paperback 8-in-1 Jane Austen book -  what a mistake!  It was sloppy and cheap-looking, with its unattractive, clumsy two-column format that didn't seem to show due respect to the material.  I found it too depressing and unpleasant to read, so I ordered this version, and I am so happy I did!  What a gorgeous book, classy and elegant, with lovely illustrations, nice typeset, padded leather cover and gilt edges.  And for only a few dollars more, it's a no-brainer decision to choose this version over the paperback.  Even if you go with a used copy, it's still a far better bargain than the other one, and something you'll enjoy reading with pleasure for years to come. I will definitely look into the other classics in this series.
B00OZVRYXG|5|A Good episode with one whopper of a cliffhanger ! Cant wait to see part Two !
B0040I09RM|5|Love the series, hate the buffering, I have netflix as well and I don't ever have a buffering problem when I watch it. I'm new to amazon and I don't know if this is a common problem, all I know is it is nerve racking
B000YHG72E|5|I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. IT IS ONE FOR THE AGES! Will Ferrell is so funny. And it is a movie that my family and I watch every year&#62;
B00CE2G3AS|5|great
B000AP04OM|5|This is a clean copy of an all-time favorite.  Many of today's kids have not seen this movie.  Have a sing-along party too with the extra features.
B002HFWBUI|4|I think most people don't understand this movie. This is not a love story, at least not in the conventional sense, nor a porn film. &#34;9 1/2 weeks&#34; is about sexual desire and intimate sensuality run amok and becoming the monopolizing forces in a relationship, and the ultimate demise of that relationship as a result. Certainly the physical pleasures and sensuality of sex are aspects that make a relationship fulfilling and gratifying but they are not the only facets. A relationship purely and solely based on sexual pleasure is doomed to failure. At first it seems like a game, but later on the intensity is too much for the relationship to withstand, largely because if love and caring are sacrificed for the sex, it will die.<br /><br />You almost couldn't find more suitable casting than Mickey Roarke and Kim Bassinger. Roarke plays John, a sexually-driven finance executive who is not satisfied with winning over the woman he wants. He craves continual heightened sexual excitement from his &#34;lady friend&#34;. And he uses subtle coercion to achieve his goals. For Elizabeth, played by Bassinger, John is the ideal lover. He makes her breakfast, buys her clothes, brushes her hair. He takes care of her in an interesting role reversal. But nothing is free. In return, John wants Elizabeth to be in his complete control and engage in sensuous sex games. And each game is more intense than the last.<br /><br />At first the games seem innocent enough. He likes to blindfold her and play a touchy-feely game in which he introduces objects that she feels and/or tastes. But then the requests become more intense. He wants her to enact a strip-tease, to dress in a certain way without her consent, and to spank her for being a &#34;nosey parker&#34;. They have sex in the oddest of places, sometimes engaging in intimate contact in public. At first Elizabeth enjoys the attention and the excitement until she begins to lose the sense of herself as the relationship intensifies. And John eventually goes too far.<br /><br />At one poignant moment in the film, Elizabeth speaks with an artist-recluse. Because her job is at an art gallery, she helps coordinate artists for exhibitions. When she finds him in a rural area, she asks him if he remembered that his exhibition is coming up. He replies that when he is hungry he remembers to eat and when he is tired he remembers to sleep. She has lost the simpler pleasures of life, and this old man reminds her of that.<br /><br />Late in the film there is an interesting scene where Elizabeth's former boyfriend comes to the place she works--not to see her but see one of her co-workers whom he is now dating . He's a plain man who does not have nearly the sexual allure of Roarke. But he seems kind and honest. Liz watches her co-worker and her former boyfriend from a distance as they leave. There is an expression on her face that speaks volumes: maybe she misjudged him after-all. For a moment, the two stare at each other from a distance, and you get the feeling that she was the one who left him. He is not the Mr Exciting that John is, but maybe he has other qualities that John could never have.<br /><br />This is quite a stunning film, certainly not for all tastes, and some of the steamy sex scenes could be misinterpreted as being only for pornographic sake. What saves it are the incredible and absolutely believable performances by the two leads, Roarke and Bassinger which strangely complement one another. Roarke plays his character right on the money, always enigmatic, never raising his voice, but always mysterious. His character is always just outside of reach. He constantly smiles, even when he is noticeable disappointed. Basinger is a perfect complement as one of the few actresses left who can be vulnerable and elicit a willingness to be under control that you don't see in many female performances anymore. Despite what may appear to be pornography, there is a point to the film I think, and that is that constant sexual control and nurturing relationships mix like oil and water. In the end you wonder if it was all a game.xual control and nurturing relationships mix like oil and water. In the end you wonder if it was all a game.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Great book! I really enjoyed it. It is witty and dramatic,  and will make you ball your eyes out every time you read it

B004LAIU4I|5|I picked up this Paul Simon album in advance of going to see him in concert recently.  I really didn't have expectations about the disc either way.  For me personally, his post \\"Saints\\" albums have been okay, but nothing really grabbed me about them or demanded my attention, other than - yeah, sounds like a nice, aging Paul Simon, not bad.  Since my somewhat random purchase, I can't stop listening to So Beautiful or So What.  The music - understated guitars and percussion - is excellent and suits the melodies well.  But most importantly, he brought the songs.  And you can tell he actually is proud of these - his singing and committment to them is refreshing.  There are a few lesser tracks, but generally this is a great album all the way through.  It is a grower -- except for the first track, there really aren't any immediate pop songs as he's written in the past.  So give it some time and you will be rewarded.  My favorites are Dazzling Blue, The Afterlife, Rewrite and So Beautiful or So What.  The concert, by the way, was fantastic.  Paul Simon has still got it.
B00PTAEXTK|5|I love music but if I had a teacher like this guy, I'm afraid he would have taken a lot of enjoyment out of it.  Good acting but a miserable human being for a teacher.  Thought the drummer was great & happy to find out he really is a musician.
B00FAX6XQC|4|A great game game, but it's impossible to get weapons in the store that cost gold or silver coins without being forced to buy the coins with real money. Some weapons cost over<br />750 coins, and so far, I only get one coin each time I level up. A fun game, but PLEASE make it easier to get coins, or lower the prices of weapons that cost coins. Looking forward to Deer Hunter 2015 d: (btw I'm kind of an animal lover, I only play this cause there's no harm in it d:)
B00E31EF6C|4|Great person, I hope you live forever
B00BJ9VBLI|5|Loved it!
B001P06GX4|5|Fun game!  Great game for kids around age 5/6.  Adults love this game to and good to play on a cold, wet winters day.  We have bought this as family gift for friends.
0553801473|5|Not as great as the first 2 or 3 by Martin, but a great book in a great series of books.  Martin lives up to his reputation of always keeping you guessing by putting his character through situations that change their lives.
6305897786|5|The movie starts with a man committing suicide and he is the one who sold a version of the book to the wealthy book collector. A book dealer is asked to inspect a rare book to verify its authenticity for its owner. The wealthy book collector, Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) shows Corso his book collection focused on the devil and his prize book is The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, printed in Venice in 1666.<br /><br />Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) tells the owner that two other copies exist but only one is the original version. The original book was supposedly written by Satan and it contains nine engravings that will summon Satan himself. Corso accepts the job but he should not be trusted. He will lie and cheat to buy rare books at a fraction of their real value. Corso travels to Europe to speak to the other owners and look at their books and try to purchase them and at least get to look at them.<br /><br />Corso is authorized to buy the real book at any and all costs, even if illegal. Balkan gives Corso a large check to finance his trip and time. Corso's trip proves both to be enlightening and suspenseful. He is seduced, attacked and his friend is murdered in a ritualistic way as depicted in the book.<br /><br />This is a creepy and suspenseful story. Not each book is identical and perhaps it takes all three to summon Satan. Corso's mission is the basis for the movie and it presents a very good storyline. The acting in the film is outstanding. This really is not a horror film but more of a film about the occult and the beliefs in the devil. It is a deep and dark film that keeps you guessing until the very end.<br /><br />If you like scary and dark drama films then this is a good one for you to watch. There are no monsters or special effects; it is just a spooky story about raising the devil.
B008Y212PI|4|Good game. Challenges the mind which some people these days need more of.  I would recommend it as a good way to pass the time.
B00JB3MVCW|5|Worth the watch.  I enjoyed.

B00D7Z4GQY|4|Good read...
B009AMANBA|5|When I ordered it I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it but I truly loved the way the story was told and the accuracy of history
6303394000|5|When I first saw this movie, I loved it!  It was so unusual...not at all the typical musical.  Now (how many years later?), it's still one of my favorites.  One of the rare ones that's withstood the test of time.  Don't  expect the same old jazz.  It's realistic and disturbing.  You'll be  thinking about it long after you see it.
6305428425|1|I was really excited to get this DVD in the mail as it is one of my favorite movies of all time. I immediately noticed it was rattling around in the case and when i opened it one of the middle tabs that holds the DVD into place was broken off the the DVD was just moving around so I was not happy about that but then when I put the DVD in to watch it I was even more dissapointed. The quality of the DVD is horrible it looks like someone recorded an old VHS version themselves in zoom mode. Half of the time I couldnt see all of their faces no matter what setting I would switch my tv to. I dont know if it is just because I picked the $10 movie and maybe I should of payed up for the more expensive one? Either way it was a bad purchase.

B000002U8G|3|This album could also of been called \\"Muddle\\", or \\"The Best And The Worst Of Pink Floyd\\".<br />This becomes apparent after one listen, the first and sixth tracks on \\"Meddle\\" are superb; the other four aren't.<br />The album opens with \\"One Of These Days\\" with whistling wind and then both, Gilmour and Waters, break in on. Lovely vibrant bass lines. The double bass carries on through out the song giving it a very heavy feel. The only words spoken are \\"One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces\\".<br />The song was dedicated to Jimmy Young, the British Radio D.J., who the band had been having a running battle of words with for several years. The song reaches a dramatic climax with Gilmour laying down some of the greatest slide guitar work he was ever to put down in the studio, skipping straight onto the sixth song on the album, \\"Echoes\\". Originally it had taken up the whole of side two of the vinyl \\"Meddle\\" released in 1971, clocking in at twenty three minutes and thirty seconds. From the opening submarine type radar echoes you know that the Floyd have combined to give us a real classic. Each musician excels in his own department, Nick Mason changes the role that percussions would be seen in from here on out in rock music. The drums are not just used as a way of keeping time with the song, but actually as a lead instrument. To this end Mason comes out of this song with great Kudos (if you get the chance to see the movie \\"Pink Floyd Live At Pompey\\" you can see what a devastating effort Mason had both sonically and visually on this song). \\"One Of These Days\\" is the oldest song to remain in the Pink Floyd live set list right up to their last tour.<br />Roger Waters laid down a solid bottom end to the song, never letting the weirdness get totally out of control. Rick Wright's keyboards caught him at a creative peak and his psychedelic solo in the middle has often been copied but never bettered.<br />The vocals were handled by duets between Gilmour and Wright which suit the song wonderfully, although lyrically it's just gobbledygook. However, it's the guitar playing of a young David Gilmour that really catches your attention as he rings every ounce of emotion from his six strings, reaching higher and higher as each passing section of the song progresses, at the same time both violent and controlled. \\"Echoes\\" was to remain in Pink Floyd live set for many a year before \\"The Wall\\" took over the whole show. It was even dusted down and brought out for the commencement of \\"The Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\" tour (the first Pink Floyd Tour without Roger Waters) before it had to make way for newer material.<br />Compared to these two wonderful pieces of music the other four songs on the album are horrible. Of the two worst offenders is \\"Fearless\\", which, after meandering listlessly for seven minutes, finishes with \\"The Kop\\". At Anfield, the headquarters of Liverpool football club, singing \\"You'll never walk alone\\" and then chanting \\"Liverpool\\" is all very well if you're a scouser of the red persuasion, but a bit of a bore to the rest of the world. Worse is to follow with \\"Seamus\\". Nearly three minutes of nonsense with David Gilmour stumbling along on acoustic guitar, mumbling some lyrics, whilst Steve Marriot's dog howls and yelps over the top of it. Truly embarrassing to listen to. It's what you might imagine Manuel from Fawlty Towers to come up with if you left him in a recording studio.<br />So my advice would be to get hold of a copy of \\"Meddle\\", cue your C.D player to programme tracks 1 and 6, and forget the rest...ht which suit the song wonderfully, although lyrically it's just gobbledygook.

B005OCFGTO|5|Love it! This collection should be in EVERY household- child or no. This is a great start to inspire imagination
B00881VLCE|5|this app is so awesome! you get to do adorable puzzles! all the puzzles on this app are fun filled!
B00849F82E|4|Worth the time to read this book. It gives a good perspective from another angle. Compare with C. S. Lewis and Spurgeon.
B000001ZS3|5|Do not look unfavorably upon this peenemundic project.  1976 PONG came out (and how far has computer gaming evolved).  Same holds true for electronica.  1976 OXYGENE was categorized under jazz (?). Now we know it as the Sputnik that changed the space and contour of a developing genre.  Jarre's musical elements built upon set confirurations offering a whole new order of dimentionality.  With this LP he expanded the ring of the horizon and allowed cosmic integration for a much greater spacial atmosphere.  With futuristic energy and french melancholy he released composition from the conventions of naturalism.  This progressive conviction to soar was expounded upon by numerous musicians to what we have today.  A potpouri of electronic space/thinking music.  The final oxygene track is the best arranged sculpted space you shall ever hear.
B00UN9PQN4|5|Excellent sound, excellent presentation! Love it as much as the original release!
B005COO1X6|5|awesome King book!
B002ZG997C|4|\\"The Book of Eli\\" is one of those mini-epics where the hero is regaled for his relentless quest to achieve one compelling aim in life.  Denzel Washington gives a great portrayal of Eli who is consumed with verbally recreating the last Holy Bible in the world into book form.  Denzel's mastery of martial arts and firearms comes off a bit uncoordinated, but you can appreciate and give dramatic license to the attempt.   \\"The Book of Eli\\" is reminiscent of \\"V for Vendetta\\" where the hero commits his life to destroying the tyranny of England, which has become a world power--once again.  The similarities are uncanny---the doting young woman who comes to worship the hero for his courage, consolidated power in the hands of one man, and a legacy reborn following the triumph and death of the hero.    The ending of \\"The Book of Eli\\" did not have the grand finale of \\"V,\\" because it attempts to turn the disciple into a post hero---which is not a good idea.  Great heroes emerge from conditions average individuals take for granted. There is a level of sensitivity endemic in an individual who longs for and finds a life's calling, which is not easily transferable, no matter how inspirational.  The gift of remembrance and a commitment to excellence is the purist and most authentic homage one can give to the hero.  Hollywood, in all its glory, loves to tantalize audiences with the possibility of a series of characters who become \\"Eli.\\"  If everyone could become Eli, where is the specialness?    I recommend watching \\"The Book of Eli\\" and \\"V for Vendetta\\" to embrace and celebrate the possibilities of the human spirit.    Edward Brown  Core Edge Image & Charisma Institute

B006LSZECO|5|Book much better than the movie!
1582701709|1|The worst book on personal development I have ever read. (being a coach and reading 80 books a year, winning the prize as the worst book was not easy).   The metaphorical message of the book is right: change your thinking and you change your life, embracing the future you want. But the author goes way beyond that, declaring that the universe will conspire with your positive thoughts and make things happen for you. She even tells you that if you are receiving bills to pay, it's because of your negative thinking: think positive, and you will start receiving cheques!! (well, that's convenient!!)  so, although the principe is right, the book goes way too far, thus deluding people into thinking that just thinking hard about something will bring change. thought without action is just philosophical debate: actions in accordance to our thinking is what shapes our future. No matter how you pray, at the end of the month you will receive your elecricity bills!
B005PZ85SO|5|I enjoyed watching season 7.  Season 8 is slow to start and not as exciting.  (Not sure about the replacement for Prentiss)  She doesn't fit.
B00008PW3Q|5|I am a relatively newcomer to Fleetwood Mac. 1997's Dance helped to reintroduce me to many of their greatest works. I as of yet have not obtained every Mac album or have even heard every song. Still, this album delivers for me.<br />Every track on this album has something to offer. The music is deep and complex. The voices are used and considered an instrument in the production. The use of stereo is splendid. I imagine the dvd-a version is oustanding as well. <br />The bass and percussion are oustanding as always.  Lindsey continues to shine and make me wonder why he doesnt get more praise for his talents on the guitar.  Stevie's &quot;mystic&quot; sound and lyrics astound. When her songs are given to Lindsey and &quot;Mac'd&quot; its pure magic.<br />There is something on this album for everyone.  There are tracks that feature the &quot;classic&quot; mac sound only they can do.  There are pure rockers that will shatter ear drums when played live. There is even a song i could see being played in dance clubs around the country. The final track on the album is a sweet song by Stevie that touches you in the heart no matter how much you fight it. One of her most beautiful works.<br />Christie is missed. On a few of the songs i can imagine how she would sound performing them. She may have brought a bit more balance to the album overall.<br />Still, this album is a gem. It is stong enough to satisfy loyal fans while new enough to bring in many more. Its not pop, rock, blues, or country.  Its fleetwood mac. They are truly a genre of their own. Enough said.

B00BD99JMW|5|I love this book. That's all I have to say. It's just a good book with lots of emotion in it.
B007SGLZP8|3|First I want to say, I really enjoy authors like Grisham,Baldacci,Flynn,Silva etc, they've kept me up at night, made me late for work, forgot to do laundry and burned food all because I couldn't put a book down...now having said that, this book has a few spots that will make you keep reading,but overall the story is far from the best thriller you will ever read, the premise to the story is about a con, how a plot is executed (don't want to give anything away in case you're going to read it so I'm purposely being vague here)and believe me when I say, it's not believable BUT it's a fun read. I did enjoy the book, but it's not on my list of \\"must read again\\". This felt like a book a student of Grisham would write in one of his classes if Grisham were a teacher and gave an assignment that was \\"try to write a book like I would write\\" , the emphasis on the word \\"try\\"  - it's good, it has interesting parts, but all-in-all not a great book.<br /><br />Short review:<br />Good - not great, thrilling - sometimes, forgettable - yep !
B00B4FU6KE|2|Was not to my liking regarding content.  Seemed like a roller coaster ride...or riding on a wave that went up and down, in and out.  On a  more positive note I will say the write definitely did her homework in research.
B004QL7K70|1|Seeing the trailer of this movie made me think it was going to be a good movie to have and see more then ONE time, but of course NOT. Horrible movie of all time! The title is catchy and interesting. but never want to see the title of this movie EVER again!
B000U1ZV8K|5|You can't beat this DVD. All four Lethal Weapons movies for a few bucks and you know you are guaranteed to watch them more than once. Gibson and Glover have some real chemistry going right from the start and there is a strong supporting cast - although I'd had more than enough of our idiotic friend Leo, shouting around the place for no good reason, by the last movie.    As the franchise develops, the story lines get a bit weaker and the comedy aspect is played up. So Lethal Weapon 4 has lost the pathos of the first movie completely. No matter, it's a great watch with some spectacular baddies and some great martial arts. The sinister South Africans are my favorite criminals in the series.     Buying this set, which comes on two, two-sided DVDs, is a no-brainer. Enjoy.
B003BD236C|5|A tense and very atmospheric film that reflects on the Cold War fears of the day.  The film may be somewhat dated, but the plot of the movie does invite discussion and introspection of today's weaponry.  Are we Fail Safe in our abilities to harness the great destructive powers we have attained?  This film will make a lasting impression and one that still brings questions to the table.<br />Fonda and Hagman are brilliant.  Very well developed.  5 stars.
B00FQMVCEA|4|My sons love this movie, although the plot and characters do mimic that of Cars almost to a &#34;T&#34;.  But, provides enough laughs and storyline to keep my interest.
B00HQI7VMY|5|Great blu ray transfer!Good sound too,no surround but real nice stereo.Not many songs you're going to want to skip,one of my very fave live shows.Lots of classic performers doing very heartfelt performances of GREAT songs!This looks like it was shot in hi def yesterday.Really happy this was finally released on blu ray!

B00KA87GCW|4|Cute game. Loads to do. Funny graphics.
B006ZAZ31U|4|I would have liked to have loved this book. After all, the story is so compelling. However, the writing  did not do justice to this story at all. There were too many details in some parts, which ultimately became boring, and not enough insights into the character development of this young man. In the end it left me cold and emotionally unaffected, without any real understanding of what makes a man a hero. Really a shame as, with better story telling, this could have been a great book. As it is, it is only mediocre.

B000006045|5|At first, you won't understand it.  You won't like it.  You won't listen  to it.  Then it will start whispering to you and it will snake its way into  your consciousness until you have to return to it.  And then it all falls  into place.  You're hooked.  Just buy it.
0385338686|4|This was a great book... very sweet and funny.  If you like to know what happens with an epilogue there's none here.  That is the only thing that i would have changed.   <br />Very similar to 'can you keep a secret?' instead of the shopahoic books.   <br />Loved the characters and the story.
B00L9B7IKE|3|It was good. Got boring I the middle. A little redundant. Kept going on and on. Then it got good again. Liked did t love it.
075640407X|5|While I love fantasy and science-fiction, I am very hard to please.  I spend hours looking through books looking for something that hooks me and when I find an author I like I try and read everything they've written.  Patrick Rothfuss is now on my must-read list.   <br /> <br />I picked it up because Tad Williams' sang its praise and after reading the book I cam here to Amazon and found Robin Hobb's positive comments.  If you love their books as I do, you'll be happy to know they are sincere.  The book is worthy of their praise. <br />
B006G35QGI|5|It's a family favorite. My girls thought it was hilarious to see the mother/daughter interaction. Even better than the original.
B00CWVFPGO|5|Great action!
B00881VLCE|2|Awkward to move the pieces around.

0679809015|5|Our Grandson loves this book! It's just the right size for his little hands and he has all the doors figured out.
B008JGSM6G|5|I've played this type of game on a PC as a mini game. Thought I would try it out on my Kindle Fire HD. I've not played for long however it's a lot of fun, quick & easy to do. I've just started the larger squares so it will get more difficult, but it's not something a player would need to take notes on to remind them where they are or what they need to do next. It's like playing solitaire, it's &#34;relaxing&#34;. It's a game you can play for a few minutes, then put down.
B000GOU4M4|5|Christmas Vacation is our families favorite Christmas movie.  It usually gets viewed several times during the holidays and occasionally during the rest of the year.  Love the Griswalds.
B005544TRQ|5|Suspenseful and witty series.  Mildly addictive.
B006ON41FC|5|This game is great for long car rides and other things to pass time. I highly reccomend! This is a great game and great for little kids!!
B00C1C0WCQ|4|For being the third in the series it wasn't a complete disaster! It was well done, the dinosaurs were very abundant and the story line was good! Can't say I'm a big Tea Leoni fan but other than that it was very good.
1551111225|5|This story STILL haunts me since first reading it in college, 20 years ago. It is about a man so destitute and desperate he sells his wife and baby daughter.  Unburdeoned, his pockets full, he goes off to seek his fame and fortune.  Though he becomes the wealthy and much-respected Mayor of Casterbridge, he is unable to escape the horror of what he has done. Everything he has built threatens to unravel when his dying wife shows up, almost-grown daughter in tow, seeking a guardian for her child. So well written, so cativating, it is like the making of a braid, every page woven together neatly, to a grand and shocking finale. This book turned me into a Hardy fan.
B000SZK41M|5|My favorite Christmas movie. My favorite action movie. Bruce Willis is perfect!
B0089LOG02|5|I loved this book. Lots of history with a great story line. Couldn't put it down, I highly recommend it.

B002DQLGHU|4|The movie is a fun adventure that is great for all ages. Particularly fun for young kids, but you can definitely watch it as a family film. Can get tiring after the first few times, though.
B00HDMMISA|4|Great book!! Highly recommend.
B001VPJYZK|5|This must be well written, directed and acted I tell myself.  Because if it isn't, I've turned into a complete moron.  I wish I could say that I didn't avidly see this each and every week and wholly enjoy it.  But I do.  All five seasons and this one was no exception.<br /><br />Premise: 5 mostly married women in affluent suburbia and their trials and tribulations as such.  A sixth is dead, killed herself in her house at the start of season 1.  She narrates the entire show and I really enjoy her narration. The series jumped ahead five years in season five and that ended up being a good move because pursuing the same problems from the prior four seasons may have been tedious.  5 years ahead there are so many new problems that you didn't need to concern yourself with what was done.<br /><br />The strength of the show is in its writing and directing.  There is not a wasted word or scene in each episode.  Each episode manages to be both dramatic and darkly comic at the same time.  This writing and directing is what keeps this show from descending into soap opera.  If the skilled use of dark comedy was not used effectively throughout, this series would descend into mawkish melodrama.  Because of this wit, style and writing, I don't really care what the recent crises are on the show, I care about seeing how they handle it as a piece of dark comic theater.<br /><br />Don't worry about losing one of the housewives on this show, worry instead about the geniuses behind the camera who are creating this each week.  They are the ones who make this work.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B004LOMB2Q|5|I just love this app!! I swear I use it for everything from recipe and craft ideas to keeping track of business transactions. It runs so smooth and its super easy to transfer things from one location or page to evernote! Plus I can take it wherever I go. I use it on my tablet, my phone and several different computers between work and home. I just can not say enough about this app so I'll leave it at that! =)
B006RXQDH8|1|Usually movies with violence don't bother me.  Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan are two of my favorite movies and they are full of violence.  However, this was full of senseless, over the top, stupid bloody violence.  I have no idea how it ends because I felt disgusted with myself for even watching the first hour.  Tarantino apparently wanted an excuse to let Uma Thurman slice and dice as many people as she could and make some crazy blood sprays from severed limbs and heads.  It's disgusting, distasteful, and senseless.  I highly recommend that you DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
B00BEZTMWW|4|I recently read J. R. R. Tolkien's &#34;The Hobbit&#34; to my daughter as a bedtime story, and, as I book that I started reading as a child and put down because I found it boring, I rather enjoyed as an adult.  The story is often considered children's literature, but there is much, much more to Tolkien's story than a simple adventure.  A lot of the humor and social criticism is lost on anyone not old enough to understand what he was trying to say.  And it truly is an excellent story.<br /><br />With that said, my wife really wanted to go see &#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&#34; when it was in the theaters.  However, she was rather pregnant at the time, and we never wound up making the trip.  After convincing her to do a 3-day &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; marathon, she wound up really enjoying the story as well as the individual movies.  Therefore, I pre-ordered the Blu-Ray 3D/Blu-Ray/DVD + UltraViolet edition, and we waited anxiously for it to arrive.  With the story fresh in my memory, I was curious to see how Peter Jackson would take a 200-plus page novel and turn it into a 3-film epic.<br /><br />Over the years, I've heard many complaints about the liberties taken with &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; in how the story was told from multiple perspectives.  My response to these complaints was to wave my hand in dismissal and remind the complainer that they have to give some leeway when taking an established novel and interpreting it into film.  Liberties HAVE to be taken; it's almost always how it goes.  With that said, I had a hard time swallowing a lot of what was filmed for &#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.&#34;  I may be blowing things out of proportion here, but only about half of what happened in the film was actually in the book.  A LOT of liberties were taken with the making of this film, and I can only imagine how much additional material will be added to the following two films.<br /><br />Saying that, the film, in and of itself, is an enjoyable experience.  If you're a long-time fan(atic) of the original novel, please accept this film as an &#34;interpretive dance&#34; version of the pre-&#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; universe as a whole.  If you've never read the novel, please, by all means, watch the film.  Just understand that the book, if you decide to read it, is a rather different animal.  And if you have no intention whatsoever in reading the book, chances are you'll love this film, especially if you love the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; films.<br /><br />In conclusion, I could have done without all the liberties taken with the story to make this a 3-film epic like &#34;The Lord of the Rings.&#34;  It was a bit much for me, and, as someone who has minimal background in the world of J. R. R. Tolkien's Hobbitverse, I have no clue where it all came from.  My only guess is that these films will be the last Hobbitverse films made, so they're trying to cram in as much material as humanly possible.e experience.

B00D7Z4GQY|3|Pretty decent summer beach book, especially if you're an emotionally engaged, relationship oriented person who is struggling to find the right direction in life.
B004ZY0VHY|4|I wasn't too keen on reading letters all through the book.  But about 3/4 thru I was understanding why it was that she was writing in this manner.  I understood she had to write her feeling like a diary because she couldn't express into words how she really felt.  This book was good.  I enjoyed it alot.  I have seen the previews for the film.  I am not sure the film will hold up to the book, but....what film does.
B000002MIF|5|Released in 1984, between the Smiths' self-titled debut and their second proper studio album (Meat Is Murder), Hatful Of Hollow is a sort of compilation, focusing on non-LP tracks recorded by the group in the earliest portion of their career. The album features two singles (\\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" and \\"William, It Was Really Nothing\\") that were released in '84 but didn't appear on the debut. Also on board are their accompanying B-Sides (\\"Girl Afraid\\" for the former, \\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\\" and \\"How Soon Is Now\\" for the latter). The other featured studio track is the original single single version of \\"Hand In Glove,\\" which is noticeably different to the more well-known album mix. The rest of the album is composed of live-in-the-studio recordings that the group made in 1983 for BBC radio.<br /><br />Although it's a mere compilation, Hatful is often seen as one of the Smiths' finest records. Some fans even put it at the very top of their canon. This sort of thinking is understandable, since this album is one of the few places where listeners can experience the band's phenomenal power as a live act. The radio recordings are nervy and raw, allowing the group's emotional drive and sense of pop song-craft to shine through with blistering immediacy. On songs such as \\"What DIfference Does It Make\\" and \\"These Things Take Time,\\" the music reaches a level of intensity that puts their studio counterparts to shame. Same goes for the annoyingly rare (and undeniably brilliant) \\"Handsome Devil,\\" and the sullen roar of \\"You've Got Everything Now.\\" \\"This Charming Man\\" isn't the flawless pop gem that its studio counterpart was, but it's still full of gorgeous, hypnotic urgency and yearning vocals.<br /><br />The studio recordings are also fantastic- \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\" is one of the group's very best singles, a wistful slice of emotive (and quietly sarcastic) self-pity, with a beautiful guitar line and majestic vocal arcs. \\"William, It Was Really Nothing\\" is a dark, shiny burst of 80s decadence. \\"How Is Now\\" is, deservedly, one of the group's best-known songs. It's an epic, apocalyptic anthem for shut-ins, outcasts, and loners the world over. \\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\\" is painfully short and achingly sweet, while \\"Girl Afraid\\" features a really cool guitar part.<br /><br />All in all, Hatful Of Hollow is an undeniable classic. The only real misfire is the awful version of \\"Hand In Glove.\\" The song itself is brilliant, of course, but the bass-heavy mix and badly treated vocals taint the song beyond belief. Thankfully, there are plenty of places to get the vastly superior album version. Get this record for the other fifteen tracks.

0440418569|3|While this series is well-written and engaging, as a parent and educator I wish to caution parents and teachers alike that Pullman's expressed aim in writing this series is &#34;to undermine the basis of Christian belief.&#34; This is not clearly realized until the second or third book when the reader is already engaged in the story line. It is not merely an anti-Christian book, it is an anti-GOD book and buyers should be aware of this. I read the series and enjoyed it immensely, but when I understood the basis of the story, I felt like I had been manipulated by this author and the publishers' agenda. To have this available to kids in some school districts could cause trouble from parents. As a teacher, I would definitely get parents' informed consent before allowing students to read this in class. <br /> <br />Philip Pullman quote: &#34;We're used to the kingdom of heaven; but you can tell from the general thrust of the book that I'm of the devil's party, like Milton...The king is dead. That's to say I believe that the king is dead. I'm an atheist.&#34; &#60;[...]

B001PPLIFU|5|QUANTUM OF SOLACE<br /><br />**** ½ Out of 5<br /><br />Release Date- November 14th, 2008<br /><br />Running Time- 106-Minutes<br /><br />Rating- PG-13<br /><br />Screenplay- Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis & Robert Wade<br /><br />Director- Marc Forster<br /><br />Starring- Daniel Craig, Olga Kurylenko, Mathieu Amalric, Giancarlo Giannini, Gemma Arterton with Jeffrey Wright and Judi Dench as M<br /><br />Quantum of Solace is the 22nd film in the Bond franchise and is the first direct sequel of the series. If you haven't seen Casino Royale I'd highly recommend you see that before this one since you might be a bit lost while you can still enjoy Quantum of Solace seeing the previous one would be wise. Casino Royale was the re-launch of the series and Daniel Craig was the new James Bond. A lot of people were unsure at first about Daniel Craig, but many hailed him as the best James Bond and Casino Royale was hailed as one of the best films of the series. Quantum of Solace as received some mixed reviews from the Bond fanatics.<br /><br />While I do enjoy the Bond movies I'm more of a casual fan, but I gotta be honest I thought Quantum of Solace was excellent. Actually I liked it slightly more than Casino Royale. While I'd say Casino Royale was the overall better movie my only complaint was I felt it was a little too long and it started to get a little sluggish with the pacing at times. I still liked the movie a lot, but just felt it was a little longer than need be. Like I said I'm more of a casual fan, but Casino Royale really got me excited about the Bond movies and Quantum of Solace for me didn't disappoint at all. The running of this movie was a lot shorter and I felt it benefited from that since I didn't find it to drag at all.<br /><br />The screenplay by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis & Robert Wade was overall very well written, but I do feel the plot could have been set up a bit better; the only other problem I had were the villains and I had the same problem with Casino Royale as well. The Bond flicks are known for their villains and I just felt in the last two of the series the villains were under developed and a bit forgettable as well. The rest of the characters were fairly decent. Bond and M are the best written and I really like the new direction the James Bond character has gone. Overall the script was solid, but I felt the plot structure could have been a bit better.<br /><br />Director Marc Forster has gotten some mixed reviews from the fans, but I thought he did a great job for the most part. The pacing of the film is excellent and there are plenty of action sequences to keep the viewer entertained. The biggest complaint Quantum of Solace has gotten is for the use of the shaky cam, but it really wasn't bad at all. You can actually see what's happening and I wouldn't say Forster uses the shaky cam, but there is camera movement. Forster's choice of quick edits though is suspect. While I didn't dislike it as many seemed to that would be my only problem, but don't worry it's not like the Saw flicks or anything. But Marc Forster does a great job with the action scenes, which in my opinion are some of the best of the series.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace gets off to a quick start with the very first scene being an action scene and I thought it was great, that's where the quick edits really come in, but it wasn't bad and I felt the scene was exciting and well done. The rest of the action scenes are excellent and thrilling. Again I'm more of a casual fan so I suppose my opinion won't hold as much weight as the more hardcore fans, but I don't really understand why this has gotten so many mixed reviews. Forster does a bang up job and creates some memorable action scenes.<br /><br />In my opinion Daniel Craig is the best James Bond to date, while there are still some traits of the old James Bond, this Bond is a bit darker, grittier and angrier and that's why Craig is my favorite Bond. While Daniel Craig's Bond isn't as charismatic as thepast he really isn't meant to be. I like the darker and colder edge Daniel Craig brings to Bond. Some people compare the new Bond to Jason Bourne and even Jack Bauer and I can see why. But again I like the darker and angrier Bond and Daniel Craig is brilliant in the role. Every time I write a review for an action movie my complaint is always the action star really lacks compared to the past ones, but Daniel Craig has all the makings of the next great action superstar. In an era of really poor action stars and the good ones like Jason Statham doing really poor flicks Daniel Craig is getting it done and getting it done the right way.<br /><br />Olga Kurylenko is the latest Bond girl and she's gotten some mixed reactions, but I actually liked her character. While she does lack a little depth, I thought Olga Kurylenko delivered a mostly solid performance and she is just total hotness. I think I'd rate Olga as possibly the sexiest Bond girl. Judi Dench like always delivers an excellent performance and Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene is solid as the main villain, but he's never really given much to work with.<br /><br />Overall I thought Quantum of Solace was an excellent entry into the Bond franchise the action scenes are great and Daniel Craig was brilliant again in the role of James Bond. While the plot could have been set up better and more could have been done with the villains I have no real complaints and Quantum of Solace makes for a really fun viewing.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release is top notch with a great transfer and awesome sound quality. The features though are decent with some behind the scenes footage. Odds are there will be a better release down the road, but while the features lack the picture and sound more than make up for it.ome people compare the new Bond to Jason Bourne and even Jack Bauer and I can see why. But again I like the darker and angrier Bond and Daniel Craig is brilliant in the role.

B00K7ED54M|5|An extremely insightful view of the worlds history from a sociological perspective, the book is also entertaining and easy to read. I would recommend it.
B00KWGRKFU|5|This Is All Yours is a true album. There is a general theme to all of the songs, except for Left Hand Free, fit into. The music is deeply emotional and it is the kind of album that takes a few listens to comprehend. Once the music and the meaning sink in, then the true beauty becomes apparent.
B00CWY76CC|5|This game is really entertaining. It keeps you searching how to escape. I love it. All of the little puzzles are fun to figure out and it's great getting to the next room.

B002XHN776|5|30STM first CD was decent and I liked a few of the songs but found the lasting affect no where to be found. This Is War has taken their music to another level and I was knocked off my feet by the effort that you can clearly see went into this, simply by listening to it. Most every song is 5 or 6 minutes and few songs on the CD are sub par. Definitely will jump very close to my number 1 album of the year and I can see my self listening to this for a long time. Also FYI the production is really great on this CD, but not over done, so definitely try to give it a spin on a really high quality stereo system or some really good headphones.
B009FZHYKU|5|A friend recently got me hooked on The Walking Dead so I had to get caught up on all the reasons I'd missed and the majority of season 3. It just keeps getting better!
0553573403|5|Rarely have I been more riveted to a book.  I even dreamed about the characters when I'd put it down for the night.  Martin's world is vividly frescoed across his epic tale.  This is a high fantasy in its complexity, but grittily realistic in its medieval setting.<br />I was impressed by Martin's restraint.  He doesn't linger on any topic gratuitously as so many authors are prone to do.  Sex scenes, war scenes, love scenes, and descriptions will never make you groan, as they are all described with just the perfect portion of words.<br />There is a character in this book for anyone to relate to.  My particular favorite were Jon Snow - the Stark [guy] who pledges himself to the austere life on the Night's Watch, a near-monastic order that guards a Hadrian-like wall from the savageries of the  north.  I also enjoyed the tomboyish Arya - a noble-born girl who learns to swordfight with or without her father's permission.<br />I am not one for battle scenes, but I enjoyed this in this book.  Also, complex politics can bore me in a fantasy novel, but they are so well-done that I enjoyed these sections as well.  Normally, if a book has a chapter on each character as this one does, I will dislike some characters and want to skip their chapters.  However, each character's story is so interesting in its own way that I didn't want to do that this time.<br />In short, read it.

B005ZOBNOI|5|THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, narrated by Hazel Grace Lancaster, who is suffering from stage IV metastatic cancer, meets Augustus Waters in a teen cancer support group. The sixteen-year-olds share witty, intelligent banter as they get to know each other. This isn't about living with or dying from cancer, although cancer looms with the characters--Augustus lost his leg several years prior and Hazel uses an oxygen tank as her cancer has spread to her lungs. This is a story of two people who, although cancer has shaped their adolescence, are as typical as any teen with a challenge (and most teens have challenges sometimes big like cancer, sometimes more ordinary like insecurity).<br />THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, though classified as young adult, is not just for teens. I'm an adult cancer survivor and I saw myself and my survivor friends in Hazel and Augustus--we're funny, often irreverent about our cancers, as both a coping mechanism and a way of life, because frankly, life is better that way.<br />Though at times Hazel sounds older than sixteen, she's taken her GED and in college, plus cancer seems to mature children as they are surrounded by adults during treatment, family and the medical community.<br />There is little FAULT in THE FAULT IN OUR STARS.

B00004X01U|4|Selling out is not Madonna's thing. <br />When I'm listening to Music it  makes me think that this again, is a very 'new production'; showing it off  without teaching me a single thing. Re-inventing without re-discovering. I  don't think Madonna wants me to believe in her at all, because she knows  how much I'm living to tell her something to remember. <br />Music is the  place where that lucky star is alone, up on that mountain, swimming on the  surface. The music starts as a storm like ray of light and lifts her  further up that hill. It falls down again because she deserves it. Love  must feel amazing in the end, but nonetheless this Music is gone before you  know. <br />Music is a paradise enabled to balance on different platforms,  with Cher-like, Bjork-like voices, but still this thief of hearts is in  there alone, as a beautiful stranger with a cowboy hat. Intimate but  unreachable, sad but dancable, for friday, not sundays, for everybody to  cherish. Give her one more chance.  <br />At least now I know what it feels  like for a girl.
B005UKK4Y2|1|We could only endure 22 minutes before ejecting this non-funny movie. We usually don't have issues with the occasional raunchy dialog but this was a little too low in the gutter for our taste. Definitely a let down :(

Ragged Glory will blow away any dust from  them.....

B00003CXCT|1|After reading some of these reviews I won't be purchasing this DVD collection. Fine...enhance an all ready great movie, but add it as a second version on the DVD. Disney did this with Beauty and the Beast. Why not here? This is almost as bad as colorizing black and white movies! <br /> <br />Fans are fans because of the original versions, why fix what isn't broken??  It's really sad and shameful.
B0041KVZ1I|5|my wife loved it
B000002H70|4|In my opinion this is the best Cure album.  The writing, music and production are all fantastic and it all seems to come together seamlessly.  Most of all, this album has loads of passion and desire so it comes across as very genuine to the listener.  It's almost always in my cd player and never seems to get boring. There are no real low points but for me, Pictures of you has to be one the greatest songs of all time.  The extended version on the album is soooo much better than the radio mix it's almost a completely different song.     To sum it up, it's a great listen for Cure and non Cure fans alike.
0316666343|5|I recently read this book.  I enjoyed it thoroughly!  I had a hard time putting it down, yet didn't want the story to end when I was down to the last chapters.  Sebold's visions of heaven and getting to know each character was a thrill.  For an easy and entertaining read, I highly recommend this book.
B003MC5N28|3|The book is ok and might have been groundbreaking in the 90's but it's not something that hasn't been seen 100 times before.  Totalitarian state...no emotions allowed...one kid bucks the system yadda yadda yadda.  A cool twist is that no one can see colors or hear music except for our main character and the Giver.  Think of the giver as a record keeper who holds the memories of the past and doesn't have to conform to the norms of society.  He lives alone, can read literature others are not privy to, and pretty much keeps to himself.  The main character is his successor and 'learns' the past that no one has access to or memories of in order to help society function as a whole in case something unique arises.  So eventually the kid has enough and...well you see when you read it NO SPOILERS!!!  If I read this 20 years ago I would've thought much more of this book, also I have no intention of reading the sequels.
B00IIJ9F2E|5|can't go wrong with steelbook blurays
B00C7KYXHW|5|A very intelligent show. Not for the squeamish. Great cinematography, great music, and great actors. What more do you want?
B00BVYLBP2|5|I was surprised. The story line was different and full of surprises for me. I liked the actress. She did a wonderful job with so many characters. The gay guy adds lots of interest. Funny too.
B0036TGSIK|5|Excellent, well written, well executed, and well acted film.  A high school story that is entertaining what ever the crowd.
1423151054|5|Absolutely fantastic collection of work by the true masters. A great addition to the archive series of books.<br />Beautifully presented and worth every cent!
B004LSO6YI|5|This is one of the BEST Lesbian Movies I've seen. I mean yeah there's a little cheesy-ness in it (as with any Romance movie), but the storyline is interesting, both characters are endearing, the chemistry is palpable, and the love scenes are HOT... NOT a movie you want to watch with your kids in the room! ;)

B005DD7H50|4|Great movie, good premise.
6305750750|4|As I strolled through the Regency 20 theaters on May 22, 1999,(with a jumbo pack of Twizzlers and large Sprite, my standard movie going fare) my anticipation was high. My imagination was filled with child-like delight.  My eyes twinkled like the prom queen's...ok, maybe that's more than you  NEED to know, but nevertheless, I was positively enthralled with the chance  to view before my very eyes, Star Wars: Episode 1-The Phantom Menace. The  movie was, without a doubt, the most hyped and anticipated presentation in  cinematic history, prompting people to even wildly erupt in thunderous  applause when the 2 minute TRAILER was shown months earlier(I even heard  one person exclaim &quot;REWIND IT! &quot;)....But how would it stand to  the discriminating critique of Joe Lunchpail and Sally Housecoat? Judging  from the word on the street, you'd think this movie was more disappointing  than &quot;Showgirls&quot;. But the box office receipts say  otherwise...Personally, I LOVED the movie, but then again, I'm ALSO  inpressed by the savagery of vultures fighting over a raccoon carcass. The  movie was nothing more than an introduction to the storylines to follow.  No, you will not find any gripping and compelling dialogue, although I do  admit to being a little choked up when young Anakin(played so Culkin-like  by Jake Lloyd) has to leave his mother. Like many a movie, it is eye candy  du-jour, with it's lush vegetation, desert landscapes, and your standard  dogfights in space. And THAT is why this movie is fun to watch. You even  get to see the Jedi's preference of corpse disposal towards the end of the  movie. It has it ALL....While I'm sure that Episodes 2 &amp; 3 will be more  spellbinding and satisfying to those who prefer more Shakespere and less  shooting, this movie is more pleasing to the eye. We will see more bonding  between Obi-Wan(Ewan McGregor), and Anakin(which I pray to GOD will not be  played at any point and time by Leonardo DiCaprio), and hopefully we'll seemore of Mace Windu(Samuel L. Jackson, 'cause even in SPACE, there's gotta  be a brotha' throwin' it DOWN on the bad guys! )...But this movie is  DEFINITELY worth your while, even if to just hear the entrancing and  soothing sounds of a swinging lightsaber....
B009IJJ5B4|5|Good acting. Good chemistry between Holmes and Sherlock. Good script. Hard to compete against the British series but this holds it ground. Why we have to pay for it is another story?
B007SGM084|4|A story that captures you from the beginning. It made me wanting to come home from work and read the rest of the night. The only thing about the books that I found surprisingly dull was the sexual encounters between Christian & Anastasia after their first encounters. Granted this is the primary reason I was told to read this book, because of the sex, but after a while it became kinda boring. Besides the sex I felt the books contained enough of a story to keep me coming back to find out what was going to happen with Christian & Anastasia.<br />I would recommend these books not because of the sex but because I found myself caring about the characters.
B008Y2FRFO|5|a wonderful game to have when ur bored. its better then the fame's at the fair cuz there is no real money involved.
B000AU9UYM|5|In Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, we got to see the title character onscreen and in action within the first ten minutes of the film.  However in Batman Begins, Director Christopher builds the story slowly.  We are a nearly a full hour into the 140 minute film before we see the Caped Crusader for the first time.  This would not be the only contrast in this latest, and best Batman film.  What sets this film apart from any of the previous Batman films is the depth of character development not of the Batman character, but of the Bruce Wayne character.  By the time Joel Schumacher came out with his awful \\"Batman & Robin\\" the character of Bruce Wayne was nearly lost among a host of heroes, villains, and campy silliness.  Credit Christopher Nolan for taking Batman and Bruce Wayne serious.<br /><br />For the first time we really get a sense of what drives and motivates Bruce Wayne to become Batman.  Comic fans have known this for years but this was never conveyed with any skill or intensity in the previous films.  Here we see a man who has gone into seclusion, far from the rest of the world due to his inability to cope with his own fears and guilt over the murder of his parents years earlier.  Wayne is tutored under than hand of Ra's Ah Ghul a mysterious figure from comic lore, who trains ninjas to carry out their own brand of justice.  Wayne's difference of opinion with the oriental war lords tactics lead to a violent confrontation as Wayne escapes the mountain stronghold and returns to Gotham to find he'd been declared dead and that Gotham is infested more than ever with crime, led by organized crime boss Carmine Falcone.  Wayne is reunited with loyal butler Alfred played magnificently by Michael Caine.  Caine's Alfred is a more hands on character than we've seen in previous films, aiding Bruce in the development of the Batcave in tunnels found underneath Wayne Manor.<br /><br />Wayne also is aided by Lucious Fox (Morgan Freeman) the head of R & D at Wayne Industries.  Jack Nicholson asked in the first movie, \\"Where does he get those wonderful toys?\\"  Well the answer is from Lucious Fox who developed the body army, memory fabric cape, weapons, and the new Batmobile referred to as \\"The Tumbler\\".  He's kind of like Batman's \\"Q\\", and provides some much needed detail and backstory.  I mean even stalwart comic fans have always wondered if Batman came up with all this stuff on his own.  There's a great tip of the cap to Bob Kane's original Batman origin when Wayne encounters the bats in the caves and overcomes his fears and realizes that the bat is an image that will strike fear into criminals.  It's these little touches that make this movie so good.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is superb, too.  Gary Oldman plays an uncharacteristic normal and good guy role as office Jim Gordon, before he would become Commissioner Gordon as the lone honest cop that Batman trusts to aid him.  This very much stays with the canon created in the Batman Year One story by Frank Miller.  Cillian Murphy of \\"28 Days Later\\" is Dr. Jonathan Crane, a psychiatrist in charge of Arkham Asylum who also takes on the guise of Scarecrow, using a powdered drug to induce fear and psychosis into those who breathe in the drug.  Murphy fits the gangly scarecrow character very well.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan has contrasted the comic look of Schumacher and the Gothic/Art Deco look of Burton to present Gotham has a gritty, dirty, slimy cesspool, overrun by the criminal element and desperately calling out for rescue.  Lets also give kudos to the cinematography of  Simon Margetts and Wally Pfister.  The scenery was just gorgeous.  In the final summation this is really Christian Bale's movie.  He is Bruce Wayne.  He comes the closest by far, of playing the character the way he's always been depicted in comics for over 65 years.  We can only hope that Warner will continue to let this creative group continue to handle the Batman franchise.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonck Nicholson asked in the first movie, \\"Where does he get those wonderful toys?\\"  Well the answer is from Lucious Fox who developed the body army, memory fabric cape, weapons, and the new Batmobile referred to as \\"The Tumbler\\".

1591841216|5|Fast. Easy. Use it as a one-a-day spark or in-a-sitting jolt. Paul Arden reminds the reader that creativity and beyond the box thinking are not only necessary but also crucial in every type of situation, whether a person tends to think from the left or the right side of the brain.
B000ID37SQ|5|I always heard this movie was a classic and that I had to watch it and I always wanted to but never got around to watching but I'm happy that I took to the time to watch cuz it is an amazing! Highly recommended
B00GY0HJ4K|4|My best friend introduced this game to me and I'm slowly getting hooked. Lol. It's also a refreshing break from candy crush saga, where I'm currently stuck on a specific level for about a month now. I'm currently at Level 41 in this game. Had to spend my 70 coin to get past though.
B008QTV3X0|5|I love this show. Started watching this show's fourth season and my wife and I got hooked. We saw it was on sale on Amazon Video and bought the first season without hesitation.  It's now my smack for this summer. Yay.
B003XTYDMQ|5|Veronica Mars character brought back memories of Nancy Drew stories and TV show when I was a child.  Kristin Bell did a great job....
B00F8H0LM2|5|I have just about every Angry Birds version there is, and this is by far my favorite. I am also a huge fan of Star Wars, and I loved the first Angry Birds Star Wars. This is, without a doubt, way better. Plus, the Amazon appstore now offers a free version. This app is a must have for anyone who likes Star Wars or Angry Birds.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ The Pork Side (pigs launched at birds)<br />+ Tons of New Characters with Many New Abilities<br />+ New Features<br />+ Great Graphics<br />+ Awesome Music<br />+ Simple to Learn<br />+ Challenging Levels<br />+ Ability to Use Different Birds/Pigs (as you progress)<br />+ Telepods (purchased separately to load birds/pigs into game)<br />+ Free<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Advertisements<br />- Encourages IAPs<br /><br />Bottom Line: This is a GREAT app, I definitely recommend it. The new characters are so cool, I was so excited when I found that Amazon had released this app.
B00CBRAD2A|4|I have seen most of Arnolds stuff ,some behind the scenes video from when he was in body building.He made the most of the American  way,and got snickered along the way by liberal progressives,IMO.But a fun movie just the same.
B00AQL8VU4|1|Does not do what it says. No instant video. Followed steps, still no option to view movie. Terribly misleading!
B00BHMF578|4|Definitely an academy nominee.  Just the right amount of poetic license with the facts.<br />But probably should not have edged out lincoln for best picture.

B000E97HIA|1|[...] \\"3121\\" is dated, and the people who praise it are really praising Prince and NOT this actual record.  Prince hasn't done a great album in 16 years (\\"Graffiti Bridge\\").  \\"Diamonds and Pearls\\" was fluffy; \\"Come\\" was boring; the \\"symbol\\" album was tired, \\"the Gold Experience\\" sounded like RUST; \\"Musicology\\" was OVERRATED.  \\"3121\\" bored me to tears and it's true that he will NEVER do anything as great as \\"1999\\" or \\"Sign O the Times.\\"  Face it, the Short One's days are done!

Sounds like an 80's song, and the autotune sounds kinda funky in this song.<br /><br />But overall, this album is a MUST-BUY. Hands down, one of my favorites of all time.<br />Bon iver is amazing and so are the rest of their albums'.

1401216676|5|If you have ever read 'The Killing Joke' you probably think you do not need to buy this hardcover edition unless you're interested in owning a deluxe edition of a story you already know, which is the exact reason why I purchased it in the first place. Truth is, reading this hardcover edition not only adds to the experience but is in fact, a new way to experience the book.<br /><br />There are many reviews of the deluxe edition and all of them give it a lot of (well deserved) praise, but I see no mention of the differences between this edition and the original.<br /><br />For starters, there is a foreword written by Tim Sale (The Long Halloween, Dark Victory and the Batman Halloween Specials from the 90's) that gives a lot of background on how the story and the collaboration between Moore and Bolland came to be. Tim Sale also points out the fact that this edition has been re-colored in its entirety by Brian Bolland himself!<br /><br />The new coloring is simply stunning, I had read interviews in the past in which Brian Bolland had mentioned he was never quite happy with the final coloring of The Killing Joke; in fact, when he learned about a Deluxe edition being planned, he himself asked DC if they would allow him to color the whole thing from scratch. The tones he uses are paler to the ones in the original; the flashback scenes, originally in a yellowish tone that in my opinion worked well, are now black and white, pay special attention to red elements in the flashbacks as those are colored (that reminded me of the little girl on the red coat from 'Schindler's List') as a foreshadowing of the reveal of the Red Hood mask. Also, when comparing to my old copy, I found that this new edition has a cameo that was not in the original book, Oswald Cobblepot in one of the bar flashback scenes. It is amazing how the new color helps the story overall, the flashbacks are clearly differentiated now, and overall, Bolland has made The Killing Joke darker with the new color palette. Another change I noted is that the yellow oval from the bat symbol on Batman's chest was removed.<br /><br />An afterword by Bolland himself is included, where more details on the deluxe edition  are given and the idea of the Joker's origin story being one of many possibilities (as suggested by the Joker in the book) is reinforced. If this was not enough extra material, a colored version of 'An innocent guy', originally included in 'Batman Black & White' is also included.<br /><br />So, fans of the original and newcomers rejoice, this is not only a deluxe edition of the book we all know and love, it is Brian Bolland's definitive version of 'The Killing Joke'is that the yellow oval from the bat symbol on Batman's chest was removed.    An afterword by Bolland himself is included, where more details on the deluxe edition  are given and the idea of the Joker's origin story being one of many possibilities (as suggested by the Joker in the book) is reinforced. If this was not enough extra material, a colored version of 'An innocent guy', originally included in 'Batman Black & White' is also included.    So, fans of the original and newcomers rejoice, this is not only a deluxe edition of the book we all know and love, it is Brian Bolland's definitive version of 'The Killing Joke'

B001R10BMS|5|This is one of my favorite James Bond films, a stylish and mature take on the character that grows on me with each viewing. Sean Connery, who had quit playing James Bond for the second time after completing his sixth film &#34;Diamonds Are Forever&#34; in 1971, returns here 12 years later for one last fling at the role in a loose remake of his own &#34;Thunderball&#34; (1965) under a different production company. This 1983 film opened in the same year that Roger Moore played James Bond in &#34;Octopussy,&#34; doing comparable box office. One only needs to watch these two films side-by-side to see the difference between Connery and everyone else. Unlike later incarnations of James Bond, Connery plays Bond with the perfect mixture of stylish detachment and seriousness, being neither buffoonish like Moore and Pierce Brosnan nor too serious like Timothy Dalton and Daniel Craig. If you've never watched Connery's Bond films, you're missing out.  Connery always liked &#34;From Russia With Love&#34; (the second Bond film) best and despised the adolescent emphasis on gadgets and jokes that he felt overwhelmed his character by the time of &#34;You Only Live Twice&#34; (1967) and &#34;Diamonds.&#34; This 1983 film is his effort to &#34;do it right again&#34; one last time, bringing Bond back to the character-driven basics of the first two movies. Here he overcomes the film's downscale sensibility (so very different from what later Bond films became) with a great performance that makes this film (in my opinion) one of the best Bond movies, if not the best in the whole series. Like &#34;Dr. No&#34; and &#34;Russia,&#34; there is very little adolescent humor here, as Connery plays an aging spy called back into action one last time with self-deprecating flair. This Bond knows he is old, but intends to live his life to the fullest, and it's a pleasure to see a film that lets Bond get older after suffering through so many other stars (especially Roger Moore) who refused to let the character age or develop. And to put it bluntly, Connery is simply a better actor than everyone else who has tackled this role, which shows in his keen grasp of the human core of a character who seems on paper little different from the psychotic assassins he battles.   In this film Connery also gets excellent nemeses in Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max von Sydow, and Barbara Carrerra. Kim Basinger, Rowan Atkinson, Bernie Casey, Edward Fox, Ronald Pickup, Gavin O'Herlihy, and Alec McCowan make likable allies. These are easily some of the best actors to do James Bond, if not the best cast ever assembled for this material, but they also (with the exception of Carrerra, whose fun scenery-chewing stops just short of being too much) do it with realism under the sure hand of &#34;Empire Strikes Back&#34; director Irvin Kirchner. If your taste runs to the more adolescent and outlandish Bonds, you will probably not enjoy this film's jazz riff on an aging hero, but you'll love it if you're a fan of the original Connery films -- which, by the way, are simply better movies than almost everything that's followed. That's why the newer Bonds keep rehashing the originals.  Other than the prestige picture-feeling of &#34;Skyfall,&#34; &#34;Never&#34; is a cut above most James Bond productions in the quality department. From the director and technical crew to the cast, everything about it has a class that exceeds the EON Bond films. The characterizations are nuanced and complex, the humor organic to the plot rather than forced, and the gadgets in service of the story rather than dominating it. Most importantly it provides a classy &#34;farewell film&#34; for Sean Connery, who plays here an aging spy called out of retirement to battle evil one last time. Not only is it a better sendoff movie for Connery than the fun lunacy of &#34;Diamonds,&#34; but it's really the only proper sendoff movie that any Bond actor has ever received, even daring to let Bond retire(!) at the end. Other than the over-the-top Fatima Blush and a few brief but effective action scenes, the film resolutely avoids the cartoonish elements and over-the top FX of other Bond films, returning the series to its starting point as it sends off its original star with class.   Some viewers complain that this movie feels too much like &#34;Thunderball&#34; at times, but I really didn't notice it beyond &#34;Largo&#34; and &#34;Domino&#34; coming back. After all, *every* Bond movie follows a formula that recycles certain situations, feeling vaguely like prior films. (In one Daniel Craig film, they actually dip a girl in oil and lay her out just like a similar unlucky girl in &#34;Goldfinger,&#34; and &#34;Die Another Day&#34; is just a long assembly of greatest hits.) On the other hand, &#34;Never&#34; works so hard to create its own personality within the basic plot framework of &#34;Thunderball&#34; that it feels incredibly fresh, showing us new things like the tango scene and video game battle which are much appreciated for daring to deviate from the old pattern.   As for the continuity of this film with others, I must point out that the Bond films are so filled with continuity errors (i.e. Blofeld not recognizing Bond in &#34;On Her Majesty's Secret Service,&#34; one film after they had battled face to face as different actors) that it's impossible to watch them all straight through and feel it's quite the same series. There's also the retcon issues of Daniel Craig's films, which clearly reboot the series from the start with a new timeline. Over the years, I've realized that it's easiest to watch the Bond films by actor rather than by year, appreciating each actor's take on the character as a self-contained series unrelated to the Bond films of other actors. Watching the films by actor rather than in chronological order, it becomes clear that Connery's films (despite their ups and downs) have the best continuity and overall consistency of quality: If you watch all six of the Eon-produced Bond films and finish up with &#34;Never Say Never Again,&#34; you'll have a satisfying experience of an entirely self-contained spy film series.   After watching the Connery movies, you can decide if you want to watch Lazenby and Moore (best paired since Moore's films are the only ones which really acknowledge the existence of Lazenby's one-shot movie, even resolving its climax in the pre-credits sequence of &#34;For Your Eyes Only&#34;) and then Dalton, Brosnan, and Craig. The older I get, the less I'm inclined to watch the non-Connery films myself. Connery's stuff feels the most original; unfortunately, most Bond films after Connery feel like a copy of a copy of themselves.

I read it all the way to end because I kept thinking that something would happen to turn it around. I wanted to like the characters, but they never did anything to redeem themselves in my eyes. There were never any consequences for their actions, nor do you feel the characters desired absolution.

B0021L8UXU|4|Mad Human Disease: who knew it would take only one infected burger-bite to bring forth the annihilation of the entire country? For, as the hero of the story narrates, you cannot have a country without people, and there are no people left... Then, what do you do when you are the only one left alive? Well, you embrace denial, and HOPE. Convinced his parents have survived, our hero charges forth hoping to find them in Columbus, OH (well, more like, he walks away with a suitcase). He crosses paths with three other incidental survivors and they, HIGHLY reluctantly, form a unit. Living on borrowed time and weary not to bond with one another, they take on the names of their destinations. And so, we have our loner and hero Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg of Adventureland); the master redneck zombie killer Tallahassee (the brilliant Woody Harrelson, as always, balancing on the verge of sanity); a pretty con artist Wichita (Emma Stone of Superbad), and her 12 year old accomplice Little Rock (an almost grown up Abigail Breslin of Little Miss Sunshine).<br /><br />Self admittedly, the makers were influenced by the work of Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead). However, when considering to which other movies I could compare Zombieland, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle immediately comes to mind. As in that film, all Zombieland (human) characters are involved in a zany quest for their own personal holly grail, be it a luscious golden Twinkie for one, or an amusement park for another. For geeky Columbus, the holly grail of his life is a girl of his own. Unsurprisingly, he finds her in the tough chick Wichita (after all, choices are scarce for either one of them). Yes, they must battle hordes of naughty zombies to fulfill their quest, and do so in the most entertaining and hilarious fashion (to give you an idea, one scene involves a nun and a piano). But, zombie killing is secondary to the stories of personal journeys. Just like Harold and Kumar, while the World remains unchanged, each of our characters undergoes a transformation that forever (as short as that may be) alters who they are as a person.<br /><br />I can honestly say Zombieland is the funniest movie I have seen this year. As a comedy, it delivers more laughs then perhaps even Hangover, and can definitely be counted as one of the funniest zombie films EVER made. There is only one problem. Somewhere in the third part the film morphs from a zombie comedy into a romantic comedy. I was unprepared for that change of pace and somewhat resentful that the zombie centric fun was being taken away. Hence the four, rather then five stars. Still, I recommend the film wholeheartedly to anyone who desires a bit of innocent zombie gore with a high dose of humor and some romance thrown in...<br /><br />Enjoy!acters undergoes a transformation that forever (as short as that may be) alters who they are as a person.

This is a staple book in my yoga studio for use by my teachers. If you are a true yoga teacher, you should have this on your shelf to review as needed. I have used the book as references for contradictions and sequencing. Highly recommended!

1400095204|5|My first encounter with Chimamanda Adiche's work was last year when I came across her TED Talk \\"The Dangers of a single story\\". Since then I've read some of her collected shorts stories in \\"The Thing Around Your Neck\\" and even got the opportunity to hear one of her talks in person. My interest in her work has grown so of course I wanted to read one of her most acclaimed works so far: \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\"<br />Early on Adiche presents her principles from her TED Talk \\"The Dangers of a Single Story\\" as the story is told by three different narrators. Even though the narrators are connected, each is unique and comes from a different background. Ugwu, a young boy from a poor village is hired as Odenigbo's houseboy. Olanna, an educated young woman from a wealthy family and Odenigbo's lover. Richard, a british man who arrives in Nigeria as writer pursuing his interests in Igbo pottery and the lover of Olanna's twin sister Kainene. Between the characters there are differences in education, social class,family life, and even race but all three characters experience the upheaval and turmoil of the Nigeria in the 1960s.<br />Each character is unique from the others and their intertwined relationships makes a much more rounded portraits of the others. For example between part one and part two of the story there is large time gap from the early sixties to the late sixties. While somethings have remained the same, their have been dramatic shifts. Olanna now has a child Odengibo and the relationship between her and his mother seem to have improved. However there is hidden strain on the relationship that involves Richard and is not revealed until later and only hinted at through the three different perspectives.<br />What I liked most about this novel was how Adiche was able to balance the different narrators. Most of these character have something specifically driving them, and as time progresses, these characters change along with it. In just the first 200 pages of the book there are shifts already happening in the story. Ugwu starts as young boy from a poor village that begins to be exposed to an entirely different environment working in Odenigbo's house. Olanna, though well educated and very beautiful has self doubt and is initially attracted to Odenigbo's confidence. However  she is aware that her relationship with Odenigbo is still fragile and questions if they will last. When Odenigbo does cheats her fears are confirmed but the relationship still lasts. Richard, even before living in Nigeria has always felt like an outsider whether in his family or social circle. Richard begins to feel a sense of place when starts his relationship with Kainene but her aloof nature still makes him feel distanced from her. With Richard, even as he begins to feel like he's finding his place, he learns how to speak Igbo and is there when the Biafra movement begins to get momentum, he is still confronted by the fact that he is an outsider when Igbo people are killed right in front him but he knows he would not be targeted because he is white.<br />I found Kainene to be a very interesting character and rather deserving of her own narration because of her independence. She is a very aloof character and not fully understood by many of the character's such as Richard who spends part of the novel wondering what she really thinks of him. I would like to the POV of this character but I can understand why Adiche would choose not to give this character a regular POV like the others. It is the fact that other's cannot really know what she's thinking that makes her such an interesting character. She is first introduced by the fact that she and Olanna never talk to each other as they used to when they were children. Her sister, like the rest of her nuclear familiy, is described in at least one instance as a body of strangers. It is her distance that keeps Olanna and Richard reaching out to try and connect to her. Overall the characters are vivd and propel the novel.This is a great novel and well worth your time.
B00IMYZOBQ|3|Found the movie a little boring and slow.at times. I had to fast forward .. Great acting from Sandra Bullock.
B000Q6GUW0|5|exactly as billed great purchase
1780674880|5|This is amazing!
B00003CWL6|5|I was lucky enough to catch this film in the theater just before it went out, and lucky enough to make this one of the first DVDs in my collection.  Upon second viewing, I can only praise this movie more.  The acting by all involved is brilliant, and nothing is added in or left out in the way of plot or dialogue; this movie is absolutely seamless.  This is one you can't miss; Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey give the performances of a lifetime.  Run out and grab this one, it's worth every cent!
B002VECM4A|5|Well acted.  The movie reveals a person of strong character.
B004XISI4A|4|A little disjointed. To many characters - Ser this and Ser that... who can keep count?<br />Did not like the way this and the previous book are written on (about) the same time line.<br />However, it's a great story.
B0090SI4LU|5|Great movie.  Fast shipping .  Love watching.
B00994WQ78|2|Spaceballs, the movie, was considered by many to be a side-splitter back in the late 80s.  Mel Brooks is funny.<br />Watching it now, however, I find that the only time I was moved to even a smile was when Mel Brooks delivered<br />a couple of lines.  I didn't watch this movie in the '80s, but watched it recently because I wanted to see if it warranted the hype given when I first heard about it.  I suppose it could have....if you were watching it sometime in the year 1987 or so.
B0086HGW42|5|One of the best albums I've purchased in the last 6 months.  He writes his own music, plays guitar and can sing surprisingly well.  Gotta respect that combination.  Everyone in my household enjoys this album.
B0071XO8RA|5|I found this series randomly while browsing for a new book to read. I was immediately drawn into the world an characters depicted and I will be very sad to finish reading the series (which won't take me long at the rate the story keeps me reading!)
B005K0HDGE|4|Mr king doesn't disappoint. I kept wondering where he would go with the details around time travel. I highly recommend this book!
B00AFROVQC|1|i purchased this book thinking it would be a good fantasy, having just finished joe abercrombie's books (the first blade trilogy and the three subsequent stand alone books - i very highly recommend all of these).  in my opinion, this book is terrible.  it seems as though it is written for a child in middle school, but it was not advertised as such.  I may have actually enjoyed this book when i was about ten or eleven but it does nothing for me now.  i must warn you that i only read about a quarter of the book and then had to put it down.  i wanted to put it down after the first page but figured i would try to give it a chance since i had read a number of good reviews, but i could not bring myself to keep going.  i willingly admit that it may have gotten better throughout the second half, but this book is really not for me.  if you enjoy other popular fantasy novels like lord of the rings or a song of ice and fire, i do not think you will like this book.
B004SJ3BCI|5|Angry Birds is the best game in history as you see in the title, Angry Birds many five star ratings, and the many other titles.
B004H1V5RU|5|grandson loved
B0034G4OXQ|4|From my pov, this is a fairly good movie. The premise of the existence of a 'hereafter' is intriguing and this movie takes a unique approach, but it works only to a point. The script tells the story of three people whose lives will briefly intersect and carries the viewer through the process of what brings them together, but in the end it really doesn't make any attempt to answer the question of is there an afterlife and what happens when people die.<br />While I found the ending oddly plausible, it seemed to veer away from the main theme of the movie.<br />I gave this movie 4* because despite what I considered an uneven ending, it had an interesting script. The actors were very good as was the direction, the photography was stunning, special effects ranged from awesome to haunting, and the movie had a european feel to it. What kept it from being ultimately memorable was the somewhat low-key conclusion that wasn't completely satisying.
B0002NRRAG|5|Madeleine Peyroux hypnotized me with her rendition of Dance Me to the End of Love. I heard it on the radio. Wrote her name down wrong but was able to track her down because i remembered the Leonard Cohen song.  Ordered the CD and it did not disappoint. I have had it for over a decade and it still is a favorite.
B00LMFWMH6|1|It is a bad game not  recommended at all
B0012Q732O|5|[[ASIN:B0012Q732O 10,000 B.C.]]  I got this for my nephew who just turned nine. He thought the movie was awesome I thought it was pretty good myself.
B00F8L2VO4|5|a great tool. it not only teaches you to speak the language,  but also to read and write the languages you want to learn.
B00N35P5MW|3|I do like the game, but in just a few minutes I have been asked for a review 6 times! Way way way too much!
B00BSBR9N6|4|This was a fun book, read it very quickly.<br /><br />I enjoyed the humor and the interplay between the characters.<br /><br />My book club read and discussed the book this month and comments were overwhelmingly in favor of the narrative that monogamy is the only basis for a stable relationship: that Gene is a putz for initiating an open marriage and sticking with it, even when Claudia grew uncomfortable with it.<br /><br />What if the situation was reversed, if Gene had pushed for absolute monogamy and Claudia found herself stifled because she wanted an open marriage?<br /><br />&#34;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy...&#34;
B0043UGKAM|1|This series was recommended to me by a friend of a friend.   I'm a big fan of action and violence, but I couldn't make it 10 minutes before quitting this show.   The dialogue was laughable; the costumes ridiculous (what the heck was Spartacus (almost) wearing?);  the (massive amounts of) fake blood splatter looked cheesy, and detracted from what otherwise may have been some decent action.    Maybe it gets better after minute 10, but I'll never know.    Not recommended.
0385474547|5|Chinua Achebe's &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; works on many levels, a story of Nigerian tribal life before the colonization by whites, and the tale of Okonkwo, a tribal leader.<br />The prose is simple, yet descriptive in immersing the reader within the daily life of a village.  We learn the customs, see the people both struggle and prosper with their farming, and watch as Okonkwo rises to prominence within his group.  Determined not to become like his ne'er do well but well-liked father, Okonkwo is a hard worker, ambitious leader, but cruel to his family.  As the story unfolds, he allows his pride and sense of duty to tradition overcome what in his heart he knows must be wrong.  There is a moving portion involving an adopted son from a rival village where the reader suspects that a tragic outcome awaits.<br />Eventually, an accident, but serious transgression, results in his exile from the village.  Okonkwo remains determined to return and take his place among the tribal leaders, but then the white men arrive with their new religious ideas.<br />This is one of those books that you wonder about as your reading, until you've completed it and then realize you have to read it again to catch all of the ideas between the lines.<br />Okonkwo is a well-drawn character, full of strengths and character flaws that make this novel compelling.<br />It's a thinker.
B000OCXI3K|4|Reading Joanne Harris' Chocolat was doing the unthinkable: I was reading the book after I saw the movie, which is one of my all-time favorites, and I was reading a book a reviewer I really respect panned, and I have almost always agreed with his take on books.<br /><br />Like most reviewers, I found reading the book to be an entirely different experience than watching the movie. The book feels less like magical realism and more like a magically modified version of The Scarlet Letter. Take an overly conservative priest who believes the more he sacrifices the closer to God he will be and add in an atheist/agnostic candymaker who moves to his small French village and begins to sway the residents with her magic-imbued sweets.<br /><br />The narrative switches between candymaker Vianne's POV and that of he priest, Father Reynaud, in a seesaw between good and evil that at times seems overly simplified. Even the most oblivious reader will probably see where this story is heading long before the ending.<br /><br />Where Chocolat shines, however, is in the descriptions. While the plot may seem too simple, the lush imagery of the village and its eccentric residents as well as the mouth-watering treats Vianne makes in her shop leave the reader feeling as if the story is real and happening all around. Not since Laura Esquivel's Like Water for Chocolate have I been so hungry while reading a book.<br /><br />If you are hoping for a repeat of the movie, or a book that will keep you guessing, this will undoubtedly disappoint. However, if you are willing to look past the plot for vivid writing that makes you feel part of the action, Chocolat is well worth the time.
B00SH00N3Y|2|Good idea but a less than satisfactory story line. Full of cliches that left me bored and annoyed.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Best game ever.so fun and challenging at the same Time
B000001Y5J|5|If you can relate to feelings of isolation, abandonment, disgust, or outright self-destruction then this is the CD for you.  Trent Reznor seems to vividly describe the &quot;nicest parts of hell&quot; and pounds them  perhaps a little too close to home for some of us.  Broken is not for your  average person, but is definately a good CD.
0345803485|2|I admit, I bought it to see what the hullabaloo was about, I generally don't read erotica. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this book was soft porn done badly in ink. None of the main characters rang true, but I especially couldn't get into Anastasia Steele. She flip-flopped from the poor, inexperienced, let everyone boss her around girl to the spoiled brat with an even more spoiled 'inner Goddess'. Not only didn't I find her believable, I didn't like her. I never got the feeling that there was 'more' than what meets the eye and that facts and limp plot twists were merely a way to add words to an otherwise lacking story.<br /><br />I certainly realize that I am in the minority on this one, but I even went as far as to read the second in the trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker, just to see if I somehow missed something in the first book. Sadly, I didn't.
B009YMKL4A|5|Very good item and an excellent seller!

B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game it is so fun because I have always wanted a horse and this is so very realistic
B006ID6NDQ|5|Well written, the heart of this book reaches out to the reader. Knowing the outcome of this war, this book still manages to create suspense, fear and anger as well as hope. Mrs. Beer's written account documents the everyday horrors encountered by those fortunate to escape the concentration camps.
B00UN9PP44|5|Loved it
B00006690G|1|If a toothache could be released on record, this would be it. A disgusting, repetitious and foul-mouthed 'ordeal' that sounds much like an angry Lorikeet fighting with a 1987 Casio keyboard. <br />I often wonder how this 'noise' became so popular..but then again, when I consider that most of the people that stare and/or want to fight me are wearing some sort of silver/yellow Eminem item of clothing, it is little wonder. With such primitive instincts, one can hardly blame them for being led straight to this.
B0027MJU00|5|I enjoyed reading this book for several reasons, prime among them being the plot and the awesome way in which it unfolds. I read Gillian Flynn's &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and Amazon &#34;suggested&#34; this book. I don't regret the suggestion. It was a quick read and it was a page turner for me.
B004EPZ07K|4|This movie has gotten a fair amount of less-than-stellar press in various quarters, and it definitely has derivations from [[ASIN:B0006VIE4C Star Wars, Episode IV- A New Hope (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000UU4NE4 Spider-Man 3]], but I found it a not despicable example of the popular superhero-adventure genre.  Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is a test pilot for the Ferris aeronautical corporation and the son of a pilot who died before his eyes in a fiery explosion when Hal was just a boy (his two brothers think he wants to \\"be like him so bad, you need to die like him,\\" and certainly he does tend to take fantastic risks).  Following a hotdogging faceoff with a pair of drone fighters (his wing \\"man\\" is Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), daughter of the company's owner (Jay O. Sanders) and his girlfriend since they were kids), Hal is fired and suddenly finds himself scooped up by a ball of mysterious green energy which takes him to the dying Arin Sur (Temuerua Morrison), a member of the intergalactic police force known as the Green Lanterns.  Sur has crash-landed on earth after being attacked by a being called Parallax, a feeder on and embodiment of fear, who was once one of the Immortals who originated the Lantern corps; knowing he's doomed, he has ordered his ring, the source of his powers, to find him a replacement--and it's chosen Hal.  Hal himself isn't at all sure he's suited to the job, and neither is Sinestro (Mark Strong), a veteran Lantern who considers humans a young and primitive species.  But what neither Hal nor Sinestro knows is that the xenobiologist genius Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard), son of a powerful Senator (Tim Robbins) who's always considered him a disappointment, has been tapped to head up the analysis of Sur's body--and contaminated by a bit of Parallax's bioessence in the Lantern's fatal wound.  Hal tries to resign from the Lantern corps, but when he discovers that Parallax is threatening Earth, he knows he can't shirk his duty.  There's plenty of action and some fine SFX, but at the core of the film is the distinction between being without fear (which is what Sinestro believes Lanterns must be) and overcoming fear (which, Hal realizes, is the key to success as a Lantern and otherwise).
B008XX6J4C|5|I purchased this CD for a friend who had heard it on Pandora.  It is remarkable and beautiful all in one.<br />The musicianship is top rate and soothing.
B00AJAFNIA|1|What a coincidence that all of the positive reviews are either from the week of Jan 15 or today. Coincidence NOT! If you are going to fake reviews, at least try to be convincing. On top of that, this is quite simply spyware - install at your own risk.
1250012570|5|I loved this book.... great story. I relived my youth as I was in Middle School in 1986. I loved all the 80's references and enjoyed remembering the Walkman...<br /><br />In regards to the story itself.... I couldn't stop crying at the end... REALLY! I thought that it would end in a different way - I really HOPED that it would end differently (no spoilers - you'll have to read the story yourself)...
B00G21XNKU|5|OMG all the feelz! And in HD! I can't really think of much more then that...  It was epic to see the things with the stuff and so sad to know that thing with the timey whimy stuff and to know we where totally wrong for ever... I can't say much more then that because of spoilers!

B005NJU8PA|5|I hate cooking and, although I've long been *interested* in the way Tim Ferriss' brain works, I wouldn't consider myself a outright fan. The Four Hour Chef, however, has been a game-changer for me. It's a lot of fun and, in a lot of ways, not really about cooking. It's about rapid, targeted skill acquisition. It's amazing. Since I've started reading/doing, it feels as though I'm packing a s***-tonne more living into every hour. Thanks, Tim. Seriously.
B000FFJYB6|4|This is a great movie, but like most I didn't care for the ending of it. After seeing the movie, I read the book which the movie was based on. The movie takes a few liberty's, increases the importance of the other characters and some of the story line. In the movie, at the end, they show Willie getting on a bus heading for England. Skip is sitting next to Willie's parents. He gives his mom a hug and just gets on the bus, he doesn't pick-up Skip or doesn't say anything to him. There is no way that would have happened in real life. Willie knew he would never see him again. I read the book basicly to see how it ended, and it wasn't like the movie. I am not sure why they didn't use the books ending. I am only giving it 4 stars because of the ending.
0062060562|4|Perhaps your problem isn't so serious. This book allows you to feel how it must be to wake every morning, not remembering anything from your past.<br />The story gets tense when it gets dangerous when you can't remember.<br />Don't think we ever give the memory much consideration until we don't have it and we become almost an empty shell.
B0063IH60K|4|I love the one touch feature and after playing for a while the ads go away. Best free solitaire I've played.
B009EEL94Y|4|Ha Disney films have come a long way. Watched it with my ~5 & 7 year old daughters, and would def. watch it again.  Adventure, romance, family reunions, and cute animals - what's not to love? All star cast on voices, interesting bit of historical fiction (a lot more fiction than facts; think of it as a teachable moment :).  The sound track (though lovely) and animation is what date it the most, but it was refreshing to see old school animation.  There were bits that were a a little scary for my kids but nothing worse than the bear in Brave.

B00H9671DW|5|...and a cult favorite for auto enthusiasts. But don't categorize it as another car racing movie. That's the backdrop, but the story is interesting regardless. A great film.
B00008977N|4|Yep, the video blows.  I think what's going on here is that they had a 1994 4:3 film of the concert, and basically did a zoom and a pan and scan to \\"convert\\" it to 16:9.  That's why the video quality isn't that great.<br />But the concert rocks, and the sound is crystal clear.  Excellent 5.1 DTS, and I'm not sure of the complaints that I read that Paula Cole isn't loud enough.  Excellent mix.

B00EJU8ZIG|5|Truthfully it took me months to start liking Royals but I sampled the album and decided to but it.  I was very surprised how much I liked the entire work from start to finish.  I buy a lot of albums and usually move on to my new music each time I purchase more but this album I cannot listen to enough.  If you enjoy any of the released singles Royals, Team or Tennis Court, you must check out 'Pure Heroine'!
B00009UW0N|5|If you take an audience that never seen either Psycho or Halloween and had them watch both films, let's see how many screams per each film there are. Halloween like Psycho has a believible storyline where both characters could really exist. It wasn't until after the first film where Michael gets shot about a hundred times and still lives that the character isn't plauseable anymore. But, the pure terror that is given off by this faceless killer relentlessly stalking his victim is chilling, that when you leave the theater and get in your car to go home, you have to check the back seat to make sure Michael isn't there. Now that's what I call scary!
B00ES284TA|5|great

0770437400|1|The good: Plausible ideas about how governments might make Sophie's Choices about whom to save and whom to use as bait.<br /><br />The bad: All of the rest of it.<br /><br />An essential element of the plot is the notion that civilians would not notice that some people were eating some other people alive -- or that the cannibals looked like Honey Boo-Boo's mother after a bad sunburn and a case of MRSA. And that it started happening a lot more often every day, let alone that grandma did not stay dead.<br /><br />Instead, we must believe that the CIA/military/Spetznaz/Trilateral Commission/Illuminati/Elders of Zion could suppress this right-out-there-in-broad-daylight, more-ubiquitous-than-Starbucks-but-even-more-noticeable , bloody intestinefest from us because we are too busy helping our children with their homework and watching back-to-back episodes of American Idol on Netflix. And so no one would figure it out until it was Too Late. Don't try it. It causes brain damage.<br /><br />It only took one incident of human face-eating last year for everyone alive to hear about it, and see the video, even though everyone thought it was bath salts and not zombies. Google Miami and face-eating man and see what happens.<br /><br />Next in order: This book purports to be a series of interviews of everyone all over the world after the fact about what happened to them during the Zombie apocalypse. These people are supposed to be from all walks of life. But they all speak with the same voice and vocabulary. Anne Tyler, or John Green, he's not. And if he's trying for Studs Terkel's Working, he fails. Miserably.<br /><br />The other issue is political and you might not care: Does any rational Jew think that Israel would cede its eternal capital, Jerusalem, to anyone? Yikes!!
B00B2V66VS|5|I love this game I think its the bomb<br />and I think every one should have the chance to play this game.
B000I9YWDO|5|Funny stuff! You'll find yourself quoting lines with friends. Who hasn't had a run-in with a copier or a coworker with a crazy quirk? Hysterical!
B00004WNE4|4|If you liked the Zombies then you will like &#34;Odessey and Oracle&#34;.  If nothing else it's great to hear the original cut of &#34;Season of the Witch&#34;!  My recommendation is Buy, Buy, Buy!!!
6300151379|5|This is one of - if not the - most magically mastered fantasy movies ever made!  (and I realy know my fantasy movies!)       Definitely Jim Henson's masterpiece! PLEASE RE-RELEASE I WANT TO SHARE IT WITH MY KIDS!!!!!
B00FFERTUK|5|I bought this because it was on my Amazon list of &#34;if you liked this you might also like this&#34;.  While I was listening to the samples I was surprised how many songs I recognized but I didn't know who sang them.  Now I know.  I think I like every song on this CD and I'm sure I'll be buying another of their CD's soon.  Sometimes they remind me a little of Nirvana.  Not all the songs, but a few of them.  I don't know much about these guys but I know what I like.  Some of the songs are a little smutty but the music is great anyway.
B002QYSZBO|5|Witty and hilarious. Definitely a movie you can watch over and over again and have it still be funny. Can't get enough of Robert Downey Jr.
B004TTMYQG|3|I really like this calendar,  but wish it had a scrollable widget.  The TINY arrow buttons at the bottom of the widget are way too small to press to switch between days/weeks/months,  etc. If it had the scrollability of the GO Calendar Widget it would be a 5 star easily.
B0094M0DJS|5|I love the Movie and works great on the kindle cloud.  All I have to do is download to watch without WiFi ! ! ! when I am not able to contact with WiFi !
0062238868|5|Great! Got here quickly enjoyed the book!
B003EY7IRC|5|Yes, I really mean that. I am really too lazy to review most books and even though I've read tons of great series and books, my problem is I read the entire series in a week and by then I don't really want to review the individual books.   With that said, I came into this book with an \\"We'll see\\" attitude. I was probably one of a minority that was kind of wondering when the payoff was going to happen. It has been a long and winding road!  And that is a great thing! It's much more than a typical romance or paranormal urban fantasy, and amen to that! I will applaud the author tremendously, *SPOILER*, no way to proceed forth here and not spoil, so you have your fair warning: some of the scenes with Barrons /shiver! They are some of the best love scenes I've read, some of the best tantalizing teasers of what is to come and sexual tension in a series I've ever read and it was fantastic.    I'm suggesting this to all of my friends.   This was a fantastic finish. Moning really drags us through hell and back for a well earned salvation ;).
B000IZA9OE|4|Fun, irreverent humor.
B002GY9F9K|5|This order came to me quickly and in perfect condition. My most sincere Thank you, to the seller, very dependable,<br />Justkris
B00IG2DOKM|5|it's really fun and I think it's the best farm game and I love it so much and I don't think there is nothing that I don't like about it .
B004VQK9XW|5|It's amazing to me how these three guys get together and their music is so open minded and creative... I am sure there might be other out there that perhaps blow this away but have yet to be discovered.       I think this album is great from top to bottom. But not everyone is going to like it because they will not understand the concept behind SIXXAM the band nor their music... Inspired by things society scoffs at every single day as a collective... It's simple time to forget what we have been conditioned to feel, see and say and just do for oursevles... We can all find beautify in just about everyone and everything if we open our minds up to the reality of truth...
B0094BB4TW|3|I'm giving it a 3 just because I like Facebook but I wasn't able to download the free app.so I can't really judge the app.just judging the source.
B00COGXGNQ|3|Of course the books are always better but I just don't like how they don't follow the storyline. Might of enjoyed more having not read the book.
B00005JLEX|5|Seinfeld is arguably the greatest sitcom of all time by making a bold decision in making a sitcom purely about everyday stuff like Soup Nazis or \\"Friends With Privaleges\\" deals. In the first and second seasons the show changed television by, instead of making a show about spys or other ridiculous non-beliveable subjects, made a show about the every day human life which is essentially \\"Nothing\\"!!!! That is why seinfeld,whether about ridiculous food waits in chinese and other restuarants or about the sweet sweet taste of revenge, has still left a mark on television that can never be removed or copied, which is proof that Seinfeld, the smartest,cleverest,and possibly funniest, sitcom of all times is still just as relevant...
B00005JKCH|5|i've never seen a better superhero movie like this one for a long time. he goes to the museum with his classmates, he gets bitten by a spider that excaped from it's container, and bites him on the hand. later on he goes home and faints. then he wakes up the next morning and he is way stronger than he was and that he didn't need to wear his glasses. then he meets his best friend's dad who turns out to be the evil nemesis, the green goblin. i just love the story line. i don't know why some people hate this movie. what is there to hate? the only thing to hate is some of the actors they put in. like that guy who does the newspaper pics. they could've gotten somebody better.
B00005QGAX|5|One phrase describes this album. \\"The best album of all time<BR>\\". Every song on this album is worthy of being a #1 hit.<BR>Including the bonus tracks \\"Streetwalker\\" and \\"Fly Away\\".<BR>All of Michael Jacksons best music was when he was working<BR>with Quincy Jones. While all his new material is still very<BR>good, his work with Quincy has always been the best. This <BR>album is better than most artists greatest hits albums. It's <BR>like a greatest hits album within itself, just like \\"Thriller\\"<BR>and \\"Off The Wall\\" was. If you haven't bought this album you<BR>are really missing out on something special. Trust me.
B00006JJ1O|5|This album is what we need in music today.  Not that pop or rap that we've been unfortunate enough to listen to day after day. The same songs are played on the radio, over and over again.  It's maddening. <BR> T.A.T.U is bringing a whole new sound to the table, I call it rock/techno, it has great drum beats, and this catchy sound you just can't deny.  So all in all, its a great CD, its lyrics are perfect with the music.  I give it two thumbs up.
B000002JS8|4|With this 1979 release AC/DC proprelled themselves into heavy metal royalty.  The follow up release &quot;Back in Black&quot;, a bit better than this record only solidified that lofty status. On this record, singer Bon Scott's last, AC/DC demostrates a keen sense for killer riffing and solid songwriting.  As usual Angus Young guitar playing shines, with whiplash solos and crunching riffs.  My favorite track is &quot;If you want blood&quot;, a headbangers anthem with some of the best riffing this side of Led Zep. Of course the title track and &quot;Touch too Much&quot; are exemplary tracks as well.  All told a very solid release - highly recommened!!!

B000T5O48U|5|I have always said that the most frightening films are those that use normally, loving objects to scare you senseless!  Cujo is a film that does just that.  Cujo at first, was a normal, loving, family pet. Yet the writer turns this docile, likable animal into a creature of most of our most dreaded nightmares.  If you have a weak heart, make sure that you have plenty of heart medication on hand before you watch this film!
B0000VAFO0|1|If you enjoy watching black leather-clad morons spray trillions of bullets around, skip this and see _The Matrix_ again. If you like the concept of an updated vampire movie, see _Blade_ again. But at all costs skip this waste of a DVD. Unless I fell asleep during a key exposition sequence (which is possible), I could not make sense of the vampire mythos in this movie. Vampires - immortal creatures - need 'awakening' (resuscitating)? Are they just too lazy to deal with the day-to-day drudgery of immortality? Vampires can faint from *blood loss*? Vampires need CPR after near-drowning events? (Ask yourself during this scene: isn't drowning, being defined as a suppression of the oxygenation of blood, really more of a problem for the living than the undead?) Advice to the Lycans: skip the expensive UV bullets, hit the Home Depot, and attack the vampire HQ with $59.99 chainsaws. Even better, just flood it using $9.99 garden hoses. Worth seeing for a number of laughable sequences, including one in which Beckinsale expends about 1,100 rounds from two handheld automatic pistols to create a Looney Tunes-style hole in the floor to jump down through. (I can suspend my disbelief of Hollywood clip sizes unless I have a scene like this shoved in my face...); also to hear grown people discuss the Lycans in abject fear, although if you're just sitting down to this movie with a bowl of popcorn, you might, like me, hear 'lichens' in your head. (&quot;The lichens! My god, the lichens! They're...slowly growing on mountainside rocks!&quot;) Beckinsale in leather is the only redeeming quality. Keep the rest on 8x FF in your DVD player.
B0032CVAQQ|4|After reading this book i realize that The 5 love languages apply to all relationships. This is great insight for any individuals.
B00COGY2P2|5|Hard to find good action/mysteries.  This was a good one.  Well worth it and would highly recommend to anyone out there.
B00006RAKP|5|There's no way you can reduce Elton John's career to one cd and do it justice. So we have this beautifully remastered collection of hits on two cds. The first cd is devoted exclusively to Elton John's Greatest Hits from the 1970s. This is all right, because many of Elton's long time fans will agree that this was his most creative and prolific period. You get Bennie and the Jets, Crocodile Rock, Honky Cat, Good bye Yellow Brick Road, Philadelphia Freedom, and much more.    The second cd starts out with a few hits from the 70's, and then covers the 1980s comeback and the 1990s Disney film hits such as \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight.\\" It concludes with This Train Don't Stop Here Anymore, which recalls Elton's musical style from the 1970s. It is a fitting closure to a wonderful tour through John's career.    I have two very minor quibbles: One: I would have liked to have seen Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters, Border Song, Last Song, and Madman Across the Water on here, but I realize that there was no room and that these songs can be readily downloaded off of the Net. Number two: Honky Cat and Saturday Night's All Right For Fighting are presented in slightly edited versions (the songs fade out earlier than their original incarnations).    But these small complaints aside, this is the best collection of Elton you can buy, with the best remastered sound.
B0087EACJK|5|Fun game, good time killer.
B0089LOG02|3|if it's not a recommended young adult book it should be
B00E89VXQY|5|The movie was gone from theaters before I could get out to see it.  This CD is excellent and will tide me over nicely until the movie is out on blue-ray.
B00G32TD98|5|Yup, scary that's for sure, if you want to be scared, by creepy stuff, and shocked when the creepy becomes in your face, then the conjuring is for you. This is not a gory, slasher movie, which thrives on guts, blood, and new ways to decapitate the cast, Its a mix of well written characters and exorcist style demonology creepy malevolent evil, to keep you up at night. NOT FOR KIDS, like I needed to say that.
B0012HF5NC|4|Will was excellent in this. The movie is all an American movie can be. I loved it it. Witch is why it is in my libary
B001UGB1X8|2|Thought I'd give this movie a look as it has two of my favorite lead types John Goodman and Tommy Lee Jones. It was however a poorly written screen play that never should have gone to production. This was on top of some poor editing and generally sub-par direction. I'll look a bit closer next time and not just trust the prior work of good actors. The only highlight in the film comes near the close where some good tension is built around the disappearance of a character. This doesn't last though and the rest of the film is a let down.
B000021Y7X|5|Rock n roll doesn't get much better than this.  If you are playing this at a party and nobody's dancin', throw everyone out 'cuz the don't have a pulse.
B00B2V66VS|5|I love this game its hard but awesome. love it love it love it by aliyah Lynn Mccoy. love it
B0088P2A7A|4|Have used this app on several occasions and have found it useful.  It is a keeper......a fountain of knowledge.  Glad I got it.
B00APUQJLO|1|Im sure this movie appeals to some people but it was definitely a drag for me and my husband.. we watched the entire movie to give it a chance but never got into it. very boring and slow. kept waiting for it to pick up and it never really did
B002RBZ13Q|5|Unbeliveable!!!!!!!    a must for any fan..  by far the best concert i have seen..  I love the backstage footage you get to see.

B00881VLCE|5|There are many more free puzzles you can get too.  Great time killer.  Skip the easy level and go straight to the harder ones.
B00EFWU91E|5|Very good book! Literally do not start this unless you have time to not put it down. I was addicted to this book & was very happy with how Cassandra spun everything...per usual. Can't wait for whatever else is coming!
B004JN1CW4|4|I can't seem to review this book without giving a few major things away, so if you aren't a fan of spoilers you might want to skip this review... I am a disgustingly fast reader, and I read all three of these books within 2 weeks. The first two were intriguing and captivating, but by the start of this third one, I was exhausted. These poor kids are just screwed over and over and never seem to catch a break until they break out themselves, but even then they are tracked and followed by WICKED. I was hoping that by this book these kids would have discovered something useful or that their breakout would have stirred something bigger, but it just seems like the same ol' WICKED routine. Also, the concept of this last book seemed a little far fetched, with WICKED needing to kill of Thomas in order to succeed.. I guess I just felt like the science fiction began to wobble in this third book because there was no possible cure for the Flare. Any way, I still enjoyed this book but I was happy it was over and slightly disappointed with the way it ended even though the ending was super exciting. I guess I could see this book having a lot of different avenues it could take, and it took the same avenue as the last two.. I was hoping for some curve ball events. I also am attempting to read the prequel: The Kill Order and I just can't do it. I'm getting sick of cranks and story lines that are too similar.<br /><br />SPOILERS OVER- BUT I STILL LIKED THE SERIES. If your young teenagers have nightmares, don't let them read this before bed, and keep an eye on their mood when reading because this series does have the potential to affect young readers who get too deep into the story. Reviews are important and I read them myself too, but this is a personal evaluation- if you're interested take a chance and see how you like it!
B000P0J0A6|3|One of my 1980's favorite movies, never gets old......good quality movie... Very joyful movie...wish I could have a real gizmo lol
B003JTHXOK|5|safe haven was a book that so many women lives ar like  being controled by there mate. But ther is hope out there just have to find the strenth and courage to move on.It was a very good book had alot of good suspence in it.
B00N1JQ452|5|Loved, loved, loved the movie.  Can hardly wait to see a sequel made.  Two thumbs up!
B00594XOZU|3|It doesn't notify me right when I get a message, wether my Kindle Fire is on or not (...I got this app for my Kindle Fire ....) I can't seem to find a menu for it though; for like, if you want to block users or something. But other than that then it's fine!

1451629184|4|I honestly don't know how to review this one. I was astounded, sad, overwhelmed, and depressed while reading. This poor girl went through so many horrible things. The book is written like a diary, not a novel or even biography. Which makes you realize just how real her story is. This book is very heavy, and somewhat depressed me. I am reading something incredibly light and fluffy after this one.
B00O8NPCA8|4|Entertaining
B0015DYIH2|5|Really enjoyed this book!! Sorry the story has ended. I want more!! THE AUTHOR NEEDS TO GIVE US MORE!! LOVED IT!!
0670025593|5|Such a fun read! She weaves a wonderful surprising tale!
B000002KIE|1|The Sex Pistols were a subpar punk/pop band. End of Story. Unfortuantly the media has hyped this album claiming it is \\"The Essential Punk Album\\", and the sex pistols fooled everyone by thinking that they were a rebelieous band. If you want some good Punk/Rock music, buy \\"London Calling\\", that's a real punk masterpiece.
B00I30RCZA|3|Predictable but enjoyable
B00003CXI1|4|I have seen the movie at movie theater. I like it very much, wish there are more like the book I read.    However, true that 2nd disk does giving trouble for people who do not know what to look for. Most people around me did not read the book or know how to solve/play the game. The company should have leave all 7 never before-seen-before scenes in the movie than on 2nd disk. OR They can make dvd with no game and dvd with game so that we can pick what we want.    Last of all, I am very disappointed that all 7 scenes do not have English subtitle! No closed caption/English subtitle for me to know what they were saying. I am deaf. I have found almost all of my dvd movies does not put closed caption/English subtitle for special features. They should. Any movie maker company should do that. It is not fair for me to \\"suffer\\" with lot of guesswork for 7 sceness- trying to imagine what they were saying.    All DVD movies I have said \\"closed caption\\" They did not appear on my tv or anyone's tv! I tried with different system and different tv. No such luck. I wish they should be clear if closed caption is English subtitle then PLEASE mark it clear! I personally doubt regular closed caption works at all. Three of movies I have with no English subtitle- they were labeled with closed caption- NONE! Totally waste my time with any movie's special features-\\"blind sound(voices, etc)\\"(don't know what to call it) for me.      UPDATE: And finally, 2011, I recently found out HP4 movie for PSP... I am so shock that it has NO CLOSED CAPTION NOR ENGLISH SUBTITLE!!! Seriously?!?!? I am deaf and I do really want to be able to enjoy the movie on my PSP (region 1) It is not fair for deaf people. I wish they would made all HP movie 1-7 with english subtitle for deaf (SHD) it is important for us to be able to watch/enjoy and understand the story. Please somebody do it for us. Thanks.

B000E1ZBGS|5|I am a huge fan of Jane Austen. I also read numerous books on Regency/Historical and Scottish Historical Romance. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are featured by many authors in sequels to Pride and Prejudice of which have given many insights to what different could have been a possible future for them if Ms. Austen had had a longer life to write such sequels herself. All were most enjoyable.
B001PPGAIA|5|I had heard some co-workers talking about it and decided to try it. I searched Amazon.com and even the price was better than in the stores in the mall. So if you're looking for an action packed movie with human interest and a love story combined \\"Australia\\" is it. I purchased it on 11/23/09 have enjoyed it over and over again (At least 4 times). Not to mention it is a tear jerker. I passed it on to my brother and he loves it too. So grab it I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
B002ZG98FU|5|I didn't expect too much from this movie but was pleasantly surprised. It made me long for more of this genre- a well written story with some good laughs. My wife and I hadn't laughed in a movie this hard in a long time. Hollywood, please keep producing movies like these!
B0013TTLDE|5|Kate Morton's novels are entertaining with good story lines, excellent  character development, and accurately depict the times. Truly enjoyed this book!
1932100660|5|One heck of an eye opener.  I had a hard time putting this book down & ended up thinking about it for MONTHS afterwards.  Amazing information on how your diet can really screw things up.  I HIGHLY recommend this book, it will make you think differently, at least for a while !
B000000OXH|3|Luis Mejia (son) - Asia marked an era of melodical new style of arena rock with their debut self-titled album, being the first supergroup of the 80's, but after the success of the debut, they tryed to keep up with the fame but just couldn't get along with this album.<br /><br />Alpha is a very nice album to hear, having great mellodies and beautiful escapist sounds that should be enjoyable for any fan or casual listeners, showing their habilities and experience of past bands, but the album retains a great lack of originality and complexity, they seemed to be blinded by their mainstream success and got lazy on this album; not a total failure, still. The music composition and the lyrics are a lot inferior, some lyrics even seem to be incoherent or ridiculous such as The Smile Has Left Your Eyes and I'll Do What I Want. Certainly the best tracks among the album are Don't Cry, which keeps a lot of originality, and The Last To Know, which is the tracks that has the most beautiful mellodies in the whole album. The two most famous songs in the album are Don't Cry and The Smile Has Left Your Eyes.<br /><br />Among the artists its to notice that Downes' keyboards dominate the whole record to the point of leaving behind all the other instruments. Wetton's voice is always nice to hear but he didn't make any vocal effort or stunning choruses. Howe's guitar is nice to hear but it appear only eventually in certain parts of the songs to add a little touch of power ballad and not leaving the music in simple synthpop. Palmer's battery is played in a very delicate but rythmical way. Downes and Palmer are the ones who dominate the album.<br /><br />In conclussion Asia gave a nice try within mellodies and electronical but sweet sounds but within that they got lazy; still I recomend it to any fan or casual listeners, the album leaves a good impression of the band.
B00KW3PLAE|5|This is the best game EVER
B0060Q962Q|3|Its an ok game but a little too basic
B003B02OOG|3|Some good short stories, and generally well written.  A couple of the stories were overly long without much substance to them.
B0084IHVGG|5|Bought this movie for my nephews and they loved it!  It 's a great movie to watch with the whole famiy.
B005JTAP4S|5|Wow! and Wow! This book is one of the most unique I have ever read, which is a huge compliment coming from this avid reader. There is nothing average or boring on a single page. The author's words were smooth as can be. It was such an enjoyable trip (it felt like I was two worlds down and around the corner from Alice in Wonderland). Think Alice meets the Wizard of Oz in Narnia and then some. It was an amazing ride. This story is about a boy named Peter who happens upon a great adventure from within a house of his mom's elderly friend. His trip takes him to a strange and intriguing land. The plot was wonderfully drawn and there wasn't a moment I was reading that I did not want to know what would happen next. (my daughter made us sandwiches for dinner, so I didn't have to pull myself away from the pages- and that never happens- I'm always the cook.). The book was beautifully detailed and fast paced, and being the fast reader that I am I had to slow myself down because I did not want to miss a single delicious word. I highly recommend this read, but be warned, this is indeed a darkened fairytale. I especially enjoyed the dark place of the trap, which I will not expound on because I don't do spoilers. If you are an adventure lover, or a reader who craves excitement in your books will love, love, love this one. I wish I could give it ten stars. Thank you William O'Brien for writing something so original. You have been added to my list of authors to follow.
B0009P42S2|5|Steamboy is the latest entry into the Steampunk subgenre, speculative fiction that presents an alternate historical setting of the Victorian era in which modern technological advances were invented earlier in history through the assistance of steam-era technology. Early fiction like Jules Vernes' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling's novel, The Difference Engine and Alan Moore's popular comic book, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comic book are perhaps some of the best known examples of this subgenre. Gibson's Cyberpunk fiction had a profound influence on one of director Katsuhiro Otomo's previous anime movies, Akira, one of the greatest animated films ever made. Steamboy sees him influenced by Gibson's fiction again as he wrestles with some of the same themes, such as man vs. technology that he explored in Akira while maintaining the same level of quality animation.<br /><br />Otomo's film explores the differing views of science. Ray's grandfather believes that only the fruits of advances in science should be available to the educated and the privileged while his father believes it should be shared with everyone as he says at one point, \\"Science exists as a power to be used in reality.\\" He believes it should be used to improve all of humanity, not just a small portion of it.<br /><br />Watching this movie only reinforces how bad The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen movie is compared to its original source material and the Steampunk genre in general. Steamboy is the real deal-a wonderfully nostalgic look at a bygone era mixed with a parable about the destructive nature of technology if put in the wrong hands and how it affects the relationship between a son and his father.<br /><br />\\"Re-Voicing Steamboy\\" takes a look at the Hollywood types who voiced the characters for the North American release. Anna Paquin, Alfred Molina and Patrick Stewart talk briefly about the film and their appreciation for Otomo with Stewart speaking the most eloquently about the time period that Steamboy is set in.<br /><br />\\"Interview with Katsuhiro Otomo.\\" he started working on the project ten years ago with actual production on the film itself starting seven years ago. Otomo found that doing a period film was a bigger challenge and more time-consuming than a futuristic one like Akira.<br /><br />\\"Multi-Screen Landscape Study\\" is an interesting featurette on the set design and look of the film but conveyed via three split-screens that show clips from the movie, vintage newsreel footage of London and footage of the film's creators talking about their movie.<br /><br />\\"The Adventure Continues\\" allows you to watch the artwork on display during the end credits sequence without the text obscuring it.<br /><br />\\"Animation Onion Skins\\" allows you to watch several sequences in various stages of development, from rough pencil sketches to computer modeling to the final product. This gives some insight into how much work went into this movie.<br /><br />Finally, there are \\"Production Drawings,\\" a montage of artwork for the film's setting that allows you to marvel once again at the attention to detail.the most eloquently about the time period that Steamboy is set in. <br /> <br />\\"Interview with Katsuhiro Otomo.\\" he started working on the project ten years ago with actual production on the film itself starting seven years ago.

B00006RIO7|2|now, this was a story written a long time ago. but it still falls flat. the songs are unemotional and stupid. the beats are too modern, now sounding like something that was trying to be a hip CD. the music was supposed to sound old and untouched. the lyrics can be funny, but are not top noch. if you need to listen to a good musical, listen to Moulin Rouge. Moulin Rouge was much better than Chicago. Chicago, in my opinion, was just trying too hard...
B00FAPF5U0|4|Playing this game on Facebook lets me compete with my friends. I am so competitive that when I play, it is sheer delight when I am top player.  Love Candy Crush!!
B00DQ845EA|4|A good reading, there are a lot of good practices in there, but lacks the rigurosity of a good book. Sometimes is easy to see how opinions are presented as rules, which might or might not work.<br /><br />But at the end of the day, that's what most business books are.
B00CKJ2KK2|5|Awesome Game
B002N14GPE|3|The movie has a very interesting twist.  I did not see it coming.  It's one of those movies that you want to hit someone over the head and tell them to stop bring stupid
B003ZSJ212|3|The added Vader \\"Noooo\\" at the end of Jedi was just horrible.  But then there are many things about the last third of Jedi that bother me.  I bought this edition for the deleted scenes and documentaries, but honestly the scenes are on youtube and the fan documentaries Star Wars Begins, Building Empire, and Returning to Jedi, all available for free are the best docs I've seen on the movies.   The new movies have some parts I like- all the Obi bits are good in my opinion, but I found myself fast forwarding through the \\"Annie\\" and Padme parts because I still find them horrible.    It may be my imgaination, but certain background elements in the old trilogy seem enhanced or added to.  Things have more color, or style, or come fancy holo terminal will be there when there wasn't one before, etc.  I would have been happy just getting the original trilogy on blu-ray.  The extras aren't worth it in my opinion.
B0076DCT2G|5|We own this in hard back & paper back. My husband accidentally bought it twice.  He read this book.  He rated it A+++.  He is a voracious reader & that is a very high rating by his standards.
B00BXZ3D6Y|4|Kinda slow
B00064AM6C|5|I have never had the privilege to see the White Stripes live, but this was an excellent substitute. Even sitting in the comfort of my own home, I wanted to jump up and pogo with the audience. Ever hear people say they have a hole in their sound? Ha! Watch this my friend. Prepare to get a hurricane of sound thrown your way, with the energy and electricty of a lightning storm. Jack is like a mad scientist on stage, constantly tweeking, switching, improvising, concocting fantastic potions of sound. Raw, undiluted, pure- the way any performance should be. Watching this makes you wonder why other bands bother with 2 or 3 more members. I read a review of one of their performances once where the guy said how you can't believe you got your ass kicked my just two people. Exactly. If you're not already a believer, this performance should make you one.  <br />In their version of Jolene, Jack wails with the pain and intensity of someone who knows the sentiment of the song.  <br />As you watch, you begin to understand that, unlike most bands who get up on stage and showboat and puke out what's on their CD, the White Stripes get on stage to please themselves, and along the way ultimately satisfy anyone listening. As you watch, mesmerized, admiring Jack's mad genius, you can't help but scream inside yourself, \\"IT'S ALIVE!!!\\"
B0096YJDNQ|5|Nice to have a handy reference to the night sky. Simple to use, many options. Great graphics, good product, thanks.
B0017TFLBQ|5|I HAVE loved having this game again and have been playing way too much!!!  I think it is fun, pretty simple to play, yet has lots of good strategy and each castle you get is a little different as with each scenario.
B0007GAERG|1|One of the most annoying singers on earth is back after an extended (and welcomed) vacation and she's on top again, thanks to one great song on this cd, \\"We Belong Together,\\" which takes her back to her roots and is the type of ballad that she does well. This probably annoys her to no end considering that she is still the diva wanna-be, trying so hard to be \\"hip hop\\" and becoming an embarrassment in the process. The album cover photo, obviously borrowed from Beyonce, should be a warning! She's even darkened her skin tone! (shades of Michael Jackson???) \\"We Belong Together\\" is the only decent song on the cd - a jazzy \\"Stay The Night\\" is a good try -but most of the music here is tired and mediocre (especially \\"Shake It Off,\\" the second release, which has to be one of the most irritating songs ever recorded!)
B008BD9SI8|3|I like all of Joe Abercrombies work but this one I liked the least so far. It had all the ingredients to be great: Excellent characters from previous stories making fresh appearances, a new setting with lots of potential, some insights into the history of the first law trilogy and even a boxing match. Despite this it didnt have the epic feel or scope of the previous books and by the end I felt like I had just read a medieval version of Shane mixed with True Grit that was a much smaller story than I was hoping it would be.
B001UEBHYS|5|What a Great movie. It looked lower budget but the actors were fabulous and the story line was captivating. Love.
B00IX9UTLU|5|I thought this was a takeoff on 50 Shades but I got caught up in the story. Yes, there was a story besides all the sexual content.  Kept me reading and rooting for Alayna
B008JFUR10|1|comm'on.. best movie ever made? Teens today never have seen &#34;Gone with the wind&#34;, &#34;Ben Hur&#34;, &#34;Citizen Kane&#34; or &#34;Peyton Place&#34; with really good acting.<br />This movie &#34;Pacific Rim&#34; is totally waste of time. To bad that everything has to be loud and a lot action today.<br /><br />Picture quality and sound are good - no question.
B0054JZC6E|4|i really like it. the games are fun and easy and I like that about it.. would definitely recommend it
B0098VYCCE|1|I have Netflix and Hulu Plus. I never have any problems streaming movies from other venders. But Amazon stops every two minutes to catch up with its buffer. So if you want to watch a circle go round and round for two hours the go ahead and stream this. I will never rent another movie from Amazon.
B005Q1W10A|5|Just wish sometimes people could live happily ever after..like in a fairy tale..I know this is like real life and it isn't always happily ever after...but I can wish....
B007PT3QOQ|5|This game is totally the best city building game so far. An awesome thing about this game is that its on a handheld device so you can play it on the go.
B00B2JSRAS|1|I've always been a huge fan of creative visualization and creating your own destiny through your thoughts (works for me on so many levels), couldn't wait to do the experiments to prove how well it works. I definitely went into it believing they would. Sadly, for me anyway, none of them did. Well, that was a waste of time and money. (Also, I'm not a religious person but the references to God as 'Dude' is a bit weird.)
B007PT3QOQ|5|good game. Brings me back to when I used to play on the computer. love it!! would recommend it. great!
B0068853O6|4|Very good movie showing the craziness of war
B003ONNWO6|5|I just finished watching the DVD (HIT MAN) for the third time. If I could have one DVD Musical, It would be this DVD.<br />David is joined by a host of great entertainers. It's a tribute to Mr. Foster by Andrea Bocelli, Michael Buble, Celine Dion,<br />Josh Groban, just a few of the greats,with many more. You will love the quips and humor, changing of words. A must see in 55 inches and surround a sound. Get the whole family together for this one. All five star rating. This is a Blue-Ray Disc.<br />Theatre quality sound, Total HD image. Incredible color. inclosed a folder showing 15 of the entertainers. How on earth do you<br />top this, Dave.
6305750750|4|Gosh, what a great movie. . .  What is good about it?  The story!  Yes, the story.  If you feel that the movie is about a young boy that will eventually become Darth Vader, you are wrong.  Its not about Anakin.  The  action surrounds the Trade Federation blockade of Naboo.  I won't spoil the  movie for those that haven't seen it, but there are motivations behind this  blockade.  If you have seen this movie, think about this for a moment and  then re-evaluate. . .<br />The acting?  This is a spot of contention.  I feel  Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Ian McDiarmid and Pernellia August are  wonderful!  Ewan McGreggor doesn't get a chance to shine as he does in  other movies (for lack of participation.)  He only has about 15 lines  total.  <br />All technical aspects of the movie are outstanding.  I won't go  into much detail here.  Just read some of the other reviews. . .<br />Was it  perfect?  No.  At first I didn't like Jar Jar, but he's grown on me since  my first viewing. Jake Lloyd is not up to the task of showing emotion  (especially when saying goodbye to his mother) in his acting.  The  Midiclorians turn Star Wars into Star Trek.<br />Is it worth seeing?   Definitely.  Is it the best movie of all time?  Definitely not.  Does it  live up to all the hype that the media, fans and Lucas poured on us for  months?  How could it?  <br />I cannot understand how people can say they  didn't like this movie.  It has everything a movie needs: Plot, characters,  action, music, suspense. . . Those that say it doesn't have these elements  weren't paying attention. . .<br />Go see it.  Decide for yourself. . .
B009C7ZQM4|5|I have a Kindle Fire and it was getting a bit sluggish. I loaded two other apps that did nothing. I had Clean Master on my phone and it worked great. I loaded it on my Kindle tried it and it improved it 100% It is better now than when it was new. I would pay $5.00 for this app and not even think about it.
B00H14WTLQ|3|I forgot how silly the first Batman movies were compared to the new ones, but still enjoyed the cape crusader.
B00H4M3216|5|Love the truth of struggles in their lives and those around them, love the cast
B004NJC0B6|5|It's great to see the real and much better sounding band with Bonn Scott.
B007TMON8M|5|very fun way to learn this is a great game junction make another great game both of these games make you think
B0025KVLRY|1|If you don't like your main vocals to only come out of one speaker (Right), avoid this.  It's really a shame you have to fork out $250 to get the first four CD's in mono.  (Of course you get more, but those are the only ones you really need .. maybe Mono Masters too.)    Back when they released the original CD's, the first four were Mono, then all the rest in Stereo,  with good mixes as far as my ear could tell. The Past Masters also contained Mono mixes for some  of the songs.    I've been ripping these new 2009 CD's to the computer, and comparing back & forth.   So far I've noticed a big improvement, except here. I literally hate this one.    So my new plan is to keep the first four + Past Masters, and upgrade the rest.  Hopefully in the future, they'll make those first four available in Mono by themselves.    Update 9-13-09    I have tried the Mix to Mono suggestion a few other reviewers have mentioned. On a Mac I used  Quicktime Pro to export each track to Mono. On a Windows machine, you could use a free program  such as Audacity. (It only takes about 5 seconds for each track.) I have to say that this is  a great idea. I realize we all have different tastes, and so each of us may prefer these albums   the way we remember them. So if you can't afford the Mono set (I fit this category for sure),  then this is the best alternative. I still hope EMI will make the Mono Masters available   individually, so until then this will have to do.
B004RFYEEC|4|Thus is a very comprehensive collection of music recorded during The Beach Boys' sessions for the aborted SMiLE album.  Five CDs, two LPs and two 45s.  The first CD and the LPs start with a version of the album that duplicates the sequence of SMiLE that Brian Wilson completed decades later without the Beach Boys.  Of course, if SMiLE had been completed in the 1960s, it would not have been sequenced this way.  For one thing, the rest of &#34;The Elements Suite&#34; would have been completed, instead of just &#34;Fire&#34;.  After that, we get tons of outtakes from the sessions that also follow that same sequence (more or less).  &#34;Good Vibrations&#34; gets it's own disc and &#34;Heroes and Villains&#34; gets about 95% of one disc.  This is great music, but it would be too much of a good thing for all but fanatics.
B003XF1XOQ|3|I loved the book all the way up the closing chapters. The gruesome unnecessary killings were in bad taste. I truly hope they change the ending in the movie. This could possible be one of those very rare cases where the movie is better than the book. :-(
B00A3NQNUU|1|This Game Leads You Along StepByStep Which Is Annoying And Makes It Feel Geared Towards Kids. Then After My Third Dragon It Glitched And Kept Telling MeTo DoWhat I Already Had. Since It Doesn't Allow Self Guided Play The Game Was Stuck. I Wish There Was A Settings Option Or Restart Game. I Might Have Played Longer If It Allowed More FreePlay And Didn't Glitch.
B0081336FO|5|Love the second season of this show.  The stories are well written and true to the originals.  Look forward to viewing the next season.
1401322786|5|The story begins with Dor, the first man in the world to think about and measure time. But as punishment for measuring God's greatest gift, he becomes Father Time. Forced to live in a cave where time is meaningless and eternally listen to the pleas of mankind asking for more minutes, days, years.<br />After thousands of years, Father Time is given a chance to redeem himself by seeking out two people on Earth and teaching them the true meaning of time. Thrown into the current world, Father Time learns that his innocent measures of time have evolved into desperate time tracking. Seeking two people whose pleas Father Time heard, he finds Victor, a wealthy business man whom wants to live forever, and Sarah, a girl who wants time to end. Dor must teach them the true meaning of time to save them, but in the process save himself.<br />Albom provides another beautiful novel that explores the concept of time that we all take for granted. Through his thought provoking prose and diverse characters, Albom, teaches us something more important than counting the minutes, hours, and days- he explores the true meaning of time, why God limits it, and what really matters in life.<br />baseballvalbooks.wordpress.com
B00AMBLXP8|4|Pretty funny until the last 45 minutes or so. Something from Seth McFarland tends to be hilarious and have an unusual twist at the end.  Instead of a funny twist, you get 45 minutes of wasted film.
B006MW3UZW|5|Everyone one has been telling me what a great series Downton Abbey is.  I am catching up and love the show, really looking forward to the next episodes, in Season 3.
B00011RPB0|1|Man, what a boring film!  Different, but boring.  Different because it is an American film pretending to be a European one.  How it got rave reviews is beyond me.  Is it because Sofia Copolla made it?   If she made a 3-hour feature with nothing but asses crapping from beginning to end, the critics would go \\"ooooh, aaaah!\\"   <br /> <br />The Japanese were shown in very bad light - merely as a bunch of buffoons and intruders.    <br /> <br />On the merit side, both lead characters looked convincingly bored throughout the film (they were probably stunned into looking that way from reading the script).  That should explain all the awards. <br /> <br />I normally prefer to complete watching a movie once I've started.  I agonized through this one.   <br /> <br />I agree with one of the reviewers.  Sofia ought to return her awards. <br /> <br />You think this critique (or whatever) is juvenile?  Wait till you watch the film! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B002SRQ214|5|Love this processor. Good price and still fast enough to run all my games when paired with a Nvidia GTX460.
B0086700CM|5|how could u not like it peeps its so fun its like the best game amazon has came out with
B00DXP7L88|3|This is a real hotch potch of stories, killers and love interests.<br />Disappointed with the final endind, without spoiling anything for those who haven't seen it. It could have finished maybe 5 mins before it did. In the case of that happening it would have kept it's integrity.
B000NVIXFK|4|I would label myself a relatively casual Rush fan...really loved them in high school (Moving Pictures/Exit Stage Left etc.), lost track of them a bit in the 90's, now back on board (I was lucky enough to see them on the Vapor Trails tour, what a great show they still do after all these years).  Vapor Trails had its moments but I like Snakes and Arrows MUCH more, the songs are more intricate and memorable, I also love that Alex Lifeson is incorporating more guitar textures (acoustic, effects, etc.) instead of just wailing (even though his wailing is awfully good in itself!).  The bass lines are awesome (I love to turn the bass up so I can appreciate Geddy's genius) and believe it or not, I am kind of glad that Geddy can't hit the same high notes he used to.  I never had a problem with his voice, but the fact that he is a little less shrieky actually improves their music in my opinion.  Not every single song on here is a \\"keeper\\" but overall there are a lot of songs that stick in your head and the instrumentals are pretty cool, too.  If you love any of Rush's past work, you'll find plenty to like here.
B00C81AVNU|4|Very enjoyable show. The leads are wonderful. Particularly like &#34;Not My Father's Son.&#34;
B00005B36H|5|This is the third Tool Album I have bought.  It is as good as (if not better) than Aenima.  The reason I take slight preference to Later Alus is because of the theme &quot;Enlightenment&quot; that I hear in almost all of it's songs (and on the cover).  In a way, this CD acts not like 12 songs, but as one song.  If you listen to every song in order, then it is as though you are listening to one song or story.  After listening to Aenima for the first time, I had to get on Quake 3 and frag someone before I tore up my room; it filled me with a sort of rage that I couldn't suppress.  Later Alus does the opposite.  After listening to it, I felt as though my mind had just come out of one of those health spas.  It felt refreshed, focused, and full of vigor.  I am keen on this theme of &quot;enlightenment&quot; simply because I am a Unitarian.  Enlightenment is sort of the whole theme behind Unitarianism, and Later Alus is sort of like a CD that puts enlightenment into 50 minutes of euphoric music that no music fan should be without.  If you like music, and don't mind electric guitar music, then please do yourself a favor and BUY THIS CD.  If you are a Tool fan, but are unsure wether to get this CD, I urge you to get it.  For approximately the first month, I thought I had wasted my money.  But then I listened to it more, and suddenly it started clicking in my brain.  Since then it has become my favorite.  Listen to it from front to back, you will see what I mean :)
B003YL4LYI|4|What can I say about \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" that you couldn't figure out for yourself.<br /><br />You already know that none of the threads will be wound up to a happy ending.<br /><br />You already know that several \\"main\\" characters will end up dead.<br /><br />You already know that there will be around one hundred and thirty seven new characters doing new things.<br /><br />You already know that the writing will spread out to fill a pre-chosen X-hundred blank pages.<br /><br />I found the pacing in this one very slow, and by a third of the way in longed for the Eastern continent to suffer the tectonic disaster I was sure was waiting in the wings and swallow all the bloody characters on it so the story could drop a cog and get some traction.<br /><br />Roughly half of it takes place during the action of the previous installment but concerns the events on the Eastern continent, then it resynchronizes with \\"real time\\" and the action broadens again, moving in part back to Westeros.<br /><br />In the six years between the last novel and this one GRRM discovered the word \\"leal\\" and it gets used everywhere he would have written (and indeed did write) \\"loyal\\", to the point it starts grating the gears. It would have worked well as a regional thing, but that's not how the writer used it unfortunately. Expect a retroactive editing in the other four books to make them match up properly sometime in the future.<br /><br />I love the series but I'm getting the distinct feeling that GRRM is now milking it for all its worth - especially as it took so long for the kindle edition to become reasonably (more than reasonably as it turned out) priced and in the interim there have been published some notable stinker side products.<br /><br />I'm kind of laughing at the situation GRRM's engineered for himself - where the in-print action is so far from finishing that he'll not be able to deliver the complete saga before the TV series reaches the logical end.
B00506NRBS|3|I purchased this on audio book.  Some humbling lessons, and some decent firsthand insight.  Solid.  I think the firsthand perspective is useful, but I did think there were some thoughts and actions that were conflicting to his ideas and proposals.  He is honest & insightful, so its definitely worth picking up
B003YOZNBU|5|great movie
B0000AUHPK|5|This our favorite version of the classic story, bar none.  The cast is superb and the music score will lift you out of your chair!<br /><br />Paul Baragona  Raleigh, NC  USA
B00000AFWZ|5|This is a beautiful collection of Psychedelic gems. I have the original vinyl version on Elektra records and this has been expanded to include more great bands and musical masterpieces. I have always been a fan of 60's  Psychedelia having lived through this period and it was a very creative and  exciting time. There are many new bands in this great box set that have not  been heard from in years and deserve the exposure and recognition. Also  included is a huge booklet  with cool pix and biographical insight on the  artists and songs. This is a must have and I highly recommend it to all  music lovers and fans of the great 60's music period known as Psychedelia.
B001NHNG64|2|takes forever to get going.  If Jack is such a bad ass he sure dosnt act like it.  Not impressed
B00AJFEHAU|5|arrived on time and a great EP
B004KPLVV8|5|Great buy and timely shipping  Enjoying the original, thanks  The 80's had some great ideas for movies that we come back to today
6305728437|4|Very good. A strong plot, a inspired Eddie Murphy as the Dargons voice, very few of that typical lousy songs of Disneys movies, good characters, plausible ending. The best!
0679805273|5|I remember this book from when I was a child and still love Dr. Suess! I saw the idea on Pinterest to have your child's teacher sign somewhere in this book each year and then to give the book to your child when they graduate high school with all of the signatures, so I came to Amazon and ordered it. I'm excited to do this and love the book!
B00G0MLD94|5|My 6 yr old daughter loves Ever After High, and with these prices I had to buy this doll! A few small pieces, like a tiny ring. Really nice outfit and great quality too. So glad I bought her.
B00AEFY3DQ|5|This is one of my favorite parody's of a star trek film. It is very funny and great for those that like startrek
0393072231|4|Awesome book - great peek inside the drivers of the financial crisis!
B0046H95PO|5|This is Agatha Christie on top form. As the author of classic British mysteries [[ASIN:B004ZGLDVK Hundred Thousand Dragons, A (Jack Haldean Mysteries)]]Agatha Christie is the writer I turn to most for inspiration and sheer enjoyment. I love the way we get to know the characters so quickly and the mystery builds so well. Poriot is cut off from any outside help, so he has to rely on nothing but his own \\"little grey cells\\" and does it superbly. The ending is brilliant and very satisfactory.<br />Great stuff.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Excellent book, funny, riveting and edge of your seat reading! Loved it! The McGyver of science fiction and I generally don't like science fiction, but this was great!
0743238257|5|A new best seller book with 2nd hand price by the famous author. Plus the priceless content of the book itself. What else you could expect?
0385537131|5|Sycamore Row takes us back to Jake Brigance,the main character of the John Grisham's first novel,A Time To Kill.In this novel,he is now defending the late Seth Hubbard's will,who gave most of his wealth to an African-American woman,Lettie Lang.Although the book can be somewhat be dragging and slow in the middle and too predictable at the end,it was definitely a fun novel to read.This will definitely be enjoyed by an Grisham fan.
B00CSR2J9I|5|This is so cool! Very addicting. But such a great game for free. I would highly recommend giving it a try and see if you can put it down!
0307460444|5|. . .this is an amazing book.  The ideas are fantastic, very innovative, and really creative decorating.  The fact that I cannot stand the woman and could get past it to give this 5 stars tells you a lot.
B0013F1D02|5|Plenty of action in this enjoyable fantasy. I wonder how they got Robert DiNero to play the part of a cross dressing pirate in this whimsicle situation.
B0054TKB8I|4|Good grounding for the series.  This explains how he got to be a werewolf.  Let's your imagination soar to the next show.
B0002X314C|5|First lemme just say that I love this brother's music! I really hope he cleans up at the Grammys next year cause he's that damn good. I listen to this cd all the damn time! Just outstanding production and beats from Kanye West and John can really blow baby...one of the best R&B debut albums that I've heard in a looooooong time. DO NOT...and I repeat DO NOT sleep on this cd!
B0086700CM|5|The game is like heaven itself maybe things that are in the game is weird like the monkey's I am talking about the game ever saw this before so I downloaded it
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is amazing I love how the scenery changes over a period of time and you also can challenge your Facebook friends. I also love how you can collect cops depending on what site you're on.
B000TM1CKQ|5|this show is absolutely hilarious.  it depicts the lives of 5 late 20-something individuals and how they interact as unconditional best friends as well as people searching for love.  the humor is legendary, the plots original, and if you want to laugh for 30 minutes straight, watch an episode.  i guarantee you'll hook your friends on this series, and you will all be quoting or referencing this show, because our lives today are very similar.  if you have only 1 show to choose for your viewing pleasure, this is the one!  buy how i met your mother today!
B008602KQI|4|Jennifer Lawrence could read the phone book and I would be fascinated. However, the plot of the Hunger Games is rather weak. Predicting the future has always been a stumbling block for most science fiction writers. We've seen plenty of versions regarding how terrible the future will be... going all the way back to Huxley and Wells. This one divides the country (I presume it is America) into the very wealthy and the very poor, with one poor person given the chance to survive a publically broadcast games that pit children against one another until only one is left standing. This is about as likely as never happening. The premise is so weak as to make the rest of the movie a joke. Supporting performances are also weak. The film relies almost entirely on special effects and the performances of Lawrence and veteran Donald Sutherland. While I love science fiction, I found the end did not justify the means. The plot is weak throughout and solution is open ended, hence Hunger Games, two - will Jennifer end up with her true boyfriend; will she have to volunteer for the games again (she'd have to survive because I believe there is a book three!!!!). Unfortunately, it did well at the box office and Hollywood loves a winner so there will be more coming... but I will not be watching.
B004Y042N8|5|This game is simple, period. Don't expect 3D images, music or great sound effects. This is a simple, but smart and well designed game that fits its purpose. I have been playing it two days so far and I have not get bored while I have had the time to play it. I recommend it.
B0078Q2HAA|1|Can't add much more to the other one star reviews. Half the movie was about the most undignified part of her life! SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE A REAL MOVIE ABOUT MARGARET THATCHER!!
B00DJFIMW6|5|My son loves the game.
B00BB8SKPW|5|I thought the movie was excellent.  The acting was great,  the story line was good and it was even a little emotional.
B00D5XYY4M|2|Ok
B004DLPXAO|5|I like having it with me on my galaxy 3 works just like kindle.  Easy to make text larger and fast to access.
B00BHHIWQO|4|great game. very interesting. just need more life's available. not long enough time to play game. I play it all the time.
B000001ES9|4|I was stunned to find out from a friend that it took 21 years for this album to go gold here in the U.S. This is some of Rush's best work right here. It should have went platinum when it came out. And people thought  that COS sold poorly, that album went gold I think ten years ago. That is  an awesome album as well, but anyway, on with the first album... Finding My  Way is a great tune. It has a real Led Zeppelin kind of feel. The opening  riff is amzing, too. NSL, ITM, WYD, and HA are great songs, too. WYD,  especially because of its Led Zeppelin-like sound. It has the same beat to  it as Immigrant Song from Led Zep. This album pretty much sounds a little  like Zeppelin if you listen closely. TAF is a good song you can play for  your friends if they're lonely or depressed or just upset. Not one song on  this album is bad at all. BAA and WM are kicking major ass on this album.  Geddy, Alex, and John do a very superb job. Working Man is by the far the  best song on this album. It shows how much Alex kicks ass on the guitar and  Geddy kicks ass on the bass. John did a good drum job as well. I don't like  the way they perform this song live with Neil, though. It's just not as  good as the album version. Excellent solos, excellent riffs, excellent bass  lines, and Geddy's vocals are what make this song a Rush classic. Hell,  this was they're first hit (well, at least in some places anyway). If you  are a true Rush fan like me, you must own this great album. If you're just  starting to get into Rush, get this disc first. You will not be  disappointed. : )<br />Ciao!
B00J8CG6KE|1|It was pitiful,  didn't like it at all.  I would rate it zero.  It was not at all what I expected.
031286504X|5|If you are expecting anything like the movie, then don't. The similarities to the movie stop after the name of the book and the name of the main character, Robert Neville. This book is great although not chilling or scary, but it brings the reader to another world in which the whole world has turned into a vampiric race. Most of the novel takes place in Neville's home and I would recommend this book to anyone that can read. 5/5
B007BFSYMS|3|I was told from the description that you can change the color and brightness of the alarm or standby clock and I can't seem to find the option to do that at all. It's frustrating because of his being the presets are for the app. Definitely shouldn't have spent the money on this app I probably couldn't find a better one :/
B00688628M|5|I recommend to anyone who wants to know more about the 101st airborne.<br />They were droppen into action and always surrounded.

B0018CAANG|5|Hard Candy has finally arrived. I have been waiting impatiently for this release. I have to admit that this is one of Madonna's best albums. For those of you who are worried that this album is too Timbaland/Pharrell/Timberlake, FEAR NOT! . . . This album is very much Madonna. The songs are amazing and the overall feel of the album is amazing. 4 Minutes does not represent the album properly. There are many other tracks that are much better than the first single. Gems like Give It 2 Me & Incredible give a better insight into what Hard Candy sounds like. Don't be quick to judge and take a listen. You're in for a sweet surprise!!     Here's a track by track review:     Candy Shop: This is pretty much the same version as the one that leaked months ago. Im guessing Madonna   liked how it sounded so she didn't bother to change it. Still it is fun to listen to.   \\"My Sugar is RAW\\"     4 Minutes: You all know this one.     Give It 2 Me: Definitely one of the best tracks. It has a modern pop sound with some 80s influence. Very fun & energetic.   \\"Get Stupid, Don't Stop It\\"     Heartbeat: Love the electro-sound of this track. More of a mid-tempo song but still good enough to dance to.   \\"See My Booty Get Down\\"     Miles Away: Very Sweet. Obviously for her hubby Guy. This song features some acoustic guitars as well as some dance flavor towards the end.   \\"You always have the biggest heart when we're 6,000 miles apart\\"     She's Not Me: This song reminds me of Sorry. M letting the guy know that no one compares to her. Good sound and great lyrics.   \\"She doesn't have what's ours\\"     Incredible: Hands down the best song on the album. Love how the momentum builds up as the song progresses. Just an amazing dance song.   \\"Sex with you is . . . Incredible\\"     Beat Goes On: Looks like Madonna took her advice from the demo and tried something new. Although I liked the demo it felt like it was missing something. This version feels complete and Kanye's rap fits perfectly. Has a nice pop/urban sound to it.   \\"Don't sit there like some silly girl\\"     Dance 2night: This song is okay. I was expecting this song to be upbeat like 4 minutes. The lyrics are good though.   \\"You don't have to be beautiful to be understood\\"     Spanish Lesson: Very fun and upbeat. It's great to hear M singing some Spanish again. Although the translations aren't 100% correct it is still great to hear some \\"lessons.\\" This song really makes me want to get up and dance.   \\"Yo te quiero means I Love You\\"     Devil: Im glad that this song was finally conceived. Love the dark feel to it. Many compare it to Cry Me A River but I think that it is way better than River. Another great gem.   \\"I play right into it, who am I to criticize?\\"    Voices: Another dark track. Very haunting. Good lyrics and emotional ending. Very similar to the ending on Push.   \\"Who is the master & who is the slave?\\"     Ring My Bell: The pre-order track. This song is decent. Too bad it didn't make the final cut.     Remixes: The remixes are decent. I really like Junkie XL and the Oakenfold mix of Give it 2 me is amazing.     So here's the review.   Hope that you will enjoy the album like I am right now. Don't be quick to judge and   listen to the album. Forget the whole Timbaland & Co. and their attachment to the   album. Madonna definitely takes the wheel and the producers take the back seat. I   recommend this album to all fans, newbies, and anyone looking for a great workout   album. Remember to \\"Work up a sweat cause that's what music's for.\\"
B00H8XF9I0|5|Great
B00BHU9CCO|5|Was a great movie back when it came out, and has held up well. Still looks pretty amazing.
B005USZML4|5|I just finished reading this book.  It is a wonderful book for all reading levels from about middle school and up.  I like how John Grisham has started writing a series about one person and it happens to be a teenager.  This is a must read for any fan of John Grisham and this genre of books. My son just started reading it and he loves it.  He just finished the first one in the series and loved it. He is only in the third grade.
B008X9QHLQ|5|Love it. Always have, always will.
014028009X|4|This book will leave you laughing! It's not brain surgery but still a fun way to pass the time.  Seriously this was a very witty light read that just about anyone can relate to at some time in their lives.  Follow Bridget through lifes little ups and downs and laugh while your at it!  Bridget is a total fruitcake but fun!  Enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I enjoyed this book like no other, I could not put it down. It was a great story.  I look forward to the next book from this author .
B008YRVW0I|5|This is my go to game.  You can buy fish and supplies when you earn enough points.  The aquarium is beautiful.
B001ANSS5K|3|I loved &#34;Looking for Alaska&#34; and &#34;Fault in Our Stars&#34; so this one was hard to follow up. It was ok, but I felt much of the story was drug out. Quick read though, I'm interested to see how the movie compares.
B00QW8TYWO|5|It was very fun and funny I think that it is a great game and great for parents who don't want there kids to be playing inappropriate games. CROSSYROAD IS AWESOME!!!!!!😄😄😄😄😸😸😸😸😸🙊
B00N1JQ2UO|5|Best movie all year
0743298039|5|I was looking for a good story and an easy summer vacation read. The Thirteenth Tale fits the bill. It's a page turner and a great Gothic story. The characters are rather shallow, but that's okay, because their only reason for existence is the story, and the story does not dissapoint. The writing is not extraordinary or particularily memorable (I have not written down any quotes), but it is solid and facilitates this original tale. Recommended.
B005BQTUVI|5|satisfied
141694737X|5|I bought this for my 3 month old son for Christmas.  He is a little young for the flaps, but the book is durable and VERY cute.  Great for little ones.
B005PK553C|5|I discovered this show after season 1 and 2 were originally aired.  I cannot stop watching....it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  If you like a good thriller/horror, this is sure to please.  Anxiously awaiting season 3 starting in October on FX.
B00NXL7GIM|5|Excellent
B007V2UGPE|5|awesome game amazing a very very very very very very fun game will give it a 5 star try the game out

B005Z271Y6|5|This concert is almost like being there.  Adele is fabulous and her talent is huge and her emotions strong. Having Blu ray and the CD make it easy to enjoy her visually and verbally.
B00M7UTFW0|1|The best feature about this movie on Amazon Prime is that I kept losing internet connection, 3 times before the movie was half way through.  I finally gave up or I probably would have rated it a 1/2 star. For me, instead of being an inspiring epic, it was more of a cross between Lord of the Ring and Transformers.
B004MC8CA2|5|Recently, my grandaughter added the Bible to my Kindle Fire. It seems to be very easy to use, being able to move from  the Books of the Bible to chapters and verses I'm a King James and NIV reader, but find it easy to read from other versions.<br />Thanks for making this so easy and comfortable for me.  Theresa
B00FVZJYK6|5|We all watched it, it's a great kids and beyond movie!!! You can watch it over and over (like my daughter did) and not get bored ..probably love it even more lol
B00CKH9WOQ|5|Bought this doll for my granddaughter age 7 for Christmas.. She loves it.. As a Monster High collector, She loves it because it is so different. She says it's her favorite.
B00B7Y0206|2|Whenever I open it it how  the last video I watched, I hit back but then it goes to my home screen and when I open it again, same thing. Don't download it because  you can't se  through the adds ether
B00P42WROG|5|Finders Keepers is a nail biting novel that takes the reader on a thrilling, unknowing, and anxious ride. Leave it to King to bring the main characters live's parallel to one another albeit in different eras. I literally could not put this book down, and the ending seems to be the beginning of another novel. I highly recommend it.
B001KVZ6FW|2|Rented the movie today and thought it was only OK.  Certainly didn't live up to the Pixar reputation like the Incredibles and Toy Story.  It was rather violent for an animated film and there was no solid plot to follow. Funny parts throughout the movie, but I can't see a child getting into it or being able to follow it.
1419715089|5|I started purchasing this authors books for my 7 year old granddaughter. This was my 2nd purchase from the group. She has really gotten to become an avid reader because not only can she learn to grow in a most positive way but they make it easy for her to relate to other kids and the importance of kindness and compassion for those that might be different. Much easier because the information is coming from a place of their choice. The &#34;Best&#34; part is there are hundreds to purchase and help with their growth process and they can be passed down.
B004QYZATW|4|This is a nice throwback to classic spy, mystery, thriller, romance films of the 1960s.  Don't expect any frenetic car chases with fast-cut editing here.  This is all about picture-perfect settings, elegant women, and subtle dialogue that creates a sophisticated look and feel within the wonderful European charm that is Venice.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is perfectly cast as a mysterious woman who oozes charm and seduction with every glance of her eye and subtle sway of her hips.  Scotland Yard and other European authorities are following her in hopes of finding a thief who has stolen a great deal of money.  Johnny Depp is a hapless tourist who through a chance meeting gets caught up in her web of activities and people tracking her.<br /><br />The plot takes some small twists and turns that keep the viewer guessing a bit as to how things will turn out.  There is great cinematography amidst the wondrous canals of Venice, and no camera could love Jolie more than in this film.  Depp is drawn to her as a moth to the proverbial flame, and no man could blame him.<br /><br />The movie falls short of a high level of excellence probably because of weaknesses in the script.  There were no glaring flaws exactly, but there were no clear strengths either beyond the basic concept.  However, the other film elements make up for this to create a fine escape with plenty of charm and eye candy from the settings and the personas of Jolie and Depp.  It's a nice tribute to an older style of European mystery-thriller and romantic-comedy filmmaking with a strong cast of modern actors in both the lead and supporting roles.
B004WMKSH2|4|I'm a decade late on the Harry Potter Movies & Books, the Movie was decent, I just like the books better, Advent Reader
1455550639|4|Good suspense mystery with Harry Bosch solving the case in the end.  The story definitely holds ones attention until the end.
B002MQYOFW|4|Alll the books of the hunger games were a fast fun read.  The author really hurried to end the books not at all what I would have liked.
B005GFPZYK|4|This book gives you a glimpse into the mind of a sniper and the training required to succeed as a sniper.
B000000OE7|5|In November of 1991, Freddie Mercury announced he had AIDS. Less than 2 days later, he died. I remember the utter feeling of loss upon hearing this news. I had been a Queen fan since the mid-70's and the group was  instrumental in my discovery of my own musical ability. For days I listened  to Queen, from the earliest albums to Innuendo. I lamented the fact that  there would be no more music from this group. The months and years rolled  by. The Freddie tribute at Wembly Stadium was a wonderful tribute by those  who admired or were inspired by Queen. Then in 1995, I walked into a local  record store and sitting in the new releases bin was Made in Heaven. At  first, I thought it was another Greatest Hits album but looking at the back  cover I saw it was new material. Needless to say, I bought it and sat with  my headphones. This album brought a sense of closure for me. It gave a last  shining moment tinged with sadness as much of the album represented the  final months of Freddie's life. His performance is inspirational. In  Innuendo and Made in Heaven, both albums work together to paint a great  talent in the last acts of his life. The anger, bitterness and eventual  acceptance of his ending bring a fitting finale for Queen. As a group, they  will be missed. For Freddie, I hope he has found peace in the world beyond.
B008JFUTT0|5|You wont buy a better one. talk about a heart wrenching feel good story with such a happy ending. WOrds dont describe this moive well enough.

1451648537|5|Apple Computer's founder Steve Jobs astounded the world with his creative vision and confounded people with his mercurial, often cruel personality. Best-selling biographer and media insider Walter Isaacson synthesizes the conflicting aspects, rooted deep within Jobs's psyche, of a man whose harsh and relentless demand for perfection at times threatened to overshadow his genius. Written at Jobs's request soon after his cancer diagnosis - but without his control or final say - Isaacson's book thoroughly dissects the Apple founder's life through extensive interviews and research. getAbstract recommends this definitive biography of a complicated, creative and ultimately world-changing persona.
B007SYWFRM|5|OMG this is the cutest game ever, when I first played it was able to see other villages and able to message, since reset of my kindle I have lost that and only have weird villages to visit, but the graphics are so cute, with the animals, and I play it on a daily basis just to keep the animals happy, they do ask if you wanna buy stuff, I never do and still have fun with this adorably cute game.
B006OAB3ME|5|My favorite CD.  Saw Paul at Candlestick last summer...such a thrill!
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is challenging and lots of fun.  The colorful graphics make it exciting.  I try to play it a couple of times a day.
B00K9V2OPE|5|I finally took the time to read this after hearing so many good things. This book is a rarity to me. This book made me feel every emotion. I laughed, I was angry, I was sad, I was anxious. This is how love stories should be. The love that grew between Ashlyn & Mr. Daniels was nothing short of beautiful. The idea of Ash's sister leaving her a bucket list and those letters was powerful to me. It helped Ash move forward in her life until she could find the strength to find herself. I would have loved to see what was on the whole list. The writing style of this book was amazing. I loved the incorporation of Shakespeare's works. I wish all the books I read were as awesome as this!
B00026WU64|5|The classic we know and love, in a clear great-sounding remaster. Nothing radical as far as the remaster is concerned, it just sounds terrific.
B008FRFN7A|5|all I need is the printer turned on
B00FAPF5U0|5|Once you start, you can't stop.  So much fun, and keeps one thinking to outsmart the game. You gotta try it.
B0006ZFQP8|5|While I love the classic, critically acclaimed recordings by Furtwangler and Bohm, if I had to choose only one recording of this opera, it would be this one. It does have its minor quirks, and Kollo is not my favorite Tristan. But after years of loyalty to the \\"famous\\" recordings, I finally had to admit that overall, I enjoy listening to this one the most. And isn't that what listening to music is about: enjoyment? I think classical music lovers (including myself) often fall into the trap of buying or listening to something just because the \\"experts\\" recommend it. While there's nothing wrong with consulting informed opinions on the many choices of classical recordings, in the end they are only opinions. Try to hear samples or borrow recordings to find the version that is best for you before buying, or own multiple versions if you can afford it.     There are many reasons I like this one best. You may or may not agree, but try to hear it for yourself before making up your mind, instead of trusting negative reviews. In my opinion:     Kleiber's conducting is adventurous and refreshing; just be aware that it's very flexible in tempo, as can be heard in the climax of the Prelude. Price's Isolde is simply gorgeous, so who cares if she never sang the role on stage?! Kollo is a decent Tristan, better than you might have been led to believe, though Vickers is my favorite. And during the love duet, Price and Kollo sound more beautiful together than any other pair I've heard. Their voices actually harmonize instead of clashing because of wide vibrato (a common problem in this scene). This is very important to me, and one of the main reasons I like this set so much. The rest of the cast is fine. Who can complain about Moll's rich bass or Fassbaender's attractive mezzo? And I've never understood those who criticize Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in Wagnerian roles; I always enjoy his singing. And of course, the sound quality of this reissue is excellent, very warm and lush, whereas the original issue was fine but a bit steely. So for sheer enjoyment, I recommend this set above all others I've heard, though you should hear the classics if you can.
B00004Z459|5|ive listened to some of those rap rock cds and frankly they arent close to as good as this one exept limp bizkit  this one just blows some compitition out of the water they mix it all up with rap rock combo its great all the albums are cool exept for the 11th wich is ok but they could use a song their but overall it is a great cd for an up and coming band and you should help these guys out their great
B0029LCJJS|5|I love history and it couldn't be perfect, but it hit the basics. I loved the costumes. I can't imagine the costs.

B006885LZM|5|This is one of the best movies that I have seen.The story lines were very close to their real life.Battle scenes are very realistic and true.I have read all of the books that were written by the people in the movie.l would recommend this to anyone who likes world war 2 history.
B001OGWY1W|5|Of all the Batman movies, this one is the best
B000B19BCG|5|This is another fantastic album from Supergrass.  Taken on its own I give it 5 stars.  However, it's not quite the kind of album I look forward to from them so it's not my favorite.  (My favorites are \\"I Should Coco,\\" \\"In It For The Money,\\" and \\"Life On Other Planets.\\")  I prefer Supergrass' catchy fun pop songs, but this isn't that kind of album.  It's a top-notch album, don't get me wrong, I just sorta wish they'd released it under a different band name and also released an album or EP of stuff along the lines of \\"Grace\\" and \\"Pumpin' On Your Stereo.\\" <br /> <br />And by the way, if anyone from CAPITOL RECORDS is reading this: Please get off your butts and start publicizing these guys!  It's criminal that they're not as huge in the U.S. as they are elsewhere and it's only because you're not doing anything with them.  No one knows about them because they're not exposed to them; there's no media blitz like there is for your other acts.  You can start by making them more prominent on your slowwww, awful web site!
0920236162|5|Great debunking of the eternal saccharine &#34;princess&#34; and &#34;lived happily ever after&#34; tales, shows a spunky, clever, independent little girl.<br />Similar spirit as &#34;Stephanie's Ponytail&#34;. Good for teaching little girls they can think with their own head and not depend on anybody else's opinions, or get caught in passive traditional views of girls.

B00JB3NUHM|1|Story is already ridiculous why not go all out. This movie sucks.
1451620829|5|Great book that really shows the insights into the excesses of rock and roll.  Peter pulls no punches in his sometimes shocking account of his life both in and out of KISS and how he percieves the members of the band.  I took me about 2 days to ready this book as I could not put it down.  Must read for any KISS fan or any fan of rock and roll.

B009DCOU9S|4|A good addition to the Magic Academy series. Really liked the quirky characters with this one. The main reason this didn't get 5 stars is because you get thrown into a search with no direction at all and you have no choice but to tap around or hit the hint button. Also there are times it would be nice if there was a skip option for mini games and not just the hint.
B000HKW7E0|5|this is my 3rd  CD, they get used and borrowed all the time, and then I have to buy another one

B002VPE1WK|5|I really apreciate the purchase, it matches perfectly my expectations about the product, the shipment was fast, I received just in a while, price was good so I'm very satisfied with this purchase!
B00P7PJ9P0|1|I did not like the way the story was changed.
B007KW5N9Y|5|A poetic and spirited coming of age tale set against WWII, Empire of the Sun is an exceptional film. Its scope, narrative and elegant John Williams score (his best IMO) place this in more sophisticated company than Spielberg's usual childhood fantasies. Some viewers have remarked about its implausibilities and war as fantasy conceit, but this is a facile read on the material. It's not a sober Prisoner of War tale but about loss of innocence. A boy evolves from class privilege and entitlement into a man before our eyes (and before his time). Unfolding like a great novel in it's storytelling, and framed like a David Lean epic, Empire of the Sun is ripe for rediscovery. A lost classic.
0307716988|5|I had gotten the book as a Christmas present from my sister, however not from Amazon, since I'm sure she got it @ a bookstore & honestly, I just can't thank my sister enough for getting it for me.  As soon as I got it on Xmas Day, I ~IMMEDIATELY~ started reading it, however, I had to finish reading it when I got home from being out.  But anyways, I read the ENTIRE book all in ONE day & just could not put it down!  It's truly an AMAZING book & it's truly a MASTERPIECE(at least, in my opinion)    When you read this book, you really feel like as if you know the --REAL-- Michael Jackson, then compared to the trash that the media prints out.     Again, amazing book & I highly recommend this book for any Michael Jackson fan who has not read it.    I love you Michael! You're truly the best & always will be. <3
B00AAI7B7W|4|I'm in my 40's, but am not a big horror fan and had never seen this movie. I wanted to see what I had missed. So, a review on my thoughts on watching it, without being terribly influenced by all the original hoopla. I did think it was an excellent psychology thriller and it was so nice to see a complete and believable backstory in this sort of movie. I think it's held up to the passage of time very well and it seldom felt dated.<br /><br /> For the time period, the effects and make up were extremely well done, particularly the age make up on Father Merrin(I believe the actor was in his 40's). My only real complaint was that early into the possession what I think was supposed to be bruising on the little girl's face looked more like someone had drawn on her face with purple crayon. It just looked very silly and cartoony to me, but again this is coming from a more modern sensibility.<br /><br />What surprised me was that I didn't find it at all scary. I kept reading reviews saying that even today it will keep you from sleeping well for weeks on end. Also that there were sections where viewers would have to look away from the screen or might even become physically ill. I got none of that at all. As I've said I've seen very few horror movies, so I expected to be more bothered, but just wasn't. In fact , I took a nap right after watching it!  Some of this might be because I'm an atheist, so exorcism isn't particularly real to me. I would also assume that the extreme language would've been much more shocking in 1973 than it is today.<br /><br /> Overall, I enjoyed the film a great deal and I'm glad that I saw it. However I'll be sleeping just fine thank you!
B00AESN8XY|5|I cannot make any purchases on my kindle fire 1st gen. Once I click purchase, it just keeps loading and gets stuck. Please fix this.

B00RFHUSN0|4|Based on the Broadway play that debuted over 28 years ago, Disney tells the tale of various fairy tales from Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Rapunzel, and Snow White as they all come together in an unforgettable story. The film has a star studded cast with Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, James Corden, Emily Blunt, Johnny Depp, Tammy Blanchard, and Meryl Streep.<br /><br />It’s easy to describe the plot of the movie as basically your watching four classic stories all be bundled into one, but with a catch. The commonality is that the main characters from each all end up going through the woods. However, a Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) come to find that their house is cursed after the witch, played by Meryl Streep, requests four items to have the curse reversed. The items include: hair as yellow as gold, a red hood, a golden slipper, and a cow as white as snow. And so the adventure begins as we watch the main characters from each story run into the baker at various points in the film where he must acquire the items necessary so that he and his wife can have a child.<br /><br />Being that ‘Into The Woods‘ is a musical you come to expect a quite amount of singing and there is no let up in that department. It isn’t to say your not entertained by the music and the performances by the actors cause they all had a good time doing the film. What’s amazing is how they were able to intertwine story-lines that all seemed natural in a way that didn’t complicate understanding what was going on. I was very impressed by it and should do the same for audiences who go out to watch the film. One of the disappointments I had was with the limited appearance of Johnny Depp. His role was of the Big Bad Wolf as he goes after Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) who’d then be saved by the Baker. Although it was a small part for Depp he did a great job as always and even had a creepy side to him while stalking the little girl.<br /><br />You have to give it toJames Corden and Emily Blunt who held the movie for a good chunk along with Meryl Streep. They were brilliant and funny at the same time that gave for some good laughs in the process. I enjoyed watching them together as their chemistry really worked as they were likable from the start. And for Meryl Streep she is as talented as always. With her portrayal of the witch you could see different sides of her; especially when it came to her daughter Rapunzel. Although her mother comes off as evil by secluding her daughter from any visitors she does have a soft side as well. Overall, Streep took the driver’s seat yet again and blew her performance out of the water. Simply amazing.<br /><br />For the first two-thirds of the film your following the different tales up until the Baker acquires all the materials needed to lift the curse. However, when a giant descends from the clouds to avenge her husbands death due to Jack’s (Daniel Huttlestone) actions is when the film hits a snag. The movie literally stalls for a good 45 minutes as they try to stop the giant from wrecking havoc and giving her what she wants which is the boy Jack. A lot of dialogue takes place within that time and nothing is really happening. The film does a good job of faking the ending but then becomes unnecessary to continue after everything that’s happened.<br /><br />And then comes something that bothered me as the Baker’s wife is searching for young Jack but then runs into Cinderalla’s prince. For a Disney film you wouldn’t suspect that they wouldn’t go the route of an affair; especially when the Baker’s wife gives birth to her child. It just took me by surprise and had many in the audience with the same reaction as to how appropriate that would be for the movie and to what impact it would have on the story. I understand the times are changing and more and more films are succumbing to the trials and tribulations of the media and Hollywood but to have that scene in the movie was totallyunnecessary.<br /><br />If your looking for a holiday get-away with the kids and want to have a good time then I would recommend ‘Into The Woods‘. There’s plenty to admire and appreciate by the performances as you’ll get acquainted with the musical bits and become attached to many of the characters.
1582701709|4|I didn't get the dvd, preferring books, so unlike the other reviewers I am only commenting on the book. It was positive and uplifting. The first half of the book is powerful and energetic but I thought the second half faultered a little. It was somewhat repetitous and overdone after a while, I thought. Maybe the dvd was different and thats why these reviewers like it more than the book. However, I didn't think it merited buying both. The ideas here are not new, but they are presented well and it is definitely worth buying and reading.
B00D7Z4GQY|2|Boo!<br /><br />Very neo-victorian moralistic message. I should have judged the book by it's tea room cover and not it's great reviews.<br /><br />(strong) Moral: Your guy may be a killer or a cheat, but stay with him for the good of your six year old kid. Since I relate to the average six year old better than the adults in the story I would say, &#34;kill the toxic relationship and let the kid sort it out in therapy later.&#34;<br /><br />Children aren't cotton candy and haven't we learned already that you can't stay together for the sake of the kids?<br /><br />Boo! Boo!
B00005QZWI|4|There are only 2 Enya songs on this soundtrack, but that was the reason I bought it.  I did find many of the other instrumentals here entertaining (as much as orchestrated instrumentals can be entertaining), such as &quot;The Treason of Isengard&quot;, &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum&quot;, and &quot;Lothlorien&quot;; but to me, the real gems here are the two Enya songs &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot; and &quot;May it Be&quot;, which are breath-takingly beautiful both in instrumentation and vocals.  I listen to these songs often when I'm looking for relaxation and peace, and at times when I'm sad because these songs contain so much hope in the midst of despair, which is a world-wide cherished theme of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; books and movies.  I have liked an Enya song here and there, but nothing she has done compares to the beauty of these songs.
B009FZFONO|5|This is a great show. I have watched since the beginning and have not been let down yet. I can't wait to explore the graphic novels.
B0063IH60K|5|This is a great free app. The adverts aren't too annoying. would recommend this app to any one.<br />Think I convinced my dad to buy a Kindle Fire just from him playing this on mine.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|EXCELLENT book, excellent story, excellent end... WONDERFUL!  I think every American should read this!
B00181MHQU|4|I saw the original Broadway production and nothing can compare to the very first serious musical conducted by Leonard Bernstein, himself!  It was spellbinding.  But, the film is wonderful and the dancing, spectacular. Only problem is with the dubbing.  Not everything Natalie Wood sings is in sync.
B007FEFLTO|3|&#34;What is it, Boy?&#34;<br />&#34;You can marry the bitch now,&#34;<br />Then he died.<br /><br />The death of Boy was not exactly a literary master piece.
0385537131|5|I've read most if not all of Grisham's novels.  This one is a great read --- finished it off in a couple of days (including staying up late a night or two).<br /><br />With about 30 pages to go, I thought to myself &#34;how is he going to pull it all together --- there aren't that many pages left.&#34;<br /><br />He did it.  Time to start a re-read soon.
B006QVRX9S|5|I got this set mainly for the t-shirt.<br />The cds themselves were previously released.<br /> If you like the Beach Boys,get it.<br />One problem most fans already have these songs on cd on another compilation!
0802130208|4|finally arrived beautiful copy i have read  this in the passt and know I will love it
B00932DCS8|4|Great!
B00HGJ18C2|1|Only offer for fire phone, not enough options
B00CNQ7HAU|4|I liked it, love the way the story develops.<br />Jake and Ozzie, Hannah, opposing counsels .<br />Suspenseful and a delight to the imagination.<br />I admit bias as I like all Mr. Grisham's literary efforts.
0375836675|5|[[VIDEOID:mo1YTL9WMU7TRIG]]Ok.. That wasn't a really good description or review... lol  But anyway, I think it is a nice indication. I did started, I am in the middle and is involving.. Have a try!
B0094BB4TW|5|Works perfectly.
B004T8OIT8|5|This strap allows me to travel light and comfortably with a tripod. I commute on a crowded train to work every week day. I've tried different solutions like the straps on the Langly bag, but found that with the tripod horizontal, I'd bump into things and people. With this strap, the tripod lies either perfectly vertical with a backpack, or diagonal across my back without one. I don't bump into people anymore. If I want to travel real light and rugged, I can easily climb on top of walls and not worry about my tripod.
0525478817|5|Great
B00TJ68PYY|5|All the songs were great, really knocked it out out of the park.
B00B5HQKNI|5|Best Bond film thus far.  Daniel Craig is by far the best Bond and there have been many great Bond actors.  Story was great and a great ride from beginning to end.  Action-adventure great but also great story.  Superbly done.
B007SGLZP8|5|This one is a page turner! John Grisham keeps your interest through the whole story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.
B0039UTDFG|1|I just don't get it. Why replace the marvelous narration by David Attenborough with Oprah's? Do the folks at the Discovery Channel think that Americans can't understand Attenborough's accent? Other than trying to cash in on Oprah's name, I can't think of a reason why they decided to ruin this incredible series. I'll pass on this version and stick to the original BBC release the same way I did with Planet Earth.
B00I75EROU|5|This is a toroughly enjoyable book. Perfect plot. Wonderful characters. I  couldn't stop reading. Thank you, Mr King,you never let me down.
B00AHGSVKS|5|I found Childhood's End very satisfying as a science fiction story. It was different. I enjoyed it very much.
B00A6CCF0K|4|Felt like I was part of the story. Started reading while in Bradenton and Tampa. Had been in Wilmington and was also born with a Caul. All key points in the book.
B000FC1HBY|4|This genre is a deviation from my usual spectrum of reading material...and I am loving it!  King of Thrones was intriguing and dark and full of well developed characters so, I am now almost finished with book two--A Clash of Kings and I am looking forward to the next installment of the series!
B00BUT5I84|5|Arrived with no damage. One happy customer
B0028RXXFC|5|i am so enjoying this series, The box set is absolutely beautiful.....thank you so much will be looking for more<br />t
B00005JLDW|2|... Now audiences are presented with something called REIGN OF FIRE starring Christian Bale (who is fine casting) and Matthew McCaughnahay (who seems to chew his lines as much as he enjoys rubbing his bald head and chews his cigar). Too bad for the dragon. He has little to do. While the adds made this film out to be like BLACK HAWK DOWN meets DRAGONSLAYER, the actual plot is a total letdown. The effects are good. The 'castle' is a reject from some old ROAD WARRIOR film. And the supporting cast are simply in the picture to become toasted weenies for the dragon's breath. The lead female is wasted unless you enjoy just watching a pretty face and nothing else. I love a good dragon story. I love dragons. They are the flip side of the unicorn. Bad vs. good. Dragons fascinate. ...
B000000H40|4|D*mn, this was brutal back in 1990! What still strikes me about this record is John Tardy's low powerful gutteral growl. You just have to hear that.<br />On successive listens other pieces of quality will begin to appear, like the playing of legendary death-metal guitarist James Murphy, or tight and inventive drumming (if I'm not mistaken, that's John's brother Donald behind the kits). The hardest thing about this album is telling where the track ends and the next one starts.<br />Few bands from Florida managed to put out a better death album. While I still think the succeeding Obituary's &quot;The End Complete&quot; is way better record.
B00H43WOAK|1|I call things as I see them, I hate to condemn a product, but this one I must.<br />Inferior build quality, subpar performance and terrible connectivity (running an iPhone 6plus)<br />They may have brought this to market to soon, nothing about it works<br />Buy the Omron
B000XUBFE2|2|Too many words on insignificant non-events.<br />Unrelated dreams and imaginations.<br />&#34;Ten more words required!! Why more meaningless words? ...... ..
6304578482|5|Go see this movie with three or four of your close girl friends &amp; I guarantee you'll have fun! This is a fabulous movie. It is soooo funny. Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino work together to create a hilarious movie that  is perfect for girl bonding.
B0027MJU00|5|Outstandingly good book! This book will keep you on the edge of your seat. From the very beginning to the end it will keep you wondering what really happened. Another success for Gillian Flynn! Please keep them coming.
B007DIQC90|5|I had never heard of this band until I went on amazon, searched for bands I like and this was a suggestion based upon other bands I like such as Band of horses, iron and wine, the shins, coldplay, florence and the machine, brand new etc. I listened to a few songs and they are so good! I mean the whole album is fantastic. Its like a combination of indie/folk/irish...You know you have found a good band when you have never heard of them and you listen to the album and every song is awesome.
B003Y5H542|5|When I first saw this film in the theater, I remember thinking that these are quite possibly the ugliest characters I've seen yet in a family-animated tale. I was not impressed, but my kids & wife loved it.  Upon my second viewing I looked deeper and came to realize that I agree with most of the other reviews here:  this is truly a brilliant film.    PROs:  STORY.  This movie is an original story without a Pixar/Disney formula driving it.  It has a lot of smart & slaptick humor in it with comic commentary.  EASTER EGGs.  An Easter egg is something hidden in a game/movie/media that is a link to another game/movie/media.  VOICE ACTING.  Johnny Depp is outstanding as RANGO.  Also great support by Ned Beatty as the Mayor Tortoise & Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake.  DIRECTION.  Solid direction from Gore Verbinski. He's inproved upon his previous work in the Pirates of the Caribbean films.  CONs:  ANIMATION.  The charaters in this film are ugly CGI.  [But that's part of the charm for me]  BEANS.  The female heroine is named Beans.  I still don't get it.     I give this film my highest recommendation for families and animation fans alike.  [semi-spoilers] In the beginning when Rango is on the convertible car windshield, it is Johnny Depp driving the car from \\"Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas\\".  I noted several other eggs from Sergio Leone Westerns to Pirates 3.  I'll be looking for more the next time we watch it.
B00HY7VU60|5|Highly addictive
B007J4T2G8|4|Good book, very intriguing. I found myself wanting to read it constantly! I am ready to read the next one!
B0000DD7LB|5|Who ever said that Britney is all fake, doesn't write her songs who cares her music rocks! I dont care what those other people said because if they don't like her music that is O.K. because they can go listen to their CLASSICAL music I personaly almost did buy this because of their response but then I thought who cares what they think? If I like Britneys Music I can buy it  period. If they don't like her music they have no buisness on this site they can go to what ever site they like better because you know what I don't go to pages of singers I don't like and rate them baddley so why should they get to do that? No wait let me guess it's a frekin' free country am I right? I thought so.
B0094BB4TW|4|I haven't had any problems that others mentioned in their reviews. my only complaint is that the brews feed has a bit of a delay when updating for new stories.
B000OY8NII|5|I have fallen in LOVE with the characters of this show. This is a must buy for those coming to the show late. It fills in the missing text.I have addicted my friends to this show, Where is Season Two?
B00EY8BRGU|5|This one ranks up there with The Illusionist as a great magic movie ... it's more flashy and showy than the darker themed Illusionist, but still an awesome watch!
B008KRBTU0|5|Fantastic game for all ages! Six yr. olds can stomp adults!
B00J2VSS0C|1|It's been WELL over 24 hours and this app has STILL  ''NOT''  downloaded to my Kindle.  Keeps giving me the message 'In the process of downloading, may take a while.' As far as I'm concerned, their ''a while'' is UP.  Tired and turned off waiting for it.  Take it back, I don't want it.  It's not worth it.
B00RL9WRAE|5|Great movie with excellent character building! I like a move with story line that make you guess a little about the past life of a character, and this delivers! The only drawback was the last 30 seconds of the movie....I did not understand it. Still a good use of your time. 5 Stars!<br />Cheers, Ty
B00CNQ7HAU|4|Another great Grisham legal classic!
B000QRIGLC|5|A Thanks to all.<br />Along with the amazing story of Marcus, is his amazing recovery given to him by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, and his wife Anita, who took him into their home, and gave him the help personal, and medical help he needed so badly. God Bless Marcus for his service, and The Gov. and his wife for answering his call for help.
B004SBS8LA|5|Rovio has done it again; Absolutely wonderful game.  I loved the first Angry Birds when it was released back in 2009.  When AB: Seasons released, I was so eager to get that version and now the same with AB: Rio.  Very nice change in pace from having pigs in the first two, but it is again just a great as the first two and it was free!  It is a shame that Amazon went this route and is denying this great addition to the Angry Birds family to everyone worldwide.
B009JR5JTM|4|Saw this film as a kid an just loved it. I bit slow, but fun. Sharon Tate of course is a beauty to behold. I personally liked the sound track. It's a fun film. I recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5|Never been a reader, but from the first book of this trilogy I was hooked. Most people say these books are just reading porn. To me it was something different... A true love story and I read the whole series within a week.. Loved it!!
B00FAPF5U0|5|Very addictive and fun! Few games have ever held my interest for more than a week and this is definitely one!
B007SYWFRM|5|Ice Age is one of my favorite movies. And to be able to have an game and it to be so addictive is even better. Me and my husband fight over who is going to it all the time. U have to get this game.
B00DUGCLY4|4|This is fun and relaxing, easy and fun for all the family.  I can do this game anywhere.  Fun to play with the grandkids.
B002O5M4SA|5|I got the blu-ray disk which features both theatrical and extended versions and I have seen both.. Definitely get the extended version. The added footage does so much to explain and smooth out the story and the relationship (or lack thereof) between Leon and the girl.  The added footage made the story flow more easily. I will never watch the \\"choppy\\" theatrical version again..
B003UESJEM|4|I just watched this movie yesterday on video on demand in HD. It was pretty good. The problem with this movie is that it was not promoted or advertised nearly enough. I think they only realeased this movie in just over a hundred theaters nation wide? And I never saw a commercial for this film. This movie could have done much better at the box office with more support. Definately worth renting.
B0001HAISG|5|A great movie in every aspect: great directing, amazing special effects, wonderful acting, good script, music, amazing sets and costumes and flying sequences that put the Superman films to shame. This is probably one of if not the best adaptation of J. M. Barrie classic children's story. I think the director and producers tried to put on it as much of the book as possible, since it is very long (almost 2 hours), as Peter Jackson did in Lord Of The Rings.<br /><br />This a wonderful family movie, much better than Disney's animated version of the tale. And perhaps because it was made in Australia with British cast and director aren't very well known it didn't sit well with American audiences.  There are no sing-song sequences. Some scenes may be a little intense for the very little ones,like swordfights and the crocodile, there is a little romance between Peter and Wendy as well, but is very cute and completely innocent. The story is very well brought to life and you'll never find a dull moment.<br />The DVD has lots of bonus materials with in depth look at behind the scenes and other features. My only complaint is that you cannot skip or foward the previews in order to get to the main movie.<br />I give it 5 stars, worthy of having in your collection of family films adapted from books.
B000C25VNM|5|I have many versions of the book purchased over the last 25 years and the illustrations/imagery she created in this volume are wonderful.  I would recommend this edition.
B00JKGYSAI|5|Ed Sheeran is the best romantic song writer singer of modern music. I absolutely love &#34;Just Thinking&#34; I tear up every time I hear it.

B00F8L2VO4|5|Duolingo rocks my socks. I'm learning German and picked up more in two weeks than I did from taking a whole 4 years of Spanish back in High School. The progression of learning is perfect to me, if I get lost I go back and review. I have this on my phone, PC and tablets so wherever I go I am constantly using this. I'm addicted! Oh, the real kicker, free! No adds, no gimmicks, no stopping your progression and make you buy more content, just free and well thought out and designed language learning!
B003F3FJQO|4|Thomas and the Gladers survived the maze and it's horrors and managed to escape it but is what waits for them outside really any better than what they had? The Gladers thought that they had finally gotten away and could try their luck in this new ruined world. But they soon find out that WICKED is far from done with them and their misterious and sinister tests.<br />Thomas and his friends are told that they have the Flare a disease that will eventually strip them of all their human emotions. They have to travel through the Scorch (a desert with a city full of people gone crazy because of the Flare) and find the Safehaven to get a promised cure from WICKED. Ofcourse they have no solid proof that there really is a cure for those who make it but they don't have a choice. Going through the Scorch which is no better than the Maze and even more unpredictable is their only hope to survive.<br /><br />I liked this book, it was exciting, full of suspense and mysterious since I'm curious to find out the real reason behind WICKED's tests. I like the characters even more than I did in the first book, especially Minho even though he can sometimes be hasty and act without thinking everything through. But what I did not like as much was the love and relationship part of the book, I personally thought that it only added unnecessary drama. Overall I found this book just as good as the first one which I really liked.
0307010856|4|This book is adorable, and my son loves it. The only reason my review is four stars is because the golden section on the top binding was torn and misplaced.
B00006AW2P|5|I believe this was the first Stones album released in the US. It was one of my favorites as a kid and still is. It stands out for its single-minded obsession with American R&B. Nearly all the songs are covers of minor R&B hits and the production is pretty simple, emphasizing the early Stones' direct and hard-edged approach to this material. The Stones do a great job and put their stamp on a broad selection of good tunes from Slim Harpo's \\"I'm a King Bee\\" to Rufus Thomas's \\"Walkin' the Dog.\\"<br /><br />Jimmy Reed and Chuck Berry are the main influences. Reed is represented by \\"Honest I Do\\" with its memorable guitar figure and surprisingly effective cymbal crashes (both from the original) and \\"Little by Little,\\" a fine remake of Reed's Shame, Shame, Shame. Keith recycles Reed and Berry licks on a number of other tracks and cooks up a spicy pot of his own. Poor Ian Stewart contributes mightily on piano and Phil Spector puts in a cameo on maracas.<br /><br />Berry's \\"Oh, Carol\\" is an album highlight. Keith does a bang-up job on the riffs and the solo and Mick's singing is, as always, eccentric but irresistible. Slim Harpo's \\"King Bee\\" features some wonderful guitar work by Keith and Brian. The track lacks the sinuous, hypnotic quality of Harpo's version but succeeds on its own terms. Rufus Thomas's \\"Walkin' the Dog\\" is also outstanding with a striking hook, a brilliant solo by Keith, and a virtuosic display of dog whistling by someone or other. Mick always sounds slightly like he's brain damaged but its a good kind of brain damage. The story used to be that the end of Mick's tongue had been chopped off in an accident! Whatever -- there had to be some explanation for that voice! \\"Route 66\\" is another toe-tapping Berryish rocker though actually by Bobby Troup. The version here is great but my favorite is the live version on December's Children.<br /><br />\\"Tell Me\\" is an original and the sole track that could not be called R&B. It was one of the earliest Stones AM radio hits. It's an atmospheric song featuring Brian's mandolin, a tambourine back-beat, and Charley's double-bass rhythm (DUM -- dum DUM), which was a British Invasion trademark back in the day (for another example listen to \\"World Without Love\\").<br /><br />This is a hard album to rate. In retrospect, the Stones are not the equals, when it comes to R&B, of their heroes. Yet as a kid I preferred these Stones versions to the originals. They are certainly harder edged and feature Mick's charisma and a lot of outstanding guitar from Keith and Brian. All the Stones play extremely well, in fact. I don't think any other British Invasion band did as much or as well in covering the full spectrum of American R&B and making it their own in a good way.
B00GAVJ77K|5|A very nice app and it's even for free my android was at risk now I know everything happening and got more space 😊
0141301104|5|It was funny, and I couldn't put it down. You wouln't expect the ending. I recommend it for all ages!!!! :)
B0002F6BRE|4|This was an enjoyable family film. Between the gum eating scene, \\"For that Special Someone\\" and Buddy with his elf father, this movie is hilarious. I bought it when it first came out, and this is the kind of Christmas movie that you can watch anytime of the year.  <br /> <br />The only problem with this movie is the \\"love story.\\" Though sweet, it's a little sappy.  <br /> <br />But the relationship between Buddy and his biological family is sweet. The father, who isn't exactly accepting, the \\"mother\\" who loves the idea (though I wouldn't be happy if I found that my husband had fathered a son out of wedlock) and the little brother who is able to have fun once in his life. <br /> <br />If you enjoy great comedy, then you should give this movie a try. (The special features are great, also!)
B009IEXKXI|5|A great read with tons of technical detail nicely balanced with a plot that reaches out to the deep inner survival instinct in all of us. I was hooked from page 1.
B0058Z4NR8|5|These guys are outstanding historians and wonderful economists.  This work will give all of those who  do not have an institutional view of what civilizations really are and how they work an entirely new and easy-to-understand way of looking at the world and its economic and social complexities.  Those interested in the effectiveness of foreign aid and public policy in general should read this book. Spend a little time with the works with the great economists such as Hayek and Keynes if you must, but read Why Nations Fail first.  It will help you separate the sense from the nonsense.  Let us hope that every member of congress reads this book and takes its lessons to heart
B000006TRV|5|this is the best recording of anything ever.
B00005JKES|5|I love Twin Peaks, the creepy weird town created by David Lynch and Mark Frost.  WHERE IS #2? and Pilot episode releases?  <br />Just hearing the Theme song makes the hairs of the back of my neck freeze.  FREAKY........
0060527978|5|As a young man, I found Warrior of the Light to be truly amazing. It didn't present many new ideas, but delivered the same messages in a way that was extremely accessible for me. Coelho uses the setting of a warrior on his personal journey to share his lessons on life. While most spiritual messages seem to encourage suppression of male energy, Coelho uses the warrior archetype and taps into the primal spirit of man, telling us it is okay to let the warrior out. This really spoke to me and integrated two parts of myself that hadn't seen eye to eye. Obviously this book isn't for everyone, but for the right audience it is a grand-slam.
B0030MM68O|5|Great movie
B009YN2M7S|5|Great book. I hope the movie is just as good! The characters were brought to life and I was surprised by the revelation at the end.
B00005K9QP|4|I stumbled onto this one when reviewing a Yardbirds CD. This was the group that Eric Clapton was with (although very shortly) after leaving the Yardbirds and before forming Cream. His guitar work makes this album/CD worth listening to. Some really great stuff, very bluesy. No hit singles on this record but probably a must for Eric Clapton fans. A great classic album, a best kept secret.
B006ID6NDQ|4|&#34;The Nazi Officer's Wife&#34; was a very good book.  Reading about World War ll and the holocaust from Edith's perspective was very different than most books about those subjects.  I enjoyed it greatly.
B00KA7JIII|3|Beautiful art but for the price you're paying there aren't enough levels. It's definitely an awesome game (I have to day one of the most original and we'll though out mobile games of all time) but come on. Give us more stuff to do! Give us more levels!
B004U8VX2M|5|I loved this program when it first aired. My sisters and I would faithfully watch it every week on Masterpiece Theater on channel 11. I will never forget that. So glad amazon had this available so I could watch it again. Jean Marsh is great as Rose. Always liked her as an actress. Would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs back in the 1970's when it first aired. British living in the 1900's for wealthy families was always fun to see for me.
038553082X|4|This is a very good and comprehensive book about the brain as it it now being understood by research written by a renowned author and professor of physics.  The  language of the book is nonscientific and geared toward the popular science reader.  As science learns how to research the brain with advanced technology, its organisation and mechanisms are just starting to come into view (literally) and who couldn't be fascinated by this subject.  This book both lets you see how far we have come and how far we have to go.  It's probably like medieval men wondered how it might be possible to get to the moon - they were just starting to acquire the inconceivable amount of knowledge, but they were making progress as primitive as it seemed.  I was surprised to learn that scientists so far have discovered about 300 different regions of the brain with distinctive functions.  There will be a great many more no doubt.  One aspect of the book is its speculative nature.  It sometimes reminded me of an old Popular Science magazine cover depicting what a futuristic world would look like.  This &#34;could&#34; happen or we &#34;may&#34; see something in the future is the theme throughout parts of the book.  There were certain things that my limited imagination just couldn't agree with like spending $100,000,000 for a quadriplegic to control an arm via a mesh on his cortex somewhere.  If it was me I'd shut off the alarms on my breathing machine and pull the plug.  But I guess speculation is just part of this subject matter and this science is so young that speculation is mostly what we have.  The book was very interesting and easy to read and I would recommend it to anyone interested in their brains (the book mentions we all actually have 2 of them).
B001DM3Q2S|5|How can you go wrong with this all star cast? Cusack and Freeman. I have been a Cusack fan since Grosse Pointe Blank and can't say enough about Freeman. They play off each other well here. The blu-ray looks really good on this one, I was pleasently suprised with my purchase of this sleeper thriller.

B000002UAX|4|First off, let's get one thing straight, the star ratings are as follows... <br /> <br />5 Stars... Hands down, the quintessential rank of superiority. Only the elite should apply. <br />4 Stars... Excellent <br />3 Stars... Good <br />2 Stars... Fair <br />1 Star.... Poor <br />0 Stars... What the hey am I reviewing this for? <br /> <br />Now that we got this out of the way, and maybe people will understand a little better how to rate for their reviews, on with the business of The White Album. <br /> <br />I bought this on cassette when I was 17.  My musical tatstes turned it's complete attention to The Beatles at that point and what better way to start the collection than buying what ended up being a pivitol point in my musical vocabulary. <br /> <br />I still have the cassette to this day.  It's buried away somewhere amidst a school of boxes but it's got sentimental value to me.  These songs defined a point in my life and more than that, the Beatles made some great music at this time.  <br /> <br />The White Album also ranks 2nd in my favorite Beatles albums only to be beat out by Revolver.  I know, most of us don't have our own ranking system when it comes to the music we listen to.  We usually shrug it off and say \\"Well, each album has it's own strong point!\\"   <br /> <br />Although I rank Revolver as one of the greatest sound recordings of all time, I don't give The White Album that sort of personal notoriety.  I do think it's a great collection of songs and the Beatles were masters of their craft at this point.  I rank it as a great Beatles album.
B007F8I64C|3|The review of this book \\"Mein Kampf\\" is quite adventitious because the judgement of this book will be reviewed on several accounts. The book does not follow an outline. The paragraphs are repeated at length by introducing the same subjects over and over again. He starts this narrative after being in prison on October, 1924 with a sentence of five years of that amount he served eighteen months. During this time he wrote about his stay in Austria that had an Alliance with Germany. He was born into a middle class family and he wanted to go to art school that was violently opposed by his father, his father died which released him from that problem. After his mother died he went to Vienna to architecture school, that was a desperate time  since he had only a small amount of money earned intermittently by whatever job he could find, the lack of funds threw him in the slums with the very poor people. During this time he form his opinions about Jews, Negroes and the Socialist party and other political groups.<br /><br />He went to war and fought and was under the impression that Germany should have won the war had it not been for the Revolution of the Austians in 1918, Jews and Socialistic party. He gains employment and this is when he started to compile the information on political oganizations. He advanced his egotistical thoughts to help find a new oaganization called National Socialistic Workers Party.<br /><br />I find this book to be very challenging, because of the authors' rambling thoughts, his writings are based on circular thoughts, and from arm chair philosophers. It is a very interesting book becauee it allows the reader the opportunity to discover the orgins of some of the thoughts that continue as predjudice and racism today.<br /><br />Not only did he form opinions, but they were biased, illogical, and meant to motivate the masses<br /><br />SPR<br /><br />[[ASIN:0394700449 The Anatomy of Revolution]]<br />[[ASIN:B005FOIRFG The Psychology of Revolution]]<br />[[ASIN:0982604025 Angry Mobs and Founding Fathers: The Fight for Control of the American Revolution]][[ASIN:0521586003 Revolutions 1789-1917 (Cambridge Perspectives in History)]]/>[[ASIN:0982604025 Angry Mobs and Founding Fathers: The Fight for Control of the American Revolution]][[ASIN:0521586003 Revolutions 1789-1917 (Cambridge Perspectives in History)]]
B000HIVIOW|5|What makes this video so special is the illustrations and the fact there are NO WORDS (with the exception of the micro intro by the author). We also have the book and the plush doll. I could watch this over and over - a nice reprieve from all the holidaze noise and chatter! Ahhhhh.
B000002BSG|3|For us Jamiroquai fans who love the instrumental and creative side to the band, Travelling Without Moving is the album that begins a total descent into 'jazz-pop', that Jamiroquai, by the two latest albums have turned into. The album does deserve 3 stars due to its' obvious merits in terms of accessability. Virtual Insanity is the best song on the album, and one expects the album to develop depth and innovation wise, but it simply never occurs. One of the main reasons seems to be in the bands increased use of strings and guitars, rather than a greater range of horns and synths, which makes Jamiroquai's music less challenging and gives it an easy cuddly feel. <BR>Overall the album is a collection of catchy songs, but with little experimentation, sadly unlike Space Cowboy and Emergency.

1400032717|5|A clever and engaging story that catches the reader up from the very first page. At first it is a bit jarring that the narrator seems to be digressing in all sorts of directions, but one quickly adapts as this is the personality on is dealing with. Once the reader learns to flow with the narrator, the frustration eases off, and the ride is very enjoyable.  <br /> <br />This book is one to open the eyes and look at the world as a segment of society does that most of us don't normally pay much attention to. We don't interact as Christopher does. We don't worry about the same things he does. We are not fascinated about the same things. But we soon learn to live and see things his way, and it's pretty amazing. <br /> <br />This book made me laugh and almost brought me to tears. I could feel the frustration of Christopher's parents and their love for him. I wanted to love him as well. For a book just over 200 pages long, it packs quite a wallop! Mark Haddon does a wonderful job opening up a very different world to those of not normally exposed to it! <br />

0743201140|3|In reading some of the reviews about this book people seem to go back to one reoccuring theme which embraces the initial concept of relying on your strengths for success.  That premise is the cornerstone of the book, but it gets bogged down from there with semantics.  You MUST go back to Donald Clifton's very first book...&quot;Soar With Your Strengths&quot;, written about ten years ago.  This is the book that gives the general parameters of their original concept and although broad in scope, is very effective in changing your outlook on life.  As someone who makes a living out of speaking to people, I use this book as the premise of my presentations and you'd be amazed how overwhelmed people are when they hear the principals of that first book.  Although this book has some good moments, it doesn't justify the work.  Give people the premise and let them apply it to their own lives. In the end, the authors had it right the very first time.
B00GX59QO2|5|Lots of fun.  Love how these characters play off of each other throughout the movie.  More bullets fly than during the Battle of the Bulge.
B005GFPZYK|2|I found this book sensationalized, very little substance to it. An account of an amazing life; sure, not much else to it than a play-by-play
B001JRB16U|5|I got this for my granddaughter, age six, for Christmas.  Her mother wrote that they watched one evening as a family and again the next morning, and spent the whole day singing the songs from it.  It is good, clean, delightful entertainment!

0316066524|5|INFINTE JEST. (1996) David Foster Wallace.<br /><br />Everything you have heard, read, and that has been said about Infinite Jest is true. Should YOU read it? Is the only relevant question. This book is work--it's going into the gym and the classroom. (It is 1079 pages and holding it requires strength and strategy. And Kindle, iPod, or cd isn't a remedy because of the classroom aspect--you will want to highlight, and write in the margins; and it requires two bookmarks--one for the body and one for the endnotes.) This book, though a novel, is a journey into the mind of David Foster Wallace and is one long suicide (Wallace hung himself 12 years after publication at age 46) note. But it is not grim and dour. It is, at times, gruesome and frightening, yes, and also funny, and always insightful into the human condition and especially the American pursuit of happiness and pleasure along with the concurrent escape from discomfort and pain. And mostly about the inherent and ironic conflict between pleasure and pain--how the relief of pain into pleasure ultimately creates more pain, which causes one to seek more relief/pleasure, i.e. a psychological and physiological trap--a cage with no way out ... except maybe through a Twelve-step program which is SO boring so as to be not worth the effort. And then, there is reincarnation--which DFW never calls by name (something he does with the Psychoanalytic Reaction Formation, also) but which plays a huge part in the story. Both.<br /><br />Should YOU read it? I rank it as one of the four best books of all time. I lived with it for three weeks pretty much not doing anything else but reading and thinking about what Wallace was saying. I stopped drinking (One theme is addiction) and didn't bother to go out or watch any entertainment or do any work of my own (writing). It, the book, moved into my mind--took up residence in my apartment, became my roommate. Of course that is ironic also because the book's first name was \\"A FAILED ENTERTAINMENT,\\" and the book is the most entertaining thing I've ever experienced - passively; but then it is work so it's not completely passive, as say watching something - \\"spectation\\" Wallace calls it. What the book is is inside the brain of a particular personality who happens to be a genius with a photographic memory (which again he doesn't name but describes: \\"Hal [a central character] can summon a kind of mental Xerox of anything he'd ever read and basically read it all over again, at will, ... .\\" (Pg. 797) I think parts of Wallace surface in all of the characters (there are scores of them) and what he does is to debate through interior and exterior dialogue, btw & w/in characters. Ideas/thoughts/philosophy (and of course this is discussed. He also critiques his own writing style via this, his technique,) Wallace's personality is, if categorized by the trait theory of The Big Five (OCEAN) [I think]: Extremely high O (open) slightly less but still very high C (conscientiousness), somewhat low E (extraversion, i.e  Introverted), somewhat low A (agreeableness) and somewhat above average N (neuroticism). Add to that an extremely high I.Q. with that memory thing, a large physical presence (6'2, 200lbs.) and a cute and interesting face and you've got the man. If you think you can relate to those characteristics--you'll probably be taken by, and drawn into the novel as I was. [About being high O. Highly Open persons tend to be bored by people below them on the continuum, which looks like arrogance, elitism, snobbery, creative showoffishness, etc. Openness is the trait most associated with creativity. They also tend to be low in A (a `pussified' trait) for obvious reasons.]<br /><br />That by way of introduction. Briefly now, a look at Infinite Jest by way of the six elements of a story.<br /><br />Title: Perfect, either one. Defines the book.<br /><br />Plot: There is only a very almost inconsequential one. It is sometimes a distraction. It is about the relationship btwnthe USA and Canada and the use and disposal/reuse of energy and territory. In an interesting way - it is woven into the pleasure/pain conundrum and so therefore worth some consideration. The personal and political intersect with, I think, some very bizarre drug enhanced imaginative thoughts and ideas. Free association.<br /><br />Characterization: There are three main protagonists. Hal Incandenza, a 17 yr.old, privileged white boy, at an elite youth tennis academy in Massachusetts; founded by his father (alcoholic) and run by his mother (OCD). Hal is addicted to marijuana and nicotine and a gifted and highly rated tennis prospect. He has younger residents/students/players he mentors, as well as two brothers who play prominent roles. Don Gately, a 29 yr. old, staff resident of a halfway house for recovering substance abusers, located adjacent to the tennis academy. Don is 9 months sober and oversees other recovering addicts. He is recovering from addiction to downers and a life of crime. Remy Marathe, (of unknown age) a legless Canadian, and member of a group of wheel chair assassins involved with the USA v. Canada's political/environmental/territorial mess. There are numerous sub-characters within these three facets of the story - the tennis academy, the halfway house, and the governments of the two countries. There is a prominent female character, Joelle van Dyne. She is involved with Orin Incandenza (Hal's older brother); James Incandenza (Hal's father); Mario Incandenza (Hal's younger, deformed, brother); and Don. She is also a person of interest i/r/t Remy's work. She is addicted to crack cocaine and a girl of exceptional beauty--the P.G.O.A.T.--the Prettiest Girl On The Planet. To me, none of the characters were all that likable.<br /><br />Setting: The story takes place mostly in and around Boston, Mass. USA in the near future [The book being written in the mid 90's.] year of 2007. It is spring through fall and there is rain, humid heat, and snow. The \\"action\\" is mostly in and around the tennis academy, the halfway house and the seedy underbelly of Boston. There is also the desert SW around Tucson. Wallace is the best I've ever read of painting landscape and cityscape with words. He is also the best at the littlest details of people behavior. [Reading him is in some ways like opening your eyes to the world for the first time.] The zeitgeist is a future that revolves around telecommunications and entertainment, both voice and video. It is eerily accurate i/r/t where we are today. [It was written pre Internet & wireless explosion.]<br /><br />Style: This is maybe where most people simply go batty and throw the book against the wall. There is no consistent POV or voice save for Wallace's. He breaks every rule (for writing) there is ... and yet he pulls it off. All the characters pretty much talk the same, with the same idiosyncrasies, i.e. Wallace's. He uses conjoined conjunctions up the wazoo: \\"And so but... That thus this is why... So and but that night's next ...\\" etc. He repeats words: \\"Then he considered that this was the only dream he could recall where even in the dream he knew that it was a dream, much less lay there considering the fact that he was considering the up-front dream quality of the dream he was dreaming.\\" [then he adds, mocking himself] \\"It quickly got so multileveled and confusing that his eyes rolled back in his head.\\" (pg. 830) Events are not lineal. Sometimes events and persons don't become clear for 100s of pages. He makes up words. He uses obscure words. He uses acronyms up the wazoo. He uses endnotes that are stories in and of themselves. The endnotes sometimes explain the main story. There can be page upon page w/o a paragraph break. His segues sometimes are just barely, and then ... the sidebar has next to nothing to do with anything except - the central theme(s). This is the where the personality factor of Openness factors in--if you're not of a like mind/brain--it'll drive you nuts. The storyhas no ending, the book ends.<br /><br />Theme: The strongest case for reading this book. DFW says the book is about: Tennis; Addiction; & Entertainment. It is that, and more. Some readers struggle with the minutiae of tennis. But the game of tennis and the discipline required is a metaphor for life, in Wallace's mind. This is what is taught at the academy, and also all the AA stuff, characters and references. Delay of gratification and effort and struggle are their own rewards ... blah,blah, blah and yada, yada. Life is a GAME and it is not about you or who wins that matters. Ironically--nothing matters. Addiction is covered from head to toe, from its genesis to its usually horrific conclusion. You think you're not, addicted, maybe you should read this book for that reason. Entertainment and the individual and that relationship- ship's- ships' (Wallace's style is infectious) exploitation by design and by fate (Never named.). Then there is the issue of control, choice, and self-determination, which is the underpinning of The Game, Addictions, & Entertainment. Is it (control) really just a delusion? So why not - seek pleasure and submit to ecstasy? And running beneath the underpinning is all the unnamed Freudian stuff (Also, never named.)--that childhood decides. That even the best of intentions can have disastrous consequences, and not even here to get into all the horror of the ubiquitous neglectful, abusive, and incestuous parenting stuff that Wallace explores. And finally [not really possible] Wallace's take on reincarnation--that YOU will be killed by a woman, and that that woman will be your mother in your next life.<br /><br />Got time? Time to explore who you are and why you do what you do--to step outside your cage and study yourself as subject? Take a vacation ... haha.y house and the seedy underbelly of Boston.

B0076HNMU0|5|This show was innovative when it first hit the small screen and it remains relevant today. The characters are unique in a way that makes you remember them for years to come and has lead me to make comparisons to characters that try and fail to reach the depth found in Twin Peaks.

B000MLNUBI|2|The front and back crystal (glass) is actually plastic.  Had it only for a few days and already have scratches on it.  Decided to confirm this theory by applying a  soft piece of steel across the back cover and it SCRATCHES VERY EASY.  I mean even some cheap battery powered watches I have, have actual glass on the front that does not scratch, but these are plastic???  For the amount of money I paid for this watch, this is very disappointing. Hoping for the mechanical parts to last a long time, however reading all the reviews have my doubts now.  What happened to all the old reliable watches our parents and grand parents used to have that would last a lifetime???<br />I wish I came across these reviews earlier, would not have bought it if I knew.

0525953728|5|This is a really great story that tells the tale of a young man dreaming to become a Navy SEAL and rising to the ranks of the elite. Does not just focus on Bin Laden but does tell those events exactly as they occurred. Trully a great story and a book that was hard to put down.
B00000HZFH|5|Major label status has improved BTS. Their indy work, to me, was a bit spotty and at times indulgent. Now the guitar majesty of Doug Martsch is focused, and the songwriting improved. A fine addition to anyone's catalog!
B004EBT5CU|5|I had heard so many great things about this album and this woman. Now I know why, since getting it for Mother's Day. Her sound is unique and very heartfelt. You really feel the emotion in her music. Even my kids fell in love with this album and have their favorite songs! It's nice to not have to skip over songs for objectionable lyrics, too! I highly recommend it.

Do not be afraid of the title all the dances were done in great taste matter of fact if they had this burlesque show around my area I would go see it.
B003G4W49C|4|Three-and-a-half stars would be a more accurate rating for me. I enjoyed the story, and appreciated the way the author explored ideas from battle training, to battle ethics. The time spent in the battle school (the body of this work) is fascinating. While some consider it a strong point for the book, I on the other hand had difficulty relating to most of the characters.

When you first buy the CD, Julian Casablacas's voice can be barely heard but as you listen to it more the voice grows stronger. That may sound strange. This is that type of CD where you can listen to all of the songs instead of skipping songs. All of the songs are excellent. This CD inspired me to want to learn to play the guitar and drums.<br />Is This It - It starts out a little slow and somewhat borring but it grows on you and you will in time love it.<br />The Modern Age - An excellent song. Great rhythm and lyrics.<br />Soma - Absolutely wonderful. Good lyrics.<br />Barely Legal - Lots of different ryhthms makes this song very interesting. The drums are very good on this song.<br />Someday - One of my favorites. I love the words. I could listen to this song all day.<br />Alone, Together - Very mysterious. The words are very honest. Great guitar.<br />Last Nite - Very good.<br />Hard To Explain - Fabulous rythym. Another one of my favorites. I love how it starts out somewhat slowly then speeds up then pauses then begins again with another verse.<br />When It Started - Great bass giutar in this song. Probably my least favorite song but I still love it to death.<br />Trying My Luck - I love this song. I really like the drums in this song and the words are special.<br />Take It Or Leave It - Wonderful guitar and the rythym is excellent. Julian Casablancas did a very good job on this vocally.<br />At the end of the last song I was left wanting more. This is my favorite CD and I would definitely reccommend it. So buy it and love it! Peace!
B008K6HN8I|4|Just a few more tweaks and this will be perfect.I prefer Astro with clear cut easy to follow actons but whatever.
B005723JSQ|5|I'm very pleased that the plot worked out with some predictability. It made the reading very satisfying. Can't wait to read more by this author.
B004UFEJS0|4|Very nice, like it.

B00IIU9U00|1|I couldn't watch more than five minutes of this filth.
B006Q2LTRO|1|A book to heal and fix marriage problems by tackling the roots of the problem and offering very practical solutions.
B003O86FMW|5|As I finished this second book of the trilogy, I am astonished at the way Suzanne Collins was able to write these books in such a manner that your attention is grabbed and builds to the very last page. Excellent and totally awesome.
B009GEFXLC|5|My son and I love this show. Another great season. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good crime show.
B00ILHW6AG|3|It's a page turner and a solid story. I was a bit disappointed with the ending. Duma Key and Full Dark, No Stars continue to be my favorites from SK from the past decade.
B00D7NWTSI|4|Good movie, got all 3. Thought the first 2 were better thou. Now to fill in my amazon required filler words, one two three four five six seven eight nine
B007VUA7VO|5|Its really trusty and is always at the right percentege.  Ive had the app for about eight months and it still works even with updates!
B004T4LUPW|5|I love this app, doubles as my day planner on my kindle fire. I can customize the font size and color of the background, as well as sync to my smartphone and google gmail account.
B00164GDD2|1|Seriously, the quality is awful.  The picture is grainy.  Really grainy.  Almost unwatchably grainy.  Unless you have a player that will allow you to soften the picture... a lot... then just buy the DVD.  And someone remind me to change my settings back to normal so other movies will still have outlines.
B00004XONN|5|First just let me say this CD is amazing for any of those that are wondering.  Next let me say don't expect anything like OK Computer, or any of their other CDs.  Just as OK Computer was much different from The Bends, Kid A is in a class of it's own.  Guitars are not a large part of this album as they were in the other three major albums.  This CD has a lot of organs, samples, and just weird ambeint noises--but with Radiohead, it sounds amazing.  <br />This CD is also different than the other three in that you can't just listen to one song at a time.  The CD needs to be listened to as a whole to completely enjoy it.  The first time I listened to it I was kind of taken a back, but now...mmm, I see it as nothing less than another Radiohead masterpiece.<br />Innovative and beautiful, this CD belongs in everyone's collection.
B00CV5ZPA2|2|Not Kanye's best album.  Just because it is a different type of sound, or music does not mean it is necessarily good!  Sorry Kanye!
0345803485|5|I'm not into the Smbd thing but loved this book. Couldn't put it down. A few laughs and a few tears.
B00DUGCLY4|4|This app is fun to play when bored.  Some emojis could be better, but overall it is good;)  fun and age appropriate too
B006LSZECO|4|Good fast paced , page turner holds you in suspense, would have never guessed such an ending...
B0020BUWX2|5|My teenager loved it.
B00915G6MG|5|Great set of characters and plots. Hooked on this show, sad to see Ziva leave the series. Hope they get someone half as good.
B000083E79|5|Excellent... (c:  Brings back the best memories and songs from long ago....  Great cd. Everyone needs to have this in their collection.

B004SKHJF2|4|helpful, helpful, is fantastic, you listen a song unknow and this app tells you the title, what do you want more?¿
B00L23RCPU|4|Obliviously, this is a great movie ! By the way , The Grand Budapest Hotel is charming, funny and unique.This has quickly jumped towards the top of some of my favorite Wes Anderson films! I love it!
B00EJOCB4G|5|good
0375842381|5|LOVED this trilogy. Couldn't put it down.  Finished all three books in a week and a half.
B003YL4LYI|5|Definitely not a book written to give warm, happy feelings however, very engaging.
B00CW6DAKC|4|I loved this game. Literally obsessed with it. But for some reason it won't let me on now. It keeps saying update to the latest version to continue farming. Then u click on it to open the appstore &amp; it's not even on there to update. It just says open. Then u click to open it and it goes right back to the update crap again. PLEASE fix this. I have stuff to collect:( If it weren't for thus I'd give it 10stars:)
B000002LSH|5|When I play this at dinner parties/poker tourneys/let's get together and hang out, etc., at least one person (and usually 2 or 3) asks me, \\"Who is this? I really like them!\\"
B00CSR2J9I|5|Simple to learn, but hard to master. Fun to upgrade vehicles, takes strategy and finese to reach REQUIRED DISTANCE. In top 3 favorite games on my kindle fire hd. Use the terrain to execute amazing stunts, which the game rewards you for. Menu, and UI (user interface), is elegant and stylish. This is  a must buy, satisfies any level of gamer. Well done, developers, can't wait for your next IP.
B008XG1X18|5|A great way to spend your free time.
0060194995|5|This book did not get the #1 book of all time from luck of the draw, the book deals with many issues that were very important in the time and has a plot that seems ordinary but you dont realize how much you loved the book  until you put it down, and find yourself wanting to run back to it to find  out what happens next, I LOVED THIS BOOK
B002XTXG1G|2|Disapointment
B009361C5O|5|a very nice app I am really enjoying it
B00NWDP6P6|5|It cleans just just just fine.
0307237699|1|Yes, he told us in advance what he planned to do. Few were listening.<br /><br />The following is a narrative taken from a 2008 Sunday morning televised \\"Meet The Press'.<br /><br />From Sunday's 07 Sept. 2008 11:48:04 EST, Televised \\"Meet the Press\\" THE THEN Senator Obama was asked about his stance on the American Flag.<br /><br />General Bill Ginn' USAF (ret.) asked Obama to explain WHY he doesn't follow protocol when the National Anthem is played.<br /><br />The General stated to Obama that according to the United States Code, Title 36, Chapter 10, Sec. 171...<br /><br />During rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed, all present (except those in uniform) are expected to stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. Or, at the very least, \\"Stand and Face It\\".<br /><br />NOW GET THIS !!<br /><br />'Senator' Obama replied:<br /><br />\\"As I've said about the flag pin, I don't want to be perceived as taking sides\\". \\"There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression..\\" \\"The anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all that sort of thing.\\"<br /><br />(ARE YOU READY FOR THIS???)<br /><br />Obama continued: \\"The National Anthem should be 'swapped' for something less parochial and less bellicose. I like the song 'I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing'. If that were our anthem, then, I might saluteit. In my opinion, we should consider reinventing our National Anthem as well as 'redesign' our Flag to better offer our enemies hope and love. It's my intention, if elected, to disarm America to the level of acceptance to our Middle East Brethren. If we, as a Nation of waring people, conduct ourselves like the nations of Islam, where peace prevails - - - perhaps astate or period of mutual accord could exist between our governments ...\\"<br /><br />When I become President, I will seek a pact of agreement to end hostilities between those who have been at war or in a state of enmity, and a freedom from disquieting oppressive thoughts. We as a Nation, have placed upon the nations of Islam, an unfair injusticewhich is WHY my wife disrespects the Flag and she and I have attended several flag burning ceremonies in the past\\".<br /><br />\\"Of course now, I have found myself about to become the President of the United States and I have put my hatred aside. I will use my power to bring CHANGE to this Nation, and offer the people a new path..My wife and I look forward to becoming our Country's First black Family. Indeed, CHANGE is about to overwhelm the United States of America \\"<br /><br />WHAAAAAAAT, the Hell is that???<br /><br />Yes, you read it right.<br /><br />I, for one, am speechless!!!<br /><br />AND YOU PEOPLE VOTED FOR THIS IDIOT? WAKE UP!!!!ts. We as a Nation, have placed upon the nations of Islam, an unfair injusticewhich is WHY my wife disrespects the Flag and she and I have attended several flag burning ceremonies in the past\\".     \\"Of course now, I have found myself about to become the President of the United States and I have put my hatred aside.

B00KA7JIII|5|The game is awesome but awfully short<br />Keeps you wanting for more<br />Each level is a piece of art
B00005PJ6M|5|Perfect! Just like described.
B005LL4U54|4|I loved the movie and the music is a great way to remember the movie and how wonderful it is.
B00C7607BC|4|I hadn't watched this movie in over a decade and it transported me back to when I was a little girl watching a magical princess movie. What a classic! I'm also really happy about the triple combo pack. I don't have a Blu-ray player, but I might some day. So for now I can watch the DVD or watch on my computer with the Digital Copy. I kinda wish that with all the hype there were more special features included in the diamond edition.
B0055D3EOG|4|Was good
B00AQ3K8IU|5|As a survivor myself I found this book to be warm emotionally written and right on in every aspect.  She captures all we learn in counseling and how to survive this devastating experience.
B00KY7PEAA|5|Fun
B008JAG2AA|4|I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was very funny.  Just a light romantic comedy.  Fun to watch it.
B00NH13W2W|5|Works great! Stylish and functional. Great product!
7500117124|2|Dr. Seuss is great - our kids and grandkids alike have loved his books. Fox in Socks may not be as popular as the Cat in the Hat, but they are in the same genre and excellent for beginning readers.<br />We ordered the book using a link supplied by our daughter to the Amazon website, and that link showed the book in English. However, when the book was received, it was a dual language book (English plus Chinese or some other Asian language that we neither read nor speak). i hope Amazon doesn't make mistakes like this very often!
B00170M2GW|3|Yes
6305126062|3|Thsi movie was okay, but that's about it.  It was SO long(almost three hours), and it has to be a pretty good movie to get away with that length, and the Horse Whisperer just wasn't there.  I love horses, and I love  romantic movies, but the plot just moved too slow for me and the ending  just isn't very conclusive.  They never tell us if Grace's mom and Tom  Booker end up together or if they decide to stay away from each other, and  that really bothered me.  Some people really loved this movie and I  understand how, but I just didn't like it that much.
B0009HLDFU|1|You arent getting one red cent from me, Foo Fighters! Anyway, I can listen to that god awful \\"best of you\\" song 20 times a day on local radio, which is enough free Foo for me.
B002UBRFDC|5|I had seen the mini series years ago and decided to read the book.  You learn a lot about history and Japanese culture.  Such a different view of life than most of us have today.  It would not have been complete without the tragic love story between two major characters.  I wish there had been a sequel.
B000FCKC4C|5|This book is a great book! A must read for everyone! I highly recommend it to anyone looking to feel better about their life's journey!
B002NZTZ8S|5|Great video with a wonderful message.
B00GOZQ2E8|4|Great game, but I'm having trouble connecting to Facebook. Otherwise, it is really fun, and I end up wasting plenty of time.
B0000931QA|5|All i can say about this masterpiece is out of the hundreds of cds I own, no one will ever top this disc.  I cannot even put into words my feelings about this disc.  EVERY song on this disc is nothing short of amazing. The story this disc contains is very powerful.  This is \\"Thinking Man's Music.\\" Definately not any of that mainstream crap on this disc.  I have never heard anything like it, awes me everytime I pop it in the player.  \\"Operation:Livecrime\\" is an amazing video to watch on my big screen, lights off, surround sound pumping melodies around me, sucking me into the screen.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND both cd and the dvd, I promise you won't be disappointed at all.  Buy this disc as soon as possible and let Queensryche awestruck you too.
B00CWY76CC|3|There are basically no instructions so it took a little bit to figure out what to do. Once I figured it out the game was really fun, then it ended after only 10 levels. I was able to play for about 20 minutes before I beat every level. Glad it was free.
0689859368|1|We got the beautiful collection trunk valued over $100. It's filled with a great variety of expensive paper treatments and gorgeous illustrations (although most of them are black/white). It's definitely impressive as a present until you start reading. So I'm assuming the largest portion of the price is comprised of the cost of the book production.<br />As much as my son (8 y/o) loves the subject-matter of this kind, every time we read, his attention begins to wonder every 2 minutes. The language used in the books is a way too dry and too complicated for kids, filled with pointless descriptions of insignificant things, while major scenes lack in-depth narration. So it seems you're reading a bunch of summaries that could have been linked to each other in a more engaging manner. BORING! We barely finished one chapter a day. Frankly, I was looking forward to the end of the story, so we could jump onto something more exciting than the Spiderwick Chronicles.<br />I'm surprised how many customers have left positive reviews for this  \\"Magic For Dummies.\\" The movie is so much better! Now that my son and I have finished reading, I see why the movie was modified so much - it was ADJUSTED into a consistent story that would be properly digested by the young audience.<br /><br />P.S. Bravo to the graphic designers, illustrator, and the book binding professionals! Great job designing such a visually appealing package for such a useless piece!
B0015DWJX2|5|This well-written story is developed around mostly warm and charming characters on the Island of Guernsey during WWII! I laughed and nearly cried with them. How the &#34;society&#34; came to be exemplifies the fears when the island was occupied by the Nazis. Shaffer and co-author Annie Barrows use a technique of letter writing mainly to and from Juliet, an author from London. Juliet is so taken with what she reads in the letters that she goes to Guernsey after the war and learns first-hand about their life on Guernsey during the war and its effects. I encourage others to read this and hope they will enjoy it as much as I have!
B00931JMRE|5|I am amazed how this group keeps going and performs their form of cool Texas rock. Even when there are similarities with their previous work, they keep me interested throughout this album.
B00AYB1RGG|4|Movie was far better than it was advertised. Lots of action could've had a better plot overall, has some nice little twists and turns and the ending is kind of cool.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book was phenomenal. There is nothing more I have to say besides it was a amazing book to read.
B00LXLM05I|4|Real good game
B005ZOBNOI|4|Worth reading.  The dialog is clever.  For a very sad story it doesn't really get too far over the edge.  Some parts of the story are a bit contrived.
B00LQEUE0K|5|The Who's new 2-CD retrospective entitled The Who Hits 50 is a MUST FOR ALL WHO FANS!<br />Many fans are complaining/p*ssing and moaning &#34;yet another collection&#34; but this time it's a Who compilation on 2 CDs and covers the band's history and then some on this 2-CD set.<br />Also this collection (like the 2002 2-CD Ultimate Collection), all of the tracks have their original mixes (and not the Jon Astley 1990s remixes which some griped at) and the tracks were all painstakingly REMASTERED from the original tapes..<br />The song selection represents the best of guitarist/songwriter Pete Townshend, lead singer Roger Daltrey and the late great bass player John Entwislte and the also sadly missed seemingly 4 armed and 4 legged drummer Keith Moon (five of the tracks feature his successor Kenney Jones and the final three current drummer Zak Starkey).<br />The group's first single as The High Numbers called &#34;Zoot Suit&#34; is included and is an excellent tune. Then we also have the two single A-sides &#34;I Can't Explain' and &#34;Anyway Anyhow Anywhere&#34; from 1965 are included and are still classics 50 years on.<br />The Who's debut album My Generation is represented by two tracks which were the classic title cut and the UK hit &#34;The Kids Are Alright&#34; (this time in its full album version).<br />The band's two 1966 monster hit singles &#34;Substitute&#34; (a UK Top 5) and &#34;I'm A Boy&#34; (one of the first songs to tackle on child abuse) are included proving why The Who were one of England's great singles bands in the 1960s although those 1965/66 initially tanked here Stateside.<br />The band's 1966/67 second effort A Quick One (titled Happy Jack in the US) is represented by The Ox's arguable classic &#34;Boris The Spider&#34; (this time in stereo) and &#34;Happy Jack&#34; (which was not on the original UK version of The Who's second album but became The Who's first Top 30 hit here in the States back in 1967 and is the original mono mix, not the fake stereo as on The Ultimate Collection).<br />Another 1967 single &#34;Pictures Of Lily&#34; is included here and is a classic rocker.<br />Then the group's 1967 effort The Who Sell Out is represented by the band's biggest US Top 10 hit &#34;I Can See For Miles&#34; which is still a great number today (although the song tanked in the band's native Europe).<br />We also have the rare 1968 single &#34;Dogs&#34; which is in its original mix and an excellent version!<br />Two songs from the 1968 US only release Magic Bus are represented by &#34;Call Me Lightning&#34; and its US hit title cut (here in the full long version previously found only on the Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy compilation).<br />The group's first US Top 5 album, the rock opera Tommy, is represented by the classics &#34;Pinball Wizard&#34; (the album's biggest hit), &#34;I'm Free&#34; and the finale to &#34;We're Not Gonna Take It&#34; called &#34;See Me Feel Me&#34; (which was another US hit).<br />The group's 1970 single &#34;The Seeker&#34; is also included and is a great rocker.<br />The classic live effort Live at Leeds (another US Top 5 effort from 1970) is represented by &#34;Summertime Blues&#34; (the band's classic rendition of the Eddie Cochran classic which they made their own).<br />Then over half of the band's best selling album, 1971's Who's Next (which reached #4 on the US charts) is represented by the rocking ode to Meher Baba and avant garde musician Terry Riley called &#34;Baba O'Riley&#34; (which was mistitled Teenage Wasteland but is a classic and features Dave Arbus on violin), the rocker &#34;Bargain&#34; (which ends disc one and got a new lease on life when used in a Nissan commercial in 2002), the US rock radio smash about vengeance called &#34;Behind Blue Eyes&#34; (which kicks off the second disc of this best of and this great track was unfortunately defacated by Limp Bizkit in 2003) and the single edit of The Who's US Top 20 smash &#34;Won't Get Fooled Again&#34; (which is stilla classic today).<br />The first of three Who's Next outtakes &#34;Let's See Action (Nothing Is Everything)&#34; is also on this set as is the US Top 20 single from 1972 &#34;Join Together&#34; and was another Who's Next leftover and is a classic. Then we also have &#34;The Relay&#34; which has not been on a Who compilation in years.<br />The 1973 rock opera Quadrophenia (which reached #2 in the US) is represented by the classic &#34;5:15&#34; (a hit single from the album) and the classic finale &#34;Love Reign O'er Me&#34; (which was released as a single here in the US but flopped yet became a US rock radio staple and is one of The Who's best songs).<br />1974's rarities collection Odds and Sods is represented by the John Entwistle penned rocker &#34;Postcard&#34; which is a great song from The Ox and was a US only single.<br />1975's The Who by Numbers (which peaked at #8 here Stateside) is represented by the Top 20 smash hit &#34;Squeeze Box&#34; which is the only rock song I know that had a banjo solo and still kicked *ss. The other rock radio hit &#34;Slip Kid&#34; is also included.<br />1978's swan song with the band's classic lineup before the death of drummer Keith Moon, the #2 charting Who Are You album is represented by the classic Top 20 title cut in its single mix (with f words intact) and the John Entwistle rocker called &#34;Trick Of the Light&#34;.<br />The Who's 1981 album Face Dances which reached #4 here in the US (kept out by fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Steve Winwood's Arc Of a Diver at #3, REO Speedwagon's Hi Infidelity at #2 and Styx's classic Paradise Theatre was #1 here in the States whilst Adam Ant's Kings of the Wild Frontier was #1 in the UK) and was their first album with former Small Faces/Faces drummer Kenney Jones replacing Keith Moon and represented by the first song to ever top Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart called &#34;You Better You Bet&#34; (which was a great rocker which hit #18 on the Billboard Hot 100) and that album's second single &#34;Don't Let Go the Coat&#34;.<br />The 1982 swan song with John Entwistle It's Hard (which peaked at #9 in the US) is represented by the rock radio hits &#34;Athena&#34; (which hit the US Top 30), &#34;Eminence Front&#34; which was one of Pete Townshend's best tracks and its title cut.<br />The 2004 compilation Here and Now is represented by &#34;Real Good Looking Boy&#34; which featured Greg Lake of Emerson Lake and Palmer on bass guitar filling in for the sadly missed John Entwistle (who passed away in 2002).<br />2006's comeback Endless Wire is represented by &#34;It's Not Enough&#34;.<br />Finally we end with the new rocker &#34;Be Lucky&#34; which proves Roger and Pete still have it whilst The Rolling Stones sound tired and lifeless now!<br />If you want a great start place with The Who, this new 2-CD best of (which also has a nice essay by Howie Edelson) is RECOMMENDED!!!a classic today).<br />The first of three Who's Next outtakes &#34;Let's See Action (Nothing Is Everything)&#34; is also on this set as is the US Top 20 single from 1972 &#34;Join Together&#34; and was another Who's Next leftover and is a classic.

B00571F26Y|5|I have read innumerable &#34;diet&#34; books over the years only to realize they are really all pretty much the same. Sure, they add their own little twist, but basically it is the same information being rehashed over and over and over again.<br /><br />Enter Wheat Belly. When I started reading, I was probably a bit jaded, figuring it would be more of the same. Before I finished the first chapter, I knew I was wrong. Wheat Belly actually imparts eye-opening information in a non-preachy, interesting, humorous way. It made me realize that, even if I didn't need to lose some weight, this is how I should be eating. Heck, this is how EVERYONE should be eating.<br /><br />America is the fattest, sickest nation on the planet. I honestly believe Wheat Belly could reverse that trend if people just knew the truth, if our government and doctors just knew the truth. The truth IS contained in this book and I would encourage every single person to not only read it, but put it into practice.

B000JK8OYU|4|If you are a Beatles fan and don't already have a difinitive collection, here ya go. The Beatles were some of the greatest songwriters to have ever lived. If you are looking for something new, check out The Everybodyfields. They have some amazing harmonies (would remind you of some of the greats) and a old school sound.
B00DPM7TIG|5|I read this book twice, and got even so much more the second time. It is about everything, -----life, death, love , war, light, darkness.  It is an eloquent and profound book.<br />I'd recommend this book to everyone~

B0000VAFNQ|5|Together with Underworld: Evolution, two great films. Action-packed, fast paced, great photograhpy and special effects; good plot too. A must see for action/vampire film lovers. This the first film to see. Then see Underworld: Evolution, to keep the story straight. Buy it!
