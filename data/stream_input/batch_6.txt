B009FU6WTO|5|It's worth every penny.  Don't waste your time and money with oe or other replacements
B00BCRMAAS|2|I didn't expect much at this price but it was less than I had hoped for.  The seat part for the front seats didn't even come close to fitting and did not consider seat belts that come out from the seat, or side adjustment levers.  Material is VERY thin so when you try to stretch it make sure you pull at the seams, which are somewhat reinforced, lest the material tear.  I didn't even bother trying to install the rear seat covers.  What did I think of this product?  Let's just say that I will be going to an auto store to find something else!
B00MIJNFV2|5|Fit great, and fits better than the stock filter. I don't know if it's a jeep grand Cherokee ecodiesel thing, but check your filters. Ours was cracking with less than 2K miles on it. Shipped fast to Alaska too!
B00A8OQMA0|3|What they don't mention anywhere I could find is that you must use an on-demand valve (Attwood makes one) or else the pressure in this tank will push gas out the tube every time it heats up from the sun.  Eventually this will actually empty the tank.  The cap that comes on this tank now has an EPA mandated one way valve.  It will let air in when the motor is running but will not allow fumes to escape when the tank is just sitting; so when heated by the sun the tank swells up like a balloon (It's supposed to)  and pushes gas out the hose to the engine, where it leaks past the carb and into the air or water.  Some people have had problems with engine flooding from the increased pressure.  So you MUST install an ON-DEMAND valve.  (It goes between the tank and the squeeze bulb).  And don't forget the new EPA hose has a liner; be careful not to get it caught in the valve when splicing it in.  (BTW: ethanol seems to eat these new liners, at least the few I've seen).  I run non-ethanol gas.<br /><br />The fuel gauge is mickey mouse; if your boat moves much it just bounces around.  The boat must be rock steady still for a minute or so for this gauge to read anywhere near correctly.  I don't rely on it; I release pressure on the tank (one click open) and then remove the cap and look for myself.  Just consider this tank as ALWAYS under pressure.<br /><br />Once the tank swells up it stays ballooned out, only going back down a very little bit.  So it's supposed to look like a watermelon.  The concern I have is how long will this tank last.  Seems like a lot of stress for a little plastic tank.  I wonder how long it can go before something like a seam splits out?  I'll see, I guess.  Just hope it happens at the dock if it does happen.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />Waddie
B009PA1GX6|5|Ok
B00Y5LCSXC|2|Appears good quality, just doesn't fit my car which it was advertised for.
B00J62RBUA|5|Fit perfectly on my Tundra 2014 Crew Max. Good size and looks epic. Delivery was good too. Good packaging.
B00062ZHTG|5|Nice chrome, perfect leak free fit.
B0050LU2GQ|5|Love these!!! Easy up, easy down, no fumbling with flimsy hook on difficult mirror. Worth every penny.
B00JBI9G7K|5|Just as described. Great looking lamps. Truly does add flair to the vehicle. Thank you
B006T08WXM|5|These are genuine Mopar oil filters for SRT motors.  They are factory OEM SRT filters - same as what you would have factory on a SRT car...these can also be used on non SRT vehicles.  I have a 2015 Dodge Challenger Scat Pack, it's an R/T with the 6.4 SRT motor and I use these filters over the standard dodge/mopar one that come on the car.
B001TFE38A|4|easy to apply and easy to remove. The car is super bright. Expect rain and over time to see if it works.  the results:
B00M9MHH08|5|Good solid grips, I used spray can upholstery glue to secure them right to my bars, fit great on 7/8&#34; OD bars, a lot more grip for my street bike controls will buy again when they wear down
B00H36XXBW|5|This is a neat solar panel. It is very versatile and tough. The accessories that come with this panel are for connecting it to charge 12 volt batteries. I also have the XGrid XGS9USB 9w solar panel which has a 5 volt regulator for charging smart phones. . The 2 panels are chainable and together provide 18 watts of solar power. The voltage output of all NOCO panels is 12 volts unlike the 5 volt output of most panels. There are a wide variety of accessories available for this system. The panels are compact and fits easily in a small backpack. The Velcro closure system is much better than the magnets found on some panels. This panel also has 2 roomy net pockets, unlike other panels that only have one small pocket. I've used lots of this type panel and most are flimsy and bow when used for 4 or 5 hours in the sun, not this one. It is sturdy and very well made. The Velcro tabs that are used for securing it closed also double as connectors when daisy chaining the panels. In all this panel can be connected to 12 other panels. I have also invested in 2 of the rugged portable battery packs that NOCO makes, the XGB6 a 6000mah, and the XGB3L a 3300mah battery pack with flashlight. There is a 4 watt version of this panel which I do not recommend as it is too small to be very effective. If you are looking for a system that has unlimited possibilities, that is expandable and very durable this is the one.
B001FEOQZA|5|These work great with a lifted truck.
B00MG687JW|5|It is amazing. It gives me a piece of mind that I can use it to jump start a car without any risk. It is able to jump a car more than 10 times. Way more than just a power packing jump for automobiles.
B008427D88|5|Just like OEM. Not chinsy at all
B00077UAHO|5|This fit our 2009 Mercury Mariner Premier perfectly.  Light weight...  thin...  but sturdy.  We haul 4-6 gas cans to the city for gas for the farm.  No worries about spillage.  And the textured surface keeps thing in place.
B005OKVGG8|5|The car seat I purchased from  Amazon works fine and corrects an automobile  manufacturer's error of design
B00A6AS6LY|5|After doing much research we have found this product to be the best product value and fast shipping was even better, thank you...
B001810SHA|5|works great fast shipping
B00DL1ZOMY|5|Small but very efficient for what I needed it for , love the different light settings and it being a sealed unit.the only dowe fall the cord could have been straight instead of being  coiled, besides that I recommend this product to anyone who needs one.
B00AZ67XPY|5|Lowering springs are great. It arrived 2 dayday's earlier then expected. The car rides great. Here's a before and after pictures..
B00D1SX8JI|5|Looking to repurchase them because I just loved them so much on my Nissan Sentra. The asking price is definitely a but much because it is not &#34;high quality&#34;. With that being said, it is by far the best jaguar print I've found yet. The color and print will not make your interior look cheap or tacky compared to others I've seen. Very chic, subtle, and cute. It's tough to install, thank goodness for my husband who had the patience. The seat covers looked so good that I had a few people ask if I had my car seats &#34;custom&#34; made.
B000CF5ZF8|5|Fast Shipping.  Part as advertised.
B00JIIZCM6|3|I've never cleaned leather before, so, not sure what to think. I tried this product on a white leather handbag . What I thought was a stain could have been the leather missing. I'll have to try it on a different color before I can comment on its reliability.
B00B5LMAVA|5|After seeing positive reviews I got sold and ordered mine right away ! Installation was simple just takes time and patience (took me about an hour for each) and right away before you know it you got yourself a different look for your camaros seats ! I ordered mine to protect my current leather seats from cracking and what not from the heat . These do the job to protect them 👍🏼. And are very comfy :). Would recommend.
B009W364KQ|5|Fit and looked great
B00KV8U254|3|yellow yellow yellow! totally yellow light.<br />The package misleads customers to think the light is white or blue.<br />Believing products details &#34;color temperature&#34; is better way to choice headlights,<br />and this product don't even marked color temperature.<br />otherwise, it works well. Just notice that don't touch glass part.<br />Oil and high temperature might damage bulbs.
B0063I3KAA|5|Fits as expected. Thanks
B008032QSI|5|This finally took care of my fuel leaking issue when I would fill my gas tank all the way. It wasn't the easiest to get to, but actually installing it was a breeze. One hose clamp on the fuel tank and three screws at the fender and that is it. Search YouTube for good videos on how to lift the bed off instead of attempting to do this with the bed in place. It was much easier and I didn't have to disturb my old rusted fuel tank straps.
B007JSGR9Y|4|works as expected om my Subaru but not my other cars.
B000BWAITA|5|Everything was perfect thanks
B00199BWTE|5|awesome product and very fast shipping thanks
B0029XERRS|5|Great quality has held up for the past 6 months flawlessly

B001GS1PMM|5|My husband loves this on his bike
B00LC82GZQ|5|Worked great for 1998 Saturn SC2! very easy to program from the top row on the OBD2 port just jump pin 4 and 8 with a paper clip and the key in the ignition but not turned. the horn will beep once. hold both LOCK AND UNLOCK at the same time. car will beep. remove paper clip. remote is programmed!
B006OKXKA2|4|Cheap and easy way to help your engine breath, however, don't expect your vehicle to run any better. I found no noticeable improvements other than piece of mind.
B007RRTK14|4|Good for touch ups
B00OCEGONC|4|Was exactly what I expected and arrived quickly
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Simply bright and a huge money saver

B00NQM480C|5|I lined my steering wheel and it looks awesome.
B001RZC1AE|5|Product was as described, recommended.
B00JR3XTOA|5|Awesome hint of blue for my car
B0049IZ3J2|2|cannot get a mobility cart on it ramp to step and it drags bottom has to be lifted up on it
B00EPFO9N0|5|The tools included in this kit were perfect for replacing the motors.  For someone who never did any soldering before, it was pretty easy taking out the old ones and putting in the new ones.  All four of them work perfectly and I saved a ton of money by doing it myself!!!!
B007NA9CAE|3|Please look at the add carefully and tell me if you can find where it states only a single step ships for the price. The picture shows two, in the title they use the word steps. Other than add being misleading the product is pretty good.
B004GC2D08|1|advertising shows chrome finish, actual product is in primer therefore unusable. must now try to straighten my existing one
B00YEWFNFW|5|The kits I ordered arrived right on time. I used the mitts on the outside and then used one on the inside for windows,seats and dash.They fit my hand and very easy for a women to use. I am going to try one set for around the house as well,windows woodwork cabinets etc.
B000M8PZGE|5|This grease is essential if you are doing your own brake jobs.  I track my BMW M3, and the grease holds up to the temperature.  I highly recommend.
B004X973EA|5|Really quieted down my Harley
B00N9LMXUC|5|nice shade
B003U53JYG|5|As soon as this arrived, I used it! Omg! Amazing stuff! I have someone that comes and details my SUV, and he recommended I get this, what a great product. Will recommend to everyone I know.
B002UC6VNQ|4|get's rid of lake scum with minimal elbow grease. Watch out for inhaling the fumes.
B00R1LP17S|5|Outstanding pump.  Very well made and quieter than I expected.  Pumps fast.
B007JG1W1E|5|This does a wonderful job keeping the grey tank smelling good (like lemons) and clog free.  Highly recommended.
B00BMUBPHO|5|just as expected
B00IPS4APU|5|supper
B007B83T98|4|I have only used one of these so far and it works as expected. I did take off 1 star because the LED is practically useless in the day time. I can not see it unless it is dark outside.
B001DRLPIK|5|great one i like it
B012YMDPHG|5|Love this item I have been wanting one for a while and this came along great deal.
B0002F68JK|5|I purchased this windshield cover for my 2005 F350 BT Cruiser and it fits like a glove! It also came with an equally nice storage bag that takes up little space in my 'home away from home'. The cutout straps for the mirrors fit snugly and add to the overall security and total privacy. I highly recommend this product.
B00BCRM9RM|3|Not too bad for the price. One of the seat covers had a small hole
B00M78820I|5|“ It works great. ”
B009POP5TS|2|Pen was cool. Heavy and the ink was horrible.
B00RK7FTTI|2|The photo makes it look like you are getting more than one silicone key fob -- you are not!  I didn't have a chance to choose a color either.  I think the photo misrepresents what is actually received.  The silicone fob itself is nice, and works on my remote.  Just wish that the photo hadn't misrepresented what I was actually getting.
B002NAOIUI|5|Fits perfect.  Just like OEM
B0076DU4GE|5|Super easy to install and keeps all the off road dust out of the cabin.
B000CEP1V2|5|Perfect
B009DPP6QQ|5|I put this in my f150 5.0, I am VERY happy with this tuner! It is easy to hook up, easy to use, Love how it looks with the Ford dash and gauge cluster. All round awesome Tuner and well worth the money!! If I ever had to buy another tuner i would buy the SCT in a heart beet!
B008YVOLH0|5|fits in my fj cruiser as expected, highly recommended .
B004JBI6C0|5|Perfect fit
B000CNN27S|5|Absolutely love it!!! Had it put on for around $60, which included an extension and welding. Awesome, aggressive sound that makes my truck sound like it should...
B00RSOLXFM|5|I was skeptical at first after testing some other brands a few years ago, but this really works. Just give it a couple of days to get all the nasty odors down on the floor.
B005K97RRA|5|Speedy shipping. Good product.
B001RMT90W|4|All good, no issues and installed easily. Shipping took was a little slow, but not a show stopper.
B00O9APDNG|5|A++++
B007J78IRE|5|Love Flamingos and this one is really cute and funny. I'll get it on my van as soon as I find the ideal location!
B00EDWF1BE|4|These latches are well made and designed to provide a more robust latching system without the &#34;rubber band&#34; and plastic of the original Jeep part.  I installed this item and it works well on my 2015 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Hard Rock with the Hard Rock/10th Anniversary Hood.  I purchased the smooth black finish which looks good and hopefully will fade much slower than the original black plastic.<br /><br />The instructions could be better written.  They don't say how to get to the back of the bottom part of the latch that's on the fender.  I removed the top connectors on my front grill to get to the nuts on the backside of this piece.  Even then, the nut is very hard to get to.  I used a very small 1/4&#34; socket driver with a hinged head.  For the price of this kit, it should come with a special tool to help reach the nuts in this area.  Also, the kit comes with washers but they aren't listed as contents on the instructions page or shown on any step of the instructions.  Rugged Ridge customer support said the washers go under the mounting nuts.  The instructions should be updated to show this.<br /><br />Each latch has a threaded rod that is completely adjustable to reach your desired hood tension/compression.  The directions say, &#34;When adjusted properly, hood should contact and slightly compress the hood bumper.&#34;  This is not very specific, but the threaded rods do allow you to set any compression you desire.<br /><br />Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase and look forward to a durable product that should last as long as the Jeep.
B0018DHBUK|4|Exactly matches the look of the stock mirror with the benifit of being able to adjust the blind spot mirror too.  The mirror glass does shake more than the stock one, but it still serves it purpose.
B000C5I74E|5|A great deal for large size Chevy or GMC Trucks 1996 through 1999's
B0012WHBSO|5|perfect size and the quality was excellent
B00029JHJ4|5|This is for Holley 2300 2 barrel carb. Picture and description is wrong. I took a chance & ordered it, glad I did, best price out there.
B001RB61LS|5|All I can say is COOL for this NICE without the sticky mess of adhesive.
B001DBTUYW|5|Application: 2006 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab 3.7L V6.  Extremely well maintained low mileage truck purchased at a heavy discount back in March 2015. I started noticing the typical sickly sweet smell of a coolant leak sometime in April, then observed coolant dripping from the lower heater ports and firewall discharge tube. Since we were starting our South Alabama summer, I simply bypassed the core and waited until the temperatures started dropping.<br /><br />Just a tip: Use your phone to take plenty of pictures before starting and during disassembly. This will show routing of cables, bolt types, location, etc. and a heck of a lot faster than taking notes.<br /><br />I started the project Friday August 28, 2015 around 2:30 PM CST.  The service manual and a majority of folks state to remove the front seats. While this will certainly provide additional access, it is not a requirement.  Disconnect battery before doing anything. Carefully begin removing the dash upper trim, and LH/RH trim panels and the LH/RH hand grip trim pieces, glove box and lower console trim (depending on your model and trim level), and knee panel. Remove 4 washer-nuts allowing steering column to lay down (no need to remove). Then remove the variety of bolts holding the dash module in place. Once loose, roll back from the passenger side. I secured the dash to the headrest tubes using straps, and this gave plenty of room to access the air box.<br /><br />Most folks will tell you that in order to &#34;do it right&#34;, then you MUST go through the process of discharging the AC, replacing the condenser, accumulator and all that jazz, then have the unit recharged.  Keep in mind, the service manual is written for dealerships and mechanics who are on the clock, therefore it must be &#34;the right way&#34;...  I'll offer up my 30 years of experience in the automotive supply chain as an Engineering & Quality Manager to tell you that the &#34;right&#34; way is often due to built in design limitations. This is one of those times where accessibility was an afterthought.<br /><br />If you're careful, and willing to spend an extra 30 minutes, you can do this job without discharging the AC and replacing all of the related components. This is strictly a decisions that must be made by the owner based on mileage, years, and condition of the system. In my case, this truck is well below 100K miles. A well maintained AC system will last twice and sometimes three times that, so I opted not to open up the system, but again, that choice is yours.<br /><br />Go under the hood, remove the coolant lines, get the ECM/TCM out of the way & access the airbox retaining bolts. Loosen the bolts on the AC accumulator but do not remove the clamps. All of this will allow you to pull the airbox into the cab & away from the firewall about 4 to 5 inches. Then remove the perimeter screws and lift off the upper airbox. The heater core comes with it. Now you can gently lift up on the AC condenser coil and roll the lower airbox out. Once out, spray it down with detergent and hose out the old coolant (or you'll smell it forever). I soaked down the AC condenser with a mild detergent and used the shop vac to clean out dust and any mold growth.<br /><br />This is a good time to check the air inlet port to clean out accumulated debris and/or ensure no rats have taken up residence.<br /><br />Most of the foam gaskets around mating surfaces have turned to dust, and will eventually blow into your cab, so I took extra time to completely remove and replaced with new weatherstrip. My OCD cleaning and new seals added to the reassembly time, but I just can't help myself.<br /><br />Install the new heater core, reassemble the airbox, (yes, every screw), reinstall to the firewall, then reassemble everything.<br /><br />Taking my time, the job was complete around 11:30PM CST for about 9 hours.  If I had to do it again, knowing the connection points and such, I could likely shave 3 to 4 hours off of the job.<br /><br />As anticipated, the AC still works perfectly, and we have a working heater, all without having to discharge/recharge the AC system.<br /><br />Feel free to comment/message if you need any assistance. I hope this helps!s anticipated, the AC still works perfectly, and we have a working heater, all without having to discharge/recharge the AC system.<br /><br />Feel free to comment/message if you need any assistance. I hope this helps!

B00IXT161W|5|Paint came out perfect..the description was written on point and this is a brand i would buy from again!
B00VKVFUO4|5|Fun way to put a little personalization on your vehicle.
B001C4SL3G|2|Paid premium for this filter in hopes of increasing gas mileage or performance and did not notice any differences.  My MPG stats were actually slightly lower after installation.
B00TXAWAEC|5|fits great on our Sportsman 850. will see how string they are here real soon.
B000C3XD90|5|Seems to work as designed and is easy to get on and off.
B0046ID5EK|1|Has to be reset frequently! Why?
B000WJJ1HC|4|Wear gloves while using this lube and don't get it on your hands.  It's really sticky and won't come off your hands easily.  My can had a loose spray nozzle and I got a bunch of it on my hands.
B0055BXW3Q|5|Higher quality than most heat barriers on the market, easy install, quality adhesive and much better than OEM.
B00NLMEVQI|1|Don't waste your money!!! Bought this as a gift for my mother because it states it's made of &#34;5 layers&#34; for maximum protection -- bought it in January and it was worn away and ripping in less than 6 months!!! This cover did nothing that it claims to do! It's so worn out after just a few months of use, so worn that you can see the car through it!! How is that &#34;protective&#34;?!?!? I contacted the company a few months back regarding this horrible made/defective product for a refund or for a new cover that will actually do what it claims to do but have not heard back from them.<br />Here is what it claims: It's B.S. If you are ok with giving away $40-$50 to this company for a product that is poorly made, then buy this cover. WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!! AND I FEEL TERRIBLE BECAUSE THIS WAS A GIFT!!<br />&#34;Your Indoor or outdoor car-cover will need to do more than just cover your vehicle. Our car cover fabric employs BDKUSA superior process. The result is our 5 layers car cover delivers maximum protection as compared to competing 8 layers from other brands. Our car cover provides you 1. All weatherproof 2. Superior dry time 3. Breathable 4. UV resistant 5. Dust-proof 6. Scratch-less 7. Durable 8. Easy care 8. Soft Touch 9. Extra ding protection&#34;
B007QBY0GQ|5|Thanks
B00CQCKIWU|5|Fits perfectly simple instructions can be found on the ft86 forum
B007V6JZ66|2|To cheaply made. plastic.
B00MO9HJM2|1|Didn't fit my Tahoe after all.
B007ZLNCJI|5|Works fine so far.  fraction of dealer cost.
B008PJDOSS|5|Looks well made. Easy to install. Air smells very fresh.
B008ALOA1G|4|The carseat covers fit great in my Ford Fusion. They are made a little thin but I just wanted something covering my car seats from all the fade they had. Easy to install, takes about 1/2 hour
B00E8HGCEY|1|Arrived right on Prime Time - Have a Craftsman Floor Foot Pump Jack I use most of the time, stash it under a work bench and takes 2 peeps since I have to ride the Scoot up on a 2x4 for clearance. Reviews were mostly good on this scissor jack, price was reasonable. I know the perfect CG on my CVO Harley FXR3 - 700 lbs tops. No matter whether it was slightly F or R heavy by making slight adjustments, the scissor was always uneven aft by 2 or 3 inches at half height. Do NOT trust it! I do love Prime - sent it back!  Keep Looking .........
B007EZ0EZK|5|OEM Oil filter and o-ring.  Perfect fit.
B00WS25ZCG|4|works grate
B0050VGZLM|5|Best device I have tried.  Having 6 kids the remote and phone gets lost easily. With this device the ease of finding these things are 10 easier.
B000IYR6V4|4|great
B0009IQZPW|5|These applicator pads make applying wax very easy. Yes there are cheaper ways to do it but for my time and money, I wouldn't use anything else.
B000C9I8M6|5|Cheaper than I found at dealer works great
B00H7QZSOS|5|I had to bend the product because it got bent at some point in the delivery process.  It works great and added color to my keys.
B000ZRW78Q|5|Awesome product! Super easy 2 hook up. At has unbelievable range. I used it for a 24&#34; lightbar in the lower grill of a 08 pilot!
B003177BYW|1|Does NOT fit 2004 WR450F
B006ZZTCDU|4|Shipped on time. The stands are good. The only problem is that the rear stand did not easily fit my 2000 GSXR, although the description says it fits all GSXRs. I had to manually push the forks out a little bit.
B004990YTA|4|as expected
B00IQFDCSI|4|It was perfect besides the missing bolt to install it
B00CU773JM|5|Ideal for my raptor 700.<br />It is an excellent product which is suitable for this type of ATV that does not have a factory odometer.<br />I actually decided to buy another one for my banshee 350.
B00FR2JF0W|1|Save your money! This is very flimsy and I doubt it will last more than a couple months. I also believe it may have drained my battery due to a  USB circuiut problem. My battery has never died until after I installed this. I had nothing plugged into it either and the battery still died.
B000IZ03YA|5|Great for my 2006 Galant
B0012PQBVE|5|Works as it is suppose to.
B0002SQYTG|5|This is an accurate gauge that has a nice amount of weight.  You dont feel like you are holding cheap import garbage with Milton!
B00E0OR5AA|5|Great sticker -shipped in time for the FOURTH. Thanks ! ! !
B00FC22HUM|5|Fit my 2002 Chevy Monte Carlo SS perfectly. Great color and both worked without any issues. Great kit and I'm sure to do business with Innovited again in the future
B00BTLEIIY|3|They fit really well bit the back covers are a bit tricky to install even after you watch the slick instructional video.  The elastic on the back pockets have come loose without much handling and the stitching on bottom part of the drivers side seat is starting to come undone.  Not sure that I would recommend it.
B007XWTVWG|5|My buddy needed a cheap exhaust for his 91 accord. Something that was cheaper than oem and wouldn't be a coin toss like a junkyard oem exhaust. This exhaust sounds surprisingly good and was fairly easy to install. The sound is nice and deep and not too ricey. With the silencer this exhaust is only slightly louder than stock.
B00MHI6P5M|5|Easy to install.
B000C01XWM|5|After ordering two other master cylinders from somewhere else, this was finally the right one for my BMW E36. The issue was with the port sizes. The oem part has two different port sizes just like this Centric Parts. While other brands said their master cylinder said it would fit my car, their port sizes were both the same size, which obviously didn't work out.
B00IO95ILU|4|Rotors and pads installed and work very well.<br />Slight whirring noise likely due to the slot/drill pattern but stops straight and true. Definitely an improvement over the stock rotors.
B000EDUTNQ|5|just as described and good price
B004W4OPQK|3|I love the way these Headlight looks but I'm having problem adjusting the bulb. I was also sent two sets of Headlights and I only need one! A good thing that I was sent two sets because one of the sets had a bulb that did not work. When I tried to have it replaced I was told that I was over the 30 day limit to have it replace or returned. Now I'm stuck with Headlights that I can't sell. Can you explain to me how I can replace one of the five small bulbs on the top of the Headlights.
B0087NAWYQ|5|Great sound. Many useful and easy to access functions. Can listen to music, answer calls, talk to other riders. Still comfortable and non-intrusive. Had them for three years- still going strong.
B00KPWBBLA|5|They were easy to install and look great!
B00WFHWWRU|5|Work's great
B0002SRH5G|5|Works great.
B001AJH1HK|5|They fit the mirrors of our truck and make seeing what is near the end of the trailer possible.
B00KTIYXLU|5|I have read all the reviews and for the ones who are complaining I can't help but imagine you may have received a defect by accident. I lost my keys and alarm last week and called the dealership for quote on replacement for the alarm and key. They told me $215.00 which I said was insane lol. So went to local locksmith and got a spare key for $50.00 (Which Included programming the key) I looked on Amazon for replacement alarm and saw this deal for 2 of them for only 9 bucks. I just followed directions and which was real simple in less than 2 minutes I synced both alarms they work better than the previous alarms great range well over 30 feet locks and trunk pop open just perfect no complaints at all. I would highly recommend this product and seller as well. This product save me well over $100.00 bucks
B001RMT90W|5|Fits perfectly makes car look brand new

B0042KL7OM|1|Don't waste your money bay Rupes LHR75E
B000C16XCG|5|Haven't put it in yet but I already know this is a good one. They run smooth and work perfect. And they come with short and long 10mm nuts and bolts so that's always a plus. Thanks Dorman.
B00QY1XY84|5|Great craftsmanship! This item is exactly as described. The keychain has some weight to it so you know it's not made of cheap metal. It goes perfectly with my husbands wallet.
B00K7X870U|5|they fitted perfectly on my saab 9-3 2003, the grip feels very good, and the design details look well made. They do lokk dirty quick but they're very easy to clean 👍🏼
B010DDN1O0|5|Worked as intended

B00F5MU9MW|5|Great shower for rv
B00PZUM9XQ|5|Great price for both items, did not take long to get. I work on atv's & would purchase again!
B005M4GC74|3|The size fits my car. But no clips, it is weird. I did a little bit more works. Take 3M double tape out, using epoxy plastic glue to solid it onto my car. Look fine. Anyway,17$, what do you expect.....
B000KL3DLC|5|Perfect fit
B00MDUY0VK|5|Just what I wanted. Will be ordering a couple more soon.
B00QM8B6E8|3|For the same price found on Amazon, I find this floormat in stock at Pep Boys in a complete set of four.  The online product description implies that this is just one floormat.  It should be more clearly stated.  $25 for one floormat is not a favorable price.
B000HLU8IG|5|Comes with hardware for install, lined it up, drilled 4 holes and installed, probably took a good half-hour as needs to be correctly placed.
B001PYHCGA|5|Fits perfectly in honda accord 90-93 passenger side
B0002SRCK6|4|great product
B007V2DMQO|5|Good item as advertised
B00PV5F7NO|5|Rolls up to a small tube when you want you want to put the back seats up. Keeps the floor of the van clean. The only drawback is it was too short for my Sedona.
B003SG431U|5|I can't really say anything bad about these. I mean it looks stylish and it just brings some color and pizzazz to my 1997 Nissan Sentra. I would suggest these for those who want to bring some style to their car.
B00HZB93BO|4|As expected
B00554PR6I|4|Nothing wrong with this harness,seems like quality construction. However it did not work for my 2013 Chrysler Town & Country. When I contacted Kensun customer service, they said I needed a different harness with resistors to fool the on board computer to think regular 55Watt bulbs are installed. I was getting flickering which was annoying to me and probably more so to other drivers.
B005C587EE|5|good
B00GVHQTN8|5|Great product, fit just like it was suppose to and looks great
B000JWI8C6|3|Works well but took me like 2 hours to install the thing, I should of brought a rubber hammer to help position the receiver in place. Unfortunately I lowered my exhaust like the instructions said but it still touches the tow receiver and makes a terrible sound when starting the car up and driving along the road. Can't seem to lower the exhaust anymore so I'm stuck with the rattling.
B004HM0HKA|4|ther work well
B002IG1WJC|5|Perfect in every way. Was not expecting the pair...what a bonus.  Very simple to replace , took 10 minutes.
B005DCKRP8|5|It was in perfect condition.  It looks fabulous on my car

B001KO6NTM|5|Perfect fit for my FJ1200.
B0046YMYH8|5|installed to the license plate bracket on my motorcycle, adds a nice amount of light to help with visibility.  easy to install, spliced into existing wiring.
B012YMDPHG|5|great item i bought cause it wasn't that expensive soon as i got it check my car obviously luckily nothing was wrong but really a cool thing to have will come in handy for sure in the future very easy to deal with the seller they were fast and very responsive item arrived on time and is exactly what i  expected so far amazon has been really good to me
B00QKLFFWG|5|I purchased a UHaul Hitch for my previous Highlander which worked well, but developed rust on all the weld points. This hitch feels just as sturdy and has a nice protective coating on it, so I'm confident it will hold up.
B0068C11XO|1|This product is not to specifications.  The insertion bolt attaching to motorcycle is 1 in shorter than the manufactured part and does not allow you to fasten to the motorcycle.  I have waste my time and money buying this product and now have to take to a dealership to find the correct part.
B000E7SY02|4|a little bit complicated to transport bicycles with full suspension because it didn't fit as the road bike but, when in place was very good. I used it to transport 2 bikes from NY to Miami both ways and I had no problems at all. It's very practical and no noise or estrange movements. very happy with it. easy to handle it.
B001R93K0K|5|Love these stickers.  Good quality!
B0049YX4HY|4|Good weight to this keychain & seems well made. Should stand up for a while.
B00KTJ9I46|5|It worked as promised.  At first I was having trouble programming the fob but I was not inserting the key quickly enough into the ignition switch.  I found a utube video at show how quickly the person in the video did it and it worked perfectly.<br /><br />Here is a link to the video.<br />&#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30TBRP1Mn5w&#62;
B00BITJB20|5|All I can say  is perfect fit.
B0009V1WS4|5|Perfect for my use to secure my bike rack.
B0009TO4G8|5|good thanks
B00B9W4IHY|5|this is really great! my tires looked brand new after using this. thanks!
B00B2FCCDK|3|I had issues 3 of the 20 lug nuts not threading onto the wheel studs properly and 1 more that had some difficulty threading onto the wheel stud.  So I needed my tap and die set to clean up the threads of 4 of the 20 lug nuts.  The other 16 had no issues.  Next time I'll buy the Fore Racing Performance Parts 1/2-20 open end lug nut set.  They do cost more, but I never had issues with their threads.
B001YIK34A|5|Nice product and service
B00157TGXY|1|Did not keep down the odor, even tried adding a second to no avail.
B00M9M8X1K|5|Excellent just what the package said. Way more comfortable ride without the butt going numb in about 30 miles. Rode comfortable all day. Love it.
B0066IUDSY|1|started on fire in the car

B000CO8ZP6|5|We had searched everywhere and could not find this part. It works great.
B00G0P0GHQ|5|Fits perfect.  OEM product.  Cheaper than going to the Toyota dealership.
B00GUCRISO|5|Put it on 2005 Jeep to eliminate splash back problem.  Worked Perfect!
B00K5OSPLW|5|How did this item meet your expectations?<br />OEM item - needed for a new Merc. o. b. for small boat....met specs
B00538TU8C|5|fits great
B00X9CTESK|5|I bought this for my son who is a chef and he LOVED it.  He put it in the window of his truck.
B00TXVNZQI|5|I love this cover. It's well made and so classy. It is solid. I believe it will last a while. I am quite enjoying this product.
B000EVWDU0|5|meet my expections.
B00A9OCKM8|5|WOW what a difference it made to our Ram 1500, the front of the truck looks so good we have the chrome grill so now we have more chrome out there. To me it was one of the best things we could have done to the truck to enhance it.
B002E1AYTU|5|great
B004QM5PI0|5|I like the fact that it will fit small, medium and large kids sizes so when they grow you don't have to buy a new helmet
B004YR4DVW|5|Not exactly a match with what I had already but I was able to make it work. Great price though and delivery!
B00LAVLDLI|5|Works good
B007UH4B8I|1|This product did not fit in my 2011 F-250 super duty as stated in the description. The installation would require me to cut two big squares of metal out of my tailgate; if I wanted to go that route, I wouldn't have pruchased this particular product. I am currently waiting on my refund.
B00X3ENPJ8|5|Works exactly like described. I like that it's a strong, Heavy duty item, will last a long time.
B00PKKBVFS|5|My son in law bought a new truck and had this sticker on the old truck. He was very upset that he was not able to transfer the sticker to the new truck. When I was able to order the exact one from this company I was so happy. And when I gave it to him he was over the moon. The quality and delivery was spot on. Thank you Barefoot Graphics!!!
B001MU5LBA|4|The plug wire set is great,
B00FQ4XQ4W|5|Great looking decal with highest quality. Excellent customer service from supplier. Be careful on installation and read ALL &#34;picture&#34; instructions on website carefully!
B000I1IWVA|5|It worked well
B00N8LSD02|3|does not come with ballast mounts, thats something extra to have to purchase. i did not see in the description that you would need mounts or that it came with mounts. have yet to install so im giving it 3 stars for now
B002969BQW|5|This product is great for removing wax from automotive finishes.  I think some people expect it to remove hard stuck on grease and containments.  It removes some, but not all.<br /><br />I removed the side molding from my truck and used an eraser wheel to remove the left over adhesive.  The eraser wheel leaves a residue on the paint and this Prep-Spray removed it no problem.<br /><br />To wax my car I use Dawn Dish soap to remove the majority of contaminants and wax and then I use this Pre-Spray to remove the remaining wax and soap residue.  This product doesn't leave any residue behind so the surface is reading for a fresh wax or new paint.  Depending on your project.<br /><br />There are harsher cleaners out there if you're looking for something that removes everything.
B00WV055CK|4|Fits my 2013 RAV4 LE perfectly. Holds a decent amount, but I primarily bought it to keep items from rolling out of the trunk when I open the door.<br />Definitely worth the money.
B001XUBAVO|5|Gotta love em
B0074OL2I4|5|Fast delivery.  Packed really good.  Great quality.
B005G87LTO|5|Absolutely awesome, fits great and reduces the heat inside an all black interior MDX by a considerable amount. It's still hot inside, but atleast the seats don't burn me anymore
B0054RYEBA|5|thank you
B001AWFTDA|5|Hands down the best! I went 11 years before changing my original stock YUASA battery, and not because it went bad, just because I was moving and performing other maintenance actions on my 2003 R6.  I don't even own a battery tender, I have let my bike sit for over 180 days, and it would fire right up, I will stick with the YUASA brand!
B006OKXNFE|5|Replaced the stock air filter on my '13 Expedition with the AEM 28-20385.  It appeared to have similar airflow characteristics of the stock filter but is serviceable.  Product appears to have been well made but my only concern is AEMs tie to K&N who has a spotty record at best for their filtering abilities.  I will monitor my oil samples to see if there is any rise in contaminates and report back.
B0052WHJY6|4|I have a 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Turbo 2 and they fit. The only problem is they are noisy, so I remove when I am not carrying a load.
B006ML3O8Q|1|Leaked oil as soon as it was installed
B00IQWP42I|2|Flag had their business logo printed on the flag ?
B00ONO66W0|5|Great cover. Put it on my New F150 and fits perfect.
B00W6J41C6|5|Love this! It adhered to my car window with no issues, and still looks great months later!
B00L77Y3NA|5|LOOKS GREAT
B001CQWM8E|5|It fits and looks better than the stock Polaris mirror.
B0046BLIDW|5|I am very pleased with this product!! They match the interior of my vehicle perfect!! I will definitely be shopping with you all again and soon!!
B00LOT645Q|3|Works well but overpriced.
B005WIF4NI|2|the fabric hood pretector donot work as its said and the bottle was leaking so i did not like it and for the price ,it is not good
B00B26JDY0|4|its cool thats about it
B00AXQ8G7U|5|Its perfect!  It was a tad bit smaller then I expected but I  am in love with it! Looks just like the original Bob-omb and is a nice shot of nestalgia :-)
B00DJWAMG8|5|I love the Steelers, so of course I needed these for my Steelers license plate frame.  The screws I had were too big, but my dad used his belt sander to reduce the diameter of the screw heads,  (screw heads, haha!)  and they fit fine.  :)  I plan on getting more for my little Honda..
B0044AXQAI|5|Works great on 2008 Corolla S. Was overdue for a filter change, this one fit perfectly.
B007WR25GG|4|My hubby and I planned a family visit driving from North Carolina to the Gulf Coast of Florida (and back again, of course) with our 18 month old granddaughter.  We had plenty of room in our GMC Acadia for all our - and baby - stuff.  We only needed 1 of the second row seats (for baby's car seat)  and could fold down the 3rd row seat completely for plenty of storage room.  Well that was until 2 of our grown children decided to tag along at the last minute.  OK we now needed all seating and no longer had room for everyone's stuff!!  Years ago, we had a hard car top carrier (XCargo from Sears) but had gotten rid of it as we didn't use it and it took up way too much space in our garage).  I started doing some research on a viable option (short of leasing a larger vehicle or buying another unwanted hard roof top carrier) and saw these soft car top carriers.  I read a ton of reviews and decided to give it a try.  The only other decision was what capacity to get - not too big, not too small, but just right ha!  Each adult was limited to one large duffel bag - as there was a lot of &#34;baby stuff&#34; that had to go with us - and everything fit, no problem.  My hubby said it was pretty easy to put on the car and loading was ok once you got the bottom layer squared away.  It did shift slightly to the rear on the way down (my Acadia has cross bars but nothing in the front to fasten to).  It didn't blow off the car or anything but like I saw it did shift slightly toward the rear of the car (the fixed antenna probably saved it from sliding off!!! as that stopped its backwards momentum).  We did check it on each stop to make sure it was still o.k.  On the way home my husband tightened it down more, and it didn't move at all.  We did not experience any bad weather so I can't comment on the leaking issue that other people had.<br /><br />Conclusion:  carrier worked for us and we will probably use it again.  Storage is great as it has a carry case that it goes right into.  I did have to kneel on it to get it compact enough but wasn't a big deal.  A lot cheaper than renting a larger vehicle or having to buy a hard carrier.  I did see on the internet where you could &#34;rent&#34; these, but we needed one right away (and have Prime 2 day shipping) and for the amount of time we needed it, only cost a little more to purchase.  Have no regrets on this.ave to kneel on it to get it compact enough but wasn't a big deal.  A lot cheaper than renting a larger vehicle or having to buy a hard carrier.

B00TT3GGRU|5|Order and delivery was accurate and quick. Thank you!
B0002SREQS|5|Makes a difficult job easier.  OTC makes top line tools.  Have many, used them for years.
B002E39XXG|5|Perfect fit
B000BZOBAE|3|Clutch works great but does not come with throw out bearing like is shown in the picture
B00DSR49Z4|5|Very happy with the product,shipping, price....everything was A+
B00FB38C7Y|5|perfect :)
B00IGZQAZ0|5|Replaced based on owners manual 30,000 maintenance service.  Given it is external and you don't have to drop transmission pan, this has to be the easiest ATF filters I have ever changed.  Some people indicated the filter only needs to be changed every 75,000 miles or if there was some kind of external damage, but given the easy change out, why not change it when you change the fluid.
B000BGHYJS|4|easy to use
B008DREOCW|5|Works perfectly. Note these are small. Car sized, the smaller one is about 6&#34; in diameter and about 9&#34; tall, the larger one probably 8x12 or so. I love how convenient they are, and pack away small.
B0074NLIX4|5|They look like they will fit the bill, but seem a real tight fit at this point. Gotta wait til' my next tire rotation to make sure. Fingers that snap in are backed by a flexible retaining ring for added security so the tight fit may be just what the doctor ordered. they look awesome and hope the will last as long at the originals did. After powder coating the stock 16's the came on the Dakota cause I could not find any aftermarket wheels that did not look like wagon wheels that were black that I liked (limited options due to smaller 6 bolt mounting pattern, nice going again Dodge remembering the &#34;A&#34; body small 5 bolt pattern on the 8-3/4 rear ends from the 60's and 70's?!) Have always been a Dodge fan but they have done a few really dumb things over the years and the smaller, limited bolt patterns was one that for some reason keeps cropping up?!
B004HCOE72|4|I followed directions.  It definitely improved my headlight lenses.  Don't know how long it will last but worth the effort.
B000UXV9VG|5|Great
B000KKU8UC|5|My husband has not installed them yet,  however he was happy to find the correct size after many  searches.
B00AX05EZS|5|Great quality, love it!!
B00F1W5X5Y|3|Did work on my truck
B005DJFXY6|4|Not the best quality but sufficient
B00WOY2M2O|5|Fit Well on my Nissan Tiida 2007, not compatility problems, i recommend it
B0104CT40K|3|While the item is fun-looking, and soft (thought thick and durable to protect your CDs), there's a major problem.  I cannot for the life of me figure out how to actually get a CD into the flaps. They have outlines on both sides that appear to look how one would expect a cd case flap to look, but the surface area of the flaps is 100% plastic; there are no noticeable openings for actually placing the CD inside.  I don't know if I got a bad product, or I'm supposed to somehow have a way of cutting these flaps myself, but I do not recommend this product for actual CD storage.  EDIT: After working it a LOT more, I managed to break the barely-perforated plastic away, and make it so that CDs can fit inside. However, it was very difficult, and the design of the storage part makes it difficult to safely store a CD in each side of the flaps, as placing one, makes it nearly impossible to maneuver the upper lip of the CD cover.
B00JGP8I1S|5|Bought product as a gift for my mother. It's easy to install and after a day or two , she now loves this visor,
B004P1WMDI|3|The window cleaner and the roof cleaner are great but the protectant ran all over the paint after the first rain. I would probably not get it again because I mostly wanted a good protectant, which this did not have
B007TYQZVS|4|Good price and no shipping
B00LL4CCRI|4|The product works great and does its job. I just think the angle is a little strange. I didn't mount mine way up in the wheel well (illegally) which I think is the intent behind the angle.<br /><br />Anyway, I like it and recommend it for anyone who needs a cheap solution.
B00I4L8LJO|5|The right part, perfect fit and easy to install
B0096UAZ6E|4|It's great
B00FLFIKEM|5|Absolutely fabulous! Better than my expectations..completely l
B001QUHFQA|5|worked well on atv
B00PE0WG58|5|Arrived fast, properly packed, looks nice, racy, but my main idea is for a small fairing that can redirect air and dripplets of water away from the back of the bike's instrument cluster, and hide the key as well.
B010CUDFV8|4|Have been on my Titan for about a week now. Fitment is good and have been in the car wash once so I know they are sticking good. Good product at a wonderful price.
B000765MHI|5|Very good fan. A little loud but definitely moves a lot of air.
B00YMFFE1Y|5|it is an awesome product as described...on my first application and showed very promising result!<br />shipped and delivered prompytly
B009F59HR8|5|Hitch fit perfect on glitch was on my car, rust filled one of the holes on muffler side. So had to tap it out. But hitch was a perfect fit and nice quality.
B0098M5LUK|4|Would have given 5 stars, but no nuts for mounting to axle. It's a fine tread. Finally found some at a Quality Farm Supply.
B000OWXRAY|1|I bought this to take apart my Wii, but it does not work as indicated in the description. The 3-wing will not fit all the way down into hole to reach the screw. It was a waste of money for me.
B00MO9T9SE|5|This worked awesome for pulling our 29' travel trailer.  They fit our truck snugly with now movement while we were driving.  Looked nice too! We have a 2015 Chevy Silverado 1500 Z71.
B000CSGUIQ|5|This thing is huge!  Came well packed and saved my a lot from the local parts store.  This air filter is encased in metal.  Once you receive it you will better understand why the cost so much.  Well built filter.
B00FB3GDXE|5|CAME IN SOONER THAN EXPECTED AND MADE OF GREAT QUALITY!
B008ECDFSK|5|Fit perfectly!
B00265M9SS|1|Like a lot of guys are saying it DOES NOT hold vacuum for bleeding brakes, so it's basically useless for brakes
B009GO6CYO|5|works great
B00BUSOKBQ|4|nice and new will see if it holds up,should be new style
B00U6K104E|1|Basically the same sticker you get from TU these days when you're a member, except TU probably doesn't get a cut of the action.  UPDATE: Didn't last 6 months on my rig before it peeled off.
B001H1KQAA|5|Great product..good price
B00NHUN41C|1|did not fit my 2000 Jetta MK IV.  naturally broke when i smacked one on the wheel
B0000AYCF5|5|These chains were perfect for my sailboat trailer.  Shipped faster than expected, high quality, NIB, and super easy to install.  Tie Down Engineering will be my first goto for my boat and trailering needs.  Thank you
B004YB99NU|4|Like it a lot.  Not too large, but definitely not too small.  I wear it higher up on my hip than what the seller shows in their picture (I'm not a biker).  Somewhat more akin to a stylized fanny pack for me but without the geeky socks & sandal wearing tourist look (my wife took the leg strap to use for one of her garter holsters and she raves that it works well for her).  Use it for concealed carry, but the handgun must be small.  It takes the weight of a pocket pistol off the weaker fabric of most pants pockets.  Outside pocket works well for carrying my smartphone and with Bluetooth earphones this works well.  I think it would be a handy carryall for small items when flying: snacks, medications, keys, etc. kept close at hand.  Durable material with quality zippers/zipper pulls.  I'd buy it again.
B00669PXTM|5|Awesome piece I am getting noticed by drivers behind and when they pass the wave..Thanks guys!
B000CMD8KK|4|I was very happy to finally receive these lights.  I ordered two of them as I, like most people, install two sets on my vehicle.  (sarcasm!)  I could not believe that they would ship each one in a separate box that would hold both of them.<br /><br />I have yet to install them but I know they will do the job.  Since they are replacing my old lights which are 18 inches across, I will have to remanufacture the local areas to accommodate them.  Looking forward to having a much better light system on the back of my rv.
B000C59XKG|2|They are listed to fit a 1995 Wrangler YJ, but they're not even close to the proper size (they're far too small in diameter). Given the volume of positive reviews, it's entirely possible I received the wrong product, but I live out of the US currently, I have no way of returning them. The quality itself is fine.
B00NTU18KY|5|When it comes to a smartphone or a tablet or any other mobile gadget, usb charging is the most important function to keep your device running.  Luckily, the days of proprietary connectors are gone and everybody uses usb chargers with micro-usb connector.  Without a doubt it's a blessing since you can share the same charger and the cable between various devices, but the problem is that a lot of people continue using their old chargers with old cables intended for a slow lower current operation.  Furthermore, cables age due to wire bending, connector pins wear off, and connector housing latching becoming loose.<br /><br />All of these &#34;aging&#34; contributing factor are not show stoppers preventing charging of your device, unless wire is damaged and overheats, creating a fire hazard.  The problem here is that your device will no longer be charging at its maximum optimized speed.  Back in the days of 750mA or 1A chargers it wasn't a big deal.  Now with so many new smartphones and tablets with high capacity non-replaceable batteries supporting over 2A and new rapid chargers with Qualcomm QC2.0 chipset - you want to be sure charging is fast enough.  So how do you do that?  PortaPow has a nice budget friendly solution to help you with this.<br /><br />USB Power monitor is not a ground breaking idea or the only available product.  I have reviewed similar and even cheaper solutions in the past, but they were of a lower quality, had inconsistent reading (due to their own internal power draw), and had hard to read small led display.  PortaPow USB Monitor v2 is very compact, about 70mm x 50mm x 20mm, it has a full size heavy duty cabled male usb port that stores in the back, and a full size female usb port built into the device.  The display is big and easy to read, and has a backlight which you can activate with a button.  The operation is very easy, you disconnect your usb cable from a charger, plug the cable side of the Monitor into the charger, and your usb cable intothe monitor - instantaneously you will see a multi-line display with a reading of the voltage, current, and power.<br /><br />So the big question: what does these numbers mean to you?  And also, how accurate is the reading.  In theory, I would like to see current closer to advertised 2A charging, so when I see readings of 1.75A some of the loss could be due to internal power draw and also due to a typical 5-10% of reading inaccuracy and sensing resistor tolerance.  But the importance of measurement here comes from a relative comparison.  You have multiple chargers all offering 2A output and you have dozens of USB cables that look good from outside.  But when you start comparing different combinations, you want to find a pair that will give you the maximum charging speed.<br /><br />For example, I tried 4 cables with one common usb charger and found 3 of them with 1.74A reading and one with 1.31A reading.  All cables looked like high quality, but one obviously gave me a slower charging - I made a note not to use this cable in the future.<br /><br />Or for example, I had another charger that show a reading of 5.02V @1.53A in comparison to my Samsung charger with 5.44V @1.74A.  This is another example where I will be using my original Samsung charger with one of the cables that yielded 1.74A of current.<br /><br />Summary.<br /><br />If you are only interested in monitoring Current/Voltage/Power of your mobile device or maybe of your Solar Battery (very important to find physical location with a maximum charging speed), USB Power Monitor v2 is a perfect solution that will cost you a little over $10 but can save you a lot more in troubleshooting why your phone or your tablet doesn't charge as fast anymore or if you need to buy another &#34;premium&#34; cable.  And regardless of any need to monitor USB power, also check out PowerPow quality 20AWG cables.  So many companies label their cables with &#34;premium&#34; name, but never disclose the actual AWG gauge rating.  Here you know exactly what you are getting.
B00CIB1SZA|5|Perfect. I love it. Thank you so much
B000BUQOCC|5|This thing worked perfectly and my tanks now read exactly as they should.
B0001MQ7E0|4|Tres silencieux.
B009D2R5YU|4|I needed a replacement for my 50cc scooter's vacuum tube auto-petcock and I had heard that going with a manual option was the best way to not have to keep replacing the auto version.  Most of these were made to fit Far Larger tubes than I have on my 50cc...  This one is the Right Size!<br />While it functions well and feels sturdy (it can be rotated 360 without harm) it is also a little stiff to turn.<br />This means you will have to be able to grip the back when you twist it or mount it somewhere to hold it still, or the force you need to turn it may pull your tube connections off, or even tear old dry tubes...
B00E7WEFQ2|5|Love, Love, LOVE them!! So does everyone else.
B0002MID28|5|worked well to reinstall body moldings on car

B00CPSXPUW|5|I ordered this 1st for content. Second for the price. I live in Japan so was expecting about 2-3 weeks. Yes, even this small airmail thing can take time.<br />Ordered on the 20th arrived at my post office box today on the 31st. Instructions were included. and the same decal butin  two minature versions were also included. Was a nice surprise! Thank you. Oh and he even offered a new one if you mucked up. I thought that was class. Well done Sir.
B00BTL73U4|5|New bumper looks great and went on perfectly.
B00K3GBRQ2|5|Pretty dang bright. We'll see if they can last and keep up.
B00PHRU5C4|5|I have been looking for a good set of LED turn signals lights for my Honda Accord. I tried some switch back LED lights and was not impressed with the quality.  I read several reviews on these JDM LED and found that others where very impressed with the quality and how bright they are.
B000C4AKCM|4|Really helped my engine run smoother.  Probably the Mass Airflow device was original on my 87 4 Runner, and appeared to have been serviced sometime in the past.  Would give it a 5 star, but do not know if will work satisfactory year(s) from now.
B00XXUFO7I|5|I did a test in the middle of the night, and it lit up the whole block.
B0002KKHS8|5|Excellent product, performs flawlessly!
B00C5SK5S2|2|it's just OK,  it is too flimsy and falls over too easy.
B00SD2JI7I|5|Great gauge set!
B00NS191I0|5|Most frame sliders are attached by replacing the engine mounting bolts with longer bolts, provided by the manufacturer of the slider. Some of these bolts haven't the necessary requirements for that use, and most bike manufacturers don't approve that exchange and may void the bike's warranty. This is the only frame slider that doesn't mess with the bike's engine mounting bolts and requires no drilling to be assembled to the bike, besides its mate black finish looks cool while adding protection to the bike.
B005JPJNVI|5|Beast pads ever
B00XX3VF32|5|I put my decal on today, it was so easy and looks GREAT!!!!
B001KOBMRU|5|solved the problem i was having (stuck needle valve) good price
B00WGSU9EQ|1|My car has been keyed at least five times since I put this on. People hate me for it.
B007G96ZLQ|3|Difficult to apply. Bubbles in the vinyl.
B00R45MWOG|2|This is a very common trunk on Amazon. Do not pay more than $50 for it!
B000C9QEF4|5|Great filter at a fair price, very happy!
B00JF5LRN0|5|Great cargo cart.  Fairly easy to assemble initially.  Easy to put on the car and take off.  Love having the folding feature if we aren't ready to take it off but still want to park the car in the garage.  Great for traveling with an ice chest.  We have so much more car space with the ice chest on the cargo carrier.
B004SG058Y|5|Good shocks! No issues.

B007USCM7E|5|I am a 53 year old man with basic auto mechanical skills that I picked up playing with hot rod cars as a young man.  As such, I am always a tad skeptical of products that claim to turn an expensive, complicated task into a cheap, easy one.  Nonetheless, I spotted this product at Home Depot and decided to give it a try.  I have a 1998 Toyota 4Runner SR5 V6 SUV.  It has 280,870 miles on it.  The A/C system has had slow leaks for several years because I do not drive this car frequently and sometimes the A/C seals dry out.  This year the summer temps here in Texas were over 100 degrees for half the freakin' season but I positively HATED the idea of paying one of the local auto shops around here over $150 just to &#34;test and recharge&#34; the system, so I paid the $40 at Home Depot and gave this a try.<br /><br />First, I went on the internet and watched the A/C Pro videos on YouTube from both the manufacturer and from other customers just to be sure I fully understood how to use the product.  Then I went and got my safety gear (mechanic's gloves $14.99) and safety goggles ($1.99).  Then I went to work.  Turned on the car.  Turned A/C on MAX / High.  Located low-pressure port and unscrewed cap.  Removed safety cap from product.  Screwed gauge/trigger assembly back on can.  Shook can vigourously for one minute.  Snapped coupler at end of hose onto low pressure port.  Checked pressure reading.  Mine was at ZERO, so just about all my freon was gone, which I knew becuause there was no chill whatsoever to my A/C when it was turned on.  Began by squeezing trigger while holding can straight up in 12 o'clock position.  After 10 seconds rotated can to the 3 o'clock position for another 10 seconds.  Released trigger and read guage.  Virtually no movement.  Repeated the process again, checking my guage every 20 seconds to ensure I did not overfill the system.  Guage slowly began rising until finally I has about 38 pounds of pressure after 5 minutes.  Removed hose from low pressure port.  Re-shook can.  Re-attached hose and repeated previous process to drain last of freon out of can.  I was in the green zone at the end, having spent about 15 minutes doing this very carefully, but I still probably need a second can to finish because I never quite made it into the &#34;V&#34; zone referenced in the user instructions.  Nevertheless, I got into the car and checked the A/C and it was ICE COLD - FABULOUS - just like it used to be!  I am, needless to say, very pleased with this product.  Since this product included chemical sealants that are suppossed to plug leaks in the system I plan to drive it for a few days using the A/C to fully circulate the product in the system to give it a chance to re-seal.  Then I will re-check the pressure.  If it is still low, I plan to buy a second can to top it off into the &#34;V&#34; zone.  For now, though, I am MORE than satisfied.  The product worked exactly as advertised on an A/C system that had no other serious problems other than slow leaks.  I know this to be the case with my vehicle because I had the A/C system repaired last year and replaced the condensor.  The mechanics at that time warned me that the system still had slow leaks, but it has been cheaper to re-charge freon annually than to try to trace and repair every leaky part in the system for this old car.  With A/C Pro, I feel that I can do this for many more years at minimal cost since I will only have to buy the freon in the future since the guage/trigger assembly is reusable.<br /><br />All in all, a great product that does exactly what the manufacturer claims.  The system is darn near idiot proof provided you read the instructions and simply follow them to the letter.  It is very simple and should not be intimidating to anyone, even if you have no mechanical experience.  Just be sure to use gloves because the can gets very cold while charging the system, and don't forget safety goggles to protect your eyes simply because you are under the hood with the engine running and all kinds of grit and grease could be blowing around depending on how dirty your engine compartment is.<br /><br />This product will easily save me $80 to $130 annually, I believe, on what used to be a mandatory trip to the auto shop to overpay some greasemonkey to do this brain dead task.  I LOVE IT!
B00PBON8DG|5|Worked as described, sent quickly.
B001F212OK|5|Works perfectly
B004ZGNCS2|5|Great price for a factory replacement
B001D8TGJE|5|Makes cleaning the truck so much easier.
B001U04MYE|1|not what I expected. I bougt 4 of these for my field techs just to power the laptop.  2 of them new out the box did not work. keeps blowing fuses, kept replacing the original 240V,1A fuse it came with, with a higher Amp Fuse rating, 2.5A, 4A, 5A. gave up. tried on all vehicle F150 2014 trucks, even on my personal truck 2006 Chevy Silverado. again blew fuses. now the other 2 seem to get warm and stop working.  very disappointed. not for my use. returned for refund at Oreily's Auto Parts in Coachella, California.
B009O3VQ4I|5|So cute...  Lol
B00FQ0ROZS|5|I bought these lights to install on my tow truck very good  bright light
B00IV1K8U2|5|Bright and better than KC all day
B00GYGAZHC|5|This stuff is wonderful! The wax is easy on and easy off... Next trip to Maine I will be stopping in to that this man in person for such a wonderful product.
B00BW4OWRK|5|As advertised. Easy to install.
B007U93LRI|5|Awesome

B004GIUGCO|2|its not the best boot clip its my second set and the straps break
B002CBKLQI|5|great quality has been holding up perfectly for the past 6 months
B00K5IKQBK|5|Nice
B00Z7KIZPA|5|I really like this product. It keeps my bag off the floor and within reach. I also helps me keep track of my kleenex which were forever ending up in the back seat out of reach when I needed them.
B009RC2HVC|5|It took longer to find the right wrench than it took to install. Works and looks just like the factory one
B003BZZ0GU|5|Price was crazy good!
B002OUIYW0|5|Worked great!
B000COXL5A|4|Some modification is necessary to install on the rear axel of an F53 chassis. The dual wheel alignment stud interferes with the trim piece near the nut rivet which retains the outer cover of the wheel simulator. A small amount of cutting is necessary to allow room for the wheel alignment stud. I cut mine with a 4&#34; grinding wheel. This should not change the integrity of the wheel simulator although a better design would be a 36 deg or 72 deg offset of the cover retaining nut to avoid the wheel alignment stud.
B00LFL75I8|1|This wheel bearing was good for 3 days only.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend.
B00130I85K|5|Great fit. Hardware included.
B00KQ4ZMX0|1|Our technician spent several hours trying to get these to work with no luck. We bought them for a 2013 Ford F-150. They look just like the factory ones however they never worked. We took factory one from parts at $90 each and they worked right away. I haven't had problems before with buying from Amazon however these defintely didn't work for the F-150. Same part # and numbers on the TPMS as well.
B00REP0O9Q|5|best hitch I've ever owned.  Looks great.  Love the key lock and ability to turn around and hide out of the way.  The scale is accurate.
B000JUXGAC|5|Worked great and super easy to install. Is worth every penny and then some! Thanks!
B00QMWQROI|2|I've purchased light grey a color set and honestly I was disappointed. It was not heavy duty and thick, but thin. It's a good replacement for a few years, but I'm not sure whether it is really a heavy duty one in comparison with the heavy duty one I have in a vehicle.
B001BXKLNQ|5|Nice product for a radio grab and go box.
B008OXHB9S|4|Very happy with this bag, it replaced my Original Tbag from 7 years ago.  Unboxed and left for 7 days and 3500 miles.  Holds its form full or empty, no sagging over my rear fender rack.  Held up well to several miles of rain before I got pulled over to put on the rain cover.  Backpack straps made it easily carried.  I looked at one other back in which the divider between the top and bottom was removable if you chose.  That would have pushed this to 5 starts for me.  That said the other bag may not have performed so well in other categories.
B00JQL5RCK|4|It fits, but I wish it stayed on better.  Also, it blocks the latches to open the armrest (but does not render them un-operable).  However, it's a much better solution than putting my arm onto a hot armrest (Leather gets burning hot in the summer).  Also, the material is comfortable to the touch.  It's also cutting down on the &#34;wear and tear&#34; on the top of the armrest.
B00FZFOHNG|5|This trans pan gasket fit perfect on my 04 grand cherokee
B0015RC4W4|5|Great !
B00N41AMQO|3|Luckily, the lesson I learned here was an inexpensive one - that, despite their appearance, VW's door lock pins vary greatly from year to year and model to model, so much that you simply cannot go on looks and general vintage alone.<br /><br />Because, I can now testify, these &#34;Mark III&#34; (VW3000) door lock pins are simply too narrow and short for a 2000 VW Eurovan.<br /><br />So, the product on its own is quite fine, but I simply must take stars off for incomplete compatibility information on the product info page.
B0009H51LC|4|I am using it now
B009QLBDSW|5|Great
B000C1E8N2|4|good
B007ND4P0S|5|great one i like it
B00L32KKMC|5|easy to install. dressed truck up looks really good.
B00KQ81M94|5|works like a charm.  good product.
B005XEFADU|5|Only stuff that works even when it's 110 degrees outside
B00AJ1TOR0|5|great fit
B00ANZHG7C|5|Much better quality than the amazon basics mircrofiber towels, and these are bigger. Great for cars, electronics/screens etc.
B0002TDUW4|5|I am really impressed with this bed liner kit. It is simple and easy to apply. Kit comes with the 1 gallon can of bed liner, two foam roller applicators, roller and handle, 2&#34; paintbrush, and scouring pad to prep the bed surfaces.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like about the kit was the foam roller applicators. They worked great for game most part but they would start to wear out on the edges and little foam pieces would fall off and get stuck in the wet bed liner.<br /><br />A few tips for a professional job: make sure you prep thoroughly with the scour pad or 120-150 grit sandpaper (just enough to scuff the paint but not removing the primer base all the way to bare metal). I used 120 grit sandpaper for the entire job. Another important tip is masking and cover up. Make sure you use a quality masking tape for this stuff, it will save you a lot of time in the long run. Once you have masked off and applied the bed liner, take a rag with some acetone and wipe down the tape seam so that you don't have to run a razor down your swam later on, this makes pulling the tape up, exponentially easier! Gives you a better finished line too.<br /><br />A third tip would be to strive for evenness. This is some pretty thick stuff so you'll want to make sure it doesn't run or glob. Make sure to constantly stir the can while working too. The product has gritty stuff in it so you'll want to stir it up pretty good to keep it suspended in the medium.<br /><br />Also, when using the brush, rather than using a painting motion, just dab it aggressively to keep the textured feel that the rollers give.<br /><br />Cleanup is important to do right away with acetone and wearing old clothes and rubber gloves is a must! I got some of this stuff on my arm and it's still on me three days later.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a superior bed liner for the price!
B00UUBMNZ4|5|Good product!
B003WZX7UA|5|Worked very well for my application and was pleased that they were made of good quality material and they do not rust
B002T078T0|5|I bought these for my 2005 altima with 102,000 miles. It's what the car needed. The bumps i felt where so terrible, it felt the car was gonna fall apart. What a difference! I paid $250.00 to get them installed by a local mechanic.<br />The car is now very smooth and rides like new again. Very happy with the product.
B0050HZ29W|5|Got this cut at home depot with matching the active one and now its working fine to ignite my car.
B000YC6R5Q|5|Super easy to install. Great product. Would definitely recommend to family or friends.
B00BCRMAR6|3|Does not fit Scion tc 07 well, get what you pay for basically. Looks nice when they aren't sliding off the seats lol.
B00H7HSDNK|5|This  is my 2 one  and I really  like  them
B007KFMZVU|5|I needed to replace the rotors and pads on my 2007 335i. Every where I called gave me an estimate not under $700. I decided to go with these after reading the reviews from others who have purchased these. I can't say that I was disappointed. I love the way they look and they're stopping power is just as good or better than the more expensive OEM BMW parts, and they come with the sensors!! I will buy this brand again!
B00E1ETJNU|2|Decent quality of materials but it does not fit the 2015 BMW X5
B00062YUUS|4|Nice item...it came in handy.
B0002LWEWY|5|Works as intended, and a heck of a lot better than the generic one I have. Wish it were a bit cheaper.
B002XL2IBS|5|My heater was very dirty inside and this really worked very well.
B004SG5L5G|4|Exelent..tks
B00JGRVT8U|5|This works great! Came with everything I needed to replace the brakes all around fitted in an hour. Car stops faster, quieter, less brake fade than stock parts. Looks nicer with the slotted and drilled rotors. NOTE Audi electronic parking brake requires a tool to release it this is NOT included (vag-com, ross-tech $350)
B00ECWHEAG|4|great look on my 00 chevy but bumper light lens came unglued with in 2 months and i tried baking them back on but they keep getting moisture in em .... and taillights look great but three bulbs went out as soon as i hooked em up
B007GR8BF6|5|Bad ass helmet
B006654UDQ|5|Love the Lindstrom tools.  Very well made.  A brand you can count on.
B00L4TF32G|5|Been using this stuff for years. It's amazing.
B00EN4FZ0E|5|Lettering on 8&#34; x 3&#34; sticker is just over an inch, smaller than I realized.  Overall good product.  Instructions state product, on installed, is permanent.
B000C01TUS|5|Just a quality product I installed on my 2004 Jeep Wrangler Tj
B001G72SKQ|5|Installed these on my 1970 VW bug, and they are much brighter than the old 7&#34; sealed beams. Best of all, it's a straight forward replacement, without any modifications to the wiring or housings.
B00EQ1IOS4|5|Second kit - this one is the highest quality at the best price
B000C7Z9U2|5|great fit works fine.
B005N6X7HE|1|Too small
B00M3JTSS6|5|just as bright as i expected, 1/2 flood pattern, 1/2 spot pattern is just what we needed
B001DKRGLM|5|I've tried a lot of different brands, but this one is by far my favorite.
B00DSGIUX2|4|This product does reduce noise. Install is easy.  One problem is the slip on end does not have a slit in it.  Without a slit or cutout you cannot tighten to tailpipe. Mine is just sitting over it. does not not really leak without the clamp
B004X8PZJG|1|Black tabs broke the 1st time we used it
B001EOV3JS|5|Easy too hook up and so far so good, works very well and has a plenty long enough wire.
B001OMKH7Y|5|Exactly what I needed
B003VAUQ2I|5|Great Piece of Gear For Your Jeep...!
B00UT1BI10|5|I bought it for my nephews 1st birthday and he absolutely loves it! Great quality and perfect size
B00QSHWO9Y|5|Great door at an even better price. No instructions in the box, but hey its doors, not hard to install. Holes are slotted for adjustment to keep tight and allow for machine differences. They seem to be made of thicker material and should last the abuse.
B00B1AKEN6|5|works perfect. love the material... would never get a (shiny vinyl) cover ever again.. this looks clean all the time, all u have to do is hose it off ...works great for my 2014 Titan..I have the rail system, did have to turn rails upside in order to have the clamps fit(install) correctly..<br />was worried about getting a good install..all titan owners with rail system be assured it will work just reverse rails.
B00JGP8I1S|3|good bur not wide enough.  also put on other end of visor .
B00KSJPYWW|4|It adds a lot of bulk to your key chain so I wouldn't recommend adding to it. It looks cool though.
B00COGK3O6|5|Easy to use,time will tell.
B00368PXJG|5|great part i love this switch
B009G4C7V6|5|Good quality paint, will look great on my 69 Ford
B003VLBPJA|1|Absolute crap
B001C6JCTQ|5|Solid product. Perfect fit for the broken original.
B00SYEYRQ2|2|Color did not match my vehicle. However, they have great customer service.
B000M5YZFY|5|Evrrything ok
B004GD5FQG|5|Thanks
B00FC22K6S|5|These work great! Much better than I expected and the mounting adhesive pieces are incredibly strong!
B00LIAOVLU|5|I waited about a week before writing this. After about 10 mins of use the first time the color came and they light up beautifully. Perfect fit and everything.
B00IRYQJZQ|5|This smoked shield is fantastic. Works great for my daily commute where I'm looking into the sun both on my way to work and home. Extremely difficult for others to see in, but great for seeing out of. Even at night, the tint is not so dark as to obscure your vision. Have never had problems with the shield fogging up, even when its cold out and I get on my bike immediately after working out. I've had it for a few months now and only have one tiny nick in the outside from setting my helmet down too roughly, but would definitely buy it again when I need to.
B003UTH088|5|Works as well as the original.  Easy to follow instructions for initial setup.
B0018YE9FE|2|They are very noisy even after two adjustments. Would not buy again.
B001TYGLXQ|5|My car seats are filthy mostly due to dogs, and children in the back seat. This is a great way to spruce up the interior of a car without spending a small fortune on detailing it . I did run into a problem with installation since my back seats did not lift they way the instructional video stated . I needed smaller arms to be able to link it under the seat . All in all it is a good temporary solution to a dirty seat problem
B00GT5ULB8|5|Good product for law enforcement . try to buy it from their website as its cheap over there. You can save about 25 boxs.
B00ISF4D02|1|those look bad look how loose the leather is
B005EPLJ9W|4|They work just like OEM but the buttons don't feel as solid as OEM. You can't beat it for the price. If it breaks I'll just pick another one up. It'll still be way cheaper than buying one from the dealer.
B00BG3KJGU|5|Better than stock; bolted right on, color matched, power mirror smoother than original, price is right!
B00K1NTSY0|5|Ordered the wrong sensor so it was sent back and reordered the correct one
B000Z4K25O|5|This was great buy it was easy to use.
B005H2L4V0|1|Unhappy with the product because it has no suction whatsoever and within a minute of trying to use it it started to over heat making a noise as if it was going to break down or something
B00YGQNWWM|5|Easy to install and works good on my bike.
B0044PSBOE|5|Awesome
B00IMVNKOM|5|Great nozzle and was delivered faster than expected! Thank you!!
B000H94F6E|1|I do not believe that I ordered this.  I had thought of getting something like it, but did not and do not recall ordering this.
B00480J4KA|4|So far work great on my 2002 Maxima.
B00412YT8W|5|WORKS GOOD.
B00WRARLU8|4|very good product
B00BYH6C1E|4|Sure works --especially in the small car like the Miata!
B00CPGGZNS|5|These were gret for the money
B003YKXTSI|5|ok
B0050D1GH8|5|This item met all of my expectations.
B0010DLIKW|1|Where camber fit hub you do have to some grinding
B00L6MT50M|5|comes packed in plastic sealed bag my guppys seem to enjoy eating it
B00TPI4WXY|5|Fit perfect. Husband liked .
B0009IR0PQ|5|We use it constantly to clean a microsuede sofa. Spray it on evenly and brush in one direction and let dry. It has prolonged the life of the sofa. Tried so many other similar products and this is the best. Picked up one called Blue Magic by mistake so be careful.
B004L1S9JS|5|prompt delivery, pretty much what I expected
B00498DSM6|5|Perfect fit for the 3.5 liter 2010 Honda Pilot.
B00E3M82XI|5|This truly is an amazing product in the way it makes a difference in the cabin. Now the A/C is blowing odor free air where before it would blow melted glue/moldy smelling air, especially in the A.M. or after the car had sat in the sun. The install was easy, however, it's best to have a plastic trim molding removal tool kit so that you don't scratch any of your car's plastic components, depending on your car. Installed it myself and saved over $100 compared to what I would pay at the dealership!<br /><br />P.S.: a good thing to do is to turn off the A/C about 5 minutes before you reach your destination and to just let the air run to prevent any of the mold/bacteria build up.
B008V655AU|5|Very comfy..... And perfect for rv.
B000CQFOD0|5|Fit perfectly & easy to put on.
B00M9WLEDE|3|I actually got this for a Honda Fit as it is a universal cover that will fit any small steering wheel.  It fit great, looks nice, and seems like a quality item except for the awful smell.  I aired it out for 24 hours, but there was still a nauseating smell.  We've had it on the car for over a month and there is still a strong smell that gets stronger when the car is in the hot sun.  The smell rubs off onto your hands and it is very strong.  Sometimes I have to wash my hands multiple times to get the smell off.  Luckily it is on a car I rarely drive, and the other driver doesn't seem to mind the smell.
B00HK1GLJQ|5|Money! This thing works like a charm and is easy to set up.
B004SP195I|5|An easy to apply, good looking alternative to fooling with a caulk gun for sealing small seams. Not sure how it will stand under heavy conditions but works well in light rain and wetting.
B004M95W5S|2|I did keep the cover, although I didn't think it was what is should have been, it did not really fit the winch the way it should have, the method of securing it (the straps and slide locks) was pitifully designed, my winch was a Smittybilt, so was the bumper it's attached to. A design allowing more versatility for the wiring, and securing it to/over the winch would be the fix. The material it's made of seems fine, maybe a Velcro redesign, and addition of some straps would be advisable as a redesign.
B00AECSU9C|5|Received in timely manner and was as expected.  Very pleased.
B00VVJ56B2|5|Perfect fit with a nice finish on it too!!!
B00KLELSX8|5|Direct hook up with the harness. Took me about 30 min for a good install, and to find the factory plug in just right of the steering wheel a little below the radio. There is actually a small storage box there with the factory plug in on the back side of it if the truck you have is equipped with tow package likely it should be there. I cut a small hole in the back, plugged this in and sits right in there.
B00M1OUBES|5|This is one of the safest Jump starters on the market.I did a lot of research on the internet before getting one of these for my wife's new van. she was preparing to drive cross country with our two small children with out me and I wanted to make sure there was nothing that she couldn't handle. this is the only one that i found that you couldn't hook up wrong there are many that say you can't but see this video. I did further research the verify it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtsGATbSvJA  Also the fact that it is a back up battery for devices as well as a flash light and emergency signal give it added perks. the build quality is incredibly solid and the cables are of the highest quality it has a much heavier duty gauge than most actual jumper cables which is why it can jump start the largest vehicles. while my wife's dodge caravan is not a power house its battery is 650 CCA which is more than my 4x4 Nissan titan. i would highly recommend this for any one with a wife who is not car savvy. i want another one for my truck.
B00AAZNTUS|4|Arm rest Are grate, but the templets don't match the the holes in the arm rest, check before you drill holes.
B00E63THQA|5|keeps ice for over 24 hrs!!
B00CMKWH48|4|The hitch is great and came with everything needed. The one issue I had with it is related to the car. Installed on a 2012 Subaru Impreza. I was expecting to just bolt it into place like I did on a Honda Pilot previously. Well, Subaru only provides blank holes without a threaded insert. Draw-tite provides carriage bolts with plates and customer fish wires that work great.  A little scary installing at first but they worked wonderfully. I was worried I'd lose my bolts in a  void but that didn't happen. Why, oh why, couldn't Subaru give us threaded inserts? Installation requires enlarging the frame holes with a dremel or drill. Kind of a pain and unexpected.
B007USE1M8|5|Great upgrade!
B0042ORWNI|5|These work great!!
B00V54K8KW|5|worked as expected
B00BAZBYTU|5|Got on my 1997 s10 to try to make my s10 look better and it does look better and still plays the radio really good
B00AQ29EY0|1|Don't buy. Easily broken.
B004U3XSXY|4|My goal was to meet clearance issues to the ground compared with the round Dynomax mufflers which I had mounted.  It met my goal but I also expected the decibels to be less than the Dynomax due to the spiral baffles already in the Moroso mufflers.  It sounded the same as before.
B000GV7LKU|1|The inside of the top bend of the bar has notch in it that nearly 3/4 of the diameter of a 5mm bolt can be laid into it. There are no close up photos that show that. On Cycle Visions website, their photos show no such notch on any of their bars.  I sent the bar to Cycle visions because I missed the return deadline at Powersport Parts and so received no help from them.  I was told by the production manager at Cycle Visions that the notch is put there to keep from kinking the bar when it's being bent.  I only reason I can see for that is that production numbers must be more important than taking the time to make a bend properly. The notch will have to be filled with a weld, ground, and the bar re-chromed.  It wouldn't have done any good to get it exchanged if all their bars are that way. It's really a f****ing eyesore!
B00E1S9XBE|5|Ok
B00Q3AVZXW|5|Installed on my 2015 Audi A3 and worked like a charm.
B0081UOCZA|4|Pretty nice gloves! I bought them to use for riding my motorcycle. Needed a leather palm and the knuckle protection is cool. The leather seems quality and is breaking in nicely in the several weeks since I bought them. Great smell. Cons- the different knuckle insert is a cool idea, but in practice it's not really, because most people will just choose one then go with it. And the problem I experienced was that the velcro closure on the side of the glove that gives access to the protector pocket comes undone. I came home several days and after pulling into the garage I noticed the knuckle protector was hanging out the side of the glove. A few minutes stitching with some quality nylon thread and I doubt I'll be having that issue again. But if you're not into doing a seamstress routine then look elsewhere. The gloves got wet one day as I was riding home and they took days to dry out again. Not good if you need to use them again soon. If weatherproofing is a concern then these aren't your gloves. But I keep these and a more weather friendly pair in my pack and I'm all set. Well worth what I paid.
B00JGQLZJ4|5|great product!! looking forward to going 10,000 miles before my next oil change.
B000TDV3UE|5|Works great
B00ID2P60Q|5|Easy to assemble, works great, looks like factory new.
B00H3QT6B8|5|Awesome! Came with a free nike decal too :)
B00ISM4HK6|1|The adaptor that plugs into the oem headlight wiring doesn't fit. No options to exchange
B00TZU0RAE|5|I put this meter in a 1917 Model T to track run time. Since it doesn't have speedometer I have no way of tracking mileage for maintenance schedules, the hourmeter does the trick.
B000C8ODJO|4|I wish they had included new bolts as this is a 11 inch clutch and it replaced a 12 inch clutch which I was not aware of until I received it. The bolts for an 11 inch are smaller and I had to go buy some grade 8 bolts in order to install it. But it was a good quality item,i'm happy with it
B00WMR1I64|4|Perfect for my new LED light bar. Installed in no time. Way more than enough length for my Wrangler TJ. Appears well constructed and so far<br />handles the heavier amp lights well. This company also has a model of harness with two separate leads for mounting twin lights if that's what you have.bI do plan to replace the switch with one that is a little more 'cool' looking, but that one included with this harness is adequate. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is the somewhat vague instruction paper, though I already knew where everything went from prior installs. You can go to Youtube and any questions are more than answered there for wiring auxiliary lighting.
B00KTIUPPI|4|good to have
B004GC9HO8|3|Not quite as thick as the original ford bumper, But it will do.
B004RDNOTA|5|Perfect fit for a 2009 Sienna.  Easy to replace.
B00407TVTK|5|Perfect match!
B0050LU2GQ|3|for the most part these are pretty good, but one of the magnets came off one of the placards. can't find a glue that will hold the magnet on.
B00E1SNDVU|5|Fit my '99 Ranger perfectly! Ran really smooth out of the box and came pre lubed, so all I had to do was install it. Installing it was a bit trickier than I had hoped because of some metal on metal bonds the old wheel bearing had (would recommend getting some anti sieze if you're doing the install yourself) on the rest of the assembly. I've had it on for a couple months now and it's still holding up well. Only purchased one for the passenger's side, but am now going for another one for the driver's side as it's starting to act up too. I would highly recommend replacing both sides at the same time as they, unsurprisingly, wear out at around the same rate. There's a two pack of this exact wheel bearing on Amazon somewhere for cheaper than it would cost to buy the two separately, I'd go for that one if I was looking to replace a wheel bearing.
B000WJEU78|1|The product sent did not fit my motorcycle even though the listing specifically said it would fit my KTM 2010 990 Adventure.  I was on the road in south Mexico when I tried to install the product.  In the end, I reinstalled my OEM frayed cable, which reinstalled with absolutely no problem!  I  think that I was possibly sent the wrong part, because I cannot believe that Motion Pro would sell something like this as a replacement for my cables!  I am a competent person at installing parts such as this and it was no way to make it fit.  I tried to modify it to work and it simply would not fit.  Very disappointed and now in south Mexico with a damaged throttle cable!  Donnie W. Jennings
B000C3ZDE8|5|I like my vehicles mostly stock, no lifts, no crazy aftermarket stuff. I researched a lot to see what people said and most people said these shocks were too firm/stiff, I disagree. I put these on my 96 reg. cab 4x4 2.7 toyota tacoma and I am highly satisfied. My shocks were shot, these are nice, and great quality shocks. They ride awesome, pretty smooth, not jarring. I would recommend these to anyone.
B00TEP5E62|5|Works just fine
B009S31VVW|5|Fit perfectly. Great transaction!
B00Y2CJ95O|5|Great product, fit just like it was suppose to and looks great

B00BLPTU5E|2|this product work ok on my helmet shield, but i bought it for my windsheild and did not do what it claim.  The windsheild is 10 years old, and the only scratches are from cleaning it over the years. you only see them when the sun or bright light is directly even with the shield. I try 3 or 4 times and the same resaults. I would not recommend this product for older windsheilds.
B003WDEYPE|5|Works fine with my Battery Tender Jr.  Costs less than the version sold by Battery Tender.
B000BUU5XQ|5|Love that they nest together and come with the strap. Wish they were green or black or something a little less bright. But quality is good.
B001DKRF2M|2|I hooked it up the way it said to hook up and it left me stranded on side of road. Killed the batteries. It's probably a good isolator just need more directions.
B001FCAT6C|5|This was extremely easy to install. It keeps my camper above 50 when used alone and the weather is below freezing. Best of all, its electric, so you're not using propane to heat your camper while you are away.
B0140WRX62|5|This set of car windshield screens comes in handy for a variety of reasons. First of all, they help to block out the sun from your car. Secondly, if you are into photography, they make a nice reflector for lighting. This set has several different sizes included and is meant to work with different windshield shapes and sizes. These are great because they are collapsible and lightweight. Highly recommended for any car owner.<br /><br />&#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

B000CCOK48|4|This worked great, did the job, etc., etc.  However, I didn't realize that this isn't clear . . . so make sure you read and label, because at half the price of the clear, you're going to be disappointed when you can't see anything through the oily color.

B00E5OUOCQ|2|the important product measurement is the support wire height. This is not a spec that is easy to find.my wind shield is 32 tall and in order to fit correctly the support wire needs to be at least 31.75 tall. this model is only 26.75 tall.

B000WJF7FC|4|Does perfectly the job, i.e. warns when tampered with. The pager is definitely a plus.<br />Three minor concerns though:<br />1. Starts beeping as soon as the shackle is out of the base, kind of a pain...<br />2. The on/off system (turning the key once or twice) is kind of tricky (or it's maybe me...)<br />3. The blinking on/off signal bulb is weak, almost impossible to see on a sunny day

B002UBZLGA|5|Arrived quick and was an exact replacement for the battery disconnect switch in my RV.  Original switch manufacturer was sigma but looks like they are now selling under the brand JR for this one.

B00IS6RIR6|2|Logo was stretched vertically to the point where it isn't the same logo anymore. It appears as if they rotated the logo 90 degrees, but stretched the dimensions to fit the same area. The vinyl looks fine, but it's simply no longer the logo. I'm not sure if there was an error printing it or all of them come like that, but I won't be putting it on my laptop now.
B00S9OM09I|5|For starters I managed to drop it from the counter to the floor and it didn't break not did the rhinestones come off, so it is definitely sturdy, the rhinestones are very glittery not dull and I like it because since I've had some previously you can usually see the glue and I think it's very nicely and neatly made(: thank you !  I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review
B00B7QEYD0|5|Perfect fit - once we got the right Explorer version.  Really appreciate the owner taking time to work with me and find the right cover.<br />It is just right.

B00C5TCB06|3|Whenever I order something off the interwebz the first thing I do is read the reviews. I fount it surprising so many people who bought this did not bother to read the ordering instructions !<br /><br />What ever you do, if your steeering wheel already has a factory leather cover, DO NOT REMOVE IT !<br /><br />I put this in a 2003 F-150 which has a big 15&#34; wheel and took the “C” size cover. It fit perfectly. However, as noted by several others the “holes” are simply pinpricks and more for marking than stitching. Open them up either by using an awl or a dremel mini drill.  I’d also suggest throwing away the cord and needle supplies and use a heave waxed cotton thread with a curved sail makers or upholstery needle. Most sewing departments in local stores will have curved needles. Get one it really helps.<br /><br />If you’re confident in your skills use a thread in a contrasting color it’ll look really cool.<br /><br />It also helps if you know the fundamentals of sewing which is not considered a manly skill these days. You might want to do a search on the process known as a “baseball stitch” where you guide the needle over and under then back over the two sides of the cover. This stitch will pull the cover together tightly if you do it right,<br /><br />If you find the cover getting crooked as you sew it don’t worry. When you finish a section off grab the newly stitched section and twist it with both hands. You’ll need “man hands” to do this because if you stitched it correctly it will be difficult to move.<br /><br />The hard part will be large flat spokes. You will get some bunching and it will not lie flat because you are taking what is essentially a two dimensional object and forming it around a three dimensional object.. You can form this bunching into pleats if you know what you’re doing and you’ll need a modified running backstitch. Its difficult to describe but you’ll need to have a stitch which will pull the leather together along the front side of the steering wheel and then work a locking stitch back in the opposite direction before proceeding forward. Depending on how many spokes your steering wheel has you may not have this issue (more spokes = better as more spokes generally mean narrower spokes)<br /><br />The pic is the finished wheel.eering wheel and then work a locking stitch back in the opposite direction before proceeding forward.

B001ABMU7E|5|great
B0009IQZPW|4|I am giving it a 4 star not because it's not good as a product but I think its little expensive for what it does. 2 applicator pad for 6 buck is little over pricey but again the quality is what you expect from meguiar's I have used it very harshly on my car and it does not scratch you paint at all.  Highly recommended if you are waxing your car or even compounding.

B0002SRF4O|5|Before trying this tap, I got another at a local auto repair shop.  That tap did not have the two sizes of threads and required the spark plug hole be enlarged with a drill before tapping - it was just a generic thread tap.  A drill bit to make that hole would have been $20, and it wouldn't have reached all the way down the spark plug hole to the threads anyway.  So I upgraded to this kit.  I greased the grooves and ran it in with no problems (occasionally reversing the tap 1/2 rotation to help with the cutting).<br /><br />Afterwards I blew out the cylinder with compressed air and screwed in the adapter on a spark plug.  Fit perfect.<br /><br />Started the engine, and it ran but made a clicking noise.  I removed the valve cover and found a broken seal from when the spark plug blew out, fixed that too.  Put together again, still clicking.  I was worried I'd have to pull the head to figure out the problem, but first I drove the car a bit and observed the noise.  On return to driveway the engine sputtered a bit and died.  Turned the car on again and revved the engine in nuetral, the clicking grew more random and then suddenly stopped.  I think an aluminum shaving was in the valve seat and the higher rpm (ie more 'wind' through the valves) blew it out.  After that, car worked perfectly.

B007ND4P0S|3|Not very bright compared to new LED makrers on cars, but equivalent to stock brightness. Does achieve the white led look rather than the stock yellow look. If you wan't really bright this isn't it. If you want a cheap alternative to get the led look, more or less this is a fair deal.
B0015DMNIS|5|Arrived just in time and works great

B00CR9WVPE|5|I have experience with K&N air filters dating back many years (motorcycles (dirt bikes) and Rotax airplane engine).  They do the job superbly and keep hard service engines protected,  So why not in an average automobile?  2015 Mazda CX5 GT (185 hp) is the auto.  It fit perfectly and we headed out on a 3200-mile vacation.  Results, performance and economy both improved.  The car had about 6000 miles before installing the K&N, so we had some experience in town and going back and forth from Houston and Austin.  The 3200 mile trip to NM, CO, KS, OK and TX produced an overall average of 29.7 mpg with a low of 24.94 and a high of 36.88.  Surprisingly, the best mileage came form CO, but the rest was also impressive.  Did I baby the car ... no.  Drove it normally, i.e. the way I always drive.<br /><br />Smart purchase!
B004HIZLNW|5|Very good product fits perfectly

B003PIXA1U|5|K&N 69-4518TTK cold air intake works great on my Chevy Cobalt SS Turbo, you can really here the turbo really spoll....
B001HJR9XE|3|The button was sticking had to work on it to get it working.. But it worked well after that.
B00JIARQ1O|5|Great price!
B007VWY9T8|5|Great for my saw and weed eater 2 stroke air cooled machines. Excellent price. I buy a lot fo MAG1 products and have not been disappointed so far.
B0021LQRRQ|5|love it Amazing sweater
B0045CUNT2|5|Excellent with know problems.
B00U65S2OA|5|Quality panel removal tools that worked great for removing my factory radio. At no point was I worried about them breaking on me. They seem like they'll last a long time, given the thick construction of each piece.<br /><br />Shipped quick and the nylon carrying bag is a nice touch. Overall, 5 stars.
B004M23CW0|5|I thought for the price of these liners they'd better be something special.  They are, the fit is perfect and they will perform EXACTLY as advertised.  As a critical consumer I can say that they are worth every penny of their price.  An A+ product that I HIGHLY recommend.
B00B1H3BRU|4|Good
B00F7NEREU|2|Is not rigid so it slips and has to be adjusted prior to getting into the car.
B00ANWBESC|1|Poor
B00LX620CG|3|The piece for seat belts is a bit wide and slides down but it's a cute set
B004H8V0QY|5|I had charged our vehicle twice in the last few years.  The last charge only lasted a few weeks.  After putting this Super Seal in the system, followed up by another can of freon, the system is working good.  It took a little while for the a/c to get cold, but eventually the results were very good.  It has been about a month since putting this stuff in and the air is still cold, with no signs of leaking.
B000ANQX30|4|CHARGE FULLY KEEP WHEN NEED IT
B0068C0WS4|5|good product and fast shipping
B005DSOA8M|1|Just got around to putting this on due to military obligations.  Let me tell you this, no screws came with mine nor instructions.  I will tell you know, lots of fabrication to you prior grill is required to make this one overlap.  The parts where you bolt it onto your factory grill after you cut it to he11 are tiny.  This was a mistake. I shouldn't have bought this, it's not worth my time.  I wish I had looked at it earlier so I could have sent it back :(
B00029WSVS|5|The mirror was very easy to install.
B00JL6MWIW|5|Love it fits perfect Thanks!
B00267PZUK|5|First of all let me say this is a great tool to do the job of getting broken spark plugs out of a Ford Triton v8 engine. Specifically I used it in my 2005 Ford Expedition. I STRESS read reviews on here and watch YouTube videos before attempting as one flaw is the instructions that come with the tool tell you the basics but not everything. A recent reviewer in here with a five star rating posted detailed pictures with what to do for lubrication which the instructions don't even mention. I highly recommend you read his review. I won't say everything he already did but confirm a few things where potential issues are and how I handled them. First I did put nickel anti-seize compound wherever there were threads on the tool before using except for the self tapping screw thead. On the self tapping screw thread I used high temp grease but any grease would do. The reason for using these products is it helps keep the tool from slipping or getting stuck and also seemed to help prolong the life of the threads or tapping screw. I read many reviews and those not doing this seemed to have the most problems with threads getting stripped after a couple of uses. I got 7 plugs that broke off and could have done many more I think. Even doing all these steps however I saw that the self tapping screw after 7 was just starting to flatten on one of the threads but still working fine. I also noticed that the thread on the pusher tool that screws into the spark plug hole was slightly stripped even after lubrication and I am not sure why as that should not have happened. It was still overall working however and usable. I probably could have pursued a warranty claim with the company on that one but it got my 7 plugs out so I did not take that route. Finally something I did not see reviewed on here is after extracting the plugs how do you get them off!!!!! They do not just twist off like the instructions say at least not for me. I tried clamping them in a vice and twisting off but since they are circular that still did not work. The only way I could get them off the self tapping screw was to break off the porcelain as low as it could go, put a screw in there and hammer it down lightly to push the porcelain down into the plug per the pictures, and then use a 1/8&#34; metal drill bit to drill through the end of the plug per the picture while it was in my vice grip. Why do this? Well that allowed me to put al Allen/hex key through the two holes and I was then able to clamp the plug into the vice with the Allen/hex key in the clamp so it would not spin no matter the torque. My pictures don't show the self tapping screw in the plug but it would have still been in there and you could then use your ratchet to put a lot of torque rotating clockwise to get the plug off the screw. It worked great once I figured out how to do it. I hope this helps save someone else the frustration I had. I did this with all 7 of them. It takes a little time but not bad once you get the hang of it. Regarding the rest of the tool I fully pushed the pusher into the plugs and had no issues with that. Some people say not to as they are afraid it will break porcelain or something else into the head but did not happen to me. Either way if you have a shop vac with tubing improvised to suck stuff out of the plug holes and an air spraying tool to stick into the head and blow it out there should not be issues. Another recommendation: TAKE YOUR TIME! It helps. I spend around 8 hours on this total. Fixed my misfire I was getting going up hills in the 45-55 range. Finally, if you break a tab on the coil connectors that holds them onto the plug coil use a zip tie to hold it on as much cheaper and simpler than messing with the wiring harness. One on my tabs broke and this is what I did to fix it. Finally make sure all your coils are attached when done as if you get a misfire after doing this, most likely that is the cause unless you sprayed too much cleaner in there and did not blow it out with a tool. Overall the tool did the job and I don't see anything out there that will do better. Improvements could be made on the directions and possibly the threads to strengthen them but not sure. The self tapping screw part supposedly has an updated better one the company put out with 4 straight markings on the tapping steel assembly. Mine did have these 4 markings upon inspection. Hope this review helps you and the reason I put the time into this review is the effort I had to put into researching it. I just wish I had a video to attach as well but I don't. Enjoy.ool.

B00PX4PVQG|1|Did not receive what is pictured.
B00C7XX3NY|5|quick and easy and priced right!
B005N6YFY8|4|I did not realize it had the word a hole printed on it. I have an older one that did not have that on it. I will bleep it out
B001PVSKTG|3|I do like these items. But I did have a little trouble with the rear pieces completely sealing on the top side of my door on my f150. It was as if the vent shade was a little warped
B010154OZK|3|This armrest fits my 2001 VW Passat but it feels cheap. It looks very similar to the OEM armrest. First of all its not leather but more of a synthetic material or vinyl. Every time I lean my elbow on the armrest there's an annoying creek that's a little bothersome. The whole armrest feels flimsy. Only time will tell how durable this will be.
B00IE5PR8S|5|Just what we needed!
B001C6L596|5|So far so good seems like a quality part installed without issues on 06 X5.
B001KQ9L94|5|Part is like OEM. Note.. Plastic thread is weird..should of re-tap it. Forced the 2 nuts on, not the greatest. Overall works great for the price. Easy fix.
B00B9IVRCW|5|What a back saver.  7200 lbs trailer is lifted with no problem.  Can't remember tongue weight.  But it is heavy.
B00OBEOSZE|5|Mishimoto performance air intake arrived on time, exactly as described, in excellent new condition  and packed very well.<br /><br />Air intake is of high quality and was easy to install.  Excellent fit and looks.<br /><br />I have not had the system long enough to judge whether actual engine performance increases.  I do like the 'real' sound of the system compared to the stock civilized version.
B00ARF6FB6|5|My mass air flow sensor works great an DC the price was awesome
B00NPYXAWS|5|Best gadget ever! Hope I never have to use it, but if I do, I have one! It has a seat belt cutter, It helps to break out the car window. Great add on for you car emergency kit!
B0002U2V1Y|5|very good product and not as aggressive. It would be appreciated if the bottle had more lubricant since mine halfway over, so I had to finish with water.
B00KGICAUO|4|Nice chrome version of a 10SI alternator. Chrome isn't perfect but for under $70 delivered I honestly didn't expect a show piece. The one I received did not have any excessive bearing noise as others have experienced. Installed easily as it should have and the voltage when running is right at 14.6v. Originally purchased one of their 1 wire alternators and was reading 15.5v running. Way to high and would eventually have damaged the battery. Amazon Prime made the return easy.
B004AYZBJW|5|Seem to really work in my low miles old Chevy Malibu
B001GSMJOK|5|perfect !!!
B00DV70PWC|4|Nice part but pre mounted fender tabs would have been nice.
B0002JN2EU|5|I used it on a newly purchased 2003 Camry, adding a bottle it to the gasoline tank 2 times. Looks like the mpg up little bit now
B000CPILJA|5|easy install, fair price, rear lines were about 1/2 inch too short when considering the hard pipe end at the caliper, but seems to work fine regardless. The labels front/rear were very helpful and saved time figuring things out.
B001Y8NF90|5|Does what they need to and keeps my RV awning in place.  Love it!
B00859HI12|5|A set of these came with my 2012 Passat - they're great for keeping items organized and in one location within the trunk. My only negative is that the plastic cracked and broke during low temperatures, but have been fine otherwise.
B001UJB8T2|5|Great for polishing.  Thick, soft. No smudges, and definitely no scratches.  Lasts for years.  Bought this to have more of them, not to replace any of them.  Seems easier to polish with this cloth than with others purchased previously.<br /><br />In 2015, product is definitely thick, and unlike the 2013 review that reported it as thin and flimsy.)<br /><br />It is not intended to be absorbant, but if you hold it in place long enough, it will eventually absorb, even for big water spills.<br /><br />Of note...husbands do not like it when you borrow this cloth to clean the stove - not matter how good the stove looks.
B00ZGI62US|5|Very easy to install and very nice product very impressed with it compared to the OEM piece and a lot cheaper gm wanted 400
B00ISLA1WA|5|Woks grate for my Kia Sole
B00O9EYFH2|2|These seat covers did not fit well. The back seat did not fit AT ALL. Even with the product saying it would fit the car . . . they did not. My daughter was not pleased.
B001C6L5XM|5|YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO LUBRICATE YOUR LATCH MECHANISM!!!<br /><br />I struggled for a good hour trying to figure out why the lever wasn't working, and worried that if I pulled too hard I'd break it.... turns out I just needed to lube the mechanism with some Anti-Seize and WD40.. works like a charm!
B000B8WDEW|5|product as expected. Service and shipping AWESOME. Buy from them, you'll love the experience.
B00BTMJX9M|2|very difficult to intall
B00HFQCZXM|1|I have a 38&#34; waist so I ordered XXL just to be safe.  Couldn't get these snapped even after pulling out the padding.
B003VLBPJA|5|Well made , not cheap...many uses - great price - thanks!!
B0013T7OL0|2|These seat cushions look great and I like the design and the way they fit the seats in my Honda Accord, but they stink like crazy.  An absolutely horrible moldy-like smell.  The smell makes me feel sick, plus I have quite a few allergies. I am so disappointed. They are exactly what I was looking for except for the rotten smell. Looks like I will have to return them and spend more money on better quality seat cushions. I would also like to add that I was also looking for seat cushions that were more slippery that would help me get in and out of my car, as I have cloth seats that my clothes stick to that I don't like.
B00T5X9AHW|5|Used two so far since its all I really needed but man, they are pretty bright. Brighter than many at auto parts stores.
B005R4K0VI|4|Does the job. I haven't used a sun visor in a while but does help my car not get as hot for Midwest summer days.  A little hard to make it exactly fit in the corners of windshield for a 09 Honda Civic. Does stay up in the windshield with using the sun visor/mirror from the car.
B0083LHN7Q|1|Very poor quality.  Might be OK over smooth concrete - as long as you don't walk on it or put chairs on it.  Plastic &#34;threads&#34; tear easily.  At least one place where wrong color &#34;thread&#34; used which messes up pattern (poor quality control).
B00A1X8J6S|5|Excellent product and price, fits my RX350 without problem
B003JHC4SW|5|Easy install, great looks, everything you expect from Weather Tech.
B0039Z3SPW|4|Performs pretty much as claimed and you'll be hard-pressed to find a better product for the same price. Be careful about letting the outer back and sides of the baffle touch other objects, especially objects that vibrate freely, as the baffle will readily transfer sound vibration to those objects and the resulting buzz might drive you insane, especially if you have to dig very far to re-access the installation. Otherwise, it's all good.
B00BFU84UC|5|Great product. Just needed a longer one for my trailer. Easy return and replacement with the loner crank.
B000BR51LK|5|Makes my 1997 Chevy Pickup sound beautiful. Easily recommend to anyone looking at one of these, no matter what vehicle.
B005CRVLS6|5|Great
B00MUM2EZ0|5|Great product, easy to install. very bright.
B006DD92PM|5|Great
B000EDQR50|3|A little flimsy because they are pladtic
B00V4L6BG6|5|Great bargain and nice products.
B000KIPV42|5|Perfect product. Fast shipping. Thank you. I will be back for more orders later.
B002UGYMDS|5|Works great
B00JBIACJG|5|I can see at night
B00MYF7ZZC|4|It's a little smaller than expected, but will do the job. Nice construction, seems durable. 4 out of 5 stars only because I thought it would be bigger.
B004INRUVC|5|gnsgnsgnsrn
B00J0DV13I|3|Product arrived with pretty good damage to the box. The product itself was fine, however I was missing the larger divider piece. Based on the condition of the box, I think it split open during shipping and was re-taped with the piece going missing in the process.<br /><br />Onto the product itself. It looks very nice and is thick and sturdy. On my 2015 Silverado double cab, it uses the tire change kit to secure it in place. You have to position the little clip on that piece just right, but you'll figure it out in about 10 seconds. Total install was maybe 3 to 5 minutes. The tray is shallow, but you knew it would be by looking under your seat. It does, however, keep all my stuff together and out of the foot space while remaining accessible. Does this replace a bed box? No way. But it keeps everything inside, dry, and secure.<br /><br />Would go 4 to 5 stars if everything would have been in the box.
B00LT2FBMA|5|Is good I love fast and easy to put it in my car thank you guys great job. .☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ ♡
B000WK0XF0|5|This product is outstanding I use it on my. Motorcycle..
B007S0LDME|5|I have been RVing for ten years, full time. Have tried many chemicals, none can match the Happy Camper. No odor, easy to use. Wouldn't use any other kind now.
B000E2CSVS|3|Foam stickum gasket is a pain to install on the air box.
B00CFALFXY|5|The larger size of the cloth reduces cleaning time.  Streak free cleaning especially on mirrors and windows is great.  It is the only cloth I use on my stainless steel appliances.
B0053P6ARO|5|easy to install, worked better than I expected.  was able to get into tight spots with only one attempt.  Great item for short beds.
B00MQAGSXA|5|very well made, heavy duty metal.  looks great.
B0050H5IRI|5|Yes!  It fits my large melon.  Nice fabric and the mesh is the best.  If you have a XXL hat size, this will fit.
B000VDT1C4|5|Good qualities and a great seller.
B008CE06ZA|5|just as expected
B00DDUGL48|5|they worked great and the manufacturer's customer service was Fantastic and replaced the one grip that tore during installation.
B000CMFBDW|5|Great product, comes with all necessary hardware to do the job quickly and easily with no headache. It comes with new U-bolts and nice nylon nuts as well as the steel block. In my case it was easiest to just cut the old U-bolts since there was new ones, job was done in under an hour! If you're looking to lower your truck easily and on the cheap this is the best way.
B006X8C236|5|Looks good and matched my top billet grill perfectly
B00J9U06SI|5|Looks nice easy to apply
B004HAEFS2|5|Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
B0009H51SU|5|perfectly fit on my 96 camry. and it cost less than my local auto store
B00B1OIJHA|5|GREAT GLASSES
B0089LTG3Y|5|Perfect fit for my 2007 Honda Element. It literally took me less than a minute to install this filter (I've replaced them before several times). Saved me quite a bit going through Amazon as opposed to the local dealership.
B004HYNGHY|4|works great
B0101CFGM8|5|Perfect fit for my Honda Accord or my Kia van.
B00BGZ2FMY|5|Just like it says. Love these for my keys. Gives them a personal touch!
B00V337VNC|1|Does not fit the wheels.  I was trying to return them.
B006XJM28K|4|Did the trick; however, not much room to spare
B00CP3X1WE|5|Great  cover.  Met  my  expectations.
B010H0QV7S|5|From reading the other reviews, it looks like there have been several different products sold using the same product page. One reviewer has a &#34;9 tools in 1&#34; product, another reviewer says the gauge takes 90 seconds the get a reading and still another talks about the LCD screen being oriented toward the tire. The product I received doesn't fit any of the descriptions above.<br /><br />The tire gauge I received has five total tools incorporated into it:<br /><br />► Seat Belt Cutter<br />► Flashlight<br />► Small Red Light (I think of it as a map reader)<br />► Glass Breaker<br />► Tire Gauge<br /><br />I tested each tool in the following manner:<br /><br />► Seat Belt Cutter - I was able to cut (with only a little difficulty) a 2-inch ratchet strap rated at 3,300 lbs working load, which is much thicker and stronger than a seat belt<br />► Flashlight - was sufficient to illuminate my engine and check my oil, transmission and engine coolant<br />► Small Red Light (I think of it as a map reader) -  At night, I had my wife use this light to look at a map while I was driving and it in no way interfered with my ability to see the road<br />► Glass Breaker - Luckily I have a friend who has makes old jumnk cars available to me. It took a pretty hard whack, but I was able to shatter the driver's side window of 1982 Sunbird J2000<br />► Tire Gauge - I'm very picky about my tire gauges. I have quite a few pieces of equipment that have pneumatic tires, as well as two cars, a Peterbilt and a step-deck trailer, so with over fifty tires to keep tabs on, it seems I'm always using one kind of tire gauge or another.  This gauge worked very well on most of my tires. It won't work on outside dual tires, or even inside duals unless they have extra-long valve stems, and it was a little difficult to check the air in the front tires of my 72-inch zero turn mower because the tires are so small and the forks that they mount to all but block the valve stems. For car tires, the tires on my garbage can, garden tractor, portable generator, etc., the tire gauge works very well. The head of the gauge makes a tight seal with the valve stem and the reading is shown instantaneously on a large, blue backlit LCD display.<br /><br />Overall, I like this tool. For me, all the other gadgets included are superfluous, but I like the gauge enough that I plan on keeping it in my car or maybe in my shop for future use.<br /><br />🌟 Complimentary Product Received for Testing and Unbiased Review 🌟he tire gauge works very well.

B0006H933M|5|I'm not sure I needed it, but I didn't want to take a chance on a 12 y/o unit and have to do this job again in the near future.
B000COBLJI|5|Bright as can be - very clear beam, nicely focused. These bulbs have lasted me a year so far, and still seem to be going strong - great quality. And the high-beam? It's liable to start forest fires if you blaze it out there - BRIGHT!!!
B008D6YGE4|4|It works well.  I've driven on the freeway without issue for less than an hour.
B000M5Y72A|5|Our 11 year old van needed better headlights. It's not able to upgrade to those fancy new lights so we decided to try these. They are a LOT brighter and were easy to install. I'd purchase these again.
B00B9FFRSU|5|Looks great and came in on time
B0009PSA4O|5|Really great boating mirror - east to install and adjust, very clear view, and excellent quality overall. Highly recommend.
B000QJMYUO|4|Thank y o u for being so good. The cat back system is great makes my truck sound so good.
B00B9DECRY|2|I used this product on a ten year old awning on the back of our home.  It is exposed to the weather, but does not have any exposure to tree sap or such.  The procudt did not clean much of anything off of our awning.  It foamed well.  I gave it a full ten minutes per the instructions to do its magic.  When I rinsed it off, I could literally not tell any difference.  I will not use this product again.
B00188EHSY|5|Great filter for the price.
B00QPV8B22|5|These are a really great set of brushes.  I love to use them after my boys and I have finished with crafts at the table to get all the glitter and tiny pieces off of the table.  We use our wood kitchen table and when you spray a cleaner on it makes for a hard pickup of all the tiny sparkles from glitter.  This is like a nice clean hand broom to get the job done.<br /><br />I am glad they come in a 2 pack because 1 I use inside and the other I use in our open garage.  We have a huge work table made out of a tractor trailer door which is SUPER heavy and required machinery to move it.  So it doesn't move anywhere and will be there forever.  The bad thing about it is all of the pollen that collects on the top of the work surface.  I use this brush and it easily wipes all the pollen off.  The 1st time I tried to use a wet cloth 1st and that didn't work out so well.  This does a great job.<br /><br />I would have loved a product like this when I lived in Colorado for 3 years.  I would have to use my hands to try and brush the snow off because I didn't have a handy snow brush like this.  Needless to say my hands would be frozen and very uncomfortable after the process.  With this snow brush I would have been able to brush off the fresh snow and with the foam wrapped around the handle my hands would not have frozen trying to use the brush.<br /><br />There are many uses for this brush and it is a really great quality product.  GREAT BUY!!<br /><br />Inside Package:<br />- Mini Brush (2-pack). Colors: Red & blue. Size: 12.4&#34; x 3.5&#34;. Weight: 4 oz.<br />- Microfiber Cloth (2-pack). Colors: Light red & light blue. Size: 11.8&#34; x 11.8&#34;.<br /><br />*  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B0084E7C82|5|The shield was a perfect fit and looks great!  Well packaged and delivered quickly. Very satisfied with purchased.
B0038QHXPS|4|Keeps the toilet in my house from freezing in these nasty Michigan Winters (love Michigan however)
B001CF3J6E|1|Worst thing I've bought for the jeep so far. It's extremely cheap and isn't even calibrated for straight and level. Some awkward angle creates a level pitch and roll and since it only had that one setting there are too few places to set it. Plus the adhesive strip is a joke. Don't buy.
B005EJGSQ2|1|started on fire
B00BFX027W|1|Pin holes for the mounting disconnect were drilled off center so I can't flip it 180°. Holes for power down center are to small or don't exist. I'm going to have to fix some shop mistakes and do some of my own fab, but it is all cheaper than a $200 mount for a backup cam.
B008VFWW5C|5|This product is really made well and very sturdy and fits my car perfectly!! I would highly recommend anyone to get it.
B000EVYGZA|5|I needed an inexpensive multimeter to chase a parasitic drain on my vehicle. Most inexpensive multimeters don't have the amperage capacity, this unit does. Still have part of my problem, but now have a tool to work with.<br />A decent quality meter for the price, I like it.<br />Do read the instructions.
B007QBRNO2|4|Fit like a charm , made in USA (Michigan)...so far so good.
B00080QHMM|5|Easy to use and is much more accurate that conventional pressure gauges.
B00HNKYD0I|4|okay on domestic cars not good on foreign.  Don't know why the stay on the Ford, but they keep flying off of the BMW.  probably wrong size for the BMW.
B004BTL68Q|5|Fast shipping, works great!
B00L9A38GS|3|Weird white border
B00OH0S5Y2|5|Really makes a difference especially the interior
B0021YZER2|5|Better than anything else I have tried for removing hard water spots on shower door.
B00N7KMXLE|5|Looks awesome on my tool box!
B00CNUH50I|5|Perfect fit.
B00VN0PSBW|5|Neat hat and good value..
B00BITHP7S|5|Color is perfect and came on time.
B000IYX3FM|5|It did work as expected. no problems were found and I use it a complete week all they long.
B006G14FK8|5|great product.
B000BZLDUU|5|Original part, original quality, right price, everything as expected...
B0035XGPNA|5|I can't give this product enough stars. I own a Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 with the Brembo brakes, after I would clean the wheels they would have brake dust on them within a few miles. I decided to try this product because the rating was really good, and I typically trust Armorall. Over 100 miles later and they are still perfectly clean
B003EN5LX6|1|I bought this thing a year ago, tried to use it today for the first time to remove oil from my mower.  It has no suction; would not work.  What a rip-off
B00KGGTF9U|5|I previously tried the Jumbo III which was WAY too big for my windshield but still workable. This one, while still a little big according to measurements, actually fits extremely well. Both are much better than the accordion-style foam core sunshade I had before. The rings overlap just enough that they can lie between the windshield and rearview mirror, and they're just big enough that they wedge themselves into the windshield's perimeter.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're in a market for a sunshade, get an X-Shade. For $15, it's a no-brainer. But do make sure it at least kinda fits. :) I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.
B00BGZ24RU|4|My Key Fob was broken.  By ordering this case, it keeps the Fob together in a way it will still hold my keys.  Grateful I didn't have to go purchase another fob for $70-$100.
B000OC4EII|4|Works great to secure my jet ski.  Cable fits through front eyelet. I would rate it 5 star but am a little worried about the key lock. Keep it oiled. Great construction. Great design.
B002JOVUO0|5|Many uses.
B00IKSN0CE|5|Easy to install. Adjustable which is a good feature. And big enough to see through
B005ESUJUO|3|It seems to work well enough but it shakes way more than the factory model.
B00V2W0D3E|5|Very nice.
B001ENQ44I|1|have to be redesigned once it stopped working , you should get red of it , it will start to ground the battery and drains it out !!!!
B00O9NAC1Q|5|love it
B001UC9R2O|5|Very satisfied.
B000E3EWNE|4|Works very  well.  Durable an soft on the hand
B005KFMTHW|3|This is a OEM Polaris Product for a Polaris machine. I expect it to fit & work as designed. That being said, it does do what I bought it to do, which is keep the dust vacuum out when using a front windshield of any size. Unfortunately because of the extraordinary high price the thought still lingers in my mind- &#34;should I have purchased a much cheaper aftermarket alternative&#34;. This thing is 1/8 inch thick, and has 3 plastic quick release snaps.<br /><br />Do I recommend it.....ehhhhh, not for a rear window that I intend to leave on full time, and what I mean by that is- I think what sets this product apart from the after market ones are the quick release clips that let you take this window off quickly  and put it back on just as quickly..
B001VZL2LO|5|good
B000C2WKOU|5|Good fit on 2011 Mazda 6 2.5L
B0088ARGH4|5|great

B001TMGC7I|5|Easy to install and fits perfect.
B00OMDBWQ2|5|The instructions are a little daunting at first, but after about 15 min of re-reading them, I fully understood and was able to put them together.  Wow, I love the results.  They look great and fit really well.  Highly recommend them.
B0006VORDY|5|The stove works great and is easy to clean up
B0007ZFTHW|5|excellent brake lock.  I have been using it for awhile now and it cannot be beaten.
B003P640E8|3|One order only contained one so was misleading but they are great
B00G9AFQSQ|5|These are the best wiper blades in the world.  There is no streaks at all and last a really long time.  I would recommend all day long.
B001GG8DTM|5|Terrific!
B000IYP1U2|4|Good
B005XRP34S|5|Great figment and look!
B004N6NR2U|5|Look great easy to install!!!
B00556MP3O|5|Good
B001KRK5DY|5|Simple and cheaper than an OEM Toyota part.
B002QGVW3K|5|We ordered this battery as a replacement for the one that came with our older Coleman rechargeable battery.  The old one was 6V 4amp, but we couldn't find one so bought this 4.5 amp instead.  Works great!
B0145R9IFG|3|The product arrived very quickly, and it was the quality I expected. Unfortunately, it didn't fit in my sedan, but it did fit in my husband's large crossover, and I really got the product for him because he drops much more between his seats than I do. I wish there were multiple sizes, as I would purchase again so I could use it in my car. It was easy to install, and the foam had a lot of give, so I was able to squish it between small spaces that I wouldn't have thought it would fit in.  This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
B001RQIUZ8|4|Really dressed up the truck!  The company shipped timely and product was as advertised. I would have liked some installation instructions.
B00K166QUG|5|This is a great shirt, fits great.
B000C42R9Q|5|These shocks restored my ride to almost brand new conditions. Considering I put these on a 2000 Mazda B3000, the ride is 100% improvement.
B001UCB1C8|5|Great product worked well.
B008M2XR76|1|I bought this same timer elsewhere and only work 207 hours, lost money
B005SGZCMW|5|Just as spected and fast
B004EC5CP8|1|One star is one too many stars for this product. For almost $300, I would have expected it to last longer than a few months. There are several spots where it has just started shredding and has 1 foot sized holes where it has shredded. We purchased this in February of 2015. It doesn't get that windy here so I don't understand this. Highly disappointed in this product. I do not recommend this item.
B001621FZA|5|Great products! Fast shipping!
B000NE7TJ8|3|Not a exact fit for 99 suburban. Was able to modify and get it to work
B0051S9PSY|4|As advertised and fit perfect
B009DK3XH0|5|So far so good seems like a quality part installed without issues on 06 X5.
B000E300N0|5|perfect
B00DEYGB4I|5|These got my scooter back on the road.
B000C2M9N2|5|Good quality, very good price, great service.<br />Although boxed Four Seasons, this is genuine &#34;Indak&#34; brand, the same as you'd get from Vintage Air or most of the aftermarket Rod suppliers.<br />Fit was perfect as well as my knobs fitting great.
B0007RDVD4|1|piece of junk not worth any money Cleaned my aluminum mags with mothers polish a lot of rags and good old elbow grease. Brought them to a mirror finish. Mothers is a great product, but they dropped the ball on this one.
B0052XS8Y0|5|Fit well into a 2004 Mazda 6 (4cyl).
B0055AQ2KC|5|Good price and perfect fit, fits perfectly on my Silverado 2500hd 2006
B0038YO9Q6|5|Make sure you measure the ones you are replacing as the newer and older ones are all slightly different and are not interchangable
B00MU7AJ66|5|Easy to put on and the look is awesome.  They have been on for some months now and are still holding on nicely. The color is not fading and still has it's gloss look. More importantly I feel like my radiator is safe from birds and bugs.
B00D2QL0DU|1|worked once, then no more.
B004BCHJMU|5|These fit right into the original headlight connection points and were a great replacement to the old fogged up ones
B00KULN6TG|5|Smooth and strong. With same company's Disc Brake it works on my Ford Transit very well! I see after half of the year it looks much better than original Ford's ones.
B00SGZ1DCU|5|Bright as h*ll!  Totally worth the money
B00CYW080Y|5|Works well.
B00JB4ZFTC|4|Works,fine,  but not &#34;glow in the dark&#34; it has led lights that make it visible in the dark when plugged in.
B000XS0FS6|4|Looks nice in my car
B001MXVX5A|5|prompt delivery, pretty much what I expected
B001UU0W9S|4|all ok
B00C393VQQ|5|It works about 85-90% of the time I really cant complain :)<br />You have to put it on top of your existing shims (double Shims) but dont forget to lube the shims.
B00GZHC2L2|1|I had a faulty bulb but am not prepared to pay to return it.<br /><br />I had hoped I could receive a replacement?<br /><br />Regards Mark
B00JIIZCM6|5|Leaves leather silky smooth
B006YU7G8E|5|This is the only fulid that should be used in a honda power steering system. Works great and insures that you wont need to replace a pricey power steering pump. cant beat the price either
B00W6J0ODG|3|They fit pretty good.
B005G5QW38|5|Good. As described.
B001A6VN72|5|This bag was perfect. I reviewed dozens of bags and read all the feedback. This bag is sturdy and attaches easy and secure. We have a 2014 Street Glide. This weekend we put it on the rear rack and put 620 miles on. It never moved. It never sagged. It zips easy. Has lots of room. Very well made and the best value with top quality. It was so nice to finally just unsnap and carry a bag right into our hotel. We love the side storage containers. I highly recommend.
B000BG1X54|4|Worked fine
B00IKJ7UAG|5|They fit and bolted right up needed to be greased but they seem to be working properly
B00CJWHJ0Q|5|Perfect fit!
B00029JXNO|4|Classic style
B008ESKJTM|1|Is not the same shape as OEM.  DO NOT BUY.
B00871QE3Q|5|Nice quality fit perfectly
B000MW8QKW|5|Excellent Product.  Be sure to have a 20 ton press available to remove the old bushings.  I could not imagine banging the old ones out with a hammer or c-clamp.  Product fit perfectly resulting in a great ride in my Ford 250
B0038AW6NI|4|easy install and ;ook nice on ford explorer. Only problem they lights don't project evenly. Lighting Is very scattered and random from light to light at night. Adjustments cant get the light projection right.
B002DPHERW|5|Not much to say...it works as described.
B00J0EBZK6|5|Very happy with purchase! Exactly fits my 2005 Jeep inline six jeep RUBICON:) thank you
B000KKUBNG|5|very good
B000VU9D1G|5|nfrdgnntn
B007NKPG36|5|It doesn't get any easier than this one. Easy mounting and Easy wiring up.
B00KQXKG46|5|Works perfectly I'm my bull bar and plenty bright. Will definitely be ordering another for my duck boat this year.
B000C2W8KQ|5|very nice pump
B00UFJAUEW|5|Perfect form, fit and function
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product at a great price
B00JIGZXMC|5|Tinted my 3rd brake light and the stock bulbs didn't cut it. popped these in and they are way brighter. they cut through the tint no problems.<br />Faster reaction as well...matches with my led tails/brakes.
B00JIIZCM6|5|Love the shine.
B00HAWLFA0|5|I ordered this and the light bulb board.... and the seller assembled them for me before shipping.  Which was really nice and made the install simple.  The product works perfect, fits perfect, and the price is excellent!  Saved me almost $200 by doing it myself and ordering this versus a genuine GM part.  Will order again when I break my passenger side!  :)
B00ARYC5MK|5|makes it so easy to take our bikes when we go camping with our camper, just slide the bike rack into the receiver and load up the bikes.
B00YZ5KE70|5|Exactly what I was looking for, works fantastic on our sea kayaks!
B00CBR5D16|5|Great
B001LA3FPU|5|EXCELLENT.....
B004HCS4PK|5|The Paste Wax was easily applied and the result was a great shine.
B00537FR08|5|Love it, does just what I needed it too.
B001SQ15QS|5|I am absolutely happy with the overall purchase: product, shipping, and functionality it worked above and beyond what I was expecting I have solutely plan on getting a case study for future use. Bought a car from auction had a moldy like smell but now it smells so much better and it didn't just cover it upb(I have a great nose) I'm going to wait and see how it how long it lasts but initially two thumbs up.
B000LN2JP0|5|Worked great in my 1987 Mastercraft Prostar 190 running the Ford 351 engine.  Make sure to keep the lower collar from the previous rotor cap and this will slip right into it.
B00E5A722U|5|Love them!
B00T9H5IBQ|5|Looks and works great. Feels very solid. I have it mounted to my 2012 Polaris Sportsman 500 ATV and got it practically underwater and it still works great. My buddy has a 50&#34; light bar for double the price of this and I can see my spot beam through his light.
B00UU1DPRY|5|Works Great and was a Good Value
B00WTLI10Y|5|Great and easy to install.  And love the wireless remote to control everything.  Kept me from drilling in ton my 2013 dodge ram 1500 would buy again
B000FQ96W2|5|Great product!
B00B2YHHRM|5|Installed as interior lighting on my wakeboard boat.  Much brighter than stock bulbs.  Plug and play install for my setup.
B00JGRLAP2|5|Great price.
B00076RLC2|5|Fit great, works great.  No modification were needed.
B00GI81T0I|5|This has helped make our 15 passenger just a little more complete. Makes our Stormtrooper look awesome! Good quality and cleans easily!
B00JINPJD8|5|works as intended.  I did have to push it down a bit harder in one bucket versus another but that is probably a variation in bucket makers.
B0041FXNNG|5|Awseome
B011QIHWPU|5|The safe clamps are just great, you can touch them and nothing will happen! The lights are pretty strong too. Great for outdoor activities at night or camping
B000FQ1J40|5|thank you
B00R5Y2F0W|5|This is a crowded product space.  This organizer delivers and is worth every penny.  Good construction.  So good in fact, we installed it in June for a long road trip and just left it in there.  Helps the kids keep my car clean.
B00G2Q0XBM|5|works great
B000EON01I|1|Install was pretty easy, about 45 minutes. Fits great, no leaks so far and 2- four inch rainfalls. Love it.
B0002M9QJM|5|Plug and play install on my 1972 CB500.  Way brighter than stock headlight.  Well worth the price.
B005TJW58C|5|Best spray gun i've ever used for fairly thick water baster paint,could non be more pleased.
B000C03NZW|4|it works ,got brakes now !
B00X2SSPUY|3|The product is the exact I needed, however it came with part of the mirror broken, probably due to mishandling. You.need to add extra plastic bubble in it to avoid braking.
B00OQVWP6Q|3|I mean it does what it's suppose to do...if you can get it into the car and on the floor.Def a 2 person job cause once you finally get a sheet to tear off, and it folds over, toss it. There is not peeling it back. Used 4 sheets in my car, took 9 sheets to get there and that was just the back seat.
B00K6B1H8C|3|meets my expectations
B00AMLQ7KE|5|I love these steps. Very strong and sturdy. Great material and quality powder coating.  The only thing that I had a problem with was that the last brackets marked DR and PR were wrong.  the bolt holes didn't line up and once I switched them to the opposite side, they worked perfect. I don't know how this happened but I figured it out.  Start at the front and work your way to the rear and then install the steps before the last bracket to make sure they line up and that the steps don't protrude into the front wheel well.
B00192JFBI|5|Yep! easy to install and a perfect fit for our Whitewater Retro 150 Camp Trailer.
B007ECFURK|3|after several years it's finally time to retire mine, the pastic is flaking off the bubbles and making for a very sad looking Car.
B005AKIUGG|3|Metal stickers, adhere well but overpriced for what they are
B0034ZUZM6|5|Been Very happy with this winch. Have it on a 2011 rzr 800s. It's outlasted a Polaris brand and Harbor Freight. I have had 0 issues.
B004QMDXES|5|well made and confortable
B001PWA0IO|5|Don't forfeit you man card! I almost cancelled because of other reviews on forums about how hard it is to install. BS! It was 8 minutes from open the box to cleaned up.<br />It comes with the Torx and M5 Allen wrenches. You are probably going to have to find more leverage (10mm deepwell socket with a 6&#34; extension slipped over the Torx wrench will work) because your factory-installed bolt is tight! Also, a tape measure or something that is exactly 3/4&#34; to set the nut-sert before installing (a PENNY is 3/4&#34; wide) and 13mm socket or wrench and a 10mm WRENCH (socket will not work since nutsert is held by an Allen wrench and would collide with a socket.<br />*** watch out for the number of turns on the nutsert: the instruction says to MARK the nut and do not turn more than 9 times. Mine was tight before 9.  Done. Cleanup. Play with the tailgate.<br /><br />T-50 TORX*<br />M5 ALLEN WRENCH*<br />TAPE MEASURE<br />10MM WRENCH<br />13MM WRENCH
B008G21YE0|5|Fast shipping, excellent fit, looks great. Took 7 years off the truck cosmetically and I don't have to strike a match to see where I'm going at night. Came with all new bulbs loaded.
B00PBEN5PW|3|They were ok just the instructions on the covers for the back seat really didn't tell u which one goes on bottom n which one goes on back.
B00W8DBZQU|5|Perfect fit
B009OBVXC0|5|Good Product
B000PWUX14|5|Direct fit into my 2005 Lexus es330. I would also advise that you use the Denso anti-seize that comes with it. My last O2 was stuck in the cat and couldn't get it out
B00P2D4BPA|5|Perfect!
B00EUID1FE|5|My husband is a huge UofL fan and his old frame was worn out, he's happy with the new one.
B008B5X5GC|5|Worked perfect
B00NGZ5SLM|5|Worked great!!
B00HRMSXWQ|5|Bulbs were all good! Makes the car look and feel great!
B004TC1KXG|5|i ordered this fuel pump,and i am very happy with its performance,and for the price no one can beatit..quick fast starts and powerfull acceleration.i am very happy.
B00ELR3FT6|5|I was able to replace my old lift supports with these in a matter of minutes.  Great product and service.
8016868177|5|super cute
B00OAJ5S04|4|Very easy to install. .
B000GRXA6S|2|I gave this a fair chance but should have known that there would be issues since Kerker hasn't produced these in years and these must have been old overstock and probably sold and returned at least once.  The first one I ordered came missing hardware pieces that were supposed to be in the box not with the additional bike specific kit that must be bought separately, which also is not made anymore.  Fortunately I was able to find the bike specific pieces too.  I returned the first one for a replacement hoping I would get a complete package and the replacement came with all the parts but the bike specific intake end adapter did not fit into the inside diameter of the carbon sleeve.  The carbon sleeve was approximately .010+- too small.  I called Kerker/Supertrapp's customer service and spoke to their tech guy and he said they had experienced this with the old stock universal carbon cans because when they are in stock for years with no end piece installed the diameter of the carbon sleeve shrinks. I was told by Kerker that they haven't had this problem with their universal aluminum cans if you can find one.  I opted to return the second one for a refund rather than have a machine shop turn down the intake adapter and not be able to return that if I ran into more issues.  In the end it was a whole lot of work for nothing.  The good news is Amazon's customer service was excellent and replaced the first one that had missing bits and refunded the second defective one with no hassles.
B00TPQJRPE|5|great clips.  I hooked them in the connectors in the bed of my pickup to use for tying down tarps.  With the liner installed it is hard to reach and hook to the built in bars, this makes life easier.
B004W979TK|5|very easy to install, took me 15 minutes.
B005P0BPSG|5|Mounted easily and works great
B004MXGXIY|5|easy to install just like factory made..
B002ET2O2W|5|Comes long enough you can make it fit anything
B006MIWA6Q|4|Very nice for the price. Fit could be a little better but cannot complain at this price point.
B000CNN0GQ|5|sounds good and fits like a glove
B003BVS2Z0|5|Several friends use and recommended this product.  After purchasing and using for a few months, the jack started hanging up every now and then.  This year while camping, the product completely failed.  Now and then, mechanical things do fail.  That being said, when I returned home I grabbed my paperwork and realized I was a week outside of the 1-year mfg. warranty.  When I called Ultra-Fab, they told me not to worry and immediately sent out a replacement...no questions asked.  I received it within 3 days with clear instructions on how to return the original unit and a shipping label.  I don't think I have ever experienced this kind of level of customer support...ever!  I believe I just had a bad unit and overall these seem to work very well.  My friends have enjoyed several trouble-free years with this product, so the fact that one failed is not a big deal when the company stands behind the product so strongly.
B00XE1CUOG|5|Indeed it is a D2R.  Worked perfectly in 2004 Prius.  Packaging was excellent in reusable hard plastic container.
B003DL9DC4|5|Exellent
B007G2J1JG|4|has worked great.
B004A1UNQ6|5|All hose inlets and mounting holes match the original part that failed. It was leaking around the cap inlet. It is half the price of the Dodge dealer.
B009DJTK6O|3|Part was delivered quickly and fit the car perfectly. However, the piece arrived damaged, which then had to be repaired before it could be used to replace the old part.
B004LEYJO4|5|Amazing for track and semi street driven. I run backroads all the time when im not tracking and this fluid + carbotech xp10 + SS + Factory 2 pot brakes + decent tires creates a whole new level of stopping power.
B00K5A1QGM|5|Going in my son's stocking for Christmas
B0054WI5KQ|5|Easy to read, good value for the money.
B000BK7RHI|5|Used it for my 2003 Sierra and my '03 Duramax, doesn't move much on the highway and looks slick
B00TRA4YZQ|5|Color matched, what I was looking for...
B008HZN3I6|5|My first disk break job. No complains
B00OSXIIK4|5|It fits great and easy to put in and take down.
B00TEA5PZC|5|Look good as advertised.  Good shipping and on time.
B00EP0SJF4|5|Absolutely love it!!!
B005346PHA|5|Just like what came  with it
B0029TQDLA|2|Unfortunately the first one broke within a couple of days and I wasn't rough putting it up or pulling it down.  Trying out the second one now and will see how it goesl  I was hoping the 'hook' at the top would be more 'stable' but it's pretty flimsy.
B00CRR5L8U|5|Good quality fiel pump
B00IITY2U4|3|I give them three stars based on appearance alone. I specifically asked if drilling was required before I purchased them, and was told no. Drilling was in fact required due to the homemade &#34;bolt plates&#34; that don't fit in the factory holes. I also feel that the mounting brackets are too far apart for an aluminum board. I weight 180 lbs and I don't feel safe or comfortable using them to get in or out of the vehicle, but I trust that they are okay for my small children to use. Once installed, they could be a little shorter in relation to the mud flaps but they look nice. I was also sure that I purchased the correct boards so as to not have any issues, I probably would have retuned them if I didn't throw out the box they came in before I installed them.
B0042XORMI|5|excelente
B0096T8NDW|2|It does what I bought it for (the original one snapped in a car wash, this one doesn't). The range is not very good though!
B001J6CICC|5|It really keeps my face warm from the harsh cold wind when snowboarding especially at night. I also like the looks on people faces when I wear it, I sometimes scare little kids when I snowboard at night
B005XOY072|5|Perfect.
B010TZ90N8|3|Itchy and too big for my 2001 Passat, seats keep sliding around. Not comfortable at all.
B004AGI48K|5|My first disk break job. No complains
B001A4978G|5|so much better than last pump from other company. Has been great so far
B004L5WLZ2|5|Dropped this on the freshly corrected paint of my Crystal Black Silica STi and it added a whole new level of depth to the paint. You can never go wrong with Chemical Guys products.
B000E2CO9Y|5|good
B009XIR2U6|3|Tie rod is slightly too long. Measure the old one!  This product is working, but had to cut almost 1/4 inch off the end.  The tie rod end could have a few more internal threads.  For the money this is a pretty good deal.
B009G4CZOA|5|Great paint, will also look great on my 69 Ford!
B002UC155U|5|Just exactly what I needed to fix the side curtains on my RV (factory left out a bunch of them)
B000NWA8M0|5|easy to replace, works great, saved alot of money by doing it myself...
B00CR91TAW|4|Nice, quick delivery
B0085G9V7E|5|Looks alot better than I expected , bright bright bright
B000F50CQM|5|Excellent tow bar and very good deal.  Really fast shipping.  Tks so much
B002UC4S7M|4|Re making curtains for our motorhome,  and this is perfect for the track that it already in place.
B000BYD4M6|5|This is a fair deal.  The package had been opened, but the blade did not appear to have been installed.  The blade could only be installed on a vehicle with a hooked arm, as there was no set of adaptor pieces, as I am accustomed to seeing.  This is not a problem in my application.
B00KCQSOAA|5|Wonderful seat covers. They didn't fit my 92 cadillac deville like it said they would, but I was able to put them in my brothers geo metro. And they look fantastic in it! I'm very statisfied!
B00AKYP6KU|5|AWSOME  BEAT EBAY  PRICE
B0064TFH1I|5|Perfect for my key ring to glam it up a bit
B000YE8M84|5|This part fit my 2001 Blazer passenger front wheel without any issues. Normally I avoid the parts I could buy at O' Reilly's as I've bad luck with several of their parts failing quickly (so this review might change in the not to distant future), but that this point everything seems to be working smoothly and without any issues.
B00DP518QW|5|I threw these on my 2015 JK 2door. No issues for 10k miles. Since this is a smaller socket than factory, the factory supplied tire rod is to big. These are 17mm bolts so a quick trip to autozone can solve that. They were gloss when recieved in the package and over time they went to a matte black finish. Its not because they are dirty i guess the coating just aged that way.
B004HDY8XQ|5|a great oem product at a fraction of the price available locally.
B00ARUPY04|5|Thank you
B006HY8DC0|5|LOOK SGOOD ON THE BACK WINDOW
B00M4COLY8|5|Love these. I was thinking of putting a hitch on my GLA 250 but decided on a Thule instead and needed mounting points. Great construction and easy to install.
B00LU9ROB8|5|They fit on my dad's '02 FXSTI (Softail Standard) and hold the bags perfectly.  I'd buy them again for that application in a heart beat.
B000C9LVTI|1|This does not fit a Ford F-150 as it is a GM Chevy part
B00E5PK8TE|5|very happy thank you will be buying future batteries there thank you again
B003TQIIPG|4|Took me about 6 hours from start to finish. It looks great. Time will tell how it holds up. **04/21/16 update** The liner still looks great. There are some scratches but nothing that goes through to the original paint. Very durable. I highly recommend this product.
B005JPJMI2|5|greatness
B0048EE1TK|1|Awful product, awful experience.  My best advice is to try ebay.
B00XILM5GK|4|Well worth the price, not ORM quality kinda chincy. Like my wife from 10ft they look awesome! Good Buy
B005DUMUIW|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B003JLCK50|4|too many pockets, not enough space, bag could be a lot wider without compromising he riders space.
B00W67TI9Y|5|Solid product .
B00KQNVD4S|5|Great price and product. Fast shippimg.
B00CITJHJG|5|The mats fit my Tundra Crewmax wonderfully. They cover from edge to edge with the only negative being that you can see scuffs on the mats but it's not that noticeable. Would definitely buy again.
B00IMEZFKQ|4|Fit perfect, quick installation, barely any noise. I have a 2013 Jeep Grand Cheerokee Overland and it was and easy install and it looks great. Yes you can hear a slight wind vibration at high speeds, but it's barely noticeable. The rubber gasket does take a little time to install due to the expansion of the rubber itself, but just a little push and pull as you work your way down and it fit perfect. I'd recommend this product to friends and family.
B0088QEIJW|5|Great service, product better than expected!
B004ZF39ZY|5|They work great
B008PVAEXO|2|Purchased this for Toyota warranty repairs and it doesn't maintain piston ring compression down to the cylinder wall. The steel for the sleeves is too flimsy and flares out at the bottom causing the oil control rings to pop out before they make it in the cylinder. Thank you Amazon for an easy return/refund policy.
B00FB3MT7S|5|Just got it today in the mail and was expecting it Wednesday. It was a great way to end a longgg day and I love it. Looks great and an amazing price.  Thanks guys :)
B00L4NHW7Q|1|A hole worn thru driver mat in two months, less than 3000 mile.
B0002X520S|5|I use this product on all of my leather goods, knife sheaths and especially my boots. This product is recommended by quite a few custom knife sheath makers.
B00FJ5LBOA|1|After 3 months of using it, it stopped working as the first day. It deteriorates after every use.
B00E1SLIDK|5|Good quality at a great price
B011D67O6W|1|Nerf bars mounted nice and easy but the bars them self did not mount flat on mounts so there at a angle mounted on my truck otherwise looks nice and they are sturdy
B00INVEUNQ|5|Thanks
B00LUMBNIA|3|Alot smaller than I thought.  I thought it was regular sized, but it wasn't.  Other than that it reads battery's well
B008Y8M4NQ|2|Very good product, but wrong size
B0007N3JNU|5|A good price. Works just fine. Now I don't even know it's there. And that's the way it should be.
B005N53CBQ|1|Front seat covers will not stay on
B004A30D6O|5|Great
B00666CJ0G|5|Great buy speedy shipping
B009DJVVPM|5|Great price for replacement handle.  It fit just right and was installed in a half an hour or less. So nice to be able to open my tailgate again :)
B00YQXDPO0|5|This is my second DUC.EE unit, also have one on a Multistrada. They do exactly what they say, and they've very small and well-made. With a slip-on exhaust, eliminating the exhaust valve really helped to smooth out the bike's response, and got rid of some really bad popping on deceleration. Not much else to say, but these things are good to go.
B00QMTG1TC|5|fit like it should.
B004OI2AOI|4|It's just crumbled rubber. Hard to make it bad. I don't use it for its intended purpose but it works great for what I use it for.
B000OP6KLY|5|Use in all our vehicles. Great price.
B00NB3T4OG|5|Take the dread out of filling up your mowers i.e. Gas pours fast, really no problem with spills that I can see. You do HAVE to watch and not overfill, or fill to fast. Easy to install (vents)
B003BIVVTC|5|quick and easy
B00RPFWDYO|1|The decal is off-center on the frame. The decal itself is sloppily cut so that it looks ugly from even far away. No workmanship went into the making of this product.
B0081ST4V4|5|worked like a charm on my 2005 mercury mariner stock radio.
B006E8CDCK|5|It has the same finish as the original part and fits great
B00BITIFW2|5|It wasn't as easy as everyone made it out to be to install but once I got it in its been working great.
B00CHSTGKI|5|Fits perfectly on my Subaru, and we were able to get a ladder home safe and soundly on our first try.
B005R4L1N4|5|Worked perfect for my truck came a day early too!
B00IO8J09C|1|Have gap between 2nd row and cover after installation and it is not exact blank color, it is like dark grey color
B008X02J0I|5|There awesome. I had them put in a 98 ford escort. And it's a nice smooth ride. Top notch quality for cheep price.
B001EFP1WC|4|Fits great!
B00K326BY4|5|Awesome bead blaster! Totally worth it.
B00F27R6WG|5|Great cloths, gets the job done well.  Will buy again
B00LG6GIQC|4|Jeep brand floor mats are $75 or more.  These mats were purchased with the intent of saving my new carpets from getting dingy and dirty looking.  They are thick and channeled so wet snow boot water will be trapped and help keep my SUV cleaner.  I wish the rear mats were a little wider to cover more floor area, that would be my only suggest.  Material is thick and heavy and for the price point I'm happy with purchase.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review. I trust that my thoughts in this review will prove helpful in some way - if there are any questions whatsoever, please post them, and I will do my best to answer them based on my personal experience with the particular product.
B000CI6Y32|5|Installed 6 months ago on my 96 saturn SL . just installed one on my 97 saturn SC2 . both still work great and have not had any issues with them. love them. if you own a saturn s-series this is the only known clutch to work flawlessly .and you cant beat the price!
B008I1YM98|3|It worked great and was easy to install, but a required fuse was missing hence the 3 stars.
B008Y37MAQ|4|Fits well and folding makes it easy to store.  Easier than rolling.
B001A5F1YE|1|Water pump broke as soon as it was out of warranty. Cost $300 to get fixed, then broke again after a year. Avoid this piece of junk. I will not buy a whirlpool again
B000CSD39A|5|it filters air neat concept
B000TMMD86|5|Great product Great price and fast shipper
B0009SQL2E|5|Good build quality for the price. Nice color combo too
B000VU9D20|5|good value quick shipping
B00S8A0932|5|Thanks
B00EDFYYV4|5|Definitely something I would buy again.  Fits perfectly for my 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. I believe it had ROC-2 and ROC-3 interchangeable connectors (mine is a ROC-3 connection on the back windshield wiper) so that was a nice to have.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|We received the sunshield we ordered and it arrived in good condition..  It is very lightweight and easy to manage.  Once the visors are down it stays in place nicely.
B00OGGX4XY|5|well build,fit like a glove.
B00YW5QQ0M|3|Looks great
B001EAQTRI|5|The new usb power adapter I installed made a HUGE difference in noise, but this thing killed it completely!  Super simple, in-line installation, build seems solid.  And no perceptible change in sound quality.
B005NP1NI0|1|I first ordered the products for my Chevy Cruze ...front & back floor mats and while the back mats are perfect, the front mats curl away from floor at the sides. Allowing dirt to accumulate. That is minor. WHY I AM GIVING THIS A ONE STAR, I accidentally ordered a Honda mat instead of Cruze Mat. They are CHARGING a 20% restocking fee, instead of exchanging it for me.
B004135NF4|3|Easy install, You can get a cheaper brand that is exactly the same as Dorman. Both made in Tiawan.
B00EWSE5HA|5|prefect fit, easy to install. shipped quickly.
B001DXGH3M|2|1996 F250 Crew Cab.  4X4 7.5 L V8 E4OD Trans.  These headers took a lot of work to get in.  The bolts were very difficult to insert and tighten given the overly tight bend radius on the individual header pipes.  Heddman should offer the 45 degree emissions elbow that needs to be removed from original Ford manifold, as it is impossible to remove from the original manifold and is $100+ from Ford.  The header bolts don't have a lot of engagement and should be 1/4 inch longer.  The hanger on the bend pipe needed to be relocated as it was too long.  I addition to all of the this the Y pipe interferes with transmission bracket...... that had to be removed and rewelded....<br />As for headers, I give them an A.  They sound good, add power, and were a good upgrade.  For installation, I would give Heddman an F, I could not have done this job with out my welder, and it took me 10 hours to get them right.
B0013ERRT4|4|love it
B00OZYHOE2|5|Good qualities and a great seller.
B000CFUFXA|1|It said it would fit, not even close
B008BZS6IY|5|G8 gt seems happy. Just whish the stuff was cheaper.
B0018MITR0|5|raises the back of the aging seat cusion of my 2003 mazda b3000 for more comfort
B0026FCGHC|4|CONS: There are un-ground and unpolished welds on the loop which are cosmetic only but look a little unsightly.  I would imagine it could be a point for rust as it's not painted or coated.<br />PROS: It's solidly built, powder coating on the base is fine. Overall a very well built product.
B0017OALKM|5|No one has rear-ended me yet so they must be working.
B0001CMUV4|5|Wish I bought this years ago! I use it with a hitch mount motorcycle carrier. Keeps it tight.
B000BUU5WW|4|works pretty good, just kind of unnecessary
B005OUWQS0|5|Worked perfectly
B00G2GRY3M|4|come in very handy!!! Not as cheap as others say...
B00IXW0H3W|5|Just as described
B001BWE7BY|5|Perfect. 2nd one that I have purchased. (2nd Boat). Very easy install.
B00KTIVQEW|2|No numbers on the back of the remote, and Amazon was wrong... this does NOT work with 2001 Grand Am's (mine is a 4 cylinder).  Dealer could not program these remotes to work with my car.
B00VJ1D34O|5|This item was great, it met all the specifications, and fit perfect!!!!!!!
B00Z7KIZPA|5|I absolutely love this, my husband has a habit of getting in the car and tossing my purse in the back seat. This really bugs me,so this is the PERFECT answer to my problem.
