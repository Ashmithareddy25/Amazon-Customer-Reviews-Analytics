B007TKT2SK|1.0|I was stupid and didn't notice the app's pictorials clearly lacked a decimal key. I deleted this one right away but it's up there in the cloud reminding me to be more observant next time before I buy an app as appealing as this one promised to be.  Congratulations to all those whom it helps.
B00BSN0K1C|1.0|This borders on false advertising, plain and simple.  There are two photos of the toy prototype used to market this item, but what you receive looks absolutely NOTHING like the photos.  If it did, this would be a great buy for any collector.  Amazon ought to take immediate action to remove the two photos of the toy prototype, because they're deception and misleading to the buyer.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|The story was interesting and moved along at a good pace. I enjoyed the way the characters were developed and presented.

B009MYARIK|3.0|This book achieved what it was marketed for - a beach read, chick lit - but not much more. I will say that it wasn't terribly predictable, which was nice.

B00AF46Q5Y|5.0|This trilogy is excellent; it is hard to put it down.  Although the &#34;F&#34; word was unnecessarily used too much, it was a riveting story.  I can hardly wait for the next one.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was a great coming of age novel. All teens and young adults should read it. It is fantastic

B00915G6WQ|5.0|Dexter just keeps getting better and better and this season is no exception. I blame Dexter for my lack of sleep - it's just too good to stop at one or two episodes per night. I finished the season in 2 days
B0001HLVSC|5.0|Super film, British vs French on the high seas.  Sound effects are extraordinary.  Goes to show that an excellent movie can be made without any vile lanquage, so the kids don't have to cover their ears.  Well done.

B008K8VDPU|5.0|I sing in the choir and sometimes just need to hear my part or the melody separately from the rest of the parts.  This has been a great product.
B00A83075M|5.0|Wreck-It Ralph (2012, rated PG) is a fun adventure movie about how an arcade game villain wants to achieve a hero medal. He doesn't want to \\"go Turbo\\" (renegade and leave his game); he just wants to not be alone and despised anymore. My parents and grade-school niece didn't understand all the gamer references, but the whole family enjoyed the story, music, and artistry. My sister and I enjoyed the Metal Gear, first-person shooter, Kart, and other references. Wreck-It Ralph has strong voice acting and a well-paced storyline that keeps moving. And some of the puns are great. Younger viewers may find the cy-bugs and final boss scary.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved it.  An easy read and both scientific and spiritual inquiry into what happened to the author.  I recommend it.
0618918248|5.0|Let's first state some facts. One fact is that Richard Dawkins is a scientist and not a philosopher. Another fact is that it's evident that his motivation for writing this joke of a book is that he's psychologically motivated to do so. Why? because his basic argument is, \\"If you believe in God, you're an idiot.\\" End of story. The man is not a philosopher, he's a scientist and I'm embarrassed for him as he is making a total donkey of himself.<br /><br />There are so many theologians, philosophers and atheists who have catalogued Dawkin's gross errors, starting with the whole idea that God doesn't exist because scientists have proved it and because Dawkins is a scientist he believes it and you should too.<br /><br />Dawkins has absolutely no interest in debate or discussion as he knows that he would be destroyed in a debate with someone like Craig, Kreeft, D'souza or Alvin Plantinga. A book like this appeals to only those who have no idea what they believe and nominal believers at best. One of the reviews is titled \\"A disallusioned Catholic\\" and states that he became \\"disallusioned\\" at the age of 7 when he was told that his Protestant friend was going to hell.<br /><br />Now if this person had actually taken the time to read either the encyclicals or the catechism they would know that the Catholic Church teaches no such thing. But I make my point. The book appeals to only those who have no idea what on earth they believe.<br /><br />Dawkin's biggest argument against God is that since the universe and the earth are so complex, then that would mean that God is even more complex and since we can't comprehend that or explain it then God doesn't exist. However Dawkins does believe in that we were created by aliens from outer space. So tell me o wise one. God doesn't exist but we are here because little green men transported us to earth on the giant space ark?<br /><br />Again it's evident that many of the \\"new atheists\\" of today are simply people who wear an emotional diaper. Their reason for not believing in God are not based on logic or rationale but on psychology and Dawkin's book proves it as he offers nothing in the way of stimulating thought. It's one thing to read a book by Bertrund Russell or Jean Paul Sartre and be intellectually stimulated but another thing to read the rants of an angry scientist who is mad at God for whatever reason.<br /><br />I can always think of use for a book not matter how bad it is, but I'll have to pass on this one. Get your kitty litter at the pet store and don't waste your time with this garbage.
B000WPAG1Q|5.0|I have always been a big Christina fan but have never had the chance to attend a concert. This is perfect for a fan like me. Great songs, great quality, loved the show!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I found this book to keep your interest in it.Teams was a great man who has given the world so much.And it's sad that  in the USA our own schools don't teach more information about him.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have read MANY of Sivia Days books. And I liked them all. The Bared To You Series hands down were the best. Except for this one. I'm so surprised at this book. I waited patiently for this book. Reflected was sooo good, it left you hanging, wondering what was going to happen next. And we find out exactly whats next. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Really, the only positive I can say about this book is their build up of trust. Eva wasn't annoyingly possessive and JEOLOUS like in the other books. When she felt that urge to jump into conclusions and run, she'd stop to think it over. Finally realizing that Gideon killed for her. He had no desire to be with anyone else. But there were too many incidents of that in the book. And then there's Brett, I too agree with the other readers. If Eva loved Gideon so much, she wouldn't have any type of a problem telling him to back off. Brett tells her his intentions are to,\\"be inside her,\\" again. So why is it so important to have him as a friend? I don't like it. Gideon gets to me a little as well with Corrine. He wants nothing to do with her and she's obsessing over him. And he goes to her when his mom tells him she's in the hospital. Like Corrine is Eva. Eva goes along with but then he sends her away. REALLY? Besides all of this, this book was EXTREMELY DISSAPOIINING. I too was under the impression that this was to be a three part series. I too feel that Ms. Day is thinking of the CHA-CHING! But I tell you what, if, \\"Entwined to You,\\" was anywhere near as good as the other two. If it ended like, Reflected, I wouldn't hesitate to pre-order book 4. Instead, I'm left not knowing how I should feel about this book. It's truly a shame because Gideon is a great leading man. He's the only leading man I felt could even walk in Christian Gray' s shoes. But, if you still want to give this book a try, Gideon will not disappoint. He is still, bad storyline and all, \\"THE MAN.\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very very fun and exciting game and love the new outfits and the flamingos are a great idea on your part
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun kids game. It is a fun game to play when you are bored or just when you are tired and you are laying in bed. If your wondering if you should install this game don't think twice just get it. By the way it's FREE!!!!

193700788X|5.0|I think this book was as good as any of the others.  If I had been looking for literature (say that with an English accent) then I wouldn't have read any.  The Sookie books are just for fun and provided hours of entertainment.  I will miss Sookie.

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|My husband uses this all the time.  He has the original HP12C Financial Calculator, has had it for at least 30 years.  This model is more powerful and has some additional capabilities that he appreciates.  The old one still works, but he is glad he upgraded to the Platinum model.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|We watched this on NetFlix, which does not enable viewer reviews. I wrote the following for a friend of mine who counts on me to recommend movies.<br /><br />\\"Tonight we finished watching Django Unchanged (silent D) on DVD from NetFlix. Originally a pretty exciting movie...had us on the edge of our seat at first. It degenerated into a cartoon version of the antebellum south, with blood spatters like they came from a fire hose, with all blacks good, all whites degenerate sadists.\\"<br /><br />I will add if this movie depicted all whites good, all blacks degenerate sadists, it would have been denounced as blatant racism by the news media and talk shows for weeks, with cries for more laws to prevent other films like this from being made. How did we get on this one-way street, anyway? Martin Luther King said in 1963, \\"I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood.\\"<br /><br />A good starting point nowadays to realize King's dream is to recognize that racism is a two way street, and not a means to a political goal.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|Poland's Riverside's latest offering is another melodic romp through modern heavy progressive rock, sometimes bordering on metal.  Actually the metal element is largely missing from this one until you get towards the end of the album with the tracks \\"Deprived\\" and \\"Escalator Shrine\\" which have sections that rock out pretty heavily.  The first half of the album is quite mellow and atmospheric a style which Riverside has learned to do very well.  The album is somewhat of a departure from what they have done before, but I don't think it is enough that older fans should be scared off.  The fact that these guys continue to develop and work with new sounds and textures should be a favorable sign of more great things to come in the future.  Riverside always set the bar high and this album is no exception.  It is different, but I think as good if not better than much of their previous catalogue.
B000FC0OOU|1.0|self-indulgetnt, adolescent male shines through.  Repetitive, incessant foul language, and no basic explanation of the draw of the Spanish Civil war on its foreign participants.
B008S80OU2|5.0|This collection is a veritable wet dream for fans of one of the most underappreciated bands in rock n roll history, Blue Oyster Cult.  All of the Columbia albums are represented here in their entirety.  The collection also includes a rarities disc, a disc of cuts from various live radio broadcasts, an expanded version of the live album \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", and a DVD from that same tour.  Everything is re-mastered and sounds pristine.  The re-mastering especially enhances the classic live album \\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\" which always sounded really muddy in it's original incarnation and their second to last studio album for Columbia \\"Club Ninja\\".  Everything you could ever want from B.O.C. is here with the exception of their 3 most recent albums; \\"Heaven Forbid\\", \\"Curse Of The Hidden Mirror\\", and the live \\"A Long Days Night\\".  This collection is also bargain priced considering the incredible amount of music that you get.  This band was so influential on so many bands that came after them, but they rarely seem to get a lot of credit.  The lyrics were twisted, the music jamming and with 4 vocalists there was always a lot of variety to be found.  Buck Dharma is one of the most underappreciated guitarists of his era as evidenced by the discs in this collection (especially the live ones).  The \\"Rarities\\" and \\"Radio Broadcasts\\" CD's contain some real gems, especially some of the more obscure live stuff from \\"Mirrors\\", like \\"The Vigil\\", \\"Great Sun Jester\\", and the title track.  The \\"Teachers\\" movie soundtrack stuff is just ok IMO.  Blue Oyster Cult is still a living, breathing touring machine today in 2013 although sadly have not put out any new music in over a decade.  This collection should satisfy the most ardent B.O.C. fan as well as serve as a great introduction for beginners.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.
B00CW665VI|4.0|This story was very good.  Pretty funny at times too.  Took a while to get used to Drew talking the reader through his feelings and point of view but worth the read.
B002SRQ214|5.0|this cpu is more compatible with my games than the old FX chip.  i was finally able to play Crysis and Crysis Warhead without a hitch.  it's not as fast, but i bought it mostly for the compatibility of my games.  combined with my Sapphire Radeon 7770 HD GHZ OC, i got very nice performance regardless of video settings.  i highly recommend this for any game and application =)
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Simple concept, yet challenging puzzles. It is five stars. There is a free version available, highest not HD.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is maybe the best app ever. I love the scenery and different challenges. It definitely beats temple run 1.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|Who knew that Hugh Laurie was such a multi-talented and multi-faceted individual! He doesn't have the depth of vocals that classic black blues singers had, but he has a passion and a voice as good as many other white blues singers! No reason why he shouldn't sing the blues too!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|subway surfers is really fun. I would recommend this app because you can unlock a bunch of different characters and there's missions you can complete for extra coins.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Love anything with Anthony Hopkins, also like Helen Mirren. Moved a little slow. Funny how he seemed to have crush on all his leading ladies, but admired from afar.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|This series is similar to the Hunger Game series. I have read the first two and enjoyed them very much. I am looking forward to reading the last one.
B007FXLZ9K|4.0|Michael Fassbender, need I say more. He is so sexy, who new. He was beautifully vulnerable in this film and Carey Mulligan wow.<br />Everything i see her in, i like her more and more. Very good actress.
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|So, asbestos armor on, and into the breach... *SPOILERS AHEAD*<br /><br />I don't share a lot of others' objections to this movie. Yes, the characters are somewhat different - they are different actors. And sure, the movie differed from whatever TOS or TNG or whatever episode or movie any individual viewer may find best - but those episodes and movies differed a lot from each other. And yes, some of the dynamics changed, but as others have pointed out, it's a parallel universe changed by altering the timeline.<br /><br />But... What bothers me is the laziness. The changed timeline excuses almost anything, but what it can't excuse is fundamental changes in someone who went into cryosleep a century before the timeline was changed. Why does Khan look so very different? Why is he an order of magnitude stronger? Why does he have miraculous healing abilities?<br /><br />And what kills me is this could all have been addressed with a few lines of exposition. How about this:<br />Spock: &#34;There is no record of him existing until a year ago. And yet, one of the earliest records we have is of cosmetic surgery to alter his appearance. Why change the appearance of someone with no records in the first place?&#34; Because that someone is an infamous, exiled war criminal, of course. This could start the audience really wondering, &#34;Who is this guy?&#34;<br /><br />Then change the order of some of the exposition, so the Admiral does a bit of a reveal of Harrison's nature before they confront Khan on Kronos: &#34;We're outclassed as a species. The Romulans, the Klingons, they're warrior races. So... we experimented. A bioenhancement. It made the recipients smarter, stronger... Much smarter. Much stronger. Able to heal from almost any injury. Immune to disease. But the test subjects couldn't take it. So many of them died. The strongest, the ones with the most willpower, went insane or their bodies went haywire. We needed a stronger host. And we found them. We found the records of a an old sleeper ship, where they exiled the last tyrants of the Eugenics Wars. We found them, gave them the serum - and it worked! By God, it worked! Better than we could ever have hoped!&#34;<br /><br />Now you've got the audience who remembers Space Seed going &#34;Cr@p, Khan is back and now he's stronger and smarter and invulnerable?!&#34;<br /><br />And you've explained the change in appearance and abilities, and why he's more psychotic, and the &#34;magic blood,&#34; all thanks to thirty seconds of additional dialogue.<br /><br />If you want to be a little more ambitious, add a couple of scenes:<br /><br />Khan as a prisoner tempts Kirk. &#34;Imagine, Captain. We few, we perfect specimens, we can transcend mortality.&#34; [Looks at Kirk appraisingly] &#34;You could survive the serum, I think, Captain. You could be one of the elect.&#34; Throw in a little morality play, the essence of humanity, morality of biotech, etc.<br /><br />At the end, have McCoy tell Kirk they filtered all the serum out of him. Then cut to a scene with a couple of Federation scientists. &#34;He tolerated the serum amazingly well.&#34; &#34;Yes. Fascinating.&#34; (I'm thinking the second scientist is Vulcan.) Pan to a fetus in a canister of liquid with a label reading, &#34;Kirk, James Tiberius.&#34;  Fade out. When the movie series starts to flag, trot out a superhuman &#34;Tiberius Kirk&#34; villain as an homage to the &#34;evil Kirk&#34; TOS episodes.<br /><br />So that's about two minutes of additional easy footage.<br /><br />If you want to be more ambitious, change the opening sequence on the alien planet to a planet where the Admiral and his co-conspirators have been abandoning the insane, twisted survivors of the initial serum experiments. Maybe the volcano was artificially induced when the conspirators decided to eliminate the evidence after Khan went rogue. Maybe the crackdown on Kirk for violating the Prime Directive is really driven by paranoia that he interfered with and almost discovered the cover-up.<br /><br />Obviously that's just an example of a slightly different way to go, but it feels like it would have been so easy to fix the continuity issues that Abrams wasn't even trying. Instead, we get throw-away references to TOS - tribbles, Gorns, and of course &#34;KHAAAAAN!&#34; I'm sorry, and I know I'm in the minority, but it just feels lazy, and to be honest, that really bugs me.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Always loved her. She is histeracal in this. What a sense of humor she has and she enjoys life. Thanks.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I'm okay with the story not ending yet but really?!?!  Talk about just stopping.  It seemed that it just lost steam. There are too many loose ends and no direction. It seemed that a deadline had to be reached and that was just as far as she could get by then. We still don't know much more of Gideon's story. I have been waiting for  this and it was kind of a let down.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I love this book so much. But why did Ridley have to lose her powers. Other than that it was great.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This review is probably unnecessary, because everyone is well aware of angry birds and what it is.  IF you don't know its a puzzle game that tosses birds at pigs to destroy them for points.  It will burn hours of your time and entertain you.  Great app for waiting in lines and killing time.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The new charger did work but did not resolve the problem. even though i can charge my kindle i have to prop it up a certain way for the red light to come on and stay on to start charging, and sometimes i charge overnight and the light is still red.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I needed a notepad app and it works.  There are probably better and worse apps.  This one is fine for me
B005HSL626|5.0|loved it<br />it made me addicted the first time i played it . I had so much fun and will recomend it to anyone.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|I like it but its kind of irritating that for just about every game you need to spend a while on forums trying to figure out how to run it effectively.  If they added a trial version feature of the games I would probably buy a lot more games.  I hate buying games and end up hating them :-/
B0085YOD1A|3.0|The main thing that I liked about it was that it said the percentage was but not worth &cent;99 not worth it
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I love this movie, and the songs are incredibly  catchy.  Well done rendition, and if you enjoy musicals you'll enjoy it.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Quite an informative book! Thank you Sylvia for sharing your wealth of knowledge with those of us with a desire to delve into the world Aquaponics.
B005CRQ2IU|2.0|I read this book on Kindle which was great.  The graphics on my Kindle Fire and my iPad were quite nice.  I just didn't get engaged in the story and found it cold and distant.  Without a character I really enjoyed, the book was hard going for me.  Still I am glad to have experience with a graphic novel in the ebook form.  My gut feeling is that this novel and others like it are geared for male audiences.  As a kid I loved superheroes but went for Supergirl, Lois Lane, and sometimes Wonder Woman.  Male superheroes always left me cold.
1781162646|3.0|This is not a negative review, and overall, I enjoyed this fairly quick story. The price - just $7.21 as of this writing - is a bargain, and going straight to paperback makes it a convenient and simple summer read to carry around.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book is just 'okay' - which means three stars - to me. I don't think it was that memorable, and my memories of it will quickly fade.<br /><br />It's not the story itself that's the problem. The scene of an amusement park with a dark past is a surprisingly underused setting in thriller fiction, and the overall details and description give 'Joyland' a realistic portrayal on the page.<br /><br />The protagonist is an appropriately nostalgic 60-something telling the story of his summer at the park when he was 21, and recently broken-hearted from an ill-fated college love (I went to University of New Hampshire, and it was funny to see Hamilton Smith Hall get a shout-out). His friends and fellow carnival employees are lively and unique characters - on the surface.<br /><br />What was missing for me, and why this book is only three stars, is the \\"life\\" of the characters beyond those basics. And I realized, reading \\"Joyland,\\" that this has been missing for me from King's last few books - I've been entertained, and compared to other thrillers he's almost always superior even on an off day - but I end them feeling sort of flat. I don't expect him to recapture the amazing magic of \\"Salem's Lot\\" or \\"Night Shift,\\" but I wondered why they weren't even close.<br /><br />The problem I think, is that 30 years ago, when King was writing his classic books - \\"The Stand,\\" \\"The Shining,\\" \\"Cujo\\" - he could have real, normal conversations with people as himself. Like going to the store and chatting up the counter guy. He could mine those interactions for the nuggets and details that made his fiction so incredibly good - the characters from \\"The Stand\\" are some of the most full-life in all of literature. It wasn't that he was basing characters on real people but that he knew how 'real' people actually talked. He wasn't in the cocoon of being a multi-millionaire superstar - but how can he have a conversation now? As soon as he enters a room, he IS the room. Even doing his research, I'm sure it's friendly and informal, but it can't possibly be an organic dialogue between two equals.<br /><br />I reported from Iraq as an embedded journalist - the soldiers could (EDIT: NOT) have cared less that I was a reporter. I was just a guy with a notebook in my hand, and while the conversations weren't exactly normal, we were on equal footing. But I've also seen how soldiers reacted to big-time celebrity journalists with TV cameras and production crews - nobody's honest anymore. They talk in soundbites and statements, and wait for the next question to direct them. It loses the organic flow.<br /><br />So to me, the lacking ingredient in his recent books is the dialogue and how the characters interact - it doesn't feel real. The interactions move the plot along, but they rarely feel like honest people talking. They read like the first draft of a conversation but lack the subtleties and personality of real people. King tries - lines like \\"Me n Erin\\" or \\"s'pose\\" try to stand in for accents, but it feels contrived, and it's not consistent. It's almost like a beginning writer who thinks \\"well, I guess this is how people talk.\\"<br /><br />That doesn't mean the plot isn't interesting, but I don't invest with the characters because they never come to life.<br /><br />I could be totally wrong, of course, and maybe his celebrity hasn't changed him or his interactions in any way - but I feel something's missing from his characters, and that's what I think the problem is.<br /><br />Without that ability to connect with daily living, his books become ALL imagination, but they lack the down-and-dirty human touch his earlier books relied on. So \\"Joyland\\" is still an interesting and fun story to read, but there's an emptiness, the origins of which I've only now identified, at least from my perspective.<br /><br />So three stars means it's 'okay.' Not a bad book, or weak story - just an acknowledgement that we can't go back to what things used to be.he origins of which I've only now identified, at least from my perspective.<br /><br />So three stars means it's 'okay.'

B00C90T4QK|4.0|Love the whole album, different songs then what is on the everyday radio, I enjoy it. Would def required it to a friend
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|A blatant attempt to milk her audience for more cash. Who spend $40 on 4 books hat should have really been 2?
B000E5N684|5.0|WOW = unrated Triple X in my opinion. I would think if this movie was shown in theaters as it is on this divd, unrated director cut, it would have been raided. Just joking sort off. Michacel Douglas and Sharon Stone &#34;getting it on&#34; in full monty. I enjoyed it. It is a thriller in more ways than one. But NOT FOR KIDS..<br /><br />A real murder mystery. Who done it? Not for the faint of heart.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry Bosch lives to fight for the right another day, and does it quite nicely in this newest book.  Connelly takes him further than  some authors might by bringing two complicated cases to a satisfying conclusion. Harry shows significant emotional growth and a willingness to take risks with his heart that hasn't been as evident in prior novels. I also enjoyed seeing how his relationship with his daughter is becoming deeper, with an emphasis on forming her to live the life she wants as opposed to the life he would choose for her.  Through some intense episodes involving his cases and his personal life, Harry reveals a willingness to forgive, perhaps one of the hardest things we humans have to do.  The villains are vile and not always who they might seem. The two cases are complete and challenging,  with subtle clues that would probably be missed by a less experienced detective.  I read this book in two sittings on the same day, and would have read it straight through except duty called.  Enjoyable, not too challenging,  and this book sets Harry up for five more years on the force.  More good reads coming.  I save five stars for the best of the best.  I would, if I could, give The Black Box 4.5 out of 5 stars.  Very enjoyable.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gideon and Eva's journey continues in Entwined with more passion and depth to their relationship building.  Still more twists and turns pulling them apart and them still battling through.  I was really sad coming to the end of the book, but SO glad to find out another book is coming out that will continue this awesome story and series!!!  I love that these characters have to work through so much as the story develops and things don't easily fall into their laps.  Love love love this series!!  Now I just hope the wait is not too long for the next book!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's a great book but be prepared to have your psyche tossed and turned, page by page.  I don't think of myself as a masochist but I enjoyed every twist of the author's plot.  I think you will too.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|My only complaint was that it ended to soon. I appreciated how this story tied up loose ends,some that I didn't know were there.
B00AIBZM40|4.0|Interesting film in that it keeps you interested the whole way through, the ending is a little bit mmmm, but at least it has a ending. Only afterwards you get the grasp of why it ended as it does, but still a conclusive film that is entertaining with a few eye closing moments  thrown in.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|A good a sliding block style game with entertaining graphics.  Takes an age old genre and executes it very well.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Only one problem with the film, it ends too soon. Fast and colorful and action and everything thrown into the mix, to leave you wanting more and more. So get the dvds over the next three years and watch it one time to enjoy it fully. Great clean fun for the whole family.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|You don't just do missions.,you explore new-York like the classics. You can find a crime going on all over  New  York in  the game
B00846REIS|5.0|I like the story of this book. The story about Gideon and Eva. And can't wait for the next story to begin.
0679805273|1.0|I bought this book for my daughters preschool graduation.  I had family members write messages in it to give to her at her high school graduation.  Unfortunately,  after the family did it, I noticed my &#34;new&#34; book, wasn't in fact new.  On the last page was a message to someone else that had been in there when I bought it.  I didn't even think to look through the entire book since it appeared new.  Now I'm trying to figure out what to do to cover the unwanted message up.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really loved this book. It's a really great story about Gideon and Eva. And i can't wait what happens next in the next story.
0385344228|5.0|Finished \\"Defending Jacob,\\" yesterday. All I can say is Wow. Can't stop thinking about the book. \\"SPOIILER.\\" I really thought there was a chance that Jacob didn't kill Ben. That he really tried to help him. But then much later when they go on vacation and Hope dies I'm thinking this kid is a killer. Why did he kill Hope? I was so sad. Then Laurie decides to kill herself and Jacob but ends up living. I tried to put myself in her shoes and I could totally understand why she did that. She couldn't let Jacob kill another innocent person. So is it nature or nurture? Can you have a murder gene? I think it's possible. I wish that the writer had told us what happened to Laurie and Andy. I imagine that they could never recover from what Laurie did. My mind is still reeling. I'd rate the book 10 stars if I could. I'll go with 5 stars.<br /><br />Mary
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Finally Gideon and Eva are going to get what they want if they can't survive their past secrets and start a life together.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|fun.wish it was easier to get better cards, but all in all a great game.  I recommend it. just don't pillage me.
0345529057|5.0|This a great collection of books at a reasonable price. Though Martin took a strange angle when writing &#34;A Feast for Crows,&#34; the entire series is a wonderful read! And the price is just as great. Highly recommend this series to anyone.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Okay, I started this game in July or Aug of 2012, since then, they've done updates for the other platforms several times.  My neighbors get all this neat new stuff.  And of course, they make me wait to start while they notify me with pop ups of all the new stuff I CAN'T DO!  Irritating.  Then, I post on the Team Lava page that Kindle users should boycott until they update OUR platform, AND THEY CENSORED the word BOYCOTT, then THEY DELETED MY POST!  I've gone from irritate to majorly offended and ticked off.<br />If they didn't want to support the kindle platform, they shouldn't have released one.  They have all kinds of excuses about how difficult Amazon is to get update approvals through, but Tiny Co doesn't seem to have a problem (Perhaps because they're actually TRYING).  Officially dropping this game from my play list.  This company DOESN'T play fair with updates, and they don't show any intention to start.
B009NY43NY|4.0|As the end of the Sookie Stackhouse series, a lot of loose ends had to be resolved.  Harris really tried to include all the old characters in the story.  It was done well but there were so many issues, it was done hurriedly.  I'm sure many were disappointed in the ultimate resolution of all.  Would Sookie end up with Eric?  Or Bill?  Or one of the other men in her life?  There was really only one logical choice and Harris made it a romantic choice for our favorite supe-loving heroine.  I would have loved to give the finale 5 stars.  It was just hard to love the end of one of my favorite series.  I love Charlaine Harris no matter what and she has written several other series that I highly recommend for those who need a fix of her writing.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|The movie was funny  and dealt with sexual themes that made me uncomfortable at times. It seemed to make people more familiar with different life styles so you will accept them. I felt like I was spoon fed to see wrong as right and the way to go. No morals~everything was OK in this production. Went against my core values.
B00C1BHQXK|3.0|Self-help book, easy to read, based on personal experience; funny and witty, nice read. As with all self-help books, it's still up to the reader to understand the main points, learn them, integrate them and pick up the sweet fruits of success.<br />Good tips, still nothing you haven't read before in similar recent books; just in a different 'mix'. Professionals will most likely resonate and agree with few ideas, like multitasking is not great at all, willpower is depletable and you have to rejuvenate it all the time (just like &#34;Thinking, Fast And Slow&#34; says), and a balanced life all the time is not ... well, possible.<br />It's all about Focus, Focus, Focus!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I had never read any book on out of body experience. In that sense, this was my first experience reading something related to 'life' beyond death.<br />What sets this book apart is the fact that it is written by a neurosurgeon. Medicos, in general know more than us average people about life. But the author has gone beyond life, transgressing the boundaries which most never cross. His 'experiences' in the world beyond are not only interesting but also informative. The information contained in the book significantly reduced my fear of death!<br />Most importantly, it is a book that you can trust. A highly readable and credible account of out of body experience. Those who are skeptical about the very existence of God, should make it a point to read this book.
B0045ODPKY|5.0|I knew what it was and it did not disappoint !!! Angelina was great and it showed the potential<br />corruption of our government!!!
0143120530|5.0|Bought this book after attending a &#34;conversation with...&#34; evening where the author was one of two panelists.  He was a charming, dynamic and interesting presenter.<br />The book is a fast, easy, enjoyable read and combines huge amounts of assorted information and knowledge into one place -- the book.  That is at the same time a plus and a minus.  While much of the background information is necessary and interesting, I personally found it to be a bit much. Sometimes it seemed a little repetitious.  I would have liked to read more about the author.  Of course, I realize that without most of the background information and explanations, the book might not have been long enough. -:)<br />I recommend this book highly.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I was really wanting to enjoy this film. I love stories about witches. I have never read the books, but after seeing this film, I can tell that the movie is portraying them poorly. The love story is rushed at best, the acting is over the top and the lines delivered are atrocious.<br /><br />The main female character is unlikable in this film, and the leading male seems obsessed and masochistic. Side characters are cheesy, delivering corny lines in melodramatic ways. The actors themselves are good actors, but the roles and lines they are given are so terrible it is hard for them to shine in this film.<br /><br />Despite the good reviews here by some people on amazon, the bad marginally out weighs it. This film did not do well at the box office and I completely see why. If you are hoping for \\"Twilight\\", this movie is not it, if you are hoping for \\"The Craft\\", this film is not it. If I were an author and saw my book being portrayed this way I'd wish I'd never sold the movie rights.<br /><br />Beautiful Creatures just ends up being a Beautiful Mess.
B00008F2LT|5.0|Considered one of Creedence's best albums. Vinyl from this period is hit or miss when it comes to warps. This one was mint.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I've noticed a pattern with the bad reviews on this film.<br /><br />Zombie fanatics were frustrated with it because it's not really a zombie film, and those who expected a comedy were frustrated because it wasn't funny. Warm Bodies is neither of these things.<br /><br />Just like Funny Farm is a satire, so is this film. It's basically as other reviewers have mentioned, a love story, symbolizing that how we feel and treat each other has the power to revive. It's a cute, simple message just told through a zombie metaphor. If you understand that the film is symbolic, and a love story you analyze it less and enjoy it more.<br /><br />If you are a die-hard zombie fan, this film is not for you. If you are looking for a comedy like Shaun of the Dead, this is definitely the wrong movie for you. If you are looking for a cute story with this dark sort of twist and a sprinkle of humor dashed on it, you will find this film entertaining.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The book is ponderous!  Having failed twice before getting through the whole thing, I'm taking it a section at a time, stopping to read other things for a while.  I've found I'm getting more out of it and enjoying it more.  Be patient with it!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I didn't know what to expect but the characters are wonderful, the story (although horrid in some ways) is heart warming and really interesting. I enjoyed it a lot.
159463176X|3.0|Having read all three Hosseini books, I eagerly awaited this one. Each told a different kind of story. The beginning of this one captured me with the tale of the div, something I had never before heard. Then came the sad story of siblings Abdullah and Pari, which took my breath away.  As time went on and the story progressed from the early 1950s to the twenty-first century, I longed for some continuity between their stories and those of their families.  Instead, the book concentrated too much on other characters.  I realize many events went in different directions, but there was too much information about minor characters and a need for a more streamlined story about the main characters. Another good read from Hosseini, but a little disappointing.
0679722610|5.0|With all respect to The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice this is (at least in my opinion) the best and most important work to come out of American Noir. Gritty, terse, violent and bereft of any simply White-Hat good guys, Hammett distills a the genre down to it's core, and yet he does so without sacrificing anything in terms of narrative or character. While certainly not a pretty or particularly happy novel, Hammett never lets the text get away from him, producing a work that is engaging and easy to read. Above and beyond that, Red Harvest tells a truly original story, to be clear the story itself is new, not just the framing or usages of literary device. There is a reason two of the greatest movies, Yojimbo and A Fistful of Dollars, are based off this novel.<br /><br />All in all, an American masterpiece and a must read for anyone that is comfortable with stories that aren't pretty.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|love the trek serieis .WOW nine more words need or required to submit this review plus three and three more words, no the reviewers will probably  send this back because it has negative unrelated and UN- responsive text.. Attempted to respond to a seller in his native tongue and the entire review was rejected .  Amazon thought i was using profanity. Change the guidelines, sometime we the consumer do NOT what to consider why we purchased something, what the weather was like or weather or not the world events influenced our decision to make the purchase. WOW what a rant..................SORRY, Its Friday and I need to be out side.  Live long and ...............you know.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is the game that I have been waiting for to play.. I wish I had time and the money to play all the time.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this app It is easier to play than using a laptop, it seems that it is easier to get better scores
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Fascinating to see views of American culture from a foreigner.  Smooth prose. A novel that captured my interest from page 1.  Ending predictable, but not disappointing. If you haven't read her earlier book,  Half a Yellow Sun, do so. It is outstanding.
076535618X|5.0|Again Scalzi has produced a great read, returning to characters who are believable and entertaining.  Nothing is happening for the reasons it seems and the semi-omnipotent narrator (John Perry) walks us through the whys. Lots of political action and a sprinkling of physical action that is reminiscent of Heinlein (with a different political view).<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that most of the main characters are sarcastic throughout this novel.  I love sarcasm, I use it often, but it led to little diversity in speech pattern amongst the main characters (Jane being an exception).
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I seriously thought this would be the conclusion of the three books, but no the reader has to wait for another book.  I don't think I will spend another $9.99 on the fourth installment.  Truly disappointed.
B008XKT9FG|4.0|This is a well done story.  The. characters  are well played and the plot is super. Helen Hunt is a geat mature actress.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|I have always enjoyed Nat King Cole and George Benson's music. This seems to be Benson's best yet. Menzel and Hill's duets with Benson  are great on this tribute. I played it for my elementary age students and they loved it. It is funny how all generations are enjoying Nat King Cole's music.  The combination of Benson's  voice (and his guitar) and the Henry Mancini Institute orchestra (flute and violin solos) in Nature Boy were incredible. The arrangements of Randy Waldman got the best out of everyone. It is just so relaxing. I already bought some for gifts-
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good easy read- entertaining, not deep- but fun science fiction story. The review said I needed more words so here they are.
B008476HBM|5.0|I read this at least once a year.  This e-book was flawless and free-how can you go wrong with that?

B00992CF6W|4.0|I bought for a long car ride but since im used to the pc it needs WAY more work to please me again
1250012570|5.0|I fell in love with this book within the first few pages. The characters are flawed and real and honest and true and every other good thing that turns a character into a real person. Because Eleanor and Park feel real. Eleanor comes from a pretty broken family, and her struggles to be a normal teenager pull at your heart. Park is adorable and so kind, and together the two are constantly cracking jokes and tossing around witty comments. Both of them frustrate you and make you laugh and are extremely accurate depictions of the complexity that is teenage life.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park deals with a lot of issues that kids face daily, even though it's set in the mid-1980s. Family issues, making friends, bullying, love, learning to drive - this book totally encompasses what it's like to be a teenager and all the challenges being a teen brings with it. Even if you haven't experienced all of the same problems the characters face, it's still easy to relate to their troubles and feel for them.<br /><br />One of my favorite things was Rowell's writing style. It is flawless. Every sentence reads like it effortlessly flowed from her fingers and out onto the page. Everything feels natural and real and ephemeral and clean. There aren't any excessive descriptions or overly-ridiculous moments, which I really appreciated. Instead, this book felt honest and wonderful and I loved every word of it.<br /><br />This is probably the craziest thing I'll write on here, but reading this book made me feel weightless. I don't know if that even makes sense to other people, but it was the kind of book that challenges you and makes you fall in love and breaks your heart and cracks you up all at the same time.<br /><br />Fans of John Green definitely need to check this one out. Rowell's style is incredibly similar, and I promise that if you love Green's work, you'll love Eleanor & Park. I can't think of a single person who wouldn't enjoy this lovely novel. It crosses gender lines and age lines and has absolutely no barriers. No matter who you are or what you like to read, do yourself a favor and go pick this one up. You'll thank me later.<br /><br />Read more reviews at http://abbiereadsbooks.blogspot.comhas absolutely no barriers.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Hope the writers keep it interesting and intense. i think the last episode has me a little worried that the show may become too soft and lose my interest.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is excellent for the fire and provides lots of information. It will give you good information as to the status of the battery for the kindle fire. It loads quickly and moves between information screens quickly too. It isn't an annoying app that keeps popping up alerts when you don't want them and it doesn't seem to eat up any additional memory thus slowing down other apps.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I bought this lovely film not only for digital copy so i can watch anywhere at any time of the day but also due to the fact that the film has impact my life and many others as well.For it impact me from my times going thorough middle school and knowing exactly how Charlie felt through the beginning of the film.Even though those were rough parts of my life i had hope because in the back of my mind i know that it would only be like this for a couple of years until i could finally get out of each school year until graduation comes.SO enough about my life.To me i believe once you see this heart touching movie it might become one of your top 5 movies or at least top 10.It certainly was Top 5 for me and  males opinion.Also not only are their beautiful scenes in it but you also go through what the main character freshman Charlie experiences and went through.So i say buy it you wont regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I got it and went through it in one night a very enjoyable game and I am looking forward to the next step in the saga of the game. Keep up the good work.
B00992CF6W|1.0|It is fun but it has a lot of bugs since the update like you can't take armour off once you put it on.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Lots of fun and I like the way that you can get gold and can level up pretty fast. I wish that there were more acorns to pop out. When visiting with your friends you get hearts; you can buy stuff. This game is cool and great for all ages......
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I have read many, many history books, fact and fiction. The majority dealing with aviation, especially military aviation. This story from the Second World War is one of the best. One could easily mistake it for a book of historical fiction, due to the unbelievable events within, but it is fact. It looks at the &#34; other side&#34; of the war, the German experience, and probably would not have found a publisher before the turn of the new century, let alone an author to put it into text. But the results of events in just the past thirteen years brought an young author to tell the story beautifully and a publisher who felt it was worthy of printing. I won't go into the story any more than to say that two warrior brothers from different nations found each other in the most incredible of places, times and circumstances. The reader will not be disappointed, and will be moved beyond any simple words here can describe. HBO, Mr. Spielberg, and Mr. Hanks; please take note. This story is as important to share visually as was &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; and &#34;Pacific&#34; !
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is wonderful i love everything in it, its fun and i know tons love it keep it  up notch
B00309DC1M|1.0|The movie will stop at one spot and freeze. The only way I can get it going again is to stop it and then start it up at the next scene. It is really annoying.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is amazing. It tells you the temperature  of your Phone. It shows you how long it would take for your phone to die, and helps charge your phone faster. Get this app!
B00355L2TU|5.0|I love it and i love her!! She's so inspiring and this program is fantastic!! Its a little difficult at first if you're a little out of shape but totally worth it
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was a pretty good book. Great for a quick read. Only took me about half and hour. Would recommend it to anyone who likes this series.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app, you can text friends easily an  send pictures and make faces at each other. My brother and sister loves using this app so they can text their friends an  I have to say that they should not get rid o  thus app at all.

B008Y2VTIS|4.0|Saw the first season on DVD. It's pretty good. LIke all serials, they hook you in even if it's mediocre. But the sets and attention to detail on costumes and the period look is pretty cool. The older viewers of us will get a lot of &#34;Oh, wow. I remember those things.&#34; It's pretty violent at times and boring at others. Over all worth a try at least. Still better than most shows produced for tv.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|It keeps you on edge and it's not overly dramatic. Feels real and perhaps that's what's scary about it. I recommend it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Better than the HELP which I loved.  The characters came alive- very bittersweet but real in the characterizations and the storyline.  I found that I couldn't put it down- it was so compelling.  Would make a good book for a book club- lends itself to interesting discussion.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love it.  Many different lay outs and many levels.  It is agreat game that tests your skill and speed.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I have played approximately 1/3 of the game; I am totally satisfied.  The story is a bit forced, but I consider it only a frame  for the scenes and the objects placed within them.  The graphical quality is quite good, at least on the Kindle Fire HD7&quot; and 8.9&quot; displays.  The objects to be found are usually shown as white silhouettes; the shape might be a mirror image of the actual object.  At other times the list is presented in word form.  And there are a few related puzzles for variety.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|The movie was just OK.  In fact I believe that I fell asleep at some point before it ended.  Watching once was enough.
B000089RVX|4.0|Nice CD!  Mostly metal but tracks vary in style very nicely. Whoever produced this baby is close to a genius -- really well done.  And she's a great singer!  Lyrics a little on the downer side, but the overall quality of the music/vocals/production values certainly compensate for that.  Highly recommended.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|The movie was just OK.  In fact I believe that I fell asleep at some point before it ended.  Watching once was enough.

B00BF123WG|5.0|The movie was just excellent.  In fact I did not fall asleep at any time before it ended.  This movie is worth watching again.
B009R659L8|5.0|I haven't read Mary Higgins Clark in quite sometime. This book was a great read. She still brings an entertaining thrilling read.

B006GHA9QQ|2.0|It really did not have the same quality of music as the phantom of the opera and was not impressed with the setting or the talent.

086571701X|4.0|i found this to be a great resource for getting started.  lots of stuff from what to consider before you start to how to do it when you do start.  not always a lot of detail on construction, but almost always directs you resources that have the detail.  a little light on the plant management as far as balancing new plantings, harvesting, and removing old plants.  on the whole, very well pleased with the money spent.

B009NY43NY|5.0|I love Charlaine Harris, the minute her books come out i just eat them up! The books always make me laugh and cry with the heroine!
B000FA675C|5.0|I enjoyed the novel because I could increase the size of print and there was enough light to read at night before bed.  I am interested in more free Dan Brown, Patterson,etc., that could be available on Kindle for free.  Da Vinci Code was a travelogue, a historical drama with political and religious insights.
B0051CSI0G|4.0|A vampire plague has run rampant and government has collapsed leaving the people to fend for themselves. Martin, a young boy, is taken under the wing of a vampire hunter, Mister, after his family is viciously slaughtered. The pair are heading North towards New Eden, but find vampires aren't the only predators out there...<br /><br />I enjoy the story in Stake Land. It starts off immediately in the post-apocalyptic world. Martin and Mister are heading North, which is supposed to be safe; they avoid the graveyard-like large cities and use the back roads. However, the vampires aren't the worst thing out in the wild... the living humans can be just as vicious as the undead, if not more. Along the way, they find small cities with survivors trying to get by, they find crazies in the woods, they connect with people like them, and they kill many vampires. It's a survival-apocalyptic blend, and I genuinely enjoy it.<br /><br />The acting is great from the entire cast. There are a few lines of dialogue that felt cheesy and unnatural, but only a few. The story feels like a realistic vampire survival guide, and it keeps this vibe throughout. There is one scene that hurt the realism in the film, and it was a showdown-like scene that felt cliché. The entire atmosphere of the film is bleak, dark and immersive; the story itself is also very bleak as death is around every corner and no one is exempt, including children. It's moderately paced, although it can feel slow at times. The special effects and makeup are great, I really liked the design of the vampires.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed Stake Land; it's an immersive post-apocalyptic horror film that manages to entertain immensely. As of 5/11/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, a purchase is highly recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.<br /><br />Stake Land has strong violence and blood, some nudity (briefly on a deck of cards)
B007TKT2SK|3.0|Thought it would be nice to have when pencil and paper are not always available.  Cooking, sewing and doing many crafts fractions are used and this app. will be there when needed.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Way to short, stops abruptly with no warning.  I understand leaving hangers but there were so many left unfinished it was like it stopped in the middle of the book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|nice large numbers - very easy to use. wish all free products were this good. You can not loss on this one.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|love uk shows and this one is not bad at all. The show in its infancy--hoping it will pick up after more seasons
B009YMNVMO|5.0|It is a very entertaining and funny movie that I can see over and over.  It not only entertains the children but adults too.
B000V63C4Y|5.0|What a great song.  I have been dancing the Samba, at least in my head, all afternoon.  This is such a great Jazz classic that is a must for anyone who likes great music.  It crosses so many genre's that it is hard to categorize as Jazz.  Great song.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is great cause there are +100 games in one app....amazing so yup this app is good for me and shud be for everyone
0425263924|1.0|About a third of the way through this third installment I thought the story was really beginning to drag. I wondered if it couldn't have been done more effectively as one long book, condensing the second and third book drastically. Then I got to the end and it was a big \\"WHAT? A you joking?\\"<br />The first book was so well done in terms of tension and plot. Now the series will go on and on. That may be but I won't be joining the followers.<br />Ms Day, you took a good thing and thinned it out so much that it is becoming a tasteless read.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I enjoyed the Hobbit as much as I enjoyed the Lord of the Rings.  If your a follower its a must have.  Each time I watch it I see something I missed or didn't remember.  It's got beautiful scenery, a great story and I love all the characters.  Suspenseful
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Money well spent. This game keeps you engaged. The more you learn the more fun it is. And you do learn--quite a bit. Definitely reccomend.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|This books  was great because it stands out from what has happened when the monkeys and the role poly bird put the stuff on the ceiling, amazing how much that he was so creative and the writing it just seems to be a great detailed artists and creative writer
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I did enjoy the book but it was not a keep u on the edge of your seat read.  Gideon and Eves story  continued but with no real drama.  I am not dying to know what happens like I was in the last two books.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I'm more inclined towards puzzle games and this one is a great one! Zeptolabs has done it again.  Keeps me thinking and keeps my kids entertained.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Im just wondering do just 7 yr olds just play this game??? jk last game i was like 30 and 19!!! this game is really fun and it gets funner and funner as you unlock new things!!!! You MUST get this app!!!!
B004UID2LC|1.0|When I would download a video, I could not see the request going to either &#34;donwloading&#34; or &#34;downloaded&#34; menus.<br />I better use YouTubeMate which has always been working for me.
B0095P29EG|5.0|My family really enjoyed watching this movie together.  We enjoyed the plot and action in this movie. Definitely worth watching.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Way to go Sylvia. I just love Gideon. I want to go out & get me a Gideon. This story just gets better. Can't wait for #4. Don't wait to long Sylvia. I couldn't put this one down just like I couldn't put the previous series down. It's that good.  If you didn't get it yet I suggest you get it & read it soon.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Runs very well on my kindle fire hd. The initial loading of the game threw me off at first, like it was frozen. Give it a minute it just takes a long time to load. Story was decent and the game lasted just long enough for me to keep interested until the end. Cannot wait for the next one, there better be a next one guys, make it happen.
B005HSL626|4.0|Good way to waste a few minutes.  You have to be fast, but doesn't require much thinking.  Anybody can play.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|the game is pretty fun. It's actually more fun than cut the rope in my opinion. A nice time waster.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very interesting, actually felt like a real story. Sometimes I had to remind myself it was fiction. I would recommend this.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is the best free app of day that I have received yet. Although I do wish it could be displayed on the screen at all times, it is simple enough to pull it up through notifications quickly.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is designed really nice and it is fun to play, however it is practically impossible to expand Ponyville very far without spending a ridiculous amount of time and/or money on the game. It is a nice time killer, but I wish the in-game costs were more reasonable.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|A fun puzzle game. Really good for short five minute breaks, can be played quickly. Also good for killing 20 minutes. Definitely worth the money.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Very dissatisfied and disappointed. There is no plot and it dragged on. This was a waste of money. How can this story still continue?
B005LAIIJY|5.0|A bit bloody, but very entertaining.  For a long movie, this one kept my attention until the very end.  Highly Recommended!!
0470474874|3.0|Pros:  Thorough coverage across every Excel topic I can imagine.<br /><br />Cons: The paper is so thin you see text from the other side of the pages.  Combined with a very small and thin font, this makes reading the text a real chore.  You definitely will need the reading glasses for this one, even if you don't need them for other books.  Also, the included CD has a PDF of the entire book.  That's nice, but the book's index in the PDF is just text, no links.  I work with plenty of technical publications and the indexes normally have clickable links for the entries so you can jump straight to the text locations.<br /><br />Summary: Author and content are good, but the publisher cut lots of corners and it shows.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|A trilogy means 3 books, I feel deceived. $30 later and this is what we get? I returned my purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft! It's just fun!<br /><br />But the only bad thing is they have not updated it yet but they have for Apple products and Samsung products so I have to play all by my self but my friends get to play together so if you get this app you will not get to play with your friends  would wait until the update
067144901X|4.0|lovely and funny pictures for those animal lover kids. Also nice book for those starting to learn how to read.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This games is addictive! Once you start, you can't stop. Graphics are great and eye catching. It's a very easy game to play.
0689835604|5.0|My son has been in love with this book since the first day. He keeps asking me to read it and play with him and the book. Very cute images.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|See it.  Get it.  Beautiful performances, haunting voices.  The entire family loves it and we listen to it all the time.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son loves Angry Birds and is an avid Star Wars fan. So, I rewarded him with the app. He is loving it, especialy on long rides in the car. By the way, my son is 15.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft. And when I found out that it was available on the kindle fire I got it immediately. The game is not exactly like computer but it is still fun. My only wish is that the updates for kindle fire would come out at the same time as apple products. Thank you Mojang.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I have never been a fan of Ken Follett, and have read most of his books as our book club takes them on for reading and review.<br />The Pillars of the Earth was the only book I truly liked.  Did he write it?  Fall of Giants is not well researched for the<br />period of World War 1 and would appear to be a review of Downton Abby.  Will pass on the trilogy.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This wonderfully acted Roman chronicle is by far one of the best I have ever seen. If you missed it on HBO do not miss it on DVD.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|Wonderful talented musicians recreating their magic from years past. Highly recommended! Both audio and video are top notch. Just great.
B00CRS5HII|4.0|I am not much of a fan for the modern country (pop rock) era, but this album really hit a sweet spot for me! It is very reminiscent of the true, dyed in he wool, days of country with just enough steel guitar, banjo and mandolin to really enjoy.
B009DH379C|5.0|One of the few bands that sounded as good live as in the studio (Pink Floyd would be another). Freddie Mercury had no equal. A supremely talented singer and showman. Great video.
B008OOYALE|4.0|it is a great game but kindle players can't have the spellshop, battle arena, trading portal, pink dragons, fairytale dragons, prize wheel, dawn tree, quest outpost, treasure dragon, boosted breed, coin increasers, passion pit, or the right hearted or left hearted dragons. Other than those those few quirks it is an awesome game. Please add those and I will re-review this as 5 stars.
B003W5C0VM|1.0|Though I love the Stones this reminds me of how awful they can be in live concerts.  Save your money.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|Love the game but when you put your own answer in because you stumped him you don't know if it really got inputted as the only button is &quot;Home&quot; then he doesn't tally the loss. It says 33 out of 33 and I know I stumped him a few times.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm used to reading books targeted for an older crowd and thought this one might be &#34;too young&#34; for my taste, but it proved me wrong. I couldn't stop reading once I started. I'm purchasing the second one through Kindle right now. Fantastic read!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Outstanding game. Really enjoyable to play and great fun for nonsense time. Just don't waste your day away with such things
1401937519|5.0|I read this book while going through cancer treatment.  It was a great help to me emotionally and spiritually.  I have read it again and read certain parts at times. Her understanding of how our fears create disease in our bodies rang true for me.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|4.5 stars. I liked it more then Reflected in You but slightly less then Bared to You. I'm not feeling a review at the moment but I WILL stay I don't see any reason why anyone who loved the first 2 wouldn't love this one too. The writing is the same. The characters are consistent with who they've always been. There its no more or less sex then the other 2. And it is NOT a \\"filler\\" book. There are a lot of things happening throughout, it wasn't boring, it didn't drag.<br /><br />As far as the backlash SD is facing, she revealed that she was extending the series quite some time ago. If people didn't approve, they shouldn't have read the damn book.<br /><br />I feel badly for Sylvia, watching her \\"fans\\" turn on her without justifiable reason. No WAY,  by no standards, is this a 1 star book. Keep kicking ass Sylvia and your real fans will keep eating it up.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|LOVED first 2 books (easily 2 a.m. reads), had to force myself to read the majority of this 3rd book (kept falling asleep and it was 9 p.m.)... completely agree with other reviews on lack of character development (other than Gideon), seems this series was purposely drawn out, save your money and re-read the 1st and 2nd books or wait until the 5th book comes out and read that.  And cliffhanger?  What cliffhanger?  There is none!<br /><br />My 1 star rating is based on the book.<br /><br />Side note: Sylvia posted a comment on her facebook explaining the change in this release date (not her fault)and how she can't control the price (she'd make the same amount, if not more, starting another series)... It was good to hear and understand publishing and authors in her post; however, as her customer, it was disappointing how she passed blame and took no accountability nor offered assurance to us readers on how she'll make this \\"right\\". She has a new series coming out in August that sounds really good! With how she handled this series, I will not purchase anymore from her until the last book of a series is published.  She's lost my trust.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fantastic story, great build up to finish, interesting views on politics, war, personalities. All round one of the very best books in its genre ever!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Great movie, if you havn't seen it its worth watching a few times, RDJ is always great. R D J
B0063IH60K|5.0|Like t play card games because I have to rest alot with my COPD and it helps pass the time more enjoyable with a variety of things to do.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I read this quick in between books in a series. Good story that made me appreciate the people in my life.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Arrived in two days as promised. Love the Blue-ray/DVD combo as we have yet to purchase a blu-ray player but will be sometime in the near future. Great show.
0399157565|1.0|This was the worst book I read in 12 years.  I say 12 because I struggled thru a Steven King book in the same way 12 years ago.  Don't ask me why I just can't stop reading the book when this happens to me.  I love the excitement of getting to \\"what's next?\\"  None of this here.  It went on and on about things that were boring.  It jumped back and forth constantly making it hard to follow and the ending was as dull as the whole book.  I have read other Patricia Cornwell books that were very good but THE BONE BED was a complete waste of money!  If you no longer have a story to tell - stop writing please!
145210655X|5.0|I bought it as a present for my husband on Fathers Day. He is star wars fun. He likes the book a lot. I even find it funny too. Cute little book. Cute pictures. For star wars fun- cool present.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|The young James Kirk  and Spock's  childhood and challenges to the rapid rise of  the flamboyant Captain Kirk.  Great fun to watch and entertaining.
0553801473|5.0|I haven't finished the book so far but it is the fifth book in A Game of Thrones, and has so far met all expectations.  These aren't the great books ever written, but they aren't the worst either, and are very entertaining.
0307730700|5.0|Just a great story. Adam's story is inspirational. Eric Blehm is a wonderful story teller. I highly recommend thi a book.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|This is a good movie, I knew that when I bought it.  I received what I expected,  it works great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is just as fun...if not more than temple run. I play everyday without fail sometimes more than once.
B002VWNICC|5.0|I knew this movie was great when I bought it and I received what I expected.  No surprises here.  Enjoy.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|This as usual is a great CD from Darius :-)<br />Would suggest buying it if you are a fan of great music<br />Great
B00499NHLC|4.0|I noticed that whenever I watched an episode in the regular resolution (not HD) the video played fine, but when I watched the HD version the video would freeze multiple times throughout the episode almost as if it was buffering over and over. It may have been my internet connection, but I'm not sure, just throwing that out there. Overall, Sherlock is an amazing series & I'm sad that there's only 3 episodes in each series (season) to watch!!
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|there must be 50 songs in this set that compete with each  other very well made, sounds better than ever  you did a great job putting this together
B008133MDK|5.0|The video quality was excellent, it never froze or took any time to buffer once it had started. I've recently fallen in love with this series and the acting is amazing! If you haven't already, go see Star Trek: Into Darkness. Benedict Cumberbatch (who plays Sherlock) is phenomenal as John Harrison aka the villian Khan!!
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|ringos good at making you feel young again classic songs really classy material all the old standards  are so good to hear very good album hats off to  ringo again
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Django was a surprise. The previews show it to be funny but really its pretty bloody. It shows a lot of hardships of slavery and I just wasn't expecting to see it in this movie.
6304498969|5.0|this is not a new dvd so for it to still hold its own is something else everything about this dvd  was very well done. remains to be my favorite disc
B007N8RULO|5.0|I absolutely love playing this game!  Easy to learn, still no luck with the advanced level but I still love playing it
034580404X|5.0|These books were actually really good, I had heard mixed reviews so wanted to judge for myself. There is just something about dark, sexy, and sweet that captivates you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great pass time  I  have always loved card games and this makes it easy<br />I even play it while watching tv
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Ok it wasn't as good as the other two but it was equally exciting. I really didn't flget into the book until the second part
B006GWO5NE|4.0|This was just what I needed as I lost my charging cord.  Better than buying a whole new system or not being able to use my Kindle
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I love playing this game, it is a lot of fun.  I just wish I was better at it.  Maybe if I play more
B00992CF6W|4.0|I just received the update on my iPod, so why hasn't it updated here? I love this game though, but if I don't get the update soon, I won't play it very much longer.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite tv shows, and this season is so awesome!!! I would highly recommend it to everyone!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|you should get this app because it tells you what is at and you click the top and it tells you if it is at 5% 25% and if you clime the app it pops up stuff you need to now about your tablet insted of going in settings.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Easy reading & well illustrated book, the content was very helpful in building my book. Would reccomend it to anyone writing for the first time on Kindle.
0061777269|3.0|In 2001 Dr. van Lommel reported in the British journal Lancet the results of his prospective study of 344 cardiac arrest patients who had undergone 599 resuscitations from 1988-1992, in regard to what is commonly referred to as near-death experiences (NDE). What struck me in that paper was the relative paucity of patients who had reported a \\"definite\\" NDE: 12 per cent! When he added other patients who claimed to have had some less specific memories the total reached 18 per cent. Other studies which had been retrospective in nature rather than prospective, as van Lommel's was, had reported considerably higher occurrences. After having read the article I ordered the book in the hope that more information would be presented. In this I was disappointed because only 23 of the 340 text pages dealt with the medical scientific assessment of NDEs. The rest provide background for the author's speculation in regard to \\"endless-nonlocal consciousness.\\" But before discussing those I should mention that the book did provide data on three additional studies where  NDE's had occurred at a rate of 11, 15 and 23% respectively. The highest number was based on a small sample of  39 cardiac arrest patients of whom 18 per cent reported an NDE while 5 per cent had only an out of body experience (OBE) without other concomitants. The 15% value came from a study by Drs. Parnia and Fenwick which provided the basis for Parnia's  subsequent  AWARE project which was presented in his recent book \\"Erasing Death.\\" The results of this study, which I also reviewed for amazon, were even more revealing. Of 100 patients only five had a NDE and two a pure OBE.  I am presenting these data here because the subtitle of van Lommel's book is \\"The Science of the Near-Death Experience.\\" These data show not only that the phenomenon exists but that is quite rare and in addition that we have no scientific explanation for it.<br />The rest of the book tries to provide evidence why the question raised in the Introduction: \\"Does consciousness have a biological basis at all?\\" was answered with a \\"no\\" by the author. This led to the main title \\"Consciousness beyond Life,\\" which in my opinion would have required at least one question mark. The reader is, of course free to choose between what is written here and Dr. van Lommel's point of view but  she/he should be encouraged to think about  the topic carefully and reach a conclusion that is neither based on preconceptions nor wishful thinking.<br />In regard to Dr. van Lommel's above cited question my own work has led me to conclude that consciousness without a brain is a hypothesis rather than a fact. Disembodied consciousness communicating with another disembodied entity, which is what nonlocal consciousness implies, cannot be demonstrated. Any experiment which might be designed is in its final stages always interpreted by a human being with a fully functioning brain. This applies, of course, not only to NDEs but also quantum physics which is usually, including in this book, resorted to in order to cover our ignorance with a scientific mantle. Man is still \\"the measure of all things\\" and the measuring device, as well as the interpretation of the results, and their application to life require a human brain.  We may abdicate our responsibility to a computer someday but that is still a fantasy or in my view a nightmare. When we return from a potential world of quantum physics to our actual day to day consciousness Dr. van  Lommel seems to fail to distinguish between subjective internal awareness/consciousness/reality and that level in which we operate with open eyes when we are engaged in our daily tasks. I am saying this because he also asked: \\"Where am I when I sleep? Can I be conscious of anything during sleep?\\" The answer is: of course! All of us dream and not only during the REM stage. Whether or not we can dream during coma is a currently unanswered question but could lend itself to research. I believe it is erroneous when we ascribe more \\"reality\\" to one over the other and especially to a potential afterlife.<br />The fact that some NDEs appear to be more \\"real\\" to the experiencer than what is present in waking life or dreams can also merely indicate the absence of doubt. This is a crucial variable which neuroscientists ought to spend some time on. What makes doubt, and what abolishes it? At present we don't know but this is a question that needs to be addressed because an unbiased evaluation of NDEs depends on it.<br />In contrast to one of the reviewers I would like to congratulate Dr. van Lommel for putting the organ transplant ethical problem squarely on the table. Whether or not one likes to think about it: we are in fact removing organs from a body that is in the early process of dying but not yet dead. This distinction is crucial because a dead organ cannot be used for transplants. This simple fact alone shows that for instance Dr. Parnia's book title \\"Erasing Death\\" was inappropriate.  The ethical problem resides in the fact that by removing organs from a still living person, whom we judge to be dying anyway, we make sure that there will be no return to life in the here and now. Decisions of this type can readily become utilitarian and killing for sake of the greater good, which in essence was the Nazis' justification for their crimes, may become again appealing.<br />Dr. van Lommel's medical work on patients who are being resuscitated after cardiac arrest is important, needs to be encouraged and funded; possibly in conjunction with Dr. Parnia's previously mentioned AWARE project. But conclusions about never-ending consciousness in absence of a brain and an eternal afterlife appear to be definitely premature.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A detailed and well written account of how Osama Bin Ladin was killed.  This book reads like an adventure novel, but this one is true.  One feels they are actually there, as with all good books.  You learn about all the possibilities for something going wrong and how flexible these warriors are in adjusting to and overcomming the problems encountered.  You will be in the compound and right on the helicopter running on the last drop of fuel as they were returning from the mission.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The title intrigued me, and I like stories that take place in different cultures or times. This turned out to be more intricate in storyline than expected. Although done for a reason, the country Irish dialog seemed a bit overdone. Overall, the story was a good read.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is an excellent and account of an America Hero.  I highly recommend it, as it is an eye witness view of the actual situations in combat and the restrictions that our soldiers face in trying to do their duty to keep our country free.  It is a real shame that Chris Kyle's life was cut short by virtue of him trying to work with soldiers who were still suffering from the combat they experienced.  Chris would had made even more major contributions to our society if he had ot been taken so young.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|This book is indeed life change.<br />It's amazing how simple habits can dictate our life course.<br /><br />As soon as you take notice of them and how capable they are of running your life it's much easier to create a new routine that will in the end, take you where you want to go.
B003W9JELC|4.0|My eleven year old daughter has been wanting to see this for a long time.  I finally broke down and we rented it for movie night.  While there are no surprises in the plot it was enjoyable and both my daughter and I had a good time.
B000W8HC8I|3.0|This is a book that you will love or will hate.<br />It shows the glamour and not so glamour life of a broker that thought he own the world.<br /><br />One thing this book definitely shows you is what NOT TO DO when you have too much money on your hands.<br />Apart from that, the author goes in details that could be left out since it really goes out of the scope of the book. Some chapters are really pornographic with the author going in details about is sexual endeavors.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game brings out the gamer in me that i haven't felt since playing MW3 , Imagination runs wild with this game. Truely a game that gets it. Graphics arent what games are about, its about amazing game play.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is super addicting!! My daughter loves playing, as well. The only complaint I have is that some of the items are waaaaay too hard to get and you end up having to friend request strangers so they can give the item to you. Other than that.. I LOVE it!
B00COGY2P2|3.0|The plot was excellent - the acting was okay - the action was okay / a good mid-week I am bored and can count on Tom Cruise movie.<br /><br />Tom has set the bar so high that it is tough for him to reach it every-time!<br /><br />Tom seems to be transitioning into more thriller less action -<br /><br />That is what ya do when you are old!<br /><br />(The one bar scene they must have hired all short actors cause Tom actually looks tall for once!)

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book let you see how Ana think when she get involved with Mr Gary. Interest perspective, I wish I know this when I was young. The book start out and get you in the first two pages, and continues. Note: this is \\"R\\" rated, maybe \\"R\\".

B008JJM88Q|5.0|I love this app. It has pictures and asks a bunch of questions and a variaty of options to answer a question
B000UBMUIE|5.0|I am a fan and listener of jazz music. Art Pepper was not really on my list until I heard an LP. I was hooked. This album is so \\"listenable\\". If you are a hardcore jazz fan you need no introduction. If you are a lukewarm jazz fan this album will kindle an interest that could catch fire for more of his stuff. Good music, good album.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Minecraft was my favorite game, but when it had an update on the kindlefire for shade and mountain caves, then EVERYTHING was gone! All I had was the things I was carrying in my pocket. Everything else just dissappeared. Everything in the chests and out of your hands was just gone. Even houses. Kindlefire owners, watch out! All I had left was scenery and some stuff in my pockets. On creative, everything that you ever made is gone.

0425263924|5.0|As always Sylvia Day will captivate you from the first page in Giddeon and Eva's lives.  These are two of the most troubled characters I have ever come across, but you can't help but love them.  This being the 3rd book in the Crossfire saga dives a little deeper into the lives and histories of the two main characters.  I loved that we were able to see a bit more about what makes these characters so troubled and that knowledge just makes you love them more.  I cannot get enough of these books I'm will be waiting not so patiently for the next one.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Ms. Chase is freaking brilliant; from the characters to the plot, the story was compelling and well written. I absolutely love that the story is told from Drew's pov. He is rude, obnoxious, hilarious, crass and lovable at the same dang time! I love that Kate is a strong independent heroine. She knows what she wants and does not let Drew or anyone else walk over her. Some of the side characters, such as Drew's niece Mckenzie and his best friend Matthew added a nice touch to Kate and Drew's story. Both main characters are fully developed and as you read their story you have a good understanding if who they are.<br />I would definitely recommend this story to people who love a great love story! I am a sucker for love and raunchy sex scenes intertwined and this novel was spot on. No spoilers in this review, but I must warn you that there are very graphic sex scenes and vulgar context throughout the story! If you are okay with that then PURCHASE THIS BOOK... It was WORTH THE MONEY!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Not worth .99 let alone 9.99.  Ms. Day sold out to the publishers and it shows in this lack luster attempt at extended sensational eroticsm.  I honestly wish she had ended this series gracefully at book 2.  This 5 part series is sad and obviously she is focused on the funds more than the quality or content of her work.  Sad to say...she is no longer on my must read list.  Sadly,  i can tell you the ending of this 5 part dragged out redundant novel...they end up together at the high price of amazon readers who wish they could afford to smash their kindles when reading tripe for 9.99 a book times 5.  Ugh save us.
0143122916|5.0|Never knew the details about these camps in NKorea; had seen them on aerial photos; but, to read a first hand , account of being born and raised in this environment is shocking beyond comprehension. May God replace the years the locusts have eaten with this young man, a worthy, valuable human being. My pets live better than he did. God help us if we continue to live in ignorance or worse yet, to be informed, and do nothing.
1455502758|5.0|I always enjoyed reading or listening to anything Hitchens said.  This short book on his impending death is a wonderful read.
B00003OSSM|5.0|This is another one of those movies I have to watch a couple times a year.  I just love the story and the ending!  So grab a glass of wine, a blanket, turn down the lights, hit the couch and enjoy!  Huh?  Think I'll have to this weekend.... it's been a while.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|nice size -- what I like best are the compartments -- can hold the battery charger, cords etc all in one place.
0515153656|5.0|I read this book after I finished a reread of one of my favorite series, as I knew it would probably be an easy and entertaining read, and I was definitely right. I just really enjoyed the book, blasting through it in about 3 days, as this is a real page turner. I loved the character of Reacher, especially how badass and efficient he is, along with a lot of other idiosyncrasies the character has that makes him very unique. My only small problems I found with the book were that there was a lot of unlikely coincidences that came into play throughout the story, the set up for the finale was a little predictable, and the novel felt it's age. Out of those three, the worst is probably how much the novel felt its age, as parts of the story feel very odd (where only one person who's really rich has a \\"mobile phone\\") including the main conspiracy this story is based around, as it just wouldn't work in today's world. Still, I really loved this book, and I plan to read more of them, although it's really annoying that 20 year old books are priced so highly, especially with the ebook higher than the paperback. I might just end up loaning them from the library, unless the books are still on sale at target (that's where I bought this one when the Reacher movie came out as they had them on sale).
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Great story line loved reading and wad not happy that it ended so soon. Can't wait for the next book in the crossover novels to come out and I hope I don't have to wait so long this time as I did for this one. Happy reading people.
0425263924|2.0|It took way to long for this book to come out...I have to say if I was Eva I would be sick of Gideon all ways running to Corinne. In this book thats all Gideon did. I would have put my foot down, Yes he killed for her. It was to much. One thing I don't get is why Eva puts up w/ Gideon's S#@%. Sometimes he doesn' tcall her back or text her back, come on. Any Girl now and day would flip out on their man/husband. But Eva just has sex. The story was draged on, so now I will have to wait forever for book 4.I hope book 4 will b better.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Wow, what a journey! I was engulfed as soon as it started. These are great actors that portray and bring you into what really happened. Fantastic movie, so moving to see the kindness we should always show. So many stories didn't have the same outcome.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|if you love reading classic books I highly recommend this one. Its an excellent read and theres nothing better then reading a good book
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Loved this movie! There was action, humor, history, great characters and a good story line. The scenery and effects were AWESOME!
B000JQUMPI|5.0|if you love reading classic books I highly recommend this one. Its an excellent read and theres nothing better then reading a good book
006224454X|3.0|You know all along that something is wrong. You wonder why the main character has no friends, only a mysterious &#34;therapist&#34;... and then it all comes together in the final chapter. OK. Next time, perhaps more depth of character and a more realistic story.

B002ZG9940|2.0|I can't imagine anyone having conscience to charge for this garbage at the movie theaters. The only way for a studio to show it without guilt is for free on TV. In this thriller, Clooney plays a professional killer , American ( Clooney was probably too lazy to fake Italian accent, so the director had to come up with an &#34;ingeniously&#34; conceived title)  who is on a mission in a small Italian village. We often see him working out  in the morning the way a middle age gentleman would without looking silly, walking empty narrow  streets, drinking coffee in an empty cafe, occasionally having sex with a cute prostitute with not so good teeth ( she is European , you know , they are not so dental - conscious ) .  Then , there is an action part where he makes a silencer out of some garage trash , practices with a sniper rifle , gets followed by some crippled mentally and physically assassin  and in the end ....you probably have figured it out by now.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|It was vary interesting and vary good and I can't wait to see the movie.<br /><br />I think the author should make even more books.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I've always been a fan of Archer's &#34;family saga&#34; books.  I have thoroughly enjoyed each installment of the Clifton series.  IMO, any readers that have enjoyed the previous installments will certainly enjoy this one.  Some readers may say &#34;it's just more of the same&#34;.  But,  IMO, that is a good thing.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very interesting and informative look behind the curtain at both the man and the company the helped define the multimedia experience for the past 25 years.
B004WJRTXG|4.0|Great topic, told in a very friendly manner, the sarcasm is hysterical. Good reflexion of life in general. Really enjoyed it
B006M4F67A|5.0|I like the challenge of trying to beat the clock, the variety of tiles and layouts.  Trying to beat my previous times is one of the best features.  I would like to see a screen telling you how to match tiles that are not exactly alike.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|So disappointed. To many unanswered plots, a 4th story to come at least a year from now (that I will not buy). I wouldn't dream of ruining the story for others but it just wasn't worth the wait.  I loved Gideon and Eva's story until this book. Nothing gets accomplished in this book except the opening for at least another. Sorry Sylvia trying to hard to contine your fame.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|There was good interaction between the charcters.  Looking forward to the Reds 2 coming out in a few months. Outstanding!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|My least favorite in this series. I was extremely disappointed. I hope Sylvia Day redeems herself in a Book #4.
B009NY43NY|5.0|The last book does not disappoint. I will miss my Sookie tales. I never cared for the tv series but love these books!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|What a great game my son loves the cut the rope games and now he's having nonstop entertainment with this game. And I might add it's fun for Me to help him.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i love this app. it lets me take note of everything on my<br />kindle fayah!! its really convenient. and i love the connectivity between my kindle, my pc and my phone
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app because it is Fruit Ninja and it is free. I have some serious fun slicing up fruit when I have some down time.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|I am finally giving up on Jeffrey Archer!  The Clifton Chronicles were supposed to be a trilogy - Best Kept Secret ends with yet another cliffhanger.  Mr Archer is obviously going to continue to spew out further books in this series and this latest one is boring with very little character development.  Sorry, but that's it for me - I won't fall into the trap of buying the next book.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Among all the games trying to emulate MineCraft this is the best one. The graphics are vibrant and gameplay is smooth.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Well written saga that keeps your interest peaked as you share the lives and adventures of craftsmen, monks, knights and royalty in merry olde England!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it offers a different enviroment through game play and is awesome fun and is different than Temple Run.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Good way to spend some down time. Not easy to get your upgrades so persistence is needed. Fun overall recommend for anyone to play.
B00297FEUS|5.0|The various songs have special meaning to me, and the Heavy Metal genre' is one of my favorite forms of entertainment.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|You know its bad when your reading erotica (romantica?) and you skip most of the sex scenes.  Not only is the trilogy not a trilogy but the story itself was horrible.  It was overly full of drama without any type of resolution before heading off to the next drama.  The main characters are sappy and whinny with each other and it felt forced.  The end result of reading this book for me is that I dont care what happens to Eva and Gideon.  And I won't buy the next book to find out.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|While I enjoyed the book I understand why people are upset that this was not the last book, I on the other hand went to her web site and read her question and answer session and she said that it was a possibility that this would not be the last book so I was already prepared.
B000089RV6|5.0|Brand new spotless CD that plays that same old music that I loved growing up.  Great condition, good price.  Thank You
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game!I think it is the best game on my kindle!!!My favorite<br />character is Jake!He is my lucky character on the game.
0738737909|4.0|Excellent and pretty deck to collectors and readers..the only card i didn't apreciate so much was the \\"Strenght\\"..because the sample is not in \\"zoom\\" like the rest of the majors arcanas..the deck is very detailed and vibrant..**** 4 STARS.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Ok First off it was GREAT!!!! I loved it. It is my Favorite series. I am so ecstatic there will be another book. When reading other series or trilogies I have often times wanted more and this series is not the exception. I am so thankful we get a little more! I read the reviews of others and I disagree with the cliff hanger...other books i read you literally had to have the next book there b/c it stopped mid paragraph in the middle of the situation. This book leaves you wanting more with issues not completely solved but could be wrapped up if she wanted to hurry it in a chapter or two but she is giving us a anther whole book which is awesome. B/c of the reviews i actually re-read the last chapter wondering did i miss something happening that just stopped in the middle. I felt like it was a great book definitely worth reading. I couldn't put it down. I love that the cover doesn't have to draw you in that the book does it for itself.
159463176X|5.0|This was a great book.  As well written as The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, and though it is a thought-provoking book, it isn't as completely heartbreaking as the first two works.  I love the plot twists and turns and how all of the different characters are intertwined.  If you like books that make you think, and even cry a bit, this is a wonderful book!  I am going to read it again already.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Loyaly before cash? Guess not. Thanks to posted feedback I'm  going to save my 9.99 for another author.  Sorry some of you wasted your time & money....but appreciate the heads up on what sounds like a huge failure.
0307730700|5.0|Having read previous book written about and by Navy SEAL's, I have to say this was the most well written I had read, having read about all that Adam had to over come, I find his life an exhibit what a SEAL is and I will continue to tell every one I can that they need to read this book.
159102594X|5.0|I picked up The Blade Itself for a camping trip a few years back but hadn't had a chance to read it until recently.  From Logan Nine-fingers first introduction, I loved this book.  Joe Abercrombie made a remarkable story following the intersecting lives of six very different characters.  Each and every one of them is lovable, loathsome and wonderfully, remarkably human. The situations these six characters find themselves in are realistic and yet fantastic at the same time.  It is witty and gritty, truly a pulls-no-punches epic that is clearly only just beginning in The Blade Itself.<br /><br />If your looking for a good adventure and don't mind gore and some cussing, this is definitely the book for you.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|I have this one in my car and never get tired of it. I play it over and over.<br />Thanks Willie love you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mojang need  to update minecraft pe. The update came out on the itouch yesterday why don't we kindle users get an update too! P.S. put infinite world size
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Does what its suppose to do. All buttons works.<br />However no program/disc was included so had to go online to find the program that configures the mouse<br /><br />Overall for the price it's a nice buy.<br />Sturdy construction. Ok grade material. Its wat u would expect for the money ur putting in
B00006CXSS|5.0|I like the way different directors and writers handle each episode - usually from the perspective of a different one of the men of Easy Company. For example, one episode set in Bastogne is done from the perspective of a medic. Another episode, after that, is from the perspective of Webster, who missed Bastogne because he was in the hospital. The other men resented his not having shared in their misery during those cold winter months in the trenches, being blown to bits. But he shows himself worthy on &#34;The Last Patrol.&#34;<br /><br />It's a great series. The only feature film that I think comes close to the grit and realism of Band Of Brothers is Battleground, from 1949. It, too, is shown from the perspective of the average soldier, not the leaders. That's what makes this series so unique - most war films are written from the perspective of the leadership or the historian because they're based on the memoirs of various military leaders. Most people want to know what it was like for the average Joe.<br /><br />Also, the production values are through the roof. This is probably one of the best mini-series ever made. It will definitely live on as a classic.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Another great Bond movie with Daniel Craig. Lots of action and suspense. You'll be on the edge of your seat!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I use the words &#34;family film&#34; with reservation because it is full of violence. But it does remind me of some of the old Disney animal movies, like Old Yeller, etc. It's inspirational and memorable because of the various relationships people have with the horse. But then there is the violence of World War I, which was a very inhumane war. That inhumanity becomes disturbingly real when this magnificent breed is used to haul cannon - a job that soon kills most horses - and later when he gets entangled in barbed wire. His journey through WWI is incredible; but his original owner, a young farm-boy-turned-soldier, never gives up on reuniting with him. This is an edge-of-your-seat suspense film, action film, and heart-warming tear-jerker that you won't forget.<br /><br />Great acting, great production values, and the horses used are absolutely amazing.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|After calling Amazon  customer service to say that the original cable was faulty with deteriorating insulation coming off, I was pleasantly surprised at the offer of a free replacement .  I can't remember  EVER having such fantastic service  !  The service rep, Raven, was so nice, courteous and accommodating !  She even gave me expedited  (and free) delivery service. PLUS  a bonus of a discount on future purchases. Such service  I have never experienced before !!!  So far the new cable is working just fine. It actually appears to be of a better quality than the original one that came with my Kindle. Hats off to Amazon for a superior job on customer service ! ! !  Thanks for a great experience !
0545265355|5.0|I really like fantasy, so this series is really up my alley. Not Harry Potter quality, but certainly enjoyable enough
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was by far my favorite of the 3 !!! It turned into a great love story and still the same heat between them!!!
0345529057|3.0|I really enjoy the HBO series, but I have found the books a rather tedious read. None of the magic of Tolkien or Harry Potter
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game but , they cheat . For example , i will swipe it it will cheat and will make me lose . Also my Nanna`s Subway Surfers updated , she lost all her keys. SHE HAD 45 OF THEM !!!! So now I don't play as often.<br />:o OMG !! TO BAD!
0316228532|3.0|I expected quite a bit more from one of our favorite authors. I hope she decides to explore the Harry Potter world more, maybe not Potter himself, but other aspects of that world
B001MEJY8W|5.0|If you like bloody movies, you should definitely have this in your collection. I bought it without seeing it first and I'm glad I took a chance on it. Probably one of my favorite movies
B00B2166BS|5.0|If you have a nexus 10 you really need to purchase this. The ease of charging is worth buying. Attaches easily with magnetic connection.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I read an interview with Charlaine Harris where she said she tried to wrap up all the unfinished story lines in this book and it shows.  While I was disappointed in with the ending it does makes sense but overall the story was just tired.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Well it crashes on the startup screen and says not connected to internet when I click on advanced options. Pretty useless app
B00005N6KG|5.0|This appears to be an exact copy of the original headset that came with the Sony walkman tape player/AM/FM/TV. Good reception on FM (headset functions as antenna in this Walkman). Also works with newer Walkman radio.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|This show was so great and definitely worth watching for a first time, or again(as I'm doing now) as a reminder of how adorable this show was and its characters. It had so many great episodes and moments. Classic one liners from Jack to the quick bite of Jo and of course all the techno babble that made no sense to me from everyone else in the show. The cast had great chemistry and it shows. The people that worked  on it put everything they had into it and you can see that in every episode. A must watch even for those who aren't a fan of Sci-Fi based shows, bc this show goes far beyond that.
B0040HO16S|5.0|After I found this show on my local PBS station one night, I wanted to see more. I  recently watched the entire series on Amazon Instant Video and  yearn for more. I didn't want it to end. We desperately  need more quality  programs  such as this wonderfully delightful period piece. I feel I  truly got to know these people. It is a shame it was not continued. I  am hoping they will make at least a movie perhaps.  Watching all of  these BBC shows(Downton Abbey, Call the Midwife, etc.) is my one weakness. :-)
B002JVWRAY|5.0|I loved the first five seasons of this show! I couldn't wait to own it, and chose to get it on blu ray instead of DVD. Best decision I made!
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|This review specifically is about the Kindle version of &#34;Watchmen,&#34; but to be honest, it is not so much about the book itself (which is excellent and that I've read several times) but about the Kindle approach to comics and graphic novels.<br /><br />I'm reading this via the Kindle app on the iPad, which is an amazing way to digest the book. I'm very happy with the frame-by-frame treatment, which has some advantages over other popular comic book-reading apps.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Kindle version of this book.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I did NOT wanna see this movie while it was in theaters but this is a SUPER cute and funny movie. My boyfriend even likes it!
B004ELSDZK|3.0|its okay if you've got plenty of time to think about each move you're making or have made,but when you don't have the time it sucks.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A perfect little app that does exactly what it says it will do.  Easy to install, easy to use.  I recommend it highly.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like his app because it gives voltage and current draw and temperature.  Might be more understandable for some if current was in amps with a decimal point. Works great as expected.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I love Denzel and try to see all of his work. I was not thrilled with this movie, but I did like it. The movie focuses on a pilot that has a drinking problem. In spite of his ability to bring down a faulty plane and save so many, his drug/alcohol abuse is the focus of a man on a spiral downward. I do recommend the movie, be aware that it is rated R.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched  movie before reading the book and  I'm so glad I did it in this order. I've ruined every movie by reading the  book first. I was on the edge of my seat with the movie and couldn't put the book down I was so involved with the details with the characters you couldn't  put in the  movie. Basically if you tried  talking to me during my reading time, you didn't exist until I was done lol.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this trilogy, but when a friend gave me the set I had to read it! So glad I did.
B005ILYWN2|5.0|I first thought this was going to be a movie where you really don't see anything. That everybody's going to run at first noise so to speak. The first sight of the first troll is breath taking. Almost want believe there are trolls on this earth. The way they made this movie makes it looks real. If your into fantasy like me you wont be disappointed.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|As a woman who does not really go for the chick flick kind of movies, but does enjoy the light-hearted stories every now and again, this movie really hit the spot for me. There were parts of the movie where i thought, this is an interesting redux of the Romeo and Juliet story. At it's core, it's a love story, but not sappy and with many funny parts to it. I was also happy to see Rob Cordry do a really great job with his part as the lead character's best friend; nice to see him in a heart-warming role and not playing the crass, politically incorrect buddy he usually gets cast into. overall, I really enjoyed the movie and am planning to buy the movie after having rented it!
0316223239|3.0|The choice of writing from the perspective of a 5 year old to an adult audience is risky. I tired of it after 50 pages, although the story was compelling.
B00CJ32S74|2.0|I thought it would have been better and it got on my nerves after awhile. I like soundtracks a lot because of the variety but they tried too hard.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|love it. I play it all the time and u can also earn stars and not have to buy levels recommend it
0761169431|5.0|I bought this book for my son who has loved Star Wars for years.  He is very artistic and I knew he would enjoy it.
6302642248|5.0|I ordered these for a Boys Home. They were so happy! With Jesus and Disney, we can make a difference!
B009POCG2C|4.0|I like the dynamic between the actors in this film. It's comedic and heartwarming. Clint Eastwood is a classic, Justin Timberlake is getting more of my appreciation as he molds his craft of acting and you can't go wrong with John Goodman not to mention the balsy character that Amy Adam plays is nice to see a girl be able to take care of herself and that baseball isn't just for boys, she knows her stuff. ; ')<br /><br />Cute storyline<br /><br />A Must watch
B00005JMJG|5.0|Pretty much the only movie I am able to take Jim Carrey seriously in. The acting is phenomenal and the plot will through your mind for a loop. The best love story of all time, in my opinion.
B000000OMP|3.0|Bottom line, Mr. Coverdale owes everything..EVERYTHING to Mr. John Sykes incredible talent and saving his ass. Whitensake is good, but can not hold a candle to Blue Murder. Too bad Eddie \\"skunk\\" Trunk (you know that great suppossed friend of Mr. Sykes??)does not have the guts to call Coverdale out to his face. As for the album, it is a good album...period.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is amazing I am so happy me and my friends have the best of times with this game one word amazing
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Best in the series so far.  I can't wait to see where Gideon and Eva's journey takes them next.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is the best!! its really big on the kindle &amp; I use it all the time!!! I especially like the way it show you the last thing you did below!!! A MUST HAVE!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Really happy about parts of this book...but really!?  Why end it like that!  Now we have to wait for what?  Months again!?  Please stop doing this to us Silvia Day.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|really great concert had seen bits of it before on public television .. but the entire show more then met our expectations
B0010SEMP0|5.0|What else can I say but that once again Jeaniene Frost pulls you into the strong and independent, Cat's world of sexy and powerful vampires.  Such a great story and development of characters that you really can't get enough of.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok i can not wait for the update for the nabi the update came out allready for my ipod ipad and my galaxy s 3 so ya
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved this book! It's one of his best books! I could not put it down! It reminded me of the notebook, but it was 10X better then the notebook!
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|good old fashioned mob movie. loved it. If you're a fan of Sopranos this movie is for you! 2 thumbs up for me!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. It's fun how you can build different stuff and explore new worlds. It's truly a game for almost everyone!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I loved Bared and Reflected these books had a plot. However, Reflected didn't seem to have one and once you thought it would it jumped all over the place...  I was wondering how this story was going to be stretched out to 5 books, well now I know.  This book just didn't have the wow factor like the other ones did.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it's a great game. I'm not going to lie I play it all day with my brother. I'm a gamer girl. I have a tiny little problem that it's not updating right away. It takes a while.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|This band perfectly fits my musical preference for melody and thoughtful lyric writing.  To me it seems like music Jackson Browne would have written when he was younger and putting out those classic albumns.  In fact, selecting the latest two Dawes records and the first 4 Jackson Browne albums and then hitting random mix can generate some nice juxtaposition of tunes.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|You cant change the color or find out how long you can perform an action!!! I would not get this app if i was you.
B005GIS1WA|2.0|Same old story about how a pet gets lost from its beloved owner, falls in love and also learns to fly just in the nick of time. I was so surprised. Not to mention some questionable content that isn't exactly \\"family friendly\\". At least there were a few laughs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome. People this app is the best ever.you will love and like this app forever until you die.
B001ED7C58|5.0|It's great to hear the full version of all of the songs. Love all of the songs, especially Suppermassive and Bella's Lullaby.
B00BDSRKHO|3.0|I have the same reaction to OMD's new English Electric, and the previous History of Modern:  a couple interesting songs worth listening to several times, and several forgettable tunes.  On EE, the catchiest song is Metroland, which I believe is the first single released.  Many of the other songs are &#34;Let's Try To Do Dazzle Ships Again, But Not As Edgy&#34;.  Between the last two albums, there are four or five songs worth putting on a greatest hits collection, but I'm probably waiting in vain for something like the beginning-to-end magnificence of Architecture and Morality.<br /><br />Having been to their concert near Detroit in 2011, and reading some of their interviews, I feel like in many ways the band doesn't understand why they are popular.  It isn't all the electropop sounds and the dance tunes that attracted fans like me back in the 1980's.  I think it was some of the angst and the moodiness on the one hand (She's Leaving, Stanlow, Was It Something I Said), and the over-the-top zaniness on the other (Telegraph, Tesla Girls, Enola Gay).  If there was a producer out there who could get them to see that, we could see one more fabulous album from them.
1439153663|5.0|My book club read this book and found it very enlightening.<br />The author keeps you engaged with the various characters.
B00BPXKWGS|5.0|The 25th Anniversary series that REM has been releasing of the early albums has been fantastic, the additional disk of a live concert has yet to disappoint!  And it continues to show how much of a vital cog Bill Berry was to the band, this is REM at their best, not the band you slowly came to despise over the years after Berry left the band.  Great songs, great concert disk, get this one!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Everyone knows the story, but if you haven't read the book, then you should probably read it.  A good, long read.
B00BDSRBXM|4.0|Ok, this is a great album, just a tiny step below The History of Modern, but what we are reviewing here is the deluxe set.  What's deluxe about it?  It has a bonus DVD with it.  On the DVD is a decent interview with Paul and Andy, sadly no interview with the other two members that Paul and Andy insist are vital to the band, let them talk guys!  Also is a track by track guide to the songs, and some animations that I'm not real sure why they are there.  So does  this DVD make it worth the extra $5-10 bucks?  Not really, but if you are a true OMD fan, you've stopped reading by now and have already bought the bonus set.  That's fine, the boys can use the extra money!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Okay the whole reason I became Obsessed with romance and started writing reviews was because of this series as well as FSOG. I won't bother making comparisons cause really it's the same genre but still two different stories.. But this one.. Ummmm it has it's Pro's and Cons... I'll be brief cause I don't like lengthy reviews.. So Pro's- it's Gideon and Eva come on!!! Do I need to say anymore?! There are still the same characters and the story lines are carrying on... The book LITERALLY picks up where reflected in you leaves off! Yeah! Their love story evolves and even has an interesting twist I wasn't expecting but understood. It's almost like you are so deep into someone's story that it doesn't have to be good after a while just as long as you can keep reading (eg, Twilight). A con and this made me give it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5... I didn't like that they were soooo needy for each other! It was a love story at first with a strong and fierce woman and a mogul who seemed unreachable so it was cool to read about both of them breaking down but this one?!! Omg! Gideon became a Sap at times and Eva couldn't move or think without affirmation from Gideon.. Really?!!! Now that there's more to come I understand Sylvia Day had to develop this relationship carefully and completely for their story to carry on.... Okay I'm done but overall it's good and now the long WAIT for the next one whenever and whatever it may be... Btw.. I love Cary and all other characters still!!!!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is a heart-wrenching story of the ravages of Alzheimer's told through the eyes of the person suffering the disease.
B00000JY1X|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Stephin Merritt.  Great musician and I think this is the best album of his that I've heard... even if the... largest.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome it has so many different options to play and earn many coins and powerups.is is awesome
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Original and extremely well written...  It's hard to put down and every character is captivating.  It makes you hate characters and love characters...  Worth reading...
B00B2QG3K2|4.0|Great album. I was impressed with how the whole album was different a lot of dynamics are in the piece. My only complaint is how it was mixed. I understand its pop punk rock whatever emphasize the bass but geeze. Other than that I was pleased common themes through out. Music is very catchy.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|My least favorite Justin Timberlake album. Was super stoked when i heard the first hit, Suit and Tie, to buy the album.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|It was really funny but not what I first expected.  I would recomed it to someone looking for a spagetti western!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Game is lots of fun and can make any boring point in your day fun!! I would recommend this game to everyone
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Really like the Eagles . Great DVD They have been a favorite for a long time . My daughter like it as well !!!!!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I read this book because I was suppose to be named Ramson Riggs if I was born a male.  I couldn't believe there was an author by that name.  The idea of having a home for peculiar children hidden from the world which strange powers is interesting.  I don't think I would recommend the book.  The old photographs added reality to the fiction and was a good touch.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I just happened on this I thought it was awesome. Couldn't put it down till my battery died. Looking forward to the next room.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An awsome game but i would gave 5 star SaaS but i didnt because it wont let me connect to my facebook account please fix.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Although I expected a trilogy, glad to see that Gideon & Eva's story will continue.<br /><br />My cons...<br />Felt that Gideon's background wasn't well developed.  Yes, we learned a bit more about his struggles, but after 2 books, expected that we would get the full story behind his turmoil.<br /><br />SD's style of writing changed in this book.<br /><br />Although I do love my smut, most of this book detailed G & E's every sexual encounter--seemed as if SD was trying to fill pages.<br /><br />In the end, just feeling as if Sylvia Day is trying to compete with the 50 Shades trilogy :(
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I've only watched 7 or 8 episodes, but I am HOOKED!  I can't wait to see what happens next in this great little town with all these cute motorcycle boys.....
B0065GC0BA|5.0|You have got to read this amazing story of finding love where you least expect it....but bring your tissues.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book and couldnt put it down. It was beautiful! The author writes with a very easy reading style. I will definitely be reading more of her books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Please update minecraft just please but I like the game minecraft and update it it would get more reviews and people would like it more for Amazon
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|Not even fun for a match 3 game. I have no idea what all the fuss is about. Deleted Uninstalled.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. I like the sci-fi universe and the overall story arc for the main character. It's well-written, inventive story telling that kept me very engaged. It's a great, quick read for anyone who loves sci-fi.
B00992CF6W|5.0|From an 11-year-old:<br />This game is an awesome game that everyone has to get!  If your concerned that it might be a waste of your money then I'll tell you right now that it's not, so get it!  I promise its worth every penny. Hope you enjoyed this reveiw.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Small puzzle game, big fun! Well animated, and great design. Would highly encourage a download to try! Love the mumble of the jelly ;-)
B009NY43NY|2.0|Past couple years...I was dedicated reader and finished this series. I was very disappointed , hope to see something more to finish the story...there was not.... Good by Sookie Stackhouse, I am done it!
B001P06GX4|5.0|Even my 6 yo daughter can understand how to play this game - makes you think ahead several moves and form strategies to block other players from putting down their pieces on the board. Highly recommend 6 years and up!
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I'm giving 4 stars only because the phone feels really rough from all around the case. It came on its box all pretty and on time(im a prime member anyway) and as soon as I took it out I noticed it was all perfect. No scratches, no dirt no nothing but yeah it feels soooo rought!!!! I hope my hands get use to it after a couple days. I also hope what I read about the lines on the back plate doesn't happen to me, it would really suck if my phone got those lines printed on its back. (I have a back screen protector though so hopefully this won't happen) overall great case for its price. One more thing, I love it that this case actually protects all around the sides and edges of the front screen so I'm sure if I dropped it I wouldn't get any dented edges.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so excited when this book came out...I couldn't wait to read it.  But unfortunately I was left wanting...  The first half of the book is just sex and telling each other `I love you' etc.  Finally, when it felt like some plot was going to occur the book was over...with a note from the author that the story isn't over and I'll have to wait for more to come...WTF?
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I have loved this book since it first appeared. I have an old paperback, yellow with age, that I try to read at least once each year. They just don't make them like this any more.
B0051XSKSU|5.0|Jack Black puts his own unique quirkiness in this cute animated movie about a panda who's life's dream is to become a kung fu master.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|Man best bud had this back in the day...it was like a rediscovered treasure for me...great album that brought back many great memories....
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|If you have watched the book you will be happy with all the most important events are there, plus some that were not in the book but found in other books (that is a little weird but they did incorporate it really well)  Only disappointing thing is it is not the entire book and there are still two more movies before it we see the end...
B000002KYR|5.0|I love ZZ Top! I have many of their CD's. Now, another to add! I'm just an old hippie and enjoy Rock n Roll! Good quailty!
B0014GVCI8|5.0|Loved it, not the stereotypical plot for a romantic comedy and the focus family in it was more real than a lot of other romantic comedies out there.
B001NA6096|1.0|I am not sure what possessed the screenwriter at the time he wrote this. Literally, what demon possessed him. I can only guess it was the soul of some really angst-out teenager who was trying to release every word he had learned up to the point of his being taken by that Great Director in the sky.  If you have broken through puberty, do not watch this movie.  If you are brain dead, do not watch this movie.  Although, if you're brain dead, you could possibly wake up and throw a shoe at your TV.  I understand Guantanamo prisoners stopped their food strike after they were threatened with having to watch &#34;BEFORE SUNRISE&#34; just once.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I am always hesitant of Disney movies as they always have the same plot every time and the story lines are not creative at all!  But this movie blew my socks off, and no wonder... the creator of Pixar produced it.  Disney is getting smarter, they should have never of let him go!
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|It does exactly what I need it to do - connect a Firewire to USB.  Now I can use my second backup drive.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|This is a beautiful, inspiring movie from a tragedy of colossal proportions. It's impossible not to cry almost continually: tears of heartbreak and tears of relief.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is one of the best games I have on my kindle fire. I love how it was Tokyo but then it just changed to Miami.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Wonderful ending to the trilogy. Skillfully written and a must read. Perfect trilogy for those seeking a steamy romance. May have to read the series again in the future!
B00962341U|1.0|I am so disappointed...which seems to be a growing tradition when it comes to video games, music, and movies. I don't know what is going on? Are people getting so rich they think that they think they can just put out garbage to say they did something so they can go back to there rich and bragging lifestyles and that we won't notice. What happens when we stop buying your stuff, and all that money runs out. Where will you be then?<br /><br />Leona Lewis is one of my favorite artist, I am a fan and I write this with nothing but love and respect, but this album is complete garbage. I went back and listened to her old stuff wondering what the people were saying when they reviewed that this one is better then the last two, and upon careful inspection I say those people are nuts. This album is sloppy, uninspired, and shouldn't be called Leona Lewis. She doesn't even sing in this album, like Christina, Mariah Carey, and a lot of good singers who feel they can put out a album without singing and a lot of autotune.<br /><br />I mean was it that the old songs were written by someone else, and Leona Lewis own stuff is crap. I mean what happened to this album, no singles, did she self produce it. Where are all the grammy award winning producers, because it surley doesn't feel like there was a single one working on this album. I mean the music is uninspired, talking about anything important or relevent I mean is this even Leona Lewis. What is going on? I thought she was going to be the next Mariah, but going like this she won't be the next Britney Spears. I mean where is the Bleeding Love, Can't Breathe, and all the other beautiful music I know she is capable of doing?<br /><br />Reviewing this as a product, I would say don't buy it, skip it and wait for the next album (lets hope that is better,) and go back to the others ones or purchase those.<br /><br />I really don't know what Leona was thinking putting her name behind something like this. I don't know what's going on with her career but it is not looking too good. Maybe she should shop around, I mean she is Leona Lewis.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book (or set of books), was quite the ride. It started off with what appeared to be an innocuous start but infected you with questions that had to be answered....only with more questions. Its only drawback was a bit of a lull between a couple plot points. I'll be looking forward to reading my next Howdy novel if they are all as unexpected as this.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Overall production values are reasonably high so the movie was appealing to the senses.  There are several scenes where the special effects are quite lame, but they did not significantly spoil the watching experience.<br /><br />My wife enjoyed it because of the above and the fact that the main character was a strong female.<br /><br />I think the technology of the hunger games world as mostly a straight-forward extrapolation of what is already feasible, but their society was not at all believable, so I never really identified with the characters or their plight.  The excessive weirdness of some of the support characters just reinforced my feelings of remoteness from the movie.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't watch it for myself, but my wife liked it and I could watch it together with her.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Nice pictures, good time waster, fun.<br />I like that you're able to download other puzzles.<br />It doesn't seem to have any glitches yet!
1439170916|5.0|Dr. Mukherjee is a talented author. He combines history and mythology related to cancer while interjecting his interpersonal stories of patients and their experiences with various forms of cancer in a very interesting style.
B000005TRO|4.0|It was an amazing thing just to find it through amazon.com, nobody else had it. just that complete 1/2 of my expectations. It a great album and clear sound.
B00005NGAL|5.0|so it got this for my birthday like 2 years ago and I love it so much and I have loved this musical for as long as I can remember and the 2nd disk had so much more content than any other edition or website could tell me because it was in a easy way to get to my mom actuly sat in the backseat when we went for a long drive to watch it with me!
0553593714|5.0|Could not put it down!  In depth genealogy.  Maps are a big  plus to help you relate to where the action is taking place.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The story about race, slavery, family love and loyalty was compelling.  I found the story uplifting despite the hardships and brutality endured by its characters.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I understand that the developers of minecraft have their hands full of other versions of minecraft, like the Xbox 360 version and the very well known pc version, but, it seems like this version falls so short. I can do so much more on even my Xbox than I can on this version, and they even update their other versions more than this one. Although, it is fair to say this is a work in progress, it has been a very long one. I'm not saying I don't enjoy playing minecraft. I'm saying that if you want something closer to the computer version, just look up other craft, mine or block games in the app store. You can find a much better replacement for the pc or Xbox version for (believe it or not) much cheaper. You can find something better to use until this game updates to become the same as the versions that got the game its well known title.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This is a fun game. I have watch my kids play it and they get super excited about it. I like that you can change it from moving the shark with your finger vs. moving it by tilting the device you are playing it on.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm thinking about switching to Apple because the updates are never on time get them out on time people but all in all the game is cool.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love the Ebay App. I was so happy to see that my Kindle Fire was able to get this app. Makes my life much easier
B0087YYHZU|4.0|It's Singing in the Rain.  It's a classic.  What more can I say?  If you know nothing about this movie, then there are many sites that can give you the synopsis.  As my header reads, this is a review on the blu-ray only.<br /><br />I felt that the visual quality could be better, but I'm not sure what was the source for the blu-ray transfer.  I'm also not interested in researching that information on the web.  For instance, I have the movie Zulu on blu-ray.  That transfer is spectacular.  Granted I know that Singing in the Rain was filmed in 1952 and Zulu was twelve years later which may account for the difference in transfer.  However, when compared to the dvd released in 2002, the blu-ray is remarkably superior.  I did a comparison using the same machine and the colors are warmer.  It's like the colors in the dvd were faded somehow.  I also believe that the sound is even more brilliant.  Singing in the Rain was shot in 1:33 and there's no way to make it widescreen.  If you think you are being cheated because yours didn't come in widescreen, don't be.  The original never was, and I would personally be offended with a pan-and-scan release just to satisfy the widescreen wanters.  Don't get me wrong, I love widescreen, but this film simply never was.<br /><br />So, is it worth it to purchase yet another copy of this same great classic?  VHS to dvd to blu-ray?  Absolutely.  I won't buy whatever comes after blu-ray, but this is/was a worthwhile purchase.  Very glad I did.  I only give it 4 stars because I wish the transfer were still a bit more cleaner.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Lets me start auctions right from my iPhone! Much better than using the mobile version of ebay where you can't start auctions.
1781162646|2.0|Perhaps the bar is just too damn high for long time fans of King (like me).  While \\"JL\\" begins with great promise, the book stumbles early and does not recover.  The resolution of the ghost story is flimsy and frustrating; the climatic scene on the \\"Carolina Spin\\" is ludicrous, even allowing for deliberate melodrama in this \\"hard-boiled\\" crime novel.  Mike, the child with the gift of sight, is every bit as annoying as King's other similarly gifted characters in, among others, The Shining, The Langoliers, and The Stand.  King will keep writing, and I will keep reading...and waiting.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I felt it was a waste of my time------decent writing, well thought out but not a fun book for me.
B00CWVFZ8W|2.0|Gratuitous profanity that does not enhance the story line. The plot does not follow the actual book's storyline. The book was better.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is great for passing time.  If you are waiting for an appointment or a bus, etc.  It will keep you occupied and make you laugh.
B008602KQI|5.0|Katniss is a badass! Starts slow but turns into an awesome movie! Enjoyed this movie very much.  Watch it today!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The game is addictive, reasonable challenging.  I wished it had more levels of game play because I didn't want to stop.  I am excited for number 2
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game.... easy to play... always loads, gives you a fair chance to win when doing the random deal. good game
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love this series, very funny. Got this very quickly with no problems. Very good price for the three together.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I really appreciate the research that went into writing this book.  It has been over 70 years since WWII began and most of the brave men and women who fought in the war are now passing on.  It is important to preserve as much of the first hand accounts of history so that it can accurately be passed on to future generations.  This is a story of remarkable courage under extreme duress and active fire.  It illustrates how dynamic the human spirit is and what can be accomplished if fear does not overwhelm the soul.<br /><br />Great book, great research, great story!<br /><br />Kevin Kirkpatrick
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Pudding monaters is the best game from zepto lab that is not cut the rope or cut the rope time traveler or even experiments. Very fun to play for a long period of time.
B008133MDK|4.0|Benedict Cumberpatch is awesome as sSherlock. John Watson is also casted well. The story lines are clever. Some of them are too much like a horror movie for my taste and not as much like action, like I'd like.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|after cut the rope you have come to excepect great things from zeptolab and this game is that! fun, simple, and cool looking :)
B000JMKO0A|5.0|He has entered a dark world here by shedding light on a tabo subject. Even when Maria is confronted by her first SM encounter he handles it with such insight and sensetivty that you just about get it. You understand................... My First Coelho read ws the Alchemist and I found it life changing.
0425263924|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two books and I was waiting quite patiently for the third.  While I am not upset that there will be more books because I do love the characters, I am upset that it seems like because of that decision this third book kinda well wasn't as good as it could have been.  It felt like a half of what it may have been.  I was expecting to hear more about Gideons life and issues but we only got bits and pieces of that.  It seemed like everything in this book happened in a day, well I guess it was 2 weeks.  All in all I will read the next one, but I hope it gets back to the feel of the first two books.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I think it is great it is a good thinking game I have a 11 year old who loves it and a 7 year old who can play it with a little help. I think this is a great game play it
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I first used it to at my daughters suggestion,  I picked a character from a foreign (Scandinavian) book, and it guessed it.  I was surprised.  The Genie is good.  Try it for yourself.
0316223239|3.0|I was definitely engrossed in the book. However, I feel this a story that should of been written by someone else. No offense to the author, She did a great job and portrayed a believable story. But with the light of what recently occurred in Ohio and the infamous Jaycee Duggard story, I feel like it would of been better perceived if it was their book. This is the first book that I've read by this author and in the middle of reading it, I hoped it was her telling her own story. In the book, the lawyer even tells &#34;ma&#34; she should write a book before someone else beats her to it. Didn't Emma Donoghue do the same thing? Didn't she &#34;steal&#34; someone else's story? Ok, maybe I am being too critical. And if I just want the story from the actual person, I should just read Jaycee Duggard's book. Overall, the book was ok.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This charger does exactly what you need it to do. Pretty simple. I've had it two weeks thus far and not an issue. The magnetized tip is great and is similar to Mac chargers that also employ magnetic technology.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|the worlds first superhero.<br />even after all these years Captain America remains to be one of my all-time favorites ranking in my top five with The Dark Knight,<br />Superman, Iron Man  and The Incredible Hulk!<br />did a perfect justice to the story of the hero's origin.<br />I love this movie!
B00CW665VI|3.0|This book will make your eyes roll with this guy's very disturbing and obnoxious view of the opposite sex to think that he is a whore himself disguise as a rich, over the top loving uncle.  Then it will make you wince with all the cheesiness only found in movies! Really?! I don't dislike it, I finished this book in one sitting but gosh, do girls really dig this type of guys
B001C08RHA|5.0|what's not to love?,<br />Robert Downey Jr. in the best and most iconic role of his career.<br />the most epic superhero in all Marvel history.<br />how can you not love Iron Man?
B008476HBM|5.0|...she's a genius. I love all her book P&P is my favorite. Persuasion is 2nd, S&S 3rd, & Emma 4th...& the rest have equal footing.
B001DHXT2U|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE!<br />if you ask me, the 2003 ang lee Hulk was an eye sore.<br />this newer 2008 version was a much needed improvement!,<br />I love it!
B0069JBKHI|2.0|Before we purchased the Withing Baby Monitor, we did a ton of research on different consumer sites. It came down to the Withings versus a Foscam IP camera. We ended up deciding on the Withings monitor because it was essentially an IP camera built up to be a baby monitor. There were a lot of great features like the ability to play songs, the night light, and night vision. Plus it was compatible for both Apple and Android products (very important since we have both). If you watch the demo video on the Withings web page, the resolution is great during the day. Night vision also looks very clear. Can't go wrong with this purchase right?<br /><br />The camera arrives, and I go to download the app on my Android. The Google Play store tells me \\"device not compatible\\". Okay, well let me try my tablet. It has a different version of the Android OS so it should work.. \\"device not compatible\\". After scouring their website I did find a buried link to an Android app. It works on my tablet, but crashes on my phone. Things are not starting off well.<br /><br />We test out the video. I have the camera on in a decently lit room. My wife is on the couch maybe six feet away from the camera, and I can barely see her. The pinch to zoom works, but all I get is a garbled pixelated mess. There was also close to an 8-10 second lag. This was over Wi-Fi, and I know my network isn't congested. I plugged the camera into my gigabit LAN just to see if it was any better. It was not.<br /><br />I'm still really trying to find a reason to like this product. We turn off all the lights and test the night vision. You cannot see anything. Night vision does not work at all. The only things that did seem to work on the monitor were the lullaby's, and night light. But with a $250 price tag, I really need more out of my device.<br /><br />We returned the device and purchased a Foscam FI8910W IP camera. At less than $90, it does everything I need and more. Of course it does require a little bit more know howin setting up versus the Withings monitor, but it really is well worth it. Lag time is virtually unnoticeable. The clarity of the video is excellent. There are apps available for both Android and Apple. And the night vision is amazing. I can zoom in on a picture on my wall while it's pitch black and make out the lettering.<br /><br />In summary, I hope this helps someone out in the future. I went into this really hoping for an amazing product, and just could not be more let down. I saved a ton of money with another product, and it works.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Just what I needed another fast paced addictive game. Keeps you on your toes and passes the time.  Love it.  Many people will enjoy taking a break for a quick game. Lots of fun for all ages.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Read the first two books of the trilogy and can't wait for the third which is probably a year away.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Slows. down sometimes, but that's my tablet. An ad before each game, but are given the chance to x out quickly.  Worth it.
0810989956|5.0|We volunteer to tutor and mentor children in our area in a special after school program. I bought one book for a special child I was working with and the other children love the series, but had not seen this particular book. So I bought 19 more so every kid in our program could have their own during the summer.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I loved this book. Best of the series and The Red Wedding broke my heart, I love these characters and I cannot wait to read the next two
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love the fourth and fifth movie. People should buy this product because it saves a lot of time on having to buy each one separately.
1885167776|5.0|An amazingly simple concept that Gary Keller has taught and lived by for years!  Very easy to read and will change how you think about your life every day!  Pam J
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I enjoyed the movie to the story line, and if you view the movie in which you could see that things could become that bad, just open your mind and see. how would you survive ?.
B001OSIV62|5.0|This is a must see, bucket list, before you die movie. Doesn't matter what language you speak.  Simply Amazing.  The reality of what happened is way too good to spoil.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Wasn't as funny as Knocked Up, but I get it. It was entertaining. I really wish they gave the couple from Knocked Up  a cameo. Definitely had some laugh out loud points though.
0425263924|1.0|I pre-ordered back in oct. I'm beyond pissed that I waited so long for a book that's not even the last installment of a trilogy. TRILOGY MEANS 3 not 5. I will never know how it ends bc I refuse to buy another book.
B0045D3N3O|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. Not only is Malcom X a historical icon of mine, but Denzel play one of the best roles I've ever seen him act in. Spike Lee is a great director and actor. This is one of those movies where everything comes together.
B002AT8KCY|4.0|Why do you keep comparing action movies to life events? Why must there be a message in every novel that you watch? This was a good action packed flick with unbelievable effects but that's what they were.. Effects! Don't judge a good movie on things you know can not happen.. Did you snub your nose at Star trek or the Hobbit because it didn't satisfy your reality? Just watch it like you used to watch star wars or the texas chain saw massacre or even Les Mis&eacute;rables.. Life isn't a Broadway song so how come you liked that unreal story? Don't nag on an otherwise entertaining movie that was essentially good from beginning to end. I myself am not clouded with criticism (except toward those who are) I enjoyed this movie thank you very much.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|I understood the concept, just difficult to follow with soo many story lines. Tom Hanks, as always first class performance, along side Halle Berry, the cast was great.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|When I try to play level 3-1 on my kindle it automatically kills me. I downloaded it on my  daughters kindle to and it kills you on the same level. Please, do an update to resolve this because I absolutely love both of the leps world games.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I liked the app at first, but my brother has it for ipad and there is an update out, he got it so now we cant play in the same world because there is no update on the kindle app
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I see that there's another review title named 'Wow'. That's ok. This deserves more than one.<br /><br />Quell Memento continues the awesome puzzles from the first two Quell games and adds some neat new gameplay to the series. Wow.<br /><br />I remember seeing both games on the Amazon Free Ap list and thinking \\"Damnit! I paid a dollar for those .... hang on a sec. I would've paid more than that for the enjoyment this game has.\\" So, if you're cheap (or poor), this one may be free in 4 or 5 months ... but after reading these reviews, why in tarnation would you want to wait? Get. Game. Now.<br /><br />I haven't found the hidden puzzles or features yet, but the reviews and Facebook page mention them. I see a few features which seem 'extra', but they haven't led me to puzzles (or awards) yet.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This book has so much hype...and I expected greatness.  It was okay, but no where near greatness.  I think a pros/cons list is in order...<br /><br />Pros:<br />I liked pretty much all the characters.<br />I liked the college setting.<br />I liked the danger behind Travis' fighting.<br />I liked Travis and Abby's friendship first relationship.<br />I loved the sweet moments when Travis and Abby were falling in love/ when they were back together.<br />I loved Travis' family and America.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Hated the pacing.  It was off somehow.  It's hard to say exactly how, but it moved weird.<br />Hated all the breakups and make ups.<br />Hated the dysfunction.<br />Hated the epilogue.<br /><br />I think I would be happy with this story if it were about half as long.  It dragged and they broke up and reunited just a tad too much.  Some was okay...but by time #5 I was so over it.<br /><br />I'm rambling.  Bottom line... It's worth reading...I just don't think it's worth more than $2.99 or all the hype.
B007T7MIR0|4.0|So far so good, I'm able to view all of my files. I would recommend this software to other people. I'm not sure other people didn't like this software it has been great for me
0446573671|4.0|We read this for our book club and liked it so well, I order this one for my Mom in large print.  She is enjoying it now.  Good  memories with Nicholas Sparks.  Met him a few years ago in SC and took a pic with him and my Mom. She treasures it still at 94...
B00004XQP4|2.0|Well, this is just my personal opinion so please don't get mad at me..<br /><br />First off I love Green Day and always have but this album turned out to be a real bummer and not what I was expecting from them.<br /><br />To me the songs are so boring and lack the talent that they had in their last albums that truly got me going.<br /><br /> They did not put enough effort into this one like they did their last albums.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this as I can check on the weather where my daughter lives in Boston, and the surrounding area where I live here in Maine.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I enjoyed this 2nd book in the series but I do not believe that it compares to the original.  The drama of the love triangle just seems so wishy washy.  The main character seems to have no loyalty and can bounce back and forth between the male characters.  The main character started out so strong, but now seems to now not know her own mind.  I do think the book is worth reading and I hope the series goes back up from here.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This series gets better with every book. I have a feeling that this will be an explosive ending as well as a tender beginning.
B009R659L8|3.0|I love Mary Higgins Clark, but this felt a tad lazy as far as developing characters we really care about. I usually feel attached to someone in the story. Not this time. I gave it three stars because Clark never fails to hook you into wanting to find out who the real culprit is. I hope her next effort steps it up a bit.
B005ES0XQY|4.0|I like these much better than the WalMart brand.  Worth shelling the extrs $$$ for.  Fit perfect, so far very durable.  I tend to use my stuff hard, so I have been quite happy that they are seeming up to the task.  Good product.
B0063M22QO|2.0|I thought it was going to be more excitiing, more of a 3-D style. When you get to last level, you have to keep paying for the next level. Not worth it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome, I have been waiting for it to be on the Kindle for the LONGEST time eve
B004V2S4SS|4.0|I like Medium very much!! I'm into tv shows and movies that are very interesting, like dramas, some comedys and the paranormal.

B00CM96A60|5.0|I Love this album. Armin Vanbuuren is one of the best and never lets you down. He is a master at his craft!
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Not a bad game. RTS type feel to it. Doesn't require you to use real money though that option is available.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is an excellent time-killer, and actually presents a pretty decent challenge. You can spend hours unlocking everything, or be lame and buy it all for real money.
B0042816YK|5.0|I have waited a long time to see this movie. Julia Roberts does it again. She is the perfect actress.

B008WCP2PG|5.0|I loved this movie. Had to share it with many of my friends. Just wish I could move like the guys in the movie
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|action packed, suspenseful, conniving, vindictive what more could you want form a show on cable.  Cast is great, wish it were still on
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is very entertaining, never boring. It is difficult, but not stressful. It is one of my favorite games. Better than Temple Run.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like this app. it keeps u. hooked. you will love it I injoy it to much. you get to build up your truck as you progress.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is so fun, but it does not have as much stuff as the pc version.
0425263924|5.0|Just finished reading Entwined with You.  After receiving the book on Tuesday I wanted to find a block of uninterrupted time in order to sit and enjoy this anxiously awaited book which looked like it was going to be this weekend.  However, after taking a look at some of the reveiws (and thank you to those of you who let us know if you have written information that might spoil the read for the rest of us) and reading some of the less than positive reviews I decided to just jump in and find time to read sooner.  I fell in love with this series by chapter two of Bared to You.  That said, Sylvia continues to develop the main characters:  Gideon and Eva.  I love these characters!  And, that is due to a writer that knows how to develop characters.  I have found myself in tears during parts of each of the first three books as I cheered for Gideon and Eva through their self discovery, challenges, triumphs, heartbreak and growing love.  Chapter 19 of EWY...what can I say but love, love, love.  In fact, loved the entire book. Plan to re-read this weekend.  Yes, I want more too, and sooner rather than later. Maybe that is what the negative reviewers have really been trying to say:  Give us more.  Thank you Sylvia for these characters.  You truly have a gift for bringing fictional characters to life.  Keep it coming.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a fun free to play game. It allows you to create anything you want. I have it on all of the editions Xbox pc and pocket edition. I recommend this game  from ages 5 to any age because it has mobs that might scare little ones.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I had always wanted to ready this, didn't quite know what it was about...sort of creepy, mysterious, thought provoking...on severeal levels..<br />Karen P.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This calculator has a far superior interface than the \\"stock\\" app that arrived on a Sprint HTC EVO LTE. Nice high contrast display; presumably it does accurate mathematical calculations!<br /><br />Nice ad-free calculator.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We got this for my daughter, she always plays it on my husbands phone when we are out. She loves it.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I can not use all the functions on the Kindle with this app. It's OK for viewing but I have to use my computer for anything other than that.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|This was a good movie, with lots of action. worth renting. Not my favorite Die Hard, but Bruce Willis is still great!
143353083X|4.0|I love the ESV Study Bible but I had to exchange it for a larger size as the print was too small for me to read.
0307474259|5.0|Turns the establishments arguments upside down!!  A great read if you are serious about weight loss and your health. Compelling!!
B004U7MQYC|5.0|This is a good continuation of the Highlander movies although it does kill off Chistopher Lambert to provide for the completion of the plot.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Obvious the author ended this book midway through. I'm assuming so she can draw out the series. This book was not worth $10.
B0047SF41G|4.0|Again a different take on the predator series of movies having the combatants dropped into and alien world as punishment for thier crimes.
B00AEBB9FU|3.0|I wasn't really that impressed with this movie.  I though with George Clooney being the lead character it would be a good story at least.  But I found it very slow to start and overall it didn't keep me engaged in the story like a good movie does.  I am glad I saw it, just wish I would not have bought it.  Obviously I didn't see it before I bought it.  I found this movie to be one of those I like to say - sure glad I saw it but really seeing it is good enough because I would not watch this one again and again.
075640407X|5.0|Great story with lots of detail that makes it so interesting.  Hope he writes a lot more - excellent writer.  Hope he doesn't stop with a trilogy . . .
B002VPE1WK|3.0|With my battery grip attached which it is always attached. It seems to still stick out to the point where it wants to pop out and I would have to pull up the zipper edge to keep it in place. It should be a little more taller to support the deep height of the camera with battery grip. This size bag is pro size and should reflect such.
B002XXPNXG|1.0|Very disappointed after seeing Before Sunrise and enjoying it so much. The entire sequel seemed forced, the characters were no longer likable, nor relatable. The dialogue was grating. Ethan Hawke appeared gaunt and unattractive, and by the end, so did Julie Delpy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end. I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and I am glad I did. Amazing story & awesome book. I absolutely loved it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a happy funny and sometimes tear bringing story. It really is amazing. I'd recommend to people who like Sharon Creech and Lois Lowry books!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this game mojang and the updates already out for IOS so why isn't it out for kindle yet?! Sorry for complaining I just wanted to get that off my chest. Otherwise great job but u need to have Caves and Redstone. That is all :D
0385349831|1.0|First one of Mr. Coelho's books I didn't like. Perhaps where I am at this time...? Maybe. But all I could think was \\"Too much. Too much. TOO MUCH!\\" It was overwhelming. Too many words. Too much 'wisdom'. Too many contradictions in 'advice' from Copt. It felt 'desperate' - from Copt and from the author.<br /><br />No matter what the question from the people regarding their untenable situation or the catastrophy about to befall them, \\"when blood will be soon be running down every street in the city\\", some hopeful, simplistic,  'bright way to look at it' was given...presumably for the reader to take to heart regarding their own life circumstances.  I'm sure Mr. Coelho meant well - but the endless list of 'positive thinking' cliches became impossible to read. As a matter of fact, for me, it was. I finally had to put it down.<br /><br />I'm sure loyal readers of his work (of which I still am) will pay no attention to my negativity. And that is as it should be. But I was so disappointed I wished to give it voice. I think I'll go back and reread the ones I have loved.
B000005B0U|1.0|CD would not play on home player nor in car player.  It was returned 3 weeks ago.  Do your divisions not communicate with each other?

B0085YOD1A|5.0|Keeps me from running out of power at important times! And it is very easy to track power while using my Kindle.
B006RXPUR2|5.0|A terrific story well played and presented.  It will leave you mulling over a not so black and white decisions.  Lots of tension and intrigue.  And Afflect has the heart beat of his home state Mass.  Where does he get his cast!? Very creative.  Highly recommend
B00005NB0H|4.0|This is one of those albums that shows what a great live act should sound like, even on old technology. Granted, I prefer Isle of Wight, but this is a great recording. Having all of Tommy on one disc is great. That is one thing that Isle of Wight has against it, the performance of Tommy is divided on the two discs. Yes, I know that was the sequence of the performance, but it's nice to pop in one CD and hear a collection of singles or Tommy. The best solution is to own both Live at Leeds and Isle of Wight, which I do. This is one collection that any true Who fan should own.
B00CMAK34O|5.0|My ears are now as happy as my eyes when it comes to Agnetha Faltskog.  Great songs. Beautiful arrangement easy listening.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Fast and furious game play - simple controls! Only problem - no way to pause the game or exit that I could find!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this book! The plot was very unpredictable and great sequel to the first. It's a great series
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I had the free version so when this one came up as FAOTD, I snagged it! I really like that you can combine and make you own custom sounds. Some sounds are not really relaxing - at least to me (City Ambience and Vacuum for instance).
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app a lot better than the pro version because it's simple and to the point. I also love how you can pick the battery color and you can't when you go pro
B00A7W29BE|3.0|Really setup for a tablet or such that has a camera on the back. My test scan ended up reversed and there was no way to change that. Probably more a problem with me and the tablet but...
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I like this app but it would be better if you could pick the battery color. I do like how it tells you the health of your device.that is always a good feature
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Perfect. It is pure perfection. It is made of perfection. Best game ever please make a fifth. But still it comes clone to bacon but not close enough.
0525457585|2.0|I decided to read this book because I grew up on the 1984 film of the same name. Though we're talking about child actors in the eighties and the dazzling special effects of the by-gone era, it's still one of my favorite films today, mostly for one reason: the writing is AWESOME! It's the kind of show that makes me think, No wonder I'm a writer, and a romantic, and an idealist, who loves to write all kinds of epic drama! I grew up on this show!<br /><br />Anyway, I saw that it came from a book and decided I wanted to read it, just to see what differences there were and to revel even more in a story I love.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book was very hard to read. It's not because the writing is bad or the author sucked, but rather because it was originally written in German and so the English version is a translation. I wouldn't describe the translation as choppy so much as written in completely passive voice. It's reminiscent of Tolkien or C.S. Lewis at their worst. Despite an interesting, ridiculously unique story, the way it's written is just plain boring, which made it a difficult book to get through.<br /><br />Comparing it with the film, the entirety of the movie takes place in the first half of the book. That's right! They left out fully half the novel. But that's probably because, being geared toward kids, they only had ninety minutes to work with. Everything that happened in the film was almost spot-on with the book, though. Bastian was a fat, bullied kid, which (the fat part anyway) wasn't true in the film. Near the end of the film (don't worry, this isn't a spoiler; just a last line) it says something along the lines of, \\"Bastian made many wishes and had many more amazing adventures. But that's another story...\\" Basically, the second half of the book comprises all the adventures he had in Fastastica. (The film changes it to Fantasia. A film after my own heart. :D)<br /><br />Many of the adventures drag on, while a few of them are very intriguing. I especially liked one of the final ones where he met an old, blind minor who collect glass plates from his mine. The plates held the dreams of human beings from the world. He explains to Bastian that when you wake and don't remember your dream, it becomes entombed in the mine. When the minor collected them, they became part of Fantastica. Bastian has to go looking for one of his own dreams, because he's lost all of his human memories by that point, and the only way to get back to the real world is to remember some part of who he was. I thought it was a very interesting, touching story.<br /><br />The book ended on a very sweet note, as well, with an improvement in the relationship between Bastian and his father. This is something I would have appreciated in the film, as they went out of their way to show how rocky things were between the two, but never followed up on it.<br /><br />One other note: the film's writers were freakin' geniuses! There were so many lines I came across that were in the film, but slightly altered. Where they were profound and powerful in the movie, they fell flat in the book. Granted, it could be an issue of translation again, but from what I can tell, the writers took something that was mediocre, but had potential and made it something awe-inspiring.
B003QSO11W|1.0|Despite being a fan of John Cusak, I avoided seeing this film when it was released because of the horribly cliche premise based on a hitman. The world didn't need anymore stupid hitman movies back then than it does now. Renting this now I see that my judgment then was sound. Not only does it have the trite hitman premise but then it adds the hackneyed \\"going to a therapist\\" cliche. The diaglogue is bad. The poorly lit scenes are shot in the least engaging, most boring way possible. And the casting is horrible (John Cusak excepted) with Minnie Driver, the least attractive actress to consistently be miscast in the role of supposed-to-be-attractive romantic female lead. Watching this felt like watching bad TV when you're home with a fever.
B004PZ4HC8|3.0|This is another book that has a film version coming out this year, which was the main reason I want to read it. This book is kind of different in terms of it's format. It's set up like a pseudo-documentary; a journalist interviewing different people about their zombie apocalypse experiences and what insight their individual expertise and views can lend the catastrophe.<br /><br />Many of them work high-up jobs as politicians, influential scientists and physicians, etc., while others are just laymen and everyday joes. While we just listen to interesting (sometimes horrific) stories of people's experiences and it feels like we're just watching 20/20, he actually gives us a very well-rounded idea of the events and timeline of the zombie outbreak on a world-wide scale.<br /><br />All that said, I have to admit I didn't end up being a huge  fan of the format. It started out really interesting, but it just didn't work for me overall. Don't get me wrong, I get why people loved this and it was a best-seller, but I found myself getting bored. First of all, the book begins by basically saying that the zombie apocalypse is over and the world, though in ruins, did survive and is starting to rebuild. Though it's a common thing to do, I'm never a fan of telling the ending first. Yeah, in fiction it gives you an end point to work toward, but I'd always rather be surprised. In this particular novel it was even worse because this wasn't formatted like a regular story. All the short stories put together never had a common thread or character, so there was no character to root for and no climax to work toward; nothing you wanted to see play out based on the information given at the beginning.<br /><br />Because of that, like I said, I got bored and had a hard time finishing it. I think the movie looks fun--hopefully I won't be disappointed there as well--and I'm glad I read it to get an idea of what it was, even if I did just skim large chunks of it. If the format sounds like something you'd like, then you probably will. For me, I doubt I'll pick this up again.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|epic tm is very fun and u own a castle and also fight army's. I just got the game and played a little bit and I love it
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Exactly what i was looking for and more. I love the quality of this product. Its worth every penny.It's durable and looks great. Convenient for side charging USB port.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|great rock record..Lizzy kind of a mix between Pat Benatar, Kelly Clarkson and Sebastian Bach (Skid Row) all rolled into one  girl is pretty freaking killer  especially considering all the crap out these days refreshing to hear a newer band rocking like this
B00992CF6W|4.0|My friend  she have a friend update there not<br />I'm mad<br />At that friend<br />Mad like to say mean  about her
B005LAIIJY|5.0|There wasn't a dull moment throughout the movie.  It exhibit a lot of action.  It showed we have come a long way.<br /><br />Thank you and have a nice weekend
B002ZG99IG|3.0|I knew it was when I grabbed it. I'm a big border/thriller fan so I grabbed it cause I could. Cheap and has that 're-watch value. Believe it was a used copy, perfect condition. Seller rating would be higher. L8
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This could have been an amazing ending to a great love story. Instead the book dragged on with little to no story to drag two more books. Sylvia Day lost this Crossfire fan.
B009DQQF7Y|5.0|After almost a decade - GYBE is back and in a same strength then before.<br />In short - excellent material (Mladic is my actual GYBE hymn) - music in it's pure form without barriers or style limitations.<br />Mandatory record for GYBE fans - and would also recommend to newbies which can explore the versatility of the band for a long time.
3836501899|4.0|it have my aproval... good book, i did engoy it lot of creative pictures some very simple but is a good book 4 ur library
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I recommend this book to both genders. I originally bought the book for my E reader, but decided to buy hardback copies for my engaged daughter and for my sister. This book reinforced my philosophy and brought many more common sense tips to light. These are ideas that anyone can use in daily decision making. Product arrived sooner than expected shipped from Amazon.
3836501910|1.0|i was expecting more of his works of his celebrities pictures on this book and no its not, this is like his porn era or something like, i know he is known for his snapshot style handycam portraits but this book is dog shit... sorry.... i love TR but this is not what he is doing at this point and its not a biography eather
B00004RFCM|5.0|I needed this season to help complete my DVD set. I needed is as a replacement. The product arrived on time and in good condition. The DVD played in my device and overall happy with the purchase. It met my need for affordable price and shipped fast.
B001U7WUW8|4.0|This description: (LP+CD set) 180 gram vinyl in single pocket Stoughton Jacket with postcard, sticker & bonus CD in paper sleeve.<br /><br />NOT ACCURATE.  Expect just one 180 gram pressing.  Sounding great and vintage.  If you haven't listened to this album, go back to no mans land.
B002RI9MWA|4.0|I highly recommend The Reluctant Fundamentalist particularly BEFORE seeing the movie that has just been released.  It is an insightful and compelling almost &#34;exquisite&#34; read for what has been described as a psychological thriller; a mesmerising monologue by a young Pakistani named Changez and an unnamed American who are sitting at a table in a simple tearoom in Lahore Pakistan. It took a few pages before I realised I had been completely absorbed and this was sustained through to the last page.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I found this helpful, to see how another person's mind might be operating. The leading male was a little too wonderful to believe though.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|This pro version is very weak, even as a free app of the day. It is very basic with such insignificant details that it might as well be a basic free version. In fact, by setting the Kindle to show battery life as a percentage, your Kindle is already doing half of what the app does.<br />Do yourself a favor and grab the free Battery HD app and ignore this junk app.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Unbelievably good! Sanderson has created a world rich with heroes and legends. I can't wait for the next book to come out!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I really loved this movie, I will go ahead and buy it eventually. The best to watch and cry *****ALONE*****
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Beth and Joe.... what a combo!  Cannot say enough good things about this CD, but then you can hardly ever go wrong with this couple, single or together.
B004RE29WW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. it does try to be dark and overpowering, but what else would you expect from a Sci-fi/ Horror movie. Good acting is also a plus.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Rating this book without giving any spoliers so others don't waste their time!!!  Book was boring, was just a filler in the series.  A major thing happens in the book and comes out of the blue and only lasts a half a page!!!  Then the book ends mid story!!!!! I love the idea of more books when they give us a great story and ride!!! Not just taking up space!!
B008ROF8J4|4.0|My husband is a Schwarzenegger fan and enjoyed this movie. Entertaining without too much drama.  Good classic action packed movie.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|It was a while since I  read the book but the title brought back the memories which is rare for me, signifying it was a good read.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|My husband and I are huge stargate fans. Actors in this series were excellent, even as they changed over the years. Will continue to watch reruns on Amazon!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My boys and husband love this game!! They would play it for hours if I would let them.  It is a clean game with no violence which I really like!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is great! Some of the only things I don't like is that it doesn't tell you what some of the stuff is and it wouldn't let me pick up different thing, I couldn't figure out you had to cook iron, how to eat, and how to kill monsters but I got together with one of my friends and she showed me how.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This mini-series was done to absolute perfection! I can't tell you how many times I've watched it from start to finish.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|I have the book in hard cover which is a bit dog eared.<br />I'm trying to get my favorite books in KINDLE format.<br />Thanks, Mr. MASON.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I don't really play mobile games, but since installing the Amazon App Store, I've been enticed by a few. This is, by a country mile, the best game I've played on my mobile. Nothing else manages to hold my interest for long. Kudos to the developers for producing a fun, good looking game with enough quirky charm and thought-provoking puzzliness (?!) to keep me playing.<br /><br />Play it now!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Good mystery and hidden objects making find hidden pieces and clues to track down the murderer.  I was addicted to this game and couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to try the next one.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|The ending left a lot to be desired and if the purpose was to wait for the next book in the series to continue the story then it didnt work.  I have always been a huge fan of jeffrey archer but not after this book.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Didn't remember seeing this before and wanted to rent it before the sequel comes out next month.  After getting into it remembered that I did see it before.  It is kind of a fun movie but there is not much substance.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|First and foremost I feel like I should mention that a trilogy means 3 ....not 4 or 5 but 3.  I feel that Ms. Day decided to capitalize on her series and take advantage of her fans by releasing a book that was ½ finished and sell it as the finished product only to eventually finish the book to sell another one.  I thought parts of the book drug on and other parts completely predictable.  I would like to see how Gideon and Eva's story ends but I will NOT purchase another book written by this lady.  I'll wait to check it out from the library or wait until it finally lands on the free Kindle downloads.
0962477060|5.0|This really is logically laid out. It's a book that when you start reading it, you know you have found something special. You have to be creative to have fun with it, but really with YouTube backing tracks and this book---you can save a bunch of time, and easily see why the guitar is tuned the way it is. It's almost Zen-like in its approach. I have purchased hundreds of guitar books, and this is just a great 3 volume series that seems like it will always have something to offer to me. If you prefer your ear over notation, and enjoy finding patterns and seeing that they seamlessly repeat all over the neck--you owe it to yourself to try it. Makes far more sense than many books that encourage rote memory/modes/etc. Well worth the cost. If you are just starting out, get the version with the DVD--but again, play the lessons over basic backing tracks on YouTube.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It's hard to imagine that 16 and 17 year lovers can have such deep and meaningful conversations and thoughts, but they do. The author forces you to think about your own frailty in this vast universe of tangible and intangible truths.
B00C061I3K|5.0|The gods of music have spoken. Great album from start to finish with a little something for every music taste.
0812993845|1.0|I was really disappointed in this book. I LOVE the Shopaholic series. I think that her writing has hit a decline, it seems like her books are getting worse. I also didn't care for I've got your number.  I don't think I will read another Kinsella book for a while. I agree with another reviewer as I also cringed at a few points. I'm not sure I laughed or chuckled once. I have never been so ready to finish a book in my life. Horrible book, ridiculous story line and the characters were annoying.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I started watching the television show and wanted to try and figure out parts that were confusing. The book is very well written. It holds your interest throughout. This is not the type of book I usually read. I am not big on magic and the supernatural. However that was not a major focus and I found this book to be an enjoyable read.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|It would have been easier IF this were all in one DVD, instead of divided into two DVD's.  But Great to watch.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|The acting was great.  The story line was very Hitchcockesque.  I found all the characters believable. I would recommend it as a rental.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such a good book!!!  Kept me entertained the whole way through. Never know what was coming next. Surprising end. Love!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Beautifully written novel that moves gracefully through the decades following it's main characters through Afghanistan, Greece and the US. Told through different character's point of view, I love the intricate weaving of the storyline. A story so true to life, as we witness  one decision that makes such an enormous impact on the lives of many, changing their course of history forever. It's a story of family bonds, tough decisions we have to make, and the profound sense of longing one feels for their roots. I loved this novel. A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS was my absolute favorite, THE KITE RUNNER was amazing but I related more the SPLENDID SUNS as I am a female. Definitely try his lastest novel, AND THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED, I would give it 4.5 stars if I could give another .5 star!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app! Has a game for every mood, and the unlockable extra games just make me want to play longer!
B00005JLR2|5.0|My young nephews here in Mexico loved this movie especially since it is in Spanish too (NOW DON'T GET EXCITED BIGOTS).
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|The foul language throughout this film was an assault on my ears. I haven't listened to it yet, but I'm hoping that the French track will be less offensive.  Even if the real people involved did really talk like that, including this profanity in the film only detracted from the power of the story.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I can honestly say that I love this series. I love the progression and the way that we are gently floated from one situation to another. It is done with finesse and precision but the downside is, that natural beauty that this story possess seems to have you wanting more and the time between the more is brutal and starting to wear on me.<br /><br />I am thoroughly confused as to if I want more or if I would just like for Eva and Gideon to get a break and just have their HEA already!<br /><br />I was terribly disappointed with the results of the Nathan situation from Reflected in you, as I believe that is a huge cloud that will forever hang over them and will change everything from here on out.<br /><br />Jealousy, possession, love and all the emotions in the world can sometimes be unable to over power guilt and uncertainty. And those will forever be with this couple as this story takes some very dangerous twists and turns. I believe too many enemies are being made and Eva and Gideon are reckless in their undying, over powering love that they will slip and fall if they aren't careful.<br /><br />The series once again carried a lovely set of characters and I love them all for the part that they all play so well. You are seeing changes in a way you are hardly ever afforded in a book and I appreciate that. Still, even with the changes and progresses being made, the original characters keep their tenacity and appeal that brought us to them in the first place.<br /><br />Eva was still the right mix of everything and I love her fierceness and loyalty that she exude throughout the series. She has always found a way to be this confident and assertive character while still being insecure at all times. It's a delicate balance that she handles well and I love seeing her character go through the days and motions.<br /><br />Gideon was back and better than ever! Gideon in love is the best of all the sides portrayed so far, and even though it is frighteningly intense, I love it anyways and hope to one day find a love like that. Frightening but sure.<br /><br />Carey was also still around messing up as usual and Gideon's ex's seem to be festering like sores. All in all, it was a good one with even more issues and emotions to process. Even infidelity is being highlighted.<br /><br />There were a few heart warming and emotional ringers in this one and the *spoiler alert* prenuptial scene *spoiler alert* was definitely one. I loved the terms and how it was unexpected and beautifully done. I couldn't have asked for a better scene to embark on that journey.<br /><br />Still, there were too (emphasis on the too) many unfinished situations which left me with too much answers and no time frame as to when they will be answered. I can't even count on one hand all the things that are happening and not one was any closer to being solved at the end of this novel. Even a hint of something would have been good. At least say winter 2013 or something!!<br /><br />First we waited four months in between book 1 and 2 then that was doubled with an 8 months wait for book 3 am I to find a pattern here and say 16 months will be the release time for book 4? I surely hope not. While I would like to see this beautiful story come to a close, before it is drawn out to ridiculousness, it seems the author has other plans  in mind and plan for a book 4 and 5. While I think it's thoughtless and wrong to ruin a beautiful story by milking it and trying to make a cash cow from it, if you decide to do it, then shorten the wait before fans loose interest and faith in the HEA we are all so desperately searching for.<br /><br />Another beautifully written novel in the crossfire series and  I can only hope the next two will be as filling and maybe we can stop there before this series turns into a soap opera and make us all lose interest!ways and hope to one day find a love like that.

B003CRM6QO|5.0|If you disagree, you are WRONG! This is the most fantastic, epic, STUPENDOUS movie of ALL time! Sam Jones KILLS the role as Flash Gordon in a movie where he never even spoke a word! Yes, that's right, Sam Jones has a person speak his lines throughout the whole movie but his acting is out of this world! (literally)<br /><br />A movie with James Bond (Timothy Dalton), Robin Hood's father (Brian Blessed) and that dude from Minority Report (MING!), who can really go wrong? If you don't buy this movie, you are a traitor to Hollywood and you should have your head thrown into the tree stump where that weird creature lives in the movie! (OMG, SPOILERS!)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is excellent. The only thing that bothers me, is that ios users have the new 7.0 update and we don't. Sure the new update is buggy but we'll finally have cake, realms, and so much more. Please update!
1781162646|4.0|I love Stephen King's work very much, but for some reason I didn't think I was going to really enjoy this one. Thankfully, I was wrong. This is a very good book! I read it in just a few hours because I couldn't put it down. A bit different from a lot of his books, but it is worth a read!
B001CVMD4M|5.0|This dvd was one of their concerts filmed at Wembley stadium.[[ASIN:B001CVMD4M Live at Wembley]] They sang mama, viva forever and other spicey favorite songs. I hope they reunite again.I loved the spic3 girls and they're independent girl power attitudes.so they could tell me what they want what they really really want anytime. I especially loved sporty spice. Shes so pretty and sporty.I hope she got help for her anorexia or bulimia.I hope they reunite again soon.if 98● and new kids could reunite than fans should beg them to come back.cuz spice girls,I love you♥
B00CFQMVLS|5.0|Willis pulled it off again. (all about blow them up) Got to be 1 of top 2 of this franchise.I guest between the very first cause it was a fresh story and willis was in it.and this, for its great action scene's and willis was in it. it took a while to make another but, it was worth it.

B002VPE1X4|5.0|I like how my either of my P&S cameras fit in it; it has a nice storage pouch in front of the camera compartment, and I hope that Amazon continues offering this case, which was a great value for very little money at the time I purchased it.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|Updated 2.0.3.102460154 with this app and it made my Galaxy 7 tablet problems with the Kindle app worse.  I uninstalled it. There seems to be no solution for the bugs in this app at this time.  Also am now having issues with the orientation lock on my tablet that I have been unable to fix.  I suspect my Kindle issues are causing this.  Am very unhappy with Kindle and wish I had not installed this app on my tablet to begin with.
1611136954|5.0|Nice twists in this one and Mickey Haller character never disappoints. I highly reccomend for Connelly fans. Looking for more Haller books.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|Well written and very informative . John Palmer is well known in the home brewing community, and shares his vast knowledge of the subject through this book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entwined With You was a great read just like the other 2 in the series, not only have I been taking many cold showers lol, but you learn more about the characters and cant wait to get to the next page to see what will happen. I loved it cannot wait for book #4!!!!!!!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|It's surprising how Michael Connelly takes you in so many directions and then has all the ends tied up for you in a neat bow when he's done.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, as I have each and every book he has written.  Well worth buying and reading again years later.  Well done
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I visited several sites prior to my beloved Amazon. I wanted to know what other readers had to say about your third FINAL BOOK. Then I slept on it to formulate my own opinion. Amazon readers confirmed what I read from the other reviews. When an author says a book is a trilogy, make it so. Readers don't like new characters introduced in what is to be the final book. Thirdly, to your readers it all comes down to what you care about. Your writing which is about us (your readers) doing what you say (us) and when you don't you send us a message loud and clear that the next two installments will cost us money to line your pocket with (sending us the final message) that is your bottom line.<br />Amazon can attest I am an avid kindle reader. You have impressed me with your writing skills and I have enjoyed your other books. All the writing courses I have taken, taught me it is not wise to introduce new characters in your last book. I am disappointed, disengaged, and you have disheartened me. I pray when and if I begin my writing career I stick to my word. As a future author, it is all we have.<br />I won't be buying Entwined with You I would become Indebted to You (Sylvia) for the fourth and fifth installments that will follow.<br />There are so many wonderful authors selling short stories and novellas that need our support. Their writing styles are just as good as Sylvia Day if not better given the opportunity.<br />Readers that have purchased your ebook on several sites have returned it at alarming rates, as I smile typing this. Here I didn't know that was possible. Things one learns.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|What the crap was that.. I was so excited about this book and I feel let down in a major way... I don't feel like anything was accomplished. This book was just a bunch of BS... UGH!!!!!!!!  Horrible and I can't believe you are stretching it out to five books... These next two better be F'ing awesome or you can count me out of ever buying your books again!!!!!!!!!!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I got this for my son's birthday. He has seen it before and liked it enough to want to own the movie. I haven't seen it so can't really comment on it, but I must admit when I was younger both my brother and I were really into this type movie, so I'm sure I'd like it, too.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great book right from the start!  Can't wait to read The Hit.  This one will get you hooked and keep you there all the way through.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|As with the rating of Season One, the same goes for this one. I bought both Seasons, one and two. I give this one the same top rating as Season One. And yes, he is recommending the movies to all his friends.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|I was impressed with the story and the action scenes were great. The way they played with the main character was very intriguing as well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It not a bad app I just think it was to easy ... I got through the whole game in about an hour!!!!!
0307949486|3.0|Maybe I approached this book with expectations...I don't know. it was ok but I don't feel compelled to read the rest of the series.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is the best app ever! mystery man highly reccommends getting this app for Ze brony funzezez ez 19 20! words!
B00AVL23YE|5.0|Simply putL: I Love it!  I haven't quite figured out how to get it to automatically &#34;push&#34; emails to me so I have to refresh everytime I update. Other than that - it's great.  It took me a day to get used to the layout and navigate through the options, but overall - considering the cost (hello, free!) it's great.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|i love this game. very challenging and fun. meet new friends and play with family. fun fun fun. great way to spend a rainy day.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|If you are an Anthony Hopkins fan, and I am, this is worth seeing. Also an interesting story about the changing of the movie codes during that time period.  They worried about things that today would be on prime time TV without a blink.  I think the world was much better back then when people were concerned about not defining deviancy down.
B00C70FG2S|5.0|I have loved DT since their inception.  Although, initially I was put off by the use of clean vocals on the Projector album I must say that the use here is completely justified, effortless and stunning.  Also, I enjoy the work on the Projector album more now than I did when it was initially released, in part, because I have gotten older and appreciate the use of different vocals within a song to convey the emotion involved.  Now, emotion is all over this album and it very much speaks to me on so many levels.  Every song is an absolute masterpiece.  Standout tracks to me are, For Broken Words, What Only You Know, State of Trust and Weight of the World.  If you are a fan of DT, melodic death metal or just great metal than you need this in your collection.  I can't stop listening to it and you won't either.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|The Sheriff's character had the makings to have been a lot more interesting, but the plot, characters and dialogue killed what little of that there could have been.  Some of it was, quite frankly, pretty stupid.  Not sure why the bad guys spent so much time and effort to build a bridge across the gorge, rather than steal, rent or buy a helicopter to get the drug kingpin into Mexico.  BTW, Johnny Knoxville played an idiot.  Go figure. The Forrest Whitaker character was so over the top that he was not believable. But if you like Arnold, and I do, it was worth the price.
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|I like this score but it's not a lot of music, even for a soundtrack.<br />Musically, it works from the same themes as the 2009 ST but adds some new, interesting, and different material to accompany the London and Kronos storylines.  Overall, not as good a soundtrack as the movie is a movie.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I liked this movie.  It's based on mistaken identity (&#34;Who are you?&#34;) which always makes for an interesting story.  Well written and keeps your interest.  I saw it twice to pick up the details missed on the first viewing.  Timothy Olyphant played Raylan Givens by another name, but I like Timothy Olyphant and Justified is between seasons, so that was OK with me.  I must be getting older when they cast Timothy Olyphant  as a father figure to a young man.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After waiting for close to a year for Entwined to come out, I read this book in one sitting, could not put it down, did not want to put it down!  I will say Gideon and Eva did not disappoint! Their chemistry is so Hot.... I also liked that the story touched on some of the other characters in the book, I want to know more about Corrine, what makes Gideon the way that he is, more about Eva's father and mother, more about Brett Kline.  I will anxiously wait for the 4th book in the installment to come out~ I just hope it does not take a year for a little more of Ace and Angel!!!

B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I'll just start off and say that this is my 2nd favorite queens album (behind songs for the deaf). The music in this album is a lot more melodic and dark than any of there other albums. There are still plent of good, heavy riffs such as in My God is the Sun and I Sat by the Ocean. This album is essential for any queens fan as well as anyone who appreciates good music!

B00BPWDMP2|4.0|Another hit album by this ultra talented group has surfaced! Top notch writing, an excellent band, the production has reached first class. The only reason for four stars is (in my humble opinion) it does not come up to &#34;Own The Night&#34; in song writing. They have stated that they needed to do something a bit different and they did accomplish that. The new album has material that will do amazingly well in a live performance. &#34;Own The Night&#34; has songs that really grab me emotionally.<br /><br />All that said, the new CD is wonderful on all accounts. It's delightful audio-wise and the band plays beautifully. The three are in fine form!<br /><br />Get it!

B00BEXB18M|2.0|I've been a Megadeth fan for almost a decade now, and they're pretty much my favorite band.  Each of their albums have been very good, with a few alright albums here or there, such as Risk or World Needs A Hero.  However, I like the band so much I can even see past the flaws of those albums.  Megadeth, as a band, simply rules.<br /><br />Their recent albums have sounded awesome; System Has Failed sounded like the band back in their prime, United Abominations was politically-charged, but still sounded excellent.  Endgame was a head-rattler from beginning to end, and even Thirteen had a lot of great songs.  However, I could tell with a few songs on that album (such as Fast Lane and Wrecker) that Dave Mustaine may have began losing his touch for writing solid-sounding metal anthems, instead relying on chunky riffs and corny lyrics.<br /><br />So of course, I was let-down by a majority of what Super Collider has to offer.  Kingmaker starts things off alright, but the momentum begins dwindling through the title track, and shot itself in the foot as soon as I heard Mustaine sing \\"Burn, Baby Burn\\" in the track that followed.  Most (actually, all) of the album's tracks go under five minutes a piece, which sends a signal to me that Dave was shooting for as radio-friendly of an album as possible, and not \\"dark and gritty\\" like he had been teasing in the months leading up to the album's release.<br /><br />That's not to say all the tracks are bad, though.  In fact I find two songs from the album to be particularly strong; \\"Built For War\\" has something good going there, and \\"The Blackest crow\\" sounds so markedly different from Megadeth's entire catalog that it's worth giving a listen by itself.<br /><br />Aside from those two tracks, nearly everything else can be easily avoided and you wouldn't be missing out on much.  The only way I can give the album a solid recommendation is if you're a long-time Megadeth fan and must have their most recent release.  Casual fans and/or those looking for a great entry album for hearing Dave Mustaine should just start with Peace Sells But Who's Buying or Rust in Peace.  Then give the rest of their catalog a listen, and when you're ready give this a try.<br /><br />Then it just might be enjoyable enough.  For now though, this is definitely the St. Anger of Megadeth's catalog if I dare say it. *hides in a corner*looking for a great entry album for hearing Dave Mustaine should just start with Peace Sells But Who's Buying or Rust in Peace.

B002NNA9N0|4.0|I first saw this back in the late 1990's at the suggestion of one of my managers. I was in sales at the time. This movie perfectly captures the salesman's day...the agony of the cold call, and the thrill of making the sale. The movie moves at a slow pace and for the most part takes place in two rooms, but is worth it none the less. Baldwin's piece early in the movie is priceless...it's where Dennis Miller got part of his bumper spiel on his radio show.
0316017930|5.0|This is my first Malcolm Gladwell book.  Thank you friend for recommending this book.  \\"Outliers\\" is a very interesting and proved to be thought provoking.  The book is a result of his research on exceptionally successful people like Bill Gates, The Beatles, Joe Flom and others.<br /><br />I was always curious about how these people become so successful at their chosen careers and Mr. Malcolm will give you the explanations that comes with their successes.  The book is not a \\"how to become an outlier\\" but it explains how some has achieved such success.<br /><br />It explains how successful hockey players are  mostly born from January to March.  That kids born earlier in the year are physically more developed and thus get noticed and given more opportunity to play and better coaching.  Bill Gates and other software tycoons were born at the right time.  They were in college when computers are just starting out.  They seized the opportunity for computer time when the computer world was just young.  Michael Jordan might be very tall but it is not just his height that made him such a successful player.  Joe Flom a good Jewish lawyer, who was practicing business takeover law when nobody else was taking those cases.<br /><br />Intellect may be important but as the psychologist Lewis Terman followed high IQ children into adulthood, it shows that intellect and achievement are FAR from perfectly correlated.  That one can have general and practical intelligence but it does not imply the presence of the other in all instances.  High I.Q. kids with involved parents also contributed to their success in adulthood.<br /><br />The outliers possesses the combinations of being born at the right time and place, were given the extraordinary opportunity to put in the 10,000 hour rule to practice their crafts, has vision, talent and were in the right time and place.  They were not just innately programmed to be a success, they put in hard work, lived in a community where their potentials were encourage and \\"luck\\" was there at the right moment.<br /><br />In our everyday life scenario, does it mean we should prevent our kids from being the youngest in everything they do?  Should we demand hours and hours of practice in the things they decide to play,  be it in academics, sports, music and others?<br /><br />I have a friend whose kids all have close to 4.0 GPA, all excel at the extracurricular activities they joined.  Is it just because they are genetically intelligent and talented?  Or is it because of the cultural legacy of being a second generation Asian-American?  But then, not all second generation Americans are Bill Gates in the making.  Are all their waking moment spent in studying and practicing?  I don't drive my kids around to lots of stuff like my friend did all these years, does it mean I am giving my kids less opportunity to excel?
B00CATSONE|3.0|I think a more appropriate title would be something along the lines of &#34;Goal Setting/Perseverance and The Amazing Tesla,&#34; since much of the book talks about not Tesla, but belief in oneself and following your dreams. So much so that I wondered if I had downloaded the wrong book at first. It's fairly well written, but think long essay instead of book.<br /><br />I will say that this work did get me even more interested in Tesla...but for that I will need more books. Suggestions anyone?

B009NY43NY|5.0|I for one  got the ending I always wanted to this series. Yes there were other options that were VERY attractive and exciting and completely unrealistic given who Sookie was. She needed a life out of the dark and a chance for the deep abiding continuity of love and family. For me, there was only one choice to give her that. I have tried not to give any spoilers here and keep it vague .But this entire series is a good read and while I am sad it is ending, I am happy for Sookie and the wonderful prospects for the future that Charlaine gave her.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Yes, I've read  Suns and Kite Runner and enjoyed them both but Mountains took my breath away. Beautiful characterization and soulful. The point of view often challenged me and I'd have to back track to determine whose voice was speaking. That effort forced me to slow down and so I actually was able to better appreciate the often subtle shifts. I wept several times as I was reading and the story was painful and extraordinary-as is life.
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|Not the greatest literary achievement in the world, but the Sookie Stackhouse series were mostly enjoyable. However, this was a disappointing end to the series. The ending felt dull.
B0095P31L6|5.0|The parody of many old TV westerns made our family laugh and laugh hard.  We loved it and will watch it again.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|After loving the first 2 in this series I was disappointed at how boring I found the first half of the book. Then I was just starting to get into it big time and bam...it ended! Too many unanswered questions, not a cliffhanger but just blah! I really hope it's not to long until the next book comes out. I feel Gideon and Eva have been done an injustice by this filler in the series!
B0047SIXGE|2.0|This is the first time I have watched redux version. I enjoyed the original scenes and the new footage, but I was ready for the movie to be over before it finished. The reason was the about 50 mins. into the film, the screen froze and I was unable to do anything about it. I elected to turn it off and try again the next day. I did this, fast-forwarding to about where it froze before, and watched another half hour or so until it froze again. Again, I was unable to control the image on my TV, so I just turned it off .  Several hours later, I returned to the movie, fast-forwarded to the previous freeze-point and finally saw the conclusion of the movie. I have always appreciated Martin Sheen as an extraordinary actor and this was no different. Unfortunately, even with Sheen as the lead, I was ready to be done with this movie before it ended because of the freeze delays previously. The 2-stars was only because of the screen freezing, otherwise, it would have been 5 star rating.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I truly loved this story - it was by far my favorite and I anxiously waited for what I thought was going to be the end to an amazing journey with Hideon and Eva. I'm so disappointed that Mrs. Day has decided that money was more important that good story telling to loyal readers. I just paid $9.99 and have no idea what I paid for. This wasn't a book - it was a seris of unnecessary incidents thrown together with the intent of leading the readers on to continue to pay a ridiculous amount of money to obtain a conclusion. Sorry, so disappointed with this author that I'll never purchase from her again.

B00CXN2JNS|3.0|Has some catchy generic rock songs with hooks, there is a good amount of guitar solos, but it seems to be lacking the typical 'thinking man's metal' tag that megadeth gets. A lot of the lyrics aren't thought provoking (I've heard some complaints that it sounds like Dave threw some works in a random rhyme generator and just used those for lyrics. A lot of cliche rhymes. The riffs are better than 13, but far behind UA or Endgame.

B00BF11STU|2.0|I was anxious to see this movie after reading, No Easy Day.  The movie ended up being a disappointment.  It showed bits and pieces of various things that happened over an eleven year span.  It never really went into detail about anything.  The last twenty minutes (what everyone was waiting for) was completely lack luster and didn't exactly follow what happened in the book.<br /><br />The movie also had a political agenda.  We got to see CIA agents not only torturing people, but enjoying it.  Along with, the Navy Seals killing a woman and repeatedly shooting people who were already dead.<br /><br />Just a few ideas for better plots.  The life of Bin Laden, from being trained by the USA, to the CIA not taking the opportunity to kill him in the 90's to his death in Pakistan.  Or the mission that killed him, beginning with the Seals training in North Carolina, following the details of the book.  Last, if you want to see what the CIA does, then simply make a documentary.<br /><br />It amazes me a movie producer can take a real life, extremely interesting story and turn it into crap.  I mean, the story is there.  Get some props and actors, half the work has been done for you.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Pretty good but you could add better characters and make the characters less expensive. It would be rocking awesome if we could make our own character for about 1,000 coins. I like it but there is no need for coin purchases and you can make it actually possible to get a jackpot so we don't buy a million mystery boxes from jackpot dreams.
B003NX76BM|5.0|The pace and focus of this novel are very different from those I've come to expect from the In Death series Roberts writes as J D Robb.  The pace is almost leisurely, allowing Roberts to focus far more on character development and character revelation through dialogue, for example.  I'd forgotten how good Nora Roberts is with dialogue.  I rediscovered her talent in The Search.  I kept finding myself grinning at the charm, quick wit, and sheer delightfulness of her wonderful characters as they just chatted with each other.  I also learned a great deal more about dog training than I did about the crime and mystery at the center of this novel!  I can understand why some reviewers were disappointed, for example, by the quick resolution of the action, but I found, as I settled into the novel, that the pace was being set by the focus on relationships and not crimes, and so didn't even note the anti-climatic nature of the ending until I read the reviews!  All in all, I really enjoyed The Search and recommend it to other readers of the In Death books if they will read it without extraneous expectations, and if they will allow Roberts to be Roberts and Robb to be Robb!

0143038583|4.0|Michael Pollin's \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" is an insightful look into the modern diet, agriculture, and nutritional ethics.  The dilemma is an internal anxiety in humans between a fear of eating anything new and a risky but necessary openness to new tastes.  Pollin does a very good job at exploring the basis of modern agribusiness (corn) and the deceptive marketing of large scale organic argiculuture.<br /><br />However, Pollin's quasi-Marxist explanation of market forces is misleading.  He sees capitalism as a destructive force changing all cultural and economic factors in its path.  The accumulation of capital and monoculture is a necessary requirement to remain competitive.  This creates a race to produce the most production on perpetually diminishing marginal profit.  Issues of equity are exacerbated as most farms go hopelessly into debt while only the largest, most capital intensive farms, survive.  Administrative agencies serve the vested interests of the wealthiest farmers and middlemen (ex: Monsanto).  This has created an unsustainable economy that will eventually collapse upon itself unless action is taken.<br /><br />This narrative lacks depth.  The farming subsidies do distort markets, agribusinesses does create excessive negative externalities, and society does not pay the real cost of the food it eats.  However, even if you were to take away all subsidies and negative externalities, the reality of the market would not significantly change.  It would increase price for food and decrease demand.  People would pay more for food and have less variety (especially the poor).  Small (inefficient) farms would go out of business due to lack of subsidies and decreasing prices for commodities.<br /><br />The system would not change.  If corn became too expensive, many substitutes exist to take its place (ex: Cane Sugar).  Pollin even admits that Polyface Farms is 2-3x more expensive than mass produced food.  Even without subsidies, agribusiness would still be significantly cheaper.  Agribusinesses is simply much more efficient than alternative small producers.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  It's creative destruction.  It's what makes capitalism such a vibrant force of wealth.ficantly cheaper.  Agribusinesses is simply much more efficient than alternative small producers.

Love the series. I even liked this installment, but the ending was completely unsatisfying and I won't buy the rest of what was billed as a trilogy. Not a good way to treat loyal fans.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I don't like the homosexual agenda being added to this film. They could have just as well left it out of the movie. 2 men kissing and in bed with one another is still perversion.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|What a fun ride! I seriously couldn't put it down!  I was torn between dying to find out what happened next and not wanting the story to end too quickly!  I found Rose sweetly innocent and  spunky, when she finally found her voice. I can see why Joe fell in love with her, I did too! Can't wait to read more!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Nice game! It was in high quality, it is a time killer, and it was extremely fun and scary! But it did have tons of illuminati Masonic signs in it. Other than that, it was cool.
B002NJWHHA|4.0|It was good...just the fact that audio/speech of the characters didn't come towards the end..so i had to use captions...but overall it was good.

B00571F26Y|3.0|If you tend to be anxious about dietary matters, The Wheat Belly Cookbook will scare the bejeezus out of you.  Today's wheat will give you diabetes, cause obesity, ruin your joints, hair, and skin, shorten your lifespan, and end up giving you dementia, according to Dr. Davis.<br /><br />Supposing you embrace these arguments, The Wheat Belly Cookbook does offer some palatable solutions.  As in most gluten-free books, there's a substantial section devoted to recipes you probably don't make with wheat to begin with - stews, frittatas, chili, vegetable sides.  But it's the wheat-free baking sections, with their abundant healthier alternatives to familiar baked goods, that will prove to be a standby if you choose to drop the wheat.<br /><br />If you find this summary helpful, there's more: you can read my reviews and analysis of the latest new cookbooks on CookShelf, the cookbook-rating app (available for both iPhone/iPad and Android).  -

1452101248|5.0|here's a reason Plenty topped the Best-of cookbook charts in 2011, when it was published.  Its all-vegetable recipes are prepared with the kind of attention chefs often only lavish on their proteins, and the book itself is thoughtful, focused, and handsome.  (The same is true for its successor, Jerusalem.)<br /><br />Each vegetable sallies forth with a few flattering companions: walnut and tahini yogurt for the mushrooms, mustard seeds and tarragon for the green beans.  There's whole grains and pulses, savory roots and glorious eggplants, and while the sourcing can be tricky (dried Persian limes, freekeh, Turkish sheep's cheese) if you don't live near a good Middle Eastern grocery, the dividends are great.<br /><br />If you find this summary helpful, there's more: you can read my reviews and analysis of the latest new cookbooks on CookShelf, the cookbook-rating app (available for both iPhone/iPad and Android).

1433502410|5.0|I love it.  I have learned so much more about the Bible.  I read the text and then read the study information for complete clarification.  My spiritual life has greatly improved , due to being able to understand and grow from the research of this book.  The print is a little small , because there is so much information contained.  I have ordered a magnifying glass to compensate.  I will use this forever and then leave it to someone else to learn.

B00COGY2P2|3.0|Tom Cruise captures the essence of Jack Reacher but, as a reader of Lee Childs' books, I cannot ignore the twelve inches and one hundred pound difference between Cruise and Reacher. Otherwise good movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for the next book! I love this series! Thank you for such a great book and characters that you really get to know and pull for through out the story. Keep writing!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I absolutely love it.  Now that I have my new Android phone (old one wouldn't link)  when I click on my Kindle for Android App - it is EXACTLY where I had left off reading on my Kindle or Ipad.

B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie is classic. the best we seen. My uncile jack was killed on the US Battaleship W.Va at Pearl.
B006P96PAO|2.0|It was okay. It certainly wasn't the greatest story ever told. I thought the message of needing a good father was important, but I noticed that the gang members were all black, and the black police officer hadn't been raised by his own father. It isn't that such things don't happen, but those stereotypes weren't really offset by anything else in the movie, so were sort of glaring. Additionally, the movie plot was about as predictable as it could possibly be, but that isn't the point of the movie. The point is to see some nice people that still love Jesus. Considering they are trying to show cops as heroes, it is a little disingenuous and hypocritical. It is like showing soldiers as heroes. They're just guys that have a job that requires they carry a gun. Every now and then they might act heroic, but in all honesty, I'm tired of them. I'm an upstanding, law-abiding citizen who has never gotten on the wrong side of the law, but cops still don't seem to be very nice people, so watching a movie about them was...hard. By the way, I only watched this because of a school assignment.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book took so long to come out! I'm not looking forward to waiting again! How long is this one going to take! I am happy that this is not the end to their story and I look forward to finding out what will come next, I just hope we get more story and just a little bit less sex. ( I said a LITTLE)

1401324649|3.0|Allan escapes from a nursing home on his 100th birthday. This book follows the relentlessly cheerful centenarian as he converts criminals to good guys and preserves his freedom. Alternating with this is Allan's life up 100 which has tangled him with many of the world leaders and events since the 1930's. The plotting is good and sometimes ingenious, especially when it offers new explanations for known events. The telling is humorous and there are passages you will want to read out loud. Eventually the constant serendipitous scene shifting makes this feel like a soap opera with expected cliff hangers. A good, funny read.
B000EOTTV8|3.0|Was very slow at times. The caractors were a little hard to believe. Although the actors were just very fair.

B008JJM88Q|5.0|Normally I rate apps either because they really are bad or they are good. This app is one of the most intuitive and fun apps that I've seen. If you are one of those people worried about permissions then pass ....but being cautious pretty much ruins it for the majority of apps out there. Guess you could suggest that it is a data mining app but I would venture to say that many of the paranoid crowd already have apps on their devices that already fit the equation.  if your not of the paranoid mentality and want a 5 star entertainment app then check this one out.<br /><br />IF YOUR WORRIED ABOUT DATA MINING THEN STOP USING ANY PHONE,  TABLET, ETC BECAUCE IF YOU LIVE IN THE United States of data theft IT'S PRETTY MUCH A FACT THAT YOUR ILLUSTRIOUS PRESIDENT IS SPYING ON YOU.

B0089LOG02|4.0|This was an interesting novel based on practices that actually happened.  Treatment of the Irish and orphans in general leave one to ponder at what life was like during this time.
B003U4UOOK|5.0|Be warned...It was cancelled after the first season but I felt it ended okay.  Solid acting and story line.  I thought I could read the book, but found out the series was 'loosely' based upon it.  If you're a hardcore SciFi person and itching for something to watch (because we're in a TV SciFi drought at the time of this writing) Flash Forward is worth watching.

1423140605|5.0|Summary: I have to say Percy is my favorite narrator of any of Rick Riordan's books. So I was pleased to see he was one of the narrators in The Mark of Athena by Rick Riordan. This is the first book in The Heroes of Olympus series that features Annabeth as one of the narrators. Annabeth is pleased to be reunited with Percy. However, their reunion is overshadowed by The Mark of Athena that her mother gave her (in her Roman form Minerva.) As soon as the heroes from the Greek camp arrive, tensions arise between the camps. The Romans are thrilled to see their old praetor Jason; however Jason has been replaced by Percy.  The meeting between the two camps does not end well. Some Greek demi-gods and some Roman demi-gods end up fleeing on the Argo II. After this meeting, the heroes journey across America and across the sea to rescue someone and to close the Doors of Death. The character development is one of the best aspects of this book. We get to see that the demi-gods are more than the stereotypes about their parents. Gaea remains a menacing presence throughout this book. This book contains constant action, interesting backstory, and sweet romances between the couples that we have grown to love. I cannot wait for the next installment of this series.<br />My Thoughts:  This is my favorite installment of this series. There are many surprises and funny moments in this book. I was so happy to see Annabeth and Percy reunited.  One character who undergoes a transformation in this novel is Piper. Piper is a compelling character who demonstrates that she is more than her roots. I really like that Riordan provides glimpses of other myths in his various series. I also enjoy reading about more obscure gods and goddesses and monsters.  The dialogue in this book is sweet, sad, and powerful! There are various settings throughout this book, from the plains of Kansas to the blue waters of the Mediterranean.  It would be nice to see friendships develop between the various heroes, but I feel that is implied. There is constant action in this book. However, sometimes the action can be distracting when you would like to read more history of the gods or demi-gods. There is a major cliffhanger that may leave you screaming at the book. I hope the author will use one of the two characters to be a narrator of the next book. I would recommend The Mark of Athena to readers who enjoy Greek mythology or fantasy.eel that is implied.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Overall this game is good. I really enjoy playing it. I'd really like to be able to change the outfits and to also go back to previous levels. Those are the only things I'd like to see change with the game. Other than that it is very enjoyable! =)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My kindle has been kidnapped by my kids and husband and it's all due to this game! They absolutely LOVE this app! It's challenging, but still easy enough for my 4 year old to play.

B0087EVHVW|5.0|This unit installed with OEM Windows 7 w/o any trouble at all from Microsoft. I did have to reinstall the nVidia drivers in order<br />to get out of Windows Classic mode. Several days later I needed to reinstall the Asus sound card drivers as well. It replaced an<br />i3 2120.<br />  I installed CPUID HW Monitor to keep tabs on the temps. Temps while gaming were going up to 73 C. I see no sense in<br />cheaping out on this machine I built so I ordered an Arctic Cooling Freezer 13. Temps while gaming haven't gone over 53 C.<br />after installing the Freezer 13. I keep the HW Monitor minimized, so the max temps are always noted in it's UI.<br />  The Turbo Boost function works automatically. I installed a desktop gadget from Intel to check on that. I have since uninstalled<br />it. It was slowing down the system start-up way too much.<br />  For what it's worth, I tried installing Core Temp and my Comodo Security suite would not allow it. Core Temp was trying to<br />install &#34;cookieman.exe&#34; and whatnot. It just went on and on until I aborted the installation. I didn't get one popup from Comodo<br />while installing the 2.44 MB CPUID HW Monitor.<br />  No techie am I, so that's it. Don't forget to check that the heatsink is properly seated on the mobo!

0920668372|5.0|I loved this book as a child, and because one of my friends was expecting, I hoped that her child would love this book as much as I had. I haven't read it for many years, but once I received it, I read it and renewed my love of it again. It was in great condition, as promised, and the pictures and words were beautifully printed. When I gave it to my friend, she cried a little. Her child probably won't be able to read the book for a few more years, but hopefully, the book will stay in their possession for many years to come.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this novel immensely. The main character is dead. The author meanders back and forth through time and from the conflicting viewpoints of the two main characters to solve the who, when, where, and why. A very good read for mystery lovers.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great game but i found out that they released a new update (0.7.1) and it wont let me get it. help?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Just like the 1st two books, I could not put it down.  There is so much going on with so many of the characters. It keeps your mind spinning. Hot hot hot scenes with my favorite couple.  I really hope they get their happily ever after soon.
1781162646|4.0|Being a longtime Stephen King fan, when Titan Books offered to send me a review copy of Joyland, I jumped at the chance. Honestly not knowing what to expect from a Hard Case Crime novel written by Stephen King, I delved into the book as soon as I could.<br /><br />Joyland is the story about a man, Dev, in his early 20's who takes a summer job at an amusement park called... well... Joyland in the 1970's. During his summer employment, Dev discovers that an unsolved murder still hangs over the park in the form of a ghost that many people have claimed to have seen in the House of Horrors. But mostly, Joyland is really about the friendships Dev forms during that summer, as well as the personal growth process he experiences there.<br /><br />And therein lies the story. Joyland is not about a murder mystery at all - the unsolved crime in the book is just part of the setting. The story is about Dev and is focused almost entirely on him (and told in first person from his point of view). This is not the Stephen King we're used to. This is the Stephen King who gave us a story like The Body (later to become the film Stand By Me) - and at times, Joyland reminded me of that much earlier work.<br /><br />This is also not a scary book. There is a ghost, but this is not a typical Stephen King \\"OMG, we are so screwed and the evil clown is going to eat us\\" story. I found this refreshing as I have felt lately that King was beginning to repeat a lot of his own tropes (don't get me wrong, I still find those tropes entertaining). Do not expect any references to other books or The Dark Tower. Joyland is a standalone novel.<br /><br />But don't get me wrong, because this is still a Stephen King book. And Joyland excels with things that King has always been great at: developing characters through dialogue. The man is a genius when it comes to giving characters their own voices in his novels and Joyland is no different. But King takes it a step further and introduces us to carny talk - that sort of special language that people who work in the carnival and amusement business have that is uniquely their own. Due to this, something as simple as an amusement park feels like its very own exotic location.<br /><br />The characters themselves are beautifully realized. I found myself crying at the end of the book (no spoilers here) because of the way that King developed their relationships. This book is special - something everyone should read.<br /><br />If I had one complaint, though, about Joyland, it is this: Stephen King insisted that there be no digital copy made of the book. You can't get this on the Kindle, Nook or on a tablet. As someone who has trouble reading at times due to bad vision, I'm knocking off a point of my otherwise brilliant review for that. I understand that King wanted to create a whole pulp fiction experience with this novel. However, to me, the only important thing about a book is what's on its pages - its words and its story. You can wrap it up however you'd like, but if the story is good, a reader will remember that long after they've forgotten what the cover design looked like. I will admit that my reading glasses gave me headaches at times trying to read the fine print, but fortunately, the story was good enough to keep me going. But honestly, authors, get with the times and stop trying to sell us this \\"retro\\" book nonsense about how a book isn't special unless it's packaged a certain way. Focus on what's important - the writing.<br /><br />But with that rant aside, if you're into physical books and have the eyes for it, I recommend picking up a copy of Joyland for yourself. It's a great quick read (another first for King in awhile!) and the story will have you turning the pages well after midnight.ort of special language that people who work in the carnival and amusement business have that is uniquely their own.

B009LMTDL0|3.0|As a new mom, and someone who has built a career in a male dominated industry (tech) performing a male dominated role (sales), I thought I might gain personally and professionally from Sheryl Sandberg's sage advice.  I applaud Ms. Sandberg for drawing attention to the lack of women in the C-suite.  However, I don't fully buy into her argument that the lack of powerful women in the business world can be chalked up to the fact that we &#34;Lean Out&#34; to pursue motherhood or a better work/life balance.<br /><br />Go to any corporate web page, click &#34;leadership/about us&#34; and you'll almost always see a line-up of smiling (white) men with maybe one woman as head of HR or Marketing.  And that's the first problem.  CEO's typically come from Finance/Sales/Operations, roles that add to the bottom line and therefore are more visible.  These roles at major corporations are almost without fail, dominated by men.  Rather than encourage women to pursue roles that have a measurable impact to revenues (and are therefore more likely to lead to additional career opportunities), Ms. Sandberg chalks up the lack of lady leadership to the fact that we &#34;Lean Out&#34; to become wives and mothers.  Not an inaccurate argument but not exactly groundbreaking either.<br /><br />Save yourself the time/money/effort of reading this book and YouTube her TED speech.  After all, there aren't enough hours in the day for us career gals.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|this product was much smaller than I thought it would be will not buy again very disappointing for the price I paid for the product
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Now I can look at my tablet and see how much time is left before I have to plug it in and not just the percent of battery left. It took the guesswork out. I like this app.
B005KJJ4F8|2.0|This book was ok. An interesting take on the Cinderella fairy tale, the story looses out by its predictable &#34; twists&#34; that attempt at originality. Bummer.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another great book in the series.  Love Gideon and am rooting for him and Eva.  Cruel thing to leave the ending hanging with no known release date for next book. I want to read it NOW!  I like the way the previous books are brought up so I can remember all that happened, just hurry up with next book, I still can't believe the ending with so much going on.  Gideon and Eva are a great couple and the book is just as HOT as the other two books.  Please get busy on the next in the series and thanks for another great read!
B003EY62II|4.0|4 yr old grandson loved this. And I've gotten in the habit of watching with him!  Well written movie. Watch it.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|Lame, unguided. This movie needs much help. What are Zombies anyway? And why doesn't the airplane fly anyhow? Where are all the dogs?
B004YESKU0|5.0|what's not to love? every disk even has the inserts from the cd's. you will not be disappointed if you are a SOAD fan!
0525478817|5.0|This book just blew me away. I truly fell in love with both Hazel and Augustus. I found myself laughing out loud a ton... considering this book is about young people with cancer. But I also found myself mourning and reflecting on those teenage years and young love.<br /><br />Loved this book, loved the dialogue, can't speak it's praises enough.
193700788X|5.0|I LOVE EVERY THING CHARLAINE HARRIS WRITES . I AM SO SORRY TO BE READING THE  LAST SOOKIE BOOK. I WILL MISS ALL OF HER ADVENTURES IN THE STRANGE TOWN OF BON TEMP . LA.
0321811984|5.0|The definitive book on designing the best presentations you have in you. Garr leaves nothing out. Also check out his Ted talk at Ted.com.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This is a great device for boosting the sound of an ipod if your headphones don't seem to be loud enough for some reason or another.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT NOT, A DAC AMP TO POWER EXPENSIVE HEADPHONES.<br /><br />I made that mistake when buying as a newbie audiophile. It does not properly power the headphones, and therefor does not increase sound quality. By expensive, I'm talking $200+, models like AKG, Grado, Sennheiser ect. You will need a headphone amp like the Nuforce IDO $149.99 (ipods only) or a FiiO DAC amp which is between $80-150 to solve this issue, and they are much more expensive, but the only option.<br /><br />Now back to this item; I found great use for it later on when one of my headphones seemed to be too quiet at max volume. Just plug this in and the headphones picked up the sound normally without audible distortion. The bass and treble settings are also pretty nice.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love it, but it shouldn't be worth 99&cent;. It has all the quality I need and is great. I really like it.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|I ordered it for my iPad and paid for it, but I never got it.<br />What can I do? Roswitha Mcintosh
0240815807|5.0|Really good book, learned a lot from it. Mike Senior is a great author. I really recommend this book for anyone intersted for real on mixing.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Had looked forward to this. It's kind of like a remake to me of the old movie &#34;The Running Man&#34;.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|I heard &#34;Sweater Song&#34; and &#34;Afraid&#34; on Pandora... and I loved those two songs. When I got the CD... I didn't have really high standards for it... however the rest of the tracks blew my mind!! The lyrics are amazing and emotional and the instrumentals are phenomenal!! I would DEFINITELY recommend the purchase of this CD!!
B0083Z6AH6|2.0|Thls story could have been written better. It was a very difficult read. Story was very confusing at different times in the book.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I really like the app its really easy to use and has some pretty cool things on it. you should really get it it tells you how much more time and battery life you have left. pretty cool.
B009H442DG|2.0|Love ONJ, not her best. Would not recommend but happy money goes to charity. Would not have purchased if could have reviewed a sampling of the songs first.
B007FROH4G|5.0|It was a very moving book so sad, it gave a good insight into the lives of people dealing with dementia
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book has gotten a lot of bad reviews...I totally understand them, but don't agree with some.  I, like so many, have waited and waited and waited for this book to come out.  The first two made this series one of my two faves...right along with 50 Shades.  I am disappointed with the book...I can't lie.  It was well written...I do love the way Sylvia Day writes.  I've read other books by her and love the way they make me feel.  I feel like she stayed true with this book.  I didn't hate Eva as a lot of folks have.  She's messed up...broken.  They both are.  They struggle.  I too feel like maybe she's drawing it out because of her success with this series.  I think it  could've ended just fine in this book.  Actually, I'm okay with the ending.  They got their happy ending as far as I'm concerned.  I don't care about Corinne or Nathan.  He's dead...she's on the crazy train.  So, even though the books will continue because she has introduced new plot lines and continued old ones, I don't feel like I HAVE to read anymore.  Will I get the next book?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  We will see.  But I won't eagerly anticipate and impatiently wait for it.  And, lastly, I don't feel like this one was worth the price tag.  I know WHY it was priced that high...I just know I've read better for less.  But I encourage everyone to make their own decisions about this book...
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|I love this Album great job on time with the shipping. slipknot is a great band and cyberzoo is  the place to get this if you want it
0812550706|4.0|I was much more interested in the dynamics of the family explored in this book than in the gaming portion.<br />The older brother is a portrait of the killers we see acting out in real life in a chilling fashion. Without this<br />interplay among Ender and his sister and his brother, it wouldn't not be as good. As it is, we get an<br />interesting sci fi book with depth.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Very nice, yet simple battery app, can display percentage on status bar, graphics are nice, but not many options to customise or change much. Small memory footprint, so that's nice too...
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was a hard book to read, because it's difficult knowing it is true. I finished the book quickly because it was all so unbelievable! Its wonderful how positive Jaycee is and I think it's a great book for anyone to read.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Not only should everyone in America read Salt Sugar Fat, but it should be required. Moss details the processed food industry, breaking down its contribution to the modern obesity crisis. The reporting is meticulous in detailing the rise of the corporate food giants and the tricks they use to entice consumers to their unhealthy products. Moss exposes how processed foods are loaded with extras to create an addictive bliss point, making them almost drug-like in their allure. Not only that, but he likewise details the excessive advertising and marketing (much directed at children) used to lure customers. Worst of all, he even gets some food executives to admit they don't eat their company's own products. The book leads to the unavoidable conclusion that the processed food industry's race to the bottom (at Wall Street's behest) has caused a public health crisis in America. Amazing five star reporting. By far, Salt Sugar Fat is the best book I've read this year.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack joyride is super fun and addicting. It never gets old or boring. It's got tons of fun missions and jetpack. Get this app now:)
B009NY43NY|5.0|If you like the southern vampire stories of Charlaine Harris, you'll enjoy this book. In truth, I like the books much better than the NBO series.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is super fun and never gets old. I recommend it to anyone who likes fun games. Get it now!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Enjoyed thus version more than the regular (first) version.the bright Colors were a bit easier to see. The music was not distracting.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Bad piggies is super addicting and fun. It never gets old. You should get this app now and start enjoying an the best game ever.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is a great game.  My wife and I play almost nightly.  The best part of this game is it is always changing. The only down fall is that it can only be 4 players and we often have more than that.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Great book with many examples about how we create habits and how we can change them. Clear and easy to read.
B008476HBM|1.0|there are some words out of order! it's a mess!!<br />please take back this publication from the site or get it fixed!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I think this is the best season of the good wife! I've watched all the episodes many times. If you haven't seen the show, I highly recommend it. The writing and acting is marvelous.
B00AS1Q8FW|2.0|For someone who has read all the novels, starting with One Shot (which this film is based on), I felt cheated. I was expecting the drifter Jack Reacher to be 6'5\\", 250lbs, and barely able to use a cell phone; none of which Tom Cruise portrayed. While the acting itself was OK, I'm disappointed that Lee Child gave so much leeway to the studios for this film.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars for the acting, in that the actors did the job they were paid to do.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Ok I hated the ending, it was so open ended.  I don't like books that end like that I like to know what happens.  Not sure what the point of Julian was in the book as he didn't really play a part.  Overall I guess a good conclusion to the trilogy.
B007S3S8HO|5.0|I got this for my son's 5th birthday. I helped him build it and he had a lot of fun destroying it. He's a huge angry birds fan, so this was a great addition to his collection. The only thing I find a little annoying is that the cars don't connect together so they fall apart easily. The blocks just sit on top of each other, then you put them on top of the wheels. Other than that this is a pretty cool little game.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|I saw this movie years ago when it came out and decided to watch it again. I love it now as much as the day I saw it. So funny. George Clooney is fantastic!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Though some may say it's boring, predictable, or that it feeds on the misery of other people's lives, I think this is a sweet, beautiful documentary. It perfectly depicts the need to love and feel loved, with the advantages and challenges of newer means of communication.<br /><br />It is true that the trailer portrayed it as a thriller, which was definitely not, but there is no reason to feel disappointed--a bit more research is enough to know what one will be getting into when renting this movie. I did my research and knew what to expect to a certain extent. The rest, was amazement. I was amazed by the beauty, the candor, the fragility of this documentary and I highly recommend it.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|The graphics are very nice.  The screen freezes occasionally and you have to restart the app.  Too hard to accumulate the points to upgrade armour unless you purchase them and what you get for the cost isn't much.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm behind the curve but I started watching Downton Abbey about 2weeks ago and haven't been able to stop. It's a Great show with intriguing characters and a well developed story line!!
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|This game is annoying the vehicles cost so much money.And you cant tilt so if you go of a hill and you start to flip you cant stop it
B009LXEBD4|5.0|What a great GREATEST HITS MIX!! Everything is on there that I love of Kelly Clarkson. Plus Amazon was so quick to get this to me
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I never get tired of reading something by Michael Connelly.  I especially like the Mickey Haller stories.  They rate right up there with John Grisham.  You don't want to put the book down because something might happen while you're gone.
B007HO392S|5.0|I'm so blown away with the mix of music on this tape. It's all good! Amazon is so quick. I hardly had to wait at all for the CD to get to me
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|While requiring a constant internet connection lest Disney miss even a second of real-time data mining,ad blasting or opportunities to entice children to purchase ridiculously expensive upgrade packs. There was a time when Disney at least attempted to maintain the illusion that the sole reason for their existence was something other than shaking every dime out Mr. &amp; Mrs. Joe Sixpack at the behest of their infatuated toddlers. Now they're flagrantly in your face about it, so they get a star for honesty.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|With so many levels to play, you can play this game a long time.  Also with the different difficulties everyone in the family feels challenged.  I get going and totally lose track of time.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I loved this book because of its writing. Each chapter leaves you  hanging at the end ans th  next chapter begins from a different vantage point. Must read!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Excellent app, does exactly what it says, many settings to show battery life for different uses on Kindle Fire HD,ie Music, Browsing, Reading, Viewing eh x,
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Acting on all parts is magnificent.  I have been racing through this series and will have to view a 2nd time.  I love British drama. This is very addictive.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I can never get enough of Nalini Singh. Her books rock they grab you and suck you into a whole nother world.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Clean and low profile.  One thing that would make it  better would be a widget option rather than a notification.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|keeps mind going its fun cause me n my daughter play to see who can get hugest level the fastest lol
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like the app it's really simple and easy to use and understand. I am going to add it to my collection of free apps I have gotten so far from amazon.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I wish I could get my money back! What a horrible book.  There was no plot, no story line.  Eve and Gideon had the same type of issues and conversations as the last two books.  I kept wait for something interesting to happen, and then all of a sudden, the book ended! It took forever for this book to come out and with so much anticipation - what a disappointment!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Ok, I'm a little new to the various ways all this technology works. I have an accuweather app for my smartphone. It has 3 dimensional pictures of the weather. It looks very cool, actually. My son in particular loves it. So I purchased the app for his kindle. However, on the kindle there are just still photos. Not very stunning. So I guess the 3-d imagery is something only done for smartphones. So I downloaded another weather app with the 3-d pictures. Since my five year old is not concerned with reading the weather report so much as he likes looking at pictures of clouds & thunderstorms.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Pudding Monsters is an engaging game :-D Like other Zeptolab games, it gets more tricky w each level.  Fun puzzle game!
1439102813|5.0|My mother had Alzheimer's and was in professional care settings for 10 years.  I often wondered what was going on in her mind, and while I realize this story is a  work of fiction, I found it helpful and somewhat comforting.  It is very profound and insightful, and Lisa Genova does an excellent job of making this story very realistic.  I recently received my Bachelor degree in Social Work, and gave this particular copy to my social work field instructor as a parting gift when my internship ended.  He was very impressed with the book and will be recommending it to his students that he teaches each semester in Introduction to Social Work.  It is a great story for anyone to read, but especially touching to anyone who knows someone with Alzheimer's.
0143142364|5.0|Ken Follett's Trilogy is among my favorite books.  Great story and you learn a lot about history.  I highly recommend it.
B005I4JG80|5.0|As a teacher of French, I really appreciate the way this book has been written. In outlining the enormous differences between our cultures, the author succeeds in suggesting both cultures act they way they do because of innate cultural, historical, and sociological background, and not because one is superior to the other. I found, as a mother, some very good ideas, as well as some moments where I realized I could never be French. A wonderful, thought-provoking read!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I rated this series 5 stars because it is a great story, well written and the acting is outstanding. I watch my DVD over and over. There is always something there that I did not see before.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is a great game except the fact that all my friends have the update 7.0 and I don't have it please update it!
B003INBOE2|5.0|I got around to finally seeing this and must say I've become a big Donnie Yen fan. The movie based on the real life Ip Man was done excellent and the fight scenes were second to none. It was a real treat to hear the various actors nd director for their take on the movie and working with each other.<br /><br />Two of those \\"behind the scenes' stood out and made me appreciate the movie even more...<br /><br />Donnie Yen had to learn the Wing Chun style of fighting from scratch.He was so thurough in research, studing and doing the Wing Chun moves that traditional practionist of Wing Chun were so impressed with his demostration in front of them they thought he had been doing it for years. He got all \\"108\\" moves done on the Wooden Wing Tsun Dummy right.<br /><br />Second was the actor who protrays the Kung Fu Japaneese General in the movie, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi didn't know much of actual Martial Art like Kung Fu and Wing Chun. He does hold a Black Belt in Judo<br /><br />I guess I'll snag Ip Man 2 after seeing this one...well worth it for any martial art movie fan.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the game but hare the invest points! if you could buy them with in-game money, I would like it and play it MUCH, MUCH more!!!  Remove the cost of invest points!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book scares you and yet it gives you hope. Life in a secured silo and great characters make for an entertaining and thoughtful read. I am hooked Hugh Howey!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Most shotum up shows grow old. This is more involved and the characters are more complex. Fun to watch and have a good summer
B007GCY8FS|5.0|There was a lot of computations including time, mileage, etc. in the beginning which might be interesting to<br />some people.  However, when the story really took off it was vintage Reacher.  He's a great super-hero.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|This is my favorite show. I have the box set, but a couple of my season 5 DVDs got scratched. I bought this to replace mine, and these are better quality!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|An amazing app for twitter users!! This app is very similar to the apple's app! Very easy to use! I love this app I  use it all the time!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|This was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish!  The casting was excellent.<br />I am so sad and disappointed beyond words this show is being cancelled!!! So many<br />others far less qualified are to continue.....something is VERY wrong here.  PLEASE<br />RECONSIDER...
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Though DeMille tells a very serious story of anti-terrorism, his main character has a dry and sarcastic sense of humor I love to read.
B007IK44CK|4.0|It has a few twists just when you think the movie is over.  Good action movie. Eye candy for both sexes.
B004R6JG7G|5.0|This movie is very good and i have always loved tom cruise, and I hope he gets real and make more movies that are more horror base and focus on getting his home life in order.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It's really great and easy to program. The alarm sound options offer sounds that will wake you up but are not jarring.
B00992CF6W|3.0|My son loves this game. Unfortunatelly can't play with him any more the multiplayer because I updated mine through the playstore and my son's nabi has the only option to get apps through the amazon appstore. 5 stars when the amazon's version gets the update
B00140PK6O|5.0|This is great series starter. I am looking forward to acquiring all seasons.  Very pleased with the the purchasing process and delivery expectations!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I won't be able to say enough good things about this game.  It's smooth, responsive, gorgeous and additive on my Note II.  A shooter that, for a welcome change, isn't clunky and hard to control.  After scoring an awesome 100k points in my second attempt I passed it to my son for a challenge.  On *his* second try, he got 2 million points :)  sigh.  If 2d space shooters are fun for you, then grab this, it's way worth the money.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I look forward to watching the entire series.  My family and I really enjoy the characters and the story line.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|It's not flashy graphics, just good solid game play that keeps me coming back for more. It combines a match 3 approach with rpg character development and dungeon crawler tasks. There are lots of those tasks too. They give nice rewards and they arrive when you can handle them. The randomness of the tiles means some levels will end frustratingly early.  The beauty of this game is that you just jump back in and run again, keeping all the gains you have made.  It's got a well balanced approach that reflects a lot of care on the part of the developers.  If timed games frustrate you, you might want to play it on someone else's phone before you buy.  Now signing off to go see if EightyEight Games has any more titles :)
B002SAUCBC|4.0|Stephen King once again mastered in this short story. His narrative and writing style are superb, catching the reader from the benning to the end. By the way, I was a little disappointed with the end of the story (the reason why I ranked it with 4 stars), but it is far from compromising this very good read.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Aside from there not being very many famous actors or well known actors, this was a good movie to watch. The story line was interesting and not like very many movies that are out now which I liked. Awesome effects and liked that it wasn't too much about the love story.
1781162646|5.0|I don't normally review, but I wanted to give 5 stars to a deserving 5 star novel, in the least to help boost overall rating that is lacking do to jabroni's crying about no e-book.<br /><br />Reviewers have gone into plot in depth, and I think it is best to avoid as much as possible.  Let the story come to you, don't go and find it.  Under the Dome, Full Dark, 11/23/63, Joyland, King is back in full force!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love sufer because if u die u can always keep going with the keys it's awesome<br /><br />It's perfect tricks is so pretty
1250012570|4.0|The book was the complete and total opposite of what I expected it to be. A typical high school romance was what my standards were for beginning this book. However Eleanor & Park is far from that. The book travels through the families in a time when people were struggling to find normalcy and the characters are caught up in that. Overall I liked the book but I did not necessarily &#34;love&#34; it. Eleanor's character throughout the book is hard to love and yet you feel cold hearted if you don't. While Park is just an innocent dealing with his affections for Eleanor and wondering if they will ever be returned in the way that he wants.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|me like game! it is good game! you play game too. me like muffins this game has no muffins!!! it need muffins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00511ONPG|5.0|I picked Likeable Social Media early this year to be the textbook of the Social Media class I was teaching this summer. I actually bought several Social Media books, but this one was my favorite, so this is the one I picked for my class. I started re-reading this book in May, following up the same chapters I was giving my students to read every week. Last night was the last night of class, and also when I finished re-reading it. It's a fantastic read if you're interested in learning more about Social Media. I wouldn't exactly recommend this to a newbie, but if you are in Marketing or Communication, or manages a business, this book has a lot of practical ideas you can implement on your marketing strategies. My favorite part of this book? How the author used Facebook Ads to create a super target ad to reach only ONE person, his wife.
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|Liked when I saw it theaters it has a very interesting view and way of showing the story for adult addicense can't wait too get my copy soon. Dee
B008V8FVTI|4.0|The plot is very good and the roles are very well played out. I don't like the idea of a catholic priest lying to get redemption but it's entertaining. I've seen this movie more than twice.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best horse game I have ever played on the kindle. It's so realistic I could play it all day.! I love it
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Anyone interested in finding out the atrocities that happen in North Korea should read this book.  The story keeps you engaged, horrified, and amazed that this man was able to make it out of such an awful place and live to tell about it.  Unbelievable to think of how much the human body can withstand.
B00008G8M4|5.0|from start to finish, the viewer is mesmerized by the special effects, if you don't have this in your collection, then get it, here at least
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I felt badly for Jamie but I did enjoy reading the book.  He certainly went through a lot trying to find what he was looking for.
B002OR18HQ|5.0|Absolutely a fantastic DVD - the band the songs are what you would expect from Fogerty - wish we can get more of this
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Definitely worth watching. Haven't read the book, but loved the script and cinematography. We definitely laughed out loud while watching this film; the one-liners are great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is the second installment in the Hunger Games trilogy and it is riveting! I am absorbed in its intriguing characters, it's rich settings and the sheer overall flavor of the book. This is storytelling at its best!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|This is Star Wars. It does have some minor additions (some are good, like the scenes added for the space battles, and others not so good, like the CGI Jabba in episode IV) but, overall, I love these movies... their essence continues to be magical, without boundaries, great chemistry between characters, awesome locations and a great philosophy. I watched these movies when I was a kid in Betamax and everyday I continue to be amazed by this galaxy far far away...
1452101248|5.0|I don't think I know enough superlatives to begin to describe this book. The book itself is beautiful and the recipes are beyond wonderful. every one that I have tried has become my new favorite recipe, that is a contradiction. Buy this book and begin cooking on an enhanced level. If you have heard good things about this book.....consider the comments understatements.

1476734941|3.0|My husband and I tried this diet with great enthusiasm and were successful for a couple months. It wasn't too hard at first and we lost an average of 8 pounds each.  The problem? With time, our resolve and hunger pangs on our restricted diet days, have increased.  For LONG TERM GAINS, which I believe everyone wants, you will need ongoing, serious commitment.  Sadly, I don't think that this is easier than any other proven diet plan.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a fun game to pass time, just challenging enough to make me think on a couple of levels but not enough to make me frustrated. I almost didn't get it after reading other reviews about in app purchasing but it's only for hints so doesn't take away from the game in my opinion.
0425263924|1.0|First, there were massive delays pushing this book's release date back six months.  Then, we are insulted with this piece of worthless crap?<br /><br />I was a HUGE fan of the first two books.  Couldn't put them down.  Drawn instantly in.  This book is an insult to any fan of the series.  She didn't even end this \\"trilogy\\"!  She's stretching out an already VERY thin plot for two more books?  It's obviously about the money and that is disgusting to me.<br /><br />Nothing happened in this book.  NOTHING.  She just brought up new story lines that no one cares anything about, didn't resolve anything with the story lines she already had and just bored her readers to tears.  Not to mention there is only so many time you can read the same scenes over and over and over and over again before you start to get bored.<br /><br />I couldn't put her other books down.  This one, I couldn't stay interested to save my life.<br /><br />Sorry Ms. Day, but you aren't getting anymore of my hard earned money, especially since you didn't earn it after this piece of disappointing crap.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|Just really can't get into this album as of this posting. Not saying it's a horriblae album it just hasn't struck the right chord with me yet. If your looking to put this CD in to cheer you up your barking up the wrong tree it is dark and gloomy and pretty much sounds like one long song. I'm a huge fan of Alice In Chains since they played the cathouse in L.A. this just doesnt do it for me at this time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Worth every penny. Graphics were great. Sound track was great. The atmosphere of the game made me want to play it more. Couldn't put it down. Wish it was longer.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Loved the actress, loved the film. Will recommend it to my grandchildren. Completely held my interest all the way through.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Sometimes reconnecting with an author is like rediscovering your childhood best friend.  I haven't read Archer since the 1990s and I'm so thrilled to have picked up The Clifton Chronicles.  Its full of adventure, romance and intrigue set against a historical background.  I'm waiting for the fourth installation -- and not very patiently!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This was a lot of fun! It's a mystery/object finding game. I was pulled in right away. I enjoy the graphics and the music too.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I have studied a lot about Abraham Lincoln and seen movies about him. This one is mostly about the politics behind the amendment to prohibit slavery. So glad they passed it, but it doesn't make a real riveting movie viewing. Never the less it is worth watching.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was amazing.  Captivating you and making you feel as though you were part of the story. Going to get more of this author.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|The walking dead that is. Several central characters bite the dust in this season. Won't tell you who or even what the guy at the CDC told Rick...Keep guessing...It is fun when you are on the right side of the TV screen.
B001OSIV62|5.0|I was mesmerized the entire time. Petit is an amazing storyteller and a very interesting person. This movie has it all.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I always loved Columbo. Not just one more thing...Well with this collection I have got it all and can watch it over and over again. Hey do you think Columbo knew when he kept pestering the killer or did he figure it out in the middle? I am still trying to decide.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My first Card experience, far from the last. One of my favorite authors. Ive read and re-read this dozens of times, and it still rings. Recommended.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Oh gosh! I am so glad it is fiction! How awful would it be to wake up and find the whole world had turned into Zombies? I haven't been this creeped out since I read &#34;I am Legend.&#34; Really not for the squeamish!
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Interesting digital future scenario, relatable well versed characters, fast paced plotline and Numerous references to pop culture. Couldn't put it down.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|It makes me feel like I am right there with the 'minions'. LOL It is a movie for adults and children too! I am not sure which I am but I do know it is the kind of movie I wouldn't mind playing over and over in the background it you know what I mean. It's got good music and a good story too! Oh Yeah!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Has plenty of room, even for my smaller camera bag to be stored within this bag. Loved the feature to hold the tripod on the side! I returned one twice as expensive bought at bestbuy.
0345803485|1.0|You know the hype. Everybody does. I had no intentions of reading this but I just kept hearing about it everywhere. After hearing about it from such a variety of people and finally seeing it as a suggestion for an author I love that is on the complete other side of the literary spectrum, I decided to buy it to see what the hype was all about. First of all, the main character in this book seriously annoys me. She acts like every girl that I can't stand. To me, she is the epitome of the immaturity you see today with people who have no idea how to communicate unless they are behind a computer or phone. She annoys me so much that I couldn't stand reading this book II didn't even think the sex scenes were good. People say that they get better as you get further in the series but I don't think you should have to wait that long in a romance book.  I stopped reading it about 3/4 of the way through. A lot of people also said this excited them and was great for their sex life. This book really didn't do anything for me but maybe I should just be grateful that I have such a great sex life and I have my own Christian that I don't need any help.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The continuing drama of the struggling relationship of Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell. They're the best and worst things that have ever happened to each other.<br /><br />Eva is still having trust issues, just like in books #1 & 2  [[ASIN:0425263908 Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel]] and  [[ASIN:0425263916 Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel]]... trying to learn to trust and believe in Gideons' faithfulness..and she's tortured with such a jealousy that it constantly casts suspicion upon every beautiful brunette female that Gideon talks to. She and Gideon are physically close (that's putting it mildly)...but always emotionally distant....however they're progressing in a positive way.  They're moving forward, albeit at a drunken snails pace.<br /><br />I LOVE Gideons' damaged soul. He's strong yet he's weak in no many instances. He has to have complete honesty, truth and trust from Eva. I LOVE his possessiveness of Eva. He has to be in total control. He's THE ultimate \\"control freak\\" - - he seldom bends. LOVE IT!!!...(but that's just me)<br /><br />Gideon and Eva's lives are fraught with drama...DAILY drama - - and it can get exhausting at times just reading about it - - seldom is there a peaceful moment between them. They both can read suspicion into the tiniest, most innocent issue/action. It's exhausting, true....but fascinating and exciting to watch these two tortured souls work through their issues and both grow towards each other. It's exhausting. It's crazy. It's great!!  Truthfully however, this third book could've been told in three chapters.  It's basically \\"a day in the life of\\" Eva and Gideon.<br /><br />Once again Cary's character steals a few scenes with his witty dialogue and comic-relief. He's such a messed up Sweetheart..ya gotta love him.<br /><br />I didn't love this third installment of the Crossfire Trilogy as much as the first two books.  And I still can't figure out why it's taken so long to deliver this book.  That being said, Ms. Day does a phenomenal job bringing sharp attention to detail.  She can describe in delicious inches, an erotic, romantic, intimate scene like no other.  She details each moment with an extra fine tooth comb.menal job bringing sharp attention to detail.

B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love this must have app. It shows and lets you know when and how long to charge. I'm happy I found this app and it couldn't get better. Thank you for this app. I give it a 5 star.
B000SEIDR0|4.0|Overall fairly well written.  The themes don't always transition smoothly, and the writing seems a bit contrived at times, but overall, it seems to be very well researched and I appreciated the spirit of its mission.  I'll read more by Michael Pollan.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A very good read. The book is hard to put down. Grisham keeps the action flowing from cover to cover. One of my favorite authors he did not disappoint once again
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was so intense and jaw dropping every single chapter. Never knew what was coming next. Amazing!<br />I recommend for a great read to anyone!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|5 Freakin Stars for this book. Eva and Gideon move closer to each other. The feelings and emotions are raw and they now have a deeper connection to each other. The relationship has grown and they communicate so well in this book that you almost feel like you are in the relationship with them when they \\"talk about\\" whatever is bother them. This book has alot of new developments in it. You will read about the murder and Gideon and Eva's feeling over it and the drama attached to that. The detectives are also in this book with new developments. Eva's father comes to visit and is truly hurt and Eva has to deal with that. Eva has issues with her mother in this book. There are ex's to deal with for both Gideon and Eva and you'll see how that affects both of them and how they deal with it. This book has alot in it and kept me on my toes!<br /><br />AAGGHH.... however, I thought this was a triolgy and this was the this book would have a great ending. Only to be left wondering about many, many things. Apparently, according to the author on the page after the ending she states that there will be another book to find out what happens in Eva and Gideons life.  She left so many things up in the air and I wish that it had not been marketed at a trilogy because I was anxious for the book to have an ending to remember.
B002V9PEUE|4.0|I have seen this movie several times and actually met Sly personally as he used to be a client. I came from the cold north of the USA and never climbed mountains but I did understand what cold was like! Enjoyable film to watch, good colors and great action.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved it. The human spirit persevering thru the darkest times.  More please, what do I read next?<br /><br />Really thought out
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|this game is wonderful... cute and silly with a great puzzle format. i think i like this more than cut the role. elegant transitions and tutorial animations.
1845767055|5.0|and this book is INCREDIBLE.  Fantastic collection and I often have it open first thing in the morning.  Thumbing through all the wonderful art as a way to get me inspired for the day.  There's process sketches, character designs, DINOSAURS, and of course, fabulous illustrations.  Lots and lots to keep your jaw to the ground.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|Hours and hours of creativity. My children are enjoying them, they are well made and even my husband and I are having fun with them.
0679805273|5.0|I purchased this book to have each of my son's teachers sign.  I dropped the book off at his school's front desk and picked it up after his teacher signed it.  It will be fun to present it to him once he has graduated from high school.
B0081X8AE6|4.0|His range is on display here and he is really good at many things. He has the whole package melody and lyrics.  Great freshman effort. If you get a chance go see him in concert this summer.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I could not put this book down. The book was excellent and kept me entertained and wanting more. An incredible story about two of WWII's many brave men. I look forward to reading more from this author.
B00BB22GQM|3.0|Is one of those tricky things, when writing a book it can be done from afar with some very good results.  In music that approach is hit and miss.  They went that way with this song set and it shows.  While at least half the songs have great energy, the other half feels much less spontaneous and engaging.  Spontaneous energy really was their key ingredient up to this point.  Good effort, still worth a listen
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|with a slight dearth of movies to rent lately i was waiting impatiently for Warm Bodies to be released for rental.  perhaps the drought had influenced my perception that this could, in fact, be good.  the reality is that it is not.  as much as i wanted it to be, i had to resort to watching it with &#34;alternative entertainment&#34;...which means I picked up the sewing machine and started sewing.  not something i like to do, so it had to be bad.  i am a big zombie fan and i couldn't get the whole zombie thing going with this one.  at the end, for some reason, the sight of couples holding hands starts zombies on the road to recovery.  why?  no idea.  why would this girl want to kiss a zombie with brains in his mouth?  no idea.  supposedly they have a connection and yes he has saved her, but his breath has to smell like stale body parts.  i did like that you see zombies or &#34;corpses&#34; coming together at the end for a mutual purpose other than dinner.  still, happy Zombie Support Groups are not enough to save this film.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game is just as you expect except for handling the cards. A classic game with all the variables/choices. A pleasant way to spend some time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is totally addicting,  relaxing, &amp; fun. I would recommend it for all ages especially for young children that are hard to keep busy.
B0093BUWGE|5.0|It's neo-soul meets jazz.  This is definitely an album that I can listen to beginning to end.  No skipper songs on this one.<br />The arrangements are tasty!
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Queens of The Stone Age's &#34;...Like Clockwork&#34; finds the band charting a slight change in course from earlier, more raucous fare like 2007's Era Vulgaris. The change in tactics, ramping up the bands' inherent dreamy, sinister quality, while scaling back the sheer hard rock drive, serves the band well right away, opening track &#34;Keep Your Eyes Peeled&#34; starts with a none-more-dark funereal stomp, but moves into lightning stabs of noise before climaxing in comfortable Queens style, voices chiming in from the ether while guitars burr and hum. The second track, &#34;I Sat by the Ocean&#34; is reminiscent of 2005's &#34;Lullabies to Paralyze&#34; overlooked track &#34;Broken Box&#34; with it's stop-start musical hook, but the payoff is better this time around, with Queens leader Josh Homme bringing an irresistible hook to the table that makes the song bloom. One of the three overtly riff-driven tunes on the album, &#34;If I Had a Tail&#34;, gets by on its slinky, scary, sexy groove, while mining a HUGE chorus that gut-punches like the Queens of old.<br />But, Mr. Homme has moved on from the grind of the bands earlier catalog. &#34;Kalopsia&#34;, a beautifully written ballad disguised as a multi-part prog rock song. Lead single &#34;My God is the Sun&#34; takes the bands' penchant for playing with time signatures to the limit while nailing a big earworm of a hook. &#34;Smooth Sailing &#34; is classic Queens funk, a la &#34;I'm Designer&#34; or &#34;Leg of Lamb&#34;, a spindly, warbly guitar teetering underneath Homme's able falsetto (which is displayed with more conviction and confidence, I believe, on this album than on others.)<br />The bottom line of &#34;...Like Clockwork&#34; is, while it maybe slightly more subdued than earlier outings by this legendary desert rock band, the calmness of the arrangements lets Josh Homme's songwriting shine through, and when given the opportunity, these songs shine like few others in the Queens catalog. And, the albums length (a just-right 46 minutes) helps keep the collection focused. This record deserves to stand by their first three albums as one of their finest works.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Great game. If cute creature arcade puzzle is ur thing, this game's for u. I wouldn't compare it with om -nom here, another of my favorites. But worth your bucks. I got it for free in a promotion!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OMG! This book ia AMAZING, totally worth the waiting! Gideon is the always caring, loving and sexy  boyfriend, he does the possible and the impossible for Eva. It's a brilliant continuation of the others books .More drama, stressful moments, happy moments and really HOT moments too.<br />We have the possibility to know more about Gideon past and the way it influences his present, I see also a stronger  and more mature Eva.<br />The way this history develops is so unpredictable and full of surprises. I loved every moment!!<br />Don't miss it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|definatly would recommend this game to any horse lover's out there. if I had more freids wit kindles inwould have them play it for sure.
B00BJUQP4A|4.0|I was a little surprised there wasn't much writing but the pictures were wonderful.  Made me re-evaluate what makes me happy in life, doing things with my dog.
B0061S073A|2.0|First off, I want to say that I do use the FreeTime app to keep my kids from getting all over the place.  However, the problem with FreeTime, is that they don't allow me to let my kids watch the Personal Videos I upload, nor does it let them look at the photos on my Kindle (which they like to do).  So that's how I came across this app.<br /><br />There are many glitches.  I have NO idea how, but somehow my daughter was able to access my music through the app (which is not supposed to be allowed).  On another occasion (again when I was not looking), she somehow got OUT of the app.  Those things only happened those two times, but I assume there was some kind of glitch because I don't think my 2 year old toddler would be able to accidentally hit our PIN and then my parental controls password....TWICE.  And it was during one of those times that she de-registered my Kindle and I just don't want to go through the hassle of re-registering it again.<br /><br />But the bigger problems are:<br /><br />1)  It won't allow me to put the FreeTime app in - they can't access their apps and books in the FreeTime app; and<br /><br />2)  Even though I specifically clicked \\"Allow Internet Connection\\" in the settings, IT DOES NOT ALLOW INTERNET CONNECTION.  I've tried unselecting it, and getting out of the app, and turning it back on, etc.  Nothing works to get past this stupid problem.  So not only can they not access much of the things I want them to access, every time I exit out of the app, I have to turn the wifi back on.<br /><br />This is extremely irritating because it makes the app semi-pointless because now the only things that this app is good for (in my case anyway) is to keep my kids from getting out of the Personal Videos and Photos and into something else without me knowing.  If they want to use to play with their apps, I have to actually take them out of Kids Place, and open up FreeTime and vice versa.<br /><br />I don't understand why FreeTime doesn't allow us to add ourPersonal Videos and Photos.  If it did, I wouldn't have sought out this app.  And unfortunately, this app only does the things that FreeTime doesn't.  If I can find a better parental control app that does both, then I'm certainly uninstalling this app.  Until then, I'm stuck with using both FreeTime and this app together (as irritating as it is).
B000YAA68C|5.0|I can seriously watch this movie over and over and over again... The moral of the story is great. I'm usually not a big Hilary Swank fan, but she is great in this movie (and so isn't Gerard of course!) Be sure to have a box of tissues next to you. I started watching this movie at a friends house one day, but had to stop it and buy it immediately because I knew my boyfriend would want to watch it, and he loved it! Highly recommend you watching this movie :)

B002YVAT72|5.0|Raves for ION Profile & EZ-Vinyl Converter software! It not only works, it works flawlessly! Can't beat it. I'm a old-timer recording studio and audio equipment techie head, and this is a simply wonderful converter kit. It converts my old 45's and albums, and lets me tweak out any startup troubles with a disk or a track, before recording, without loosing my place in the track lineup. I highly recommend this product & software for anyone thinking about moving your old records to iTunes.<br /><br />Update After 3 weeks of use -- I have had 0 troubles with this setup.  Just upgraded the Mac software from version 10 to 11 and 0 hiccups there. I have noticed some reviewers saying they are dissatisfied with the turntable construction and/or level of technology. So I lined up something better. My test of course pertains to my Ion Profile Pro but would be applicable to any Ion turntables with auxiliary line inputs like the Profile Pro, I tested with a Stanton T.62 / Shure M97 cartridge, using an inexpensive Pyle Audio preamp into the Tape-input of the Ion Turntable. Guess what? Works great, which for all the audiophile types out there if you have high-end preconditioning gear it's all still a snap. The Ion Audio USB vinyl conversion system is just the best going, for ease of use and bang for the buck, if all you want to do is get that precious vinyl onto a Mac or PC.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I've had two firsts today. 1) Getting a refund for a book; and 2) writing a negative review on a book. I have been waiting for EWY for months. I was excited about learning Gideon's past and his family dynamics, understanding why he was so damaged, then seeing Eva help him pull it altogether with her love and support. That was not what book #3 offered. It was a disconnected thought that just didn't fall into place. I felt I was being pressured into caring about supporting cast members that I had no interest in. I can't believe I'm saying this but there was too much sex and too many declarations of love. I probably wouldn't have felt that way if the other part of the book was a plot that moved Gideon and Eva's story forward. I was disappointed and felt like the book fell flat and ended abruptly. It seemed as if it was mid-sentence when the author said that to get more you have to pay more. I love the first two books and the characters that they were in those books. I will probably read the last book to find out about Gideon, but it will be from a library for free. The publisher pushed the dates back a couple of times and decided to prolong the series, which was a surprise and quite irritating to me. (I don't think I need to follow her on fb or twitter to feel cheated on that point.)I feel bad for the Sylvia Day, I think she got bad advice and lost some fans. I hope it was worth it in the end.

B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)<br /><br />As a long-time Trekker, I don't have the many problems with the new incarnation that some do. I like this new cast, and the films are undeniably entertaining, even if it isn't exactly the Star Trek I used to know and love. Philosophy, ethical debates and the merits of intelligence have largely gone out the window in favor of slam-bang action and cowboy heroics. Still, the original Star Trek always contained some of the latter, so it isn't as jarring a change as it would be if, say Picard and crew starting indiscriminately kicking @$$ and taking names.<br /><br />Star Trek Into Darkness picks up a year (four years in real time) after the events of the first reboot, in which young Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and the Enterprise crew managed to save Earth from vengeful renegade Romulans. During that time, James T. Kirk, while undeniably talented in the Captain's chair, has still not fully understood the responsibility that comes with sitting in it. After a mission to save a primitive race ends up with Kirk violating the Prime Directive, he is demoted in rank--thanks to an incident report filed by Spock (Zachary Quinto)--and assigned to serve as first officer to his mentor, Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), who will be resuming command of the Enterprise. Meanwhile, devastating acts of terrorism committed by mysterious former Starfleet operative John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) have rocked their largely peaceful society. During an emergency meeting called to deal with the latest attack, Harrison ambushes Starfleet headquarters and causes the death of much of Starfleet's key personnel, including Admiral Pike. Enraged and seeking vengeance, Kirk corners Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) and volunteers to lead a manhunt for Harrison into the Neutral Zone and beyond, to Qo'noS (Kronos), the homeworld of the mysterious Klingon Empire. But what Kirk doesn't know is that there is more to \\"John Harrison\\" than meets the eye...<br /><br />Might as well get to it... **MANY SPOILERS AHEAD**<br /><br />So it's not really a spoiler, everyone knows by now that \\"John Harrison\\" is just a cover identity for none other than one Khan Noonien Singh. If you only know Benedict Cumberbatch from BBC's Sherlock, prepare to be mesmerized as he kicks all manner of ass here playing the Trek universe's preeminent villain. I do think J.J. Abrams and company could have tried a little harder to find someone who is not a pasty Englishman to play Khan, one of the more important characters in Trek lore; Sendhil Ramamurthy (\\"Heroes\\") comes to mind as a good candidate, an actual Indian. However, at the end of the day the performance is what really matters, and Cumberbatch gives a terrific one. (I mean, he's no Montalban, but then who is?) Unfortunately, there is no explanation as to why Khan looks so different, coming from an era before the timeline was altered.<br /><br />Khan's presence here, of course, means plenty of \\"homages\\" and reworkings of famous scenes from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, including a reversal of Spock's poignant death scene. Here, it's Kirk who selflessly sacrifices himself for the sake of the crew, while his friend Spock looks on helplessly. It's an iffy thing, recreating one of the best-known and most emotional scenes in all of Trek, and they almost pull it off except for two factors, a combination of bad writing and misplaced fan service:<br /><br />The first is some clumsy foreshadowing earlier in the film where McCoy (Karl Urban) is experimenting on a dead Tribble using some of Khan's blood, which now has some incredible healing properties apparently...? Someone asks him what he's doing, and he says, basically, \\"Oh, I'm just experimenting with this dead Tribble [for no logical reason] using this blood, it's got the most amazing regenerative properties I've ever seen, blah blah blah\\"; it's inserted so awkwardly into the ongoing action that even newbies will think, \\"Hmm, gee, I wonder if THAT information is going to be important later?\\" Meanwhile, members of the audience who've seen Wrath of Khan already are now ten steps ahead of the film and know exactly where this is going.<br /><br />The second (and the worst moment of the film, for my money) comes after Kirk has succumbed to radiation and Spock, mute with rage, looks at his now-dead friend, then screams \\"KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!\\" Words can't accurately convey just how convey how goofy this moment is, how much it damages the emotion of that moment. I get why they put it in; it's one of the key things, if not THE key thing, that most people remember from Wrath of Khan, and they were going to shoehorn it in somewhere. And yes, sometimes fan service is cool, IF IT SERVES THE STORY YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL. If it doesn't fit the movie, you've got to let it go. The original worked so well because it was a character moment. It's hammy, campy, over-the-top, and yet it's rooted in genuine rage all at the same time. You need a guy like Shatner, who can be hammy, over-the-top and seem genuine all at the same time, to sell a line like that. Zachary Quinto, for all his particular strengths, is not that guy.<br /><br />So finally, at the end, Spock gets mad and goes after Khan, proceeding to beat him into a pulp. I feel like the filmmakers are creating an unfortunate trend in this new Trek universe where Spock is more or less encouraged to fly off the handle, something that would be considered anathema to the Spock we've come to know and love over 40+ years. At one point, Khan belittles Spock, saying \\"you can't even bring yourself to break bones.\\" So at the end of the picture, what do we see? Spock breaking Khan's bones during their fight, something that is presented as a triumphant moment. I recognize that this is, strictly speaking, not the same character as before, but I feel it's a detriment to the character that, instead of using his two main traits--intelligence and resolve--to win out, Spock just has to \\"hulk out\\" a little now and it's enough to save the day.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and the Klingons were completely wasted. They were in and out of the movie in less than five minutes! The filmmakers could have used any other alien race, could have placed Harrison on any number of alien planets beyond the Neutral Zone, and it would not have mattered. It's a real disappointment that the reintroduction of the most important culture in Trek outside of Earth and Vulcan is so casually tossed off. Truly a letdown.<br /><br />**END SPOILERS**<br /><br />Star Trek Into Darkness has many, many flaws, but it's still entertaining as a popcorn adventure with at least some big ideas. It still isn't terribly original yet, but maybe with a second sequel the filmmakers can finally craft some new ideas instead of remixing old ones. If Abrams and Co. do decide to make a third film, hopefully they will finally embrace some of the headier aspects of Trek (though it isn't likely). The performances are good, Cumberbatch's in particular. Watch and enjoy... but don't think too hard about it.<br /><br />Picture and sound quality were great when I saw them in the theater, as expected. The 3D was very well integrated, especially in the opening scenes, even though the film is just as impressive visually in 2D (we saw it twice). I will update this review with Blu Ray specs when it comes out.<br /><br />**********<br /><br />Star Trek Into Darkness (2013)<br /><br />Starring: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, Zoe Saldana, Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Weller, Bruce Greenwood<br />Directed By: J.J.

B004LWZW9C|4.0|Loved this movie.....laughed and cried and everything in between ! It's fun to watch this movie and the all star cast!! A+++++++
B00BEYYEE4|3.0|Broken City (2013)<br /><br />After all this time, I have to finally admit it: I like Mark Wahlberg. He's grown on me with each new role, even when the movies he's starring in aren't exactly masterpieces. He seems to have embraced the Tom Cruise mode of stardom where, while not stretching too far out of his comfort zone, he manages to play interesting variations on the same persona from movie to movie, and usually delivers an entertaining product. I've always loved Russell Crowe, a great actor who can either be subtle or chomp scenery like a champ (as he does here), and who can make even the lousiest movie he's in (think Man With the Iron Fists) into something at least watchable. It was on the strength of these two that I decided to watch Broken City, even though it didn't get the best reviews when it came out.<br /><br />Wahlberg plays private investigator Billy Taggart, an ex-cop who was booted from the force in disgrace seven years prior for the questionable shooting of an accused rapist and murderer. Crowe plays Nicholas Hostetler, the wheeling and dealing mayor of New York City with whom Taggart has a bit of history. When the Mayor hires Billy during a re-election campaign to find the man with whom his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair, Billy thinks it's a simple adultery case. But as is often the case in movies like these, nothing is what it seems as Taggart uncovers a web of lies involving not only adultery but political intrigue, murder and a shady land deal that may be tied to his own troubled past...<br /><br />The problem with Broken City is that it isn't sure what to focus on. There are just too many running subplots stuffed into this 100-minute flick: one involving Billy's aspiring actress girlfriend (who also happens to be the sister of the victim of the criminal that Billy shot) who is excited about starring in her first indie film, one involving the Police Commissioner who has his own reasons for wanting to investigate the Mayor, one involving Billy's young assistant and the \\"will-they-won't they\\" dynamic they have, one with the Mayor's opponent Jack Valiant (played by Barry Pepper with a freakin' sweet mullet) and his campaign manager (Kyle Chandler), one with the dysfunctional relationship between a powerful land developer and his son, and so on and so on. It's too much. The movie just kind of lurches from plot to plot and as a result, none of them are particulary satisfying.<br /><br />Then there are the little implausibilities which took me right out of the movie. Since there were a bunch of them and I've already written a lot here, I'll stick to three main examples: **SOME SPOILERS AHEAD**<br /><br />-The hilariously abrupt breakup between Taggart and his girlfriend. Basically, the girl does a pretty graphic love scene in her movie and apparently didn't forewarn Billy about its intensity, so his simmering jealousy about the relationship between his girlfriend and her co-star boils over and Billy, a recovering alcoholic, starts getting trashed at the after-party. Then his girlfriend confronts him after watching him have three drinks and says that it's over, and the only thing tying them together is the memory of her dead sister, and blah blah blah. Then she disappears from the film, never to be seen again. This after we've just spent the previous 40 minutes watching them engage in a tender, mutually loving relationship. It felt like the writer was writing the script and thought, \\"Oh well, time to move the story along, she hates him now!\\"<br /><br />-At one point, Billy stakes out the Big Bad Corporation behind the shady land deal and sees a worker take a box of trash to the dumpster. He checks out the box and finds the \\"smoking gun\\": blueprints and projections for the planned real estate development in pristine condition. Not thirty seconds later, he looks in the office window and sees the office workers shredding every document, destroying all evidence of their misdeeds. WTF? Did this one guyjust say, \\"ah, the heck with it, it's my smoke break, no need to shred these\\"?<br /><br />-Evidence of Billy's shooting the rapist emerges in the form of an old videotape taken at the scene. I'm sorry, a videotape?? Even if you take into account that the incident took place seven years before the film, that still only makes the year 2006! I was waiting for the mayor to break out the BetaMax next. (Though I must say, I did like the wrinkle it presented for Wahlberg's character; in the end, he can't take the mayor down without implicating himself.) **END SPOILERS**<br /><br />Reading all that, it seems like I didn't like the movie all that much, but that's not exactly the case. I liked it well enough for what it was: a modestly entertaining, B-level time-waster with some decent acting. It's the kind of film that would have played well on a rainy Sunday afternoon on TNT in the late '90s. In fact, it did remind me strongly of another movie from that era, the somewhat forgotten City Hall (1996) with Al Pacino and John Cusack. Come to think of it, maybe you should watch that instead.<br /><br />Picture quality on the Blu Ray was, as expected for a newer release, very good with lots of deep blacks and no noticeable artifacts. Sound quality was good, particularly during the handful of action scenes. No extras of note aside from the usual fluff.<br /><br />2.5 of 5 stars, rounded up to 3.<br /><br />*********<br /><br />Broken City (2013)<br />Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Geoffrey Wright, Barry Pepper, Kyle Chandler<br />Directed by: Allen Hughes
B004A8ZWVK|2.0|I purchased this used because it said that it was in very good condition, however it had skips in the DVD...I guess you get what you pay for. Disappointed :(
B001ANSSDC|3.0|A different type of story with an interesting main character and nice story plot. Excited to finally watch the movie.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Very easy to understand and follow. Just made it through my second fast day this week. Not bad. In fact, I kind of liked feeling a little hungry. This diet is sustainable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was fantastic . . . just like the movie... couldn't wait until I read the following two books to find out what happened...
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I am reading it for the second time seeing I enjoyed it so much. Its characters are great and there is always a twist and turn in the story. I have read all the other books and the only problem I have had with them is that it is 6 book series and I think 3-4 would have been enough. If you want to get away into the world of fiction then this is the series for you. I hope you enjoy them as much as I have.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I love the CrossFire trilogy but I was so disappointed with this one! I think the story was ok, I feel the book was dragged out to much so there can be more books. I love the first two and wish this one was just as good! I do want to find out what happens to Gideon and Eva because I just love them together and hope they make it through but I don't know how much longer I can wait! I think the ending is what upset me the most and all the unanswered questions! I just hope the next is way better with a great and happy ending! That is if the next don't take to long, I have been waiting over 6 months for this book and was disappointed!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am so disappointed with this book!  I LOVED the first two and was so excited about this one coming out.  All it is is a money maker.  Now I have to wait forever for the next one!<br />Irritated
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I LIKE THIS GAME!  The graphics are awesome  I LIKE the strategy of the game . It is addictive trying to accomplish your distance farther and farther every run.  Different moves you have to pin down. Hi
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I thought that people would throw darts at me for writing a negative review esp. with Ms Day but now I realise I'm not the only one left hanging. I felt the scorching sex but that was about it, even so something was missing. This is more a novella & not a book, leaving you with more questions than those answered. A real teaser! I thought this was where Gideon faced his demons but that wasn't to be. He still has the nightmares & his mum is also an issue. Does it take 2 books to sort his s*** out or more. I don't mind their journey continuing as I love the characters & I would pay to read this but I don't like to be duped.  I was considering seeing Ms Day when she visits Oz in a few weeks but now I'm not sure.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Loved it! Well done retelling of Cinderella without any magic spells or fairy godmother. Drew Barrymore and Anjelica Houston are great in this.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|good app<br />nice simple caculator with basic functions and easy to use. recommended for simple calculations. i use  it for accounting classes
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love playing this game. there are adds sometimes but I still play it every day on my kindle. download this app!!!!!  you'll love it too!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is such a great collection for a great series.  Each season is contained in its own file folder, the box has a magnetic clasp and it comes with a plastic protector to cover the file folders.  Both additional books make it a great set for any West Wing fan.
B0098460O4|5.0|I watch the inspirational story behind these two individuals. Loved their music together and wanted to support them on their musical careers.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book is every bit as terrific as everyone says it is. I admire Strayed's emotional honesty and bravery and highly recommend this book.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I just had to get this movie to complete the set... It is a great movie but very sad at the end..
B0064X7FVE|4.0|For some reason I can't open &#34;The Weather Channel&#34;  anymore on my kindle.  It seems to be loaded but won't open.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app! I got it when it was the free app of the day but I would gladly pay for it. You can use one of the preloaded melodies or tinker around and create your perfect melody. It only took me a half hour to create a melody I can fall asleep to quickly every night. The timer is great since it also lets you tell your kindle to close the app after the allotted time frame has passed, preventing your kindle from losing all it's charge. I absolutely love this app!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Looks good but edges out the limits of the kindles processing abilitys. Graphics and gameplay were a lot like temple run with lasers. Crashed the kindle once.
1452110581|5.0|So sweet, and you just can't put it down.  Each of us has had a cat do all these antics, and its great to see it put into writing so<br />eloquently!
0316044938|5.0|Great book! The book was in such great condition I could barely tell that it was used. I definitely recommend this book and seller.<br />-LL
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love it, I got it as a free app of the day but feel it is worth the few dollars and would not hesitate to buy it.
B000P0J09M|5.0|This freakin movie is so bad ass! I love everybody in this movie! It is the ultimate flick! Plus it came in excellent condition and came really fast!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This man was the greatest man alive at that time. It was very nice to read what his book said he did. He was way ahead of his time,
B0068PHS5Q|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was very descriptive and had a lot of twists in the story. You would think that it would be boring because there were not a lot of characters but this is not the case. Each character had a particularly interesting story. Unexpected ending
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I was very happy.  I got the Movie i ordered really<br />Fast and it came in great condition. Will definitely order again.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Dracula was far more creepy than i would have imagined. Especially in the early parts. Too bad vampires sparkle now.
B00BBA6FOI|4.0|Personal, easy read and loads of situations which women live and have lived through! We need many more women like Sheryl Sandberg who dare to share the experiences, frustrations and aspirations with others! This book is great beginning and the challenge now is to follow up and through, not only by women at her level but all of us who think it is more than timely to get a 50% share of women in leadership positions - worldwide!
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is a fun game to play. What else can I say. Yes, it is a fun game to play.
B0083Z614S|5.0|encourage an understanding of what is kind and truly has value, while experiencing the transformation of a child.  Gives hope to the reader, and encourages an open mind.  Wonderful. Full of heart.<br />&#34;Never thee stop believin' in th' Big Good Thing...&#34; Susan Sowerby
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Lots of choices.  Mostly good, although the heartbeat sounds a little artificial.  Overall a great app.  Developer is responsive as well.  Expect to use this gof a while.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|An amazing album that I can't stop listening to. The media reviews are about spot on -- this is a return to the sound of &#34;Songs for the Deaf&#34; and not much like &#34;Era Vulgaris&#34;. While both are good, I prefer the earlier stuff so this album is a welcome change. Pick this up.
0321525655|3.0|Like most of the business-targeted books I've seen, this<br />spreads a few good ideas thinly across many pages.  Even<br />with lots of redundancy, the book can be read in a couple<br />of hours.<br /><br />I agree with many of Reynolds' points, especially the problem<br />for the audience of trying to read slide text while listening<br />to the speaker, and the need for the presenter to clarify<br />the message \\"off line\\", before working on slides.  But:<br /><br />- much of the advice is targeted towards \\"pitch\\"-type<br />  presentations (it wouldn't do for me to use a slide with<br />  two words on it and a stock photo of a crying child)<br /><br />- the frequent references to Japan and use of Japanese<br />  words was gratuitous and distracting<br /><br />It's ironic that the author decries \\"slideuments\\", but<br />the book itself straddles the line between a traditional<br />book and slideware.<br /><br />If in doubt, get a used copy.
B00190N4E4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Gandhi showed how mountains can be moved through winning hearts, not by fighting.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Civil Rights.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|A typically well told story. I love Le Carre's story telling and writing - I can read and reread his books. His recent books continue to mine a very negative view of the British government and its too close association (if not thralldom) with shadowy money and business sources. Still I would recommend this book in a moment, Any Le Carre book is worth the time to read.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|The music is the reason for the rating.  The humor is ok but much of it is crude and not entertaining to me.
B0072NWJRK|3.0|I am surprised this book won an Edgar.  While the historical facts of the case are fascinating, the author was not able to make it flow as a truly compelling mystery story. It is more history than mystery, but still awfully interesting - especially if you are going to Beijing!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun to play. Easy to catch on to. I like the levels. Quick and easy setting. Get and play it for yourself.
1623360277|1.0|I have NOT read this book.  But if you want to be healthy and lose weight, increasing your starches and eliminating foods that contain healthy fats (including olive oil) is NOT the way to go.  His advice will either cause or exacerbate chronic illness, while spiking blood sugar levels.<br /><br />Don't do it!
030789701X|5.0|It's 1,120 pages, each and every page jam packed with information, photos, and even the latest patch (1.9) information. Legendary difficulty tips and tricks, including every single thing in the game. I've used the past couple of days to read through some of it.<br /><br />The poster of Alduin's wall with the signatures of the Bethesda team is a really nice touch.<br /><br />I've also taken the time to use the digital map on Prima's website and it works great (If you have a laptop you can use while playing. Going to and from a Desktop would be silly.)<br /><br />Only SLIGHT downside: I personally have a stretchable book cover I put on as soon as I opened the guide, because as a owner of the original Collector's Guide (665 pages), the Legendary Edition's spine over time will have a hard time not creasing and that of course is due to the 1,120 pages. So be careful and don't open it all the way and smooth it out like a crinkled dollar bill. That will make it worse. Try to keep the guide as closed as possible while being able to read what you need at the same time, otherwise you will push your luck with the spine which is fighting to hold 1,120 pages.<br /><br />Ribbons help ALOT, and the quality of the pages are on par with the original collector's guide. The map included in the back is like a double sided poster, one side Skyrim, other side Solstheim (DragonBorn DLC). Very Helpful.<br /><br />Also @ $32.49 ($17.50 cheaper than anywhere else) you can't argue with this guide, based purely on financial principle. I bought a Giant Print Study Bible that weighed in at 2,200 pages and it was $100 and has similar spine problems. So don't think for a second this is expensive.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you play Skyrim, you need this guide.<br /><br />Xbox Live Gamertag: Da Don Giovanni
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|The game is alright in itself, but I am pretty disappointed that you have to have an internet connection to play it.  I have a Hughes satellite connection and do not wish to have my Kindle Fire connected to the satellite connection because it eats up a lot of my allowed bandwidth.
B00BNWWUDY|4.0|The movie stars Rooney Mara as Emily, Channing Tatum as Martin, and Jude Law as Dr Banks. Catherine Zeta Jones also has a supporting role as Dr Siebert. The entire cast both main and supporting did absolutely wonderful no questions asked. Rooney Mara was so convincing as Emily that it would be ridiculous to ever call her a bad actress; she nails it in Side Effects. I do not like spoiling movies for those who have not seen it (as many of you already know), so i will simply sum up Side Effects in a series of descriptive words: nail-bitting, thrilling, suspensful,  and very eye opening. Even better, nothing is predictable in the movie; you will have to keep guessing what is going to happen next. It is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen that holds that movie genre. Sure enough, Side Effects is definitely worth watching.<br />Side Effects is just a good movie; one that probably will not win any awards, but is a good movie nonetheless. I am really glad to have this blu ray in my collection. I give Side Effects<br /><br />4 Stars
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|My kids had no idea they were learning algebra basics.  Very well done.<br /><br />I hope to see another from this developer.  There are some basic algebra concepts that get glossed over (e.g. 0*x=0), but I am impressed.<br /><br />Hopefully DB3 is around the corner.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Got here fast for a cool Father's Day gift. It came new, just as the listing stated, wrapped in plastic.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is a continuation from the second book Eva and the sexiest man of exotic romance they will make it  I just hope she does mess it up with Klein. Can't wait for the fourth book. I hope I get to read about them getting pregnant. They continue to get better and better. I love that they are becoming a Foreable union a must read but them in order.
0385349947|4.0|This makes a great gift for anyone. Wife, mother, business woman, sister, best friend -- even husband or male manager. It was very inspiring and easy to read.
