B000NVIXDW|5.0|Fantastic!  Each CD is better than the previous.  I can't wait for his next CD.  I love \\"Lost\\", \\"Everything\\" the best.  Actually love ALL the songs.  Michael is a total class act.  Attended concert recently and he also has a fantastic personality.  Love you Michael!

B000RZGIOA|4.0|After Hard Target and Broken Arrow another american movie with the action movie master director in the director chair.  have a plenty of guns, bullets, winds, doves and slow motion, mix them perfectly, chill for a while and voila you have a great action film only Mr Woo can deliver.    a must see for his fans and wanna be action movie directors :D
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|The first time I listened to Coldplay's new CD, I was a little dissapointed.  It was the first Coldplay CD that I didn't love. However, the more I listened to it, the more I like it.  \\"Viva La Vida\\" fits into my Coldplay collection nicely and like the others gets listened to frequently.  I love every song and have no regrets.  Give \\"Vida\\" a chance if it doesn't grab you right away; soon the music & lyrics should begain to resonate.

B001BKG9SK|4.0|I really liked the DVDs and CDs included in the package.  I liked especially backstage part. Anyway, the song Echoes was the best performed I ever heard, even better that in the previous edition of David Gilmour.  For me it was the last chance to see Rick performing clearly, as a pair-performer, not as a part of support...  I just didn't like when Dave said to the reporter in the interview that he'd not like to play again with Roger Waters (\\"...if he comes, it's time to go...\\")  I recommend this title to fans of Dave and Rick.
0375703764|5.0|I bought this book after reading the xkcd comic ([...]) and was very glad I did. I'm not going into a plot summary, if you want one you can check out wikipedia ([...] Instead, I'm going to briefly discuss the style of the book and address the complaints I've read in other reviews.    I'm not sure how someone can find the plot of The Navidson Record boring. Yes, it's true that there are essentially academic papers scattered throughout the text, sometimes up to a chapter long. First of all I think that these texts, no matter how boring some may find them, are an important part of the story--they are Zampano's writings and add to the depth of his character. And while they are not essential to the text, I found them interesting to read, and it gave me something to think about, some lens with which to view the story once the book returned to the central plot. The author (although I can't remember whether it was Johnny Truant or Zampano, let's just say Danielewski) even comments that you are allowed to skip parts of the text if you so desire. If you don't want to read a 20+ page paper on \\"echo\\", then skip it, or skim through it.    Another comment was that the requisite book-rotating detracted from the experience. I loved all the sections that were like this, and felt they added to the experience. Without giving away the plot, you become disoriented as one of the character does, even forgetting which way to turn the pages as the character struggles to find his way through the house. There is a level of reader-participation required, but if you do pay attention to the intricate formatting it will connect you closer to the characters in the book and how they feel.    Finally, on the subject of the footnotes. Yes, a lot of them are unnecessary, and I could see how it would be distracting to read a multi-page footnote and then try to return to the story. So don't!!! Continue with the text and at the end of the chapter come back to one of Johnny Truant's stories. I don't see why this is so difficult for some people.    In summation this is a great book, and if you put some effort into it you may start to wonder if perhaps the things Johnny Truant undergoes are happening to you. And if you're paying attention, you'll certainly get a kick out of a few of the more clever moments (some of my favorites were pages 168, 192, most of chapter 15, 467).
0060557818|5.0|I work in a used bookstore and read a lot of books of all genres.  Gaiman is tough to categorize.  I have read American Gods and Anansi Boys and toroughly enjoyed them, but Neverwhere blew me away.<br /><br />It you enjoy reading, you will lose yourself in this book.  It has everything you want in a book.  Most importantly, Gaiman knows how to end a book.  It is depressing lately to invest your time in a book that disappoints in the end.  This doesn't.  May be one of the best endings of a book ever.

031606792X|3.0|I have read all 4 books and Breaking Dawn was a little disappointing.  The first \\"book\\" was ok, but I really hated Jacob's \\"book\\".  I honestly did not care what Jacob was thinking.  I think the second \\"book\\" should have been Edward.  We would have known his turmoil between what was best for Bella and what he really wanted (i.e. the baby being gone). We would have known about Rosalie and Bella's agreements about the baby.  We still could have heard Jacob whine about the fact that Bella loved Edward and not him.  These stories are about the love and struggles between Bella and Edward.  Also, if the perspective was Edward's, we also would have heard what Leah shouted at Bella.  \\"Book\\" Three was also a little bit disappointing.  The way that Bella just took to vampire life with little or no struggle.  The whole battle with the Volturi was the most disappointing though.  All that build up and nothing.  Edward and Bella were never put in any real danger.  There was no big fight to keep there love and family alive.  How could they really appreciate everything if there was no scarifice on anyone's part?  There should have been someone to scarifice themselves for Nessie.  A better twist would have been for Rosalie to give up her life to protect Nessie.  Edward and Bella should have struggled a little more to perserve their love and their family.

B001DHXT1G|3.0|WARNING SPOILERS WARNING<br /><br />I'll agree that Ang Lee's 'HULK' (2003) was a poor attempt but I was not inspired by this movie at all.  Going up against 2 of the greatest comic book movies in the same year (Iron Man & The Dark Knight) doesn't help 'The Incredible Hulk' but the #1 problem with this movie is how few chances this movie takes.  None of the casting choices are great (although none are poor), and the script is so blah it's the kind of movie that you want to just sit down, veg and not think too much about.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie we get a quick rundown of how Bruce Banner became the Hulk, we see he's on the run and General Ross is going after him.  Ross is commissioned Emil Blonsky (who later becomes the Abomination) who help lead the team to get the Hulk and there is a weak love story with Banner and Ross' daughter Betty Ross (played by Liv Tyler).  Possibly worse than the script is the pitifully weak acting by said Tyler.  In the comics Betty was always a stronger character but here she is the mega damsel in distress.  She is supposed to be a Phd. but she's very wimpy and the acting leaves a lot to be desired.  Norton is acceptable but he's 10 years since his amazing 'American History X' role and he's subdued but nothing special.<br /><br />The thing that is special is the CGI which is fantastic.  The last 15 minutes of the movie is a CGI tour de force and it's amazing how computer work gets better every 6 months or so.  Much more believable than the 2003 Hulk movie this is a grand accomplishment.<br /><br />If you want a popcorn movie that is just something to watch and you can leave your brain on the shelf this is nice.  If you are looking for a comic movie to compete with the classics like Iron Man, The Dark Knight, Superman, Spider-Man 2 you will be disappointed.<br /><br />*** 1/2 RECOMMENDED
B001CDLAT4|5.0|Much has been said in the past 16 years of the film itself, so I review the specifics of this version. The newest (and likely final) DVD edition comes from the transfer intended primarily for the Blu-Ray release.  By all means, if you possess a Blu-Ray player, get that disc. (I suggest you look to the numerous videophile magazines slowly putting out reviews on that format).<br /><br />The boasted 8K UltraDigital HD transfer provides enough information for down-scaling to DVD specs without too significant loss, though the area of greatest benefit from the transfer is the color saturation.  The special features are contained on the second disc, allowing room on Disc 1 for the movie's generous bit-rate and the DTS 96/24 5.1 audio track.  The high bitrate for the video allows for great detail contrast with surprisingly little visual noise, preventing any jarring artifacting in the scenes of high detail in movement (compare the distant shots of large flocks of birds in this DVD versus similar shots in the DVD version of Planet Earth, and the difference is clear).<br /><br />The surround mix itself is perfectly immersive, and the music could have been done no better justice than to have the new mix restored and overseen by score composer Michael Stearns.<br /><br />Regarding the special features, I'll first touch on the lesser bonus documentary for the restoration and scanning process. It starts out feeling like an industry advertisement for overscanning with an 8K machine.  Soon, they demonstrate and justify the necessity, artistically, for all this \\"technological back-slapping\\".  And at six and a half minutes, doesn't overdo it.<br /><br />The main documentary, \\"A Closer Look\\", is much more satisfying and steadily interesting.  At an hour and sixteen minutes, this covers the full scope of the entire history, from Fricke's early work with Reggio, to the development of the technology for creating this film, to the many experiences in filming and traveling.  It ends with a few points on the scoring, and a brief discussion of the film's reception and impact.  This documentary benefits strongly from the extensive amount of behind-the-scenes video, as it provides a firm visual anchor for the numerous anecdotes the crew has to tell, and frequently offers touching moments between the filmmakers and the peoples with whom they interacted.<br /><br />Overall, this DVD is a great piece that shows the strength remaining in the capabilities of DVD in spite of the growth of Blu-Ray.  For the videophiles with an HD monitor not yet buying into the Blu-Ray market, consider this a cornerstone of your \\"show-of\\" set, yet buy it also for the film's stunning beauty.a brief discussion of the film's reception and impact.

B001GAPC1K|5.0|WARNING SPOILERS WARNING<br /><br />On the surface the script for Iron Man is simple and basic.  We find out the origin of Iron Man, how he builds the suit and a major villain arrives with a similar suit to challenge him.  Iron Man saves the day etc. rinse repeat.<br /><br />What makes this 'comic book' movie great and one of the best adaptations of all time is 1 thing.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr.<br /><br />I had been a comic book fan since I was a kid, and while I mainly collected Spider-Man, I knew Iron Man and his back story.  I knew him but never really was into him except when the story revolved around Tony Stark and his personal life.  While usually the book is better than the movie, this is one of those rare exceptions where the real life version far exceeds the book.<br /><br />Quite simply, like Heath Ledger as The Joker, you don't see Downey Jr. on the screen but Tony Stark.<br /><br />Yes, he's that good.<br /><br />Whoever casted Downey for this movie deserves a raise or % of the profits because without him the movie doesn't excel.  Yes the CGI is fantastic but the other people cast in the movie don't inspire the audience.  Paltrow is fine, Howard I thought was good (bad move replacing a decent character who wanted to return for the sequel with Don Cheadle as good as he is), Bridges is very good but this movie belongs to Downey Jr.<br /><br />Sometimes a basic script can be made exceptional when you find a definitive actor to play a role.  Not only will this film make comic book fans happy, it is perfect for both genders, all ages, or anyone that likes movies in general.<br /><br />One of the greatest comic book movies of all time and a joy to watch that instantly ranks in the top 5 of said adaptations ever made.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|If you are wondering whether it's worth the 18 bucks and change for the blu-ray, in my opinion you shouldn't wonder any longer. Pick this disc up. The movie, which is near-flawless in every way, just gets better in 1080p. You can really appreciate the passion that director Curtis Hanson brought to the film when you pick up the incredible detail in every filmed location. A great surprise was Jack Vincenne's (Kevin Spacey) monogrammed \\"JV\\" on his shirts --- never noticed that before when watching in standard def. It's these little details that really envelop the viewer in the world of corrupt, violent 1950s L.A.    The special features on the BD seem to be a port over from the special edition DVD put out a few years ago, but they're still great. This is obviously Curtis Hanson's pet project, and he poured a lot of effort into the home video release.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Very nice series.  Photography was breathtaking.  I didn't like the way it jumped all over the place.  That was a little confusing.  There are some raw spots.  Nature is \\"Nature\\",  I understand that.  You may want to view it before the kiddies see it.  There are some brutal scenes of animal killings, but not enough to turn you off to the wonder of it all.  All in all, we totally enjoyed the series and would recommend it.  We truly live on one heck of an amazing planet.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay is in the running for most improved and inventive band of the year, crafting not only their best album, but the best of 2008 thus far. The band expands on their new \\"cultured\\" sound, and gone are the melodic experiences that were \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Speed of Sound,\\" and welcome to the string-based epic of \\"Viva La Vida,\\" the culture rock of \\"Violet Hill,\\" and the melodic lushness of \\"Lost.\\" Is the new sound better? While most would say no, I think the album grows on you. And in the end it's nice to have a fine work of art worthy of Da Vinci, rather than the pumpkin carvings of Top 40 Radio. Ironically, \\"Viva La Vida\\" was the band's first #1 on the Billboard Hot 100<br /><br />With the guiding hand of musician and producer Brian Eno, the production values on this album are top notch, as showcased in the instrumental \\"Life In Technicolor,\\" and the inspiring \\"Lovers In Japan.\\" This album simply begs to be listened to in full surround sound. Because for all the experimentation the band does on the album, they want you to have an experience. The band chiefly tinkers with transitions, with songs like \\"42\\" starting out to be a haunting ballad, before turning into an upbeat rock song, then back again. This strategy mostly works, giving a fuller body to songs. Another oddity the band has grasped onto is the \\"hidden track,\\" which they use three times, to mostly mixed results.<br /><br />When deciding whether or not to buy the album, I walked into the Sharper Image Store where they were playing \\"Violet Hill\\" on one of their surround sound systems. It's then when it hit me: This album is too darn good to pass up. Although I would've liked to have bought the deluxe edition featuring their upcoming EP or add-on to the album, it's the band's most solid and consistent record yet, bringing a cultured sound to the band. This album is both enchanting and entrancing. It's surprising and never disappointing. Make no mistake about it, to not buy this album or give it a Grammy would be a musical crime. A true work of art in the sea of tranquility.e. A true work of art in the sea of tranquility.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|There are not enough superlatives to describe this television show!

B001EOOQEM|5.0|The remastering, to my ears, sounds very close to the 1998 Castle (and 2004 Sanctuary) import version. It sounds really good, but to me, it's not light years above the Castle/Sanctuary remastering job from 1998. If you have the Castle versions, I don't know if I would invest in the new remasters. They sound a lot alike, to my ears. Now I love Sabbath, and I'm not dissing on Rhino. It's just that the remastering sounds similar to the 98 remastering job. I've heard Live Evil and it is nice to have the whole 2-LP set on Rhnio's version now.  It's odd that some people claim that Bill Ward's drums were \\"buried\\" on the previous CD versions of \\"Heaven and Hell.\\" They sure weren't on the Castle/Sanctuary remasters, and they aren't here. Ward's drums thump. I am so glad Ward played drums on this album, as he is my favorite Sabbath drummer. Appice is good, but Ward is the top Sab skin-hitter.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I bought this 25th Anniversary Edition HP-12C for my economics papers at Uni. Has been one of the best purchases I have made and I could only recommend this whole heartily to anyone in the field.

It does leads me to wonder why Reverse Polish Notation calculators are not more widely used by the public at large. Regardless, this is one device worth holding onto.
B000001ESN|4.0|After spending several years conjuring up alien landscapes, doomed space travelers, and Greek gods, Rush got back to earth on this one. Nowhere is this more evident than on on \\"Spirit of the Radio,\\" which was inspired by listening to rock radio in Toronto. There are tons of good riffs here (even a short reggae-inspired break) and in 1977 or 1978 Rush might have used them to create an extended composition about the battle between an old Norse god and a dwarf. In 1980 they used them to construct a complex, but still concise, catchy rock song warning of corporate rock and arguing for honesty...HONESTY!...in music. It is definitely Rush's calling card (and still sounds vital) even 28 years later.     \\"Free Will\\" is the other obvious classic here. It has a catchy chorus, fairly preachy lyrics about how each of us is the master of his or her own destiny, and a middle section solo that kicks some serious butt. What more could you ask for from Rush?    Aside from the classics, you have two progressive pieces, both of which are among Rush's more successful. \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is probably a couple of minutes too long, but otherwise it is a fine listen. \\"Natural Science,\\" is also great. I especially like the middle part which has an almost new wave feel to it. Loads of fun.    The other two tracks, \\"Entre Nous\\" and \\"Different Strings,\\" are pretty good songs which only pale in comparison to the other tracks on the album. They are still better than most of the album tracks on their earlier records.    All-in-all this is an excellent record, that falls just slightly short of five stars. Let's call it 4.5! If you want to get into classic Rush, this (or Moving Pictures) is as a good a place as any to start. Then start moving forward and back.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|\\"The Bank Job\\", directed by Roger Donaldson<br /><br />London, 1971; Terry Leather (Jason Statham) is a small time crook running a car lot and struggling to keep up with payments owed to a local loan shark. Terry needs something to push him over the thresh hold so he can secure the financial future of his wife and kids. Apparently timing is everything as an old acquaintance of his, Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) approaches him with an offer. It turns out that she has somehow managed to get some inside information on a bank. The alarm has been on the fritz and will be deactivated over a weekend allowing them the ability to enter a vault full of safe deposit boxes the contents of which will not likely be reported by the owners. Unbeknownst to Terry, the British government has a vested interest in the contents of one of the boxes which they can't access themselves as do some of the more powerful criminal elements of London. Terry quickly finds out that robbing the bank is only the beginning as the contents owners are not as quick to let go of their belongings as was originally thought...<br /><br />\\"The Bank Job\\" was a pleasant surprise and a smart move for lead character Jason Statham. He breaks his Kung-Fu, Transporter type cast with this role although he is reprising his \\"Transporter\\" role. \\"The Bank job\\" is loosely based on an actual bank robbery that took place in London but much of the story presented in the movie is conjecture and artful speculation as is stated in the special features and likely common knowledge for any who were around for the event or have studied it at all.

B000001ESP|5.0|On this record Rush solidified its status as one of arena rock's biggest and best bands. What I like most about this album is that it's loaded with hooks, but it doesn't actually become a pop album. And there still aren't any traditional pop songs on here. (Well, maybe \\"Vital Signs\\" comes close.) I am sure that you don't need to read again that \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight\\" are great tracks (they are). There are so many other highlights here:    >Just sit and listen to Neil Peart banging away on \\"Red Barchetta.\\" Not to take anything away from his band mates, but he owns the track. It's one of those 6-minute songs that feel more like a 3-minute song.  >\\"YYZ\\" is arguably Rush's best instrumental (it's right up there with \\"La Villa Strangiata\\" and \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" in my book). I especially love the middle eastern section in the middle. It's a little cheesy, yet still works.  >\\"The Camera Eye\\" to me is slightly reminiscent of \\"Hemispheres,\\" but is a little more succinct and catchier. I used to think this was kind of boring, but I have recently started to dig it.  >\\"Vital Signs\\" provides a pretty good glimpse of what Rush would sound like on the next couple of albums (and continues to show the influence that new wave was having on their sound).  >\\"Witch Hunt\\" has just the right level of foreboding. Again, it helps point the way toward SIGNALS and GRACE UNDER PRESSURE.    It all adds up to the best album Rush put out during their heyday. I'm still pretty partial to SNAKES AND ARROWS, but this is the record I would tell anyone to buy first, if they wanted to give Rush a try.
B00005JPO1|2.0|This got two stars only becaues it is Indy, one of the all time greatest heroes.  But damnation those CGI monkeys and that entire scene completely ruined the entire movie! WHY would he use such cheesy special effects and such a cheesy child like scene! IT RUINED THE MOVIE!
B001DSNEJM|3.0|\\"The Lazarus Project\\" aka \\"The Heaven Project\\" is one of those straight-to-DVD releases, which was okay i guess, though after viewing it, I felt this was a lot better than some other actual cinematic releases that were pure drivel.<br /><br />Paul Walker [of The Fast and the Furious] plays Ben Garvey, an ex-con who is just getting his life back on track with a beautiful, supportive wife [Piper Perabo] and young daughter. But his past catches up with him and his no-gooder brother comes back into his life with a solution - robbery - well, things go terribly awry resulting in fatalities, and Ben is left to shoulder the guilt and blame. He is sentenced to die by lethal injection and that is when the movie actually begins.<br /><br />Ben finds himself getting a sort of 'reprieve' from death and is whisked away to an psychiatric facility somewhere out in the boondocks and is given the job of groundskeeper - the people that he comes into contact are all either strange or sinister or both - the priest Ezra [Bob Gunton]who runs the facility, Robbie [Malcolm Goodwin] a mentally challenged patient, William [Tony Curran] a violent inmate, psychiatrist Julie [Linda Cardellini] who warms up to Ben very quickly, and a stranger [Lambert Wilson] who pops up at the most inopportune times to warn Ben that something's afoot.<br /><br />The movie takes its time to unfold, but what carries this movie through is not just the storytelling, with its unique premise, but Paul Walker's performance - I know, he's not exactly known for his acting chops, but he does a pretty decent job here of lending credibility to his character. I actually came to care about what happened to Ben in this movie. All in all, this was a decent thriller with a good premise.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|As a fan of historical costume drama/romance, I thought I'd seen everything! However, quite by chance I found this DVD, North and South, and was blown away. It has become one of my all-time favorites.  The original story, written by Elizabeth Gaskell, has a lot to recommend it. I learned something about the culture of the times, the prejudices that existed and the friction that developed as the result of the industrial revolution. All of this is the backdrop for a riveting human story about love, loss and forgiveness. All the actors are very good and the production values are excellent. The romantic tension between the leads is palpable and Richard Armitage does the brooding, repressed thing like nobody's business! Absolutely a must see.

And it took me only eight hours to read it straight through! I think it's the first time that's ever happened. What's also surprising to me is the subject matter. I'm not really fascinated with Greek Mythology. Slavic, yes, but Greek, no. So I was a bit puzzled that I was unable to put the book down. Maybe it was Rick Riordan's clever way of giving the myths more modern personalities and appearances. Whatever the reason, I just couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />Percy Jackson both a hero and an anti-hero. His ADHD and dyslexia are what makes him interesting, and I could almost picture what the boy really looks like. His two friends, Grover and Annabeth, aren't your ordinary sidekicks. Both have had haunted pasts, and they would do anything to make sure that Percy is never hurt nor killed.<br /><br />Other characters (especially the Greek ones) are worthy of recognition. Aries is a tough one: he's like Bruce Campbell with a sword instead of a chainsaw. Hades will sure scare little kids, but what makes him compelling is that he isn't your ordinary villain: he's got a heart alright. Dionysus sure can be annoying at times, but you know that he's trying to do some good at least. Medusa is one hell of a woman: she can sound innocent while thinking evil thoughts.<br /><br />The plot twists throughout the novel work and sometimes they don't. I figured out who Percy really was when it cam e to his special powers on a specific element. But the biggest plot twists that are found in the last seventy pages or so are the most unexpected.<br /><br />The pacing is wild. It goes from New York City to the north side of New York State to St. Louis to Denver and finally to Santa Monica so quickly. And it's a mystery in how you can get so much information about Greek Mythology in that sort of wild flow.<br /><br />Some parts do tend to drag a bit. The sequences in Camp Half Blood almost bored me, but the pace picked up when something goes wrong in the area.<br /><br />So, in short, this is one of the greatest children's books of our time. And it's for all ages, not just kids.<br /><br />A-ound in the last seventy pages or so are the most unexpected.    The pacing is wild.

All the way thru I kept on expecting french or saunders to pop in.  each show is an episode in its own right, but there is also an overlaying plot.  Judy Dench of course is the main character, and the young town doctor is very dreamy indead..

B00192KCQ0|4.0|I have to admit that after first hearing the album I walked around saying \\"Wow, this doesn't suck!\\" Talk about a surprise! I'm glad I didn't write Metallica off completely after the musical abortion that is St. Anger (or Load/Reload etc.) because this one is pretty good. The guitar solos are back, the thrash roots are showing, and the drums don't sound like tin cans being shot with a B.B. gun. Death Magnetic is not Metallica's best album by any stretch, but it hopefully indicates that the valley has been crossed and they're moving up towards the next peak.
B00006EXL5|5.0|My Chemical Romance's quality and originality has decreased steadily since this CD.  Those goth-looking and alternative rockers are not what My Chemical Romance started out as.  In this CD every song is unique, each with their own touch in both music and lyrics.  The whole album carries you in an avalanche from begining to end, and somehow the slower songs have as much energy from every source as the harder, louder ones.  Gerard's voice is just amazing.  Completely original and full of uncontained, raw energy, unlike, I regret to say, the later CDs.  The lyrics are just damn amazing, to the careless eye open and somewhat violent, but under that shallow layer (which seems to be what My Chemical Romance stuck with for The Black Parade) lies a world of coils and metaphors.  Now I'll do a review of each song, because they're all so unique that I can't capture the whole album in a panoramic view.  Romance: A short, musical introduction which sets the stage for the next song.  Beautiful and romantic, in a My Chemical Romance sort of way.  Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough for the Two of Us:  Yeah, I love that title!  The song is more breathtaking than a fall flat on your back and just as impacting.  The lyrics are simply superb in that MCR \\"open\\" style with all those twisty little metaphors inside of it.  The singing and music are amazing also, leaving me to wonder why they changed.  This is MUSIC the way I've never heard it before.  Vampires Will Never Hurt You: At first I thought it was a roll and tumble downhill after Track 2.  The melody didn't seem to follow a set pattern and it seemed as though the words didn't really fit.  Then I realized they were all points in favor for the song.  It makes it diferent and unique, and the fact that they pulled off this dangerous variation only proves them better.  Gerard doesn't shy away from a good scream, and they carry the song not only on but up.  I cried with this song.  Drowning Lessons: Half a step down from the previoussongs.  While the lyrics are just as good the melody is a little on the hysterically happy side.  I can tell that they did it on purpose and I admire them for trying this variation but they fell a little short.  Our Lady of Sorrows: Oh man.  The energy of this song is just unmatched.  The only thing I have against it is that it's too short (a mere 2:05 minutes).  It's what I call \\"Wham!\\"  Just about left me on the ground (again).  Headfirst for Hallows: Another of the Drowning Lessons type.  Here they did better though, with more apt lyrics for the mood.  Skylines and Turnstiles: *Snif* One of the saddest songs ever written.  It had me crying by the fourth line.  From what I've heard, it's the first song Gerard wrote (album-quality, of course).  It's about the fall of the Twin Towers.  It just brought me back to the moment it all happened and all the pain and sorrow and USELESSNESS of it all.  I've honestly rarely cried like I did lying in the dark listening to Skylines and Turnstiles.  Early Sunsets Over Monroeville: This song, while being much slower than the others, and down-tuned musically, is the pinnacle of Gerard's singing.  The sweet, romantic start fades into a desperate cry of mysery and pain.  I cried through the whole thing.  There's something about the way Gerard chokes out \\"But does anyone notice? But does anyone care?\\" \\"And there's no room in this hell, there's no room in the next\\" and overall \\"And in saying you loved me made things harder at best\\" that just reveals the part in you that cries not only its eyes but its heart and soul out.  This Is the Best Day Ever: Another short one.  Precariously balanced, I think, on slightly different lyric style, catchy guitars and singing and the strategy of racing through the song, it did quite well.  Cubicles: Although not my favorite song, the proud owner of the best line ever written: \\"I'd photocopy all the things that we could be if you took the time to notice me\\". And I'd plaster that phrase all over my room if I could.  Just wonderfully ironic and metaphoric and smooth all in one.  Demolition Lovers: what can I say.  If I had to pick my favorite out of the whole CD it would be this one.  Another crying song, by the way.  Not so sad this time, just so incredibly beautiful.  \\"I'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets.//I'm trying, I'm trying, to let you know just how much you mean to me.//As snow falls on desert skies, until the end of everything.\\"  Everyone displays their talents without plain showing off (as they did in the ending track for Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge).  It starts out slow and then builds up to a eardrums-blasting grand finalle, both for the CD and for the last \\"real\\" My Chemical Romance we will probably ever hear.
B00188M5TM|5.0|Clint Eastwood's \\"Changeling\\" is not easy to watch, but I implore you to give it a try. This is filmmaking at its finest. It's all at once heartbreaking, infuriating, touching, empowering, and immensely compelling, which is to say that it taps into core human emotions without being manipulative. It tells a story so absorbing, it's as if the movie is happening to us instead of just passing before our eyes. This is appropriate given the fact that it's a true story and not merely based on a true story; screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski relied on actual articles, transcripts, and testimonies to document the story of Los Angeles native Christine Collins, whose nine-year-old son, Walter, disappeared in March of 1928. Five months later, the LAPD returned a boy Collins knew was not her son. Because the police refused to admit that a mistake was made, they deemed Collins an unfit mother and subsequently had her committed to a mental institution. But she wouldn't be silenced, and with the help of some key figures, she took on one of the most shameful cases of police corruption in Los Angeles history.    Angelina Jolie gives yet another wonderful performance as Collins, an honest, caring woman who was clearly striving for independence in a male-dominated society. She works diligently as the supervisor for a telephone company, so much so that she's offered a managerial position. As a single mother, she's firm yet nurturing, and she's upfront with her son (Gattlin Griffith) about why his father left before he was born. After Walter's disappearance, and after the wrong boy is returned to her, she initially faces the LAPD on her own, which leaves her with little since it's a tyrannical system motivated by power, not justice. There's a pivotal scene in which Chief of Police James E. Davis (Colm Feore) makes the following announcement: \\"We will hold trial on gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows theleast bit of mercy on a criminal.\\" This is immediately followed by a shot of officers executing a line of criminals in the middle of a dark street. An elimination of the competition. For a system this dishonest, a persistent woman like Collins is seen as nothing but a disruption.    Of all the authority figures in this film, Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) is by far the most deplorable. He's obstinate and domineering, bullying Collins into taking in an imposter child, who was found with a drifter in DeKalb, Illinois. Jones has the nerve to question Collins as a mother, claiming she was so happy her son was taken that she's now resorting to phony accusations. Her insistence that he carry on the investigation lands her in a dehumanizing psychiatric hospital, where numerous disruptive women are sent to endure constant medicating and cruel electroshock therapy. A kindly but broken prostitute (Amy Ryan) tells Collins that there's absolutely no winning with the doctors. If you smile too much, you're delusional. If you smile too little, you're depressed. If you're neutral, then you've lost touch with basic human emotions. All anyone can do is learn how to behave properly.    The only person on Collins' side is Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), a Presbyterian minister and community activist who made it his life's work to expose the corruption of the LAPD during radio sermons. When Collins is committed, Briegleb takes it upon himself to publicize the disappearance of her son and rally the public to support her. This puts tremendous pressure on the LAPD, as does the recent discovery of a crime scene; buried beneath a chicken ranch in Wineville, California are human remains. A mechanic named Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) becomes the primary suspect in a string of murders. I don't want to reveal any more about this case, but I will make it a point to praise Harner for not playing Northcott as a fanatical stereotype.    Apparently, Straczynski inserted newspaper clippings into copies of his screenplay, just as a reminder to the actors that everything being depicted actually happened. \\"The story is just so bizarre,\\" he said, \\"that you need something to remind you that I'm not making this stuff up.\\" Indeed, a lot of what Collins goes through is so outrageous that it's just shy of being funny. She knows, for example, how tall Walter is, for she measured his rate of growth on a wall. The boy who was returned to her is three inches shorter than the last notch. Collins also notices that this boy has been circumcised; she knows for a fact that Walter has not been. A doctor sent by Captain Jones assures Collins that, after months of improper care and nutrition, children can actually shrink. As for the circumcision, well, she should never put it past a kidnapper to do something extreme.    But what about the LAPD? Should she put it past them to do something extreme, such as returning the wrong child and knowing about it? It's easy to watch this movie and feel just as emotionally drained as Collins; there are moments where I wanted to scream, others where I wanted to cry, and many where I didn't know how to feel. This is not a criticism. The success of a movie like \\"Changeling\\" depends on a strong emotional gamut that reflects what the audience thinks and feels. This is, without a doubt, one of the year's best films, a powerful human drama dedicated to the ideals of hope and perseverance.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|This trilogy on Blu-Ray left me with the opinion that the first chapter was the best but I was looking forward to seeing Robert De Niro in the second and I was impressed with his portrayal of the younger Marlon Brando in his role as Vito Corleone. Now I understand why these guys get paid so much. He even sounded like Marlon Brando let alone take on his mannerisms that he (Brando) had adopted for the part. Al Pacino did a sterling job as the linch-pin in all three movies and held the trilogy together in continuity terms at the very least but essentially gave the whole story some meaning in his role as the reluctant but necessary member of the \\"Famiglia\\" that tried to go legitimate.  As for this Restoration Edition the work that the studio did to clean up the thirty-five year old picture was nothing short of incredible. The transfer is so clean and precise that at times some of the outdoor scenes took on a three dimensional image and I don't think I have ever seen so many different shades of BLACK in a movie before. Overall this is a very dark movie (and I don't just mean its theme) and the Blu-Ray just brought it all out into sharp focus as I'm sure F.F.Coppola was aiming for in this beautiful restoration. Well Done all involved and a treasure to own. My votes were; Chapter 1, 9/10 EXCELLENT. Chapter 2, 8/10 OUTSTANDING. And Chapter 3, 7/10 DISTINCTIVE.
0143038419|5.0|I really have enjoyed this book, although I started it after the KITE RUNNER (which was the best book I have read in years) and didn't think it would even compare. Well it doesn't compare because it would be \\"apples to oranges\\" but each book in its own right is FANTASTIC! I am now in the last 1/4 of this book (finally) and have to say that I got curious about the author's other books and her personal life outside of what was revealed in this book so I checked out her website here and read the FAQ which were fascinating and well worth the read.[[ASIN:0143038419 Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia]]
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Very well put together. Hans Zimmer is a GENIUS! This soundtrack from start to finish takes you on an adventure that you could sense even if your eyes were closed while you listened to it. Each track sets its own mood and was very appropriately placed in the movie itself. I'd recommend this to anybody.
031606792X|4.0|This was the best book of the series. It was compelling and interesting. A real page turner. I finished this book over 2 intense days. The twists were unexpected and the happy ending satisfying. Certainly not classic literature but a good read nonetheless. I would recommend this book for a riveting read. Enjoyable for romance and suspense lovers.

B00104JONO|5.0|I am in my 30's and am a total musical fan via Grease etc. I got in to these with my kids and was instantly hooked!! We have waited for months for HSM3 to come out and today we went to see it. From the opening shot at the basketball game to the graduation scene at the end I was thrilled!! The songs are awesome, if a little cheesy (but not every song in Grease was awesome either) and the dances are very well done. My favorites are the Boys are Back in the junkyard with Troy and Chad, and Scream with Troy at the school (the angst of which reminded me of Footloose). The characters have matured and their acting skills are top notch in this film. There were moments where the film drug just a tad but overall it was an awesome movie. I wish they had fleshed out the Zeke/Sharpay relationship in this, he didnt even ask her to prom!! I really wasnt in to any of the new characters tho I know they are a necessity for HSM4 but I could have done with less of them. I will watch HSM4 to see how it fares without Troy and Gabriella, but doubt that it will be an instant classic as this one is. I cannot wait to have it come out on video so I can buy it to watch it over and over (um, with my daughter, yeah thats it) and memorize the songs. This was a definite great movie to see.

B001FBSMW6|5.0|I love Keane's previous albums and this one is just as brilliant to me. I think much of the album is about the struggle for finding and maintaining love, which will hit a chord with most mature people. The standout tracks for me are Spiralling and Again and Again. These are highly energized and powerful while still having bittersweet lyrics about failing love. I find Again and Again to be highly cathartic--an emotional release. The other tracks on the album seem to fit in with previous work with their ambiance and lush vocals. Several tracks are more quirky and even humorous such as Pretend that You're Alone or Better Than This. These I enjoy very much too and give balance to the album overall. Overall this album is a huge success, but possibly not for you if you want something without tinges of darkness to it. I find it not so different as many reviewers have said it is a big departure from previous work. For me it still Keane and still absolutely great.
B001AX9DT0|1.0|I was eagerly looking forward to a new album from Ray as I considered Till The Sun Turns Black to be the best album I bought in 2006.    Unfortunately Gossip In The Grain falls a long way short for me. Ray's voice is still there but the material is only average, the arrangements totally lack a spark and the recording quality is considerably inferior. While I haven't had an opportunity to test it I suspect that the dynamic range has been compressed which detracts from my listening pleasure a lot.    Not an album I would recommend.
B000002JS6|2.0|Although this is the first full-length with Brian Johnson on vocals, the band had already seemingly reached their musical peak during the Bon Scott era.  The 8 releases that followed this album are almost identical in substance, and weigh heavily on the release of the title track from each respective album to keep fans interested.  The previous 6 studio releases with Bon contained at least some variation as the tracks progressed through the album.  It seemed like producer extraordinaire, Mutt Lange, mastered the tracks for this album to sound polished and radio-ready during the recording process.  You can hear similar over-production on titles such as \\"Hysteria\\" and \\"Come on Over.\\"  Stick with the earlier AC/DC releases for true gritty rock n' roll.
B0009EW0O6|5.0|Fred C. Dobbs, as portrayed by Humphrey Bogart in THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, is a man who undergoes a rapid and malignant metamorphosis.

His later bouts of agitated paranoia eventually fester into an act of full-blown psychotic violence; Dobbs suffers a kind of cosmic justice after this incident.<br /><br />In contrast to Bogart's totally despicable Dobbs is the delightful Walter Huston, whose portrayal of Howard, an old-time miner hoping to at long-last strike paydirt, got him a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor statue for 1949.

It's a rousing adventure with the new Bond in a post cold war thriller involving a faceless arms dealer, a stolen french helicopter and a secret satellite system called \\"Goldeneye\\". Pierce Brosnan is great as Bond, Sean Bean his usual top-notch performance as Janus with Isabella Scorupcca (?) and the incredible Famke Jansen (5'11\\", 38-24-36) as Xenia Onnatopp.

B000LY5QQS|5.0|In his second outing as 007, Brosnan takes on a media mogul out to ignite a war simply for ratings.  Gadgets courtesy of \\"Q\\" include a fully loaded BMW and a \\"shocking\\" cell phone.  Jonathan Pryce, very  effective on news magnet Elliot Carver, Michelle Yeoh as Chinese agent Wey Ling and the ever forgetable what's her name from DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES.  Interesting side note: the KD Lang tune at the end was actually supposed to be the title song (It has a real GOLDINGER feel to it) but the studio wanted a bigger name and had a new title song done with Sheryl Crow.  Thematically, the Crow song has no ties to the rest of the soundtrack. Also, the movie was supposed to be titled TOMORROW NEVER LIES but some dim-witt at MGM-UA got confused.
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|From the writer of Academy Award winning director Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" comes a modern retelling of \\"Oliver Twist,\\" mixed with \\"Amadeus.\\" This is an excellent family movie (aside from some mild language, thematic elements and brief violence). Freddie Highmore (\\"Finding Neverland,\\" \\"Charlie And The Chocolate Factory\\") does a very good American accent and can cry on cue. Keri Russell (\\"Waitress\\") and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers are terrific. Robin Williams is menacing, but not quite a villain. Unfortunately, the movie ended too abruptly, hence the four out of five stars. Should've had a clear resolution. Other than that, I loved this movie. Rated PG for thematic elements, mild language and brief violence.
B00005ABIP|5.0|Having been a long time Cake listener on the West Coast and also having seen them numerous times in concert, I believe that 'Prolonging The Magic' is quite probably their best effort.<br /><br />'You Turn The Screws' is up there to the top of my favourite songs by Cake. This album delivers from  the first moment to the very last without a seconds hesitation.<br /><br />Cake is infectious and highly listenable, they also don't seem to have a quality that fades or makes them sound like a flash in the pan or dated as many other bands do. It's hard to produce good music that stands the test of time and that also sounds incredible in concert.<br /><br />I've been to hundreds of shows over the years in probably just as many genres, but seeing Cake preform in a very small club in Hollywood for roughly 50 people, has to be best show I've ever seen, bar none. No, I didn't get to see Bowie during the Heathen tour going through the Five Burroughs, either. That show was probably the best show ever done for modern man, and the buzz on it was tremendous - but alas, I missed it.<br /><br />So, back to Cake ...<br /><br />Where are they now?<br /><br />Still touring ... at least for now. I would suggest getting out there and seeing them while you still can. They always play the hits and the large crowds always seem to know all the lyrics. John McCrea has stated that he's probably nearing the end of his run as a performance musician and wants to 'return to the earth ... and farm'.<br /><br />Cake and their reception ...<br /><br />Unfortunately, John McCrea seems to have taken a lot of the criticism the band received over the years and internalized it deeply. Maybe too deep. I'm not speculating here either, as it's been much talked about amongst Cake fans and in the media. I guess it's hard not to though when some of the mainstream reviewers were pretty harsh and very dismissive.<br /><br />The good thing about Cake though, is that history will remember them well and hold them a coveted spot in the small group of musicians that had a strong and lasting impact on the modern music scene without completely selling out or imploding all over themselves.<br /><br />... ...ing impact on the modern music scene without completely selling out or imploding all over themselves.    ... ...
B000VAPZM2|4.0|This movie was good. Although I must admit, like many sequels, it was not as good as the first. More things are unrealistic in this second movie. However it is still a sweet, fun, clean, entertaining movie. For best results, you really need to watch the first one first!
B00006690G|5.0|\\"Things done changed ...\\" -- Notorious B.I.G.<br /><br />Some folks might be wondering what's going on with Marshall/Slim at the moment. His absence on the music scene, despite how you might feel about him, is noticeable. His music is singular, even in such a prolific field as Rap is and even with as many people that are on his CD, whether as a performer, a producer or a mixer. Historically, the people that have walked in his shoes never faired very well, whether it was through continued success or respect amongst fans or becoming a sell-out. I don't think Slim has to worry about the last one at all as he's struggled continuously to stay relevant and fresh.<br /><br />The Eminem show may not be the fan favourite, and it may even have a few low moments that fans would rather do without, but this album is like a snapshot of the artists life in full-color, or stereo. It's a very complex and sometimes moving memoir on his life in song. A lot of other recording artists would be so lucky to have been able to achieve something this powerful so early in their career. In fact, unfortunately, most musicians never do. Good 'concept albums' are few and far between.<br /><br />The story of a young man trying to get up out of the hood, is one that's familiar with a lot of people. The struggle is real and that's probably why his music has resonated with so many folks from all corners of the world.<br /><br />Rap music may have gone through an epiphanous phase during the mid nineties through to ot-five. Slim coming in during the beginning and making it all the way through to the end without plastic surgery, heavy jail time or an over-dose. He may have made it through some dark times in order to tell us about it all years from now.<br /><br />This is an album that absolutely must be listened to as it encapsulates the last decade very well.<br /><br />... ...
B001CC7PP8|5.0|After his 1958 masterpiece \\"Vertigo\\" and the chase thriller \\"North By Northwest\\", director Alfred Hitchcock wanted to see if he could make an inexpensive Black and White movie that would scare the pants off of the audience. Apparently at this time period, low-budget, but poorly done, scary movies were doing quite well at the box office. Hitchcock wanted to make a low-budget scarefest that was well done. He apparently found the plot of \\"Psycho\\" (based on a pulp novel by Robert Bloch; and inspired by the gruesome exploits of serial killer Ed Gein; who subsequently also \\"inspired\\" the original \\"Texas Chainsaw Masacre\\" and \\"The Silence Of The Lambs\\") quite humorous. Paramount Studios, however, wanted nothing to do with it. So, Hitchcock paid for \\"Psycho\\" out of his own pocket, and used the film crew from his TV series \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents.\\" Although initially perceived by disgruntled critics as an ultimate sick joke, \\"Psycho\\" succeeded in scaring the pants off of the audience beyond Hitchcock's wildest dreams; by entering into our nightmares.<br />  Watching \\"Psycho\\" again after all these years, I have to say it holds up extremely well. It is still a profoundly disturbing and unsettling film. It holds up because Hitchcock cleverly and continually deceives the audience; always keeping  us off balance just when we might be feeling momentarily safe. Bernard Herrmann's music score helps tremendously. Saul Bass' title credits are cracked in half; instantly foreshadowing the fractured psyche of Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and also perhaps the psyche of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Thus, the audience is thrown off balance before the film's plot has even begun.<br />  We begin by thinking the plot is going to be about Marion, who steals $40,000 from her boss to help solve her disasterous love affair with Sam Loomis (John Gavin). That is Hitchcock's biggest \\"red herring\\", but he throws in a few others as well. After driving through a rainstorm, Marion experiences the original \\"motel hell\\" when she winds up at the Bates motel and meets manager Norman Bates.<br />  In Bloch's novel, Norman is forty-something, fat, balding, alcoholic and unsympathetic. Another masterstroke of Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano is transforming Norman into the image of actor Anthony Perkins, then age 27. Anthony Perkins gives an amazingly subtle performance. Norman is a loner. He's shy, but attractive. He stammers and smiles; all his boyish charms hiding deeper levels of secrets and deception, of course. He tells Marion, \\"We're all in our private traps. Clamped in them, and none of us  can ever get out.\\"  Clearly, Perkins was deeply invested in the character of Norman (and later, unfairly trapped by him). One can only guess at how well Perkins understood about \\"Private Traps.\\" Marion has overheard Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, being very cruel to him. But he defends her: \\"It's not as if she were a maniac-- a raving thing. She just goes a little mad some times. Haven't you?\\" Norman is trapped by his mother on several levels, and Marion is soon a victim of the Norman/Mother trap. In the \\"Making Of\\" Documentary, Joseph Stefano reveals he was in Freudian therapy for his own \\"Mother Issues\\" while writing the \\"Psycho\\" script; and that puts yet another spin on the film's many twists and turns.<br />  Marion is brutally murdered in the shower;  in what is probably still the most terrifying 45 second sequence in cinema history. This infamous, brilliantly edited, sequence is also another example of Hitchcock throwing the audience off balance. Marion has been our sympathetic protagonist; and we have seen things through her point of view. When she is murdered approximately 49 minutes into the film, her \\"point of view\\" ends. The \\"point of view\\" now shifts to Norman, and he becomes the \\"protagonist\\", as a dogged detective (Martin Balsam), Sam and Lila, Marion's spunky and spirited sister, (Vera Miles) all eventually arrive at the Bates Motel--and it all works brillantly. At the end, when the secrets of Norman and Mother are revealed, a psychiatrist  (Simon Oakland) explains it all rather glibly. But Hitchcock felt the psychiatrist's speech was necessary in getting the entire film past the strict censors.<br />  \\"Psycho\\" is and always will be very much a \\"Hitchcock picture.\\" But, in addition, the film ultimately belongs to Anthony Perkins. We are terribly sad and disturbed by Marion's horrid murder, but we also feel sorry for Norman. That may be the slickest of \\"Psycho's\\" bag of tricks, but it is also a tremendous tribute to Anthony Perkins' riviting performance. \\"Psycho\\" has often been imitated (Anthony Perkins returned for the much later \\"Psycho II\\", \\"Psycho III\\" (Perkins directed), and the intriquing \\"Psycho IV: The Beginning), but it will most definitely never be surpassed.<br />  DVD EXTRAS: A fun Featurette shows how Hitchcock \\"sold\\" \\"Psycho\\" to audiences, and how he kept its \\"secrets.\\" \\"The Making Of Psycho\\": Wonderful feature-length Documentary includes interviews with Janet Leigh, Joseph Stefano, etc. Documentary: \\"In The Shadows Of Hitchcock: Hitchcock's Legacy\\", (25 minutes), and an episode of \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\\" titled \\"Lamb To The Slaughter\\" with Barbara Bel Geddes (from \\"Vertigo\\") and much more.At the end, when the secrets of Norman and Mother are revealed, a psychiatrist  (Simon Oakland) explains it all rather glibly.

B0011KQSZ4|1.0|I borrowed from my library as I do many movies.  I tried to watch it but I, too, did not find any amusement and I checked the display and had already watched 37 minutes of it without the hint of a laugh.  Does this movie start out REALLY slow because it just wasn't funny to me at all.  I consider myself to have a pretty good sense of humor and I laugh easily at funny, witty lines.  The bit with the guy who was under the influence of some drug was to me, something only young immature boys would find amusing.  I found myself watching this like it was an assignment that I had to complete and I finally just stopped the DVD and gave up.     Not my \\"cup of tea\\", I guess.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Well, I'm just another fan of the films, but the real deal is in the extra features. Very food ones. The transfer in the films could be better, I guess.
B000ZLFALS|4.0|I bought this for my husband as a companion gift for his new HD LCD TV. He loves the Beatles & was intrigued by the use of their music in this show. He uses it to show off the TV's attributes... \\"Look at that color!\\", \\"Hear that sound!\\", \\"What a show!\\". I'm sure we will be seeing it over & over!
B001EN71DG|5.0|Here's why.  Look at the above space where it says the percentage of people that ultimately buy the product.  As I write this the number is 61%.  That is why he does it.  It's all about the benjamins baby!!
0385340990|5.0|I purchased this book for myself, my mother, and my aunt..this because our family roots go back to Guernsey Island. I thought it would be of historical interest at the time.<br />What a surprise to find an amazing array of wonderful people, all conveyed through letters back and forth.<br />It was truly difficult to realize that this is a work of fiction. Everyone seems so real.<br />And this historical pieces of the novel, capturing post war England and Guernsey were also quite vivid.<br />I recommend this to anyone who likes to pick up a book that you just can't put down... although I must warn, it was disappointing to have it end!<br />Mr Gale Davis<br />Zephyr Cove NV
B00014NE62|5.0|The movie follows the book.  It is a great movie. I have looked at it  many times, so I could get the full meaning. It is a must see if you are  a writer.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|i enjoy te new cd still not as heavy as i would like metallica to get back too. but its better then the last few cds
1401307787|5.0|This is a classic. Any day that I spend time with this book - usually just one entry at a time - greater peacefulness and focus are assured. And often the author's insights turn my views upside down - there's much to discover here.
B000002JSP|5.0|The only thing missing from this great re-issue of 1979's \\"In Through The Out Door\\" (L. Zep.) is: the brown grocery-store style paper bag cover that the original LP had.  Their last group recording together is still great, here in the \\"future\\" (relatively speaking, that is, from 1979's point-of-view)!
0307387178|4.0|Book is good, the movie is even better.  The book does not have personality like the movie does.   You did not feel for the main character, unlike the movie that made me cry in the end.  Although the book is interesting, there are additional outdoorsmen stories.
031606792X|5.0|I love the book Breaking Dawn it was a nice close to a increditable book series.  I hope that people understand that it is FICTION and its to be enjoyed as such.  I love her writing style. Its an easy read. I hope that Stephanie Meyer can find it in her heart to make spin off books on Bella's daughter and her life.  I love the books all four a must read.  I would recommend that you be 14 and up to read these books.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This is a terrific spectator movie.  A must see for all ages.  My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this film.. No more needs to be said.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|To begin with, I think the fellow that wrote the official Amazon review for this album would probably have to click the NO bottom at the top of this \\"Create Your Review\\" page to the question of Are you over 13? On the contrary, this effort is MUCH more mature and developed than the fist pumping hard rock that Mr Amazon must love. The songs exhibit better song writing, and although the verse can be a little heavy, it gets your attention. Of course an album about herioin addiction SHOULD have heavy lyrics don't you think?. I would advise anyone who is a little tired of the same ole-same ole to pick this one up and give a listen.
B0000256KE|5.0|I find that this is one of there best albums great cover and great music.
0767020308|5.0|This Emma is the best production.  The others don't compare with this one.  Kate Beckinsdale is very good as the lead character and the production is much more realistic than the others out there.  Emma is a difficult book to produce it is a bit thin and shallow.  This is the first show I've seen that has made Emma as realistic as possible.  It really works!  I found myself engaged in the story and feeling for the characters.  It works.
B000V69900|5.0|Another John Mayall collection of great artists its the blues only the way John Mayall could produce it  a great sound from musicians who went much  further in the music industry.
B001AW9DKK|3.0|I don't get it. Some people are surprised that this disc is anti-war and anti-Bush? Gee, who would have thought that? This has always been their stand since they formed years ago. If you don't agree with their politics or stance on Bush or the war, don't listen to or buy the CD. All part of the freedom of choice.      That said, the music here is just OK. The 4 part harmonies of the past are completely gone now. Neil still sounds like Neil, but the other 3 can't harmonize anymore. Too bad. Also, some of Young's lyrics range from trite to just plain dumb. A few more songs from their vast catalog and less of the anti-war songs would really have livened this disc up.I'll just listen to my old Cd's of them and remember when.
B000VWJP5I|5.0|This is a great album the violin makes such a big difference to the line up I am so glad someone like John Mayall was around to produce some great combinations of musicians and music. I have this because it is  great and I feel if you are into John Mayalls music this is a cd you should have.
B00007BKVC|5.0|It is impossible to defend everything Thelma and Louise did as events unraveled.  Never mind illegalities; some of their misdeeds were deliberate and just plain wrong.<br /><br />However, I consistently wanted them to make it.  If Louise was not going to turn her back on Thelma, then neither was I.  Louise was the brains behind the outfit.  Thelma was naive and less-than-intelligent, and she cost Louise dearly many times.  No one could have blamed Louise for letting Thelma go in hopes that she (Lousie) could still make it.<br /><br />Louise's love and friendship for Thelma turned out to be more fierce than her instinct for survival.  Who wouldn't want to be on their team?<br /><br />Another compelling thing about this film is the go-for-broke mentality.  As their situations deteriorate, they start pushing boundaries and limits in ways that most of us never will.  It becomes impossible to look away.<br /><br />If you have only ever watched this on cable, you should rent this film at least once to see the missing scene between the stranded desert cop and the Rastafarian.  It offers comic relief in a tale laced with desperation.  By the way, the cop was played by the actor that portrayed Demi Moore's boyfriend in GI Jane.<br /><br />Michael Madsen (Virginia's brother) would have been tempting for a lot of us girls.  Hats off to Louise for realizing that to a large extent he was only pursuing her because he could feel her slipping away.<br /><br />I am still hoping that somehow, some way Thelma and Louise made it.  In film all things are possible.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|Just received the Complete Set SATC.  Some disks showed fine scratches but so far, random checking results in good playing quality.    Question:  I received two Season Six, Disc 3's.  Disk numbers are both 93042.  They contain the same content. Dis this happen to anybody else?  Is there any list of what each disk is labeled or its content?  I notice those numbers aren't sequential for the set.  I wonder which one I'm missing?   Will notify Amazon. Thanks.
B000P12LWY|5.0|LOVE IT!  Can't wait for the next series.  Our whole family has watched the whole season twice, we own it, love it love it love it!  Acting is fantastic, Jonathan who plays Henry VIII is not only an amazing actor, he BECOMES Henry.... he is a master, and a gorgeous one at that.  The costumes, the music, the stage sets, all so believable, really brings the Tudor story to life.  Best Henry VIII saga ever!  Thank you.... been waiting for this for my whole-life..... pre-ordered the next season already, and am counting the days!  Best TV series by FAR.
B001EN71DG|1.0|I was a college student when Star Wars was first released. So I was part of the phenomenon that grew up around the film and its sequels, and feel almost obligated to comment.    I saw the original at least a dozen times on campus - after all, it was tailor made for us college kids.... figure it out.    Over time I believed that when these hit dvd, they would be instant treasures, but no, we had to go thriugh the re-release, and re-edited versions, and then, when we finally got them, the \\"true\\" versions were non-anamorphic.    Maybe there is a newer generation that doesn't care, but like others out there, I really think Mr. Lucas dropped the ball on this one. The topic has been discussed ad infinitum all over the net, and he, no doubt is aware of the outcry regarding the original trilogy. We are not going to change his mind. I do hope he does reconsider though, as there will be huge profit to be made should he put the originals out anamorphically.... If its money he wants - this will fill his pockets....    As to this set - well - if you don't have them... Otherwise, I hate to disrespect Mr. Lucas, but I have to agree - why bother. I'm a huge fan, but without the originals in anamorphic, I'm done with Star Wars.
B001AEF6D6|1.0|I saw this movie on tv, with all the language cut out, and thought it was very funny.   Bought the movie from amazon.   Was totally disgusted.  The 'F' word was the most used word in the movie, practically every sentence.   No reason for it, it didn't add a thing.  I soon found myself disgusted and making unflattering comments in response to the characters lines.  Gave it away.  Should have burned it as the trash it is.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I LOVED this movie! I confess I love all of Miss Austen's books and love to see any adaptation.  I don't care if things are put in or left out so much, because I like to see the adaptation style.  I thought the leads were wonderfully cast, I could look at the captain all day:)  The only part of the entire movie I didn't like was (spoiler) after Anne ran back to her home to find the captain, when they finally go to kiss, she had this thick, ropy saliva that was strung out between her lips and teeth and was just so yuck and obvious to me that I couldn't help thinking that he was \\"acting\\" here.  But then again, I am in the dental field, so I perhaps noticed that a lot more than some.  But otherwise, I loved the cinematography, lovedddd her wacky sisters (Mary was an amazing actress and just a joy to giggle at) and the captain, just wow.  The music was incredile, I would be the first in line to buy this soundtrack.  My sister borrowed this DVD from me, and is in Australia right now with it, and I cannot WAIT to get it back!! Happy Austen trails to you all.
B0012GVKW8|5.0|Oh man, what an American classic. This is my favorite movie of all time !!!    I am so happy they decided to redo this masterpiece. Blue ray makes it even better. Awesome LOVE it !!!!!!.
0375826726|5.0|Great story,could not put it down once I started reading-can't wait till the next one,just wish there was not so much time in between books-hard to wait!!

All of the actors are new to me,but everyone is superb.I'm so glad its been renewed for a new season.If you are bored over the winter,True Blood will warm you up.  (The last show was FANTASTIC,the killer was  a shock,and Jason is so funny at the end.Bill proved his love for Sookie,but is in for a big suprise when he is waiting for Sookie to come over.The new shows start next summer.I can't wait.}
0736063684|5.0|This is an excellent written book on the muscles and their purpose also when to work out what groups together to enrich your body. Highly recomended for the new and the advanced person either getting ripped or just toning and staying in shape.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|CD was in great shape, shipping was fast. Was happy with what I paid for the CD. Will do it again. Thanks.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|Great Movie! Saw it twice in theatres, had to bring it home! You laugh and then you are pushed to tears! Really plays of the tv show and no gaps took place.  Well directed!
B001E75QGG|4.0|This movie isn't isn't great, but it isn't horrible either. It still had some Indy feel to it and held my attention throughout.     I think the problem is the first three movies in the series (except for Temple, maybe) have built such a legendary status because of just how good they were and how good they were in comparison to other movies in the 80's. Add 20 years or so and some nostalgia to the equation and those movies have become bigger than life. Expectations from everyone who watched this movie are so inflated that it would've taken a masterpiece to leave the theater or your television feeling great about it.     Be sure to take it off of its pedestal and just watch it as another decent adventure movie. It's better that way.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This blu-ray is all a blu-ray should be. Amazing sound and awesome picture quality topped off by great price. Amazon is practically the only place I buy blu-ray mivies now.
B001G5IJVK|5.0|As you can tell by the title of my review, this <kompilation!!> is equivalent to the KISS Solo albums, Greatest Hits-styled, for each of the original KISS members. I, too, abhor all the dozens of versions of \\"Greatest Hits...\\", but really couldn't resist buying this one. It is the ONLY \\"hits\\" package I have bought since \\"YOU WANTED THE BEST...\\" during the band's reunion formation, not counting the NEW RECORDING BEST from Japan. (That is an incredible disc, by the way!)    I really have no major complaints about the track listing since I have all of the original vinyls and CDs, and can burn an \\"extended\\" version of these discs as I choose. My only change to this would have been to ixnay \\"Christine Sixteen.\\" I HATE THAT SONG, and THEY INSIST ON CRAMMING IT DOWN OUR THROATS. (In this day and age, it reeks of illegal relations between adult and minor.....gross and immoral, but that's another story). Not only do they choose to keep this song around, they keep mis-crediting it to ROCK AND ROLL OVER (Paul credits it to ROCK AND ROLL OVER in just about every live recording I've heard), and Gene notoriously starts the song half-way through...and THAT'S when he even gets the lyrics RIGHT! Gene? Mr. KISS-Perfectionist/Ace and Peter were losers who couldn't keep up? Christine needs to be comitted to an asylum and forgotten about. (Now she'll probably get credited to ASYLUM on that note.)    As for adding songs, I AGREE WHOLE-HEARTEDLY with the many reviews about \\"Torpedo Girl\\" needing to be on here. I'm one of those fans who has a sentimental bond to the UNMASKED album simply because that was a fun album to swim to in 1980. That album was released in June 1980, and we finally got to break in a new swimming pool; how cool it was to \\"go out and take a swim today.\\"     Another song I would have added: SHANDI. Why do they treat her like some whore at a family reunion and ignore her? I wish \\"Shandi\\" would tie \\"Christine\\" up and lock her in a closet.    This collection of songs, in my opinion, goes to show how much talent Ace had with the band (as he still does) and I find his disc the one that I have already listened to about 4 times all the way through. Ace and Paul maintained the KISS sound and attitude. These discs can't help but scream that out. To that end, only Ace had songs from UNMASKED represented here. I guess we will have to salivate over the Australian pressing in order to get \\"Shandi.\\" No wait! We can burn our home-made versions for FREE with it.    I like Peter's disc a lot and am glad to see \\"I Can't Stop The Rain\\" on here. I was in New York last week and all I could say was \\"this is New York! Yo~!\\" and flying back home to Texas at night, there was lightning in the sky as I played this track over and over. It truly cemented a great trip with a great conclusion: complete with real lightning across the sky. The piano in \\"I Can't...\\" is very haunting. I think I finally realized that when listening to it this time around. We can thank Sean Delany for that great gem of a song. (I personally could do without the g-d word in it; I don't like that word let alone in a great song).    Gene's disc starts off ironically enough with \\"God Of Thunder,\\" and for an opening to a disc...with the kids screaming, it's pretty cool.    It does come with a 24 page booklet with some rarely if never before seen photos, and is done up first class, as in all things KISS.     In conclusion, I just hope to show that this box set is really a \\"KISS SOLOS 2K: 30 Years Later.\\" When you view the discs as \\"Greatest Hits\\" by the \\"IKONS\\", then it becomes much more enjoyable and understood. If you take the solo albums and swap the names of the members with \\"SPACEMAN,\\" \\"CATMAN,\\" \\"DEMON,\\" and \\"STARCHILD,\\" then you can much more easily see my analogy.  While on topic of the solos, it wouldn't be quite the KISS product without the infamous solo album covers being represented: when you open the gatefold, each disc is placed in a pocket that has the corresponding members'solo cover. (I love the solo covers, but they are way over-used now.)    All in all, to those that wish to buy this collection, remember this: it is a second chance to buy KISS SOLO albums, 30 years later (1978-2008), and when you load the discs and let them go, it really does take you back in time to a good place: rock and roll-slash-fantasy-slash-fun.    This is a great collection to have. If you get ANNNNNNNNY of the G.H. packages, burn your money on this. It is a COLLECTORS' package, not a romper room novelty.    I've been a KISS fan non-stop for 31 years. This collection should have been released a long time ago, in this format.    Enjoy! Randy <kissfox>
B0006OBPTA|4.0|This collection is definitely a must for fellow Karate Kid fans. It is the best collection out there at the moment. It's pretty satisfying but here's what i like to share (i won't discuss the films as everyone knows part 1 is the best, 2 is pretty good and 3 is a joke while 4 is a bonus):  Part 1 has the most bonuses, the best being the commentary from the cast and the featurette with new interviews which is interesting to watch, seeing they've all aged and still remember the project. It's not an awfully long feature but it's worth watching. Other than a couple of lame trailers, that's about it. Part 2 has a very short feature and trailers as well. Part 3 and 4 aren't even worth mentioning to be frank. The picture quality of part 2 isn't very good and at times the color is a bit disappointing.  One more thing, the packaging and the design of the collection is not very rewarding. I'm not talking about the cover on the front of the collection but the individual covers on the discs. See part 2 and you'll get it. The carton packaging is not very sturdy and could easily be torn.  But overall. the films are still fun to watch. It's a lot whole cheesier than it used to be, but at the price they're charging it's certainly worth a buy.     Btw, Pat Morita is a great actor. RIP Mr. Miyagi.
B000VXKWU4|4.0|long before disco and saturday nite fever, this album along with children of the world were the best beegees  sounds out . good harmonies.
B000BT97AO|3.0|So, basically, this is a special effects piece through and through. And a rather bizarre one at that (my first impression was \\"Wizard of Oz on LSD\\"). The imagery is strange, ethereal, slightly jarring at times and occasionally a bit dark (though never frighteningly so).<br /><br />The movie is, in large part (aside from the beginning and end), a dream-world. And, much as dreams often don't make sense, neither does this world when it comes right down to it. As such the plot seems a bit contrived at times with semi-random events happening and semi-random resolutions to situations.<br /><br />While the visuals are sometimes cool and the movie is relatively inventive, somehow the movie still didn't do much for me. I can't really put my finger on it. I guess it was the somewhat jarring and unsettled feeling / mood of the movie that was offputting.<br /><br />The special features are fairly interesting, with some \\"making-of\\" material, etc.
B00104JONO|1.0|I'm an adult who saw Grease and Xanadu first run and enjoyed both of them.  I liked HSM 1.  HSM 2 was less enjoyable (too rehash-y) but okay.  This was drivel.    Bad acting.  Rehashment. Pointless plot points.    Things I did like:  1) Darbus was more of a real person than a caricature.    2) Kelsie took off that hat.  3) Great choreo  4) Corbin Bleu can act and sing and dance  5) Tisdale can act  6) Lucas can dance very well  7) In fact, so can Efron - but he still looks like an alien to me.  Ken doll come to life. He landed on earth, and like Ford Prefect decided that Zac Efron was a good name to pick.    Things I didn't like:  1) Gab's annoying giggle . Way overplayed.  2) The photo of the half naked sophomore. That was really a dubious thing to encourage kids to do to each other (and yeah, I know they already do).  And in light of Ms. Hudgen's previous faux pas, a little odd.  3) The sophomores in general.  I realize it was an attempt to set us up for HSM 4, but it was blatant.  The 'rocket' kid actually was funny at the end.    4) The \\"Mr Moose ping pong ball\\" moment with Troy.   5) Troy's dad's horrible toupee  6) Gab calling Troy wildcat ALL THE TIME. Maverick anybody?  7) Gab's choice near the end of the movie was selfish and thoughtless. Nobody ever called her on that.    8) Kelsie still cannot sing  9) For some reason Taylor and Kelsie REALLY annoy  me with their gestures and facial expressions.  10) And when the pop and lock girl did that stupid gesture/move/catch phrase when Bolton (was he class president or something?) was addressing the graduating class, I was yelling at her inside my head to sit down and stop making a spectacle of herself.    11) The 2 sharpays. Weird and very much single-white-femalish psycho.  Kind of like that battle between bad superman and Clark in Superman III... another disappointing seque
B001F7MSG6|5.0|Warning! Spoilers abound!<br /><br />Gradually over the past several years Guillermo del Toro has emerged as arguably the finest creator of fantastical films in the world. Now that he has been tagged to direct the two-part HOBBIT he has the opportunity to cement that reputation. Even without that, however, he has a string of remarkable films behind him. His finest film remains PAN'S LABYRINTH. He has also made both of the HELLBOY films, the stunning Spanish language THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, the second (and best) part of the BLADE trilogy, and the absolutely terrifying horror film MIMIC. Others can boast two or three such films, but few so many or of such high quality.<br /><br />HELLBOY II was, if anything, even more enjoyable than the first film. del Toro focuses less on plot than on the interrelations between the various characters and the way that affects things. Their superheroic adventures by contrast serve as mere interruptions to that.

Over the years Jones, a mime by training, has carved out a career as perhaps the best-known physical actor in Hollywood. If you need a character that needs to move in remarkable fashion, Jones is often called upon to bring them to life. For instance, though Laurence Fishburne voiced the Silver Surfer, Jones provided the template for the CGI imaging. Fans of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER will remember him as the taller of the two main Gentlemen in the classic Season Four episode \\"Hush.\\" But no one has used Jones as effectively as del Toro. He has been not only played Abe Sapien in the Hellboy movies, but several other characters as well. And in PAN'S LABYRINTH Jones portrayed both the Fawn of the title (which is not, by the way, Pan -- that was added only to the English translation of the title -- in most other languages the film is simply THE LABYRINTH OF THE FAWN) as well as the Pale Man who haunts the girl with his eye balls in the palms of his hands. I'm sure del Toro will find a place for him in THE HOBBIT as well. Actually, I'm fairly certain he'll find several places.<br /><br />There were just so many things that I enjoyed about this film. Many of these were small touches, such as the battle Hellboy has beside the Brooklyn Bridge with the Elemental, while holding a small baby. As a viewer knowing what he does not (that Liz is pregnant with his child), one realizes that he might make a better father than one might initially suppose.

B001F7MSFW|5.0|Warning! Spoilers abound!<br /><br />Gradually over the past several years Guillermo del Toro has emerged as arguably the finest creator of fantastical films in the world. Now that he has been tagged to direct the two-part HOBBIT he has the opportunity to cement that reputation. Even without that, however, he has a string of remarkable films behind him. His finest film remains PAN'S LABYRINTH. He has also made both of the HELLBOY films, the stunning Spanish language THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, the second (and best) part of the BLADE trilogy, and the absolutely terrifying horror film MIMIC. Others can boast two or three such films, but few so many or of such high quality.<br /><br />HELLBOY II was, if anything, even more enjoyable than the first film. del Toro focuses less on plot than on the interrelations between the various characters and the way that affects things. Their superheroic adventures by contrast serve as mere interruptions to that. The central conflict in the film is Liz's unhappiness in her relationship with Hellboy and her hesitation in telling her that she is pregnant.

0743290119|1.0|When I saw that 14 public library patrons were ahead of me on the internet waitlist for this book, I imagined that was a good sign and that I'd be in for a real treat and a perfect vacation read. NOT!  After waiting for almost 2 months for this \\"novel\\" to become available, then resisting the urge to start reading until I left on my week-long trip, I felt completely duped and cheated once I got a few pages into this book. Awful disjointed writing, transparent characters, and no plot to speak of made this book TORTURE to get through. I'm glad I took some Faulkner and Follett along with me.  What a waste.
0143038583|5.0|Let me put it out front -- I'm an omnivore and nothing in the book changes that.  What has changed is my entire way of looking at food.  The book is loaded with information that makes one reconsider the mix of foods you eat.  What I like is that it does this while not telling the reader precisely what foods to eat and what foods to avoid.  Rather, the emphasis is on balance and on knowing something about where your food comes from.  This is a subject for which too many authors become preachy, but not Pollan.
B001ISZYKY|5.0|Wow what a fun and satisfying debut album by these two great acts! This is real genuine classic rock music with a great selection of song styles - rock, blues, ballads, pop, new wave, even some that's a little country-tinged. Brian May and Roger Taylor bring their trademark Queen sound to the proceedings with distinctive guitar work and percussion, and Paul Rodgers has one of the greatest voices ever. They haven't lost their touch! This album beats anything in the Bad Company catalogue and is as good or better than any album Queen released in the 1980s. A true meeting of equals, the band's histories blend together to make anew and very distinctive sound of its own. Open your ears, clear out your preconceptions, and get ready to enjoy some *real* music by *real* musicians!

B000JVT1U0|5.0|The Wicker Man is easily one of my favorite horror/thriller films of all time. There really is nothing else like it. It is truly one of the most original, atmospheric, and creepy films of all time.<br /><br />After a detective is sent to investigate a murder on a small island, what seems to be a normal investigation turns into a surreal nightmare. The more digging he does, the more he is subjected to the strange beliefs and views of the Pagan lifestyle.<br />The pagan imagery, beliefs and rituals are very accurate, as the maker of the film spent much time studying and understanding the Pagan views.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this film is it's score. There is a lot of music in it and it actually borders on being a musical, which in my opinion is not usually a good thing, but it works so well in this film setting the mood and understanding the Pagan culture I wouldn't have it any other way.<br /><br />But the thing I really love about this film is the message, and how it pokes at the inaccuracies of the Christian faith. The final scene with the Christian detective praying for his life and his prayers going unanswered is extremely powerful.<br /><br />Overall I cannot recommend this film enough and any horror/film buff owes it to themselves to check this out.<br /><br />Note: Stay away from the remake!
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|Instead of releasing the 3D movie as it was in the theaters with the grey lens process, the studio remastered it to include the red & blue lens 3D technology.  I was so irate at this that I returned my copy as soon as it was opened.  I felt like I was kicked in the gut.  I enjoyed the 3D in the theater and to be treated to a substandard 3D experience was insulting.  Only buy this if you are interested in the 2D film.
0061649708|5.0|Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman -- and it doesn't matter if it's a kid's book.<br /><br />And \\"Coraline\\" -- now being released as a movie -- is no exception to Gaiman's track record. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous \\"other\\" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (not \\"Caroline\\" is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a formerly bricked-up door that leads into an apartment in another world, which looks eerily like her own. In fact, it's so similar that she has a taloned, button-eyed \\"other mother\\" and matching \\"other father,\\" as well as a chorus of singing, dancing rats and magical toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are very attentive. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Without Neil Gaiman's touch, \\"Coraline\\" would just be another story about a kid who learns to appreciate her parents. But he infuses this story with a dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children in a mirror, beetles, disembodied hands, monsters that cling to the wall with souls in their grip, and rats that sing about how \\"we were here before you rose, we will be here when you fall.\\"<br /><br />That dark, cobwebby atmosphere clings to the increasingly nightmarish plot, as Coraline navigates a world where the other mother has every advantage. And Gaiman's wordcraft is exquisitely horrible -- the other mother's hands are compared to spiders, her hair to undersea tentacles. And the fate of the other father is a magnificently ghastly thing.<br /><br />He even infuses poetry into the horror (\\"A husk you'll be, a wisp you'll be, and a thing no more than a dream on waking, or a memory of something forgotten\\"), and a fair amount of macabre humour (\\"I swear it on my own mother's grave.\\" \\"Does she have a grave?\\" \\"Oh yes. I put her in there myself. And when I found her trying to crawl out, I put her back\\").<br /><br />Coraline herself is a wonderful little heroine -- strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint. And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless -- who \\"wants something to love. Something that isn't her. She might want something to eat as well.\\"<br /><br />Neil Gaiman creates eerie, slightly warped worlds like nobody else, and he does an exquisitely horrible job in \\"Coraline.\\" Just never go through the door.her mother's hands are compared to spiders, her hair to undersea tentacles.

B001F12J48|1.0|For those of us that fell in love with \\"The Polar Express\\" when it came out in 3D in theaters, this is the biggest slap in the face that Warner's could sell us.  I have been anticipating this home 3D version since it was announced and snatched it up only to have my excitement crushed when I discovered that the 3D was done with the old fashioned \\"red/blue\\" glasses and not the grey lenses currently in theaters.  Why would they do this?  First off, the dual color lenses ruins the color saturation of any film.  Second, the technology is out there!  With Blue Ray, HDTVs, DLP projectors and such, the replication of a true home multiplex is in our grasp.  The film has already been processed to use the grey lenses.  Why spend the money to reprocess the film into red and blue separation?  This makes no sense.  When I discovered this deception, I immediately opened the packages at the counter and promptly returned them.  (The same applies to \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\".  It has the colored lenses too.)  Do not waste your money on a sub-standard 3D experience.  UPDATE:  While I understand another reviewer's tale of the polarized light 3D, I don't believe that the \\"Disney Digital 3D\\" that I saw \\"Monster House\\" or the theaters that showed \\"Beowulf\\" or \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" bought special projectors just to feature these films.  My original IMAX experience used \\"shutter\\" type goggles that looked like diving gear and I could see that point.  But my last few experiences, from \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" through \\"Meet the Robinsons\\", have been \\"Blues Brothers\\" type glasses that I was able to keep.  My belief is that the technology is out there and someone at the head office just thought this was cheaper to produce.

B000NJVWUA|4.0|After purchasing this installment in the excellent Alan Parsons Project reissue programme, I realised quite how much I'd under-rated this album when it first appeared back in 1984. The seventh Project outing was markedly different from its predecessors but, whilst I still don't think it's the Project's best album, it's an enjoyable listen and has some real high-points. Please note that four stars is a judgement relative to other APP albums - considered more broadly, all APP albums are emphatically five-star material. No one has done this sort of thing better.     The first five APP albums were innovative, leading-edge progressive rock. 'Eye in the Sky' was slightly more commercial, and this trend continued with 'Ammonia Avenue', which moved more into the pop/rock mainstream. The Project was evolving from progressive rock into a pop/rock band - and, in my opinion, did this better than anyone else.     An immediately noticeable feature of 'Ammonia Avenue' was that the nine tracks included a string of catchy, rocky cuts, any one of which could have been a hit single. 'Prime Time' was perhaps the most commercial-sounding APP track to date (which is in no way a criticism - I love it). 'Let Me Go Home' is a typically gutsy vocal performance from Project stalwart Lenny Zakatek. 'One Good Reason' packs a real punch through great percussion and Eric Woolfson's finely-crafted vocals. 'Don't Answer Me' (featuring Woolfson again) is another catchy cut. 'Dancing on a Highwire' struck me at the time (and still does) as being the best track on the album, with Colin Blunstone excellent on lead vocals. 'You Don't Believe' is another rocker, with Zakatek again belting out a great gutsy vocal. 'Pipeline' is a typically classy APP instrumental.     For me, the two slower tracks don't quite measure up to the standard set by these rockers, but no matter - 'Ammonia Avenue' is a great collection of songs.     The reissue is welcome, featuring subtle remastering and the customary fascinating set of bonus tracks which, via rough mixes, demos and guide vocals, give a great insight into the production process. A departure from the earlier albums, then, but an outstanding collection of great songs by one of rock music's all-time great acts.

B000NJVWU0|5.0|Ah, the controversial one..... The Project reissue series has reached 'Eve', a controversial album ever since its release in 1979.     Let's not duck the controversy, misplaced though much of it is. The cover - more muted now in CD format than in twelve-inch vinyl - shows three veiled women who, on closer inspection, are disfigured on the shadow sides of their faces. The track titles - 'You Lie Down With Dogs', 'I'd Rather Be A Man', 'Damned If I Do', and so on - seem to underscore the controversial slant. 'Lucifer' - and references to the apple tree - hint that the Eve of the title is Adam's partner (though it now emerges that this may not have been the intention after all).     The album was never 'anti' women as such, but does give an ascerbic take on the power that women can sometimes exercise over men. It's an album about women's strengths, not weaknesses, but the lyrics are undeniably uncomfortable in places.    However, if we assess the album on its musical merits - as surely we should - it's a tour de force. Every track is superb. 'Lucifer' is a stunning, dark and haunting instrumental. Regular vocalist Lenny Zakatek puts real grit and bite into 'You Lie Down With Dogs'. 'I'd Rather Be A Man', sung by bassist David Paton, is another gem. Dave Townsend injects exquisite pathos into 'You Won't Be There', and Chris Rainbow's great vocals perfectly complement the ELO-style orchestral flare of 'Winding Me Up'. Zakatek returns for the ascerbic 'Damned If I Do', which benefits from marvellous orchestration (and was later memorably performed in classical format by Project orchestrator Andrew Powell).     Thankfully, a much softer take on women emerges in the last three tracks on the original album which, unusually for the Project, feature two female lead vocalists. 'Don't Hold Back' is beautifully performed by Clare Torry (of 'Dark Side Of The Moon' fame), 'Secret Garden' is a beautiful piece, and we conclude with another great vocal performance from Lesley Duncan on 'If I Could Change Your Mind'.    As well as being controversial, 'Eve' is sometimes disliked even by those who otherwise like the Project. As far as I'm concerned, it's a superbly crafted and innovative album which fuses great melodies, crisp lyrics, great vocal and instrumental performances and some exquisite orchestrations.    The nicely-remastered reissue contains some great bonus material, and these additional tracks are amply demonstrative of the perfectionism that went into the original production. Forget the controversy, admire and enjoy the music. A great album from a class rock act.

031237593X|4.0|This is the first book by Sharon Kay Penman that I've read and I have to say that I'm very impressed.  Penman does an amazing job of laying before the reader the tangled web of deceit that surrounded the reigns of Edward IV and Richard III in way that makes it easy to understand.<br /><br />This is the story of The War of the Roses and the life of Richard III.  We follow Richard Plantagenet, Duke of Gloucester, 'Dickon', as his family calls him, through the deaths of his father and brother, the rise of his brother Edward to the throne, Edward's death, Richard's crowning as king and his eventual death at the hands of Henry VII.<br /><br />Penman shows the reader the potential motives behind the endless betrayals as well as the scandalous rumors that were rampant during the time.  The story brings to mind the old saying \\"keep your friends close and your enemies closer\\".<br /><br />Yes, there's a lot of history and a lot of people with multiple names to keep track of but I don't know that I've read another book where the author was so generous in keeping them all straight for the reader.  I confess that I always read with paper and pen in hand so I can keep track of 'whose who', and I did with this book as well, but Penman offers so many opportunities to clear up any confusion that I found I referred to my notes on 'whose who' very little.<br /><br />The book is broken up into four different parts and while I found the first part a bit dry and heavy on the battle scenes the rest of the book is much more expansive.<br /><br />I was moved by this story, fascinated by the history and very impressed with the writing.

This time I listened to the audio book read by the author.<br /><br />If you have never read or listened to Sedaris before, you are missing out big-time. His witty sarcasm, as he tells a variety of stories about his family, his neighbors, his attempts to quit smoking, flying on a plane and so many more were just quite funny. He is an amazing writer who is able to convey stories about life with humor. I do have to admit some of the stories in this compilation left me a bit flat. My favorite Sedaris audio collection is still: Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim.<br /><br />Okay I have had enough of David S's writing for a while, so I'm off to more serious stuff.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is one of those dark, disturbing and insistent stories that compels you to watch, even when you'd rather turn away to a sunnier subject. It reminds me of \\"Chinatown\\" with its unsentimental view of the past and sinister subtexts. It's more than a story of greed and commerce in expanding late 19th century America; it traces a man's ambition to get whatever he wants at whatever cost.    Such a universal theme is usually to be found in Shakespeare, and requires an actor with enough emotional heft to pull it off. Daniel Day Lewis is as hard as stone in the role of Daniel Plainview, the driven oil prospector who sacrifices everything on his way up (or is it down?).    The film has a number of scenes that show how far Plainview will go to achieve his dream, but the one that clinched it for me was the oil derrick fire, drawn out in an almost agonizing pace by the director and stoked up by a mesmerizing score. Plainview and his crew, having unplugged an underground cache of oil, scramble to contain a flare-up that threatens to destroy both men and machinery. The scene starts at dusk, and as night falls, the combination of flames and inky black sky heighten the drama. With very little dialogue, the actors play out a modern myth: Prometheus bringing down the sacred fire. It's a chilling scene when Plainview, staring out of oil-streaked eyes at the derrick, mutters to his assistant that the rig is OK, but that his son (injured in the initial explosion), isn't. You can see the calculations that Plainview makes throughout his career that eventually catch up with him.    There's so much in the way of film surprises that it would be best to see it for oneself. I highly recommend this movie.
B000W1V5VU|2.0|I loved the first one but was confused by the second until I rewatched it a few times. Ocean's 13 is even more confusing and I have NO desire to rewatch this mess of a film. The plot is just way too ridiculous and even more far fetched than the other two films. Also, I felt that the characters didn't really work as a team as in the other films. I just didn't feel like they gave it their all, and were just in it for another paycheck.     Also, I found that the actual dvd quality was terrible. One of the worst I've ever seen. It just showed up extremely dark and saturated on my 46\\".    There is absolutely no point in watching this film except if you like the actors in it. Other than that, the film is an utter confusing mess.

0375826726|4.0|There are good and bad things about this audiobook.     The good things are in the audiobook, its length and reader:     its great at 54 hrs the reader is truly magnificient. He'd have to be or you would chase him with a knife.  Actually look him up in the phone book, go to his house, hit him on the head and then chase him with a knife after 54 hrs of narrating if he wasnt a gifted reader.  This guy was great.      So this audiobook was great company to clean the house, ride the bike, cut the grass, you get the drift.  Relaxing.    There was a lack of progress in plot.  Lets hope he does not do a Robert Jordan.  Plot advancement was not significant in any way for that investment of time.  The story went off in many different directions it did not have to go.  It neglected to go off in some ways it needed to progress to the end of job.  Which was resolution of the battle with Galbotroix.    Spoilers. Spoilers.  Spoilers.  Spoilers.  Spoilers.  Spoilers.  Spoilers.  Spoilers.    Spoilers.  Spoilers.  Spoilers.  Spoilers.         These are the bad things.   After I have made an investment of my time, a considerable investment of my time, and it appears the author has not paid due respect to a key character it ticks me off big time.  Has paid short shrift to a character.   Its cheap.  What was done to Glieder and his rider at the end of the Brisinger was just cheap, poorly and not well done or well thought out.  At all.    Last, this issue stuns me.  Saphira is a female dragon.  From what I can tell, she is the last known female dragon.  She and her rider are in a battle with male dragons and if successful will kill those other dragons known to exist riding for Murtagh.  The others are male.  I cant tell if Galbotroix dragon is alive or not.    The one dragon she is not trying to kill was Gleider and he strolled off to a battle that had a bad outcome for him. They did not mate.  Gleider was described as a huge handsome dragon.  I find this puzzling that he strolled offwithout ensuring his race would continue...before he risked his life.    In a space opera called \\"Deathstalker\\", they referenced an immortal all wise all knowing species that was incredibly advanced across the board in all ways.  This immortal species had undergone a civil war.  In its wisdom, after the civil war ended, there were only two individuals left in this species and both were ....males....    Mankinds chapter summing up that species is despite how great, wise and wonderful they were, they didnt think far enough ahead to leave a mating pair.  Their issue is to keep from oblivion, as they are inhabiting  their planet inhabited by two individual and are now a race and species of two that could never expand to beyond that two.    Saphira will be last free dragon.  So it stunned me, when Glieder strolls off into the sunset as the last free dragon to his death and Saphira watches him.  How is it that dragons with all their brilliance would do that unless knowingly they willing accept their race is going to be extinguished?        It occurred to me, wouldnt it have made more sense for her to lay or fertilize 40-50 eggs and then he stroll off to his death?  But no, the author as the other reviewers pointed out spent 500 pages on the Sloan the butcher, dwarfs king rituals, Orc rituals with Roan, it goes on.      Eragon and Saphira keep yammering they are the last dragon and rider, but she being a female and Gleider a male, she could have laid 40 eggs and they could have replenished their entire dragon race.  So instead, unless (a) she starts to consort with the enemy, or (b) kills them when they are defeated, Saphira will be a lonely dragon.      This isn't very smart for a species that is brilliant.  Its puzzling.    Overall, I enjoyed the audiobook.  I hesitated when I initially saw early reviews savaging the book, but when I saw how long it was as an audiobook, and the good reviews it had there, I could see it would be a good gamble.  It was, I was happy.  I look forward to the next book.  Its not a literary masterpiece. Yes it has flaws.  But as a relaxing book to use for yardwork, painting the house, steam cleaning the rugs, this is a hit.    I really hope this kid doesnt try to milk this for ll books like Robert Jordan.  That just will not play.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone: Memoir of a Boy Solider is a book that exposes the horrors of war from a child's perspective.  Yet, unlike the account of an observer, this power book is the story of a boy who fought in the Sierra Leon Civil War.  As a reader, it is impossible to be emotionally callous when immersing oneself in this book's pages, since its author presents a picturesque, emotive, and humane narration of his three years as a boy solider.     Beah's writing style makes it difficult for the reader to put-down this book once it has been picked-up.  The language is simple yet descriptive and informative.  Likewise, the author's timeline layout of the book provides a realistic approach to the telling of his story, since all chapters are rationally connected.      There are many times in the book that I was moved to tears by the heinous actions that Ishmael had to endure as a boy solider.  Whether it was the death of his family, seeing his friends die in the frontline, or having to drug himself to make sense of his world, I was able to empathize with Beah's feelings of frustration, confusion, despondency, and fear.     I strongly recommend this book to everybody.  As a work which speaks of the draconian reality of war -a human invention-, I feel there is no person who will not benefit from reading it.  This book will make the reader reflect on his/her own life, and how tragedy, perseverance, and faith -non/religious- can drastically change ones life.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|I have to say neither the movie or the actors were bad if at all the actors portraying the characters did incredibly well but this movie just for some reason did not keep my attention unlike the X-men movies.  If you've read the comics for the early years of the Hulk Bruce Banner was hunted like this by the government to use him and how Bruce tries to contain or control his Hulk Persona and I like that the movie shows the same thing.  I can't say if it's either because I've read the comics or just wanted to see the big fight between Hulk and Abomination but I found myself wanting to skip through the scenes in between the Hulk scenes and the final fight.  But if you haven't read the comics or seen the first Hulk Movie I do advise not skipping the scenes otherwise you will become confused on what is happening.  The video and audio for the blu-ray version are incredible nicely detailed and sharp and hearing the effects are astounding.  So I say while the movie doesn't reach the level of the X-men movies I put it in the same rank as Iron Man or the Fantastic Four movies.  So if you like the comic book movies this one is a good choice for you....

0670019933|2.0|My review is not focused on the content of The Dharma Bums as much as the production of the book itself. Let it be known this is one of my favorite books of all time and I consider it Kerouac's best. My issue is with the publisher, Penguin, who has simply revamped its \\"Penguin Classic\\" edition with Ann Douglas's intro to make a Hardcover.  Yes, Douglas's intro is excellent, but the only difference with this new Hardcover 50th Anniversary Edition is that is has 2 or 3 pages of a letter in which Henry Miller writes about The Dharma Bums.  For me who is a bibliofile.  I don't want a cheap quality cardboard book. I used to work for an Univ. Press and know about production options. Penquin basically chose the cheapest.  Every single copy in 3 bookstores were banged up.  You might say this isn't the publisher's fault, but it is because they didn't make a quality product that could stand even being stacked on a shelf, imagine opening it and reading it. People who want a 50th Anniversary edition want something special because it has a special meaning to them, if not buy the paperback.  So I guess that's what I suggest. The Penguin Classic edition has new artwork, quality paper and the same intro, without the high price. I wish Penguin would follow Knopf's example and do beautiful books like those in their Everyman's Library Series.

All I have to say is thanks to all of you who have ruined the book for me.  Bella, Edward, and baby makes three sounds intriguing but I like to be SURPRISED.  I think all of you are the ones who do the whispering in the movie theater giving away all the plots.  For Shame.   Thanks Again, Jennifer[[ASIN:031606792X Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga, Book 4)]]

B001GM28HO|4.0|Lady GaGa's \\"The Fame\\" is a must for anyone into dance/pop/electro music. \\"The Fame\\" and Lady GaGa has a lot of the style elements of Gwen Stefani and her first release; pure dance, fun, enjoyment and songs that are truly unique to her.<br /><br />The Good: The dance songs are by far the best about this release. \\"Just Dance\\", \\"Boys, Boys, Boys\\", \\"Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\\" just took me by surprise by how fresh they sounded. These are pop songs, songs that are meant to get you up on your feet dancing and having a good time. I was surprised by how many songs on this release are good because often times new artist have a few misses on their first release that simply don't work. \\"Starstruck\\" will please those looking for a little R&B/rap, \\"Paparazzi\\" will satisfy your craving for a little bit of a ballad (and this one comes with a great beat, nice lyrics), \\"Poker Face\\" is just beyond words, having a bit of a bite and edge to it in a similar production to \\"Just Dance\\".<br /><br />The Bad: Some of the more 'serious' songs fall flat and are a bit of a let down after the great pop songs. \\"Brown Eyes\\" and \\"The Fame\\" are my least favorite songs because they break away from the other songs and definitely don't carry on with the dance theme of the other songs. There are one or two other songs that kind of have a B-side sound to them but besides these two, the cd is pretty solid.<br /><br />Definitely a release you should purchase a check out. If you're a fan of Gwen Stefani, Madonna, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, then Lady GaGa belongs in your collection and on your list of favorite artists. Check it out, I'm sure you won't be let down by this different, fun, great release.
0316143472|5.0|Now, while I have heard a number of good things about David Sedaris' books, I have never actually read one before. Despite this, I was pretty excited about reading 'When You Are Engulfed in Flames', and I was not disappointed. Sedaris' newest book is a very funny collection of essays about ordinary everyday events in his life, or at least ordinary for him. All the stories in his book feel almost intertwined, possibly because they all to build up to a realization, almost like lessons he learned over time. Whether it is his realization that country spiders don't survive well in the city, or Sedaris eventually learning what makes one of his neighbors tick, Sedaris is very good at building a story over time. He can look at a number of events at different times and places, and see how he came to a better understanding because of these seemingly unrelated events. He also tends to make the simplest things seem more fun and exciting, such as quitting smoking. Not many people would decide to temporarily move across the world just to quit smoking. I think, in the end, David Sedaris is just skilled at comedy and story-telling in general. After all, isn't comedy just making the mundane amusing?
B001DD63UO|4.0|P!nk is back with her new release 'Funhouse'. As a P!nk fan, I think this release definitely shows off her growth as an artist and her vocals are definitely on spot. I have to say that I felt 'Funhouse' is definitely different from her previous releases. It's more raw, gritty, featuring her vocals and ability to evoke emotion through her voice and words. This is not like any of her previous releases in that it's not overly produced and, to me, sounds a bit more stripped down and basic. Yet, it still works and stands out as one of this year's best releases.<br /><br />The Good: In this release, the lyrics really stand out. Many of the songs' subject matter is lost love or the ins and outs of relationships. Most every song on this release definitely seems and feels more authentic. The sound or vibe of this release is more rock/acoustic than it is pop. \\"So What\\" stands out because its the most commercial/pop-sounding song on the cd. My personal favorite is the mellow \\"I Don't Believe You\\" that's simply the best lyrically, vocally and production wise with how simple yet emotional it is. \\"Funhouse\\" is another great track; very upbeat while using clever lyrics to deconstruct a good relationship gone wrong. The best part of this release from P!nk is that the songs are pretty relatable; these clearly weren't songs just handed to her and she's not singing about pointless things that she doesn't believe or have a connection to.<br /><br />The Bad: The only complaint I have of the cd is the running theme of bad relationships, broken hearts, lost love. It's an element of just about every song, and considering her personal life of late, that's not surprising. I think the release could have stood for a few more upbeat songs or songs that had more of an edge or bite to them such as \\"So What\\". It may be a matter of taste and preference but after listening to the entire cd, I found it a bit less memorable than her previous releases that were just packed with variety and different sounds. This cd, to be frank, was a little bit of a downer and depressing.<br /><br />In all, not a bad release and very high production values. P!nk does not disappoint and continues to stand out as one of the few creative artists left who aren't afraid to take a chance with their music and careers.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|I love this album. This album shows P!nk getting even more personal, more exposed, and more revealing. This album mixes sad, thoughtful love songs and fun, upbeat, feisty rock anthems. She named this album Funhouse because it is not just a breakup album, there is fun happening too. She also expanded her emotional and musical horizons on this new album. She looks at life like a carnival. Clowns are supposed to be happy but they are really scary. Carnivals are supposed to be fun but they are kind of creepy. That is the same as love and life. It is a metaphor for being in love and for life. I hope that this album will be promoted well.

B0019T9FL6|4.0|This album is one of the best that I've heard in a while, which is especially astonishing since it's a debut effort. Sure, there are a few songs that I could have lived without, but overall the incredible talent of Jennifer Hudson outshines even the weaker material.<br /><br />We've all heard the saying about some singers being good enough to sing the songbook, and it definitely applies in this case. Fortunately Hudson sings some truly UNforgettable songs like \\"Spotlight\\", \\"You Pulled Me Through\\", and my absolute favorite \\"We Gon' Fight\\". I could honestly listen to that song on repeat all day and never get tired of it. The gospel song that closes out the album is both uplifting and refreshing, and I can almost hear the ghost of Mahalia Jackson possessing Hudson as she sings.<br /><br />With vocals and improvisational ability comparable to greats like Whitney Houston and Patti LaBelle, Jennifer Hudson will definitely leave her mark on the music scene.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|John Legend's new CD \\"Evolver\\" does as it says on the tin. It showcases the singer's evolution with him raising the tempo on his songs (the sunny upbeat Lead-off single \\"Green light\\" with Andre 3000 and a two step beat) and even exploring Reggae (the tender Lovers Rock of \\"No other love\\" featuring his UK protege Estelle, and the bonus track \\"Can't be my lover\\").<br /><br />Other upbeat numbers include the dance song \\"It's over\\" (featuring his buddy Kanye west), \\"Quickly\\" featuring Brandy, \\"Satisfaction\\", and the African-tinged inspirational \\"If you're there\\". Legend said of this album that it doesn't sound like him, and going by these afore mentioned songs, he's right.<br /><br />No fear if you're a fan of the softer, more sentimental Mr Legend, there's ballads a-plenty; \\"Everybody knows\\", \\"Cross the line\\" (with booming bass), the piano ballad \\"This time\\" (very \\"Ordinary people\\" and featuring a soaring vocal performance), \\"Take me away\\" (Jazzy with lilting percussion), \\"Good morning\\", and the spare acoustic \\"I love, you love\\" (what a vocal performance).<br /><br />Another winner from the Legend.
B00004S367|5.0|Stevie does exactly what this album is titled \\"Music of My Mind\\" letting us, the listener, into some of his inner thoughts of love and realtionships.  Very insightful on a personal level from Stevie's point of view and individually as I remeness my past relationships during the time of the original release of this album.  His sound is haunting,almost spiritual, the music arrangments are of genius, I love the drums and percussions practically.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|Pink's new CD, her 5th, is anything but the \\"Funhouse\\" its title suggests. Sure there's upbeat stuff like the cheeky #1 hit \\"So what\\" (with its catchy \\"NA na na na\\" refrain) or even the dance/rock B-52's-channelling title track, but much of the lyrics is caught up in the anger/sadness/regret caused by her recent split from her husband.<br /><br />Other upbeat rockers include \\"Sober\\", the sunny retro sounding \\"Bad influence\\" and the lovely \\"Ave Mary A\\". However, the rest of the CD comprises ballads; the tender acoustic \\"One foot wrong\\", the Country-tinged \\"Crystal ball\\", the Blues-ey \\"Mean\\" and the accusatory \\"It's all your fault\\" being standouts. The melancholic \\"I don't believe you\\" showcases her raspy vocals in a most heartfelt way. Stunning and my absolute favourite!<br /><br />Now, while I love Pink's ballads, I feel the CD is rather ballad heavy, and the divorce-driven lyrics do get rather tiring after a bit (I blame Alanis for making angst-filled lyrics so trendy, lol!!). However, there is enough of the Pink charm to elevate it above the ordinary.<br /><br />A grower!!!
031606792X|2.0|I have debated whether or not to write a review about this book since there are already so many well written ones for and against it, but I finally gave in and decided to throw in my two cents worth.  So, here goes:<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this final chapter of the Twilight saga because although it is written in a fashion that allows you to still get lost in the story and continue to turn the pages, there were just too many poor creative choices that marred my opinion of the characters.  Without giving away too many details or adding spoilers, SM had her main characters making choices that were inconsistent with their personalities.  In doing so, she weakened Edward and turned Jacob into an even more spoiled and petulant child than he already was.  I already had trouble believing in Bella and Edward's love for one another because it seemed the only thing that defined their existence.  Bella states that Edward has a brilliant mind aside from his beautiful face and body, but I am never really shown that.  All he does is pine and worry for Bella to an irrational degree while stalking her whenever she thinks he isn't around.  That really gave me the creeps.<br /><br />Bella suffered some horrible stuff in this book and it is described in full graphic detail, yet we couldn't have one romantic scene of her finally giving herself to Edward?  We have been teased and teased for three books and when the time comes for them to finally consummate their union, we get black out after black out.  The sad thing is SM is perfectly capable of writing a very tastefully described romantic scene.  Why didn't she?  (Judy Blume got a lot more graphic over 30 years ago in her book \\"Forever\\" and its intended audience was teenagers.)  Either SM was poorly advised against it, or she chickened out.  Why did she think we could stomach the horrific more than some much needed romance?  It's the simple romance between these two characters that made Twilight the success it was.  Why did she make it so much more complicated then it could have been?<br /><br />The climax becomes an anticlimax.  No one gets hurt and everyone gets what they want.  If I had it my way, I would have had a huge vampire battle where Rosalie and Jasper get killed--maybe even Esme.  Not because I disliked these characters, but because a great book comes with sacrifices and doesn't shy away from the tragic.  Instead clumsy little Bella becomes a superhero vampire who now takes on the role of protector instead of the protected.  I would have preferred to have Bella remain human just until the end of the book so that the readers could continue to identify with her.  Then her transformation would have been brought about in a more intimate scene with Edward and not what we were given.  The vampire genre is all about the bite.  That's why it's so popular.  To summarize my opinion of BD, I borrow from SM:  \\"Ugh!!\\"so much more complicated then it could have been?     The climax becomes an anticlimax.

B00000J7SS|5.0|When this album can out in '69, jazz was in a state of flux, alternating between the mainstream, traditional swing and rock'n'roll. Miles had been flirting with rock rhythms and vamps in his later albums with his famous 2nd group (Shorter, Hancock, Carter & Williams) with \\"Miles in the Sky\\", \\"Filles of Killamanjaro\\" and \\"In a Silent Way\\" ( a colloboration with Joe Zawinul which also featured Chick Corea and John McLaughlin).  But with this ground-breaking album, Miles Davis created a new genre---fusion.  For better or worse, Miles wasn't about to look back but forward as he did earlier with his \\"Kind of Blue\\" album.  Many earlier fans thought Miles had sold out but I believe that he was true to his Gemini nature of wanting to break new ground. And of course with Zawinul's influence he did with extraordinary results. Tunes like \\"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down\\" and Shorter's \\"Sanctuary\\" would become staples of his group in concert.  If you're longing to break away from be-bop and am tired of it and swing--check this one out!!  It is as about innovative as the avant garde music of Ornette Coleman or Cecil Taylor.  Recommended only for adventurists in sound.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Received, the movie today, two sided DVD had the 3D side facing up! The 3D \\"glasses\\" scratched the disc. Loves the movie though.
B001G60FVG|3.0|This book definately grabs you from the beginning.  I found myself reading faster so that I could find out how it resolved. However the problem I have with the book is that it drug on in the middle.  It was as though the author needed to fill extra pages to make the book longer. The wrap up was odd too.  Almost as though the author had the idea for the beginning and then couldn't figure out how to end the book.

B0012GMUI6|5.0|Roger Waters is... a genius.<br />I can't say that few people understand his work because MILLIONS appreciate his music and lyrics, and I do mean APPRECIATE, not just \\"like\\" his music.<br /><br />Amused to Death is a 1 in a lifetime album and no wonder Waters didn't create another album yet (aside from Ca Ira) because to do something similar is quite impossible, although I hope that he takes the risk.<br /><br />Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking is a journey that you don't want to miss as well. Just listen to the words of Roger and the guitar of Eric Clapton and feel the music overwhelming you. A song like Go Fishing is a lyrical masterpiece. If you notice how he describes the seasons going by \\"We sat out in the spring...\\", \\"And the sun went down sooner each day...\\", \\"All the leaves have fell down...\\", \\"When the first snow flake fell...\\". Just WOW!<br /><br />If I get to choose one rock star to meet in my life, it would be Roger Waters.

B000OVLBGC|5.0|Rush Limbaugh recommended this film on his radio show and I came home and recorded it using the \\"On Demand\\" feature of Directv.  This movie is a moving masterpiece about the survival of humanity in a Stasi (State police) apparatchik.  Other have commented on the unlikelihood of such a character in East Germany, particularly one who had risen through the ranks of the Stasi who was so highly regarded he had an academic position at the Stasi academy.  I believe such fundamental expressions of our humanity are indeed possible even under such brutal and tyrannical circumstances.      Regardless, this is an enormously moving film.  Well directed, well acted and extremely well written.  Too often, movies end prematurely leaving the viewer left to wonder.  Sometimes, I think the director in this regard is too smart by half.  This movie ended at exactly the perfect spot.    For me, the movie was about courage and the survival of human dignity even under unbelievably oppressive conditions.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.  Ignore the few negative reviews, do yourself a favor and get this movie!  It is one of the best I have seen for over 5 years.
B000002UAU|3.0|\\"Before Sgt. Pepper, no one seriously thought of rock music as actual art. That all changed in 1967, though, when John, Paul, George and Ringo (with \\"A Little Help\\" from their friend, producer George Martin) created an undeniable work of art...\\"<br /><br />Really?? Before this album NO ONE considered rock music art. I didn't know. Guess they were just all wrong then weren't they?! Huh. And to this day it is \\"undeniable\\" that Sgt. Pepper is a work of art. Maybe...but *undeniable* is such a strong word. In anycase I find this album came at exactly the perfect time to maximize it's success.<br /><br />\\"I declare that the Beatles are mutants. Prototypes of evolutionary agents sent by God, endowed with a mysterious power to create a new human species, a young race of laughing freemen.\\" ---Timothy Leary<br /><br />Yeeeaahhhh. Well, people were getting into somethings and this album seemed to really connect. Does it still matter so much? Does it stand the hard test of time? The answer is NO to that question. Obviously it's  place in history is secured as one of the most important and influential albums in late 20th century pop music. Sgt. Pepper is undoubtedly an interesting album with the concept of creating alter-egos and an imaginary band for The Beatles as well as the studio innovations that went into the songs. Honestly though, the one song that truly stands out and I find interesting circa 2008 is \\"A Day in the Life\\". Why that is I can't put my finger on it, but that's how I feel.
1572705329|5.0|As with a number of Jane Austen's key novels, I love to read `Emma' on a fairly regular basis. It is a bright and fun story, full of witty humor, and comes complete with a slight cautionary tale as well. Where she thought herself glowing with strengths, Emma learns her weaknesses, and gains wisdom through her growing pains. A somewhat spoilt girl with a fairly easy life, awakes to a few realities. Still, the story is all quite light and airy. There is a little discomfort for Emma at one point, but true happiness, love and marriage in the end.<br /><br />Beyond the delicious romance of this treasure of a tale, I personally adore all the familial fun. Emma's father, Mr. Woodhouse, the supreme valetudinarian, is a darling as he worries about his and everyone else's health. Emma's sister and husband are also enjoyable, as are many friends and neighbors in the story.<br /><br />This was the Jane Austen novel I recommended my daughters read first, many years ago. I thought it a great start into the world of Austen. Indeed, it was my first recommendation to them of all the feminine classic literature that I adore. I advised them to start with `Emma'. It seemed `easier reading' for high literature somehow, and the story is so highly entertaining, especially to youthful young ladies, that I thought it a great way to introduce them to classic British literature of the best and highest kind. I've recommended `Emma' to many young and even older women who haven't tasted this kind of wordsmith finery before.<br /><br />I've become a grand fan of well-done audio-books, for `reading with my ears' when not actually reading for myself. With this Emma rendition at my fingertips, I can hear the novel in-between times. What better way to listen to an audio book than done by a brilliant professional actress like Prunella Scales. She does a wonderful job and I couldn't be happier with her voice tonality, interpretation and accents. Having played Miss Bates in a movie version of Emma, youmay recognize her voice in that character, but she also plays everyone else in the story excellently.<br /><br />There are numerous reasons to choose a top-notch audio book. While painting, driving, folding laundry, cooking or cleaning, or even simply `not sleeping', I can easily absorb Emma and other masterpieces time and time again! I highly recommend this one!
B00192KCQ0|3.0|I'll be very brief: it's okay. That's it. It isn't terrible and it's not great. Obviously they were going for an older sound found in their classic albums and re-created some of that here -but creating music on the level they once did back during their creative peak is something that probably ain't going to ever happen.
0307269752|5.0|IF YOU LIKE A MYSTERY BUY THIS BOOK<br />If You Like Character Development Buy This Book.<br />Mr. Stieg Larsson's debut novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is terrific.  An intricate novel that combines a complex murder mystery with a dysfunctional family saga,  a complicated person love story, intricate financial corporate intrigue, and an esoteric 50 year serial crime spree.  Well written, Mr. Larsson's keeps the reader in absolute suspense from page one to the end of this amazing tale.  In many ways this novel is a lot like an expanded and more complex Agatha Christie or Conan Doyle mystery.  Mr. Larsson builds the mystery as he adds facet upon facet until a complex mosaic leaves the reader wondering where the author will go next?  The good news is that Mr. Larsson does not disappoint as he weaves layer upon layer of suspense.  The basic thesis involves a discredited reporter who is hired to investigate and find the strangely missing niece of a very rich Swedish businessman.  From there the story grows into a labyrinth of who-done-its, as Mr.  Larsson brings in a multitude of interesting and in many ways despicable characters.  To go into more detail would spoil a wonderful tale of mystery.  Again, this is an extremely well done and satisfying mystery on many levels.<br />Character development was superb and the very heart of this novel.  Mr. Larsson's literary forte is his wonderful ability to develop numerous characters and have then all interrelate.  As the mysteries deepen, the characters become even more complex until the story reaches a thundering climax or should I say climaxes!  Bravo and well done Mr. Larsson.<br />Heavy use of raw language and some extreme violence but all germane to this tale of interpersonal relationships.  No gratuitous sex.<br />I heartily recommend this novel.  The beginning drags just a bit as Mr. Larsson sets the literary table but then by page 20 or so hold on to your seat as the roller coaster ride begins.  Could be book of the year.  If you liked Child 44 you'll love this novel.  Worth the hardback price.  I am looking forward with anticipation to Mr. Larsson's next novel .ked Child 44 you'll love this novel.  Worth the hardback price.  I am looking forward with anticipation to Mr. Larsson's next novel .
0143113100|5.0|Our daughter had a serious brain injury in 2003. The content of this book provided us with very contemporary, moreover, encouraging information.
0452289963|5.0|I was intrigued by this book when I heard about it on \\"Oprah\\" and had the strong feeling to get myself a copy.  This is one of the best spiritual books that I have read recently.  I have already read about the ego and books on how to change one's life perspective to a more positive one, but this book had many unique insights that are very applicable.  The author talks about what he calls \\"the pain body\\" and how we are attracted to others that magnify our pain bodies/push our buttons.  This was extremely fascinating and helpful part.  It took a few chapters to get into the book; but once I made it past some of the introductory insights, it really turned into a life changing book for me.  I even bought several copies for my friends and family, hoping that they appreciate it as much as I did.
B001C08RHA|2.0|Iron Man is the biggest disappoinment so far this year. I was so bored and confused by this train wreck, I lost interest after 45 minutes of nothing. Robert Downey Jr. is horrible, he brings nothing exciting as Iron Man, highly over-rated actor. I give this film two stars thanks to Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard, wish they were in it more, they are the real deal. This is one action film I won't be seeing twice, yuck!
B001CW7ZXK|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Has good clean video quality and pretty good sound quality.<br />*Includes some neat special features; a trivia game, a \\"Where are they now?\\" featurette (both on disc one), a new 98 minute making-of documentary, and the older 45 minute documentary (both on disc two).<br />*This gift set also includes a neat yearbook-style booklet and a huge glossy box.  The box is actually a little too big for the movie and the booklet, but die-hard fans will get a kick out of it.  I intend to use the extra space in the box for the Blu-Ray whenever it comes out.<br />*The movie itself is a classic comedy, filled with great funny dialogue and funny situations.<br />*The storyline is simple but fun.<br />*Characters are smashing, and well-acted; it is a great cast.  Writing is great.<br />*Soundtrack includes some good classy oldies.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Not for kids; contains swearing and sex.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*Some antics may be seen as immature; could be good or bad.  Some people might even get a nostalgic kick out of it.<br /><br />This movie is one of the most essential comedies ever made.  The dialogue is completely hilarious.  The characters are not only funny, but well-acted and great to watch.  There are a lot of funny memorable moments.  As a movie about frat boys, it can be a bit immature, but is not as bad as modern comedies of this type.  Highly reccomended to anybody looking for a good laugh.
B00005JPS8|5.0|This is one of the better comic book movies.  Acting, dialogue, storyline, pacing, special effects are all above-average.
B00005JG6Q|2.0|I'll make it short; there is no reason to fully restate the contents of this, as it's available from countless other authors and places.    *SPOILER WARNING*    I read the original comic (in Danish, though, and later in English), and in watching the Anime adaptation, I got severely disappointed. Yes, I know that you can never make a perfectly 'honest' translation of something from one form of media to another, but still, I had my hopes set for something more than this.    One part of it is the way the plot and storyline of the print version is torn apart and odd stuff that seems out of place is inserted in the animated version instead. Fx. (probably the most noticable difference, in retrospect) why is Akira reduced from a living being to a collection of formaldehyde specimen jars? Why has the foreign intervention been erased (the US Aircraft carrier in Japanse waters). Why is Lady Miyako changed from a withdrawn and insightful person to what appears a religious lunatic cult leader (i for some reason, found this insulting!)? Why was the Post-Nuke Neo-Tokyo cult following around Akira/Tetsuo toned down to the point of annihalation?    Too much of the good stuff that gave essence to the comic has been ripped out, and it shows.    Sitting back and seeing the movie end, and the scrolltext enter the screen, I felt robbed. I expected more than this. (Sure, it's an open ending, but you can surely make open-ended movies much better and more telling than this!).    Even though this classic is obviously praised by many of the old-timers, I wouldn't recommend watching it if you haven't already. (If you haven't read the print version, you may like it better that I have, but on the other hand, if you go ahead and read it afterwards....). I also expect to get a few flames directed at me too, judging from other responses to critical reviews on this board. Oh well. :I
B001F2W4Y2|1.0|When i first heard \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" on the radio it brought a wide grin in my face - i instantly bought the album and played it several times in a row.   With \\"Black Ice\\" i almost had to force myself to listen to the whole album and afterwards didnt remember a single song or guitar riff - i also dislike the sound especially compared to the very fat sounding \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" Album.   Hear before you buy !!!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|\\"Lost\\" is the most shameless cliff-hanger series I've ever seen, which is part of the reason I love it!  The DVD package is wonderful, with lots of commentary tracks, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and plenty of Easter eggs.  I was not disappointed.
031606792X|4.0|Since last Tuesday, I have barrelled through these books, completely ignoring my boyfriend, my family, and my job.     As an 10th grade English teacher, I was introduced to these books by several avid students. The thing that surprised me the most was the fact that I had a couple of \\"cool\\" boys slip into my classroom while I had no class to confess to having read the books. Whether it was a girlfriend who begged them to read them, or, as boy told me, his mother paying him to read them, they all loved them. I have been pondering using this book in the classes I teach for struggling readers, because it is high interest, easy to understand, and completely addictive. If you have a son or daughter who hates to read, but you desperately want to encourage them to do so, do them the favor of buying them Twilight. They will not be able to stop.     As far as the fourth book goes, I would first like to say that I really enjoyed it and liked the ending. I was a bit weirded out by Bella's pregnancy, but managed to get over it. My biggest beef with this novel was that it lost the characters in plot. Like the Harry Potter novels, as the authors become bogged down in cramming complicated plot twists and turns into books that are limited in length by publishers, they cannot luxuriate in character development. The sexually-charged, romantic, silly banter that made me blush, sigh, and giggle was missing from this book. And I think I can speak for most readers when I say that it was the romance we fell in love with. Edward really didn't even get to play the hero in this novel.     So I liked the happy ending, but wish that the old Bella and Edward relationship had stayed steady in this novel. Read it, but then reread Twilight like me. I don't know how I'll make it to November 21st...I can't think about ANYTHING besides this series.
B001CDLATE|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Supremely excellent video/sound quality.  Definately one of the best Blu-Rays on the market.<br />*Includes a couple of extras; a \\"A Closer Look\\" documentary and a \\"Restoration\\" documentary.<br />*The film has very excellent photography.  It shows a vast number of unique images with great composition and quality.  Most of it is downright stunning.<br />*Also provides some fascinating views of society, nature, people, and the world in general.  If you stop to consider the imagery, it could make you think a lot.<br />*At the same time, it could also be considered calm and relaxing.<br />*Provides some views of people, places, and events from many parts of the world that you may never get the chance to see.  It also has some very intimate portraits of people.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*On the selectable items on all menu screens, all of the text is gold and your selection is white, so it's hard to tell which button you are selecting.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*This is not a movie with any plot, story, or characters; it's simply a montage of world footage.  If you don't like documentaries, this may bore you.  Otherwise, it will amaze you.<br />*Comes in an eco-friendly package, so it's entirely recyclable cardboard with the disc shoved in a slit on the sleeve.  It's kind of weird and not very stable.<br /><br />This film has some of the best photography ever, both in quality and composition.  And on Blu-Ray, it's practically perfect.  In addition to giving me something to stare at intensely, it is also something that will inspire me; its views of foreign people, the things they do, their cities, their ruins, their rituals, and the nature that surrounds them are very detailed and revealing.  And unless you have ADHD, perhaps it will inspire you too.
B0015AARJI|3.0|I love the weight of the controller in your hand over the original non-rumble sixaxxis controller. It just feels more natural.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|very funny and sweet film.  Excellent music and hilarious situations.  I like watching this film because it helps me renew my faith in humanity.   some of the subplots are a bit extraneous, i think if they had focus on a few of them and developed them, it would have been a tighter film.   One of Hugh Grant's best films.  Bill Nighy is a scene stealer.
B000H6SXLU|5.0|DVD arrived promtly and is in great shape.  Fun movie, but about all those furs the ladies were wearing-ugh.
0061122416|5.0|In a way this book mirrors Paulo Coelho's own life. Early in his life he left a career as a lawyer in Brazil to travel throughout South America, North Africa and Europe and explore mystical and spiritual philosophies as well as the different countries. The hero in this book is a poor boy living in Andalusia who has a dream that tells him to go to the Egyptian pyramids where he will find treasure. A gypsy interprets his dream and encourages him to go the pyramids. A man calling himself the King of Salem presents him with the Urim and Thummin stones to be used for divination. Thus the adventure begins, one that leads him to North Africa where he confronts perils in the desert and finds true love on an oasis. His journey pits him against both physical and spiritual challenges that change and enlarge his world view. The story has the charm, magic and spirit of adventure of many classic stories and well deserves it place as one of the best selling books of all time.
B001DU8T6S|5.0|After one listen many people may conclude that Paul Rodgers of Bad Company dominated this CD. A few more plays will reveal that this is indeed a Brian May and Queen CD featuring exemplary vocals from Paul Rodgers and Roger Taylor. May's exquisite and majestic guitar tones and riffs gloriously resonate throughout this album. There are some incredibly poignant songs herein including \\"Small,\\" We Believe,\\" \\"Some Things That Glitter,\\" and the brilliantly emotive \\"Say It's Not True,\\" wriiten by Taylor and May. Paul Rodgers resonant vocals are excellent and guitar virtuoso and writer Brian May makes sure that the quality of this CD is akin to bona fide Queen Royalty.
B001ESYAJY|4.0|*\\"Time to Get Out,\\" provides a fast, boisterous orchestral opening, followed by a slow smooth James Bond theme.<br />*\\"The Palio\\" is moderately intense, and reaches a bit of a crescendo at the end.<br />*\\"Inside Man\\" is slower, but very smooth and slick with some funky guitars and trumpets.  Too bad it's only 38 seconds long.<br />*\\"Bond in Haiti\\" is a short tune with some tribal drums and strings.  It's pretty slick.<br />*\\"Somebody Wants to Kill You\\" provides even more tribal tunes with its drums, guitar, and tubular instruments.

Probably one of the awesomest tracks on this CD.<br />*\\"No Interest in Dominic Greene,\\" is a slow track with soft gentle strings.  It's rather dreary, but atmospheric.<br />*\\"Night at the Opera\\" is another soft track, but with a greater sense of urgency.<br />*\\"Restrict Bond's Movements\\" is yet another soft track with a dreary tone.<br />*\\"Talamone\\" is short, has some uplifting orchestration.  It's cool.<br />*\\"What's Keeping You Awake\\" is yet another soft track with a dreary tone.<br />*\\"Bolivian Taxi Ride\\" is really funky.

Very brooding and dramatic.<br />*\\"Have You Ever Killed Someone?\\" is short, but has some cool acoustic guitars and orchestrations.<br />*\\"Perla De Las Dunas\\" is a very long track, with fast parts and slow parts.

The lyrics and singing are alright. The melody seems kind of weird, especially between verses.  The chorus is moderately intense, but is short.  I rather like it, but it sounds like most people don't.<br /><br />As far as Bond soundtracks go, this one is quite good.  The orchestrations have a lot of interesting new sounds, utilizing different types of guitars, drums, and other instruments to create a distinctively foreign sound.

1594481717|5.0|A senior colleague of mine recommended this book, and it really is a great read - easy and fun, but substantive at the same time. Pink's argument's flow logically and the porfolios at the end of each chapter are a great resource, I found myself looking up all the websites and jotting down notes for activities to try.
B001G60FSY|5.0|There's not much substance to this book. Rather than being a resource of information, it is merely a book of examples. There is no broad takeaway you can gather from it after reading except to say perhaps that many of our decisions are based on split-second thoughts. But did you really need to read this book to find that out?
B001F0VHEM|5.0|P!nk's new CD still has her trademark sounds, however it's a little bit more mellow than the average Pink fan is used to. That's what's so great about Pink...she's real..she hides nothing. This CD is pretty much about her and the recent divorce. She's pretty raw in this CD. I personally love it...just like i love all her other CDs!
0345495004|5.0|This book was exactly what I thought it would be - a great insight into history combined with a fascinating love story. I couldn't put it down.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|I think people in general are over thinking this album.  I listen to this CD before going to work, because it puts me in such a good mood.  Isn't that what it's all about?  Why do people need to ruin it by worrying what groups Vampire weekend sound or don't sound like?  It's a great album, although some songs (\\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\") are better than others (\\"Bryn\\").
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show is one of my favorites.  And now I have the dvds, I so can't wait for the second season to come out.  I m going to buy all the seasons when they come available.
0375826726|2.0|Not a great outing really - overall reads like slightly earnest fan fiction and certainly not the work of a master.  The ingredients are all there and all good but the dialogue is so painful and all motives so sluggishly and painstakingly explained as if for the slow witted that the book really drags.  We are told what the characters' development is as opposed to simply being able to see it and discern it from their actions and words. I'm a completer finisher so I did finish the book but I started skim reading pages then chapters very quickly so I could move on to something enjoyable.  If you've read the first two you'll probably read this anyway, but try and borrow it - not sure I could recommend buying it.
B001E780W8|5.0|This Slipknot album is excellent!! It has a hard/melodic/crunch style and is addicting to listen to. The song Snuff sounds like it would be more Stone Sour like, but the rest of the songs are all Slipknot! Gematria is a sick song that I cant get out of my head. If you havent bought this album by now, your missing out.

B000001FLI|5.0|I got this album - tape cassette - back in 72ish. I had just bought my first car after landing a lucrative commission and played this over and over until - on the hottest day for 50 years - I left it on the dash and it melted! I had seen Buchanan on The Old Grey Whistle Test and was - as they say - gobsmacked - by his virtuosity.    Time passes... now after a life that went everywhere but where I wanted I am an old guy who can finally indulge himself - in a modest way - so I bought a Telecaster last week and am currently brushing up my limited guitar skills with the aid of Danny Gatton's incredible DVD. Gatton is for my money the better guitarist - in fact the best guitarist I've ever heard. How odd that both these talents came to such sad ends - hope it's nothing you catch off a Tele! Anyway the point of this review... this album has Buchanan's 2 greatest tracks on it and you'd be denying yourself a rare treat if you didn't rush out and buy it while stocks last! (then again - if you're a guitarist do yourself a real favour and get 'Telemaster')
0060007737|5.0|Great book. Very consistent with their previous books and full of exemples that corroborate with the ideas.
0321525655|2.0|This book is a good source of inspiration and ideas for slides, however, it overlooks key realities of many presentations. That is, most people create presentations that must stand on their own without the speaker because:<br /><br />1) They are included in conference proceedings. Most conferences have multiple tracks. Unless your slides have sufficient content, then those who missed your presentation are SOL.<br />2) They are circulated among business colleagues for collaboration or information sharing<br />3) They are sales or marketing presentations that are typically left behind<br /><br />These realities invalidate most of the principles of this book which recommends slides that are meaningless or content poor without the voice-over.<br /><br />What's needed is a book steeped more in the realities of Powerpoint than in artistry.

0375714839|4.0|It's tempting to say that Satrapi chose to write her memoir as a graphic novel because she's not very good at narrative writing, but to say that would be to completely undercut what this book has to offer.<br />Satrapi tells her story through brief narration and elegant black and white drawings, illustrating the repression in Iran (veiled women and bearded men drawn with no mouths) and the freedom of Europe.<br /><br />Satrapi takes us from her childhood in Iran under the Shah through her experiences during the Islamic Revolution. Her parents send her to Austria when she is 14, and she stays there for 4 years. An outsider in Austria, she returns to Iran, only to continue to feel like an outsider, because she did was not in the country through most of the Iran-Iraq war, and therefore didn't suffer through the bombings and terror that her fellow Iranians did.<br /><br />Back in Iran, Satrapi continues to be a rebel, but is able to enroll in college to get her degree in graphic arts. Throughout this section of the book, she depicts her personal struggle to reconcile her values with her life in Iran, and to find meaning in her life. She discovers that, for her, meaning comes through education, both personal and institutional, and leaves Iran again to pursue her studies in France.<br /><br />Through both her drawings and her words, Satrapi tells not just her own story, but that of others affected by the repression in Iran. That this is a graphic novel gives the reader the feeling of a special insider's look into that world.
B001F2W4Y2|3.0|to be honest a lot of it sounds the same and I did almost fall asleep the first time I listened to it. On subsequent listens it isnt bad, bit of a grower. Not great, not bad
B0000W6SYK|5.0|I was given this as a gift.  As a space program enthusiast I have read a lot.  This one is not written by a historian, author, or journalist.  It is a memoir of a person who was right there working it as it happened.  Kranz was there from the beginning, and helped design how the training and rehearsing was done.      This is a must read if you want to get an insider's point of view of how history was made.  It answered a lot of questions for me as to how NASA's magical team made the impossible become a reality.
0385340567|3.0|I've just recenly gotten back to reading mysteries and had heard a lot about how great the Jack Reacher stories are.  So I picked u this one and was absoutely overwhemed by the first half which I couldn't put down.  I loved the character right off the bat.  A loner who apparantly drifts into trouble where ever he goes is a character I can identify with.  However around the midpoint, the story, for me, completely loses steam.  I felt as if I was forcing myself to stay with it.  The incidents began to seem repetitious and let downs.It's not bad enough a book to discourage me from reading earlier books in the series, but I sure don't recommend it as one to start with.I give it three stars because I definitely want to read more about the character.  The first part really had me revved up.  I liked the characters, but lost all interest before the ending.
0446605409|4.0|Nelson DeMille is one of the best writers in the business, and \\"Plum Island\\" is a first rate cop novel.  It has lots of action, plenty of plot twists and a lead character (John Corey) who keeps the reader well entertained.  Despite its considerable length, the story is well told and reads quickly.    \\"Plum Island\\" is the first of four (so far) DeMille novels that feature Corey--a quick witted, acid tongued, male chauvinist, go for broke NYPD cop who finds himself on Long Island recuperating from gunshot wounds when he gets involved in the murder case of two Plum Island biologists.  Bio-terrorism is suspected.      This book has several really strong features.  John Corey is one of them.  His steady stream of smart alec thoughts and dialogue keep the reader engaged and amused.  The mystery is nicely developed and presented to the reader \\"Colombo\\" style.  Finally, the book has educational value both in its presentation of Plum Island, a real life government biological research center, and in the discussion of the culture, history and legend of the eastern part of Long Island.  I always like it when I can walk away from a book feeling that I have really learned something.    The book is not without flaws, however.  John Corey's attitude and attitudes will offend some readers, and there are points where his non-stop sarcasm becomes tiresome.   Also, the action near the finale goes a bit over the top, and the dialogue during one particularly tense action sequence is simply not realistic.   I won't say more lest I give away some of the ending.     I have now read all four John Corey novels out of order with no harm done to my enjoyment of any of them.  My favorite DeMille books are still \\"The Lion's Game,\\" \\"Up Country\\" and \\"The Gold Coast,\\" but I recommend this one highly.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|I see a review complaining about it being just the basic red/blue 3D that has been around since way back when. This movie does not deserve a bad rating based on that. It is a great flick and you can NOT expect the same 3D you got in the HD 3D theater. The 3D theaters use Stereo Optic 3D which is still IMPOSSIBLE for home use. It would require you to have two projectors and the whole deal like the movie theaters which isn't cheap. It is a GREAT movie with a great little 3D overlay added. It is not as good as the new Stereo Optic 3D theaters but unless you have about 20000 dollars to hook one up for yourself I think you should be pleased.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|The movie was not too long, just right I would say. Has good flow and well photographed.
B00012BSHG|5.0|This is amazing. I took this to india and it handles the heat here very well. Both my nieces enjoy spending time in this pool. I think it is good value for money.
B00000JXAK|3.0|A rare piece of music !  Not that many bands made music like Trees.  It's a mix of folk and soft pop.
B000E1155O|5.0|This album is hauntingly wonderful from the first time it hits your ears, or stomach, or fingers or finds its way into your dreams, your car, or beneath your skin. If you gravitate toward artists such as Vashti Bunyan, Devendra, Joni Mitchell etc... you will probably dig it. The recordings emit this honesty and emotion I cannot describe. From love to suicide, Baier paints intimate portraits that spring to life with her guitar (she experiments with  alt tunings and picking styles too). Not recorded for mass sales or a record deal, the album is simply fo' real and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys listening to an artist who throws all of their heart and being into their work. Did I mention her voice is beyond beautiful???
0060557818|5.0|This book got me completely into Neil Gaiman. I read all of his other books after this one. If you are already a Gaiman fan you'll like it even more.
B001DHXT2A|4.0|This time they got it right. It's every thing that 2003's \\"Hulk\\" was not. I'm a fan of the t.v series and loved the refrences to it. The music was brief but there. Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno were nice to see. I wasn't sure if Edward Norton would be to my liking as Bruce Banner but he definetly did a good job. If you like the Incredible Hulk this film will not disapiont you. No lack of action, story or good acting here
0151013837|5.0|This was something I couldn't wait to read again - excuses for rainy day reading. The book is humerous and gripping, and I didn't want to put it down. Just a wonderful story, made me feel like I knew Piscene \\"Pi\\" Patel personally. I look forward to other books by this author.
0974869449|5.0|Wonderful Flash Cards! A lot easier than one of those \\"complete books\\" of Kanji, at least for my purposes. My class just started doing Kanji  we do about 15 per lesson. So i just grab the ones I am doing that week and stick them in my binder. They are very helpful nice big pictures, they are sturdy and don't bend to easy. The stroke order is a must for your Kanji as well, which some books have and some don't. Also you get some nice vocabulary. I would recommend these to any Japanese Student. I have used them plenty!
B0009A21R6|2.0|Being an audiophile for many years (but keeping it on an \\"old-school style\\", ie relying almost exclusively on stereo format), I decided to purchase Dire Straits' \\"Brothers in Arms\\" in SACD format, in order to compare to previous existing versions I previously own. You may notice from this point that the SACD version received a \\"5.1 remix\\". Having one of the first (if not THE first) release of that album both in LP and CD version, plus several \\"remixes\\" bought over the past 10 years, I have to say that... the first leads ! Of course, on the first releases, the general \\"volume level\\" was lower, compared to what is done today, but far more subtle, with correct spacing and \\"deepness\\". Even if the SACD version is amazing on 5.1 and if the instruments sounds almost perfect (could be compared to the LP version, from that point of view)... unfortunately, the so-called \\"remix\\" is far from the expected quality for that kind of product. Ie the general volume of almost everything had been \\"pushed up\\", good for the dynamics, etc. Several instruments had been \\"dispatched\\" between the loudspeakers. Great for the \\"space\\", but not in favour of the music itself. Therefore, if you have a 5.1 (or 7.1) system, this record may be an excellent choice. But if you usually listen to music through stereo system (ie standard audiophile configuration), the purchase is not worth it. You lose more than you gain in terms of musicality and high fidelity sound (some instruments almost disappear because of the remix... and everything else try to be \\"in the front\\"). What a pity !
B00000295Y|5.0|...many high times riding around and bumping this in '93; it was the only way to go. Too bad that aural style, what originally defined the Soul Assasin Tribe, was eventually left behind. You know, gritty, scratchy, dusty, musty, old-school beat sampling, psychedelic phunky aura. On IV it is completely gone. I can't imagine what they were thinking when they quit doing the very thing that made them so unique. This is in my top 10 albums, check it!
B000M0XJ88|4.0|Nice pilot style automatic watch. As most of Seiko 5 serie goes a bit fast, but only a couple seconds per day. Nylon strap makes it looking great for casual purposes. The only reason I gave four not five stars is that it could be 4mm bigger, beacause 38mm makes it looking not too big (but not very small anyway). Consider it if you have small or average wrist. In case of big wrist watch could be seen as quite small while presently big watches are rather on top
B000UR9T8W|5.0|I'd seen all 3 movies prior to this purchase, however, this now enables me to view any of the 3 whenever I feel like it.  My only commentary is, \\"It's Spiderman\\".  I think that says enough.  I'm well pleased with the delivery terms, condition and quality of the products.
B000BCE918|5.0|These movies were a fun ride! You have to own them in their entirity! It would be a sin not to own all three. The dinosaurs are bigger, badder and getting smarter from each movie. Buy this!
B001DU8T6I|5.0|I LOVE Demi Lovato.She has GOT talent.She shows herself in this debut album.I'm a fan and of course GREAT CD.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|This music is a great representation of the movie. Relaxing to listener and it will change your mood for the better.
B000EK76K8|5.0|The product is exactly what I expected and works as anticipated.  Shipping from the vendor was very acceptable.  I'm pleased with this purchase and this vendors ability to deliver what they promised.
B000V86OKG|5.0|If you own the first season, youve got to own this one! What a great show! The story is wild and fun!
B000PDYVVG|4.0|This is not the type of book I would have bought for myself.  However, my mom gave it to me for Christmas and I found it difficult to put down.  It did get a little long and sluggish in the middle, but I'm glad I finished it.
B001CISHU4|5.0|Awesome as usual.  Amon Amarth has been around forever and never disappoints.  They stay even more true to their Viking sort of theme in this album.  Every song is centered around the Irish/Celtic  tradition and battle. The sound quality seems a lot better than past albums, especially the clarity of the vocals.  More great guitar solos as well.  The track list seemed a little on the short side but that may be just because I enjoyed every song so much making each one seem to go by fast.  IF you truly like Amon Amarth and can appreciate their content and style, then I recommend this album.
0375707972|4.0|When 15-year-old Michael begins a love affair with an older woman, his obsession with her becomes the center of his life.  Then one day, Hannah completely disappears from his life without explanation.  In later years as a law student, he encounters Hannah in a courtroom as a defendant in a Nazi crimes trial.  Hannah is ashamed of a secret so embarrassing for her that she would rather be accused as a criminal than have that secret come to light.<br /><br />Schlink unravels his narrative so seductively and in Michael's first person narrative we get a disturbing image of how the memory of Hannah has preoccupied him throughout his life.  While Hannah is portrayed in a sympathetic light in the final chapters of the book, there is that underlying immorality that taints her character.  Why would a woman in her thirties seduce a teenager?  Why would she turn down lucrative job positions only to end up as a Nazi guard?  Why would she play such a damaging roll in Michael's life?  The answers are sad and pitiable, but delivered with a poetic inflection that makes this novella a worthy read.
0783229526|5.0|This is the most hilarious and scary drug movie that you will ever see! Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro are fantastic in this as a writer and his agent! Christina Ricci and Tobey MacGuire make appearances in this! You wouldnt believe everything these guys did and they lived for many many years after this happened! Very adventurous and fun! Own this!
B001F0VHEM|3.0|I was confused when I first listened to the entire album. The first single \\"So What' is upbeat and catchy which gives the wrong impression of what the rest of the songs are like. The majority of the songs are ballads or just slow paced. Emotion is all over the place but its not as in your face honest as you would expect from pink. Instead its expressed over weird lyrics and acoustic guitars swirled with unusual beats. Its not as catchy as her other albums which makes it harder to get into. She's heavily experimenting here which sometimes works (The beautiful I don't believe you, crystal ball, ava maria). But mostly falls flat (one foot wrong, glitter in the air, funhouse).<br />Theres some amazing moments  here, but as a whole it doesn't flow together. The result is a good album that tends to be unusual or just plain bland at times.<br />Ill always respect Pink as a artist and a person, but this just isn't her best effort.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|It took about a week to listen to this complex and motivating recording to give an honest review. Sorry kids, I love it! This is Britain's most promising new bands. I am 44, and \\"old school\\" by many standards. My favorite British band is The Smiths. This trio seems to be following in their footsteps. Not as solid as \\"Iron Sea\\"(no pun intended) or yearnful like \\"Hopes and Fears\\". This material takes listeners to new frontiers, vaguely familiar in some corners-David Bowie? I like this retro sound because it is new material, not covers.    Tom Chaplin's soaring tenor still flirts with the \\"dark side\\". Nightmares, suicide and lost loves are all still very apparent. They are English, after all. This sets them apart from Coldplay, and other boy bands that may draw comparison. Its dance pop, not gloomy like the Cure. They have an elegance about them. At this time in their career, they are vibrant and energetic.     The are several potential singles within. The first 2 tracks have already been released. I can see \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" & \\"Black Burning Heart\\" as next. It is sad to think that there are disappointed fans. I guess they are not real fans. This is the band that I will remember this decade for. I hope they have a long, and creative career ahead of them!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|There are few television series' that hold a standard of excellence like \\"The West Wing.\\"  I bought the entire set when Amazon finally had it on the Deal of the Day and I am excited to watch each show all over again.
B000UJCALI|5.0|The Shining is one of the most classic creepy, Stephen King stories ever written! This movie will engulf you with the ongoing twist of events that is this scary movie! Jack Nicholson and Shelley DuVall are a fantastic pair! Watch this movie if you want to know the meaning of Redrum Redrum!
B000H5V8DG|3.0|I don't have almost anything against this collection, is everything that I expect and more, the content is very complete,superb quality and with lots of extras.   The only problem that I found was scratches in some discs  despite being wrap with the original protection plastic. This is the reason for the 3 stars in my rate.    Paulo Soares - Portugal
1592332803|5.0|Whether you choose to be vegan, enjoy trying new ways of cooking - OR cooking for friends - this cookbook is GREAT!  Filled with practical recipes and tips, everyone can benefit from it.  I've made 3-4 recipes and each one is outstanding - with rave reviews from those who sampled them.  I bought two other vegan cookbooks at the same time- this one (hands down) is the best!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Alecia Moore, aka Pink, sure knows a thing or two about consistency. For my money, there hasn't been a single pop star of this past decade that has delivered as many consecutive high quality albums as this girl. \\"Funhouse\\" does what nearly every Pink album has done: improves upon her last effort to become her best work yet.     On this album, a post divorced Pink tones it down a bit. Indeed, although the high energy mega hit first single \\"So What\\" and the 'fun' album title may lead you to think otherwise, \\"Funhouse\\" is decidedly more mellow than previous effort \\"I'm Not Dead.\\" I hope no one takes that as a negative though, because the tone of this album is perfect for the state Pink is in, in both her life and career. You'll still get a healthy dose of Pink's ever devilish fun side on this album, but most of the highlights of \\"Funhouse\\" for me are the mid-tempo and ballad tracks where Pink really shows she's starting to hit her stride as an artist. One example of this is \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" where Pink struggles with a \\"can't live with, can't live without\\" type relationship. The simple catchiness of the melody merged with Pink's perfectly emotive lyrics and vocal make for both an album and career highlight. The soul searching \\"Sober\\" and the helplessly regretful \\"It's All Your Fault\\" similarly combine a subtle radio friendly melodic flair with lyrical and vocal substance, for mid tempo perfection. Ballads like \\"Crystal Ball\\" and \\"Glitter In the Air\\" are stripped down songs, delivering insightful views on life, while the more radio tailored ballad \\"I Don't Believe You\\" just may be the most beautiful and emotional song Pink has ever done.     Like I said though, it's not all deep and low key stuff here, in fact my favorite track is probably still the ridiculously fun and upbeat divorce anthem \\"So What.\\" Sure the lyrics may be silly, but I'm not sure if it's possible for a song to be anymore irresistibly catchy than this one. And have you seen that video, how can you not love this? There's a reason it topped charts around the world, and finally gave Alecia that first U.S. solo #1. \\"Bad Influence\\" follows the \\"So What\\" mold, and is also a blast to listen and sing along to, though not on the same level as \\"So What.\\" Title track \\"Funhouse\\" is upbeat as well, as Pink starts a countdown to burn down a former happy house that is now \\"full of evil clowns.\\"     Overall \\"Funhouse\\" is Pink's best album to date, and is filled with commercial and artistic hits. I don't care for \\"One Foot Wrong\\", but that's it. This is basically an amazing pop album top to bottom. Right now, I think all these other pop stars need to look to Pink as the one to beat. 5/5 stars    My Top 5:  1. So What  2. Please Don't Leave Me  3. It's All Your Fault  4. Sober  5. I Don't Believe You
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I havent gotten into a tv show in over five years. Ive been pretty bummed about that too, then someone recommended this to me and I havent stopped watching! Im now watching the third season on tv. This show is so wonderful and awesome, you wont be able to turn your tv off! Give it a chance! The guy from Six Feet Under is back and sexier than ever!
B000W91RUG|4.0|If you enjoy the Big Bang theory, you'll love having the entire first season.  The only disappointment was that the \\"extras\\" left A LOT to be desired.. .no blooper reel?  Really?  Looked forward to a little more from the extras, but the show is fantastic.
B00138H63M|5.0|It was '74. I was a high school senior waiting excitedly for this record. Went to a head shop in the next town and there it was!!  I rushed home put it on and... whooosh!  it went right over my head.   And now 35 years later  I finally get it.  It's real, natural , organic Americana music.  His vocals were perhaps as strong as they ever were or have been since. And The Band is smokin indeed.   The moral of the story?  Always trust The Bob.
1897299214|5.0|Having recently visited North Korea for 4 of the wackiest, most surreal and intensely thought-provoking days of my life, I can recommend this book as the next best thing to visiting that crazy country.<br />The country is such a closed clam that the visual memories are those that sustain you as you ask yourself, \\"Did I really go there? Was it some insane episode from 'The Prisoner'? (sorry Guy, borrowed that one from you!)<br />The book captures in the most perceptive manner the horrendous mind-control that lies at the centre of this society. However, it also manages to make it laugh-out-loud funny at the same time.<br />I literally laughed till tears came at some of the moments illustrated in Guy's deceptively simple drawings. I even sought out and found the turtle in the lobby of the hotel he stayed in!<br />The book made me rush out and buy his (very disappointing) Shenzhen follow up and I'm currently reading his 'Burma Chronicles'. Sadly neither seems to come close to the 'Pyongyang' masterpiece.<br />By all means read Bradley Martin's ''Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader' for a comprehensive understanding of how the DPRK got into the mess it's in at the moment. But for sheer armchair travel, and even perhaps as a spur for you to go there, read this wonderful self-deprecating shrewdly observant laugh-fest. You'll thank me for it!
B000V4UFZK|5.0|This movie is highly recommended! The supernatural is something not to be tampered with and in this movie, you will see why! The spooks keep coming and the fun doesnt stop! For this price, why not add it to your horror movie collection!
1401307450|5.0|Scar Tissue immediately draws the reader in through its easy-to-read style. Some of Kiedis' stories are hard to believe, like drug use with his father at such a young age or the people he met and spent time with on intimate levels, but it's those events and people that keep the reader hooked. Although the book is sad at times when Kiedis tells of his repeated attempts at rehab and relapses, the ending is uplifing and inspiring.
0375826726|5.0|different reading from book 1 & 2, based more on characters than action. still, great to imagine what dragons would think :)
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie is cheap and WAY worth it! This is such a hysterically funny movie that you wont stop laughing while youre wondering who becomes a zombie next. Watch this insanely entertaining movie!
B000TGCR38|4.0|Purchased DVD at blockbuster sale.  Definitely a good deal. Other reviewers tell you the story, I'll just say that in my opinion it was a damn good movie, even tho some parts of it were tough to watch
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I may have a bias, as I've liked pretty much every Metallica album. I love their original thrash, and speed metal from their first albums because of the shear fun and complexity of songs like Creeping Death, Master of Puppets, and One. But I also liked their most recent albums because of the depth in songs like To live is to Die, Unforgiven, Nothing else matters, Bleeding me. Death Magnetic has an old school feel with a modern metal sound. So far, I can't stop listening to the following DM titles: Broken, Beat & Scarred, The day the never comes, Unforgiven 3, Suicide and Redemption, and My Apocalypse. Kirks guitar solos sound like solos from the first albums like Kill em All and RTL. At first the riff changes in DM sounded too random and chaotic to me. But after listening to it for a while, I noticed that they are impressively arranged. If you don't buy the whole album, I suggest the songs I've mentioned above. Rock on!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The first SD DVD box set of THE GODFATHER looked terrific on my SDTV, but its upconversion for the HDTV was the worst of any DVD I owned.  I was thrilled to hear of this new edition.  A couple of weeks ago, I was dejected by the Blu-ray release of a favored classic, and as a result, the knee-jerk desire to collect the latest improved edition is no longer part of my consumer profile.  I'll LOOK first.  Which I did with this: I rented it.  And I'm happy to report that it is as advertised, a restoration that's as good as possible, completely remastered, sound and all.  The grain level is more natural and the mottled highlights present in the first SD set are gone.  A couple of scenes are slightly blurrier than the rest, and there was one very, very brief scene that evidently could not be saved and looked as terrible as it did on the last SD set.  It was jarringly bad, but brief.  But the obvious effort that went into this suggests that the restoration team simply could not locate a salvageable print of that segment.  The rest of it is so good, I can accept this one ten-second flaw, and I'll definitely add this one to the collection.  Plainly put, this is it, as good as it'll ever be.  No matter how many times I see this, I'm still amazed at the level of acting, the rich characterizations brought to life with a thousand little touches.  These are people recognizable from your own life (sans the criminal activity).  It's no wonder that it won so many awards.  And it's no wonder that it ranks among so many top-10 lists.  No doubt, it will for years and years to come.
0780628551|5.0|Charlize Theron and Johnny Depp play a very in love couple! Something very strange happens to Johnny and he becomes very quiet around Charlize. One of my favorite indie actresses, Clea DuVall, is in this as well and does a really good job! Watch this if you love Johnny Depp but also watch it, if you like getting really creeped out!
0375826726|4.0|Brisingr by Christopher Paolini is an amazing addition to the inheritance cycle. The book is a little drawn out at times, but all in all it is a great book. It's very interesting to see how Eragon has changed, and how he manages keeps all of his promises. It is also intriguing to watch all the characters develop in this book. For example, it is interesting to watch Nasuada develop into a great leader for the Varden. You start to care for the characters a lot and worry if something is wrong. The only problems with the book are that it can get a bit boring at times and it is also full of different languages. I like to know what the characters say so a lot of my time is spent flipping back and forth between the story and the translation. The book is very suspenseful and it makes you eager for the 4th book.
6305161879|5.0|I give this classic comedy 5 stars.  It is particularly interesting because it makes fun of both American and English cultural styles, each side satirizing what they think is silly about the other side.  That makes this movie an insight into how the two cultures see each other - lots to learn from this!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Man,  this is the first Coldplay album I've purchased, though I've listened to their popular tunes in the past.  Every song is worth listening to.  The musical pieces all have an identity of their own, so that keeps you interested in listening to them over and over again(which I've been doing quite regularly).  The engineering is superb and that should be no surprise since Brian Eno is involved in the making of this album.    It's a roll down the window, bang on the steering wheel while singing at the top of your lungs driving album!
B000QXDED6|5.0|I give this 5 stars for artistic achievement.  This movie translates the artistic style of a comic (story board) successfully to the screen.  This becomes a master class in scene composition.  Every cinematographer should study this movie and learn it's lessons.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I JUST bought this DVD last week...today was my 7th day using it.  Let me tell you...this is working!  I am not really looking to lose a lot of weight.  I really just want to be in better shape. It's taken  5 months to find the \\"right\\" routine for me.  This is it! I LOVE it!  I can feel myself getting stronger, I have much more stamina (after 7 days!!!), and the work out FEELS good! I love it! Tommorrow----I'm moving up to level 2 and I am EXCITED
B00005JPSM|5.0|I have been waiting for the next \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" movie. It has been years since a really good, feel good saturday afternoon movie has come along. One of those watch anytime, a hundred times, movies that eventually ends up on Oxygen or AMC. I love the music in this movie and have ordered the soundtrack to go with it.   The only downfall of this movie was that Catherine kind of sucks in this film. I am not a huge fan of hers anyway. She is beautiful, but her acting sucks. I think the part would have been better played by   Claire Danes.
B0000C3I6U|1.0|just s bunch of cheating, juiced up, meatheads lifting weights and talking about it.  I could go to a Golds Gym and get the same experience.
B00000JBFW|5.0|My favourite Purple album by far.<br /><br />I love virtually everything about it. From the simple, yet iconic DP logo that i scrawled on countless surfaces to the thick and heavy production.<br /><br />From the opening riff of the dirty, dirty 'Knocking At Your Back Door' to the sprawling very 70's-esque title track, it's perfect Purple. Heavy, hard and tuneful with a dash of experimentation. It doesn't sound like supposed 'classic' Purple and it's all the better for it; this is a rejuvenated band showing the critics that there is still plenty of fuel in the tank and fire in the belly.<br /><br />Blackmore is buzzing and the writing is top notch. I'd say there is no filler at all, although the blend of styles from the straight rock of 'Not Responsible' to the slow 'Wasted Sunsets' and the recurring Eastern motif's in that epic title track may divide some purists. These are also complete 'songs' rather than a stitched together showcase for the individual talents to shine. As such, i think there is a greater overall cohesion to this album than to many of Purple's other efforts. It is very much an album from a band on form.<br /><br />One word must go to my favourite track 'Hungry Daze' which recalls the story telling of 'Smoke On The Water' a style of writing Deep Purple were always very good at. For some reason it always makes the hairs stand up and makes me want to stand up, jump up, play air guitar and sing-a-long. Any album with even one song that makes you want to do that is worth the money, especially at the price this classic is going for!<br /><br />So buy it!
0307276902|5.0|OK, I will be honest. The big mess on Ophrah is what made me want to read this book. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I had no problems whatsoever that this book was not an autobiography. It was still a great read. I have been around addicts who have been to rehab, and this is an accurate account for some. The story drew me in and made me want to read,read, read! I did not want to put this one down!   I was so hooked by the story, that I did not want it to end. I really felt like I was watching his world unfold right in front of me. Every character came to life.   GREAT BOOK!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|To be blunt, if Death Magnetic had been released after \\"...And Justice For All\\" we would all be talking about the 5 albums of classic Metallica before the Black album.<br /><br />Yes, Death Magnetic is that good.<br /><br />It's not a Master of Puppets, or a Ride the Lightning and there is no stand out track, no 'One' or 'Creeping Death' but as a whole it does feel like a logical progression from those first four classics.<br /><br />I've listened to Death Magnetic dozens of times now; at first with a big wide grin on my face and goosebumps; as a long time Metallica fan from the Ride era the weight on my shoulders has been lifted: Metallica are fun again!<br /><br />Subsequent listens and the hooks are revealling themselves. The \\"Show your scars/We die hard\\" refrain in \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\", the euphoric building of tension in \\"The Unforgiven III\\" and the layered guitar frenzy of the instrumental \\"Suicide & Redemption\\" are masterful pieces of vintage Metallica. The riff heavy opener and classic bludgeoning closer \\"My Apocalypse\\" recalls \\"Damage Inc\\" and \\"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\\". The slow and brooding \\"The Day that Never Comes\\" rolling and rolling until it erupts into a classic Metallica chug \\"Love is a four letter word, Never spoken here...\\" and then the thrash descends... It's awesome, it really is and anyone with the vaguest fondness for the Metallithrash is going to be head over heels.<br /><br />Yes, the album is far from perfect. Lars really needs a new drum kit (i can only imagine how good this would be with Gene Hoglan on the sticks! WOW!) The lyrics are schoolbook stuff and there's none of the gang style sing-a-longs a la \\"Master, Master...\\" And whether this is a cynical ploy to recapture their youth or the beginnings of a new era, we'll just have to wait and see.<br /><br />For now, Death Magnetic buys them the benefit of the doubt. Because it works. Metallica are on fire. James can still growl menacingly and Hammett sure hasn't forgotten how to piece a solo together. The songs stretch 7, 8, and 9 minutes long but nothing here ever outstay's it's welcome. And if they do sound like the best bits of \\"St. Anger\\", \\"...Justice\\" and (a little bit of) \\"Metallica/Load\\", then i'm not complaining. We can all play 'spot the riff' but while you are, i guarantee your foot will be tapping and your head nodding and a smile will be spreading across your face no matter how hard you try to deny it!<br /><br />Come on... Sing... \\"and we'll hunt you down without mercy, hunt you down all nightmare long...\\"and 9 minutes long but nothing here ever outstay's it's welcome.

B0010X745K|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Its chucklesome special effects and one dimensional characterisation never get in the way of a good monster flick. The original short story is one of the most gripping Stephen King has done and no director could really go wrong with the source material, however, I'm not as totally convinced as others who seem to want to rate this as a modern day 'Birds'. It isn't. There are too many 'Wait a minute...' moments. And that ending! I love to be surprised and I'm as much for a downbeat end to a horror film as anyone, but forgive me, this was laughable. Talk about twisting the knife one to many times!<br /><br />Spoiler alert, the ending is nigh... Skip to the last paragraph now to avoid disappointment...<br /><br />... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...<br /><br />The first thing that jars for me is the tentacles. Our hero hacks one off the monster and when he subsequently explains, to the whole store only a couple of people go back to view the limb. Excuse me? Flying tentacled monster stole the bag-boy? I wanna see!! Then the rubber thing conveniently goes and dissolves. Why? Cause it's a dumb movie...<br /><br />Then is the rapid conversion of some three quarters of the store to 'fire and brimstone' Christianity. I'm not above turning to religion in a crisis but this happens within 24 hours! The sacrifice of a soldier is thus, unrealistic. Considering we find out, in a cool bug skirmish, that 'the army done it' it would have been far easier and more dramatic for the crowd to turn on the soldier as some means of releasing their frustration at the scientists and the military and then turn to religion as absolution for their murder. It would have been very easy to script that into the movie, making the religious nut a more rounded, sympathetic character in the process. It would also have provided ample evidence of the fraying of these peoples lives and significantly increased the tension. But no...<br /><br />Third is when the monsters break in. The smaller ones are attracted to the light. The bigger ones swoop to feast on them and then come through the glass. Does anyone turn the lights down, even a little? Even after the attack? No. They revert back to candlelight for sure, but, even though I'm no entomologist, in my experience moths are as equally drawn to a glowing candle as to an arc light. Not these beasties. The store dwellers sleep happily and soundly all night.<br /><br />The fourth is the ending. Look away now folk's `cause I'm a-revealing all...<br /><br />It's just too hilarious. The hero escapes with his son, possible love interest and an elderly couple. They drive away unpursued by anything. Anything. Across State lines... Nothing. Passed pile ups and carnage... Nothing (The War of the Worlds is another victim of the 'miraculously clear highways' scenario after a super, mega disaster...) Ridiculous!<br /><br />And then the petrol runs out. The car stalls. The film could end here and it would be fine; an awesome creature feature. But no... The hero counts the bullets: five people, four bullets. It could end here and be viewed as compelling, with a cliff-hanger of 'Italian Job' proportions. But no... Despite none of the four adults having shown any signs of fatalism or depression they opt to end it. He makes the choice and shoots the others including his son (Utterly out of character! And, hey, no complaining, I warned you about the spoilers!) He screams his rage, leaves the car and heads out into the mist challenging the monsters 'Come on! Come on!' The film could end here and it would have been wonderfully downbeat. Certainly close to the classic status some have given it.<br /><br />But no...<br /><br />The mist clears and the Army come trundling along in their tanks and then, SECONDS later, refugee wagons roll passed full of survivors. Barely meters from the outskirts of a deadly, other-world disaster? Nonsense! So, the Monsters are defeated. Oh, if only our hero had waited 60 seconds... His tears flow. His rage and desperation! Oh no!! It's the egg that over eggs the pudding, the extra cook that spoils the broth, the straw that breaks the camels back. It turns the whole movie into a joke. Something you won't want to watch to the end ever again. Darabont blows it.<br /><br />... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...<br /><br />So, final advice: The Mist is a great, scary, tense movie with convincing CGI (if a little rubber in the prosthetics), frightening set-ups and just a little wrenching on the heart-strings and if you skip the last minute or even the last 30 seconds you'll love it for a long, long time. Just try not to smirk, laugh, guffaw, chortle or split your sides if you stay to the end because this is one movie that doesn't need a directors' cut it needs a studio cut!ration! Oh no!!

B000RW3YYA|4.0|The DVD set:  1. The editting is AWESOME.  I owned many TV Series DVDs Set and NONE HAVE THE EDITTING OF SGA.  The episode goes as a small movie and you  can not feel where the commercial breaks were.  2. The art on some of the slim cases does look, like a bad print.  3. The DVDs themselves are great, easy to take and put back in, nice art.  4. The complete case is very slim, so it does not take a lot of space in your library.  5. There is no booklet, and there is a small summary on the back cover of each case volume for the episodes.  6. The menu has a very nice graphic and it is easy to read (unlike season 1)  7. You have scene selection and comments on the episodes.    The story:    I agree with most reviewers that season 3 was weak and most of the stories were boring.    1.  The special effects were a step up from previews seasons.  Specially the season finale between the beam, the shield, the city going underwater, the city raising to space it was a complete extravaganza and well received by this reviewer.  2. The wraith were not touch upon much and their story felt like it stop on this season.  3. The character of Michael returns but not much happens with it; making you think why bring it up.  4. The replicators were a nice threat.  I do not watch SG1, so I was surprised to learn that they were used on that show.  Knowing that I do have a complaint of using foes from another show.  New Galaxy, New Show  there should be NEW THREATS.  On the other hand, I saw them as the BORG of the SG universe, of course cuter in this universe. =)  5.  I did not like the death of doctor Becket and specially the departure of Dr. Weird.  Unlike most reviewers I like her character, she seemed a little bland at times, but a strong leader at best.    Overall an excellent show, but four stars because the writing staff could do better.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|One of the best films of recent years.<br /><br />I reckon you can check out all the stars below so i'll just say, in the realms of SF it's in the top three ever just behind Blade Runner and Alien.<br /><br />That's not bad going, top three. Shiny!

B001GM28HO|5.0|With a title like \\"The Fame\\", you might think it is a self-fulfilling prophesy, something in Gaga's mind. But after listening to the album, you will see \\"The Fame\\" WILL be a self-FULFILLED prophesy.This is a glimpse into pop's future--a fusion of dance and electro...with a splash of disco. This New Yorker has worked hard and is going to get the glorious fame she definitely deserves.     Gaga is Pure ART. Lady Gaga is the creative production of 22 yrs of living---and it shows. One of the first pop artists in a long time to BLEED and FEEL art, putting her whole soul into MUSIC. Everything about the Haus of Gaga is astounding--the cinematic music videos, the slightly androgynous dancers who are awkwardly beautiful like lady gaga herself. The high fashion that Lady Gaga lives and breathes; a whole new culture has come to life. Innovation unseen, sounds never heard before.....Lady Gaga is here to stay.    I do hope Gaga blows up the pop stratosphere, because she is the medicine pop needs. As she said, she is trying to get people to think it's pop and squeeze some real art in too. A spoonful of sugar (pop) helps the medicine (art) go down. In an interview Gaga said \\"someone shot pop in the face--I don't know who or when.\\" Lady Gaga has all the elements to revive pop, and I damn well think she can do it! It is quite tiresome to hear people keep saying pop is just cheesy manufactured, lowbrow stuff--Gaga is going put the \\"culture\\" back in pop culture.     As the Lady says, \\"POP MUSIC WILL NEVER BE LOWBROW!\\"
B000URDEB0|5.0|The next time someone brushes off Goth music as being too loud to understand, point them in the direction of \\"Dark Passion Play\\" by Nightwish.  It is a beautifully presented modern opera with voices to match, and it lures you in to its dreamlike story.  If you only have time to listen to one sample, listen to \\"Eva,\\" and you'll see how different this music is from the norm and how talented the artists are. I am NOT a fan of Goth music, or I wasn't half an hour ago, but this Nightwish CD has changed my mind.     My only criticism is that every cut on the album is presented in the same key.  I wish the artists had stretched their vocal cords and changed key only slightly for a bit of variety.  However, this shouldn't stop you from buying this CD and immersing yourself in its beautiful sound.
B00104JONO|5.0|It's senior year for the gang at East High and they've got the basketball championship, drama club musicale, and Prom to anguish over.  As if that wasn't enough, Troy's squeeze, Gabriella, is headed for Stanford after graduation and he's slated for a basketball scholarship at U of Albuquerque - or maybe he'll pursue music at Julliard(!).<br /><br />This edition is even bouncier and more energetic than the previous two HSMs.  While short on dialogue, it's strong on the song-and-dance numbers which are outstanding as usual.  The kids are growing up but still look like ideal, freshly-scrubbed students and the Troy-Gabriella romance has matured and lost its coyness.  Zac Efron (Troy) is every tween's dream and carries the movie just fine.  He can sing and dance and looks great.  Vanessa Hudgens doesn't have much to do besides giggle, but looks good doing it.  The rest of the cast get little individual screen time, but as an ensemble piece, it's wholesome, high-speed fantasy fun.
B001F0VHEM|3.0|Funhouse is a bit of a misnomer for Pink's fifth and latest album, as it flies in the face of Pink's previous reputation as a somewhat vulgar pop troublemaker and focuses lyrically on her recent divorce and musically on forlorn ballads. Single \\"So What\\" is classic Pink, an electro-pop surefire hit by uber-producer Max Martin that starts off with Pink lamenting \\"I guess I just lost my husband / I don't know where he went / So I'm gonna drink my money,\\" before defiantly declaring that she's \\"still a rock star / I got my rock moves / And I don't need you.\\" It's by far the catchiest song on the album, but unfortunately Pink otherwise focuses more on the more depressing parts of heartbreak rather than keeping things fun.<br /><br />The production is in fairly good shape, with \\"Sober\\" rumbling along on a heavy snare beat and a slinky guitar and the alcohol anthem \\"Bad Influence\\" features a fantastic arena-drum sound and a propulsive bass line. Pink vocally is in top form as well for most of the album, although the lyrical themes of pain, loss, regret, and love tend to grate after six or songs.<br /><br />The record stumbles, however, on the ballads, which somehow make up practically half the album. Pink is much more in her element when she is singing angry pop songs about getting jilted or drinking copious amounts of liquor, and the ballads on Funhouse, while generally lyrically strong, cause Pink to sound like just another big-voiced pop singer with little to no depth. Not to say Pink shouldn't explore a little; the faux country-rock song \\"Mean\\" is easily the best of the down-tempo tunes here.<br /><br />For an artist whose has always been more than a little insecure, Funhouse is a strong record about a no doubt touchy subject for the artist, and more than a few songs perfect that mix between anger and triumph while showcasing her distinctive attitude and voice. If only she didn't rely so much on the songwriting choices of her producers, Funhouse could have meshed much better with the rest of Pink's admittedly solid catalogue.ink's admittedly solid catalogue.
0739462458|5.0|I am a total fan now.  I could not get through this book fast enough but I had to stop and reread passages that were so good that I had to do it and that was NOT confined to the terrific sex scenes.  This story has a great pace.  It could have been so easily a cliche, but not by this author.  The handsome rake, the beautiful virgin, the half breed Gypsy could have been cardboard figures in a formula romance.  Not this book.  I loved everything about it.  Kleypas can really write.  I am not going to go into the story like so many of the other favorable reviews, I will just tell potential readers that I used to be a person who thought I should only read \\"literature\\" where the stories are doom and gloom and the writing \\"intellectual\\" and finally unintelligle.  No more.  Kleypas has saved me from my English major dumps and gave me a story I was interested in, characters that were real and multifaceted, action that was believable and a love story that was memorable.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|As an avid fan of Pink, I bought her album unhesitantly.  After reading some of the current reviews about this being the \\"divorce album,\\" I'd like to point out would you be singing all happy tunes after such a devastating moment in your life?    The album is terrific, deep if I must divulge.  She asserts such emotional attitude, something that I don't think she ever really avoids.  Take a listen to the title track, Funhouse!  Also, rock out to tracks, Bad Influence and my personal favorite, Ave Mary A---makes you think.    All in all, worth every penny you put forward to purchase.  No regrets!  I've listened to the album 6 times this very day.  Peace!
B001DU8T6S|3.0|I'm baffled on how to write this review since it's either a Paul Rodgers solo outing, a Queen outing, or a Queen + Paul Rodgers outing.  I almost wished they hadn't of thrown in the \\"+\\" and just stuck to Queen.  IMO I can't give this 5 stars.  It's a middle of the road project.  And there will be tons of comparisons to every other Queen album out there with Freddie singing lead.  For me, this is a very dominated Paul Rodgers album since, of course, he sings lead and has a very recognizable voice.  If Queen wasn't listed on this you would have thought that this was his new solo cd.  Best track for me on this entire cd is 'Time to Shine'.  Other than that, nothing that grabs me.  It's fine to continue without Freddie, but I just can't see the Queen influence on this album which proves who the driving force was in Queen.  It is sorely missed on this album.  \\"Call Me\\" gives a nod to \\"Crazy Little Thing\\", but, for me, I just don't hear the guitar of Brian May that is so prevalent in all their albums (that Queen sound) on any of these songs.  Maybe, I'm missing it, but that's my opinion.  So, it's a good rock album, but I don't think great here and not worth a 5 star rating other than the fact that Queen + Paul Rodgers came out with a new cd.  If you love the voice of Paul Rodgers and haven't heard anything new from him, then pick it up even if you're not a big fan of Queen because it does lean towards the way that he has done music, both with Bad Company and by himself.
B000B5OD4I|5.0|I purchased this watch instead of an Omega Seamaster because I just became a father and couldn't justify the extra expense. After reading all the reviews, I took the plunge and I am not disappointed. This is an excellent watch for the price. I've had the watch for a month now and it seems to keep time well. The watch itself has a substantial heft and the band is adequate.

B0014Z4ON4|4.0|Three years after he successfully thwarted the Nazis attempt to harness the power of the Ark of the Covenant; Indiana Jones is back for even more adventure with \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\". Joining star Harrison Ford and director Steven Spielberg we have a new lead actress, as Kate Capshaw (\\"Black Rain\\") becomes the newest Indy girl, and young actor Jonathan Ke Quan as Indy's latest associate, the pint-sized Short Round; along with two new writers, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, that had previously worked with producer and co-creator George Lucas on his teen classic \\"American Graffiti\\". With all of the pieces in place, it was time for the adventure to continue, as \\"The Man in the Hat\\" was back once more on the silver screen.    \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" finds our hero (Harrison Ford) narrowly escaping a Shanghai nightclub, and traveling deep into the heart of India where he suddenly finds himself neck-deep in an evil plot to enslave the children of a small village. After discovering the source of the enslavement to be that of the sadistic Thuggee cult; Indy will do whatever it takes to save the innocent children from becoming permanent slaves in a labor camp, with the assistance of his diminutive sidekick Short Round and his newest bit of eye-candy, a lounge singer named Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw).    With the first film, the burgeoning Indiana Jones franchise established itself as a light-hearted, family friendly, action-packed, thrill ride full of adventure and wonder; however, with this next film \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\", the series took on a decidedly darker and more sinister tone. I personally enjoyed this darker take on the character and his adventures, and thought the film, even though it was more mature than its predecessor, was still full of fun and adventure that the whole family could enjoy; just with a few parts that the little ones may need to look away from or have explained to them due to the maturity level beingraised. Apparently, many fans of the series and moviegoers in general, felt differently than I about the direction this particular installment took. Many felt that the series was better served by a lighter storyline with more comedy and action, and not so much drama and even a little horror thrown into the mix. With that being said, most still enjoyed this newest adventure of archaeologist Dr. Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones, Jr., and even with the darker storyline gave this movie enough box office treasure to ensure another adventure would grace the silver screen yet again. So, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on the whole \\"tone of the movie\\" issue.    Harrison Ford fresh off his final turn as Han Solo in \\"Star Wars - Episode 6: Return of the Jedi\\", gave audiences yet another terrific performance as Indiana Jones, his second most iconic character in his long-lasting career. Having already played the role once before, Harrison definitely seemed more confident as the adventurous tomb raider; and the darker storyline allowed for a new, more dangerous side of our hero to be showcased, albeit briefly. I'm sure this new aspect of the character was fun for Harrison to play, and as a fan of the series, I appreciated that the writers took a chance on having Indy be a little darker in this film than he is in any of the others. Alongside Harrison Ford, we have actress Kate Capshaw as Indy's newest love interest, Willie Scott. Out of the entire film, if there was one thing I feel the need to complain about it would have to be Kate Capshaw's character. Now, I wasn't the biggest fan of Karen Allen's character of Marion Ravenwood in the first film, but after about the first 5 to 10 times Willie whines to Indy about this and that, I found myself wishing Marion would show up and deliver that same punch to Willie that she landed on Indy after they first met in the beginning of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". Some may think I'm being a bit too harsh, it's not that I disliked Kate's portrayal for the entire duration of the film, and I don't believe the whining aspect of the character to be completely her fault, I just thought that for the lead female character in the story she seemed far too annoying to root for or care anything about. This in turn made me wonder aside from her physical attractiveness, what could Indy possibly see in her that would allow him to ignore her lesser qualities like incessant whining or extreme materialism?    Joining the more experienced actors, we have newcomer Jonathan Ke Quan (\\"Goonies\\"), as Indy's hilarious sidekick, Short Round. His wide-eyed wonderment, along with the semi-father/son connection between he and Indy, made many of the really dramatic moments of the film even more touching, not to mention his wonderful comedic timing made some very tense moments a little less so, but without being out of place or detrimental to the story's integrity. Not to sell the rest of the cast short by not giving them their due attention, most of them did a really good job throughout the film, so they deserve a lot of praise as well; especially the actor who portrayed the leader of the Thuggee cult, now that's one voodoo guy that you wouldn't ever want to cross.    Oddly enough, \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" is actually intended as a prequel to the first film. Many viewers may not be aware of this fact, and I personally find it somewhat surprising to think that even back in 1984, producer George Lucas (\\"Star Wars\\" saga) was hard at work making yet another movie series move backwards in time once he had already established such beloved characters' with their initial movie(s). Here I thought this was something he did only recently when he revisited his Star Wars universe to create the first three chapters in his epic six-part space saga. Anyways, I digress.    To sum up, \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" is a much darker film than its predecessor, and to some viewers that can be construed as a problem for the movie.I personally disagree, but to each his own. Despite its darker tone, the movie is still full of action and adventure, and even some good laughs to lighten the mood, and I believe it to still be a movie that the entire family can sit around and enjoy together, along with the first one.    \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" is rated PG for violence and brief language.

B001F0VHEM|3.0|Pink's new record is another guaranteed smash hit...her first single, \\"So What\\", has already spent time at the #1 spot on the charts, with a handful more songs set to make their way through the Top 40.  One listen will have you hearing the hooks that will make it happen.    This is supposedly Pink's 'break-up' album (after her divorce from ex-hubby Carey Hart), but the title and the songs themselves have me questioning what's going on here.  This is the polar opposite of a concept album.  Of course, with Pink, it's always \\"expect the unexpected\\".    But even knowing that, something doesn't seem quite right here...something's missing.  Pink's revengeful lyrics seem half-hearted (maybe that's why it's called \\"Funhouse\\"?), and the music drifts all over the place.    One could argue it's an attempt at variety, but I'm wondering if Pink is going through an identity crisis on this record.    She explores so many musical styles and genres, from upbeat pop (with somewhat quirky interjections), to straight ahead rock (\\"Sober\\", \\"It's All Your Fault\\"), to a bluesy, country-tinged tune (\\"Mean\\"), to clean ballads (\\"I Don't Believe You\\").    She has vocally stellar performances on \\"Glitter In The Air\\", \\"Ave Mary A\\" and \\"Crystal Ball\\", but most of her hits will likely come from the beginning to the middle of the lineup, songs that are average at best (but have those aforementioned hooks in the choruses).    Overall, the music suffers from sub-par production...the overuse of electronica puts a damper on Pink's rock edge.  For example, \\"Sober\\" would have been much better served with real drums, rather than the 'splash of noise' drum machine sounds.    All that being said, \\"Funhouse\\" gets a passing grade...it's sure to please the majority of Pink fans...I'm just a bit disappointed.

B00000IMTF|5.0|Shortly after Ronnie James Dio's 300th birthday (troll years) him and Ritchie Blackmore decided to pick up some new musicians and record a follow up record to the legendary Rainbow record. The result was the brilliant Rainbow Rising.<br /><br />While I am a fan of much of Dio's work (and honestly, I really like the first Rainbow record alot...Temple Of The King? Man On The SIlver Mountain...I mean C'mon Now!) This is the best album he ever stamped his name on. At least the album that most strongly represents who he is and what he's about as a vocalist. I don't want anyone to think I'm knocking his Sabbath albums or his Dio albums, cuz I'm not. I just think that what happened here, was that Ritchie Blackmore decided he wanted the music to be a backdrop for Ronnie James this time around, and he wanted much more focus on the vocals, without distorting his own signature sound and therefore he changed the rest of the bands line-up entirely to get just the right atmosphere, and it works out very well. The album is only about 35 minutes, but it is one of those albums where everything is just right, and there didn't need to be any more stuff on here just result in filler.<br /><br />The album is prog and hard rock with lots of spacey and mystical type emotions in the background. Six Ronnie James titles, and they are all so very Ronnie James. TAROT WOMAN, RUN WITH THE WOLF. We get not only to be STARSTRUCK, but we also get to be STARGAZER[s], the latter an eight plus minute mega song. There are only six songs in total, but that is all there needs to be, the album is a triumph, and I'm suprised more of these Dio freaks have no idea.<br /><br />Truly, if you dig yourself some Dio, then you should not be without this offering. Play it loud in the autumn nights, and wail at the moon!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|We saw the film and ordered the soundtrack immediately thereafter.  Some good features of the songs:  1.  The CD only need be played once in a week; the other 6 days the listener hums, sings, or thinks the songs throughout the day.  2.  The voices of the two singers are not at all alike, yet blend remarkably well.  3.  The lyrics speak to adults and adult experience, unlike all of the snort-it/beat-it/screw-it music nowadays.  Very much like country and western music before C&W became popular.  The only drawback, a minor one, is that Glen Hansard's voice seems to possess that unfortunate property shared by Neil Diamond and Phil Collins:  despite being a perfectly fine singing voice, it is hard to listen to for extended periods.  Someone on Earth must know what produces that effect.  At any rate, the addition of the female lead serves to break up this effect and makes the entire CD an enjoyable and memorable listening experience.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This review is written by Mr. Bradberry's students:  The beatles' number one hits was a great album that they have put out. I think it was a great compilation of there hits. They put it together and had it sold in stores and they had there fan base grow 10 fold. But some of there songs that are on the album should not be on there and they also could have made it into a two disc set. The songs may be scatterd into many of there Cd's but they all came together in one great compilation and as you all can tell i give a five out of five.     If fans truly love the beatles they should buy this cd, and be prepared for a revival of beatlemania. unlike today's boy band the beatles actually wrote their music.     This cd gives the new generation a chance to experience the beatles.   the bands now a days have less origionalty then the beatles becasue some bands read from a script.
B00127RAJY|5.0|All I have to say is \\"wow\\"! I have been doing arobics for years. In the last 6 months, I've done the zumba workouts. Compared to those, this is intense! I was sketical how much could a 20 minute workout do because I usually do about an hour of zumba, but now, I am a believer. I could barely do a level 1 workout without stopping! I am impressed. I ususally feel the soreness after a new routine the next morning but I really felt the burn during the workout! Within the first 5 minutes, you feel it. I know I will get results with this one.
0439023483|5.0|Having read the Twilight series (and enjoying them very much), I read this one due to Stephenie Meyer's recommendation.  I completely enjoyed this book! I think I actually enjoyed it as much as the Twilight series, if not more.  This book is suspenseful and keeps you wanting to know more.  The description of the book doesn't do it justice - read it, it's worth the time.

For me and maybe some others as well am having a hard time getting this book and no its not because I'm slow or do not read often (I love to read), but because i didn't have the patients to keep re-reading to understand what is going on in the book!

031606792X|5.0|I thought this book ended as it should. It's hard to please everyone when writing a book, but I thought Meyer did an above average job with completing this series.     It also leaves it open for perhaps more stories over the years...    I think most people will enjoy the final book, but there will always be a few disappointed.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|I remember first hearing this album, playing my vinyl 2 lp of A Nice Pair, which featured the first couple albums of the Floyd (Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Saucerful of Secrets). Which remain my favorite albums by the group, followed by More and Animals<br /><br />Listening to this album in stereo (one of these 3 discs is the original album in stereo) .. whoo! Heaven knows what people made of the noisy guitar on Pow R Toc H when this first came out here in the States on Tower Records!<br /><br />Firstly, the sound. Never sounded better. You get the original mono mix. The 30th anniversary that first saw the album in mono seems to have clipped Flaming - it sounds fine now remastered for the 40th anniversary..<br /><br />I give the nod to the mono mix, as thats the mix the Floyd originally supervised. An organ track is missing on the stereo Interstellar Overdrive - oops! Exciting track regardless<br /><br />You will need both! (mono/stereo)<br /><br />Sigh. Yes, Vegetable Man, Scream thy last scream were left off the 2007 remaster at the last sec (according to Mason). They're difficult tracks to listen to, and not Syd at the peak of his powers, but it'd be nice to have them<br /><br />The early singles are very nice however, as is the alternate version of Matilda Mother (which has the original Belloc lyrics)<br /><br />So you will need it<br /><br />Do I wish the band would put out more outtakes from 1967 (what a year!) Oh sure. \\"Reaction in G\\" is a tantalizing snippet the group prerecorded for a BBC Top Gear session (according to a news article, the track was a song written in reaction to having to play Emily live; the band didn't play their singles live). \\"Millionaire\\" (aka \\"She was a millionaire\\") would be nice to turn up, as that was going to be the third single after the UK hit See Emily Play<br /><br />But, regardless, its a very nice package. It only came out cos of Syd dying of course. Its a fitting memorial to the man however, with a nice little sketchbook he worked on, lyrics, lovely pictures. The third cd is still wonderful (heck! Piper at the Gates of Dawn on discs 1&2 is wonderful!) Singles, outtakes and all<br /><br />It would have been nice to have everything recorded by Syds Floyd in one place however, which makes the omission of tracks like Scream, Vegetable Man pretty unforgivable reallyk!

B001DTPZNY|3.0|First, I must tell you that as a child I loved the Indy series. They had action, adventure, light romance, and simply tickled the imagination. I also realize that in these times of \\"special effects\\", a simple story of action and adventure may not appeal to the masses. Here in lies my dilemma, I liked the series as a child (not to mention several others like Fantasy Island, Love Boat, Knight Rider, Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Murder She Wrote, Remington Steele, Moonlighting, The Goonies, The Gremins, Star Wars, and other 80S, 90s TV shows and movies...I could go on and on and on, but you get my drift) and therefore knew, when compared to what sells today, this would be a hard sale. A continuation of a much loved story, with an older star and special effects to an old theme. Compared to Matrix and the recent Star Wars movies, this seemed to be not as exciting, but for those who love the traditional action adventure movies, they will be able to watch it and have no other expectations but to be entertained. While I do not think this is the best Indy ever, I wasn't as disappointed as other reviewers seem to be.     Now the review, which will be short and sweet. Indiana Jones (Professor by day, Adventurer by night) is still an adventurer who is able to use a whip better than those half his age. Captured by those \\"dastardly Nazi's\\" who are searching for the remains of an alien, who crashed in New Mexico, Indy must find the crystal skull which will lead to the Kindgom of the Crystal Skull and the City of Gold. Of course during his search, he encounters more Nazi's (including Kate Blanchett who sports a mean bob), double agents, old friends, old loves, a possible son, is the victim of nuclear testing, aliens and so much more. So, with all that said, I give this latest Indy adventure a \\"3\\". I wouldn't purchase it, but as a rental on a Sunday, with nothing else to do, I would give it a whirl.
B000Y9PILI|5.0|This complete makeover of the the great Songs For Beginners is amazing. The instruments have a \\"channel\\" of their own here. They are so clear and the sound-stage is huge. DVD-Audio should never die!!!!!    For anyone who has the original you will notice that the songs sound very different. The LP version and subsequent CD transfer has all the problems of mud and overdriven equipment that is very common in all of Graham's, Stephen's , David's and CSN&Y's recordings....Neil has the golden ears of the group so his music is always clear. So the background singers and B3, drums and bass really \\" change\\" the music...for the better.    Russ Kunkel's son, Nathaniel is one amazing engineer and recordist. He did the remix and DVD-Audio \\"construction\\" on this disc and on some others for the guys re-issue's. A genius of our time.    When you take out disc one you see the picture of George Harrison. He is on this disc!!!!! I did not know that.  So is the late Dan Fogelberg and Jerry Garcia.    This IS what it sounded like in the studio when they recorded it, sweet purity. The way it is supposed to be!!!    Great disc and a must have for sure.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|The music on this dvd /cd combo is excellent, Pink floyd songs are more alive than the original recording. A must buy for every music lover.
0887307280|5.0|If you are going to start a business or already have a business, you have to read this book or at least get the audio version.  This book is definitely a great choice.

B0013ND30W|4.0|I have never seen this movie all the way through. Bits and pieces of it growing up as it shown on TV. On Blu-ray it was a treat.

B000NJVWUA|5.0|The 1984 \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" contains nine songs worth of the Alan Parsons Project's shimmering,often brilliant progressive rock including the Top 40 hits \\"Don't Answer Me\\" and \\"Prime Time\\",with the lush ballads \\"Since The Last Goodbye\\" and the title track following right behind.The remastering(by Dave Donnelly and Alan Parsons himself)is impressivly  rich and vibrant,eclipsing the flat,old 80's disc with ease.Like the other APP Sony/BMG reissues,it contains bonus tracks,a colorful booklet rich with essays,photos and notes from the band members themselves.Anyone who enjoys APP should pick this one up in a hurry.
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|First you should know:    a.  I don't listen to AC/DC for the brilliant lyrics (there aren't any!)  I considered buying the deluxe edition of this CD (with the lyric booklet), and then thought, why the he-- would I do that?!?)     b.  I don't listen to AC/DC for intricate guitar work, key changes, changes in time signature (see: Rush, Dream Theater, etc.), experiments with synthesizers, piano interludes, etc.      c.  I listen to AC/DC so I can ROCK!     And so, my one criterion for this album's success/non-success would be, Does It Rock?     And my friends, yes indeed, this album surely, without a doubt, rocks my socks off.  Turn it up, open the windows, bust out your air guitar (put down your Guitar Hero, enough of that already), and scream along.  There's 15 songs on here, and the hit to miss ratio is pretty darn good.  And when it's turned up past 11---and Angus is playing his blues riffs at full blast---half the time I don't really care if the song is a \\"masterpiece.\\"  Nice work, though, AC/DC...it does live up to the hype.
B000NJVWTQ|5.0|Inspired by lengendary Spanish art nouvena architect Antonio Gaudi,this 1987 album shows the Alan Parsons Project still creating wonderful,melodic symphonic progressive rock well in its final stages,containg such gems as \\"La Sagrada Familia\\",\\"Closer To Heaven\\" and \\"Standing On Higher Ground\\".The remastering(done by Dave Donnelly and Alan Parsons himself)is a tremendous improvement,sounding warmer and richer than the harsher,colder initial 80's CD.That reason alone justifies purchasing this reissue.In addition,there are seven bonus tracks that are rough mixes and \\"various overdubs\\" taken from the original album sessions,a colorful booklet featuring a good essay by Classic Rock Magazine's Jerry Ewing,photos of memorabilia,and bonus material notes by Eric Woolfson & Alan Parsons.An superb job well done!
031606792X|3.0|So, everybody and their brother has reviewed this, and I probably don't have anything new to add to them, but I thought I might as well put my two cents in.<br /><br />I'm a forty-five year old man.  A middle school teacher, in fact.  I began this series back in August, (and read it all the way through), because easily half of my students are reading it. I enjoyed the first three, for the most part, primarily because of Meyer's detail when it came to the world she had created.  Though the vamps were not the classic ones of my youth, I liked what she did with them.  Bella was a bit too two-dimensional for my tastes, but the female students in my classes seemed to really like her, so I suppose the author pulled her off well.<br /><br />Then I read Breaking Dawn.  What a contrast.  I could tell right away that Meyer was under the gun contractually, because the writing wasn't nearly as tight.  It wandered and tried to turn and twist, but it was almost too predictable.  The only surprise was Jacob's imprint, but that left me thinking, \\"You're kidding, right?  How incredibly pat and superficial.\\"  It was as if Meyer were truly afraid to do anything approaching taking a risk.  The whole world must be happy and full of daisies, apparently.<br /><br />Even with all of that, I thought I liked it until one of my students asked me what I thought of the book. I could only look at her and say, \\"Well.  Em. Uh .  It was certainly interesting.\\" I thought it was a huge cop-out.  I wanted Bella to have a tougher time; Renesme is just a  little too convenient, and -- oh look! --  here comes the the cavalry just in time to save the day!<br /><br />In all, this was a disappointing end to an otherwise decent Y.A. series.  Meyer just wasn't up to the authorial task of creating a story with integrity and relevance.  Though the kids like the series, I've found that many of them felt it ended \\"lame.\\"<br /><br />I'm giving this three stars because any series that can make so many young people read voluntarily can't be all bad, and because it has at least given me the opportunity to talk about realistic expectations from life vs. the \\"Twilight zone.\\"<br /><br />bw<br />10/08<br />3/5 starsnd because it has at least given me the opportunity to talk about realistic expectations from life vs. the \\"Twilight zone.\\"       bw  10/08  3/5 stars
0061537934|5.0|It was a little twee in the beginning and I wasn't quite sure, but I kept reading and by the end I was weeping.<br /><br />This is a lovely book, narrated by Enzo, the dog, and tells the tale of his life and his beloved master. We learn to love Denny like Enzo loves him, and feel for him like Enzo feels for him. Also had some charming quirky insights into how dogs understand our world and how they feel about us humans. Felt oddly believable.<br /><br />I read this book in two days, it's a smooth, light read but packs a punch in the end. Highly recommended.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I just purchased this cd and I really love it.  You can tell she was going through a range of emotions after the breakup with her husband, but the songs are catchy and it is, overall, a really great cd.
0525478183|5.0|I came to this novel having read and been highly impressed with \\"An Abundance of Katherines.\\" I knew John Green was an extremely clever author with an insane amount of talent.    That said, this novel surpassed my expectations. Green weaves an incredible tale with unforgettable characters -- Margo, the mystery girl, Q, the lovable protagonist, and his cadre of misfit friends including Ben, Radar and Lacey.     The early scene with Quentin and Margo and their 11 tasks is just about perfect -- riveting, filled with surprises, beautifully rendered. The rest of the novel is a mystery and as a reader you're right there with Quentin, trying to figure out the clues. It's rare that I care this deeply about characters as I did reading this book.    There's also humor, great, great humor here. I laughed out loud repeatedly, to the point of annoying my spouse.    I've read many, many YA novels, as a YA novelist myself. And I say without question -- and I am not affiliated with Green in any way -- that this is the best, most complete, most brilliant work I've read in the genre. Read it.
B00005AG7K|1.0|This dvd is not a good investment.  It looks like it's been copied from a bad copy.  I bought one of these and almost threw it away.  I resisted the urge, but it's almost unwatchable, the picture is so distorted.<br />The best course of action in acquiring Magical Mystery Tour is to find one of the VHS versions that are an actual Apple product.  The movie is a stretch (even for die hard fans), but those VHS versions can be found in good shape, and let you see it clearly.
B000ZK4466|2.0|Weakest album to date.  Didn't like any of the songs enough to keep the CD.  You should definitely listen before you buy.  Hardcore TMV fans will probably be all fan-boy over this, but it's really not that great.  Sound quality on the CD is good, too bad the tracks are just blah blah.
1438242816|5.0|\\"Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity, to what we would have others think of us.\\"  Jane Austen<br /><br />I let my own foolish pride, my own ignorant prejudices; deter me from ever picking up a Jane Austen achievement until about a month ago when I finally decided to give her a shot.  This classic novel was definitely not on my `must read' list, but somehow, someway, it landed on my lap one afternoon and I decided to at least take a quick peek at it while no one else was looking.  After all, a man's man like myself (whatever that means nowadays) has no time to read early 19th century Chick Brit Lit., let alone a sweet, love story like this one.  Especially during football season!  I could almost hear Bukowski's ghost laughing at me when I opened up the first page and read those unforgettable first lines regarding man and marriage.  However, I forged on, just Jane and I, and when it was all said and done - I can't believe what a fool I've been all these years!  Yes, this classic is a thing of beauty.  And like Jane's main protagonist and narrative voice in the novel - Elizabeth Bennet - I too learned a valuable lesson about not judging a book by its cover.  Isn't evolution great?<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake I did.  I love classic literature, but for too long now I avoided such greats as the Bronte's, Wharton, Cather, et al... because of my foolish male ego, my ridiculous machismo pride.  My biggest regret though, was avoiding Austen all these years.  Now, I may not go out and rent the movie anytime soon (of course the wife made me promise that I would watch it with her after I introduced her to \\"Scarface\\" the other night), but I will definitely be purchasing some more of Jane's classics (Emma, Persuasion, Mansfield Park, etc...) and if they are anything like this pleasant surprise, I am going to be one happy camper.<br /><br />Never a dull moment, never a page not worth perusing, simply put - Austen is awesome!r.<br /><br />Never a dull moment, never a page not worth perusing, simply put - Austen is awesome!

1433502410|4.0|A second ESV \\"Reformed\\" Study Bible.  A wealth of information with a clear Reformed-Baptist bias.  That's not bad as long as you know.

Too much, \\"Paul doesn't mean what the text says.\\" The ESV is arguably the best of the translations available...a conservative RSV.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|Two of my favorite artists teamed perfectly together.  I think all the other fabulous reviews say it perfectly.

B001E7OO2I|5.0|The minute I heard \\"Ordinary People\\" from John Legend, I was instantly a fan!  I had Evolver on preorder and received it the day before it's official release on Amazon.  From the pictures online, I wasn't too impressed with the album cover, but upon receiving it, the cover has this metallic shiny cover.  Pretty fancy. ;-)<br /><br />\\"Greenlight\\", the first single is catchy and great to dance to.  It sounds like Legend and Andre' 3000 are both just making a song and having fun.  \\"It's Over\\" sounds like a straight throwback to the early `90s (the hip hop cooley sound).  It could be just me...Legend even does a little run at the end of the song that sounds like Teddy Riley.  \\"Everybody Knows\\" is such a sweet song.  It talks of working on relationships and the hardships and puzzlement that it brings.  \\"Quickly\\" takes it to a pop level with a long-time, no-hear artist, Brandy.  Her voice is a lot different and I have to take a little time to get used to it...like she's all grown up all over again! :-) The song itself will have to grow on me.  \\"Cross the Line\\" is my *first listen* favorite.  The vocals and beat just flow in a nice contemporary fashion.  This would be a great single--but for some reason my faves never make the singles lists!  \\"No Other Love\\" is okay and features Estelle, who folks are comparing to Lauren Hill.  I wish they wouldn't do that--she's unique on her own and if she doesn't reach the level Hill reached, will end up with an unfair bad rap.  That would be like if someone compared Rihanna to Beyonce...(!!!)  \\"This Time\\" is okay, it will grow on me like \\"Again\\" did on his second album.  \\"Satisfaction\\" is a pretty nice groove--I can also see this being a single (but I don't produce records, so I'm no expert!).  \\"Take Me Away\\" has a nice island beat and has Legend's vocals shining through--high ranges.  This is a great song!  \\"Good Morning\\" is a wonderful lover's song.  Something to listen to when it's just you and your significant other.  There is an awesome set of trumpets that fit well with this jam.  Reminds me of something by Earth, Wind, and Fire.  \\"I Love, You Love\\" has been on repeat since playing the cd.  It's Stephens' most wonderful ballad since Ordinary People.  This song is absolutely wonderful!  I wished it would have lasted longer!  Finally, the last song, \\"If You're Out There\\", I heard a few times during the presidential campaign, and I would compare with \\"Coming Home\\" from [[ASIN:B000HCPWZO Once Again]].<br /><br />The only negative thing I would say about this album is the amount of slow songs versus fast on this album, but it works for this album and it flows well.

006054094X|5.0|Before Columbus started his journey, he already had in his possession a world map presented  to the Pope by a Chinee envoy showing the American continent.  Since the map already showed the new world (American continent) that means some other people had already been there and in this case the Chinese.  Therefore, Columbus's claim that he discovered the new world was a false claim at best.  Capt. Menzies listed detailed evidence to argue his case that the Chinese discovered America in 1421, about 100 years before Columbus and he has succeeded.

When their bodies had finished scouring for gaps at the door, their souls rose up. When their fingernails had scratched at the wood and in some cases were nailed into it by the sheer force of desperation, their spirits came toward me, into my arms, and we climbed out of those shower facilities, onto the roof and up, into eternity's certain breadth. They just kept feeding me. Minute after minute. Shower after shower.\\" p.340
0385338082|3.0|Meet Emma....an average woman from London who is having a not-so-average day. Since the book has already been described here by other reviewers I'll explain why I couldn't give it more than 3 stars.<br /><br />I love humor in a book. I love all types of romance but I like it when a book makes me laugh. And Sophie kept my interest to the end. Lately, so many books I have read use the 'same-old, same-old' plots. This was something a little different.<br /><br />The sad part is the f-bomb is used throughout this romance.  I tolerate it once in a while in a contemporary romance but honestly, does anyone think a person appears attractive saying this word in public?  I also thought Emma forgave too easily regarding Jemima and her co-workers but I enjoyed it enough to try some of Sophie Kinsella's other titles.
143911000X|3.0|I bought this book along with Brocabulary for my semi-retarded (in a good way) younger brother. Weirdly, I ended up reading both of them.

B001GM28HO|5.0|Until today I had only read of this Mysterious Lady GaGa.  I waited patiently for this new release to come out and downloaded it first thing this morning.  All I can say is WOW.  I've listened to it twice through now and have to admit - it's a very good, very catchy, dance/pop CD.  As OPs have pointed it, it does have some similarity to Madonna's recent Hard Candy.  Both are very good, but there is something new and refreshing going on with the Lady's disc vs. Madonnas.  I rarely buy something without listening to at least one song by the artist, but in this case I went with my gut feel based on stories of the Lady I have read.  If you are looking for something new and different, this is it.  You won't be disappointed.  As an added bonus, it makes for great music to work out to!
0792160347|3.0|I was weary of turning the volume up and down during this movie.  Richard Gere is either mumbling or yelling.  Lauren Hutton was whispering the whole time. Although I thought she was great for the part, with her androgynous looks that would appeal to a line-straddler such as Julian Kaye, she needed more acting lessons.  She appeared nervous -- more nervous than her character required. I would have liked to see Julian with one of his older clients, doing what he apparently does best.  The movie got it backwards -- older women, it seems, want to be sexually noticed, and the younger women want someone who will listen to them.  Gere goes on and on about older women and the pleasure he gets from giving them pleasure, but all you see is him safely escorting older women, as a gay pal might do for any gal.  Gere has that ability to be both low-class and yet convey to others that he believes he's superior.  I'm surprised that Swedish madam didn't wring his neck and dump him in a bay. I just love the stupid scene in which she's not paying attention to her child with whom she gets only visitation, and Gere comes up with something like a \\"Hey, kid,,\\" and throws his ball to another area as if he were a fetch dog.  And the poor kid character runs after it. Just an upscale version of the strippers who have their kids backstage, being watched by God knows who.  It's seedy as all get-out, with great clothes. Hutton has the best wardrobe. I would have liked to see more development of why her character and Julian Kaye fell in love.  She makes it clear that it isn't the sex.  She seems to portray a depth that Kaye can't match, so what does she see in him to warrant love? Something shared, something more revealing would have been interesting. Was his last line really, \\"It took me so long to come to you?\\"  I couldn't hear well because of his mumbling.  But if so, that is hilarious, considering his earlier speech of how long it took him to help an older woman to orgasm.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I just love it,. This is a great showed story about King Henry 8,he was very sexy  and one of the most poweful man in the world. Passion, sex, desire - love and hate- great drama .I enjoyed every episode and now I can't wait to see new sezone. SUPER !!!!!
B0017ASV1C|3.0|Stupid - I think Al Pacino would have read that line out loud with some flair. I think the acting was OK. The problem is the script tries to overcompensate for a lack of drama. When I came to watch the movie, I expected that there probably wouldn't be as much action as in many movies. But it seems the scriptwriter(s) tried to compensate out of fear perhaps or perhaps that is how the book was adapted by flashbacks and all sorts of deceptions - it was not necessary. I just wanted to see two cops in trouble and their emotions acted out by 2 brilliant actors. Which I did in part. Too bad the story had to jump from the past to the present and future so much.

0439023483|2.0|warning, spoilers.<br /><br />My impression of Hunger Games, is that the premise of this book is fundamentally flawed.  The setting is a dystopian society where every year, they have these \\"hunger games\\" for 12-18 year olds.  They're basically fight-to-the-death battles.  So my question is this: WHY are 12-18 year olds forced to kill each other in a dystopian version of North America???<br /><br />Apparently, in this world, young kids fighting each other to the death is entertainment.  It's fun to watch for them. The winner gets to live a great life and the losers all die.  The premise makes very little sense.  It mostly got publicity because of Stephanie Meyer recommending this story, it didn't EARN it.  At first, i thought this book was going to be like The Giver meets Survivor, but it lacks common sense. The Capitol city is driven by Television, but the main character Katniss has to hunt food on a regular basis.  Apparently, she eats pinecones often. You never fully understand this lopsided society.  Is it futuristic? If it's set in the ruins of America, then what is television doing there?<br /><br />In the story, Katniss gets attacked by mutant wolves, giant wasps, and encounters senseless youth violence.  The graphic nature of the story didn't bother me at all; i just wondered why it was there to begin with.<br /><br />The love triangle between Katniss, a boy named Gale, and Katniss' hometown friend Peeta doesn't help either.  In the end, it doesn't play a factor in how the story develops. It DOES develop the characters, but it doesn't ring true to the plot.  It's NOT a character driven story, so the love triangle slows the story down.  In fact, the \\"games\\" don't even occur until after page 100.  You didn't need this kind of story for a love triangle or vice versa.  It doesn't play an essential role from beginning to end.<br /><br />This is the kind of story where you'll be scratching your head the entire time. SO many things happen that are illogical.  You have to be a forgiving reader to truly accept this kind of story.  I admit, Collins is a good word for word writer; her style and grammar are very good.  But that doesn't mean this is a good story and it wasn't a good idea.  The characters actually had promise, i admit that, but they were never given a chance to develop. The reader is forced to observe and understand the strange society the book is set it, so you never get to see the character development.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book because the premise basically ruins the story; it lacks logic and imagination. The 12-18 year olds killing each other \\"idea\\" only existed to market the story to young adults, it wasn't a solid story.accept this kind of story.

B000000OAH|4.0|The last of Queen's \\"No Synthesizers\\" albums was an incredibly mixed bag. From the opening oddity of \\"Mustapha\\" to the pastiche of the album that closes \\"More of The Jazz,\\" this album found Queen running amok through their stylistic grab bag, but without the coherency that marked their best albums [[ASIN:B000000OAC News of the World]] and [[ASIN:B000000OAN A Night at the Opera]]. Despite the inconsistency, \\"Jazz\\" includes two of the band's goofiest singles, the classic \\"Fat Bottom Girls\\" and \\"Bicycle Race.\\"<br /><br />\\"Jazz,\\" like \\"News of the World\\" before it, continued Queen's indulgence of excess.

There was heavy (\\"Dead On Time\\"), music hall lite (\\"Dreamer's Ball\\") and a great Beatlesque Brian May ballad (\\"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\\"). To foreshadow the next album, Roger Taylor drops the mechanical funk of \\"Fun It.\\" (Actually, a close kin to NOTW's \\"Get Down Make Love.\\")<br /><br />Queen was at the top and they darn well knew it. They wanted to be bigger than The Beatles and the one thing bigger (as the album notes explained, \\"Thunderclap courtesy of God\\"), and would spare neither expense nor excess. \\"Jazz\\" was the last album before slickness and the times overtook them on [[ASIN:B000000OAJ The Game]].mes overtook them on [[ASIN:B000000OAJ The Game]].

B0006Z2KYI|5.0|I won't add my unqualified praise to the long list of enthusiastic reviews, with which I heartily agree.<br /><br />The other day I saw a documentary about \\"Gentleman's Agreement,\\" which mentioned that it was the first Hollywood film to use the word \\"Jew,\\" which had supposedly been taboo because the studio heads did not want to call attention to their own ethnicity.<br /><br />Actually, Chaplin's \\"The Great Dictator\\" had dealt openly with the plight of Jews, in Germany, long before \\"Gentleman's Agreement.\\"<br /><br />But \\"To Be Or Not to Be\\" scrupulously avoids any reference to Jews, even though the characters in the story are obviously a company of Jewish actors, and director Lubitsch and many of the actors in the film are themselves Jewish.<br /><br />As if to underline the taboo, or perhaps to poke a little satirical bite at it, early on the script has Jack Benny, in a throw-away line that one could easily miss, nonchalantly order a \\"salami and cheese sandwich\\" -- a no-no in the diet of a traditional Eastern European Jew.<br /><br />The film even goes so far as to misquote Shakespeare, having Felix Bressart substitute the words \\"I\\" and \\"we\\" for \\"Jew\\" in Shylock's most famous speech. This shameless (or shameful, depending upon how you look at it) bowlerism could not have been overlooked by the more literate of those in the audience.<br /><br />Those same people may also have wondered at the choice of Hamlet's onstage \\"To Be Or Not to Be\\" speech as an opportune time for the Carol Lombard character to pursue a backstage assignation.<br /><br />Lombard's Maria Tura would surely have played Ophelia in the production. Immediately following the \\"To Be or Not to Be\\" scene, Hamlet comes upon Ophelia saying her prayers. There could not possibly have been time during the speech for Maria to have an offstage romance and still make her entrance on cue.<br /><br />These anomalies in the story are perhaps a wink at the audience, and no more improbable than a troupe of Jewish actors in Poland successfully impersonating Nazi soldiers, a general, and even Hitler.<br /><br />The film is both a social statement, albeit an obvious one, and a brilliant farce, and is one of my all-time favorites.ral, and even Hitler.

0743297334|5.0|As a young man I took the opportunity of a lifetime to spend a year living and traveling abroad in Spain.  Upon making this life altering choice, I began researching what novels I could read that could give me a glimpse into spanish culture--enter \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" by Ernest Hemingway.  At that point in my young life, I had never read any of Hemingway's works; since reading this, I've read the majority of his other works which, while mostly they were well written and enjoyable, no other book I've read, Hemingway or other, has had the same impact on me as \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"    Many reviews will break down the story line and interpretations of the relationships in the book, what I can say to you is that I am a mid-twenties male, married with a daughter, I love travel and sport, enjoy good wines, used to enjoy partying a bit too much, and am a bit of a guy's guy, and this is hands down the best book I've ever read.  My home library is not as extensive as I'd like to say, but I have began collecting this fantastic novel in as many editions as possible, simply because each year when I open the front cover, I know that I'm going to be gripped just as tightly by the story as I was that first time.    It's a simple read, and a quick one.  But be warned, you will want to read it again and again...and again.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|Sure - the new album has a slightly cheesy synth sound on many songs, some tracks sounding like Depeche Mode's \\"Music for the Masses.\\"  If these songs were redone with the pounding piano chords of \\"Hopes and Fears,\\" many fans would be happier.  But the difference is mainly cosmetic - let's listen to the songs, shall we?    The big, cinematic choruses are still here, but often lack the emotional intensity or drama of Keane's two previous albums.  This may be the price of fame.  The songs are inevitably less personal or autobiographical, and, like Coldplay, Keane have generalized their focus.  The album is about the loss of love in the world, and often slips into an advice-giving mode.  The songwriting is still good, but is somewhat less affecting.  That doesn't mean it's not likable... Oxley-Rice still writes a mean hook.    The new sound somehow makes this album sound more blatantly commercial and less \\"indie\\" or \\"alternative\\" than previous outings.  Keane also seem (again like Coldplay) to be moving toward Prog Rock on several longerr, more ambitious tracks, particular the title track and \\"Playing Along.\\"  They deserve credit for these ambitious works, but - they have lost some of the charm and innocence of their earlier stuff.    Still - this is a great pop band trying to stretch their sound.  The album stands up as catchy and engaging listening - once you get past the synths.

It is a bit funny, sometimes very funny, but more important, it shows children, that even if you think you KNOW what happened, there is always two sides to every story. It is an entertaining way to teach children not to engage or believe gossip, but to seek out the truth. Additionally, it shows how both sides involved in a conflict, can view the exact same situation in two totally different ways. This is an enagaging and enjoyable story, and fun for all ages!

1847370292|1.0|I won't try to expand on the work that has already been done in evaluating this book's merits, or lack thereof.  I would simply say that the entire basis for this book, the invisible energy radiated by the individual, may have some merit, but it is certainly NOT a scientifically proven fact, as the book claims.      For serious inquiry into this subject, I recommend Lynne McTaggart's Book, 'The Intention Experiment: Using Your Thoughts to Change Your Life and the World'.
0307341550|3.0|This debut novel is articulately written.  Bordering on the bizarre and grotesquely unbelievable, this novel examines one of the most dysfunctional 'Mommy Dearest' families ever to hit the written page. The novel's genre is hard to describe.  It is part thriller, part psychological mystery, partly a drama about family dysfunction, part murder mystery and partly a drama/memoir of the impacts of abuse.<br /><br />The protagonist has a history of self-mutilation, cutting herself so badly that there are no areas on her body except for her face and hands that she can't leave uncovered if she wants to hide her secret.  She has to wear turtlenecks, long sleeve shirts, pants, etc.  From a clinical perspective, a cutter is someone who suffers excruciating emotional pain that is persistent, hard to identify, and takes up all of a person's consciousness. Usually, cutters have a history of abuse/trauma in their own backgrounds. Cutting, as a metaphorical blood-letting, causes pain in a specific place and allows the pain to be isolated to one part of the body. As the blood flows, the pain goes.  In theory, once the blood is let, the pain identified and the intensity of the pain decreased, one is better able to function.  However, cutting is not a good coping mechanism because the true source of the pain is not addressed, self-mutilation creates it's own shame-based symptoms, and cutting becomes a form of self-medication rather than treatment for root causes.  Cutting is a short-term coping mechanism for a deep-rooted and serious underlying pathology.<br /><br />The protagonist of this page-turning novel is a journalist who returns home after many years with no contact with her mother and step-father. From the tim she enters the house, the reader has goose bumps because of the creepiness and fear-factor that the house and its inhabitants radiate. She notices that her younger sister is sexually promiscuous and using a lot of drugs.  This reminds her of her own sexual promiscuity and drug use when she was an adolescent.  She decides to investigate and find out what is lying in the dank underbelly of her familial home.<br /><br />There is an abundant sense of creepiness about many of the characters.  However,  no character is fully fleshed out.  The narrative is interesting and the writing is good, but there are too many odds and ends in the narrative that dead-end or are not followed through with.

B00009MGR6|4.0|AC/DC's 1988 album, Blow Up Your Video, is one of the better albums to feature vocalist Brian Johnson and was sort of a comeback after the uneven Fly on the Wall. Malcolm Young's strong riffs are still in tact while brother Angus' lead playing remains top notch. While there is no modern AC/DC classic here like \\"Thunderstruck\\", \\"Hard As A Rock\\", or \\"Moneytalks\\", this album is much more consistent than those that came after it. The best tracks here are the driving opener \\"Heatseeker\\", the wicked \\"Kissin' Dynamite\\", and the killer groove of \\"Mean Streak.\\" The more laid back tunes (\\"Two's Up\\" and \\"Some Sin for Nuthin\\") are also very strong. Other decent tracks include the hard hitting \\"Nick of Time\\" and the anthem \\"That's The Way I Want to Rock & Roll.\\" The only track you could really call mediocre here is \\"Go Zone.\\" All told, Blow Up Your Video is a very good album from AC/DC and probably the last one they made that was really consistent.

B000RZOR2U|5.0|This is the landmark 60-CD set of the complete Bach sacred cantatas recorded by period instrument pioneers Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Gustav Leonhardt with their respective original instrument ensembles Concentus Musicus Wein and the Leonhardt Consort between the early '70's and the late 80's for Teldec. I bought this in its previous incarnation, the most expensive single recorded music purchase I ever made at $400, it takes up what seems like three feet of space on my shelf, and I have never regretted it, out-of-tune boy sopranos, scratchy violas, an oboe d'amore player who seems to be learning his instrument over the course of several discs, and all. This is not period Bach delivered with the swing and polish of John Eliot Gardiner, this is raw, immediate, intimate and from the gut. And it just got hundreds of dollars cheaper. I don't know if this means a reduction in the copious annotation (hundreds of pages of commentary and translation) that accompanied my older edition, which would be a pity, because this set was both a labor of scholarship and a labor of love. But there is music enough here to last a lifetime, the very heart of Bach's oeuvre.    The aforementioned occasional failures of intonation and the deliberately scaled-down instrumentation and choral forces only serve to heighten the sense of direct communion with God; this is honest, not pious, and the rawness of the peformances convey a sense of fear, trembling, awe, and humility in the face of the Almighty. Other recordings may be smoother, but none are as powerful and direct. I may be indulging in special pleading for technical lapses (which disappear over the course of the set as the players and singers get a firmer grip on the tiller, but these recordings moved me in the same elemental fashion as my first hearing of such similarly raw, \\"mistake-prone\\" works as Robert Johnson's delta blues recordings, Hank Williams' I Saw the Light, and John Coltrane's Village Vanguard recordings.     These cantataswere written to elucidate the minister's sermon for every Lutheran holy day on the calendar; within a restrictive framework, in a 20 minute span, Bach delivered a hymnal chorale, a fugal burst from the chorus, recitatives, and solo arias. With these simple elements, though, he recombined instrumental groupings and explored a range of spiritual moods from exalted, to celebratory, to desolate, to consoling. The polyphony is staggering, the solos heartfelt, the orchestra simultaneously rangy and lush. This is the musical equivalent of Dante's Commedia, something to explore, meditate upon, music to both pray and dance to. There is absolutely nothing like it, anywhere.     If you wish to hear the workings of Enlightenment logic intertwined with \\"irrational\\" faith, two elements polemicizing atheists always claim are incompatible,so that the listener cannot tell where one starts and the other ends, check this out. Bach could not have written these pieces (on a weekly basis, over decades!) if he could not so marry his huge brain and his huge heart.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|I held off on buying this CD too early because -- to be perfectly honest -- the public fascination with that whole \\"I Kissed A Girl\\" song really annoyed me even though the song didn't.  I have to say that, now that I've had a listen, I've been pleasantly surprised with Katy Perry's work here, and I'd give it a 4.5 (on a 5 star scale) if Amazon allowed it.  Her voice is animated and fresh throughout, even on the few lesser tracks, and she takes the kinds of risk that Pink has built a career around, although Katy's vocals may be more of an acquired taste than most pop/rock singers.<br /><br />One of the Boys (5 out of 5): What do you do when one of the boys suddenly blossoms into one of the girls?  This is a song about the tomboy grew into the Homecoming Queen.  Something about the song reminds me of early rock from The Cars.<br /><br />I Kissed A Girl (5 out of 5): \\"It felt so wrong, it felt so right ...\\"  Gender-bending pop/rock'n'roll at its best.  It's all innocent fun until you find out you like it.  It's no wonder this song is a major hit for Katy.<br /><br />Waking Up in Vegas (5 out of 5): Sure, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas only so long as you don't marry some young pop starlet who ends up writing a hit rock song out of it.  Buyer beware, and have fun while you're at it!<br /><br />Thinking of You (5 out of 5): It's the fourth song on the album (and fourth in a row ... do I detect a theme here?) dealing with the need to suddenly re-examine one's place in the world; how do you deal with your new love when all you can think of is your last one?  Great acoustic guitar opening and ending to this track, soft, heartfelt, but still understated.  Personally, I think this is one of the strongest tracks here.<br /><br />Mannequin (3 out of 5): \\"I wanna hit you just to see if you cry ...\\" \\"You're not a man, you're just a mannequin ...\\"  Somewhat predictable and overstated teen-style angst. If I were a 16-yr-old girl in love with a high school quarterback who'd have nothing to do with me, this song would probably rock my world. But I'm not a 16-yr-old girl, so it does very little for me.<br /><br />Ur So Gay (4 out of 5): A (near perfect) perfect musical insult -- woman to man.  Jazzy with great horns.  Very catchy lyrics.  I can only imagine that Katy has great fun performing this one.  Again, a song penned with a youthful sensibility.  Any song that somehow works in the word 'penis' really deserves some props.<br /><br />Hot N Cold (5 out of 5): Electronica pop contemplating the timeless problems of hot/cold relationships.  Danceably fun with a great rockin' refrain.  \\"Someone call the doctor, Gotta case of the love bipolar ...\\"<br /><br />If You Can Afford me (5 out of 5): Well, it's either celebrating love or prostitution.  Take your pick. Either way, it's still a great, fun tune.<br /><br />Lost (3.5 out of 5): A close impersonation of Melissa Etheridge musically if Melissa Etheridge ever wrote about puking and porcelain.  A real candle-waving rock style song about being 'lost' in the world that makes great use of a music box style instrumental theme-line.  Wanted to like it more than I did come the end.<br /><br />Self Inflicted (4.5 out of 5): We all beat ourselves up over something. This is basically Katy's chance to tell us all about the habit.  Well done.<br /><br />I'm Still Breathing (3 out of 5): Love ends, but the individuals don't.  The track ends a bit unexpectedly, like some relationships do. Is that the metaphor?  You decide.<br /><br />Fingerprints (3.5 out of 5): Attitude rock, at best, the kind of stuff The Donnas have been doing for years now.  \\"Wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype,\\" so why end the album with such a middle-of-the-road rocker?  A good song, but I would've ended the record on a higher note with one of the more unpredictable 5 star tunes from above.would probably rock my world. But I'm not a 16-yr-old girl, so it does very little for me.    Ur So Gay (4 out of 5): A (near perfect) perfect musical insult -- woman to man.  Jazzy with great horns.  Very catchy lyrics.  I can only imagine that Katy has great fun performing this one.  Again, a song penned with a youthful sensibility.  Any song that somehow works in the word 'penis' really deserves some props.     Hot N Cold (5 out of 5): Electronica pop contemplating the timeless problems of hot/cold relationships.  Danceably fun with a great rockin' refrain.  \\"Someone call the doctor, Gotta case of the love bipolar ...\\"     If You Can Afford me (5 out of 5): Well, it's either celebrating love or prostitution.  Take your pick. Either way, it's still a great, fun tune.    Lost (3.5 out of 5): A close impersonation of Melissa Etheridge musically if Melissa Etheridge ever wrote about puking and porcelain.  A real candle-waving rock style song about being 'lost' in the world that makes great use of a music box style instrumental theme-line.  Wanted to like it more than I did come the end.     Self Inflicted (4.5 out of 5): We all beat ourselves up over something. This is basically Katy's chance to tell us all about the habit.  Well done.    I'm Still Breathing (3 out of 5): Love ends, but the individuals don't.  The track ends a bit unexpectedly, like some relationships do. Is that the metaphor?  You decide.    Fingerprints (3.5 out of 5): Attitude rock, at best, the kind of stuff The Donnas have been doing for years now.  \\"Wanna break the mold, wanna break the stereotype,\\" so why end the album with such a middle-of-the-road rocker?  A good song, but I would've ended the record on a higher note with one of the more unpredictable 5 star tunes from above.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|I could probably put everything I know about Pink into ... well ... I guess it would be into a single album review.  I know her real name is Alecia Moore.  I know she burst onto the scene at the same time as a handful of other pop singer/songwriters.  I know, for some reason, she hasn't seem to be given the same level of respect as some of her peers (though I've read one \\"professional\\" review that already dubbed this her \\"divorce album,\\" given her recent change of marital status) ... but that could all change with FUNHOUSE.  There's a 1960's one-hit wonder quality to the entire album, to every single track, a sound so magically captured in the Tom Hanks film THAT THING YOU DO!  It's fun, with a lot of attitude.<br /><br />So What (5 out ot 5): A perfect gem of a song.  When it comes to rockin' pop rhythms with lyrical attitude, Pink clearly commands the lead over her peers with driving songs matched with the killer refrains like that of \\"So What,\\" a musical shot of adrenaline.  Who cares what others say?  It in the end it doesn't matter b/c talent & attitude triumphs.  Never diss the rock star.  Celebrate the self.  One of the best tracks here.  A hit out of the park!<br /><br />Sober (4 out of 5): A melancholy rocker, introspective in a way only someone who's looked inside can pen and perform.  Personal demons are often driven by the actions of others (bad lovers, bad parents, bad friends, etc.), but only one's self-confidence can help you achieve lasting happiness.  \\"How do I feel this good sober?\\"  Indeed.<br /><br />I Don't Believe You (5 out of 5): Starts softly and swells in power, much like any individual's soul.  Only Pink's trembling & gritty voals can elevate the power to jilted love songs like these.  Tragically romantic though the love may have come to an end.<br /><br />One Foot Wrong (2 out of 5):  Is it jazz?  Is it electronic?  Is that a reggae beat?  I'm not too sure what to make of \\"One Foot Wrong.\\"  For the record, there's also a late 60's sound working here.  The track feels a bit experimental.  If it weren't for Pink's massive voice, then I probably wouldn't much remember this tune.<br /><br />Please Don't Leave Me (4 out ot 5):  Lyrically, the song truly shows Pink's vocal strength, alternating as it does between her contemporary singer and an almost lilting little girl backing \\"da da da\\" track.  A throwback sound to the teen beach tunes of the 1960's brought forward in time beautifully here.<br /><br />Bad Influence (5 out of 5):  Forgive me if I think that THIS is what Pink does best ... celebrating her own downright sinful badness.  Pop/rock with all the attitude you can fit between the start and the finish.  Actually, this tune has an odd theatrical quality to it, like it's destined to be featured in a rock movie musical or maybe just a real solid and wicked music video.<br /><br />Funhouse (5 out of 5):  Celebrating annihilation ... complete with its own countdown.  \\"This used to be a funhouse, but now it's full of evil clowns.\\"  The title track is exactly the kind of song your grandparents warned you about when they said, \\"Stop listening to that rock'n'roll ... it's so violent.\\"  Yes, it's so deliciously destructive, and it's arguably one of the best tracks here.<br /><br />Crystal Ball (5 out of 5):  Smoky & reserved, it's that other kind of song that Pink does extraordinarily well.  Just her voice & a twinkling guitar.  Questions about the future abound, but just greet them like you would any challenge, and you'll be fine.  Hint: even that crystal ball cracks, folks.  Honestly, I could listen to her sing this song and play that guitar softly for hours on end.<br /><br />Mean (5 out of 5): Pink does southern fried rock like Aerosmith does (and ISN'T that Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler singing back-up as he's done with her before?), complete with the blues-backed twangy electric guitars.  This is the kind of vocal performance that Grammy's OUGHT to be celebrating.  A big (but heartfelt) rock balladcomplete with the F word worked in for good measure.  \\"It's like a train wreck trying to hit the right track ...\\"  Asks and tries to answer the question about how, why, when, and where the relationship went wrong.<br /><br />It's All Your Fault (3 out of 5):  It's the kind of track you'll be hearing playing in the background of a Spencer's Gift store for the next six months and always wonder what that's all about.  Great driving undercurrent, the kind of track some kids love headbanging to these days.  For all its strengths, it's the kind of song whose lyrics either means something to you or they don't.<br /><br />Ave Mary A (5 out of 5):  A flat-out indictment of the world we've created, complete with questioning one's faith alongside with how we got where we are.<br /><br />Glitter in the Air (5 out of 5):  A song that speaks to the simplest, magical pleasures of life, like a child throwing a handful of sparkling glitter into the air.  Pink squeezes more depth, passion, and humanity into these four minutes that many of her peers squeeze out of an entire career.<br /><br />This Is How It Goes Down (5 out of 5)<br />Sexy, subversive, and sinful, the perfect exclamation point to this visit to the FUNHOUSE.  I could've done without the rap interlude by Travis McCoy, but that's only a matter of taste.<br /><br />Well, after all is said and done, what is Pink's FUNHOUSE?  I could be wrong (I've been wrong before), but I think she's singing about life ... the good, the bad, the tragic, the charm, the ecstatic, the love, the loss ... all of it rolled into one is the 'funhouse,' a ride that once we're all on board we have no other choice but to ride it all out ... thru the good times and the not so good times.  There's something here for everyone -- much like life -- and no one should walk away disappointed.  Musically, this album is absolutely terrific, and, lyrically, it's absolutely top rate.  I haven't felt so excited about an artist's total release in an awfully long time, and here's hoping that Pink finds the success she so much deserves with this trip thru her own personal funhouse.complete with the F word worked in for good measure.  \\"It's like a train wreck trying to hit the right track ...\\"  Asks and tries to answer the question about how, why, when, and where the relationship went wrong.<br /><br />It's All Your Fault (3 out of 5):  It's the kind of track you'll be hearing playing in the background of a Spencer's Gift store for the next six months and always wonder what that's all about.

B001AIRUOU|5.0|. . . that this is one of the finest animated films of all time. Now do I have to say that this contains some of Danny Elfman's most fantastic music. This is absolutely incredible. The stop-motion animation featured here is so much better than the crappy CGI animation found in \\"Chicken Little,\\" \\"Kung Fu Panda,\\" etc. The songs are quite catchy, and I find myself humming them after I see the movie, and listen to the soundtrack. The character designs are spectacular and purely Burtonesque (even though Burton didn't direct this film). It's a fantastic movie, and it first both Halloween and Christmas respectively.<br /><br />Grade: A+
B000NDI3SK|5.0|Jacob Bronowski, unusually for an academic, performs admirably as a television presenter.  He is charming, persuasive, and intimate as he conveys the gradual forward-march of scientific understanding from pre-history through to his own period at the end of the sixth decade of the twentieth century.  He handles complex subjects and trains of events by reducing them to their essentials without undue simplification, and he shows how social factors have so often influenced the development (or conversely the stultification) of science.  He conjures up moments in time, important personages, and vital ideas with a few well-chosen words and he is gently passionate in his art of persuasion.  For anyone wanting an encapsulation of scientific thought since Euclid, this series is worth every penny for that alone.<br /><br />Yet it is more.  Bronowski is above all else a humanist, deeply concerned about the way in which knowledge liberates mankind from suspicion, error, and confusion.  In his personal view, the ascent of man is an ascent from ignorance towards understanding, and from actions ruled by dogma and fear to actions guided by reason and tolerance.  This is an idealist's series of programs aimed above all else at encouraging the viewer to consider life more carefully and in consequence act more thoughtfully.<br /><br />As such, of course, it can aspire but perhaps not succeed.  One of the most revealing moments in the series is when Bronowski talks about evolutionary theory being completely accepted and no longer argued over.  He could make that statement in 1971 but in 2008 it is untrue.  In the opening of the 1970s Bronowski was worried about the post-hippy tendency towards vague mysticism and escapist fantasy.  Some forty years on, the world is a much worse place for humanists than he could ever have imagined.  The intellectual life of the USA has been addled by bigoted mythologists and Islam has become a pejorative term through association with barbaric terrorism.  Academic discourse in the west has long since been hijacked by irrelevant idealogues preaching illiterate nonsense and the rest of the world lacks almost entirely any domain in which thought may run free.  Clearly the ascent of man is far from being a linear process and it is entirely possible that our dazzling inventions will ultimately be the cause of our demise as a species.  We have mastered the art of fire, but we have not acquired the cast of mind necessary to use it wisely.<br /><br />From a technical perspective there are several irritations: far too many sequences of pictures with awful music, really bad artwork and worse ties, poor sound quality and grainy video quality.  But ultimately none of that matters.  We do not disparage Thucydides' writings on the Peloponnesian War because the parchments on which they were transmitted are now yellowed and cracked with age.  We do not dicount Newton's masterful account of a clockwork universe because his handwriting was awkward and his terminology somewhat obscure.  And so the technical imperfections and stylistic infelicities of this series should not interpose themselves between us and our deep appreciation of this unique work.  It is sadly quite unimaginable that any equivalent set of programs could be made today.  Our age is darker than Bronowski's time and so we shall not see its successor.se in the west has long since been hijacked by irrelevant idealogues preaching illiterate nonsense and the rest of the world lacks almost entirely any domain in which thought may run free.

B00140PK6O|5.0|I became acquainted with Elizabeth Gaskell a couple of years ago. She was a contemporary of Charles Dickens.  I really like the characters in all her books and the way she develops them.  This movie is very heart warming and entertaining. Masterpiece Theater did a good job recreating this story.
B001DHXT20|5.0|I waited until now to watch the new Hulk movie.  Figgered a remake so soon after the last Hulk movie would be as close to straight to video as one could get.  However, the idea of Ed Norton playing half the lead character intrigued me.  I consider him one of the best actors of this generation - always convincing without overpowering his roles.    I am certainly glad I did watch this film. The pace was perfect - I loved rooting for the Hulk and despising the General.  My favorite part of the movie was its plug for the old show and especially seeing Lou Ferrigno treated with such respect.  For that alone it would get the five stars, but then they threw in a few more twists that just cracked me up.  A \\"stark\\" contrast from the seriousness of the previous movie!    So, over a hundred something reviews here... I am just adding my two cents and thoughts that this is a movie that you will enjoy watching, even with the kids!    I highly recommend!    All the best,    Jay
B0018S6YO4|2.0|.....the US-version of this Rihanna latest outing doesn't have the song \\"Cry\\"(UK exclusive bonus track...WTF? How about her fans in the US and also from around the globe?). Another evil marketing ploy played by the people in the music industry who are milking her success while she's on heavy rotation around the world.<br /> \\"Reloaded\\", \\"Special Extended Version\\", etc. It seems useless buying the first pressed cds. Because after a very SHORT while, the greedy music company will released...ooops, re-released the cd as a spanky new cd with 1 or 2 worthless track. No wonder the music industry is dying. No offence,<br />but i am truly tired of repackaged cd, tour-version cd and all these rubbish. Sighs.
0061438294|5.0|This book gives the reader a fascinating insight to reading body language. Joe Navarro obviously is a credible source and writes in an easily understandable manner. I highly recommend this book to anyone, whether you use body language in your job or just for general knowledge.
B000002GQG|3.0|This is apparently part of a retrospective package of the seven albums up to \\"Seventh Sojourn.\\"  The back art of the CD case has the track listings over a \\"MB\\" logo instead of the album back, and any liner notes are replaced by segments of an interview with the band about the making of the album.  Well, it's not like you need a lyrics sheet to follow a Moodies song, anyway.  Just so you know it's not a direct replacement of your old record.
B00104JONO|3.0|\\"High School Musical 3: Senior Year\\" is the only film in the series to have been theatrically released. I honestly don't know whether or not this was a good idea. While a big screen and an even bigger budget gave director/co-choreographer Kenny Ortega licenses he didn't have with the first two Disney Channel films, they still didn't allow the story to become anything other than a teen dance extravaganza with a bubblegum pop soundtrack. Then again, it's silly to assume that it actually wanted to be something more; \\"Senior Year\\" remains true to everything that made the first two films such a success, and it does so with no apologies to the people it was obviously not made for, like me. It may be airy, simplistic, innocent, and hopelessly naïve, but it's also harmless, so I see no reason why the fan base shouldn't be allowed to just go and have a good time.    \\"Senior Year\\" essentially follows the same squeaky-clean plot of the first two films, focusing on the twelfth-grade students of East High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) is still the captain of his Basketball team, the Wildcats, and just like before, he finds himself torn between the game and musical theater. His girlfriend is still Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens), the math genius who also loves to sing and dance. Their relationship will once again be tested, especially since they have two different colleges in mind. His best friend, Chad Danforth (Corbin Bleu), is still the jock he always was, and he plans on going to the same college as Troy on a Basketball scholarship. The rich, spoiled drama queen Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) is still scheming her schemes, devising ways to eliminate the competition from this year's musical production. She still has her brother, Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), on a very short leash. I don't know why writer Peter Barsocchini wanted these characters to be related; I find the idea of a brother and sister being so close is a little creepy.    I suppose I should criticize this movie for telling the exact same story over again. On the other hand, audiences tolerated the Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland backyard musicals, the plots of which are summed up with the immortal line, \\"Let's rent the old barn and put on a show!\\" These words, incidentally, are surprisingly apt for any \\"High School Musical\\" film; a barn has never been involved, but a theater stage certainly has. So has a Basketball court, which, when you stop and think about it, is pretty much the same thing as a stage. Whether they're shooting hoops or singing songs, it's all about performing with these students.    The inflated budget for the third movie is most evident during three musical numbers. The first one shows Sharpay and Ryan fantasizing about being Broadway superstars, and it features glitzy sets, colorful costumes, dramatic lighting, and a multitude of dancers. The second one shows Troy and Chad in an automobile junkyard. As soon as they begin dancing, mechanics come out of the woodwork and join in. That scene also features a stripped car with a hood that opens and closes in time with the song. The third one shows a confused, frustrated Troy wandering the school halls after hours. One key shot tips its hat to \\"Royal Wedding,\\" specifically the scene in which Fred Astaire dances across the floor, walls, and ceiling of a furnished room (achieved by a rotating set). They're displays of theatrical opulence, all of which were noticeably absent from the previous \\"High School Musical\\" films. It even spills into the school's new musical production, which looks and sounds more expensive than most high schools--or even colleges--can probably afford.    The problems stem from the fact that lavish song and dance numbers don't go hand in hand with songs so adolescent, so contrived, so musically derivative that they all seem to come off of an assembly line. Do kids really enjoy music like that? My personal tastes in musicals were formed at age three, when I first sawFrank Oz's remake of \\"Little Shop of Horrors.\\" That film introduced me to Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, the talented songwriting duo who would later rejuvenate Walt Disney Pictures with wonderful contributions to \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"Aladdin.\\" They understood that even films geared towards younger audiences deserved stirring, memorable musical numbers. This is more than I can say for the \\"High School Musical\\" films, all of which feature bland, lifeless songs written by anonymous people.    But wait a minute--I seem to be forgetting that artists like Hannah Montana and Hilary Duff and the Jonas Brothers have made it big in the world of bubblegum pop. Movies like \\"High School Musical 3\\" are perfectly suited for devotees of that particular genre. Can I really blame a film for achieving exactly what it wanted to achieve? Should I look down on a preteen fantasy simply for giving the fans what they asked for? It all inevitably come down to a rating, which in this case has to reflect two things: (1) this movie will satisfy the young adult crowd, especially if they loved the first two \\"High School Musicals\\"; (2) this movie is not meant for older audiences, who will probably not be able to tolerate puppy-love romances, sterile and repetitive plots, stick-figure caricatures, and manufactured music. I'll split the difference with three stars. That should be enough of a guideline for those who could go either way.
0375826726|5.0|Brisingr has been a joy to read since I first cracked it open.  I find it quicker paced than the second entry in the series and I almost have to pull myself away from it after I've been reading for a couple of hours.  Don't let the number of pages fool you.  If you like the series or the fantasy genre in general you'll read through the book quickly!
B001DU8T6S|4.0|I think as an album it's a 4, but as a Queen album it's a 3. Good for Paul Rodgers, but he's no Freddie Mercury.
B001F2W4Y2|3.0|There is 1 track on this album that made me have to hear again that I couldn't get out of my head, and it was \\"Anything Goes\\". Overall, though the album was kind of bland and repetative and I can't put my fingr on why exactly. To me it has that sound of the last 2 albums...and it doesn't exactly sound like AC/DC. Only true fans will detect this, it is kind of a bassy, muddled sound to the instruments. Don't get me wrong everything is crystal clear but it sounds \\"processed\\" or something. The guitars don't have a grating edginess to them anymore.<br />As for the tunes, themselves, I read again and again how they got back to the AC/DC of old and how they got away from the catchy hooks which they've brought back for this album. Maybe part of it is that I heard again and again it may be their best album ever, or at least since Back in Black. Right now \\"SMash n' Grab\\" is on and it is growing on me with a very cool chorus and awesome bass line, but again, I don't have an urge to repeat the song instantly.<br />Overall, it is solid, there are only 2 really poor songs on here \\"Stormy Mayday\\" 2 stars and \\"Black Ice\\" 2 stars, there is one song I would rate as 5, several as 4 and the rest 3. I rate each song and divide by 15 and get a 3.3 out of 5 for 66.6%...huh, fitting, really!
B000V6BE6C|4.0|Reading the other reviews and hearing opinions from other A7X fans, it seems like new fans really enjoy this album, while the old fans are disappointed. If your an old fan, expect a different and somewhat (or really) disappointing and lack-luster album from A7X. I'll commend the band on experimentation and reaching into different stuff, but their self-titled fails to bring the intensity and incredible metal sound A7X has brought on previous works. Honestly, had i heard the songs before buying the album, i would've passed. For new fans, buy Waking the Fallen to listen to A7X at their best.     Hopefully the next album will make up for this...
B000007491|1.0|I'm a big Supertramp fan and I have been for years. I have just about every album from Crime of the Century onward (well, I drew the line after Free as a Bird). However, for some reason, I did not have this particular album so I went ahead I bought it. Well, now I know why I did not have it. It's because this album has nothing to do with the Supertramp band we know (and love). Honestly? If you want Supertramp-like albums, I recommend Roger Hodgson's solo efforts. If you think you'll have another Supertramp album, you will be disappointed big time. The sound is as far as it can be from the \\"classic\\" Supertramp sound. The songs are melodically weak and boring (although they were written by Hodgson). No catchy tunes here. So, unless you are dying to spend some money and don't know where to, I'd not get close to this album.
B001EZ78T6|3.0|John Legend does Evolve in this album, but I don't think into something I like.<br />Hearing this album not just as fun as two previous ones.<br />But I'm still a fan, anyway.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|I've never been a james bond fan but my husband is.  I bought him this because it was the only one he didn't have.  He usually watches them when I'm not around.  I watched this one with him & I was pleasantly surprised.  I liked it.  It actually had a love story to it with a tragic ending, who knew.  I would recommend it to even people who were'nt fans before this to give it a try, you'll be surprised too!
B00005JKJA|5.0|I've given up trying 2 figure out why this and why that.  I just sit back and enjoy the ride.  It's mystical never practical, illogical always maniacal.  The performances are brilliant.  This is Naomi Watts crowning achievement.  One of m' fave films!
B0001HLVS2|5.0|First time I watched this I wasen't crazy about it I was distracted thru the whole movie with company at our house. Then I watched it by myself & have been hooked on it ever since, glad I gave it a second chance because now it's one of my favorites of all times for movies!
B000YAA68C|4.0|We are pleased with this purchase, the vacuum is easy to use, efficient and quiet.  Only problem is that the cord will not stay out (always in the rewind mode).  Since the machine has a 2 year warranty this is only a slight problem and while we wait for the new rewind mechanism a clothspin works just fine!
B001F12J3Y|4.0|Well, it appears that this will be the first review of the Blu-ray, 3-D version of this movie on Amazon...I'm honored! I won't waste your time with yet another boring opinion of the story or characters themselves, as there are already hundreds of those on here for you to spend all day reading!  Along those lines, I will ONLY say that I personally love this movie and honestly believe it's the best, most realistic, and heartfelt use of animation technology that I've ever seen.  I'm over 50 and have seen most all of them by now.      ANYWAY, I am ONLY going to comment on my take of the 3-D video quality here, and leave the (great) audio quality to others, as my curiosity regarding the 3-D feature was why I upgraded from my perfectly good HD DVD copy.  I bought this edition yesterday (on release date) and watched the whole movie in 3-D last night, on our 60-inch Sony HD, 1080i, rear projection screen.  I put the supplied blue and red cardboard glasses over my regular eyeglasses.  Not super-comfortable, if you have an adult-sized head and need to wear normal eyeglasses.  You'll eventually get all of your eyewear lined up...what else could you do?!!  (I think you can buy sturdier, more comfortable ones online somewhere).     HERE IS THE GOOD:  I don't have much to compare this to (perhaps others do), except something I'll mention later, but YES, I was blown away by the almost constant use of the 3-D technology.  Snow seemed to be falling all over my home theater room (sometimes turning the whole room into a snow globe, if you catch my \\"drift\\"...pun intended!!...sorry, I couldn't resist!)  Other objects, food, and hot chocolate flew or bounced around the train cars and past my head, front to rear!!  Just about everything, even when subtle, seemed to pop off (or extend in front of) the screen!  I think our 60-inch, large screen added to the desired effect, since I imagine that life-sized people and objects will seem more real, coming at or past you.  I don't think a much smaller screen would create quite as much of a dramatic effect, but I'd be curious to hear about that...maybe everything is proportionately equal that way?  So, the 3-D is very cool!  As I mentioned earlier, the only better 3-D effect I've ever seen (and I've never seen IMAX), was at Disney World (about 20 years ago!), when they were showing some sort of Michael Jackson island adventure short (\\"Captain...something or other!!\\"), made especially for that venue.  That one was absolutely AMAZING, when creatures actually \\"flew\\" off the screen and \\"perched\\" on top of nearby audience seats, then flew around the audience, taunting everybody!...No, I wasn't drinking!!!  And swords, knives, or spears were thrown at the audience from the screen, as well!  It was really a bit scary, actually, and I wasn't a little kid then either!  And just think, that was all those years ago, technologically speaking.  Who knows what can truly be done today?    ANYWAY, HERE IS THE BAD:  Even on Blu-ray (and I wouldn't suggest that you even bother with the standard def 3-D version because of this), you will lose about HALF of the clarity and I'd say about 2/3 of the color, compared with the 2-D version.  Everything looks almost, but not quite, Black & White, with a metallic-looking tint effect that often matches the colors on the supplied lenses.  Also, it even tells you somewhere to turn up your brighness and/or \\"vivid\\" setting on your screen, because the picture is noticeably DARKER than the regular version.  This gives an interesting eerie effect, but not really what most viewers (and their kids) would probably expect or want.      When you combine the drawbacks with the somewhat uncomfortable glasses (despite the \\"cool\\" Fifties-style fashion look!!!), I think you'll agree with my BOTTOM LINE CONCLUSION:  It's a must-see for people who love this movie, as I do, just to experience it if nothing else.  BUT...my future viewings will mostly be in 2-D, with the beautiful Blu-ray picture quality, with its usual clarity, color, brightness, etc.  It will of course be a great \\"Demo Disc\\" to show off your system (again, preferably with a large screen if you want it to look real wintery in your house!!).      ALL IN ALL...a good addtion to your Blu-ray collection and a GREAT CONVERSATION PIECE!!!  PS:  My wife loved it, and she isn't the technology addict that I can sometimes be!  I hope this helps...Enjoy!
B00006ADD5|5.0|Cinematography makes this film great.  I loved one of the first scenes in which Lawrence and his guide are dipping water from a well and see a shifting, ephemeral shape in the distance.  The shape gets larger and seems to be someone walking on water...or...at leasts someone walking on the surface of a shimmering mirage.  A rifle cracks and the guide drops dead.  The 'shape' is Omar Sharif on his camel and has killed the guide for the unforgiveable sin of stealing water.<br /><br />The movie is filled with similar images of the desert...beautiful, deadly and brutal.  Lawrence, in the form of the overly-tall Peter O'Toole [the real T.E. Lawrence was only about 5' 4\\"].  Still, O'Toole captures some of the strangeness and irony of a very strange Englishman.  Lawrence girds up the Bedoins to fight the Ottoman Turks.  They blow up trains and murder people.  They traverse an uncrossable desert to attack Al Aqaba on the Gulf with guns trained only on the sea.  After incredible hardship they succeed and slaughter the garrison.  Lawrence finds an interesting truth about himself...he enjoys killing people.<br /><br />Confusion about his very nature moves Lawrence in his leadership of the Arab cause.  Lawrence's leadership has, in its own way, become much our own problem in dealing with the Arabic and Islamic powers.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico
B001DU8T6S|4.0|This album is bloody fantastic.  This is not a Queen album.  This is not a Paul Rodgers solo album.  This is an album by Queen + Paul Rodgers.  That means it's not an album that is going to sound or be entirely like a `classic' Queen album, or an album that is a Bad Company knock-off.  From their inception, the group has made it crystal clear it is not going to try and be something it ain't, or replace something that can't be replaced. So with that in mind, this is brand new classic rock n' roll with touches of that classic Queen flair, and steeped deep with Rodgers blue-eyed soul. The real star on this album is Brian May.  His guitar playing drives this album from beginning to end, with his instantly recognizable solos, and his sweet guitar tone is a breath of fresh air throughout.  Any guitar rock fan will appreciate Brian's playing as his stamp is all over this.  That is not to say that Paul and Rogers are left in his dust, Paul sounds terrific as always, an ageless wonder on the microphone, hard to believe he started singing 40 years ago with Free, his voice is still a gift to behold and listen to.  Roger's main strengths on this album are his songwriting contributions and the choral harmonies. 2 of his songs (which he primarily wrote) C-Lebrity and Surf's Up...School's Out are quirky numbers and it's a thrill to hear Paul singing them, he sounds up for the challenge and it's musically something thats not in Paul's comfort zone. 2 of the biggest surprises for me on this album are the 2 tracks I had already heard.  Say It's Not True from the live album 2 years ago, I was initially not turned on by it, but since it's now recorded properly, it's an amazing track, and with Paul sharing the lead vocals at the end just adds so much more dynamics and is a real winner.  The other, Warboys, was from Paul's live album last year, again not impressed initially, but now with the entire band at work, it's excellent.  A nice driving tune that kicks, and, is special for all thetroops at war overseas.  Elsewhere, the Queen-style numbers Cosmos Rockin' and We Believe could have been 80's Queen numbers and would have fit Freddie's style nicely.  All-in-all an excellent, 4-star debut studio album from Queen + Paul Rodgers.   A pleasant surprise and my expectations were blown away.
6305736650|4.0|It seems I have received a number of negative reviews on my interpretation of this film which is somewhat baffling to me.  In fact I think 'Casablanca' is an excellent film but think its quality--and the quality is indeed superb--is largely a product of editing rather than initial planning.  Surely the actors didn't think that they were involved in anything 'special'.  They thought it was just another studio film being cranked out like tanks or aircraft during WWII.<br /><br />This film was, I believe, released in 1945. Therefore, it is, in some ways, a fairly standard propaganda flick [and there were hundreds of them during the War] saved by the presence of Ingrid Bergman, in all her youthful beauty, and the brooding 'Rick' [Humphrey Bogart].  Bergman's beauty is a thing to behold and Bogart's agony is correspondingly miserable.<br /><br />Rick's 'Club Americain' is in Vichy-French controlled Casa Blanca.  It is also a hot bed for intrigue and desperate people trying to escape Nazi occupied Europe. Rick, who is a successful restrauteur, has settled into an alcoholic haze following his baffling abandonment by the haunting Bergman in Paris a couple of years earlier.  Much to Rick's chagrin and surprise, Bergman shows up unexpectedly--along with her husband--in his North African night club.  Rick immediately sinks into a desperate, alcohol enhanced grief as he waits for Bergman to return and explain herself.  Rick's despair is truly a thing to behold and is why Bogart deserves to be rated as one of the truly great actors.<br /><br />Paul Henreid, as Bergman's cuckolded husband, is just too noble for words and the Nazis are appropriately unidimensional and evil.  The cynical Vichy French Inspector is indeed perfect as a man who ultimately finds where his loyalties...and soul...lies.  \\"Arrest the usual suspects,\\" he orders, as Bogart, walking away with him in the fog tells him, \\"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\\"  Excellent stuff, really.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Conquest of Mexicoels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Conquest of Mexico
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Putting two great filmmakers together leads to a great movie. The story kind of doesn't really matter but the action and the point that the movie wants to get across are both well directed. Also this must be Josh Hartnett's best performance, and good performances from all involved.
B001F2W4Y2|2.0|I consider myself a pretty big ACDC fan.  They're not my favorite band, but I do like about a hundred songs by them, including the ones I like from this one, but I don't like every song.  I think Back in black is the only album I like in its entirety, though I do really like Razor's Edge, High voltage, Powerrage, and Flick of the switch.  That all being said I can't say excitement was what I felt when I heard that ACDC would be coming out with a new album.  Stiff upper lip had some great stand out songs, but the rest of the album was very slow and kinda boring, and don't get me started on the lame ballbreaker, but being the fan, and music collecter I am I had to hear it.    As others have said, Brian Johnson's voice is great on here.  There's even a song he kind of sings in part of, well sort of.  He uses a little more diversity than I've heard from him, and that's the only real highlight of this album.  There are some cool guitar parts, The riff in Stormy May day comes to mind, but there aren't any songs that I love.  I enjoy more than half of the album, and it is growing on me, but there arent any personal classics on here.  I think ballbreaker was the only other ACDC album to not have any songs I loved, at least this one has some decent songs.  If you're an ACDC fanatic, then don't hesitate to get this.  If you're not then I'd suggest listening to it first and deciding for yourself.  Some favorite songs are Rock n roll train, Big jack, Wheels-one of my favorites on the album, and Spoilin' For A Fight.
B000O599WG|5.0|In todays hustle and bustle world, it's nice to occasionally relax and watch an old fashioned western with real \\"good guys\\".

0099450259|3.0|I am obliged to express my heartfelt appreciation to the author who had written a very unique book that readers could go through a detective story from the eyes/mind of a 15 year old boy with Asperger's Syndrome. I now feel much more for the difficulties facing such patients and have learnt the Monty Hall Problem (and some other mathematical puzzles, too). However, the story or the writing (limited by the character) is not interesting nor complicated to a middle aged man like me. Perhaps the author had targeted at the relatively sophisticated youngsters. Then there was too much foul language indeed.
B001E7OO2I|3.0|I have always been a fan of John Legend even before he was Legend, it was John Stephens but I am not excited about this CD.  As he mentioned in the beginning of the Amazon video when he creates a new project he does not know what the sound will be and it shows on this project.  This is to POP sounding and missing the raw passion and the jamming sounds which I love about his music.  I will always follow his career but this Evolved into nothing for me.  Sorry John.
0316166685|2.0|*A bit spoilery...I did like that Alice Sebold used an Observing First Person point of view, since I don't come across it very often and the language and descriptions were excellent. The opening of The Lovely Bones was gripping, perhaps too gripping, with the detail of the rape and murder of a child, but the rest of the book failed to deliver its promise.<br /><br />We're all observers of the world that's been ripped away from fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon, as it picks up ten years after her death. We're told about her heaven, don't experience it. We're given peepholes and voyeur passes to witness the unraveled mess her family has become. We see the killer, still uncaught. Her mother having an affair with the lead detective. Her sister finding love and having sex, living the life that was stolen from her. Her old friends, first kiss. Her father still grieving and trying to ensnare the man he knows killed his daughter.<br /><br />Susie's lighthearted tone creates vastness and keeps readers from experiencing much beyond the first couple chapters. Because of this distance, readers are left with a cruddy middle, an irritating ending and an emptiness for things left unresolved. We're never allowed to connect with any of the characters because Susie doesn't.<br /><br />For most of this book, Susie gets us to hope that someone would find proof of her murder or her bones. Yet when she gets the chance to go back to earth briefly, instead of giving anyone a head's up, she possesses the body of a childhood lesbian friend, basically raping her by seducing the only boy she kissed without her friend's consent or knowledge. One rape is portrayed as horrible, and the other was sold as the feel-good climax, no pun intended, but it was icky, wrong and strange for so many reasons. And what about the aftermath now of poor Ruth, whom she inhabited and used? No one seems to care about her. Seeing true vindication and closure for Susie's murder is the main reason why I continued reading through 2/3rd's-worth of pretty sludge.<br /><br />I wanted to like this book, but I didn't find much originality here. The characters are archetypal. We never really get a good grasp on them or Susie. There's no more depth beyond what's already on the back of the book. The sparsity and observing device is akin to Our Town, the creepy possessed sex scene is right out of Ghost, but more gross and disturbing since it's a fourteen-year-old with a man, and this kind of trap-door ending was used in The Bad Seed. The author adeptly cast a whimsical haze over gritty material, which is to be lauded, but it should have delved deeper, so we could weep for the life that was stolen, the family shattered, the mystery unsolved. As is, I feel cheated.pretty sludge.    I wanted to like this book, but I didn't find much originality here. The characters are archetypal. We never really get a good grasp on them or Susie.

B000002HJR|5.0|NOLA is simply an outstanding, heavy, southern rock album. Nothing to say that hasn't been said in other reviews, just a fantastic album from start to finish. This album is only second to seeing Down live. They put on a show that'll drop your jaw, and you haven't lived until you heard a hard and heavy live version of Bury Me In Smoke.
B000002GKT|5.0|Ranks with the best live rock albums of all time, for sure. They were great, and the time in which they performed allowed for this sort of greatness. Everything you need to know about the direction of rock beyond 1973 is contained in the fact that Frampton left this lot to become an ice-cream-pants-wearing teen idol singing songs like \\"Baby I Love Your Way.\\" Yes, he made a lot more money and got a lot more of everything that comes with it, and I actually like some of what he did by hisself, but Humble Pie was a better band. There is so much soul in this playing, especially Mr. Marriott. They just get out there and testify, it's the real thing, none of this pretend crap. I find myself wishing there was more recorded material out there from these shows. I can't believe this is all there was that was worth a listen.

B000069KGM|5.0|Listen to this and you will understand how powerfully creative rock music was in its true heyday. Anything was possible, and this record is one of the best examples of the combination of artistry, musicianship and, of course, commercial potential. Unfortunately the latter ultimately was pursued to its fullest by this group, but that says as much about the changing landscape as it does about the direction they took. Here -- and in subsequent albums up to \\"Live at Carnegie Hall\\" -- they went for it lock, stock and the smoking axe of one Terry Kath. Three lead singers, a bunch of virtuoso players, a great band. And the drummer was a monster, always a prerequisite.
0375826726|5.0|Brisingr is charged with imaginative energy and compelling characters that come alive in this grand adventure. Relaxing in my favorite reading chair in the evening with Brisingr; I can easily hear the mighty roar of Eragon's dragon Saphira during an engaging battle. And feel the intimate connection they share with one another in a powerful bond of love.     The first book, Eragon, literally fell into my hands by chance while I was browsing along a shelf of books in a local book store and it fell off the shelf so that I had to react quickly and catch it. Curious, I took it home and by the time I finished reading the first chapter I was hooked and have remained hooked through Eldest, and now Brigingr. The story of Eragon, and all of the other characters who come into the orbit of his hero's journey, is cleanly told with descriptive language that uplifts one's spirit from the workaday world on our daily life and puts a smile in your heart.     For me: Brisingr flows naturally as an extension of the preceding books in this adventure story. Paolini has crafted a fun read for anyone lucky enough to find these books. No matter what age you are, I recommend that you come to this exciting fantasy story with the innocent spirit and the open mind of your own youthful inner hero where magic can still live in your world. Nay sayers are a dime a dozen. Sweep those aside and give yourself a treat with this book. I give a big YES to Brisingr and indeed to the complete series. I eagerly await the next book.

Gushers and gushers of blood.<br /><br />I'm joking, of course.<br /><br />I think the fact that a picture whose \\"hero\\" is a serial killer and involves cannibalism was released into theaters on Christmas week 2007 is rather ludicrous.  Certainly Halloween would have been more appropriate.  But, that's a discussion for another day.<br /><br />Directed by Tim Burton in a dark style reminiscent of his equally excellent SLEEPY HOLLOW, SWEENEY  TODD features a bleak, almost colorless production design in the film that is absolutely mesmerizing.  Indeed, as previously stated, the only prominent color is red.<br /><br />The movie won the Academy Award for its Art Direction.<br /><br />Johnny Depp and Helen Bonham Carter are superb in the two leading roles, and Stephen Sondhiem's music and lyrics are extremely clever, particularly \\"A Little Priest,\\" Johanna\\" and \\"Pretty Women\\".<br /><br />The plot, set in London during the early 19th-century, finds barber Sweeney Todd (Depp) returning from prison and exile to seek revenge on the corrupt judge (Alan Rickman) who framed him so that he could steal his wife.  Todd is helped by Mrs. Lovett (Carter), who owns a bake shop and makes \\"the worst pies in London\\".<br /><br />While awaiting an opportunity give the judge a very  \\"close shave,\\" Todd and Mrs. Lovett devise a plan whereby he will slice the throats of his unsuspecting customers and she will turn their bodies into meat pies.<br /><br />Timothy Spall and Sacha Baron Cohen are fine in two of the movie's key villainous  roles, as is Ed Sanders, the boy who plays \\"Toby\\".  He is a terrific performer.<br /><br />Also in the cast are Jamie Campbell Bower, Jayne Wisener and Laura Michelle Kelly.<br /><br />SWEENEY TODD is not for the faint of heart, but it is a brilliantly executed picture that deserves all the accolades that it received.<br /><br />The 2-disc \\"Special Edition\\" DVD from DreamWorks Home Entertainment has many \\"Making of\\" and \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurettes that focus on the various aspects of the production, plus a documentary on the \\"Real History of Sweeney Todd\\" and the origins of the stage musical.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|Pink has been consistantly raising the bar for herself. Her debut album, while good in its own right, obviously was not an accurate reflection of the artist she really wanted to be. Upon the release of her second album, more of her gritty style came to light and revealed that she was much more fun than the simple confines of R&B and pop allowed her to be. In many instances, she was quite rocking. She experienced a minor setback with Try This! which must have been to drastic a change for the fan base because her sales were poor. (The album however is an axcellent one...)  I'm Not Dead was my favorite album she has released because it was chock full of fun, catchy, and in your face tracks... and while it is still my favorite, her new album Funhouse, it by far a better album.  Creatively, she ventures into newer terraign. She tries on the blues for size and gets down with her folksy self... continuing the direction the song \\"Dear Mr. President\\" started. She continues to be more in-your-face yet also remains slightly subdued. She's reigned in the tongue-in-cheek lyrics just a bit and is exploring deeper meanings. The song \\"Sober\\" is one of my favorite because of its reflective meaning and Pink's emotive crooning. She does not have the voice of an angel but her voice is beautiful none-the-less. Of course, the lead single rocks. I really enjoy \\"Funhouse\\" because it is a decent break up song... set to a beat that can lift anyone out of the dumps. \\"Bad Influence\\" is catchy and upbeat... and a tad reminicent of \\"Cuz I Can\\" from \\"I'm Not Dead\\". I really enjoyed \\"One Foot Wrong\\" because I can directly relate to it. But I was quite pleased with how this album ended... \\"Glitter in the Air\\" is a soft yet relevant song... and it serves to make you think.  I can sort of see why the album is called Funhouse... but at the same time I'm a little perplexed because this album seems to be shorter on the fun and heavier on the emotion... which I like. Perhaps... it is a funhouse in the vain of a rollercoaster...

1416594884|4.0|While plot is not irrelevant in Le Carre's novels, one reads them for the look and feel of the clandestine world: operatives, agencies, and techniques, as well as the psychology and philosophy of it all. Set in Hamburg, Germany, in a post-9/11 atmosphere, this book looks at the near obsession of competing agencies to find and thwart terrorists, where insubstantial evidence is hardly seen as an obstacle to action.<br /><br />Others have mentioned the main characters: Issa, a traumatized Islamic Chechen; Annabel, his idealistic German lawyer; Tommy Brue, a remorseful banker; and Gunther Bachmann, a cautionary veteran of the spy wars, but now in a battle with those in a simplistic rush to judgment. Through lengthy dialogs and their musings, these characters and their dilemmas come to life.<br /><br />However, in many ways, the characters seem to be in an inexorable drama in which they are helpless to moderate the mandate of national intelligence agencies to seek and destroy terrorists. Also, the author lets the attractions of Issa and Tommy to Annabel simply fizzle out.<br /><br />While the author is obviously a supreme craftsman in this genre, the book is not entirely satisfying. The vagueness of Issa's background (is he a terrorist or victim) and his claims to a fortune with Brue's bank hangs over the book. Perhaps it is realistic, but the helplessness of those trying to operate in a reasoned, practical manner is not appealing. The lengthy meetings and the various machinations of the agencies do become a bit tedious and even a little confusing. Le Carre fans will undoubtedly be happy to have another offering regardless of where it stands among all of his work.
B001DWNUCO|4.0|This is a movie about caligula which meant little boots in latin.<br />He was the son of the great prince and general Germanicus and he was Romes third emporer.  He started out ok and then began to push the boundries into the realm of either insanity or just selfish evil.  His life was [...] , you can't tell about Caligula unless you tell about how he made the wives of senators into whores.  He was driven to sexual excesses that were shocking to the Romans.  His cruelty was legendary and finally they assassinated him.  This movie depicts him in all his monstrous excesses. And it does a great job doing it too.  Malcolm Mcdowell really portrays the essence of the man. Was he insane? or was he the ultimate spoiled young man who is allowed to do whatever he wanted?  Did he actually believe that he was a god or did he just want to get away with anything he could?  An interesting fact is that he was killed as he attempted to put his statue on the Temple Mount in Jerusalum.  This was seen as a act of god. And perhaps he should be in the bible as a lesson that NO man shall become a god. after all he was contemporary with peter, paul and the other biblical figures.  Sure the movie has lots of sex in it but it still tells one of histories most bizaare stories ,ok, the bad news is that they did not remaster this movie, there are terrible  defects in the print. There was no excuse for not removing lines from it. unfortunately this movie has been hacked to pieces in the past so they made this version from what remains. A better version of this on blu ray  cleaned up and color restored is needed. The colors look faded, and like 'black christmas' and many others no attempt has been made to restore color,<br /> BUT, this blu ray version is the best you are going to get probably for a long time if not forever sadly.  It looks better on blu ray than it did on dvd but this still needs work just like other flicks that were not cleaned up. However will they ever do it? so if you want this movie you want the blu ray version it's the best one so far.you want the blu ray version it's the best one so far.
B0017M8XS6|4.0|Today was my first listen of the SACD version of Brain Salad Surgery.  There are two other discs included with this edition, neither of which are of interest to me.  I also own the DVD-Audio version.    Why it gets 4 stars.  It sounds as good, perhaps a tiny bit better than the dvd-audio version.  Hard for me to do A-B comparisons with any accuracy, but I do have a solid system anchored by a denon DVD-3910, and the SACD is high quality.  Really depends on your player and which format sounds better on it.  If you do not have the dvd-audio version than this is a no brainer.    Why not 5 stars then?  Well, because I was hoping for better dynamics on the first Karn Evil track (that always sounded a little flat to me on the DVD-Audio) and there is not much if any improvement there.  Also, there is no bonus Lucky Man track on the SACD, which sounds quite good on the dvd-audio version.  If you have the DVD-Audio verson, probably no need to get this one.  If not, pick the SACD up for $25 or so from one of the venders here, and avoid paying the rediculous amount that the DVD-Audio version is going for.

Great cd that I would give more than 5 stars to if possible.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|Audrey Hepburn had a lot of memorable, glamorous roles as highly individual, sensitive young women.<br /><br />But her most iconic turn was as Holly Golightly, a frivolous young woman with a highly sensitive core. Hepburn is a ball of shimmering charm here, whether she's setting hats on fire or chasing nameless cats through the rain, and she's able to shine brightly enough to obscure a few flaws (such as Mickey Rooney). The other actors do serviceable jobs, but she's undeniablythe star.<br /><br />\\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is a daily ritual for Holly Golightly (Hepburn), a social butterfly who hosts parties, entertains drunken men for their fifty-dollartips, and dreams of owning a horse farm in Mexico with her brother. When kept-man Paul Varjak (George Peppard) moves into a neighboring apartment -- courtesy of his rich patroness -- he is instantly enchanted by the ditzy, sweet-natured Holly.<br /><br />But for all Holly's fun, Paul starts to realize that all is not well with her.

B001E7OO2I|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am totally biased, I love John Legend!  He could sing the alphabet and as long as he does so beautifully, I will love it.  I will say that this album is not my favorite one but it is good.  The album is different, just as his second was different from his first one.  This album is not even a mixture of the two: It's Evolution.  John has indeed stepped from behind the piano as Andre 3000 suggests and showed us that he could do something a little more up tempo and do it refreshingly well.      Let's see... the album starts with Green Light, which is his single with Andre.  When I first heard it on the radio I thought it was nice.  Now it's one of my favorite songs to dance to.    It's Over: The song is honest.  John is questioning himself on why he keeps calling her when he knows that it is over.  He openly admits that he doesn't want to be who she wants him to be.  This song features Kanye and that friggin' vocoder machine.  The machine I could have done without but Kanye presents his rhyme in his usual fun witty style. Overall a good track.    Everybody Knows: At first not one of my favorites but an easy listen.  Then John hit one of the most beautiful notes, made me listen, and now it stays on repeat.  The line, \\"I still can't believe you,\\" turned this song around.  Another point of honesty comes when he wishes his best and says \\"I guess\\" followed by a beautifully written hook.  I forget the name of the girl he works with who does his background vocals but together they always sound great.    Quickly: Definitely has an 80's feel to it.  Brandy makes a guest appearance on this track.  Nice.    Cross the Line: I like it.  Another 80's type of beat.  He does his whispering growl (as I call it).  It's enticing.    No Other Love: Another banger for me.  The reggae rhythm makes me sway my hips.  Estelle sounds wonderful.  This Time: John sits back behind the piano and gives us what he does best, a beautiful honest ballad that tells of what he would do different if he could get that one more chance.  I would take a man back if he came to me with this type of honesty.    Satisfaction: Another nice song to groove to.    Take Me Away: Not my favorite but I am sure it will grow on me.    Good Morning:  I heard this on his Green Light video and I wanted more.  John speaks of saying that one last \\"Good Morning\\" in a special way.  Oh what a way to wake up!    I Love, You Love: This song is different.  One of those off beat type of tracks where John just croons and expresses his love.  I like it.  The guitar is really nice on this one.    If You're Out There:  You all know John is good for that one inspirational song.  Sure it's a little cheesy but I get his point.    My favorites: Everybody Knows, This Time, No Other Love, It' Over, and Good Morning    Overall the album is strong.  I wouldn't skip over any song.  But some songs definitely carry more weight than the others.
B00009YOQW|5.0|We got this for my son when he turned 1 and it was an instant hit.  He loves banging on it and it has a really nice tone.  It's taken a lot of abuse over the last six months and has held up really well.  And, unlike a lot of other toys that fail to hold his interest, it's still in heavy rotation.  Highly recommended for any toddler!
031606792X|5.0|I am 26, married, and a mother of three.  I absolutely loved Breaking Dawn.  The story is more about love maturing after committing to marriage and having children.  I think the reason why younger readers could no longer identify with Bella was becasue they have never experienced the unconditional love for a child.  Like the Harry Potter series moving from a children's book to more young adult, the Twilight Saga moves from young adult to adult in Breaking Dawn.  I was very pleased that Bella's human trait of acting older than she is(born 35 and keeps on getting more middle aged), was carried over to her vampire life as her super self control.  I don't think it was really self control, but Bella acting more mature than her physical age.  Regarding the final confrontation at the end, I thought it was satisfying.  Not everything has to end in a physical fight.
B000K4Z9KM|3.0|Boy did I want to love this book.  And on the surface, it's got everything. You take a book with a beautiful, independent young woman, a handsome rogue, an evil step uncle, a gang of cut-throats, a mysterious house at the edge of the moor, crashing waves, stormy nights, and people who are not always what they seem, and you should have one roller coaster of a read.  And considering that this was written by Daphne DuMaurier, who chilled us with The Birds (and if you haven't read the short story, do so...it's not at all like the movie)and hypnotized us with Rebecca, I expected a great deal.  Jamaica Inn just never grabbed me. The story unfolds so slowly, it's painful. When Our Heroine walks the moor, it feels like she's doing it in real time. I also had a hard time not wanting to shake a little sense into this supposedly very sensible young woman. Upon her mother's death, she goes to live with her sprightly, coquettish Aunt, who has recently married. Upon arrival, Our Heroine finds that Auntie's husband is a vicious brute and has turned the poor woman into a stammering, shaking, terrified wreck.  So who does Our Heroine decide to fall in love with? The roguish, undisciplined look alike kid brother of Evil Uncle, who has \\"Future Domestic Abuser\\" written all over him.  Sorry, Ms. DuMaurier. After checking out Jamaica Inn, I wouldn't check in.
1419347004|1.0|Our bookclub selected this for our October gathering.  We were very disappointed with the book and the characters.  There were many opportunities for character development ~ didn't happen.  It required more than 100 pages to get to the first really humorous situation!  And for all her dingbat antics, the heroine still got the job and the millionaire ~ go figure!
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Excellent.   Great idea of special features including a read-along with script below.  Wonderful for early readers.Stupendous to be able to obtain for children all one's childhood favorites in the ORIGINAL, not some politically correct version which insults one's intelligence.
1433502437|3.0|This commentary addresses the binding and leather of the Premium Calfskin edition of the ESV Study Bible ONLY. First of all let me say that I view bibles as lifetime investments and future heirlooms for my children so I always try to buy bibles that will last a very long time. With that mindset I have previously acquired 2 other premium calfskin editions of the ESV, one being the Heirloom Reference Edition and the other is the ESV Classic Reference Edition. I am VERY pleased with the quality of both; as a matter of fact the leather binding on both is the finest I have encountered. So when the ESV Study Bible debuted I ordered the ESV Study Bible in the premium calfskin binding. When my ESV Study Bible arrived however I was disappointed in the unit sent to me. The inner leather lining was delaminating from the inside face of the cover leaf. Furthermore the inner leather lining is thinner than the 2 previous editions and consequently the leather feels a little too flimsy. For such a large and thick bible I wish that they would not have made the leather thinner. It is obvious to me that the quality level of the ESV Study Bible Premium Calfskin edition is not up to par with the previous premium calfskin editions. I immediately sent mine back asking for a replacement and hopefully, I will be pleasantly surprised when it arrives. In the meantime I thought I should post my experience for prospective buyers considering the purchase of the Premium Calfskin edition of the ESV Study Bible.
0060090383|3.0|As I mention in my review of another Keyes work, I read the Sullivan books out of order, and, as a result, may have developed a slightly different sense of the characters. This may have coloured my view of this book.<br /><br />I had two main complaints about this novel. First, to a great extent, the theme has been beaten to death since going into rehab became chic. If Sandra Bullock has made a motion picture about something, it is not new. (Don't get me wrong, I love her, but \\"edgy\\" she is not.)<br /><br />Second, I had a hard time with the choice of character that Keyes sent to rehab. The entire time I read this book, I kept wondering to myself why Keyes didn't send the Anna character to rehab, since every time we see her in the earlier books, the girl is too stoned to function. She loses jobs, wanders off, and forgets to go to class. Then, suddenly, Rachel ends up in rehab for an entire book, and Anna goes clean in a chapter of another book (a seperate issue I cover in my review of Anna's novel). I just never quite got past the idea that Keyes sent the wrong person in; and couldn't reconcile that completely enough in my head to truly enjoy the book.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|This movie was highly overlooked when it first came out. I watched it again after purchasing the 10th anniversary edition. The movie is great, really makes one reflect on what matters in life. Do not miss the dream sequence. The Coen Brothers always paint vivid characters. Should be in everyones collection. It will make you a Coen Brother fan for sure.    The extra stuff is good. Each of the main characters reflect on the movie's impact 10 years latter, pluss other good stuff. Don't pass this one up
B001IUBZAU|4.0|This is quite frankly the best album I've heard from AC/DC since 'Back in Black'. 'Stiff Upper Lip' was a great album but it pales in comparison to this. Want some straight ahead classic rock, do yourself a favor and get this NOW!!
B000SFJWLU|5.0|Make no mistake about it,Five Finger Death Punch is a perfect name for this band,and yes they ARE a metal band,period. The bands pedigree speaks for itself,and there is anough melody,brutality,diversity,and absolutely killer riffs and songwriting on this album to appease fans of all different genres,from hardcore to Maiden style melodic metal. If you have been lucky enough to catch these dudes live,you know what I mean when i say its a very visceral experience,Moody is an excellent frontman and the band is super tight,but the brutality and rawness is there. Thank God Ivan didnt decide to walk away from music altogether,and found kindred spirits in this extremely talented band. They are currently on tour with supporters In This Moment,Bury Your Dead,and the excellent new band Another Black Day,and when FFDP took the stage it was apparent to all inside in the Norfolk VA show: we were about to experience something special. Easily one of the best and tightest live bands Ive seen in a great while,and let me just say...at one point the pit was so fierce it looked like something out of a horror film...beautiful. What a great friggin time for metal. Buy this if you havent already and just listen. You will be glad you did.
B0000027RL|1.0|Yeah yeah, Pearl Jam may have came out first...but Creed and Nickelback sound hell of a lot better.  Plus, Pearl Jam.. what a dumb name! And the lyrics/vocals are a complete failure to the brilliance of modern rock heroes Chad Kroeger and Fred Durst.<br /><br />BTW: 'Jeremy' is a terrible song!
B0000DC13U|4.0|Sympathy for the Devil (originally titled One Plus One) was shot in 1968, when Godard's infatuation with Maoist ideology was at fever pitch.  In the films he churned out from 67 to 74 (approximately 18 films, some of which were never released) Godard was struggling to find sounds and visuals that would convey the reality of revolutionary change.  One Plus One works better than most because its central image - a rock band struggling to make a great song - is an inspired metaphor for the turbulent, tedious and confounding process of making a social revolution.<br /><br />Over half the movie is a straightforward documentary of the Rolling Stones working on Sympathy for the Devil, a song from their Beggar's Banquet album.  The deadpan camera captures unglamorous, blue-collar songmaking, filled with dead ends and the odd moment of serendipity.  We see the cohesiveness of the band (except for Brian Jones, pathetically boxed off in the studio, out of tune and out of touch. He drowned shortly afterwards.) and the hard work behind their genius.  The recording sessions are interspersed with revolutionary agitprop - gun toting black revolutionaries in an auto junkyard; communist manifestos being read in a newsagent's shop filled with girlie magazines.  The final element is a moderately amusing voice over prose piece that puts world leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and John Foster Dulles in compromising sexual situations.<br /><br />The message here is that making something new is messy, solipsistic, self-indulgent and occasionally sublime.  In keeping with Godard's idea of revolution as ongoing and unfinished, the director's cut of the movie never included the finished version of the Stones song.  The producer added it later, at the end, over some slapped in color-tinted still frames, earning him a well-deserved punch in the nose from Godard.  (The version reviewed here, with the Sympathy for the Devil title, is the producer's version.)<br /><br />Even while drunk on revolutionary idealism, Godard couldn't stop being a talented and provocative filmmaker.  One Plus One is a successful if occasionally tedious film in its own right.  It's also an interesting period piece, bringing us back to a time when artists, activists and your average hippie all felt they had to do what they were doing in order to get where they were going next, a time when all of it felt dreadfully important, even when it wasn't.couldn't stop being a talented and provocative filmmaker.

B001DDBCUK|5.0|Fantastic movie. Romance is still alive and well. I highly recommend this flick for all you sex and the city fans. Let's hope they get together every 10 years to produce more of the same.
B000I0QM0E|5.0|Sleepy Hollow is just a great looking movie that deserves a DVD play at least once a year in October. This is one of the ultimate Halloween movies. It features spooky sets, one of Danny Elfman's best music scores, enough gore to make Sweeney Todd proud and the visual touches of Tim Burton. The acting is good all around, with no one standing out from the crowd. I like Johnny Depp in this, but it's not one of his best performances. As a whole, Sleepy Hollow is my favorite flick from this director and it has been since I first saw it in theaters back in 1999.
0300108834|4.0|This is an excellent introductory book of world history. Some categorize this as a children's book, I disagree. Although the text is easy to read, some passages are not straight forward and are filled with so many history facts that I doubt children can digest all of them at once.     I enjoyed reading this book as an adult, and would surely recommend it to people who are looking for an Introduction to World History. However, when I have finished reading it, I felt as though this book is still missing something that I wished it had provided.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book. It may not have the deep tragic ending that some people wanted, but I like a happy ending in my reading, therfore I was pleased.

B001DDBCUK|5.0|This movie is great....so much fun yet modern with todays women. This shows how a woman can have both success and love, but it is hard to find and difficult to manage. LOVE THE MOVIE....recommend it, even for those who didnt watch the series.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love this show!! Though I don't have HBO right now I see what I can  on You Tube and I am a major fan, I can't wait till the series is on DVD.<br />Even though it differs here and there from the books i'm still sooo hooked.
B00005K3O4|4.0|The ultimate sci-fi \\"B\\" classic movie.  It you are a fan of the classics, this is one to add to your collection.  Perfect Saturday morning flick. Some blood, so maybe keep very small children away.
B001DHXT20|5.0|I saw nothing wrong with the [[ASIN:B00005JKC3 Hulk]] movie that came out several years before this one. So why the new actors? So far the only consistant character in both films has been [[ASIN:B00094ARV4 Lou Ferrigno]]. Granted the new characters are great (love Liv Tyler as much as I do the chick from [[ASIN:B000R8YC1S Labyrinth]]. And Ed Norton does a great job of being not-so nerdy and not whimpy as Bruce Banner. William Hurt is perfect as the General, and the limey with the thick, British accent in [[ASIN:B000068DBC Pulp Fiction]] plays a superb villian) and the animation is good too, but they could have done something different.<br /><br />We've already seen the \\"birth\\" of the Hulk. How about something more, something fresh?? It doesn't have to be an abomination like [[ASIN:B0000844JI The Incredible Hulk Returns & The Trial of the Incredible Hulk]], where you had Thor and Daredevil \\"helping\\" David Banner get out of trouble. But it could have been different.<br /><br />There aren't much extras on this version. So you'd be better off picking up the [[ASIN:B001DHXT2A Three-Disc Special Edition]] for anything good. There's a commentary (big deal) and a handful of deleted scenes. Plus some signlanguage stuff for deaf people (my guess is that Lou Ferrigno had them put that in, since the dude is deaf as a fax machine), but nothing else.<br /><br />I'm waiting another couple years for another version of the same movie to come out. But this time maybe they'll have Justin Timberlake play Bruce Banner and Drew Barrymore play the love interest. Don't get me wrong, this was a great movie...if you haven't seen the other one. And if you have, you'll still like this one too. I just wish they would have gone in a different direction.
B00000K0EA|3.0|I love all of the Bond movies, but in order to enjoy this one you have to suspend belief to a greater degree than usual.  Why?  Quite simply because we are supposed to believe that a media mogul will risk starting World War III just to grab a few headlines.    Even more ludicrous than that is the statement made at the beginning of the film when it appears that the Chinese have sunk a British warship, and a bright spark exclaims, \\"Send in the Navy!\\"  Send in the what?  I consider myself to be a fiercely patriotic, flag-waving Brit, but Britain now has more Admirals than ships, and the mere suggestion that Britain would single-handedly take on the might of China is laughable.    Still, Bond is Bond.  Suspend your belief system and enjoy the action - three stars for the action, and the loss of two stars for the ridiculous plot.
B000003B6J|5.0|I'm whiter than milk, but I grew up in a rough neighborhood. There weren't bullets flying around, but some dude did get stabbed in front of my house. This album brings me back to those days when I couldn't go out at night, when it was okay to call a black person black, and long before the wanna-be rappers of today started ripping these guys off!<br /><br />I can't relate to the struggle of the black man, in no shape or form no matter how hard I want to. But that doesn't mean I can't learn from them: their struggles to keep women from cheating on them, to dealing with unruley police officials, even how to just lay back with a few chums and enjoy a nice beverage.<br /><br />'Compton' is when they were on top, before the bad-blood was spilled and the names started flying. Cops were racist and Ice Cube was still tough. My favorite is Easy E with his cute little voice and his Don-Won stylings with the females.<br /><br />I still listen to this album, and love the bonus tracks that come with them. I love blasting this album while driving through my old neighborhood, the windows rolled down, and crusing the corners as the eyes follow. They jealous, man! They wants my tunege!!
B00005RHGK|5.0|This is the kind of horror film I love.  The characters are well-rounded, with real dialogue and (usually) logical actions.  The pace is swiftly moving, and the \\"monster\\" is interesting and legitimately scary.  This movie was way better than I thought it would be, and I thought Justin Long put in a great performance.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|For many there is no in between with John Legend, people either love him or dislike him. I am truly a fan. He is so unique. For those who love a more r/b flair, this cd delivers. I liked his second CD but to me, this one is much better than the second and maybe, dare I say, the first. Can't wait to see more from JL!
B001F2W4Y2|2.0|Sad to say, I think AC/DC is done.  Although Brian's voice on Black Ice sounds much better than the last few albums, the song writing is terrible.  With the exception of Runaway Train, the rest of the album is just...blah.  Very bland, predictable, no \\"put the pedal to the floor and give me a speeding ticket\\" type of songs.  Every song starts out slow and you sit there with your finger on the volume knob ready to turn it to 11 when the song \\"kicks in\\", but sadly, it just never happens.  This album is a very tame version of Flick of the Switch (which I like).  It'll be interesting to hear which songs from Black Ice make it to the set list on the upcoming tour (besides the obvious Rock n Roll Train).<br /><br />I can't believe that was the best they could do in eight years.  As a die-hard AC/DC fan since 1978, I have to be honest and say that I would not recommend this album.  It's like an album with one good song and 14 \\"B\\" sides songs.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|Let me first start by saying that I'm a huge Keane fan ever since their first album.    I've got all their albums, visted three concerts in just the last year, keep kinda track of what they're up to and so on.     When I first heard their Spiralling single I initially didn't like it one bit. Talking about style breaks...    I got a slightly worried when Tom Chaplin did an interview stating that they were 'ignoring the rules of good taste' (or wordings of simmilar meaning).     Then I got the album and listened.  And I have to say: I initially did NOT like the new tunes, not even a bit. Period.    Then I listened again. And again. And again. And each time I heard the tracks, I started to love them more and more. And more. And more.    In retrospect, I think I mostly didn't want Keane to change their 'formula' that I liked so much. With a closed mind it's sometimes hard to appreciate change.    Let me tell you one thing: this album IS in fact totally Keane. It's Keane music, just packaged differently.   I bet any capable producer could just pick these compositions and reshape them in the old style.    But why do so? All these songs are little presents, and you need to open them up slowely, and 'play' with it for some time. And then you'll fully appreciate what Keane has done to them.    I've been to the Keane concert just days ago and they played quite a few songs from the new album. Mind you, the album had just been out for two weeks or so. So the band didn't really get a chance to test these new numbers in a live setting too much. But boy, do these songs work live!    There are no bad tracks on this albums, but a few numbers really stand out IMHO:    Black Burning Heart: by far the best song.  Perfect Symmetry: another excellent track.  The Lovers Are Losing: classy pop song.  Love Is The End: works so d*mn well live!  Better Than This: hated it at first, love it now.  Again & Again: probably one of their next singles...  You Don't See Me: 'classical' Keane tune.Try it. If you like Keane music, you'll love it.   But if you particuallary like the songs of their first (and second) album, then you to may need to give it a few listens before you appreciate the great work that has been done by Keane.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Great movie with moving content.  The music throughout the movie was stirring and emotional.  William is portrayed as having a deep passion for ending slavery at any cost.  It consumes his being.  It is a drive he cannot ignore and he dedicates his life to it, ultimately sacrificing his own will for his life to fulfill God's purpose. This is a great movie for older kids to see. Although not young children, due to the themeatic elements and a few visual scenes that may be disturbing.  Also, the content is too mature for young kids to understand or follow what is going on.   I also enjoyed the music video bonus.

The big house in the desert does not seem authentic for that dry rustic setting. The special effects were great for that time. Note the message of this movie: only the Federal government can save you from alien threats. In an earlier time the unity of the people would have ended the threat. I once read that the breathing of insects limits their size; they could never grow that big (except in Hollywood). I wonder if they are putting \\"synthetic compounds\\" into animals today?

B000062XGK|2.0|This film opens with a submarine beneath the sea. It detects an unknown object speeding towards them. What could it be? The submarine strikes some rocks and sinks rapidly. Only a buoy marks the spot. There will be an investigation, and a civilian oil rig crew will try to rescue the USS Montana before the hurricane arrives in a few hours. The conversation introduces the people and shows their interactions. The deep diving ships locate the submarine and inspect it. Some enter the submarine to explore it. There are no survivors. One diver has a problem. A strange event occurs. The storm arrives, and mechanical troubles occur to create perils.    There is one disaster after another, and narrow escapes from floods. Will they survive in the cold when the oxygen runs low? Will a strange creature show up? Will the stress affect some of the people? Will we see more special effects? Will there be serious conflicts over their missions? What about pressure psychosis? There is drama from the personal conflicts and the machines. Who will be saved? Bud volunteers for a perilous mission. Will he be saved by a miracle? What about the remaining people?    This is a film that seem too disparate to make sense. A coherent script would make a better film.

B000YAA68W|5.0|I recommend this movie to evreyone, specially to those that doubt about the good of freedom. This film has a lot to do in some way with wat is happening in Venezuela. A similar type of government is destroying all sorts of liberties. You can see through this film the luck we have to live in free countries and the importance of the values of a free society. The animation is really good and a some scenes are funny. A must see
B000K1P66W|5.0|This book is a concise roadmap to getting healthy and living in the present. Having read a small mountain of self-help books in the past this is the ONE book I would point to as an absolute guide to a simple effective way to turn things around.
B001E18C68|4.0|I bought the 2 DVD and 2 CD version.and was so excited when I got it. As an Australian fan.. I have never had the opportunity to see them live and when I first heard they were doing a concert with a full orchestra, I was excited beyond belief.     However, when watching it, I had one serious problem.. Because Within Temptation already use a live orchestra in recordings.. this live dvd made it sound like I was just listening to the album.     When Metallica did their S&M concert, it was such an amazing and different sound to their album which is what made it so brilliant to listen to.. But Within Temptation are a band that relies too heavily on orchestra in their albums for this concert to be so effective.     Don't get me wrong. I love this concert and as a performace it is five stars. But the inclusion of the orchestra in this cicumstance doesn't really ad anything new that we don't hear on the album.     Within Temptation are amazing and so is the orchestra but after all the wait and anticipation, the inclusion of the orchestra isn't really noticed and audio-wise, I just felt like all I was getting was a greatest hits album.

1904265790|3.0|This is a sequential collection of Dredd's first adventures in 2000AD, and as such it's pretty rough and ready as the writers and artists find their feet - for instance the city isn't even known as Mega City 1 (it's actually sometimes referred to as Old New York), and the city still has a police force working alongside the judges. While there are some good stories here, if you're looking to see what all the fuss about Dredd is about then this might not be the best place to start. Reading this would be a bit like reading the first published Superman/Batman stories - interesting, but not likely to wow you.
B001F7XIJW|4.0|TWOAF is a very good album, in terms, of death/metal. Bulldozer riffs(some of the best in 08) and the drummer is flat-out ridiculous. The one song that contains \\"robotic\\" vocals doesn't do much for me, and the 75 minute length is well, bloated. Gojira could have cut the \\"fat\\" off of this by at least, 15 minutes and still composed a massive album. I hear a few references to Mesuggah and Textures, but this is Gojira doing what they do best. I think this band has an awesome future, and already a pretty decent cataloque. Strong addition to any type of music collection. Really, this is a 9/10.

B000J10ERO|4.0|After missing from film screens for nearly twenty years and nearly twenty eight years since the first Christopher Reeve film, the question everyone was undoubtedly was if the franchise could be resurrected and as this film proves the answer is a most definite \\"yes\\" with this film which may actually be better then the 1978 film that started it all.<br /><br />A film is about as good as its leading actor and without the right actor playing Superman the film could easily have failed. But with newcomer Brandon Routh in the role many fears were laid to rest. Routh, like Reeve before him, slips into the role so well that within moments of his appearance as the Man of Steel he BECOMES Superman. Physically he is a perfect fit for Superman with his black hair, blue eyes, height, build and everything in between. But it just isn't the physical nature that Routh fits into the role, it's also in his acting ability. Drawing inspiration from Reeve's performances in Superman and Superman II in order to perfectly fit into the roles of both Superman and Clark Kent, Routh is successful in marinating the strong masculine side of Superman and the clumsy, almost geeky, nature of Clark Kent. In short, Routh is Superman.<br /><br />The rest of the cast draws no complaints either. Kate Bosworth, despite being only 23, fits into the role of Lois Lane just as well as Routh as Superman. While she does lack some of the spunk of Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, she does play the sensitive side of Lois very well and her scenes with Superman are a highlight of the film as are her humorous exchanges with Perry White. Frank Langella slips well into the role of Perry White with comfortable ease as he is a foil for Lois and personifies the public's excitement about Superman's return. James Marsden does well in the role of Richard Perry, though his character does at time become a little annoying. Sam Huntington brings a lot of comic relief to the movie in the role of Jimmy Olson. Eva Marie Saint makes a welcomed appearance as Martha Kent and does very well in her few scenes in the film.<br /><br />And there is of course Kevin Spacey. If there was anyone out there who could possibly pull off the role of Lex Luthor besides Gene Hackman, it would be Spacey. And Spacey does it well. Spacey makes the role his own in more ways then one, brining a more humorous touch to the role. But while he brings more humor to Luthor, he also brings menace. When he has to be, Spacey can be more menacing then Hackman's Luthor ever was as demonstrated on the Krypton Island during one of the film's most shocking scenes. If there's a sequel (which is almost assured) I hope that Spacey, along with the rest of the cast, returns because you can't imagine a Superman movie without them now.<br /><br />Behind the camera, there is also a lot of talent at work also. Bryan Singer takes the realism and emotion from his X-Men movies and brings it to the film with great results. With a script by the two X-Men writers that they cooked up with Singer, the film's storyline is for the most part inspired. The idea of using Superman's disappearance as a catalyst for a story is inspired to say the least and the films' action sequences share the originality that the first two Christopher Reeve's film had in them. But it's the films plot that brings about the film's only major flaw. Luthor's plot seems to be a bit outlandish (even more so then say sinking California into the ocean) and the various schemes that he goes trough to get to that point serve to slow down the pace of the film considerably and create the only boring parts of the film.<br /><br />But what sets this film apart from other comic book movies / sequels is that there is an obvious love for the Christopher Reeve films present throughout the movie. From the film's opening credits, done in the style of the first movies legendary credits, to Marlon Brando's narration and brief appearance during the film, it is obvious that the film is both a sequel and homage.<br /><br />This is evident in two areas specifically: the production design and the music. John Barry's designs for the Fortress of Solitude in particular shines right trough onto the screen in all of its original glory along side with new designs for the Daily Planet and in many respects Metropolis itself, representing the infusing of the new with the old to create something better.<br /><br />But it is in the music that the greatest homage can be found. The opening frame of the film treats us to a new version of one of the greatest film scores of all time: John Williams score to Superman The Movie. The film opens with the Krypton theme and then goes into a full out rendition of the classic theme and it does so to the point that one is left in awe at the end of the opening credits as the theme not heard in full force since 1978 marks the return just as much as anything else in the film. The classic love theme also makes itself heard in the film and it adds to the majesty and wonder of the film. But composer John Ottman also brings out new material to accompany the classic Williams pieces and the music stands up next to the Williams score and holds it own.<br /><br />For the sum of its parts, Superman Returns is the resurrection of one of the greatest characters of all time. Not only does it resurrect him, it also brings the character soaring back to new heights in surpassing the films that made this film pays homage to so much.. Superman Returns indeed and we can only hope he's here to stay.as specifically: the production design and the music.

0345347951|5.0|Old fashion Sci-Fi by one of the titans of the genre, Childhood's End keeps you guessing. It's not the typical story about aliens coming to earth and dominating man you might be expecting. It delves into the deeper issues of mankind's future and place in the universe with an interesting array of characters and situations.     Most books aren't much of a surprise; you pretty much know what's going to happen ahead of time, not true here. I loved the story, and couldn't put the book down. Clarke hasn't been considered a master of Sci-Fi for nothing, and here he's at his best.    An imaginative story that's very well written, it's a short book at 212 pages, and a quick read, making it a must for any Sci-Fi fan.
1416955070|5.0|I read reviews constantly on amazon.com, but have never written one. But I felt I had to add to this discussion because I feel some of the reviews for this book are far too negative, and might dissuade someone from reading a truly wonderful series. I almost didn't read this book because of said reviews, but as I received the second book in the series for free, I wanted to read the first book before I read the second book (City of Ashes, which is also wonderful). I am so glad I did. I love these characters and I love this series. To you other Twilight Moms, I highly recommend Clary and Jace as a balm for how must you  must be missing Bella, Edward, and Jacob, as I was. I'm a 37 year old mom and I can't believe I have to wait until March when the third book (City of Glass) will be released. Try it, you won't be disappointed.
B000002AH7|5.0|....I bought this album.  I had The Man with the Horn (my first Miles album), We Want Miles (2nd one), and Bitches Brew.  This was the fourth one (and the last one I would buy on vinyl).  I had them in high school, and while I played the others, I hardly ever played this one (now, I never play The Man with the Horn, as it's pretty bad, and I hardly play We Want Miles.  I still dig Brew, though).  I didn't like it at all, even though several of the tracks are epic length.  A year ago or so, I bought the CD, and thanks to better ears and maturity, it has occurred to me that this is one of Miles's greatest albums, and quite possibly his most beautiful, and certainly his best colloboration with Gil Evans.  The opening track, Concierto de Aranjuez (adagio), has to be Miles's most majestic song ever, or at least one of his most majestic songs ever.  His playing is so subtle and moving.  My other favorite is the original album's closer, Solea.  It's another moving, subtle song (written by Gil Evans).  The whole album is really an orchestral album, which is just fine, as it's so well done and a deserved classic.<br /><br />Miles's colloboration with Gil Evans was one of the most productive in music history, and this is the greatest example of two great artists creating timeless art and music.  I'm glad time has made me appreciate the greatness of this album, and it has taken its rightful place as one of my favorite Miles's albums.
B0018M6J90|5.0|I just finished watching this movie and I can tell you that there are several laugh-out-loud moments, and that the film overall is fantastic.  You are drawn straight in to Miss Pettigrew's world and cannot help but sympathize with her lot in life, especially after the guy behind her bumps into her, throwing her food on the ground in the outdoor soup kitchen line.  The poor girl thrusts herself unknowingly into a night of drama and fun in high society and is taken for a ride by the younger, more petty crowd around her.  And of course, Ciaran Hinds saves the day with his dashing good looks and down-to-earth attitude about the impending war.<br />A movie well worth watching, whether you like comedy, romance, or a little historical drama.
B00005T30L|5.0|This is a great, great movie.  It could have easily gone off into another variation of the typical indie film.  Instead of being smug and overly quirky like many indie films can be, this film is genuine, intelligent, and humanistic as well.  I atttribute this to the director, Terry Zwigoff, who directed one of my favorite documentaries, Crumb, and the two excellent leads, Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch.  Buscemi here is especially good, playing a character that could have easily turned into a caricature with a lesser director and actor.  Buscemi plays a lonely 42 year old bachelor who lives with an astonishing record collection.  Some may have portrayed him with snark and made him look like a loser, but Buscemi and Zwigoff give him humanity and soul, and it makes for one of Buscemi's greatest performances.  He's really underrated as an actor.  Birch is excellent, too, as the sarcastic, yet human girl who takes a liking to Buscemi.  Again, their romance feels real, and she seems to genuinely like him, despite the differences in age.  It's not forced, sleazy, and it's not done for the sake of being quirky.  This is one of the best indie films I've ever seen.
0978053583|5.0|This was a gift and they said that it was hard to start but once in you could not put it down.
0783240236|5.0|I bought this DVD for our 14 year grandson for Halloween as a scary movie but not too scary.  I haven't heard yet how he likes it. However the purchasing went smoothly and we got it in the mail quickly and everything else went smoothly
B001G5IJVK|4.0|I have to agree with one of the previous reviewers (and with all due respect to Gene and Paul) - It's great to see discs that showcase Ace and Peter. To be honest, it's the Ace songs that were the selling point for me to buy the original KISS recordings in the first place. We all know that this was put out for monetary reasons, but is does make a nice addidtion to any KISS collection. It's just too bad that there aren't enough Eric Carr KISS tracks to make a fifth disc. That would have been extremely cool to see.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I feel this series should be required viewing in all schools.  It would help us remember just how difficult it was to win our freedom, and perhaps we would value it more.  Where are the men like these now, when we need them so desperately?
B000T02NM4|5.0|OK - I agree - more pop then their interesting and melodic earlier synth-tech albums - but I was into OMD since their first album (yes album) and when I bought this one, I wore it out.  It may just be me, but the songs on this album are more accessible and really stick in your head.  If you are not familiar with OMD, but an 80's fan, I highly recommend.
B001G9FFM2|5.0|Although this is a double dip it is one of an album that will go down in history as one of the best in metal. The cd has all the songs from the original release and as every Machine Head fan knows they are awesome. Although this time it comes with 2 extra tracks on it. Hallowed Be Thy Name by Iron Maiden and Battery by Metallica from the Metal Hammer tributes and they are great additions to this already perfect cd. They cover the songs perfectly while giving them a little Machine Head flavor. Great first disc.     But the main reason to get this is the bonus DVD. They don't give you a half hearted effort as most bands do when they re release an album. This DVD is stacked with great performances. All pro shot and incredible sound quality. Although they are all great the 2 that stand out are 2 that not many have seen. First is them playing Clenching The Fists Of Dissent, Now I Lay Thee Down, and Halo From their headlining performance at the Full Force Festival. The quality and intensity of the band are here in full force :) . They are perfect and this is the best sounding of the performances. Next are 4 songs from the Burn My Eyes 10th anniversary show which is incredible as well. They play A thousand lie, The Rage To Overcome, Death Church, and Blood for Blood perfectly and only make you hope the whole show will be released in the future. This is by far the holy grail of the DVD but there is so much more. They show  them playing Imperium and Old from last years Donnington Download Festival which was amazing. Most publications considered them the best performance over the 3 day event and one even included it as the 7th best performance in the history of metal and that's no lie. The last of the live footage is them at the Rock in Rio Festival. They play Aesthetics of Hate and Davidian to perfection in front of and enormous crowd. I'm in awe of how incredible the live footage is here. This alone would make it worth it but there's more. A great little documentary on themaking of The Blackening which is great as it shows them arranging the songs and explaining the concept behind the killer artwork of the album and the inspiration behind the songs. Another nice bonus. They finish off with 3 videos from the album which are Aesthetics of Hate(which I was at the Norva the night they filmed the live part of it), Now I Lay Thee Down, and Halo and teh making of each of the videos. An awesome bonus to the already classic cd. Metal fans, Machine Head fans. This is a no brainer. While I'm not big on re releasing albums Machine head, who have always been a fans band make this re issue more than worth it. The only thing I can hope for is in the future to release a stacked DVD with the complete sets from these festivals and the BME show. Go now, support this incredible band. You won't be disappointed as the cd is perfect and the DVD is over the top incredible. It's worth every penny. So I highly recommend any metal fan pick this up. You most definitely won't regret it. An awesome, inspiring, release!
B00003CX8Y|3.0|This is one of my favorite Disney films. I was excited when I pulled it out of the box to show it to my 3-year-old daughter for the first time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the DVD. I'm not sure if it's a bootleg copy or if it's just because my vendor shipped the Canadian version (the DVD box was white), but other people have complained about Disney shoehorning too much stuff onto the DVD.<br /><br />The quality of the images is inconsistent. In some places, it looks chunky and lo res. Belle's Papa's eye color keeps changing.<br />But worst of all, my 6-month-old DVD player keeps putting a blue bar across the top of the screen with a little movie projector icon every time there's a difference between the regular and work-in-progress edition.<br /><br />I'm ready to give the DVD to Goodwill and wait for the next version to come out. Buy Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella or Snow White and wait it out.
B001EZ78T6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying Evolver!  Now, take this how you will, but this album is so full of feel good, wear your heart on your sleeve and be ok with it songs, that I'm inclined to call it sappy :)  The sappiness, or perhaps the openness of a guy being into someone and knowing he got it right or wrong, is touching.        Besides that, the songs feel infinitely less \\"elevatorish\\" (you know, you hear a good melody, don't pay attention to the words - not even the chorus, and could either take or leave the music, but it doesn't leave a strong impression?) than those on 2006's Once Again which I have on my \\"Listen to at work\\" playlist, but I can't say I remember a single song/title/chorus off that cd.    My favourites are Good Morning (intro and song), Green Light (which made me buy the CD after hearing it on CBS' season lineup previews), Quickly (made me think of the troops), Satisfaction (good beat), Take Me Away, and, of course, If You're Out There (kinda reminds me of Ordinary People).  And lastly, It's Over is good all around.    If you like \\"ballads\\" or songs with stories...this album is for you.    Enjoy!
B001DXS4E2|4.0|The Abraham number in the colorized version is brown face not black!  Blackface is burnt cork, and Bing mentions the word at least 2 or 3 times.<br />When he is \\"blackening\\" Marjorie Reynold's face it is correct, yet 5 minutes later when she comes out it has turned \\"brown\\".<br /><br />If you are going to colorize a film that has blackface, don't opt to be politically correct.  Do it right!<br /><br />Otherwise most of the other colors are fine.  Although there are sections of the film when only parts are colorized.  When he first sings White Christmas the background is still gray and white, while the center framed figures are colorized.<br /><br />On the plus side the costumes are colorized quite well, especially the Washington's B-day number.
0525478183|5.0|Love the witty banter in this one--there is always a tension between the very serious and the dorkily funny...  Margo is gorgeous and adventure loving past the point of reason.  Quentin is a dork who lives next door to her & has always had a crush on her.  When Margo breaks into his room in the middle of the night dressed like a ninja & asked him to help with a revenge plot, Quentin is both scared & exuberantly happy...  John Green is hilarious & poignant & any author that can do both in the same book is pretty fantastic by my definition.
0783226888|3.0|Picked up this dvd in the 5.00 bin at walmart yesterday.  I was actually pleasantly surprised.  No, it,s not a five star flick but I,ve certainly seen a lot worse.  I think the video transfer could have been better but all and all not a bad action flick.  If you find it in the 5.00 walmart bin I,d definitly recomend it
B0000542D2|5.0|Classic Beatles film,a great restored widescreen transfer of the classic A Hard Day's Night,this is a 2 dvd set with the movie on the first dvd and the extras on the second disc!!! A must for Beatles fans!!! And the price is right to boot!!! Get this before it goes out of print(and the price skyrockets!),Beatles titles seem be under this fate!!! Very recommended!!!
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|Great rock & roll from AC/DC...what more can you ask for? Definitely their best stuff in many years.
B001CDLATE|4.0|Any one else having problems with the 8k disc?  Plays on other blu-ray players but not mine, Sony SBP-300 (and I updated to version 4.20 - the latest firmware)<br /><br />Update 8/7/13:<br />After reading the follow up commentary, I will acknowledge that I gave a very low score due to the fact that the movie would not play.  To the extent that my lame early edition Sony blu-ray player could not play the disc, i rated the movie on that basis since they did put a product out there in the stream of commerce that gave several blu-ray players at the time of release a really hard time.  Now that I have no issues with pplayback, I can say that this movie is intense and worth the repeated viewing, the movie itself deserves 4 stars.  To those amazonians that i offended, please understand my 2008 frustration with this physical product, but the actual move is stupendous, no question.
B000002U82|5.0|For years the music of this album has been living in my head, playing on and on. As a lunatic, many times I faced the new moon and I could clearly see its dark face changing into a cristal prism with a colourful brush of refracted light. And I could listen to the voice of a women shaping a great gig in the sky. So I breath in the air and I have no other need than listening to the music coming from the spheres. And to feel its vibration fulfilling everything under the sun, until the sun was eclipsed by the moon.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|The first thing I would like to say, is that everyone is talking about the BLUE/RED 3D glasses. However, if you DO have a copy of one of those BLUE/RED glasses, they wont work. That's because the  color coding the DVD makers use, is MAGENTA/GREEN.  So, that's a shame, because as trite and worthless as color coding 3D movies go, I still like silly gimicks. I was hoping that the lazer type of 3D was what was encoded here, but not so. Therefore, even if you rent this, your own 3D glasses wont work, and the glasses from the theater wont work, cos they only work in the theaters. OK, so we watch the 2D movie.....all 85 minutes of it.  JOURNEY is a kid's action adventure film staring Brendan Fraser, with a kid's version of a relationship story involved. (Do 40 year old guys say to 13 year olds, \\"I have dibs on the guide\\"? ) Actually, this film isnt a total failure, maybe close to a two and a half star film, but it makes the Pat Boone version of JOURNEY seem like an arthouse film, in comparison. I kept thinking, \\"This guy stared in GODS AND MONSTERS, obviously he can act, why doesnt he?\\" No doubt he's type cast, and thats a shame. In fact, if Hollywood keeps making films based on comic books, remakes of trite films, or bad concepts (3D, or human/animation interaction, or whatever) you might as well learn Spanish, german or japanese, and wait for a GOOD film to come out. The only reason to watch this film, is if you are under the age of 13.  Like NATIONAL TREASURE, or THE MUMMY, it really isnt made for adults, or even older teens.  In fact, Hollywood would do well, to change its rating system, so that it says UNDER 13 years old ONLY, or UNDER 18-22 years old ONLY.  The worst think a film can do, is insult the intelligence of its audience. Now, i should have realized, WHAT KIND OF ADULT FILM WOULD BE MADE IN 3D? Its about as adult appropiate, as Micky D's FUN MEALS.  Its not even \\"IRONIC\\" fun.  Maybe 3D belongs in theaters only, for kids films, using the lazer interference glasses only.  It doesnt seem to work on TVs.asses only.  It doesnt seem to work on TVs.
1574241451|4.0|Good book, but a bit short. Lots of pictures. Considering it's the only book I've found devoted to the 335, it's a must have, but would have liked more information.
B00139B39E|4.0|I'm a very big fan of dream theater and this compilation was very very good, although i wanted a few songs instead of others but it's pretty cool how they remastered songs.
B00005NWLO|4.0|I want SO much to love this album.  It was one of the all-time great live releases from the seventies.  Arguably still is...but, in reading the new liner notes, the legendary producer Tom Dowd blatantly states, \\"...we decided to clean it up [ the Fox multi-track tapes ] in a few places.  Ronnie touched up some of his vocals and we redid the girls on one or two songs.  Allen also wanted to make another pass on his 'Free Bird' solo...\\" This may seem like very small potatoes to a lot of people, but a true live recording contains NO overdubs  ( added tracks or repaired ones ).  I don't kid myself that it doesn't routinely happen  ( admittedly it would be too tempting, given a twenty-four track recording, not to fix a bum guitar or vocal note here and there )...but how can Ronnie have said, after the Fox shows, \\"We decided immediately to do an honest live album...no overdubbing...\\"  having just come from doing overdubs in Miami a month after the Atlanta concerts?  Interestingly, Kansas recently rereleased its classic live album, Two For the Show, with two band members clearly stating that no overdubs of any kind were done...what is heard is exactly what went down at the concerts, \\"Warts and All\\".  These Skynyrd tracks remain white hot in enthusiasm and intensity...an occasional wart or zit would merely add to the authenticity of the album for me.  And yes, I've flogged this horse long enough!  Just be aware, live album purists, that this one technically never was.  The irony, after all these years, lies in one of the highlights of this new release being Allen Collins' original lead guitar solo from \\"Free Bird\\"  ( I've only very recently learned that he overdubbed it on the seventies release ). I'll close this review with another quote from the new liner notes:  \\"...when you hear [ Al's ] original solo, you may wonder why he wanted to do those 29 retakes\\".  A resounding \\"Amen\\" to that!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Oh yes, P!nk is back, and she's hotter than ever! So I was never really a big fan of P!nk. I actually thought she was really obnoxious. But oh how wrong I was. After watching some of her videos (interviews and all that fun stuff), I realized how down to earth she is. Also, she is an AMAZING performer! My god, she throws everyone out of the water with her stunts. Anyways, then I got into her music, and am I glad I did! Her music is amazing, especially since she wrote them herself. They're so raw and emotional, yet fun and sassy. It's a perfect mix for my liking.      1. So what - 10/10. First single off the album. First song off her new album that I was hooked on. Love it! Very upbeat and fun!    2. Sober - 9/10. This is a good song too, but more on the softer side. It took me a couple listens before loving it. It's a great song that really captures her personal struggles.    3. I Don't Believe You - 10/10. Pure emotion! This is one of the ballads on her CD, and it's a very good one at that. It's so raw and beautiful, with heartbreaking lyrics about Carey. And man, does P!nk deliver on this one!     4. One Foot Wrong - 6/10. I don't know about this one. It took me a couple tries before finally listening to the whole thing. It definitely doesn't stand out for me, but her voice makes it an alright song.     5. Please Don't Leave Me - 9/10. A slower song, probably about her breakup again. It's a good song with a bit of a beat, despite it's melancholy tune.     6. Bad Influence - 10/10. What can I say? BI is a great upbeat rock song that you can just dance around to. The lyrics are quite funny (in a good way), and it definitely gets you pumped for the night out.     7. Funhouse - 10/10. Fun, upbeat, catchy tune! I LOVE this song. The lyrics are a bit sad since it relates to her breakup, but P!nk still finds a way to liven it up. She shows everyone that she's still fun, and I believe her!     8. Crystal Ball - 10/10. This is a slower song, but equally as good as the rest.It's has more of an acoustic feel, which really showcases her beautiful voice. Great song!     9. Mean - 10/10. At first, I skipped this song quite a lot because it sounded so country to me. However, it caught me by surprise when I actually listened to it for the first time. This is an amazing ballad, so lyrically well-done, and sung with so much passion. This is one of the knock-outs on the album. Also about Carey.     10. It's All Your Fault - 7/10. This is another song that took me a couple tries before liking it. It's not a bad song, but it doesn't stand-out like the rest. The song gets pretty great near the middle-end when there's more of a beat to it.     11. Ave Mary A - 10/10. Amazing song! At first, I thought it was another breakup song, but it's not. It's actually about the many dysfunctional aspects of our world, especially how many people are being negatively influenced by the detrimental effects of our external environment. Great message, intelligent lyrics, and great tune. P!nk really knows what she's talking about and I salute her.      12. Glitter In The Air - Another ballad. Very pure and simple, without neglecting passion and depth. A great song.     Overall, I give this album 5 out of 5 stars. P!nk is so amazingly talented, beautiful inside and out, and intelligent. It's a rarity amid our row of artists today. Through her series of mixed songs, it's obvious that her divorce caused one hell of an emotional roller coaster. P!nk may have been down, but she certainly climbed right back up, and she's showing everyone that she's better than ever!
B000089RV6|5.0|Actually, Led Zeppelin's catalog surpasses any other band's in terms of musical quality, but for an album that is focused on balls to the wall hard rock, Back in Black is IT. Nearly every song is killer, no filler. Well, for me \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You Baby\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" are kind of lame, but the strength of the other tracks just demolishes any of the album's weaknesses. Everybody knows the greatness of \\"Hells Bells\\", the title song and \\"You Shook Me...\\", but I think an overlooked song is \\"Have A Drink On Me\\"...THE GREATEST HARD ROCK SONG EVER! I thought that when I was 14 (when I bought the album) and still think that today (I'm now 41). A bluesy, killer intro riff, catchy chord changes...and that passage from where it builds up after the solo into that SCORCHING last verse (kind of like a bridge at the end of the song)...KICKS A*S!!! That song alone is worth twice the price of the whole album!    So if you're only going to buy one AC/DC album, this is it, hands down. 20 million buyers of this disc are not wrong.
1400063515|2.0|I labored over a 2 or 3 star rating but ended up at a 2 since I decided to punish hubris in the wake of the Wall Street scandals.  The book is an interesting read but you have to keep an open mind and get past the author's incredible arrogance and condescension. He basically tells you that you and everyone you know are stupid because you do not think the way he thinks you should think. Some chapters have some merit and when he is not so busy telling you how dumb you are, he can make his point effectively.  One problem I had was the idea that many of his &#34;Black Swan&#34; events were actually unexpected. Events like 9/11 were actually predicted, not least of all from Ramszi Yousef, the man who performed the Feb 26, 1993 attack who said they would come back to finish the job. The 9/11 Commission report listed basically 10 things that pointed to the attack which if performed would have prevented it. Five were in the Clinton Administration and five in the Bush Administration (although to be fair, the Clinton Administration had a lot more time to actually learn the threat and do something about it since the first attack happened on their watch as well).  I have heard others say that the author's previous book was more helpful without the biting sarcasm and self promotion.
B00005JPO1|3.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull starring Harrison Ford is a decent 4th installment of the Indy series. To me Ford looks exactly the same even my folks beg to differ, his performance is classic Indiana, he plays a brainy goofball pretty well. Cate Blanchett's thick accent is a bit much and Shia Labeouf shows what he's made of as a '50s greaser. Good flick, better than expected.
B000025RHI|1.0|this album is just blah, re-working a whole commercial reggae thang in no particular intriguing or original way.definitely nothing underground thats been dug up as any gem this one
0810979772|5.0|I ordered this book for my 10 year old son and he loves it.  There are so many different things to do, including the diary.  He mainly enjoys the madlibs but who doesnt.  Great buy, I would recommend to any parent who has a child with a vivid imagination.

031606792X|5.0|This was a perfect ending to the series for me.  I got everything I wanted and more.  I hope SM does another book related to this series so we can see how things are going for Bella and Edward.  Maybe from the child's point of view.
B00005GL0V|5.0|So another Beatles album gets another really high score. Not only that, but outside of the Beatles Triumvirate (Abbey Road, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band), this is my favorite Beatles album! This was the last album they ever released, and what a way to go out! A lot of people consider it a lesser work, but I firmly disagree. Not even Phil \\"murderous sociopath with worse hair than Don King\\" Spector's production job can kill it! It's true that \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" is gutted, but no amount of overproduction can stop the fact that, beneath the layers of everything (including the kitchen sink, not to mention a choir, a brass section, strings, and a gong at the end), there is a fantastic melody waiting. You can hear that melody on the piano-bass-drums-vocals version of \\"Road\\" found on Let It Be... Naked, by the way, which is far superior to this take and one of my Beatle favorites. And I actually think the production adds to a couple songs: all the brass gives Harrison's cynical waltz \\"I Me Mine\\" an edge; and the trippy effects similarly make \\"Across the Universe\\" seem even more cosmic. And then there are the songs that really kick butt. You've heard the title track, I'm hoping? It's Paul's greatest piano ballad ever, with the exception of nothing at all. It just may be the best song he ever wrote, though I'd also pull for \\"Hey Jude\\" or maybe \\"Penny Lane\\" on that count. Guest Billy Preston adds a beautiful gospel organ to the song, and the heavy guitar riffs add emotional texture to the song. You probably also know \\"Get Back\\", a fun rocker with some wonderful slide guitar, and there's a lot of other grade a material in that vein - the captivating nonsense \\"Dig a Pony\\", \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" (which contains this awesome part in the last verse where Paul sings the verse lyrics and John contrasts it with the bridge, which in turn has a funny lyric about everyone in the world having a wet dream at the same time), Chuck Berry throwback \\"One After 909\\", which takes a lot of abuse but is actually a personal favorite, \\"Two of Us\\", a welcome return to Rubber Soul's folk-rock. I guess a lot of these songs are either \\"generic Beatle rockers\\" or \\"generic Beatle ballads\\" - the only break from the formula is \\"For You Blue\\", an excellent blues with more slide - but I like what I'm hearing regardless, because generic or not, these tracks are good! Most controversial amongst fans are the two subminute tracks. I love \\"Dig It\\", a goofy, stupid throwaway with amusing lyrics, though I admit it would probably be awful if it was presented in the eight-minute version that allegedly exists somewhere in the vaults. On the other hand, \\"Maggie Mae\\" - not the Rod Stewart hit, but a Liverpudlian folk tune - annoys me, with the group singing the ballad of that dirty no-good rotten Maggie Mae in the most exaggerated, annoying accents they could muster up. At least it's only thirty-nine seconds. Thankfully, it's the only bad song on the album. It ain't art, it's just one of the Beatles' finest albums.which takes a lot of abuse but is actually a personal favorite, \\"Two of Us\\", a welcome return to Rubber Soul's folk-rock.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|... for pointing James, Lars, Kirk, and Robert in the right direction. I love this CD! It rocks! There are no fillers. Anyone who criticizes this CD has not given it enough playing time. You should not compare it to their older releases. When I heard that Rick Rubin was involved with Metallica I was hoping for the best. I am very satisfied. There are guitar riffs and solos all over the place. You can tell the band put a lot of time and effort into these songs. They worked hard. Everything is perfectly calculated. The sound quality is excellent. Seeing these guys on tour is a must! Hearing whatever they play off of Death Magnetic plus the old songs is essential! Cannot wait for 2/1/09!!
0525478183|5.0|This book is full of awesome. John Green also happens to be full of awesome. All of his books are ovbiously full of awesome. Read this book. and DFTBA.
0061537934|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book! It is so fresh and unique to be told from the dog's point of view, but it isn't a \\"cutsey\\" point of view but more like an old soul telling the story about the admiration they feel for their families, the pain they feel when we feel it and the happiness when we are happy. I read it in two days, then my neighbor read it in two days and then passed it on to her 17 year old son who also loved it.    I am not a racing fan in any way but that is not really what the story is about. You'll appreciate this book even if you aren't a dog lover BUT if you ARE a dog lover, you will absolutely cherish it and want to share it with everyone you know!! I wish I hadn't read it yet so I could read it again for the first time!!
0312360266|4.0|From page one in \\"Marked\\", the reader is thrown headfirst into the world that P.C. Cast and her daughter has created around Zoey Redbird.  When the character of Zoey is first introduced we have absolutely no idea what is going on - she's horribly sick and keeps coughing in a disgusting way -and then suddenly she is \\"marked\\" aka has a half moon on her forehead which indicates that she is a vampire and has to report to the closest House of Night school to continue her vampire education before she is considered \\"full-fledged\\", which she'll have to go through the \\"change\\" in order to do that (more on that in subsequent books).  Anyway, Zoey's parents are religious and flip out even though Zoey didn't choose to be a vampire fledgling.  The only person on her side is her American Indian grandmother before she reports to the school.  The first half of the book is maybe 3 out of 5 stars just because it took some time to get used to Zoey's narrative and her descriptions about what the heck is going on at the House of Night.  The second half I give a 4 out of 5 stars with an eagerness to continue the series after the last page of book one is read.  You definately come to love Zoey's world: her shady mentor and House of Night High Priestess, Neferet; her country-girl roommate, Steve-Rae, as well as the other kids in her \\"group\\"; Aphoridite, the frenemy who has her own agenda where Zoey is concerned and last but not least, Erik Night, Aphrodite's ex and Zoey's new love interest.  All in all the book is really good and the series gets better.  Zoey is a normal girl at the beginning of the book that gets thrown into the vampire world but does it with a fearlessness that is admirable.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This film may seem a work of fiction to some, but look around and see the similarities in today's news. Undoubtedly this film is destined to become a cult film for those who draw on history and see parallels.  Brilliant acting and cinematography. Natalie Portman is exquisite in this role. Hugo Weaving's passion is undeniable as  V.  One should check the history of Guy Faulkes.
1400064287|2.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I enjoyed it so much I almost bought their 'argument' until I realized it was nothing but empty fluff and repackaged common sense, but avoids any in depth insights. Its like a book about how so succeed in business said 'work hard and be honest'.  well that's good advice, but is that the whole story?  Nor do they ever use an example of truly challenging idea (just politically correct, safe ones) that have broken boundaries and REALLY challenged the status quo.     the book is much like Malcolm Gladwell's book (whom the authors admire) - almost designed to bring the authors lucrative speaking fees from big corporations but avoiding anything really controversial or challenging. They just re-enforce ideas we're comfortable with.       I went to the books website and posted a couple of comments on some of the authors posts - nothing nasty or inflammatory - just challenging some of their ideas. The comments were quickly deleted. I suspect the same thing has happened here.  So are the authors using the same tactics they advocate? Or other methods to spread their ideas? Like suppressing ones that challenge theirs?
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|I'll keep this short since there are many reviews concerning the content of the movie itself. This review is for the DVD.    Side A: 2-D in full screen and wide screen    I have no complaints here. The movie looks good and is still simple family fun no matter which version you prefer.    Side B: 3-D in wide screen    Here's my problem with this DVD as it compares to the theater experience. Most who watched it in the movies in 3D will be let down. The movie is a good movie, but not good enough to own. It was the 3D gimmick that made it awesome.    Here are the problems:    1. The 3-D effects are not the same as the way you saw it in the movies.  2. The 3-D effects are more like the gimmicky old school red/blue 3-D-ish movies from the old days.  3. And that's what you get, cheap red/green 3-D glasses that makes the movie barely watchable and truly disappointing.  4. I kept the old 3-D glasses from the movie theater hoping that I would be able to enjoy the 3-D coolness on my 47 inch HD LCD TV, instead I get a quasi 3-D gimmick that greatly disappoints.    Conclusion:    If you are buying this DVD for the simple pleasure of a fun family movie then by all means get it, but if you were expecting some 3-D fun then do not buy it. It will only disappoint you.
031606792X|1.0|Stephenie Meyer's ideas aren't necessarily the problem -it's her writing. Not only has Meyer failed to expand her vocabulary to prevent using the same adjectives continually, but she continues to construct meaningless conversations between characters that doesn't progress the plot in any shape or form. These meaningless and shallow conversations continue for a couple of hundred pages indicating that perhaps most of this novel is padding as the author is slightly lost at sea without quite knowing how to construct a novel. This is nothing unusual as Meyer has struggled with plot and pacing throughout her previous novels but never to this dire extent. In Meyer tradition most of the novel is taken up by irrelevant conversations and a day-by-day description of what the characters have been doing. These conversations involve characters doing a lot of whispering, laughing and chuckling at every comment - even the serious ones, and describing the colour of everyones eyes continually. Similarly to her previous works, the real plot begins to unfold during the last few chapters and if you blink, you will essentially miss it.      There were some good ideas here, although none are original ones. Renesmee could really have been developed further and could have been quite a complex character who is both good but with vicious tendencies. The difficulty I had was with characterisation. I can see how both Bella and Edward are simple archetypes in which adolescent girls can project themselves. The difficulty is that Bella's simple characterisation here is not consistent with her previous behaviour. In fact, none of the characters behave in concordance with their previously established views. Bella quickly changes her mind about marriage and motherhood without any reason whatsoever. She is willing to die for a hybrid human-vampire child that is killing her and in which she has no chance of survival unless she becomes immortal. Similarly her father doesnt want to know anything aboutvampirism or what has happened to his daughter and basically is unconcerned about her wellbeing. If I was turned into part of the un-dead legion, I'm sure my family would notice and be more than a little concerned! Bella's mother who was previously against the idea of marriage at a young age becomes an advocate for it and Edward, who was unable to procreate since he has no fluid sires a child. Meyer shows a fundamental lack of writing ability as she contradicts her previous works and changes her own universe simply because it suits her to do so. This is not the work of a thoughtful and talented author who overcomes character constraints with creativity and forethought. Throughout the novel Meyer never allows the reader to forget they are reading a piece of fiction. You can almost visualise strings attached to each character as Meyer manipulates them as she chooses on a whim.      My biggest difficulty with the novel was with Jacob imprinting on the child Renesmee. I am not comfortable with an adult character deciding that an infant child will grow up to become their sexual mate. What shocks me is they these children who are 'imprinted' don't have a choice in the matter. Jacob obsessively carries Renesmee everywhere, becomes jealous when her own mother holds her and cannot bear to be apart from the toddler. Somehow this doesnt sit well with me. Although the appeal of Twilight, for me, has always been that the characters are so dysfunctional and exacerbate their own problems that it borders on the amusing, imprinting verges on the obscene. I dont think Meyer is quite aware how co-dependent, psychologically troubled and dysfunctional her characters are. What makes this worse is that Meyer seems genuinely unaware she has created characters who are so unwell. If Meyer did not intentionally create them to be examples of obsession and pathological dependence then she needs to work on characterisation and narrative extensively so she is better able to construct characteraccording to her own designs.       Although the previous novels in the Twilight saga were simply fun, trashy novels by an amateur who was able to tap a market, Breaking Dawn is an embarrassment. It lacks solid characterisation, structure, contradicts previously established continuity, and has a myriad of plot pacing issues. Not all of this should be attributed to Meyer as the editor certainly has a role to assist.
1401309666|3.0|I guess I picked up this book too late as most of what is written seemd fait accompli and some parts seemed to try to make the facts fit the model.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|Bought the album,popped it in and liked it a lot...Have enjoyed the last 3 Pink albums & knew this one had to be good and I was right.It has the trademark ballads,soft pop rockers and a little r&b...I like when an artist,especially an artist like Pink, mixes it up...She has impressed me with her attitude and writing talent.I pretty much enjoyed all the songs,but my standout faves are...So What,Sober,I Don't Believe You,Please Don't Leave Me,Funhouse,Mean & It's All Your Fault.If you like Pinks style and past releases,there is no reason to stop.Go get this one and continue with Pink on her hit parade...
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The movie is excellent.  It is a toned down reminder of the evil a state can perpetrate against individuals and a nation once absolute power is attained. It also illustrates that a police state can only succeed when it has accomplices in the population at large and in the media that controls access to the truth. I marveled at the efficiency of the Stasi and their system of obtaining and maintaining information on East German citizens. Imagine what could be done with today's technology to spy on and control citizens. Ultimately, the Stasi files themselves attest to the failure of communism/socialism. The files document those who were complicit in the Stasi evil while also documenting those unsung heroes that continued to yearn and work for freedom up to the point that they just disappeared in the night.  Sadly, it seems that only those that have lived under the yoke of totalitarianism can truly appreciate the freedoms we American's take for granted.  Today, as we see American citizens vilified in the press for taking contrary positions, or as we view the efforts of those in academia to indoctrinate rather that teach, one must ask, how much longer before the truth police will be knocking on our doors.
1416594884|2.0|I must admit, I did not make it through this book. I did give a honest try and well, it just did not hold me. The story started out interestingly enough but information about characters, their motivations, and their interrelations are doled out with a eyedropper and the plot proceed's at snail's pace. I lost interest and eventually decided, life's too short. Of course others will disagree. I have not read any other Le Carre books but was aware of the name and the genre in which he has made a very successful career. Not for me, what else can I say?
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|The title of this CD truly lives up to its name, it really is the best damn thing, in this case, the best damn disk. All Avril Lavigne fans should enjoy this 3rd installment of Avril's recording CD's. It rocks hard and has plenty of what Avril fans would hope for. Avril Lavigne is a real talent and true musician/writer, and it shows on this disk.    5 stars from me, a true Avril Lavigne fan.
B000002MZ9|5.0|I'll start out by saying that I am huge fan of both Neil Young and Pearl Jam so for me this is a match made in heaven. My, I would love to see these two legends perform together (they did tour it briefly in Europe in 1995). The musicianship of PJ along with the song writing and signature voice of Neil combine to make this a must own for fans of either. My personal favorites include \\"Act of Love\\", \\"Scenery\\" (I think I can listen to that song all day!!!), and \\"I am the Ocean.\\" This album sounds very raw, is under-produced (as much of Neil's electric work is) and was recorded over a short period of time. This is fine by me, exactly what it should be, and then legend (Young) recording with soon-to-be legends (PJ). Magic!
0060775858|1.0|According to my mom I loved this book when I was a baby. She thinks that the one I had was all color and more vibrant than this edition. Half of the pages of this new edition are black and white. Very uninspiring. Out of 100+ books that my 17 month old son has, this is his least favorite. I read it to him a few times but his eyes seemed to glaze over with boredom (in a way it's actually kind of cool to see him discriminate between good and bad \\"literature\\"). Now it is gathering dust.
0439023483|5.0|This amazing book has gained a coveted spot on my top shelf of reading.  If i didnt like grouping my books together by story, then the Hunger Games would be in the number two postion right behind Twilight.    I had read alot of reviews on the book before i finally broke down and bought it, i wasnt even sure i would enjoy it, but man was i wrong.    The hunger games is a thrilling suspense ride that keeps you balancing on the edge of life and death with its main character Katniss.   This book is so enthralling, so inviting you feel like your right there next to all the character as they fight for there lifes and sometimes for eachothers. After i read this book i went to sleep knowing i was going to dream about the hunger games and sure enough i did, i actually woke up disorintated and checked my husbands pulse to make sure he was still alive. [he was....lol]       You cant easily forget the Hunger games once you'v read it   and the desire to know what happens next is about as strong as the desire to survive in the GAMES.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|This is well worth the buy - its HD quality is absolutely amazing throughout most of the movie...You can see a hair on the model of Jack's skull when he's approaching the door to Christmas Town - now that's clarity! It is likely that you will never see this movie in a better presentation..That is until something better than Blu-ray comes out. Every quality of the movie is pushed to the edge with Blu-ray..It is simply fantastic!

0767817664|1.0|When I've read and have heard all these positive reviews for this gigantic turkey I just can't believe my eyes or ears! I mean has anybody even read any of the comic books?! Well I have and FYI they were a lot more clever than this trash. I just don't see that this movie took any cues from the comic nor is it even as well written!! The cheesey attempts at humor were completely embarrassing as jokes/humor(if You call it that) felt like it was written by a 12 year old!! The comics that I read for Fright Night didn't meddle in worthless jokes and in general made them poignant. It wasn't just about dumb laughs for no real reason such as this turd of a movie possessed. I found William Ragsdale's performance as Charlie Brewster to be dorky! And needless to say he was alot better on Herman's Head. Chris Sarandon was not only very inconsistant in his laughable performance as vampire Jerry Dandridge but he was neither funny nor clever! To say nothing of that scene where one moment he's telling Charlie Brewster that he would give him a chance to forget all about him and what he knows then the next he's strangling him while trying to push him out the window. My gosh are they sure this is a comedy? 'Cause that was a crude moment. Anyway I liked Chris alot better in Child's Play a few years later. Amanda Bearse in a Pre-Married With Children role as Charlie's love interest was a forgivable enough performance despite her not giving it her all! Whoever that really annoying dork was that played Ed/Evil Ed he was just too unbearable and not very funny. The only thing he did that would even remotely pass as funny was his poor attempt to try and fly out a window appearing to fall. I'm sorry but there just isn't any excusing this bucket of vomit at all! Needless to say Roddy McDowell should just stick with Planet of the Apes! He just tried too hard in his half-a**ed performance as Peter Vincent. Anyhoo if you want to see a real vampire comedy I recommend you try Vampire in Brooklyn,Once Bitten, or even My Best Friend's a Vampire and stay away from this eye cancer on celluloid all together!

B0016QNSFQ|4.0|There are obvious paralles between Derek Jarman and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Both were prodigys and both were homosexuals who struggled to make sense of themselves in a world that either did not acknowledge that homosexual culture existed or vilified it. And both were iconoclasts in their respective mediums who were nonetheless obsessed with religious themes and reading their own lives within the context of traditional culture. But there the parallels end for temperamentally the two are absolutely incommensurable. Wittgenstein is a humorously irreverent child prodigy but a humorless adult. Lucky for us Jarman keeps the child version of Ludwig around as a kind of ludic spirit to lighten the gloomy load that is always weighing on the adult Ludwig's joyless mind. Cleverly, Jarman has everyone except the joyless adult Ludwig wear primary colors and act as if nothing at all weighed on their clever Cambridge minds.<br /><br />The primary relationships and philosophic pursuits of Ludwig's life are briefly explained and explored. The Cambridge set ( represented here by philosopher Bertrand Russell, gay economist John Maynard Keynes, and haughty Bloomsbury socialite Lady Ottoline) are drawn to the Viennese genius and enjoy having him around even though he is for all intents and purposes socially dysfunctional. In fact this philosopher of language is such a poor communicator that he makes a disasterously poor professor. When Bertrand tells Ludwig that his students imitate his behavior it seems ambiguous as to whether Russell means that they mock Wittgenstein's  aristocratic and effette mannerisms or affectionately appropriate them. Its also not clear if this means that Ludwig has made it fashionable to be gay at Cambridge. All of these meanings seem to be suggested but the latter one seems to be the one that Jarman wants to stress without spelling it out (this was made for BBC television after all). It is clear that Jarman is interested in telling gay history here and as such Ludwig would fit into the gay-man-who-cannot-accept-himself-as-gay-man subject position which is doubly sad since the young Ludwig was so proudly and fearlessly anti-normal. As a result of this self-loathing all of Ludwig's relationships (including his relationship with philosophy) are of the love/hate variety. Jarman makes it clear that it was his ascetic nature, his love of clarity and purity, that made him such a groundbreaking philosopher; and he also makes it clear that it was this love of purity that made his self-hatred all the more intense. But, again, Jarman keeps things light. One never feels the heaviness of the actual life as Wittgenstein himself must have felt it. You can judge for yourself whether this is an achievment or an evasion.<br /><br />In addition to the tragic nature of Wittgenstein's personal story, Jarman is also interested in drawing parallels between the fin de sielce zeitgeist of Ludwig's suicide rampant Vienna and the fin de siecle zeitgeist of his own AIDS rampant London. These contextual parallels would probably have been more fully explored had this been a full blown feature film and not simply a one-hour made for BBC production. As a result this is more like an appetizer than a full meal. But, given the scarcity of Jarman projects, it is savored for what it is.<br /><br />Ideally, I think Foucault (who was as playful as Jarman when it came to dissecting the systems that order us about) would have been a better match for this director. But its an oddly appealing film nonetheless.<br /><br />Ironically, Wittgenstein is known for enabling us to see language as a game not with a singular set of rules but with as many sets of rules as there are speech communities. This breakthrough proved to be liberating for many artists and thinkers (Foucault among them who has shed much light on the way discourses shape identity) that followed in his wake, but Wittgenstein himself (tied as he was to the dominant discourse of conventional morality) neverseemes to have experienced this breakthrough as liberatory.nced this breakthrough as liberatory.

0321525655|5.0|Garr Reynolds is a former Manager of WW User Group Relations at Apple Computer, and is a currently a Marketing and Multimedia Presentation Design at Kansai Gaidai University in Japan.<br /><br />In this \\"How-to\\" book, Presentation Zen, Garr offers a fresh teaching approach to presentation design. Garr organizes his book into three sections Preparation, Design and Delivery. Within these sections Garr stresses Clarity, Simplicity and Naturalness.<br /><br />He cautions not to begin writing your presentation in PowerPoint, and instead to get out a notepad or scratch paper and jump into the creative process feet first. Imagine Shakespeare writing Romeo & Juliet in PowerPoint slides, it would have proved creatively impossible. Before digitizing your presentation, write it down on paper, yellow post-its, or a whiteboard. Generate a lot of ideas and then cut away the unnecessary information, then prioritize and organize your main points.<br /><br />Garr also stresses not to \\"Data Dump\\" or simply paste entire excel sheets full of figures into a PowerPoint slide. Instead Garr asks readers to crunch the numbers first, consider the implications and wider relations and sum up the conclusion on each slide. He points out that the slide is not the place for you to walk the audience through a detailed walk through a process, that is better left to an actual printed document with deep explanation. Rather every slide should state a conclusion, a key takeway that the presenter can expand upon during the presentation.<br /><br />A worthwhile investment to enhance your presentation skills.
0743455967|5.0|I don't even read Stephen King books. I don't like horror books as I have nightmares - but I know Stephen is a writing legend so this book was fantastic to read.<br /><br />He writes in that \\"real person\\" way that makes you feel he is not some writing super-hero that just creates a bestseller out of nothing. He is to the point in his advice, but behind it is his story. How he and Tammy came from nothing, how his drug use crushed him, and how his accident changed the way he sees the world. He knows the power of story.<br /><br />Some top pieces of advice from the book:<br /><br />- Close your door and make a serious commitment to write. Don't wait for the muse to come. Show up every day and \\"sooner or later, he'll start showing up, chomping his cigar and making his magic\\"<br /><br />- Write what you love to read. Don't write in a genre to make money.<br /><br />- If you don't have time to read, you don't have time to write.<br /><br />- He writes by finding some characters and then putting them in a situation. They often surprise him by what happens.<br /><br />- Write your first full draft with no input. Then let it rest for 6 weeks or so \\"like bread dough between kneadings\\". You will find it much easier to kill your darlings after a rest<br /><br />- Revise for length. 2nd draft = 1st draft - 10%<br /><br />- \\"Do you need someone to make you a paper badge with the word \\"Writer\\" on it before you can believe you are one? God, I hope not.\\"<br /><br />Great book!
0609610570|4.0|This book teaches that `Execution' is not just tactics - it is a discipline and a system. Former CEO of Allied Signal (now Honeywell) Larry Bossidy and top business consultant and author Ram Charan bring decades of experience to the subject of Execution. Together they stress that to be successful, execution must be built into a company's strategy, its goals, and its culture.<br /><br />One of the pillars of the book is that Execution is a systematic way of exposing reality and acting on it. Bossidy and Charan state that most companies don't face reality well, and state that unless you translate big thoughts into concrete steps for action, they're pointless. Execution becomes the missing link between aspirations and results. To be successful, strategies must take into account the organization's ability to execute.<br /><br />The book Execution states, \\"In an execution company's operating review, the leader will want to know if the goal is realistic. \\"Fine, but will the increase come from? What products will generate the growth? Who will buy them, and what pitch are we going to develop to those customers? What will the competitor's reaction be?\\" If a milestone hasn't been reached at the end of the first quarter, it's a yellow light: something's not going as planned, and something will need to be changed. \\"Are the right people in charge of getting it done? Is their accountability clear? Whose collaboration is required and how will they be motivated to collaborate? Will the reward system motivate them toward a common objective?\\" The leader does not just sign off on a plan. She wants an explanation, and she will drill down until the answers are clear. \\"What are the programs? Where is the money going to be saved? What's the timeline? How much is it going to cost us to achieve it? And who is responsible for it all?\\"<br /><br />Optimism, motivation and realism are keys to success.<br /><br />Bossidy & Charan's First Building Block of Execution: 1. Know your people and your business 2. Insist on realism 3. Set clear goals and priorities 4. Follow through 5. Reward the doers 6. Expand people's capabilities 7. Know yourself<br /><br />\\"Execution\\" contends that leaders who execute focus on a very few clear priorities that everyone can grasp. Give people a small number of clear priorities to execute well. A leader who has \\"ten top priorities\\" doesn't know what he's talking about - he doesn't know himself what the most important things are. Have few, clearly realistic goals and priorities that will influence the performance of the department.<br /><br />The book highlights the importance of simplicity, stating that Leaders who execute speak simply and directly. A key takeway in the book is to simplify things so that others can understand them, evaluate them, and act on them. The authors rigorously promote that Execution is a systematic process of rigorously discussing hows and whats, questioning, tenaciously following through, and ensuring accountability.m 3.

B001E7OO2I|4.0|I Love John Legend and I Love this album. I've been a fan of his since his first album \\"Get Lifted\\" when he introduce us to the single \\"Ordinary People\\". He's a musical genius, and he's definitely on his way to becoming a musical icon. The 1st single \\"Green Light\\" is uptempo with some psychodelic twang to it. It just makes you want to shake your butt. The second track \\"It's Over featuring Kanye West\\" has a throw back vibe to it,like your back in high school chillin' out with your crew. The track \\"No Other Love featuring Estelle\\" is funky. I Love it. My favorite track on the album would definitely have to be \\"Good Morning\\". It's about a man waking up next to the Love of his life and just wanted those few extra moments just to look at her. To be with her. To hold her. To kiss her. There's funk, there's jazz, a little rock, a little hip-hop, and ofcourse Mr. Legend doing what he does best. Making Love to the ivory(piano). You got to Love that.
B000NOQDOA|3.0|My husband and I bought this a month ago for our 20 month old daughter and installed it in our 2005 Tahoe.  It looks great.  It's very simple and a very nice design compared to all the ugly bags we tried to install that either hung to low or looked cheesy.  I want to give this 5 stars more than anything but I simply can't because the plastic holders are incredibly flimsy/cheap.  We have already broken 2 with no abuse.  I do have an e-mail into the company to see how to buy replacement parts.  If replacement parts aren't available then we'll have a problem because I wouldn't spend $42.00 on another one unless they upgrade the plastic holders.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|I took my 4-year-old nephew to see this over the weekend because he too saw the commercials and has been dying to see it. He's at an age where he's really into cars, as well as fire engines and trains, and I thought this was right up his alley. I was right. He loved it. It was fast, it was exciting and it was fun for kids. Speed's little brother Sprital and his pet chimp Chim-Chim cracked up every kid in the theater and I have to admit they were pretty funny. The scene where Sprital is offered all the candy he wants made every kid laugh hard. It was creative in ways I would never think of and interesting for both kids and adults. There was a nice little message about family and integrity too. The portrayal of young Speed and his love of racing and his older brother was excellent. One of the best quiet little parts was when lil' Speed gets picked up from school by his big brother, in the Mach 5! What kid wouldn't love that? I don't get why people are saying there is no heart in this movie. It has plenty. I ended up liking the Racer family more in this movie than I ever did in the cartoon. While there are a couple of fight scenes they are more action-y than violent or vicious. Again, Sprital and Chim-Chim leaven the fights with humor. I don't know why the critics have their undies in a bunch over this one. It's plenty entertaining.<br /><br />Anyhow, check out this movie for no other reason than you get to see a chimp de-pants a ninja

0060555661|5.0|The Intelligent Investor is a dense, informative, comprehensive, and quite difficult textbook that will reward diligent study with a depth of knowledge that would be hard to find elsewhere.<br /><br />That Warren Buffet, at the age of nineteen, was able to appreciate the wisdom imparted by Benjamin Graham in this book, is as much a tribute to Buffet's intellect as it is to the clarity of the text.<br /><br />Originally published in 1950, the book is in its fourth revised edition originally published in 1973, and brought up to date for the twenty-first century by copious footnotes by Jason Zweig.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the diligent intelligent investor.

0446579939|5.0|Nicholas Sparks comes through again. Having read all his novels, I must rank The Lucky One as one of his best right behind Bend in the Road. Wonderfully conceived story with a few messages for us. His dialogs improve each time and the drama mixed with romance is amazing. I really felt for the characters in this story. NS interjects sarcasm and humor at just the right times. I think pages 153-163 (on Elizabeth's brother's birthday) contain some of the most dramatic writing NS has produced so far. The words jump out from the pages and lead us on a beautiful path to an excellent ending. I will be rereading NS prior books while I wait for his next book. If you enjoyed this book, try Spencerville by Nelson DeMille it's The Lucky One with a PG rating.

0375826726|5.0|Well, finally an author has had the courage to bring morality into the blood and guts of the fantasy fiction genre. Other writers from Tolkien (LOTR) to MacAffrey(sp?) (Pern) to Rowling (Harry Potter) have given only lip service to the moral intelligence and values that fantasy heroes could have. Of course, war is not pretty, but haven't we had enough of the blood and sweat. Now isn't it time for the tears? Congratulations to Paolini for making Eragon one who seriously questions the moral issues of war, killing, torture, etc. And I agree with including the dwarf politics, too. Politics is the necessary foundation for democracy as Jefferson, Franklin and Adams fortunately understood. I also like that the author has greatly expanded the concept of magic far beyond the shallow cleverness in Harry Potter.<br /><br />As Lewis Bernstein, the Producer of Sesame Street said once: \\"Life doesn't exist in most places like it does on Sesame Street, but if we don't model it, it will never exist.\\" Why can't the fantasy genre model the moral values that we are hoping to instill in our future generations.<br /><br />I am enjoying this series as Paolini matures in his writing and hopefully will continue to include moral intelligence in his character development.<br /><br />Note: I agree that Paolini uses far too many obscure, multi-syllable, long, uncommon, and unnecessary  adjectives, but at least he gives us some context with which to understand their meaning. Try The Scarlet Letter if you want even more picturesque writing.

0765316897|5.0|I love this book and this series.  If you're a fan of Wheel of Time, you're probably going to love Mistborn.  Plenty of action and warfare on top of an interesting plot and well-developed characters makes this series one of my favorites.  Sure, it's not the most intellectually complex series (that's not to say that it's not interesting and deep), but it's very fun and very interesting and I enjoy it and look forward to more from Sanderson.

0441013597|5.0|With over 1,000 reviews posted on Amazon.com and an overall rating of -4 ½ Stars- I guess there's not a lot left to be said about the late Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi book `Dune'.  It has been at least 30 years since I sat down with this book and to this day it still remains one of the most original, enthralling, visionary and mystical novels I've ever had the pleasure to read.<br /><br />This was truly a novel way ahead of its time. Back then I was primarily fascinated with the elements of mysticism that permeated the story; Paul's visions, the ancient prophecies, the Bene Gesserit, the spice and of course the great sandworms. However now in the light of the world as it exists in the 21st century I clearly see the author's keen foresight at work. His environmental concerns pertaining to ecosystems and the scarcity of water, as well as the foreboding of an impending, universal Jihad bring his story to life in ways unimaginable forty years ago. Maybe he was really Frank Herbert the prophet, not Frank Herbert the author?
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I read about thirty books a year, most of them sci-fi, for the technology exploration and the fact that I grew up with Star Wars. The writing is usually crap and the the themes are lame, but I deal with it. Once in a while, you find a sci-fi book that challenges the little philosophical nut in your brain as well giving you a wonderful read. This is one of them.
B001DHXT1G|1.0|Knowing all the wrong that went with Ang Lee's version you would think this one would rival the 1st Spiderman in story, acting and special effects... but no. The whole movie basically is the last 20 minutes of the film and we are left with the front of it having Banner in a wild goose chase all over Southern America! Such a waste. I could have written such a more explosive story from beginning to end on just one of the thousands of great comic book episodes from Stan Lee who looks so pitiful in all his cameos in his franchises films. How dare he OK this BS. The same goes for Lou Ferrigno who is always a petty security guard. They should have let him have so much more dialogue as the voice of The Hulk ala \\"Puny Humans! Hulk Smash!!\\" and so much more. The Hulk is such a wimp in this and the only thing they actually got right was \\"The Abomination\\" character which like I said doesn't rear his head until the final 20 minutes. No matter how strong they made him The Hulk should have taken him to school in strength, anger and sheer aggression(The madder he gets the stronger he gets!) but instead we see him hesitant, passive and unsure in times where it is most valid for him to lose control. I liked how lean they made him this time around but I think he should have been way more muscular and a little taller(if he was 10ft they should have made him 12 just like The Abomination).One of the only things that I liked about what he did while being Hulk was when he came up with the idea to split the police car in two and used them as boxing gloves to whoop on The Abomination. So Cool!! Other than that, back to the drawing board. Supreme stinker!!!!!!!!!!! F- because I know they had the right budget to make something way better. Shame on you Marvel!
0767817664|5.0|***********  Warning:  Spoilers  *******************    Fright Night is by far one of the best scary movies ever made.  The characters, plot and imagery are very easy to follow, and the gore is not something out of the \\"Saw\\" movies.  That said, this movie has some great humor in it as well.    First and foremost, the storyline is very original.  We have an ordinary boy named Charlie who seems to lead a life that most of us know.  High school.  Girlfriend.  Homework.  Beat up car.  But wait, what's this?  A new neighbor has moved into the old house next door, and he is carrying a coffin into his basement???    The characters are so interesting to watch.  I especially like the sophisticated and devilish nature of Jerry Dandridge, and I know how evil this dangerously deceptive person is.  I see them all the time, especially in the democrat party.  Our heroes are strong-willed and determined to save the day, and I really like the dynamic of Charlie and Peter working together to destroy the neighborhood vampire.  Poor Amy is caught in the middle of good and evil, and Ed completely turns on his friends.    The humor is great, and I love the scene where Amy pushes a hamburger into Charlie's face for ignoring her.  I am fairly certain that some men can relate to this type of treatment from their women.  It was funny, and there are other moments of levity as well.     Yeah, it's got some violence in it.  I mean, we are talking about a vampire that kills people, so of course the good guys have to kill him in order to save the innocent people.    All in all, it's a fun movie to watch, and it's not too scary.

B000IYV1ME|5.0|Syriana is a great movie about what goes on behind the scenes in the corporate/political world and it shows how everyone, politician, military, intelligence, royalty, blue collar worker, media...is connected somehow.     I watched this movie 4 times and the more I watched it, the more \\"clues\\" I gathered. This really isn't a movie where you can watch once and forget about it. This is NOT an action thriller.    The movie was made in a collarge way to show how the world is a complex web of simultaneous activity. Each \\"piece\\" is held together by a well-known actor: Clooney (CIA scenes), Damon (analysis & the \\"good\\" royalty), Cooper (corporate), Language (desperate workers) etc... Without them, it would be impossible to navigate through the movie.     Anyway, this movie is not for rental. Buy it, watch it 3 or 4 times and think about it.

B000Y7U98C|3.0|I love a good sci-fi flick (it's been a while since we had one) and had heard good things about this movie.  The first half was very good, really had me looking forward to seeing where Danny Boyle (the director) was going with this.  Unfortunately I was quite disappointed by the last 20 to 30 minutes of the movie.  Not only did he go the 'slasher flick' route to some extent, he also threw in some cerebral stuff which instead of adding to the movie, just had me scratching my head (several times near the end I was just confused as to what the heck was happening...never a good sign).  Even in the most complex Star Trek movie (or in Kubrick's 2001, an obvious precursor to this flick), you had SOME idea of what was going on, etc.  This was just confusing for the sake of being confusing.  Again, I thought 3/4 of the movie was engrossing, well acted, and interesting...maybe you should skip the last 20 minutes and make up your own ending!
1416575464|4.0|When I received the Domino Book of Decorating I was instantly pleased with the beautiful cover.  This book is sturdy and one that you'll be picking up from your coffee table quite a bit.      You are given decorating tips by room and there is something for everyone.  My own personal dilemma with the room by room tips is how to have a sense of togetherness within the decorating and not have each room look like it's for a different house.  But again that's me personally, there may be others who appreciate that characteristic.  That's where this book comes in.  I would recommend it.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|This film is deep.  You slow down in this film and watch Wall-E in his world.  There is not a lot of dialogue which is a really interesting dynamic.  I highly enjoyed the film and fell for the cute robot.  This is a love story and is very sophisticated.

1594489505|3.0|The Kite Runner is a once in a lifetime novel that touches both your heart and soul. Hosseini's follow-up, A Thousand Splendid Sun, was a bit of a disappointment to me. Although the novel offers much that is interesting, it never seems to reach its full potential.    The book is separated in three acts. In the first, a young woman sees her mother die. Her father has disowned her so she is sent off to marry a much older man in the hopes that she will provide him with a son, a thing she is never able to do. In the second act, a young girl is trapped in Kabul during the war. Although she grows up happy, the war destroys her existence and soon, she also finds himself married to the older man in order to try and provide him with a son. In the final act, both women try to run away from their problems, from their abusive husband and from the horrors of the war.    I loved the sections of the book that described a world I'm not familiar with. The country's customs, the way these characters act and think were all very different to me. But I couldn't relate to any of these characters. None are likeable. I wish I could have cared more about the two heroines. Instead, I never really did.    I think the book also suffers from the fact that it was written in three parts. During most of the second part, the entire first act is forgotten, only to be brought back in the third. I wanted to go back to the earlier character. Intermittent chapters like in the third section should have been the rule of the game for the entire book.    It's not that Hosseini has written a bad book. It's just that this one is a lot like other stories of this kind we've seen before. And the moment something becomes interesting, the author skips to something different. This doesn't create suspense, but it does annoy the reader somewhat. Maybe I was expecting too much out of this novel.

Story line is great, the music is even better and for people who never did acting before, they did quite well in this movie. Buy it and I promise you that you won't regret it or at least check it out first somehow but it's worth owning.
1904233023|5.0|I read a lot, and this is a book I can always come back to and I love it all over again.  Even though it is an older book, it feels like it was written for our times.  The desks are computers in the school, for example.  I keep giving books to friends and family with diverse reading tastes, and they all love it so much that they won't give it back. If you are looking for a book that teaches heart, bravery, honesty, integrity, what it means to work as a team, and how to overcome adversity. . .you've found your book. It is simply amazing!
1595141715|5.0|I am a high school English teacher and I found Thirteen Reasons Why to be as riveting as the Jodi Picult novel about the school shooting. Both deal with school problems of bullying and both made me stop and think about what I may or may not see during the school day. The book is a quick read and one that is hard to put down once you begin it so make sure you start it on a day when you have ample time to read.<br /><br />The organization of the 13 messages made the book suspenseful to read because I wondered who was going to be next and each message seemed to carry a different theme. The various chapters would work will in a Literture Group book discussion and cover the usual YA topics in books, but in a different manner. In some ways, the organization reminded me of the 13 Little Blue Envelopes book, although the content is quite different.<br /><br />The book is also a good read for counselors or mental health professionals who are dealing with students who fight drug/alcohol problems. Anyone who is working with at-risk students know that suicide is not a topic to be ignored.<br /><br />The signs were present, but no one seemed to \\"get\\" Hannah's message or to reach out to her. One of the most critical reviews here said that she was a whiny girl who never wanted help from others, but that is not how I read it. I read it and saw her as one of those invisible people that we see but don't see, maybe if some of the people she left messages for after the fact had been a little more observant before there wouldn't be a book?<br /><br />The date rape issue could be controversial, but overall I think that most of the spin off questions could be awesome. This has been the most popular book among student at my school this fall and numerous students have asked me if I have read it. Fortunately, I attended a book seminar given by Deborah Hipes last spring and discovered the book there. I read it last summer and discussed it with another English teacher and it is one of our choice recreational reading books this year. It has been a joy to review it. I wish I enjoyed all the YA books I read half this much.his year. It has been a joy to review it. I wish I enjoyed all the YA books I read half this much.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is a terrific combo -- the classic movie itself on one disc, and the other disc that documents the battle over the movie, led by William Randolph Hearst. I used both discs in my Mass Comm class to show graphically the power of the press and films. Highly recommended.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I was so excited when this special edition came out, I bought it right away. As I did with many other old faves. I might as well have been sitting in the theatre, wasting all of my popcorn and soda on the commercials and previews. By the time the main feature finally comes on, I am out of snacks and I have to pee. I will always love this movie, and the extra \\"where are they now\\" was cool. But you can find out where they are now by going online. Seriously, as another reviewer suggested, buy the original cut if you don't own this movie yet.

B001CZJKS0|1.0|First off, let me state I've always loved Anchor Bay as a company since they first started releasing some of the most hard to find horror titles around that some of us would have never seen. When they announced they were coming out with a 30th Anniversary Edition, I almost fell out of my chair.  With that said, this 30th Anniversary Box Set of Halloween is one of their lowest points in the company's history. It seems they wanted to re-release the SE Halloween some time ago (they watch Ebay also and noticed the ridiculous prices consumers were paying for it) but didn't want to give it away for the $15-$20 it should command.  So then they decided to throw in the 2 movies they have rights to (to boost up the price).  Add a BR version (which was coming out anyway) and a flimsy mask and they have their price ($50).  In these hard financial times, a $50 box set (which isn't even complete) should be boycotted at all costs. This is the same marketing tactics used on the releases of Grindhouse (\\"let's make 2 separate DVDs of both movies\\") and The Reanimator (\\"let's re-release the same DVD every 5th year\\"). MESSAGE TO ANCHOR BAY: If you don't have anything new to add to a DVD or Box Set, leave it alone! If you can't get the rights to the other Halloweens, don't make another Box Set. The only thing you can add to another Halloween release is the \\"found footage\\" or the Producer's Cut of H6.  If you can't get the rights  of any of these, DO NOT RE-RELEASE THIS MOVIE AGAIN!!

B000003EPN|5.0|Originally posted on my music review blog.  Check my profile if you are interested.<br /><br />Note that this review was written of the later reissue, so my comments on the sound may not be applicable.  That edition is here- [[ASIN:B000BBOU2W Verdi: Rigoletto]]<br /><br />---<br />'Rigoletto' has had many excellent recordings over the years.  In the beginning of the LP era, it was one of the first complete operas produced, with the incomparable Leonard Warren in the title role.  When stereo emerged, each label dutifully churned out its own star-studded 'Rigoletto,' featuring such luminaries as Ettore Bastianini, Carl Bergonzi, Joan Sutherland, and the like.  And this trend has continued to the present.  'Rigoletto' is one of the strongest warhorses of the recorded repertoire and will likely continue to be.  Yet, surprisingly, in almost every recording of the opera, there is some obvious weak link.<br /><br />Not so here.  In Robert Merrill, we have the most glorious baritone voice of the postwar period--a dark and resonant instrument with ringing top notes and an unfailing sense of legato.  Often criticized for `just singing' and not adequately portraying his characters, Merrill's performance here sweeps all such criticisms aside. His scenes with Gilda are tender, warm, and affectionate--entirely contrary to his nasty antics at the court of Mantua.  Then witness his 'Cortigiani' and 'Si, Vendetta,' in which he unleashes his voice in righteous, paternal fury.  And the moment when his daughter dies is crushing, not in the voice of a pathetic and deformed clown, but as a man overcome by grief in failing his greatest duty. To him, the hunchbacked jester is an almost noble character, twisted into viciousness by his infirmity.  More than any other singer who has portrayed Rigoletto, he is utterly believable as a loving and vengeful father.  It is truly his finest role.<br /><br />Gilda is admirably cast as well.  From a purely musical standpoint, Anna Moffo's Gilda about as good as anyone could expect, with lovely, even tone from top to bottom, a seemingly perfect sense of phrasing, and not the slightest hint of vocal strain.  Luckily, Gilda requires more musical skills than interpretive ones, though Ms. Moffo is not without some insight.  Her 'Caro Nome' is full of girlish longing.  Similarly, her 'Tutte le Feste al tiempo' tugs at one's heart strings in just the right way--she is just so perfectly naïve and angelic, it seems nearly inevitable that someone will murder her.<br /><br />Merrill's Rigoletto and Moffo's Gilda have few if any challengers, but the role of the Duke is another matter.  Most every great tenor has taken a shot at the role, whether he was suited to it or not.  Kraus succeeds admirably, though not without reservations.  Frankly, his main weakness is that his reedy voice is not the equal of Pavarotti or Bj&ouml;rling.  But such comparisons are unfair--on his own terms, Kraus is a perfectly rakish Duke, full style, and may be summarized as an insightful study in shallowness.  He is perhaps the most flippant Duke on record--in 'Ella mi fu Rapita,' his \\"ardent\\" longing for Gilda is expressed in almost irritated terms, like he's lost a toy.  'La donna &egrave; Mobile' is full of verve and swagger, clearly conveying the Duke's irreverent attitude.<br /><br />The chorus is handled very well, and the smaller parts are consistently well cast.  Ezio Flagello's Sparafucile is less illustrious than some (most notably Cesare Siepi), but serves very well, particularly in the final scene.  David Ward is perhaps the best and most convincing Monterone on disc, in sonorous, commanding voice.  And Rosalind Elias is very good indeed, injecting a great deal of character into the otherwise small role of Maddalena.<br /><br />Solti's conducting is very typical of the maestro.  From beginning end, it's loud, blaring hell on wheels, indulging in dynamic extremes and delivered with an orchestral sledgehammer.  In Solti's hands, Verdi'sclaims of serving drama through music are well borne out.  A lighter, more lyrical hand might be preferred in the opening party scene, but otherwise, it serves the taut drama of the opera perfectly.<br /><br />RCA's sonics are brain splitting.  The balance between voices and orchestra is pleasingly theatre-like, so much that the performance sometimes sounds like an unusually good live recording.<br /><br />In all, this is perhaps the most consistent and dramatic reading of 'Rigoletto' ever committed to disc.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />  Rating: Ae out.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|My favorite Ghibli film by far, Porco Rosso is unique among the other works by the studio in achieving the same sense of magic and wonderment while being set firmly in the real world.  There are other enjoyable works set in reality such as My Neighbor the Yamadas or I can Hear the Sea, but the charm in Porco Rosso is grander, at the same time more subtle.    You know those pathetic hollywood action flick commercials? - the ones that say something like \\"this is a hero who can triumph over anything...except his past\\".  Porco Rosso is essentially that, except here we see what happens when the film-maker actually commits to bringing depth to the characters and the world around, instead of making passing references like most hollywood films do.  Porco's past is revealed, almost seductively, over the entire film.    This is a love story that does not directly deal with love.  It lets love happen as the characters live their life.

031606792X|1.0|I felt like Meyer just wanted to fill pages up with this book, and I was sadly disappointed at how crazy this book got!    Spoilers, so watch out:    Honestly, I don't think anyone cared much for the Volturi. I wanted to stop reading the book the moment I found out they were coming to kill them. Seriously, come on. It led to nothing because it was resolved!  I enjoyed the wedding, Edward and Bella's intimate moments (though, I felt that Bella came off as too much of a sex maniac), the part on Jacob and his perspective was a nice change. When I read she was preganant, I was iffy, but I thought, okay okay...    But when I found out more about this kid of hers,  I was done. Are you serious? It grows at super speeds and is somehow half human half vampire, and can already talk and is smarter than the average human AS A BABY? Oh boy...it became a joke. I was no longer eager to finish reading, but I kept going...until... the Volturi. It took me days to get myself to finish up that end of the book, I was so disappointed. Shocked, too. I had read each  book in a day, and it took me several days to get myself through the fourth one.    I was honestly hoping for something new, not the same repetitive scenarios and emotions. I felt like a ghost writer wrote this one...and I wouldn't be surprised if that was the truth.     A disappointment.

006056251X|5.0|This is one of the loveliest historical romances I've ever read. Sebastian is a darling. Indolent, witty and an amoral rake, he constantly surprises himself by his feelings for Evie and his efforts on her behalf. From the beginning he protects and takes care of her. He never mocks her stutters or social clumsiness. The scene where he asks her what it will take for him to get back into her bed is awww-worthy.    Evie is a worthy heroine. Spirited but not foot-stampingly annoying, stubborn but not stupid, she deserves such a great hero. She's a virgin but refreshingly not frightened of sex. Only fear of having her heart broken keeps her from sleeping with Sebastian after their wedding night. This is one of the story's main conflicts and a realistic one, given Sebastian's acknowledged rakishness. Practically she proposes a 3 month period of celibacy for Sebastian to prove himself. Can Sebastian last the 3 months?    The sex scenes are not many but are very sensuous and full of feeling. The sexual tension throughout is superb. Both hero and heroine grow and their HEA is richly deserved. I love this romance!
B001DU8T6S|3.0|Before everyone freaks out, let me just say for the record I am a hardcore Queen fan , and a hardcore Paul Rodgers fan (more of Free than Bad Co.)When \\"Return of the Champions\\" was released , I was very impressed with the combo of these legends coming together and I was looking forward to this new release , so why the three star review?  Actually 3.5, because I was hoping for it to sound more like a Queen album (I know you can't bring or replace Freddie back), but for those who collected Queen albums , you know that each album would have one or two songs each sung by Brian or Roger. And with the exception of say it's not True, this is not the case. This sounds more like a bad co. album with all songs sung by Paul, I just hope that the next release they do will have just that.
0553801503|1.0|Let me start by saying I have not read this book, and I will not read it.  I have read the previous three books and I refuse to keep spending money, time and patience on authors that seem to value money and ego more than providing their readers with good books.

B000GRTREC|1.0|There should be a warning sticker placed on this cd- may lead to violent behavior if forced to listen! I consider myself a very mellow & easy going guy but having the displeasure of hearing this for 2 agonizing hours (they played it twice) at a local bar while shooting pool with friends, after the first 3 tracks I was getting irritated, I couldnt concentrate & was making bad shots, after a 1/2 hour I was beginning to growl and was losing badly (which was unlike me), by the end of the last track me & my friend Mike were plotting to kill the bartender, and when they decided to play the whole frickin' thing over (they wondered why so many people were leaving) I was in such a rage I would have strangled a puppy.<br />I'm really at a loss to why this is so highly praised. Bob has never been a great vocalist (I don't care what people say about his emotion & phrasing) but he was at least listenable in his \\"Nashville Skyline\\"/\\"Knockin on Heavens Door\\" period. Now he just sounds worse, like an old man on his deathbed. I generally wouldn't advocate euthanasia but I might make an exception in Bob's case. This wouldn't be so bad if the music itself was worthwhile. Someone here described the music as not blues, not folk, not country, definately not rock & roll, but lounge music- and I'd have to agree. This is very bland sounding, lacking any musical punch or emotion, the band is way too laid back, merely in the background noodling while Bob goes on & on & on. There's really no noticeble difference in any of these tracks as far as tempo change goes. It's all very maudlin and trite.<br />I've liked a lot of things by Bob over the years, he's a legend who has written so many great songs it's a wonder how he does it. I enjoyed \\"Time Out of Mind\\" although I wouldnt call it great. But \\"Modern Times\\" is a bad album, I dont understand the people who think it's something brilliant. A lot of them are probably old hippies who have warped their minds from too many acid trips. I thought \\"Knocked Out Loaded\\" was more enjoyable than this, and that was widely panned by critics when it came out. It makes me wonder- if Bob had recorded \\"Modern Times\\" as a duet with Yoko Ono would people still praise it?t Loaded\\" was more enjoyable than this, and that was widely panned by critics when it came out.

It sounds good the band is tight,the vocalist is little off but ok. The rest of the band is very good. You have to remember this was made in 1972. And this band were in that same arena with YES, ELP, GENESIS.But for its time I enjoyed this very much. Now you know about Steve Hillage(of GONG),but did you know this is Dave Stewart(keys)that will eventually hook up with Bill Bruford, Allan Holdworth and Jeff Berlin to form the band called Bruford. The CD has many meter changes that make it nice to listen to. They played somewhat \\"outside\\" in the 70's ,but always \\"brought it home\\". Using that ABACAB form. (Wait is'nt there a CD called this! WOW! lol!). Over all worth getting for your collection. Right now with the crap that is coming out now a days,I am listening to these bands like Khan and the new prog bands. Try those too,very refreshing. But this CD is a winner. Get if you can! Very talented players,but it still has that 70's fusion sound,but thats ok with me!

B00192KCQ0|5.0|If you are a metal fan in any way, you must buy this album. It's almost as if Slayer recorded the riffs and James Hetfield put his voice over them for the lyrics. From begining to end, this album resonates what Metallica has been dying to be after the \\"Black\\" album.    Unfortunately for Metallica, they've created such mammoth albums in the past, that when they create a great ablum like this one, you can't compare it to \\"Master Of Puppets\\" or \\"... And Justice For All\\". I think every fan of metal can agree that the best metal albums of all time were Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\" and Metallica's \\"Master Of Puppets\\". Therefore, with that said, \\"Death Magnetic\\" can't be their best album, but it sure ranks up their with their best albums.    This is not the abomination that \\"St. Anger\\" was. This is not the alternative direction that the 90's albums took. \\"Death Magnetic\\" is back to basics of \\"Metallica\\" metal. It performs well. So, if you liked the albums of the 80's, then you'll surely enjoy this album. Heck, a friend of mine was digging listing to the album in my car (he likes old school Metallica only), and he was unaware it was new Metallica until I told him. To not enjoy it probably means you're just a hater of Metallica, and still bitter about the \\"Napster Incident\\".    The album, \\"Death Magnetic\\", is everything great in metal. Just go get the album. Every song is fantastic.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I agree with some on the reviews that yes Anne running around at the end was kind of odd. But the kiss was tender with the tear. Rupert is sex on legs as Captain Wentworth. I would watch the movie 100 times again just to look at him. Sally as Anne was a amazing role. I felt like I understood how torn she was watching her love court someone else. The anticipated climax of their reunion was beautiful. It was what it was and it did not follow the book but the purpose was to make it so it appealed to wider audience. If you want a beautiful love story I would highly recommend watching.
B00005JPO1|1.0|Stunningly awful, on just about every level.  Mirthless, wooden, stupid, dull.  What little in it was all right was not original, and had been done better in previous Indie outings; what little in it was original was depressingly bad.  \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" was one of the greatest movie-going experiences of my life.  This tired, phoned-in, money-grubbing posier is a slimy slap in the face to the \\"Raiders\\" legacy, and an insult to those of us who enjoy screen adventures.  A shameful waste of opportunity.
B000A6T1KE|2.0|Sadly, this last production in the 40 year long original \\"Star Trek\\" continuity turned out to be nothing more than a poor man's remake of \\"Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan\\", seen through the bland prism of the already bloodless Next Generation cast. An unfortunately low note on which to go out, and the only true financial flop in the film franchise.  So far anyway.

B000UFAURI|4.0|Foo Fighters in my opinion took a nose dive previously on \\"In Your Honor\\". Skip two years to 07' and we have another Foo album to submerge ourselves into. Thankfully I managed to really take a liking to this one.<br /><br />The variety of songs is much better then 'IYH', avoiding the categorizing process the last album strained and nit picked to the final bits (to the point you got dry hard rock, or dynamic free acoustic). Echoes eases up an intro, The Pretender, suitable to be \\"Stairway To Heavens\\" alternate take. Once you're comfortable with the chiming guitar, a wall of bricks is bound to hit you in the Foo's universe. Displaying such tight hard rock driven guitar, and overall fantastic musicianship, it could put a grin on ones face. My personal favorite track is \\"Ballad Of The Beaconsfield Miners\\". Interesting burrowing and bouncing up acoustic sounds, and a good story to mold it with. \\"Cheer Up Boys\\" seems like a strike to emos, but in all good humor. \\"Let It Die\\" has already made it to the radio, many believe it's about Kurt Cobain (singer of Grohl's past band Nirvana). Whatever it may be about no question about it being emotional, with a rather rewarding build up.<br /><br /> Overall Foo's have managed to progress and mature while taking steps in the right direction. Studio quality is always great, the music can be relentless, and better yet they trimmed the fat and avoided another mixed bag. Musically it echoes to a time when 90's alternative acts ruled the music terrain, seamlessly silenced the band communicates, two years of patients, and an album that wouldn't dare disgrace us again.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|SPECTACULAR! For my money, this is the definitive Queen concert film, capturing the band at the peak of its musical powers. Its also a film (originally titled \\"We Will Rock You\\") with a long and storied history and with several previous releases - but if you've seen it before, you've never seen it like this! Queen was recently able to acquire the rights to this film and they have overseen its complete top-to-bottom overhaul. The original film elements, shot on 70mm film for the highest quality image, have been completely cleaned, color corrected and restored, re-edited, and the original 24 track audio has been completely remastered and remixed to the band's exacting standards. This means you get a film that has never looked better and never sounded better. The image is gorgeous and looked amazing on my 50\\" HD TV, with great detail, deep blacks and beautiful vivid color courtesy of the band's bold on stage lighting rig. You really have to see it to appreciate just how good the show looks. The audio is breathtaking, with every nuance captured, from Roger Taylor's relentless drums, to John Deacon's thundering bass, from Brian May's crystal clear guitar to Freddie Mercury's glorious, emotive vocals. And the performance is fantastic - fast, furious, energetic, dynamic - with unsurpassed performances of \\"Somebody to Love\\", \\"Save Me\\", \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\", Dragon Attack\\", and the first ever public performance of \\"Under Pressure\\". This is the real deal, folks. This is Queen at their absolute best. And the addition of the Queen set from Live Aid is tremendous to finally have on its own. Perhaps the single best 20 minutes of the band's career, I am thrilled to be able to have it on a single disc.
B000KZGLPS|5.0|As a writer I knew a lot of the tips in this book, but when you're editing its a great book to have.
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|This film is vintage Polanski:  there is little moral certitude, even if you are dealing with Satan, ruthless and evil acolytes, and a con man, expertly acted by Depp.  Instead, you find a coherent and frightening journey of discovery and ambiguity.  Depp is charged with examining the authenticity of some rare books, which is his profession, though he is also an unscrupulous and sleazy near-thief.  As with all great actors, his every gesture exudes his personal confusion, ambition, and cynical humor - a complete personality and even an entire environment.<br /><br />After witnessing a number of alarming crimes, he single-mindedly pursues his task (for which he is handsomely paid) and blithely ignores the destruction and murderous detritus as if walking though an obstacle course.  Along the way, he keeps running into a mysterious and very beautiful woman, who seems to be protecting him, yet also playfully mocking him before disappearing only to reappear in dangerous moments.  Looking not quite human yet vulnerable to injury, she seems to enjoy the evolution of Depp's character in a violent, unpredictable direction.  There is a frightening scene where she annoints him with her blood.  And the book:  the more he discovers, the deeper he gets in becoming almost a direct participant in the antique illustrations in the book, which he scrutinizes as more manuscripts come to light.  Depp's character emerges as something more than he appeared to be, though entirely lacking in simple definition.  It is truly masterful.<br /><br />The most beautiful aspect of the film is the sense - the feeling - of ominous mystery that pervades it.  In other words, there are many clues that must be interpreted, and the viewer never reaches the point of saying, \\"oh, I get it\\", which in lesser films is followed by \\"that's it?\\"  I found this delightfully fascinating and evocative, particularly as much of it takes place in a region similar to the one I currently live in in France.  Typical of Polanski, this elevates the film to a higher art than other occult films, much as Rosemary's Baby did.  The mood of the film is completely consistent and demands (and deserves) the viewer's full attention.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.

B001DDBCV4|5.0|I was looking forward to this movie for a long time.  I saw it in theatres and had to purchase it when it was available on DVD. I have to say I was not disappointed at all.  I loved the movie.  I think it was just as good as the show and I have classified it as one of my all time favorites.  Even my husband who saw it with me, loved it.
B0018D4SHY|5.0|Little Richard very best off!  I fine C/D some of the best rock and roll ever proving there was rock an roll before the guitar. Most of the track use the saxophone in numbers to give that driving beat that drove a generation wide. Younger listeners might not realize that their grannies and granddads jived to this music and that lead the them being here! Put on this C/D and turn up the sound tie down you grandparents down lest they forget them self's and as \\"Bill Haely\\" said rattle them pots and pans.   Most of little Richard's best work is on this C/D. One can hear every one from the rolling stones and the beatles. This might not sound far, just take your pick of music from the fifties to the present day and you'll find an influence that come from this music.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|Well its corny, its colorful and its a fun movie experience. If you like anime, its a lot like that only with people and it is way better than the old cartoon. Very beautiful fun movie that might have you say go speed go!
B0018CWEYY|1.0|look i love this show but let me ask why is it released in every country but here? i know its about the christmas relase so they can make more money. but for petes sake get it together man and relase it in sep or oct. these ppl ruin everything good.
B000005Z0E|5.0|I just don't think Tupac ever had such an important album as this.  Gansta lyrics might have sold the most records ... but this was who this man truly was ... this was knowledge of self.  If you can't appreciate this album then you need to pick up the books and listen to some Farrahkan before you listen to anymore records.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|When I saw this at the theater, I thought it was the best 3-D movie that I have ever seen. If you like amusement parks, this is the movie for you. It's good clean family fun! I was expecting it to be at least as good as Hannah Montana-Best of both worlds 3-D DVD but it blows that movie away. You use Red/Blue Anaglyph glasses for Hannah Montana but for Journey to the Center of the Earth you use Magenta/Green. WOW!!! What a difference on this movie. I tried using the red/blue glasses but they didn't work. I would say the 3-D effects (not talking about color) is as good as it can get without the huge screen. The things that are suppose to pop out at you really do. You can't expect the colors to be great because you are only using two color glasses so the colors won't be as good as the theater...but you don't notice it as much during darker scenes (when they are inside the earth) which is most of the movie. The surround sound was very good even though it does not have the TrueHD audio format...the rear speakers were very engaging. I will say that not everyone does well with 3-D some people get headaches but do those same people get headaches on amusement parks rides...if so this might not be good for you. For me, I love rides if it doesn't spin me around so for this DVD I highly recommend it on blu-ray.    *UPDATE* I now own a Samsung UN46C8000 3D HDTV and Samsung BD-C7900 3D blu-ray player and active shutter glasses...I can't wait until they come out with Journey to the Center of the Earth in real 3D blu-ray because the difference is beyond incredible. Now, I see full color and the clarity is amazing!!!
B001F12J48|3.0|I just bought this thinking that my kids would love watching the trains in 3D as they're all train fanatics.  Unfortunately, the movie just doesn't pull off 3D well in the transfer.  It's a host of double images, poor color saturation, and a whole bunch of other bad things that make the movie difficult to watch.  The best 3D you'll get is on the DVD box-art and I mean that.    I did not own a copy of the movie until this purchase, so I lucked out and the studio didn't double-dip on me.  The good news is that you do get two copies of the movie in the package:  one 3D version (that requires red-blue glasses, 4 are included in the package) and a wide-screen non-3D version.      Movie is fantastic, although a bit creepy at times, but the Christmas-y-ness comes through wonderfully.  I would've rated lower due to the terrible 3D execution(or total lack there-of), but my kids did enjoy the movie (without the 3D)....so that saved it from a 1 star (or even lower if I could!).
B001DU8T6S|4.0|I'm a huge Queen fan.  Always liked Paul Rodgers' voice.  Good combo.  This is a new band.  Don't expect to hear re-hashes of their old stuff.  Elements are there; Brian's guitar, Roger's booming drums, big, choral harmonies & Paul's voice...well, he sounds incredible...no change in quality - a very big plus indeed as so many just can't do it like they used to.<br /><br />All of that said, I kept wanting it to sound like Queen w/ Freddie & John's input.  It doesn't.  They're both out of the mix.  So you get more rock & blues which is what Roger & Brian brought to the band all along.  It truly is a collaboration between them & Paul.  I like the new blend. I like that they didn't do the predictable, re-writes of old songs to simply cash-in on the Queen or Bad Co./Free/Paul Rodgers history & reputation.<br /><br />Listen to it from that perspective.  It's new music from 3 of rock's most gifted & talented; Royalty to use the familiar term.  Can't wait to see them on tour.  Well done, Gents!  4 pints out of 5.
B001DU8T6S|2.0|What a waste of money. What a waste of talent. Please Brian May, please Roger Taylor, drop the Queen name off of your future projects with Paul Rodgers. This doesn't look, sound, or act like Queen music. If you are a Paul Rodgers fan, then this album is for you. It's retro throwback sound to MOR 70s hard rock, macho, sluggish, predictable, uncreative. You keep making PR statements to the effect that this is not an attempt to replace Freddie's vocals, yet you try to fool the public into buying this slop by using the Queen name. You want to play bland middle of the road rock, fine...but your fans deserve a little more thought and creativity than this embarrasing collection of garbage.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Honestly, who didn't like the Dark Knight? Talk about a cultural phenomenon. I was so dissapointed it didn't knock out that eternal suckbag Titanic out of the top. But, I enjoyed this movie more than any movie I have ever seen. It succeeds on a number of levels: as a crime drama, as a cop film and as the best superhero movie. Hopefully, next year's Watchmen is just as good.
B00006I53S|4.0|Like so many others, I also had a loose lens body.   Last year I spent the money and had the lense realligned, tightened and cleaned.  It was worth the $65 I spent to have the lense back in pristine shape.  As a result, I use it alot as a general purpose lens.     It takes excellent photos and is rapid in the area of focus and adjustment.   I personally think it is worth the money....just make sure you have a tight one.
B0017I1FP8|4.0|The collaboration between James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer captures the shadows and the perilous no man's land between good and evil of the outstanding movie.<br /><br />The longest selections - Why So Serious?, 9:14, A Dark Knight, 16:15 - stand triumphantly alone, as the listener does not need a scene or story line to appreciate them. Why So Serious? has an electronic soundscape that revolves around the evil and brooding Joker, but has an artistic elegance which reaches out and takes hold in a subtle manner. The remaining numbers are solid, but are better heard within the context of the film.<br /><br />This is one of several editions of the soundtrack, with a limited edition CD, digital download, CD digi-pack and LP currently available and a 2-CD special edition coming soon.
0793518326|5.0|I had bought several partitures and tablatures but this book really rocks. It worths every moment i spend learning how to play correctly all the Beatles' songs in all the instrument i choose
B001FBSLH2|5.0|WOW!!!   Joe Sample was awesome  along with ray parker and the rest of the band, new sounds and old grooves set the crusaders apart from all the rest.  Jazz at it's best the sound was great randy crawford voice is as strong as ever, just wish it had more songs from rural renewal cd.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Outstanding!!!!!!I was never a big RHCP fan, but after watching this DVD for the 75th time in a row because of how good it is, I highly reccomend this. John Frusciante might be the best guitarist around today, his solo during \\"Dont Forget Me\\" at the 55 minute mark, is the best minute of guitar playing Ive heard in decades, wish it would have lasted longer!!! This DVD is a must buy!
8185300534|5.0|Nisargadatta Maharaj was born into Indian rural poverty, drifted to the city, married, supported a family by selling cheap cigarettes. He found a guru, learnt a simple spiritual method, practised it devotedly and in three years \\"realised\\", to use the jargon. Gradually \\"spiritual seekers\\" began to beat a path to his shabby door. He died in 1981.<br /><br />I haven't yet worked out why this book is so excellent. No poetry, no eloquence, no indelible stories, no mind-stopping koans. Sri Maharaj lacks the saintly radiance of a Ramana Maharshi: he is a no-nonsense J&ntilde;ani (one who knows,) his manner is straightforward, cantankerous at times. He teaches only what his teacher taught him:<br />You think you are a body with a name, a home, with parents, a history, an identity. You are wrong. You are the boundless, changeless, formless Unnameable Reality that always was and always will be. So long as you fail to realise this, you suffer. The easiest way to realise is to concentrate on the pure sense of being - I Am - without content or specification.<br /><br />Walt Whitman described this as \\"the thought of identity, yours for you, whoever you are, as mine for me. Miracle of miracles, beyond statement, most spiritual and vaguest of earth's dreams, yet hardest basic fact, and only entrance to all facts.\\"<br /><br />All kinds of people come to him with all kinds of problems or questions; all are answered with the same teaching. Every word carries conviction, as a heavy weight falling leaves a deep mark in the ground. Nondualism was not a philosophy for Sri Maharaj, not a slogan to sell books, but the reality he lived at every moment. The sense of his presence carries over even through the printed word.<br />This book is for everyone interested in \\"spirituality\\", and for some who aren't. It's as accessible as the latest New Age bestseller but as profound as the Hindu tradition itself.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|Same old Metallica, was wanting something new by them but they let me down, so if you own anything else by them don't waste your money on this.
031606792X|5.0|Wonderful ending to the Twilight Saga.  Loved this book!!!  However, it left me wanting more Edward and Bella!
B001DPC52C|5.0|Black Symphony by Within Temptation is a great buy.  Not only is the cd worth having and listening to but the dvd of the concert.......well words can't justify.  What a concert, I would have loved to been there for it, the lights, pyrotechnics, everything was great.  An absolute \\"MUST HAVE\\" if you are a WT fan.
0375826726|4.0|an excellent addition to the series! only i was sad to find out that it wasn't the last one b/c now i have to wait longer to see how it ends, and i have no idea when the next one is coming out.
B000002AGN|5.0|This has been my favorite Dave Brubeck album for a long time.  I still have it on vinyl, although it it scratched, I would still listen to it.  When I saw it on Amazon, I just had to have it to take with me in the car.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Despite everyone else not liking Ang Lee's version of The Hulk, I-for one- loved his take on the Green Goliath. Sure, the movie has it's flaws but I've got to give him props for giving us something different than we were expecting. True, he took some liberties with the source material but, overall, it was true to the comic book. Anyone who's read the Hulk comic book will know that General Ross spent alot of his time going after the character in the comic book. Ang was dead-on in picking Eric Bana for the role of Bruce Banner, in my opinion, as he's a dead-on ringer for the comic book Bruce Banner(minus glasses, of course). I give him credit for fleshing out characters and developing the story so we'd understand things alot more as to why Hulk is on the run all the time. This is a comic-book movie in the truest sense of it. If I had any gripes, whatsoever, it would be that there wasn't as much action in the movie as I'd like it to have. Action as in Hulk battling  and generally wreaking havoc. His battle with his father towards the end wasn't much of a battle at all. Other than that, I thought Hulk was a pretty decent movie. People need to quit ragging on this movie so much. It wasn't THAT bad.
B0017V7GLC|4.0|If you ever thought hmm...female voices with Depeche Mode.  This is the scenario: Hooks, firmly in place, mikes and synths plugged with amps set at '11'... place the needle at the beginning of \\"Burning Up\\". And there you go and you're welcome.   Oh yeah, the rest of the album rocks, too.
B00005JPS8|5.0|My 13-year old son absolutely had to have this movie. I preordered it and it came on the release date. I absolutely love the AMAZON preordering option.
0446579939|5.0|Good product.  Came exactly as advertised - good packaging and fast delivery. Very good book.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|This movie gives a good solid ending to the series .... it answers the question of whether Carrie & Big do end up a couple .... it shows that not all endings are achieved in a fairytale type way .... it is real and combines the lives of all the characters in a true and realistic way .... it has allowed them to grow just that little more and proves that life doesn't end at 40 but continues .... highly recommended .... I personally have now watched it (including at the theatre) a total of 5 times and will continue to watch it again and again .... it is one of those classic, feel good movies that doesn't rely on a myriad of special effects or gore to create great entertainment. Highly, highly recommended.
0375826726|5.0|My Grandson loves to read and he is really into this series.  He couldn't wait for this book to come out.  It is hard to find ways to get teens to read in this day and age but these books make it easy.
0321344758|5.0|I bought this book to supplement a class I am taking to update my web design skills (I've been involved in web design & content management for over ten years).     I was a bit hazy on the \\"infrastructure\\" lesson, so I asked my teacher which book she recommended for extra information. She recommended this one.    THANK GOODNESS she did!    It's easy to read and understand and it's short so it did NOT end up in the pile o' books I have yet to read (I literally read half of it the day it arrived on my doorstep). It clarified all of my questions and doubts on how to organize a website and how to design for ease of use.    This book is a BLESSING in every sense.    Thank you so much, Steve, for a fantastic reference!
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|LOST Season 4 was my favorite season and included my favorite episode thus far, \\"The Constant.\\"  I'm consistently amazed how LOST is ever expanding in scope and in story telling.  I love the mythology of this show.
1563894696|4.0|The Long Halloween is one of the greatest stories I have ever read. Unfortunately, the ending is flawed in that it is either vague or implausible. No spoilers here. The journey to the ending is a lot better than the conclusion. Still this is worthy read for any fan of comics. BTW, my rating is really four-and-a-half stars.
0618680004|4.0|I believe in 'God' and still found this book to be an honest, rational and informative look at some glaring incongruities about Faith and Religion. Richard Dawkins has written a thoughtful, clear and brave treatise on irrational belief in God in the world today. Also check out books by Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens for further musings on this subject. I believe, along with the afore-mentioned authors, that too much religion is indeed harmful to our societies and to our psyche, and that these books are not dangerous to men and women of faith, but rather challenging and liberating. Perhaps we need books like these even more than the atheists/rationalists do.
0321200683|4.0|The patterns in this book were illustrated mostly with JMS.  There were mentions of Tibco and webMethods a few places though.  It makes it sound like most of the ideas for common integration patterns started in IBM labs.  My background is mostly in a commercial middleware and I recognized most of the patterns from the projects I've done the last 6 years.   The mention of BPEL in the future trends section was prophetic.  It looks like all the major vendors are moving toward orchestration using BPEL.    The design patterns were fairly comprehensive but I've noticed that more are being built around SOA and WOA today.  Most companies are now using SOA and REST for integrations were it makes sense to do so.
0812975219|4.0|The first cautionary point I would make the prospective reader of Nassim Taleb (in any form) is that he can definitely come off as extremely arrogant. He pulls very view punches in sharing his opinions, particularly about people, be it groups or individuals. His fellow Wall Street professional are vilified, as are those who can be considered the luminaries of financial theory and plenty of others. Taleb is free with his criticism, though he does also offer complimentary words for some others, like George Soros, whom he clearly respects.<br /><br />My second cautionary point is that Fooled by Randomness is not a handbook or scientific treatise of any sort. The author is actually pretty upfront about that. Taleb classifies it as an essay. I'll call it an expression of personal observation, opinion, and philosophy.<br /><br />The main thrust of Fooled by Randomness is quite simple. It's that people are fooled into believing that what are likely random things have instead some meaningful causality. Taleb talks about all the different ways this can happen, and they are fairly numerous. This is probably the aspect of the book which upsets the most readers (or prospective ones), because he essentially says that we cannot necessarily assume the success someone has in trading or business or whatever necessarily has anything to do with that individual's intelligence or skill or whatever. It might just be luck, good or bad.<br /><br />This is not, as I understand it, to say that Taleb believes everything is a matter of luck. Rather, he suggests that certain ventures (trading, for example) are much more influenced by randomness and uncertainty than others (dentistry, to cite his favored example). Naturally, the idea that randomness may be more important than our decision-making abilities is something that's not going to sit well with many people.<br /><br />Something I would have liked to see as a compliment to the uncertainly discussion was a bit of practical talk about the implications of uncertainty in how one operates, for example in how one develops a trading strategy. Aside from highlighting the requirement to account for that uncertainty, though, Taleb is mostly silent on the application side of things. Nor does he bring in much specific science or math into the discussion. I would have liked more of that, but the author states from the beginning that such will not be the focus, and he's supplied a number of notes and references in the back of the book toward that end.<br /><br />It's worth noting that the randomness angle isn't the only one in the book. There are plenty of other philosophical ideas discussed in the text as well.<br /><br />In terms of writing style, I found Taleb generally engaging and easy to read. There are some complex concepts he discusses which necessarily slow you down, but as I noted about, he doesn't get into stats and math and stuff like that, so the text is generally fluid. Grammar sticklers might be a bit put off by the relatively frequent use of sentence fragments at the start of paragraphs, but the ideas are communicated effectively nevertheless.<br /><br />As for the overall presentation, I personally found the latter part of the book to get a bit scattered, causing me to wonder where the author was going. Generally speaking, however, it was an enjoyable read. Taleb certainly triggered in me a number of different thoughts and ideas. Given that Fooled by Randomness is above all else a philosophical exposition, that is exactly what should have happened, so I would say the book definitely achieved it's objective. I definitely recommend itplications of uncertainty in how one operates, for example in how one develops a trading strategy.

0321127420|4.0|This book is not for beginners.  The patterns match many constructs I've built over the years.  It is pretty comprehensive and a foundation for the newer patterns of SOA and WOA.  A good addition to any architect's library.
B000002WNP|4.0|A deux remarques près, ces cinq CD incluent tous les enregistrements officiels de Presley (par ordre chronologique) de son retour de l'armée (1960) au 22 février 1969. Après cette période, ce sera le grand retour sur scène à Las Vegas, une autre histoire. Ce coffret propose donc tous les enregistrements studio des sixties à l'exception, et c'est important, des BO des films et surtout des deux albums de gospels enregistrés par Elvis pendant cette décennie. C'est une période ou Elvis a apprivoisé le grand public et qui pour certains correspond à ses plus grand succès (\\"Stuck on you\\", \\"It's now or never\\", \\"Good luck charm\\", \\"Big boss man\\", \\"In the ghetto\\") que vous retrouverez donc ici. Fini le rock débridé des fifties, place à la voix de velours accompagné d'une rytmique à toute épreuve. Mais si vous voulez écouter \\"Return to sender\\" du film \\"Girls, girl, girls\\" ou \\"Viva Las Vegas\\" du film éponyme, il vous faudra acquérir \\"Elvis, the Command performances\\", coffret de deux CD supplémentaires consacré aux meilleures chansons des films. Plus ennuyeux, si vous voulez retrouver Elvis dans les meilleurs enregistrements de toute sa carrière, les gospels, il vous faudra acquérir \\"Elvis Presley, Amazing Grace, his greatest sacred performances\\" coffret de deux autres CD indispensables. Mais ne boudons pas notre plaisir et retrouvons ici les magnifiques blues enregistrés en 1960 (\\"Reconsider Baby\\" par exemple) ainsi que les titres enregistrés pendant la fameuse session de janvier 1969 à l'American Studios de Memphis et publiés à l'époque dans l'album \\"From Elvis in Memphis\\" incluant entre autre \\"Suspicious Minds\\", \\"Kentucky rain\\" et autre \\"I'm movin'on\\". Quelques versions inédites ou alternatives complètent ce coffret remarquable de 130 titres.
0446579939|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  Sparks made me care deeply for the characters and I wanted (needed) to know how the story ended, so it was hard to put it down - but I won't ruin it for others.  I felt a connection with Logan's feelings and I found myself wishing I could meet 'him'.  The other characters, even the secondary ones, were well rounded and interesting, and you can't help but to have feelings (good or bad) for them too.  I think The Lucky One may become my favorite Sparks book and jump ahead of The Rescue, but I'll read it again before I decide.  Happy reading!!
1401322425|5.0|I loved the series and the cookbook is a great companion in the kitchen. Jamie Oliver has convinced me that we can make small differences to our habits when cooking that make big changes not only for our palettes but for our communities.  I now will go the extra step to try to buy local when possible.  I will search out available farmer's markets. I will speak with the grocer as to why there is not local produce.  And then we have the actual taste of the recipes!  So far, my particular favorites are the English Onion Soup with sage and Cheddar. This is a very basic recipe with the emphasis on the bountiful array of different onion species.  This is the essence of Jamie's recipes, simple ingredients but perfectly put together making a memorable meal.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|movie was good, so i ventured into the soundtrack... its great for those times one is in the mood for mellow, perhaps melancholic music. vedder's raw voice makes for good driving company.
0307269752|5.0|It started a tad slowly but the characters were inviting and the story progressed nicely. It all held together well and I enjoyed it a great deal. Looking forward to the release of his next book. Sad he died.
0307269752|5.0|I first heard of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" on the Jay Leno show.<br />That being said, I don't usually go for authors whom I am not familiar with. I stick to tried and tested authors like Lee Child and Stephen Hunter and the like..but seeing all the hype this debut author's book created I decided to give this one a chance. Boy! I wasn't disappointed!<br />My first reaction to the book was doubt seeing it's bulk. A solid 500+ pages. I am not very patient in reading long novels. But once I started reading The Girl with the Dragon Tatttoo, I couldn't stop and was finished with it over a weekend.<br />It started kinda slow...about some financial reporter and his investigation and some high finance stuff that made me think if I made a mistake starting reading this. But it soon picked up pace and every chapter end, I was slapped in the face with a new revelation that kept me going farther and farther into the book. a decades old cold case Murder, a sleepy small town, suspicious townsfolk who are all suspects in the investigation etc., makes this book truly worthwhile.<br />This book is full of shock and awe. I can assure that. I even gifted this book to my cousin and he loves it too.<br />I am only sad that the author is no more and his creations are limited to three books. I can't wait till January when the next book in this series is due to come out.<br />Read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and you'll soon be writing praise about it too. A solid 5 stars!!
0375826726|1.0|The book was ordered more than a month ago and still has not arrived. I have sent reviews of the bookseller as well as filed a claim with Amazon...NO REPLY FROM EITHER!!!! Guess I need to shop elsewhere. It appears as though Amazon nor their approved sellers have an interest in customer satisfaction once they have the money!!!!!
B000022TSY|5.0|Having read many of the worst reviews, I can fully appreciate where the kids are \\"coming from\\". They don't really get it because it was too full of the symbols of the time in which the film was shot. It is obviously not a piece of timeless art intended for future generations. It was for that time and it accomplished its goal, which was to wake up a new generation to the possibilities of life. Choices. the music was current and dynamic and added to the power. Unless you are old enough, or have submerged yourself in the period, I would not expect you to enjoy it. If Woodstock The Movie, or The Last Waltz have meaning for you, you'll probably get something from it. Otherwise, just assume that you don't get it because YOU HAD TO BE THERE. Film classes might be able to put into context for you.
B00194TJXA|5.0|ummm... I thought it was going to be difficult to better than Witching Hour, but this album is HUGE sounding!!! I absolutely love it.
0385338910|4.0|I have a new found respect for Johnathon Tropper after reading, How to Talk to a Widower. This book is written very lucidly, and connects with its reader write from the opening sentence. After reading the first page, you can already picture the main character, Doug, his step-son Russ, and his dead wife, Hailey. Although Doug is young, he finds himself in suburbia, a life that doesn't suit him. The life he lives has a 'Desperate Housewives' tone to it; the close knit gossip, the cheating wives, and the dating scene are all in this book.<br /><br />Though the book tells a great story of a family torn apart after the death of Doug's wife, there are a couple chapters (shaded in grey) that are personal soliloquies of Doug's thoughts. These chapters had the most impact on its reader. It allowed for them to crawl inside the mind of Doug, who is satirical, dark, and witty. Tropper tackles the taboo areas of happiness after tragedy; joy following immense sorrow. The main character finds it hard to be successful, because it would mean it came from the expense of someone he loved. This is the part of the book I liked the most.<br /><br />Overall, the book is powerful yet easy to read. Many of us can relate to the dysfunction of Doug's immediate family, from the boozing mother and the ailing father, to the attention seeking siblings.  I have given this book four stars, because it is a bit long-winded and predictable. But if you are looking for a book you can finish in a few days, that tells a great unique story, and has dark humor, then this book is for you.<br /><br />Dennis B. Thapa

B001ASVXSE|4.0|As a violinist who has occasionally been known to utter things like \\"Oistrakh is God!\\" I am very happy to see this collection come out and I may well pick it up, even though I have almost all the recordings on vinyl. But a few words of caution might be in order, given what I can glean from the track listings and the review that lists the performers and tracks more thoroughly.    First I should say that there are many great recordings here. The Cluytens/Beethoven Concerto is certainly up there with the greatest recordings of this piece, as is the Brahms Double with Szell and Rostropovich. And no one plays Mozart better than Oistrakh; the set is surely worth owning for the Mozart concerti alone. His EMI recordings of the Khatchaturian and Shostakovish #1 concerti are the definitive versions of those works (with one caveat: he does not play Khatchaturian's original cadenza, which is fine with some people, but I personally wish he had.) The recordings of both Prokofiev concerti and the Violin Sonatas are also all but definitive; I know of none better, though occasionally someone comes close. Of great interest to me is the recording of the Lalo Symphonie Espagnole with Jean Martinon; my collection of more than 40 Oistrakh disks includes a great performance of this piece with Kondrashin, but I have never heard the one in this set.    That said, I have several reservations about this edition. First, I am of the remastering school. I have hardly ever heard a CD transfer, classical or otherwise, that was not improved by a careful remastering job (though a lousy job can surely destroy a recording too). I do not see any reference to remastering in the listing, so I assume it is a straight transfer. Which would be too bad, because no recorded legacy is more worthy of careful remastering than that of David Oistrakh. On the other hand, the set would surely have doubled in price, so I suppose there is something to be said for mass availability.    Second, I'm afraid this does notlook to me like the complete EMI collection. Some of the things I noticed missing are the second Shostakovish violin concerto (not equal to the first, but necessary for completeness), and the recordings made with Frida Bauer: Didone Abandonata and Devil's Trill sonata of Tartini, and Brahms Sonata #1. These gaps are based on a quick perusal of my recordings; it would surprise me if they were the only ones. Incidentally, the track listing (in both the Amazon track list and the user review) includes a Mozart violin sonata \\"#32 in B-flat, K.454\\". There is no such work. The work is probably the Mozart violin and piano sonata #15, K.454, and it is in E-flat.    Third, while this should not discourage anyone from acquiring this rich collection of recordings, I cannot help but be reminded how many of Oistrakh's most important recordings were not on EMI. His mesmerizing recordings of the Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, Glazunov and Dvorak concerti are nowhere to be found here. Neither is his greatest recording of the Sibelius concerto, with Ormandy. His recording of the Bach sonatas for violin and harpsichord, released on DG, are surely among my desert island disks. There is no recording here of the Chausson Poeme, at which he is one of the great masters. Ditto the Ysaye Ballade and the Debussy Sonata, both released on a Phillips collection. The first Schubert Piano Trio is there, but the David Oistrakh Trio also recorded the second one for Melodya, which jointly released it with a German label. And there is not a single example of his joint recordings with Igor, who was, by some bizzare miracle of nature, almost as great a fiddler as his father.     So all in all, my advice is: enjoy this collection, but don't forget it just scratches the surface of the work of this musical genius.

B00005OM4Q|5.0|I just recently bought this DVD after years of seeing it on the shelf and never having picked it up.  I am sorry I didn't after watching it.  The extra scenes make the movie even better after having seen it a few times over the last few years.  The cd containing 6 Stillwater tracks is also a bonus.  If you love this movie, this edition is worth picking up.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|I'll make it short: one of the top films of the 70s; one of the most disappointing DVDs of the 2000s.  But I can't bring myself to rant; WB came to the rescue on ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, DELIVERANCE, NETWORK, and DOG DAY AFTERNOON, to mention a few.  Until they rescue CABARET from a similarly shoddy series of editions, I'll wait before giving them my money for this one.  But I have faith.  C'mon, 'Bros.!
B00005JPS8|5.0|excelent movie. the second disc is also full of very interesting material. sold at a good price and received promptly.
B00004WG2F|5.0|This complex saga of love, grief & loyalty is narrated with stark simplicity by old Stab, long-time friend to retired Colonel Ludlow & his 3 sons: staid Alfred, the eldest (\\"old even for his years\\"); idealistic Samuel, the youngest (\\"There was nothing these brothers would not do for him.\\"); & wild Tristan (\\"Such people become crazy or they become legends.\\"). The conflict between Ludlow's fiercely anti-government anti-war stance & his sons' determination to do what they see as their duty is but part of the story; the heart of the tale is the rift that threatens the mutual devotion of these 3 loyal brothers as they all come to love the same woman. \\"She was not to blame,\\" Stab tells us, \\"She was like the ice that freezes in the rock and splits it apart.\\"    A tragic tale, yes; heartbreaking at times, but never boring. Every time I felt certain I knew what was coming next, the plot took another unexpected turn & I sat there riveted, softly breathing \\"Wow!\\" now & again into the darkness. This film immediately became one of my all-time favorites; I've watched it half a dozen times since then & its scope & power still move me.

B00005JKGK|5.0|The very first time I saw this movie I was 17.  My grandmother took me to see it.<br /><br />As a teenage girl I was an emotional wreck over the mother-daughter dilemmas presented by this film.  I cried the whole way through.  I was so glad my grandmother brought a box of tissues with her.<br /><br />I recently saw this movie again at 32 and felt engaged by it on a different level.  Now understanding more the personal dilemmas of each of the female characters.<br /><br />It's an interesting experience to witness one's own relationship to a story change with age and life.<br /><br />While this story is specific to some of the extra added pressures of the Chinese and Chinese-American cultural experience, the tale itself can be understood by all who've ever dealt with parental conflict, issues of inadequacy, a need to rebel, marital strife, a desire to find oneself and so on.<br /><br />Sadly, I've not read the movie's novel predecessor, though I think it would be no less satisfying an experience given Ms. Tan's talent for relaying the human experience of her characters as equally along with their Chinese experience.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|This movie was so before its time. We ordered it days before Newman's death was reported, and when we got the movie in the mail, he had just passed away. So, we watched it with reverance for Newman's full body of work over the years. As far as prison movies go, this would have to be at the top of the list. As far as Newman goes, this is HIS movie. He dominates the film from start to finish -- with strong supporting roles from all the actors, who have gone on to great work themselves. The movie is funny, sad, poignant, rebellious, and somewhat inspiring in terms of what the human spirit is capable of. With that said, Newman's character is made heroic for all the wrong reasons. He has no respect for authority and has clearly squandered his opportunities in life and what was apparently a successful military career. Lines like \\"night in the box\\" and \\"failure to communicate\\" still resonate in common venacular 40 years later. Viewers will also never see boiled eggs quite the same.

0061547840|3.0|I have read most of Trump's books. Not 'all' of them...but most of them.    Unfortunately, this book goes the way of the last Jack Welch book: for a new reader, it's etnertaining and educational. For an old fan, it's rehash.    I've already heard his views of Prenuptual agreements. I also already heard the story about his stupid friend who married 4 times without one.    I already know the story about how the bum in the street was worth 900 million more dollars than he was.    I've already heard him insist on thinking big and promoting your self.    I've also heard him demand that you don't get walked on.    In fact, the only 'new' information...new meaning 'current'...are his tirades about Martha Stewart and Rosie O'Donnell.    So, if you've never read Trump's work before...you'll likely find this book to be rather motivating. I like DOnald Trump, and overall his information is good.    But if you are already familiar with his rhetoric, skip this one. There is nothing new in it that can be deemed 'valuable'.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I had just started to change my eating habits with Weight Watchers and wanted to incorporate this with the cardio I get with my elliptical.  It certainly helped to jump start my weight loss!  This is a really tough workout at first and some results are noticeable very soon when you are consistent with it.  Beware how it can affect your knees though, there is plenty of jumping in this dvd.  Just remember to stretch them out and warm them up before you start a workout and keep good form.  Otherwise, it works great to help you accomplish nice results!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I bought this last Christmas for my then-16-yr-old son.  He loved it, and we had fun watching it with him.  I do not allow my younger children to watch this type of movie, however (they are 2/6/8/10).
1596434252|2.0|I got this book because I study dimensional typography. I wasn't expecting it to be a revelation, but thought it might be a \\"fun\\" book to have. After the first couple of pop-ups, I found the sense of wonder to trickle off pretty quickly, as there are not really that many surprises. The pop up techniques seem pretty reptitious...and I wonder if it could offer any sustained interest even for young children.     The bottom line: pretty unimaginative as a children's book, not substantive enough for adults.

B0000BX8FT|4.0|The reason I say that in the caption is, there are several separate listings for CDs with the exact same cover and the same tracks on two discs, then there's one with a single disc and just 20-odd tracks. The one I have seems to be a match for this listing as it comes from Warner Special Marketing/MCA and has the same tracks.<br /><br />I do know that, when I purchased my copy, I did so with some misgivings. I mean, here was a lady who, after splitting with Sonny, went on to register 33 Billboard Pop Hot 100 hit singles from 1965 to 1999 plus two more that made only the Adult Contemporary (AC) charts. So, I was kind of hoping that, in a collection with 42 tracks, we'd be getting all 35 of those hits at least, along with perhaps some of the better B-sides.<br /><br />But no, instead they throw in five of her duets with Sonny (tracks 8, 9, 14, 20 and 21 on disc 2), and you have to wonder why since those are readily available on several CDs dealing with the duo (e.g., The Best Of Sonny & Cher: The Beat Goes On from Atco/Atlantic). Anyone who knows Cher's music will see at a glance that at least half a dozen of the cuts here were not among her \\"very best\\" - at least insofar as that term applies to her hit singles.<br /><br />Where, for example, is Where Do You Go? which, at # 25 Billboard Pop Hot 100 in late 1965 on Imperial, was really her first true \\"solo\\" hit, even though All I Really Want To Do (which is here) came out a few months earlier and went to # 15, since Sonny provided \\"backing\\" vocals on that Imperial release. And what about Alfie, a # 32 in summer 1966 and You Better Sit Down Kids, a # 8 in late 1967 and her last Imperial hit.<br /><br />In June 1972, now at Kapp Records, she had Living In A House Divided go to # 3 AC/# 22 Hot 100 and, in August 1974, had I Saw A Man And He Danced With His Wife make it to # 3 AC/# 42 Hot 100. Some might argue that the latter was not included since it failed to reach the Hot 100 Top 40, but then they do include the 1996 # 52 One By One and the 1999 # 57 Strong Enough (which also made # 8 and # 29 AC respectively). By that reckoning they could have included the Neil Sedaka-penned tune, Don't Hide Your Love, which finished at # 19 AC/# 46 Hot 100!<br /><br />What is here has excellent sound reproduction, and while the four pages of liner notes by author, film critic, and TV personality Kurt Loder are interesting and informative, having it printed in light grey font on a purple background makes them very difficut to read, even if you have 20-20 vision. Also, the re-listing of the tracks, while showing composers/writers, year of recording, and the album in which each originally appeared, offers nothing in the way of chart results. Two more nice shots of the beautiful Cherilyn Sarkisian are included.<br /><br />Not a bad collection - just that it could have been more definitive of her \\"very best\\" with just a bit more thought.Strong Enough (which also made # 8 and # 29 AC respectively).

B0013ND30M|5.0|Walt Disney's \\"SLEEPING BEAUTY\\" has been my favorite Disney film forever!  The animation is great, the characters are terrific, especially my all-time favorite villain, Maleficent!  The restoration and wider picture on this version are fantastic.  I compared it with an older version of the movie and the difference is unbelievable.      This is not just for kids, but for Boomers too!  And isn't that dragon the best?
0061245097|5.0|Holy moley does this sequel pack a punch! Halfway to the Grave was easily readable due to the characters and how their chemistry unfolded in an action packed plot. It's always interesting to read sequels and see which path they take, and this one packed a punch for me. Slightly darker, more character development & a love scene that leaves you shakin... this book did not disappoint! All tied to an ending that rocks the paranormal mind & of course, leaves you screaming for more. Graves End, here I come!

0670020745|5.0|Jill Bolte Taylor captures my attention with her view on energy fields.  A must read!  Read on to see what I mean.  It may mean a major change in health care.<br /><br />Early on in her experience with her stroke she mentions feeling fluid, flowing in a field without boundaries.  She felt part of the universal energy and it was tranquil, safe and blessed. This is a woman who had diminished or no functioning in her left brain.<br /><br />As she worked to get help she observed the energy of business cards as she held them. She then, after finding the \\"right\\" energy, did she match the patterns on the card to patterns on the phone.  She did not recognize them as numbers. Some phone numbers she only remembered as patterns...or rhymes.  When her co-worker answered the phone it was his reassuring tone/energy that let her know help was on the way.  She could not understand what he was saying.<br /><br />Help arrives and later a kind-hearted paramedic's energy which is compassionate and comforting transported me to the hospital. She really appreciated his response to her. Arrival at the Emergency room was confusing with all the different energies, some good, some not so.  It was difficult with all the noises, energy fields (Bodies) moving about and all the questions.  What she really appreciated was when the staff connected with her by touching her gently, making eye contact, speaking slowly and softly.  She knew these people were there to help her. Her request of them: \\"Respect me. I am in here. Come find me\\".<br /><br />As her treatment continued it was the \\"kind\\" energy she responded to and to their requests.  If the staff person was `off energy\\" she wished they would leave as they were sucking her energy.  She didn't have any energy to give anyone as she began her recovery.  TV was disturbing when the person in the other bed was watching anything.<br /><br />After she returned home it was the greeting cards that brought joy and good energies.  Her mother, who was her caregiver for several months, hung them around her apartment. They helped her heal.  Visits from friends were limited or eliminated as it took too much energy to watch their lips as they spoke to her.  TV, talk radio and the phone were off limits.<br /><br />I find it very interesting her readings on the energies around her.  Perhaps you can translate Jill's experiences with energy to your life.  What will change?  Think now how you will respond to a friend or family member in the hospital.  How can you support them if they are in recovery, short or long term?  Jill's recovery took eight years.  If you are the patient, not just a stroke patient, how do you want to be treated?  What requests can you, will you ask of your family and friends?<br /><br />In the bigger picture I hope that the staff, all staff, of hospitals, assisted living, and recovery centers read this book.  May they come to some understanding of the importance of meeting the patient or resident with respect from the energy point of view.  If you can't find the energy, the attitude to do this then asked to be transferred where you don't have personal contact.  It could change the health care system.hem around her apartment.

Alan Moore (the Shakespeare of the graphic novel medium) wrote this story as a realistic look at the superhero genre.  These aren't tough guys who can do no wrong, these are real people who happen to be stronger than everyone else.  This book is a great look at the psyche of a superhero coupled with a dramatic storyline that weaves through history and twists at every turn.  Simply stunning.

Also enjoyed the interactive bonus features (Iron Man trivia) and the story behind the character...and, by the way, gwyneth paltrow looks amazing in this movie...
B000VWYNOG|3.0|I am now only beginning to get into Van Morrison though I've been aware of him for a while.  Who hasn't heard Brown Eyed Girl or Gloria on the radio.  This album is probably a good step for some one like me who is just getting started however this album has 21 tracks and his Greatest Hits is a 2 CD set yet neither have Tupelo Honey, and this one is missing In The Mysty.  This album would have been complete with those two tracks and there's a couple on here I would have gladly traded for them.  So I will now have to add Moondance at some point to get In The Mysty and buy the album Tupelo Honey to get that track.  I thought I remembered that song in the Big Chill but it isn't on the soundtrack, so I could be mistaken.  One other beef is this album is supposed to be \\"remastered\\" yet on several of the early tracks background hiss is easily audible.  Even with that the version of Brown Eyed Girl is one of the better ones I've heard.  All in all this album has 21 tracks which of most are very good and for the price is a bargain.  Van Morrison isn't the norm for me but there is something about his music that just draws me in.  He is also very versatile, at home doing his soulful ballads, fun up tempo toe tappers or even the Blues.  If you are a fan you may already have all of his albums for the rest of us Still On Top is a good way to start appreciating Van Morrison.  If you are on the fence, go for it, you won't be disappointed.
B001D08SK0|4.0|First off, the packaging of this set is flat out gorgeous.  From the blue vinyl... to the book... to the photographs... to the reproduced artifacts... to the slipcase, this release truly is a collector item.  So if you REALLY love the album (and by that I mean not just the music but everything about it from the artwork to Bill Evans' liner notes on down), you will not be disappointed.    That said there is not much in the way of new material here.  The false starts and studio dialog really add nothing for the casual-to-mid-level listener.  There is a cool live take of \\"So What\\", but it's not worth dropping a Benjamin for.  I haven't watched the dvd yet, but it sounds like from other reviews that it may be the same one included with the DualDisc version.  So if you REALLY need to hear new material to justify the purchase of this set, you will be disappointed.    In summary I would recommend buying this if:  a) you read and enjoyed Ashley Kahn's book about the album  b) you have a turntable.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|I rented Sal&oacute; after reading the reviews on both Netflix and Amazon.com. I thought I was getting a visually stunning, mind opening, erotic masterpiece. What I saw was one of the most disturbing moves ever made. It is sick, twisted and demented to say the least. There is nothing erotic about this movie at all; there is nothing beautiful about this movie at all. I do not believe in censorship and anyone has the right to make a movie on any subject but I do have the right to say this is just not for me and I personally found Sal&oacute; sickening. I would not recommend this movie to anyone and in fact warned my wife not to watch it because I knew it would make her ill. Please be aware of what you are getting if you buy or rent this movie. I will add my very short synopsis of the movie, a bunch or sick freaks, kidnap and torture some poor young people, with some rape, and murder thrown in.

Instead of this book, try Harry Potter, The Eldest, Twilight, or Abhorsen.

6301963717|1.0|I had seen Fargo, and was prepped to have a good time with Miller's Crossing.  I knew it was meant to be a takeoff on film noir, so I didn't expect great art.  Just some fun.    Nope.  Even with the stellar acting power of Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney, this souffle falls flat.  There is no -- as in NO -- plot to follow.  All you see are guys dressed up like 30's mobsters, trying to talk tough and clever.  But their lines aren't actually tough, and they certainly aren't clever.      Halfway in, I commented to my wife, \\"It's kind of hard to follow,\\" to which she said, It's impossible.  Nothing's happening.\\"  We popped the DVD out at that point, and put in another movie.  Maybe if I'd stuck it through to the end, some little thing would have actually happened.  But that's not the point of this kind of movie, is it?  It's supposed to be a fun ride.  Sorry, but no.    For a fun Coen movie, try Raising Arizona.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.      Tom B.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|A warm, sensitive and delightful movie; well made and well acted.  This is a quiet true story about a wonderful and creative woman who, as it turns out, appears to have been the J.K. Rowling of her time.  You will find no car chases, gun fights or explosions in this movie so if you need plenty of \\"action\\" to entertain you, you will probably want to pass on this one.
B000007XUQ|5.0|a very touching album. it was so much cheaper to get this double CD set. a very pretty, touching sound. it's karen's pretty voice. the cd cover photo is a bit grainy & the rest of the group should have been on the front cover. enjoy.
0439023483|3.0|Maybe this is just not for me, but I stopped reading this after 150 pages, when they enter into the 'Hunger Games.'  I was frustrated; I liked the writing, I liked the main characters, I think this is a writer to watch, but when I realized I was going to be spending 150+ more pages reading about a group of 12-16 year old kids MURDERING each other, well...I found that really hard to stomach and decided to stop reading.  It makes me wonder why this doesn't bother more people.  Kids murdering kids.  I don't find that enjoyable to read.  Too bad, because I was enjoying the read until the realization of what the central action was going to be hit me.  Too dark and mean for me.
B000GCFO08|3.0|This movie did okay from game to movie but still lacks the overwhelming creepy feeling you get from the game. I think part of that comes from not being able to interact with the movie whereas the game is controlled by the player. Good imagery, decent acting, creepy score but lacks that certain something. The ending of the movie was a bit disappointing to me.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I am very pleased with the movie \\"Iron Man\\" that was delivered to my home as it is a birthday present for my niece.  She and I had seen the movie together and enjoyed it immensely. Thank you for having the movie at a reasonable price and for delivering it so fast.  Keep up the good work and by the way it is an excellent movie.
B001CDLATE|5.0|This is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen. I won't bore you with the details but please please watch this sometime in your life with no distractions. The slide show of images and sounds in the film will conjure up every feeling known to man-kind; sadness, frustration, anger, peace, love, happiness, hope, fear, etc. This film left me speechless the first time I saw it with my friends.. we all sat in silence through the entire film and when it was over, we all took away a greater appreciation of \\"life\\" and \\"the world\\". The flow of the pictures and their transitions will take your breath away.    This is most definitely a solid 5 star film.
B001DPC52C|5.0|This will be a very pure review in that up until last week I'd never heard of this band, and I still know nothing about them except what I've gathered from the documentary within this fantastic DVD. Which is not much since I'm not fluent in their language.    I'm not into Goth Metal and, y'know, I'm old. I don't read KERRANG but I saw an intriguing ad for this in the UK's MOJO magazine, went to the band's website and was totally knocked out by the sample video. On the strength of that exposure alone I ordered the CD/DVD that night, and with great pleasure I can tell you that it's a KNOCK-OUT. The most exhilarating, absorbing and awe-inspring concert video I've seen since Pink Floyd's PULSE.    Aside from the instant and obvious reaction of falling head over heels for the lovely Sharon, founder and lead vocalist, great praise must go to the band for writing some curiously beautiful and haunting music, to the superbly refreshing Metropole Orchestra, the only symphonic assemblage I've ever thought of as THRILLING... and the Choir Pa'dam, who fly very high, right up your spine.    And BRAVO to the set designer and technical crew whose stage and visuals are as majestic as anything I've ever seen on a stage. Even the stilt walking angels who appear briefly are mesmerizing. I know, even I can't believe I'm saying that...    Quite seriously, this is an extraordinary visual and auditory treat. Great extras as well. All in all a tremendous bargain and a disc set I'll long treasure. There'll be a lot of \\"Hey, you gotta sit down and watch this\\" evenings with my friends...    To non-metalheads like me, let me say this - don't be put off by the \\"Goth-Metal\\" tag - this isn't dark - it isn't all the things you assume it will be. Don't rob yourself of something joyous and bright. There's great talent and intelligence at work here.    Oh, and there's a CD as well. I haven't listened to it yet. I can't get my eyes off the screen.
B000002J5K|5.0|great service, great cd, love to order from amazon!My five year old grand-son loves to listen to this cd. I sat on the old one and broke it, so had to get one here quick!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|What a movie. The 2 1/2 hours felt like 2 1/2 minutes. One of the best movie you will see. for the losers who rated this movie 0 stars, you shouldn't be allowed to write a review as much as those who voted twice for G. W. Bush shouldn't be allowed to vote again!! Go OBAMA
031606792X|4.0|My wife heard about these books from several women at work so she went and bought all four of them.  She started reading them and couldn't put them down.  She said I should read them because I like vampires.    I started reading them and I couldn't put them down.  I had to pace myself to keep from reading them too fast.  Her writing style isn't perfect, but you can overlook that because the story is so great.  There are some problems with Breaking Dawn that you can't overlook.    The biggest one is Edward getting Bella pregnant.  I write vampire stories as a hobby and I've never come across anything like that in my research.  It seems she came up with the pregnantcy to furthur the plot because she couldn't come up with anything more creative.  I also wouldn't let a 12 year old read this because of some of the gore and sexual content in the book, even though they have probably read worse.    If you can accept the pregnantcy, it has some twist and turns that are very surprising.  It's definately worth reading, it's just not as good as the others.  I like the happy ending because of all the things Edward and Bella had to go through for love.  I think we deserve one because we went on that journey with them.     I have a 3 year old daughter, and because of Bella I think I will let her mother handle her teenage years.  As far as guys, if you like vampires, you're missing out on a great series.
0061119725|5.0|this is a great interactive book. my 2.5 year old loves the challenge question after every animal 'can you do it??' our fav is the donkey kick. the book is huge. i did not know that. probably the reason why it is so expensive....but well worth it....definitely two thumbs up!!!!

B00006ADD5|5.0|The movie is a masterpiece. I heard about it previously and decided to purchase it due to comments and reviews. It portrays the stuggle of the Arab tribes in Arabia with Lawrence uniting them to victory over the Ottoman Empire during WWI. It is a classic.

B001FBSMW6|5.0|The new Keane album isn't so much a departure as it is an expansion on the original formula. True, this is a happier Keane, complete with synths and Tears For Fears-type anthems, than seen in the past, but what's wrong with stirring the pot a bit when the perfect chemicals are still there? This album is chock-full of alternative rock hooks and lush choruses, along with the same driving piano anthems as always. Beautiful progression for a great band!
B000VWYNNW|5.0|Led Zeppelin's first live album which was the soundtrack to their movie The Song Remains the Same was first released in October of 1976 and then was re-released in November of 2007.<br />For years, many people complained about this album but the reasons for this and its off-shoot concert film was because of lead singer Robert Plant still being out of commission from injuries in a car crash in 1975 and a lack of a tour to support the band's 1976 highly underrated Presence album (one of their best IMHO).<br />Guitarist Jimmy Page then flew to New York to mix the live shows, that the band performed in July of 1973 on its Houses Of The Holy Tour at Madison Square Garden, originally done for the 1976 release at Electric Lady Studios with engineer Eddie Kramer. For this 2007 re-issue, the soundtrack was remixed by Page and Kevin Shirley and remastered by Bob Ludwig with phenomenal results.<br />When I heard that a re-issue was coming with almost full show, I was ecstatic and nervous at the same time.<br />We begin disc one with a spirited \\"Rock and Roll\\" which buries the studio version. Next we segue into \\"Celebration Day\\", which was not in the movie but is, a great rocker and even better live. Then we go into a killer version of \\"Black Dog\\" (with a teaser of \\"Bring It On Home\\"). Next are spirited and excellent previously unearthed versions of \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" and \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\". We follow with the superb rendition of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" which finally appears on album. Next is \\"No Quarter\\" which is a great version showing John Paul Jones was not only a great bass player but great keyboard player as well. Then we follow with a spirited version of \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" which buries the studio version by a longshot. We end the first disc with first \\"The Rain Song\\" which is actually longer on the album than in the movie but a powerful version. For technical reasons of the CD format, a stellar version of \\"The Ocean\\" closes the first disc (although this song was performed last in the encore on the 1973 tour).<br />The second CD of this re-mixed remaster is a near 30 minute version of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" which is somewhat different than the one on the orginal 1976 soundtrack album and is the version found in the film. The violin bow section was the best I ever heard. Also, the jam that goes on is amazing and it ends with a killer Page solo and a killer John Bonham drum solo at the end. We follow with arguably the best version of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" which is 11 minutes of majestic bliss and I can play this repeatingly. Next is a killer version of \\"Moby Dick\\" which shows the late Bonzo behind his drum kit playing his heart out at the drum kit and tympani be it with drumsticks or barehanded! We follow with a great version of \\"Heartbreaker\\" which is excellent and segues into the powerful closer \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" which is the film edit (as it's missing the jam which had some references to the Houses Of The Holy track The Crunge but c'est la vie). The theramin and Plant screaming section was superb with bass player John Paul Jones and Bonzo adding a great riff to it. Then the medley of Boogie Mama was excellent before going back to Whole Lotta Love and ending with Bonzo's literally \\"flaming gong\\" bashes.<br />This re-release of The Song Remains the Same I see more as a fresh look at a classic live album with alternate performances and just as good and at times (better) than the original 1976 soundtrack release.<br />Recommended!g was performed last in the encore on the 1973 tour).

B00006G8K0|5.0|This British-produced film, the first Dracula film from Hammer Studios, is brilliantly directed by Terence Fisher and is a true classic in the long-standing tradition of Hammer Horror. The story is slightly different from the original novel and also from the Bela Lugosi 1931 version, in that the budget only allowed for the story to take place basically within the same area of land. Arriving at Castle Dracula, Jonathan Harker (John Van Eyssen) meets the Vampire Prince (played wonderfully by Christopher Lee), but does not survive his experience unscathed. His undead corpse is found by friend Professor Van Helsing (Peter Cushing, once again turning in a strong performance and playing off Lee very well), and Van Helsing releases Harker's soul. He then travels to the town Harker lived in and informs Arthur Holmwood (Michael Gough) and his wife, Mina (Melissa Stribling) as well as Holmwood's sister, Lucy (Carol Marsh). A series of occurrences bring Dracula to the town, where he vampirizes Lucy and she is found out and released also by Van Helsing. Then, Mina begins acting strange, and Van Helsing begins to suspect the Prince of Darkness has something to do with it. A climactic chase, the confrontation between Dracula and Van Helsing and the terrific ending really highlight this stellar production. The DVD of this production is a bit bare-boned when it comes to special features, with only a trailer and cast and production biographies, but it is still a true classic 50 years after its original release. I do highly recommend seeing this one and getting it if you can find it. 4 3/4 stars out of 5.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Led Zeppelin's third live album (and first triple live album) How the West Was Won was released in May of 2003.<br />Despite the fact it was recorded in June of 1972, this live album sounds like it was recorded yesterday.<br />This live album was released in conjunction with the Led Zeppelin 2-DVD set that came out in May of 2003.<br />The other two live releases, 1976's The Song Remains the Same (which was re-released in a much better version in 2007) and 1997's BBC Sessions, whilst both great, arguably don't match the fire and passion this 3-disc live effort has!<br />How the West Was Won was recorded in June of 1972 in California during the warm-up tour for Houses of the Holy which would not be released for almost an entire year. Jimmy Page's guitar work, Robert Plant's vocals, John Paul Jones' bass playing and keyboard work and the late John Bonham's drumming were just arguably at their best on this set.<br />Led Zeppelin turn out superior live versions of \\"The Immigrant Song\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Going to California\\", \\"That's the Way\\", \\"Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp\\", \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" and the closing \\"Bring it On Home\\" I have ever heard.<br />\\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Rock and Roll\\" and \\"Black Dog\\" are excellent here although am more biased to the versions on the re-issued The Song Remains the Same.<br />Also, Zeppelin were not afraid to stretch out live as demonstrated on \\"Dazed and Confused\\" with Page's eerie violin bow guitar solo (and teasers of the then un-released tracks \\"The Crunge\\" and 'Walter's Walk\\" in the middle section after the violin bow solo where the band jam), \\"Moby Dick\\" is phenomenal with Bonham's killer drum solo showing us why he was one of rock and roll's greatest drummers and lastly the extended \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" which rivals the version on The Song Remains the Same (either the original 1976 release or 2007 re-release).<br />Also, Zeppelin previewed the then-upcoming Houses of the Holy album (not released until March of 1973) with stellar versions on \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", a teaser of \\"The Crunge\\" in \\"Dazed and Confused\\", \\"Dancing Days\\" and of course \\"The Ocean\\".<br />Kevin Shirley plus Zeppelin mastermind Jimmy Page remixed and remastered this album in a painstaking fashion and the results are extremely superb.<br />When How the West Was Won was released, the public spoke (I helped the cause) and pushed How the West Was Won to #1 in its first week on Billboard (last \\"from-the-vault\\" live album to reach #1 as of this moment) and went Platinum with a bullet!

B00192KCQ0|2.0|Metallica came back with a vengeance and really pulled together some strong material. I was shocked to hear it after the dreadful St. Anger. But the SOUND on the CD is really horrible. Clipped, distorted, all high end...it sounds like a cheap, poorly recorded demo.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I am nutty for this show. I can't remember being this crazy about a show in years. I've been hooked since the first episode. Then read all the books in 2 weeks. I watch the reruns everynight. I think I have been glamoured. I can't believe I had never heard of Stephen Moyer before. Reminds me of a southern Mr. Darcy. Anna Paquin is adorable.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|This is an awesome CD.  Every song quickly became my favorite.  I am not a fan of the Gospel song.  I wish J. Hudson would have chosen a different one.  The CD is definitely worth the wait and the money.  She ranks as one my favorites along with Jill Scott, Fantasia, Ledisi.  I encourage people not to download but to buy this one and show Jennifer your support.
B000W91RUG|5.0|i hope to see the season 2 now on dvd because the first its so good men those people are incredible. the sarcasm its good and the combination with technolgy too.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|Okay, enough has been said about the script and the dialogue, but why, with all the amazing technology available, is the 3D use of red and blue the only way to see this film in 3D.  There is a total loss of the color photography, ghosting worse than my old 10\\" tv with rabbit ears, and the makings of a terrible headache and nausea.  I noticed POLAR EXPRESS is doing the same thing.  FORGET IT.  Stick to the memory of the REAL 3D in the theatre and watch the 2D version.  There is a technique that was used a few years ago for the Rose Parade on new year's day where the camera was constantly panning and moving and the glasses were left eye clear and right eye partially grayed out.  For some reason the messages sent to the brain caused a sense of depth (The JUDDS did a music video in 3D that uses this technique and was very effective).  I've also found that if I wear these glasses with a normaL 2D film, it will add a sense of depth to it and layering.  But red and blue?  Very blurry, ghosty and hard to watch.  CAVEAT EMPTOR
0805079831|3.0|I have been enthralled by Klein's masterly work and horrified by her observations.  I read or skimmed the one-star reviews and found some well written objections coming from specific places.  Several advocated reading Friedman's work.  However, I remember him on TV: \\"it's not about fairness, life is unfair\\" he would say.  I profoundly disagree.  Life is unfair but politics and economics should be about fairness.  We don't have to exacerbate the unfairness.  If I simply read a Friedman book I doubt if this will clear it up.     I particularly remember Klein's description of 1990 South Africa and how the international consultants focused on the 2nd tier people in the new government while everybody celebrated Mandela's rise to the top.  I wonder if this still has anything to do with the continued poverty among the Africans.      I originally reviewed this before I had finished because I hoped it would generate some feedback concerning my note about Professor Freidman.  Now I would give Klein a 5 star rating but can't find a way to do this.

B001J8EVVG|4.0|I enjoyed this episode of Stargate Atlantis mostly because of the character development of Woolsey.     It's a shame that Stargate Atlantis has been canceled, because I have been pleasantly surprised by Woolsey's actions in this episode and his overall development as the leader of SGA. He was learning to see that sometimes you just could not always do everything \\"by the book.\\" and as a result he did some very suprising things in this episode that I would never have thought him of doing in the past. What would have been in store for him in a season six? Sadly we will never know.     Yes, it is a \\"clip show\\" but I enjoyed Woolsey's development. For me the first few minutes of the show and the last part when Woolsey shows up and the only really good parts.
B000UGG39Q|4.0|I judge, Down's sound has matured further.  This third album holds a new energy but still maintains the distinguished Down sound.  Heavy, thick guitars that touch the chords of blues at times.  Phil Anselmo furthers his range of vocals and offers, what I judge to be, a new side of himself.  Although not as heavy as I judge NOLA to be, Down still presents their classic heavy riff-laden guitar mastery.
031606792X|3.0|I finally finished this book just today. I'm not sure exactly how I feel about it. Ultimately, I am happy there was a happy ending between Edward and Bella. In the long run these are really the characters I cared the most about. What the heck, it's a fantasy, so I was satisfied with the ending. There were one or two things in this volume that left me a little perplexed, confused, and disappointed. One, the whole pregnancy thing. Hmmm. I know Bella was human and able to conceive. I know that the female vampires cannot conceive. So what's up with the male vampires being able to?? Where was the explanation?? According to SM, these vampires don't need sleep, they don't cry, they don't need food, heck, they don't even need to use the bathroom. So why is that Edward was able to do that, uh, \\"thing\\" that is required in order to make a baby?? It just seemed odd that for someone with no normal bodily functions he was able to conveniently perform that one task. It was just strange to me. Two, the baby. I understood why Edward was upset about the pregnancy. I know it was all fear. I was glad when he was able to read the baby's thoughts that he started to come around and be happy about it....until.....Jacob comes along and imprints on her. I know people are upset about the whole imprinting on a baby thing, which I do get. But I think what upset me the most about it was that it seemed like there was no bond with Edward to Renesmee. I kept waiting for these loving scenes of Edward cradling her and being her \\"daddy\\", but it seemed like it became Jacob's baby and Edward got completely cut out of the deal. I kept reading about Rosalie holding her, Jacob holding her, Bella holding her, but where was Edward?? It just felt very cold to me. I felt like Edward was a distant stepfather or something and it really dissapointed me. I imagined that Edward and Bella creating a baby together would be such an immense joy to him, and that he would be gushing with pride over it. I just didn't buyit at all. And lastly, back to Jacob. In the very beginning of the series, I was anti-Jacob. I knew right off the bat I wanted to see Edward and Bella be together. Jacob did win me over a bit by New Moon just because he was so sweet. I still didn't want Bella and him together, but I will say when he begged Bella to stay with him and she left it broke my little heart in two. He really grew on me as her friend, and as the third part of their love triangle. I liked the competitiveness between him and Edward. But when the baby was born and he imprinted on her, it felt like the real Jacob just vanished!! I know his character was still there, but it felt like THE Jacob got booted from the story as a part of a big cop-out. I wished Jacob could have lost the battle for Bella with some dignity instead of having his relief just handed to him on a platter the moment he looked in Renesmee's eyes. COP-OUT. I still give it at least 3 stars because I was happy to see them get their happy ending. I will admit though, Bella being a vampire just wasn't the same. I missed her living with Charlie and her love with Edward being so \\"forbidden\\" and sensual. I still love this series. I just kind of wish this final book would have taken things slightly differently.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|Just picked this up after a friend told me about it. I am an old timer, remember AC/DC in the Bon Scott days and then later, when Back In Black and Those About To Rock were released. I stopped listening to then around Fly On The Wall because the arrangements were starting to sound over produced and the problems with Brian Johnson's voice.<br /><br />THIS is the AC/DC I remember from the good old days. In your face, no apologies straight up edgy rock and roll with an attitude problem. Whatever the problem was with Johnston's voice is history -- it's different from the old days, but on key and gutsy (not shrill).<br /><br />And the best part, the mix is AWESOME. The hard right channel opening guitar riff of \\"Rock 'n' Roll Train\\" just about blew me out of the driver's seat of my truck (500 watts helps). The bass is fantastically clean and punchy. Not over compressed like a lot of rock mixes these days (like a certain recent \\"brand M\\" release).<br /><br />This ones going in the iTunes library tonight, in it's entirety. Get it, get it now -- this is AC/DC goodness in its purest form.
B001GAOY5U|4.0|This movie is fun and exciting. The graphic effect was great. This movie is impressive. It's action and adventure movie. you have to watch it. This movie contained 2-D and 3-D. that's great. It's good movie. You can realize the movie with 3-D Edition. It's fun.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|If you've seen Robert Altman's \\"The Player,\\" you've seen the stereotypical Hollywood pitch - \\"It's 'Deliverance' meets 'Ordinary People' meets 'Marathon Man,' but it's got a heart.\\"  Movies are defined by how they reference other movies - that's how they get sold in today's bottom-line driven, play-it-safe Hollywood culture.    \\"Cloverfield\\" was easily pitched as \\"It's 'Blair Witch' meets 'Godzilla' meets 'Aliens' meets 'Friends,' with a paean to 9/11 thrown in.\\"  Adopting the same fiction of \\"BW\\" - that we've found the videotape capturing horrific yet mostly unseen events happening to real people - \\"Cloverfield\\" tells the thankfully-terrifying tale of a gargantuan monster tearing apart Manhattan.      Unfortunately, while we cared about Heather, Josh and Mike to some degree in \\"BW,\\" we really can't muster up any empathy for the cadre of uber-hip twenty-somethings \\"Cloverfield\\" throws us into.  These are obviously people who dress according to magazine covers and have memorized the cliched roles from \\"Friends.\\"  There's a Ross-Rachel love story going on involving two leads, while the guy's brother and best friend throw him a going-away party that the best friend videotapes.  This follows the tired cliche of everyone on the tape talking about the lovers' \\"secret undying love for each other.\\"  The guy is even going to Japan, for God's sake, just like Ross did in a plot contrivance to keep the Ross-Rachel story \\"interesting\\" for another bloated season.    This tripe occupies the first fifteen minutes, and then thankfully the monster shows up.  The movie's handling of the monster is its greatest strength, as the monster is shown in terrifying glimpses and quick shots.  This thing is a behemoth, destroying the Brooklyn Bridge with an accidental swipe of its tail.  Perhaps more terrifying, it drops space-lice from its skin that are miniature demons straight out of \\"Starship Troopers\\" crossed with the baddies from \\"Aliens.\\"  This is scary stuff.    The story follows our intrepid band of twits as they try to first escape Manhattan and then to save the girlfriend, Beth.  Manhattan is destroyed, convincingly, by both the monster and the U.S. Army.  The movie never really explains what's going on, and this leads to several truly terrifying and shocking moments I won't spoil here.  But this part of the movie is what \\"Godzilla\\" should have been.    Unfortunately, the videotape of the carnage is recorded over the lovers' tryst, so we get perfectly-timed snippets of their relationship-bliss intercut with the action.  If we cared about these two, I suppose it would rise to powerful stuff a la \\"Titanic,\\" but since we don't, the love story is an annoying distraction.    Much has been made of the jerky handicam style of the movie.  I saw it on DVD, so the TV screen was probably more merciful than a full size movie screen.  But I think those who are nauseated by the jerkiness of the camera are reflecting their distaste for the characters.  After all, when Steven Spielberg went all herky-jerky with the opening scenes of \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" it was hailed as a high-water mark of filmmaking. There's a great difference between watching the storming of Normandy than there is watching the lives of twits being rent asunder, colossal monster or no colossal monster.
031606792X|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who likes the three books before, or at least Twilight and Eclipse. It is the best book of the series and even though the ending bothered me for a while, it was the best possible.
0792839749|3.0|This was purchesed for my son who loves anything in the world of travel. His birthday isn't until Nov. so he hasn't watched it yet. The product came quickly just as advertised.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|So this album gained dust as I felt the lost their edge......    Last month it came out again out of just \\"look here I forgot I had this\\"    OMG - What an album. Seriously go back and listen, its so well written, its stunning.    This has been so overlooked - I think they also read the instant reviews and went on to do another loud album but they were on the right track with this album - So on track we lost them and have now caught up.    Do a music lover a favor and listen to this again and one more time and I am sure you will hear what I have been hearing the last few months.    sorry BRMC for not working out what you were doing before.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Good stuff!  The Blu-ray looks great. And its nice to know that more Iron Man is coming in 2010.
006088732X|5.0|I haven't the faintest idea of whether this book is good or bad.  All I know is that my 12-year old granddaughter loves the series, and she has managed to be a teriffic kid despite it, and anything that gets her to read is a good thing.
1577314808|5.0|...the present moment is all you ever have. \\"There is never a time when your life is not this moment.\\" This passage from the book, hit me like a ton of bricks. Why am I worrying about the past and the future? I'm just putting myself through a type of \\"hell\\" on earth. My problems are not occurring right now, they either already happened or I'm projecting a problem into the future, I can not change them now! Why bother worrying? Why not find peace and happiness in my own present moment.<br /><br />This is an excellent book. I found it at the perfect time after reading a marriage self-help book that was based on self-differentiation. This book is helping me \\"hold onto my true self\\" not my mind made self, but the self that is underneath all emotional baggage.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!
0345357116|5.0|I read this book very quickly because I was so fascinated by all the works that Tolkien left unfinished at the time of his death. His son did a beautiful job of compiling these works into an organized book and I really enjoyed it.
0380820846|5.0|I am a late comer to romance books. Two years ago desperate for something to read, I reached into my wife's book stash and plucked a romance out. Much to my surprise, I not only enjoyed it but I found that nightmares that had been plaguing me for years stopped. Now I'm addicted to the lady's and lads of the Regency era and their romantic triumphs and failures.    Happily, I stumbled upon the Bridgerton series quite by accident and after enjoying the first several came upon the story of Colin Bridgerton and Penelope Featherigton and found my favorite romance genre heroine and my favorite Bridgerton offspring brilliantly matched. Most regency era heroines strive to be like Penelope: witty, intelligent, and funny, but usually come across as strident and unlikeable or so unrealistically independent and demanding that they sound like a 21st century woman pasted into the early 19th century. Penelope, however, manages to be many wonderful things but never unrealistic to the time period or full of herself.    Colin is the devil-may-care rake that actually comes across as having a heart of gold. The book is so marvelously well-written that you not only believe these two people could have actually existed in regency-era London, you find yourself rooting for them both...hard! If you want to read an enjoyable series discover the Bridgertons, but if you want true magic: read this one!
B001E1DJD4|5.0|After a four year delay, Rachael Yamagata returns to her fans with her second album \\"Elephants...Teeth Sinking Into Heart...\\". The two-disc album features an older, bolder and more mature Rachael. The first disc, \\"Elephants\\" consists of slower, piano-based songs that warms one's heart while listening though they convey rather heart-breaking lyrics. The opening song \\"Elephants\\", which is the album's title and the inspiration behind it, is just so poetical and soft and fragile. The first disc also features the instrumental version of the song which is just as beautiful . A 9-minute version of Rachael's one of best songs, \\"Sunday Afternoon\\" also gives the listeners a perfect perspective of Rachael's main inspirations, which are her heart breaks and failed relationships. The disc also has \\"Duet\\", a beautiful ballad with Ray LaMontagne. \\"Brown Eyes\\" has vocals from Maria Taylor, another favorite of mine. The second disc, \\"Teeth Sinking Into Heart\\", features Ms. Yamagata \\"rocking out\\" with more guitar based, faster songs, though it has its slow moments with \\"Pause The Tragic Ending\\" and \\"Don't\\".<br />I ordered the album from Turkey and waited almost three weeks for delivery, but it was worth the wait, and even more. Rachael Yamagata is simply amazing and deserves more and more attention.
0385340990|5.0|This is one of the rare times when a series of letters works perfectly to reveal characters that seem real and stories that really happened.  We, my husband and I, so thoroughly loved this book, its setting, its history, and its humor.  Now we want to go to Guernsey.  After all these years, this period of history still has lessons for us and the talented authors told them well.  It is a grief that Ms. Shaffer did not live to see the book not only accepted and appreciated, but truly loved.
B0009KPENO|5.0|Once when I was in high school, I wanted a pair of these shoes that everyone had.  I get a lot of comments about them now and hear so many stories.  I've told many people where I got them so, do I get a finders fee?
B001CDLATE|5.0|i had originally seen this on dvd back in college, and proceeded to watch it often; every time i had a research paper or an art/graphics project. Very inspiring stuff. A lot of hidden beauty in this movie. great music, cinematography (wonderful colors - complimentary often)...i couldn't recommend this more highly.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|Not an art movie--not quite an epic--but a regular costumer, in what has become a culture with Focus Films: Make as many movies about Elizabeth I, or her relatives and historical milieu. This time it is about her mother, Ann Boleyn, but the story--slow moving at first--let's us know about her younger sister, Mary, and her manipulative uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, who sees it is an opportunity to further his family's interests by promoting her as the prospective mistress of his king, who else, the infamous Henry the VIII.  She is married already, and that makes it easier, for the king need not bother with her virginhood.  Mary has a child with Henry and then is abandoned; his interest now turns to her sister, Ann, who had been in France a while, \\"educating\\" herself in court manners. Now she is a daring woman who has the temerity to exchange witticism with the mighty king. She defies him to marry her, something that will cost England a rift with the Pope. All this is well known stuff of history, and the movie does not bother with much detail. But when Ann seems to go too far, fails to produce a male heir, and thence is beheaded; that simple. The details of two beheadings, for she has to be found guilty of something--incest with her brother--are gruesome, and both she and her brother undergo the usual decapitation process, he with an ax, his head on a block, she by a horizontal hit with a blade that cuts off her head while she knees, and her head and neck are in vertical position.<br /><br />Eric Bana, who plays Henry, makes an effort to make this male monster's tale sympathetic--after all he has to have a son!--but, in this one of his weakest performances, only succeeds in giving the viewer a bag of inconsistencies, for Henry seems beyond redemption--whatever his reasons.  Natalie Portman and Scarlet Johanssen give creditable performances, and the rest of the cast is on the excellent side, in this tale which nothing but a repetition of royal sins and monstrous inhumanities.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|(This review is of the BluRay edition with 3D glasses)  I won't re-review the movie content: the main theatrical review is accurate and I agree with it.  I'm commenting on the 3D effect only.    The movie comes with red/blue 3D glasses (4 pair). The 3D effect is pretty good, but as with all red/blue 3D, the effect goes mostly into the screen, not out from the screen. Theatrical 3D with polarized lenses do both, but that is not technically possible with TV. But it is entertaining, none the less.    The big downside: you wanted a color movie, right? Well, red/blue 3D glasses essentially eliminate color. Everything is very muted, almost sepia in appearance. Look at the same scene in 3D, then in 2D (or just take off the glasses), and you'll quickly see what you are missing.    Overall, I wish they'd stop with this color-robbing 3D stuff on DVD and BluRay. It's a gimmick and removes the reason I have a color TV the first place.

B000O1799U|3.0|I suspect one's reaction to this movie depends a lot on how one responds to the music. I could admire the performances, especially Hudson's, and some of the numbers were really rousing. Others were not. I must admit I had to fast-forward through more than one semi-operatic number.<br />This story seems to mirror the history of Diana Ross and the Supremes. Not being an expert, I have no idea how much of it is factual and how much merely semi-factual. The contrived \\"happy ending\\" was certainly the latter.<br />So, the pluses: some of the musical numbers, Hudson's performance, also Eddie Murphy who puts in a tremendous performance, his best for years.<br />The minuses: too long, too many tuneless tunes, cliched acting, especially by Foxx who is peculiarly wooden. Beyonce is incredibly beautiful but her talent is outshone by Hudson's.<br />Definitely worth renting but it's not a true classic.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Its not your old \\"average vampire\\" show. The characters are strong and the plot keeps you watching weekly. It s definitely worth watching a few shows of it......and let you decide from there.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I am a big fan of the show, so I had to purchase this dvd.  I have to admit, though, that my expectations were pretty low.  I thought the movie would be overly glamourized, and not have much substance to it.  However, when I saw the movie, I was so pleasantly surprised.  It was like the icing on the cake.  The storylines were much deeper than I would have thought they would have been.  This was a really emotional movie.  I loved it, and can't think of how it could have been a better conclusion to the story of the show.  And every character had a lot going on -- it wasn't just about Carrie.  It was pure perfection!  Highly recommend.  Definitely an very enjoyable movie.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Before I go into the visual and interpretive masterpiece that is Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, let me begin by asserting my firm belief that Shakespeare was meant to be experienced, not merely poured over.  While the language is obviously crucial to understanding the play as a whole, simply watching the emotional interactions and contemplations of this play can be just as powerful.  If you don't have the opportunity to see a live performance of Hamlet (which would be the real tragedy) Branagh's adaptation is probably the next best way to experience Shakespeare's masterpiece.  The majesty of the Edwardian set blends perfectly with the mysterious plot and shrouded characters and the visuals add life that viewers would expect of any performance.  Branaugh's adaptation, the full text of the original play, is consistent with basic interpretations of the plays but plays down the idea of Hamlet as truly crazy.  While Branagh certainly performs as a madman would, we clearly see it is little more than that, a performance-- something left to the interpretation of those who only read the text.  While the play may be a little melodramatic at times (namely during all the soliloquies) and the final confrontation is overly dramatized (since when was a chandelier involved?), Branagh's Hamlet is definitely the best filmed adaptation of Shakespeare's memorable tragedy.  Viewers will enjoy this film even if they haven't read the play and it is certainly coupled well with the text for those who have!
B00004TS0E|5.0|My family enjoys this movie every year. It stands up to the test of being a remake. The directors choice of stars turned out great too. Make popcorn, put your feet up and have fun.
0954510364|5.0|It was the fabulous mid-fifties and I was eight years old. Every night, my mom would read to me a chapter from \\"Treasure Island.\\" I delighted at every turn of the page. Written by Robert Louis Stevenson in 1883, \\"Treasure Island\\" is the epic tale of a young man's quest to capture a hidden treasure on the open seas. Since its first publication, it has remained one of the best-loved adventure stories of all time.<br /><br />What is little known about this wonderful novel is that it was born out of a fictitious map that was drawn by Stevenson in 1881 for his twelve-year-old grandson. From this hastily created map sprang a tale about pirates and a search for buried treasure.<br /><br />\\"Treasure Island\\" is a treasure unto itself. It should be found on every novel-lovers book shelf, especially if the novel-lover is a parent. I am now sixty years 'young' after reading once again (fifty-two years later) the book that fired my childhood imagination. Buy it! Read it! Sailing the bounty blue mane under the black flag and the vivid imagination of Robert Louis Stevenson is the best medicine that I know of for lifting your spirit and igniting the adventurous soul within you. Argh, Matey, it may even be the best remedy for pathological depression.
0786939532|5.0|Epic. Masterful. Stunning. Immersive. Spell-binding.    From the very beginning of this novel and this trilogy I found myself captivated and intrigued by the magic of the story. R.A. Salvatore is simply an amazing writer. The characters seem very real; they are well-developed and possess a degree of tragedy, but not to the point that they become distant or vague concepts. The descriptive writing will paint beautiful and unforgettable mental landscapes, from the regal comfort of the Do'Urden home to the caverns and tunnels of the Underdark. There's also quite a bit of action, interesting creatures, and even subtle hints of humor and levity.    With that said, the most remarkable thing about this novel is the creation of a timeless, heroic figure: Drizzt Do'Urden. Drizzt is truly intriguing through and through. His personal struggle in an immoral, loveless world is fascinating. Many times I found myself feeling his pain and anger but also sympathizing with his joy. Somehow, this make-believe dark elf is all too real and substantial.    When I first picked Homeland up, I didn't realize the power within. I found myself addicted and read through the entire trilogy almost non-stop. I have now bought most of the collection and certainly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a fine read!
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|This is a beautiful production, and of course, Cate is terrific. Clive Owen smolders as Sir Walter Raleigh, overall, a wonderfully entertaining movie.
B001CD6FKI|1.0|Did not care for the movie at all.  It appears to have been made for children but was laced with profanity and crudeness.  We gave it away to a friend.
6305076995|4.0|Although the product is not top-quality photography, the close-ups and clarity are not par to today's technology, or maybe even at that time, this may be the best Yes concert on film in their early years.  Yes is one of the most talented groups of musicians and composers of the last 40 years, and continues to tour with  original members this year.  To me, they did reach their peak of live-performing talent about 15 years after this tour, however.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|Brendan Fraser is a scientist looking for the center of the earth in this entertaining film.  Josh Hutcherson is a fine young actor who is really good in this movie.  Anita Briem is a talented lovely actress.  I have never heard of her before, but she gives a good performance as a mountain guide. The visual effects are excellent.  This movie is a treat to watch in 3D.  I love the floating rocks and the furious flying fish in the movie.<br /><br />I really liked the special features on this DVD. It features a commentary on every scene of the movie with Brendan Fraser and the director Eric Brevig.  This DVD also features an interview with Josh Hutcherson about his life as a young actor.  There are some fun games to play based on the movie included in this DVD too.  There is another documentary talking the history of scientific discovery on this DVD.  This is also interesting to watch.  I really enjoyed watching the movie and checking out all the special features.
0739367676|5.0|[[ASIN:031606792X Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga, Book 4)]] Great book!  Couldn't put it down.

0452289963|5.0|I found this book to be very insightful.  I've read it twice already and had to purchase a second book just to give away!  It's so important to realize we're more than this one person here on earth, we're only part of a whole.  It doesn't matter if your a high executive, the President or someone who scrapes by on minimum wage, we are the same inside. I hope some day we can work more as a group, caretaker of earth and all life here, for a better life for us all now and the future.

B001DU8T6S|3.0|I give this album 3 stars.  I'm not going into the laborious task of explaining each song.  Brian May's guitar work is wonderful as always.  Even his approach is a bit more loose and bluesy than most of his previous works.  Paul Rodgers sings pretty good, and Roger Taylor's drumming is a bit out of his element when it comes to the songs that Paul has written for this album.  It's is a modern classic rock album that is well recorded, but in the end nothing new.  This album does not resemble much of Queen as you all expected, but I do not like the collaboration with Paul Rodgers for 3 reasons.  He is a legendary singer, but a bit awkward in this line up.  My first reason is because I do not think that Paul Rodgers is a good songwriter.  Even his solo and Bad Company albums have very simple and weak lyrics, but are forgiven by his vocal power delivery.  Second reason is the vocal range was too much in the middle for a Queen album.  That might be a weak reason for some, but my  third reason has to do with  Roger Taylor.  He is more involved in the songwriting and I always thought in the past Queen albums his contribution to writing maybe 2 songs was enough.  This album also sounds a bit more in the direction of Bad Company.  Queen is not a blues based band.  Paul, Brian and Roger should not have produced this album.  Another producer would have pointed out some of the bad lyrics like \\"Surfs up schools out I got a criminal urge to twist and shout.\\"   Also this album sounds very simple, and a Queen album was anything but that.  Also not much on the back vocals department that has made Queen legendary.  Now I know those who crossed the Paul Rodgers river are asking me why am I judging this as a Queen album?  Maybe because Brian May and Roger Taylor are still carrying the name Queen.  This album has shown that maybe they should drop that name.  Queen is dead without John Deacon and  Freddie Mercury.  They should call themselves another name and I would still buy theiralbums.  Their are some Queen moments, but not much in my opinion.
0142000671|5.0|I read the book in 7th grade, but didn't know what a [...] house was. I read it again, just because I remembered how fun it was to read the beautiful way Steinbeck captures street talk. What I appreciate about the book as an adult is that Lenie, the mentally retarded character, was not able to rationalize at the begining of the book and Steinbeck made no indication that he could. At the end of the book, suddenly, Lenie's able to rationalize the consequences of his actions and fears rejection because he's done something bad. Other then that little, really minor, flaw, I love to read his books.
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|A solid outing from top to bottom by AC/DC.  Some songs are better than others, but there's no filler music here.  As for one reviewer's take on Brian Johnson \\"about-to-die\\" voice....I actually like it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I purchased this cd shortly after it came out.  It is a cd I put on when I want to gentle my mind.  Her voice is warm and her phrasing is perfection.  Every time winter comes around I listen to her constantly..Especially if it's rainy and cold.  Her music just beckons for a glass of warm wine and a good book.  A must have for any music lover. The songs \\"don't know why\\" & \\"come away with me\\" illustrate the great things about being in love and all of it's dynamics.
0132350882|5.0|This book belongs on the shelf of every java developer.  Buy it.  Not only does it cover \\"what\\" clean code is, it talks in great detail about \\"why\\" something is clean or not clean.    This book has one tiny flaw: the font used for code is not the most readable.  The publisher could learn a thing or two from O'Reilly, who uses much better fonts.
031606792X|4.0|I was so caught up in this series!!  I am a 28 yr old mom of 3, and from the time I picked up Twilight to the moment I finished Breaking Dawn ( a week later)I think I put everything else to the side.  To quote Edward-this was my kind of heroin!  I know that people are being very critical of Breaking Dawn for various reasons, but I have to say that when I read the last page I was not disappointed in the ending.  I was left wanting to know more-and that is why I hope that SM progresses with Midnight Sun.  I could not stop myself from reading her online posting-and I loved what she had written.  I think having the opportunity to see not only Edward's point of view, but also that of every one else in Forks and the Cullens makes the story that much deeper.  It really develops people on a way we did not see when we just had Bella's point of view.  **Spoiler Alert**Don't proceed if you don't want to know!  I only really wanted a couple of things from BD:  Bella to become a vampire, and for her and Edward to be able to be happy.  As for Renesmee-I would have used the middle name she chose \\"Carlie\\"- I think it would have flowed better.  It would have been cool to see Bella act on some newborn rage and pave the way for her and Emmett and the others to take out the Volturi.  I did like that she was not a completely out of control newborn.    Overall though, I was happy with the series and hope that SM will continue it from Edward's perspective.  I would read the entire series this way of she were to write it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|It was far beyond my expectations. A movie of top quality.  Of course a movie cannot compare to the actual book- but this comes as close as any possibly can.  Absolutely brilliant!
0345479092|4.0|Got this book from the library and then liked it so well, I bought it.  Advice is middle of the road - a balance between letting baby rule your life and making sure baby needs are met while still meeting your needs.  Haven't had the baby yet to apply the advice to, but the book is easy to follow and it's easy to find topics you need help with.  I guess I won't know til later whether the advice really works.
B00003CX8V|4.0|Great film, this is Shirley McLaine and Jack Lemmon at there best.We see  two lonely people look for love in all the wrong places.
015206057X|5.0|Dear little babies with their characteristically busy little fingers and stubby little playdough toes delight the reader with their realism. Thank you, Helen Oxenbury! A singalong rhythm that is \\"easy to read to\\" encourages the listener to join in after a couple of repeats. Thank you, Mem Fox!<br /><br />Although these two gifted women had \\"retired\\", this book, and the Baby World, is as fresh and light-hearted as these babies are. Focusing on the similarities rather than the differences, their message of peace is tenderly and subtly played. I can't wait to give this as a baby gift!
0307455874|4.0|This is the 2nd book by Barack Obama. Though I absolutely loved the first book DREAMS OF MY FATHER I do not believe that this book accomplished all of what I feel it was trying to accomplish. I think that Obama was trying to tie together his early experiences in politics with the policies and issues now facing our country but in the end he did not succeed in fitting it all together just right. Through out the book I found myself most interested in his personal experiences more so than with his specific thoughts on a particular policy. Maybe if the book was a bit longer it would have come together better. Don't let this detour you from reading the book though. Many of the questions that you may have on how Obama would run the country are right here in black and white and what a beautiful vision he has for the future of our country.
0060899190|4.0|This is a gorgeous book. I had no idea what it was going to be before I bought it but I love it! It is a little insight into what is going on in different peoples lives...
0739325760|5.0|I have liked Barack Obama ever since he stopped to speak in the small Iowa town that I was living for the past few years. He has a true sincerity that can instantly be felt and he comes across as a very likable person. My Husband and I decided to read this book as well as THE AUDACITY OF HOPE before giving the man our vote and let me tell you I am glade we did. From reading the story of his life you understand how Obama has been shaped as a man and a politician. Every issue that the US is facing today is seen in the life of Barack and his family. The story was very elegant, thought provoking and all inclusive in it's view of the world. Any American can read this book and see there self in Obama's experiences. Based on this book I believe Obama will be a wonderful president of the likes never before seen in these modern days.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Enjoy the music, laughter, greek islands, and cute boys. This is the number 1 musical for me. I loved the movie and have seen it five times in theathers. I am glad to know \\"the dancing queen\\" is coming to dvd because I am 17 this year. My favorite song in the movie though is \\"Does Your Mother Know.\\" I am getting really dizzy and I am not broken hearted anymore. I recommend anyone to see this and own it. I knew it was going to be on this special 2 disc DVD. I hope you get wild and let feel it. I think everyone is the Dancing Queen!! What special features I know will be deleated scenes, behind the scenes, and many other fabulous moments at the making of this film. Meryl Streep has brought the role of a women to be strong, funny, and always having that feeling of being young again. Remember to SOS this DVD. Chao!!!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Halloween-the ORIGINAL-was released in 1978.  I don't think I've ever had as much fun at a movie as I did when I first saw this.  The entire audience was mesmerized by what was unfolding on the screen.  We all screamed, shouted instructions to the people on the screen, and held our breath through every scene.  The tension was unbelievable.  John Carpenter (who has never come close to topping this one) proved he was a master at building suspense and definitely chosing the \\"less-is-more\\" type of violence.  Why it was labeled as a \\"slasher\\" film is still a mystery because there is little to no blood shown.<br /><br />The original Halloween was an independent film and shot on a shoestring budget.  With really no known actors (it did introduce Jamie Lee Curtis) and a still wet-behind-the-ears director, the film at first only received a limited distribution.  But word-of-mouth took care of that, and soon the film was everywhere.  Roger Ebert gave it 3-1/2 stars (out of 4) and his review said, \\"[I]t will have you screaming.\\"<br /><br />You all know the story:  babysitter Laurie Strode battles the indestructible and masked Michael Meyers, and the audience is treated to one of the best rollercoaster rides they'll ever experience.  The music used in the film is just as memorable as the screeching violins used in Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Psycho.\\"  Not to be confused with the damning remake by Rob Zombie, this is a must-see for any horror buff.  Comparably tame to anything released today, the movie last 92 minutes and is rated R for brief nudity, violence, and some adult language.<br /><br />The true test of any classic movie is \\"can it withstand the tests of time?\\"  Halloween (the original) has indeed done that.  I never miss when it's on television and I also own several of the movies.  As is most cases, the original is always the best.  The plotline of this movie has been copied by just about everyone in the horror genre.  The majority of those films failed miserably because all they were interested in was the body count.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.n was the body count.     HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
1401207510|2.0|As other reviewers have commented on the ridiculous price and lack of any additional materials in this \\"absolute\\" edition, I'll skip that although I agree with what they said.<br /><br />The book presents the continuing adventures of Murray and Quatermain, here younger versions of themselves fleeing a post-Big Brother-post-WWII world.  Their adversary is Jimmy, grandson of Campion Bond from Volume 1.  Like his ancestor, Jimmy at best is semi-competent; unlike his ancestor he seems to enjoy success with the ladies.  The graphic portions of the text are interspersed with mostly-prose segments of the 'Black Dossier' itself, and detail how Murray knocks Jimmy's teeth out, steals the 'Black Dossier' itself, and then rejoins Quatermain for a boring escape to a boring alternate-reality.  It is 3-D, and that's the best thing you can say for it.  Sound like it would have taken up about 3 panes in Volume 1?  Yep.  Here it's an agonizing multi-page affair.  So much for the graphic portions.<br /><br />The mostly-prose 'Black Dossier' itself is similar to the lengthy Travelogue at the end of Volume 2, except less interesting, much longer, and written in a bunch of affected styles that make reading it a trying and numbing experience.  If you like to think you're piecing together some sort of coherent storyline assembled from innuendo, poor spelling, and gigantic run-on sentences, maybe you'll like it.  To me, it's pretty much crap.  Sad to think that such an exceptional beginning (Volume 1) ran through a humdrum conclusion (Volume 2) and then gets smeared by association with this ending...
0380018179|5.0|I am a reader. I love reading classics, plays, all kinds of things. Yet, when people ask me what my *all time* favorite is, it is The Thorn Birds.  When telling people about it, it seems kind of like a trashy novel, not real \\"literature\\".  I can't describe it, it is just SO GOOD.  The story is wonderful, more then just a love story.  There is a web of amazingly rich characters that you end up caring about.  Mary Carson is one of the best characters in the story, yet she is only in a fraction of the book.  Luke O'Neil, Paddy, Fee, Justine, even Mrs. Smith the housekeeper are such well developed characters with their own sorrows and joys.  Another reviewer mentioned how it transports you to Australia.  I totally agree.  You can almost see the landscape, feel the heat, hear the sheep...  Honestly, whenever I need a pick me up because my own life is just too stressful and I want to escape, this is the first book I go too.

1569242739|5.0|I bought this book because I was looking for interesting cupcake recipes on the internet.  I saw a picture of pistachio rosewater cupcakes and found out that the recipe came from this book.  I am not nor have ever been remotely vegan, but I bought it anyway.  Every single recipe that I've tried so far has been wonderful and delicious - oreo, peanut butter, maple, low-fat vanilla, red velvet, and pistachio rosewater - all so yummy!  And if I don't have the right soy products in my house, then I substitute with dairy and they still turn out great.      I agree with one of the other reviews that was disappointed with the unhealthiness of the cupcakes, but they ARE cupcakes, I guess I wasn't expecting them to be super healthy.     This book has gotten me into the kitchen, which was a rarity before.  I love it and recommend it to everyone I know.

B001DMJ9R4|5.0|I'm above 40 and in a league of older rock bands such as AC/DC, Skid Row, Metallica, Dio.    This new rock band really rock me out when I first heard their album by chance... played from one of the record store at my place.    This DVD and CD is definitely not a waste of your dollar spent...if you are hardcore fan of this band like me..    hope this band would one day (in the next twenty years) become one of the legend bands as above..

B0016Q2D5M|1.0|Whatever the merits of the actual movie, the 3D process used on this DVD (Green/Purple glasses) is simply awful. While the 3D might be great in the theater, this adaptation of the 3D to DVD is intolerably bad. Many 3D DVDs use colored glasses, primarily Red/Cyan or Red/Blue (for instance Spy Kids 3D and Polar Express 3D), but for some reason, Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D uses Green/Purple Glasses. With these glasses, the movie is unwatchable due to brightness differences between the two eyes, and the lack of any color reproduction (like watching a black and white movie tinted green.)    Perhaps Amazon could take the time to inform buyers about the 3D system employed by the DVDs they sell. Some are High Quality Field Sequential (HQFS), some are Red/Cyan anaglyph glasses, some are Red/Blue anaglyph glasses, but this is the first I've seen of the Green/Purple system. I hope it'll be my last encounter!    Summary: Totally botched 3D conversion onto DVD! Stay away!    As a side note, many buyers are not aware that some anaglyph DVDs (colored glasses) can look quite good in the home, but only so on certain playback hardware configurations. If your TV is connected to your DVD player with composite video, S-Video, or a modulator (Ch. 3-4, etc...) the colored glasses 3D effect will look terrible. This is because these connections do not provide accurate color information.    The best playback setup would be a computer monitor (either LCD or CRT), or a DVD player connected to your LCD, DLP, or CRT TV set with HDMI or component cables. Movies like Polar Express 3D or Shrek 3D look pretty good with this setup. However, even with a great playback setup, Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D, is a disaster. Remember that the studio must do a proper conversion from the in-theater polarized source material into the colored glasses source for the DVD. This is where Journey 3D got flushed. Also the choice of Green/Magenta glasses seems to have made the conversion even worse.Although the conversion from polarized to anaglyph requires skill, it is not rocket science. Warner Home Video and New Line Home owe everyone an apology (and a refund) for this botch job.
1932073221|5.0|This book explains money as a form of energy, and how to get comfortable with the idea that humans are not designed to trade time/freedom for money. The book teaches that we are designed to experience joy and spend time doing what we love to do, and then the money comes as a natural by product.  I have also read the Abraham-Hicks book \\"Money and the Law of Attraction,\\" which is a complimentary philosophy on money, but the Hicks deal more with thoughts and training yourself to think in specific ways. The two books do not contradict each other, I guess because they are teaching the truth in different ways. This book does have meditations and exercises designed to bring awareness to limiting beliefs about money, but doesn't get into as many specifics as the Abraham-Hicks.  It's a fantastic book. Super easy to read. Mine is all underlined and highlighted up. I've referred to it so many times since I changed careers a year ago.

015206396X|4.0|I am a very picky reader, I won't read most things. But, I absolutely loved this book. The plot and the characters were so new to me. Great ideas and marvelous writing was poured out onto this book. This is a great read and I would suggest it to anyone who likes a good fiction novel.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Saw it in the movie theater and thought it was GREAT. Story line was EXCELLENT.. Choice of actors was the same.. Visual and special effects seemed seamless.. I give it five stars.. The DVD was also VERY WELL done. Just the proper amount of extras, which I really like.. I recommend this to even those who don't think they like comic book characters on the big screen..
B0013ND30M|5.0|Obviously a must-have for anyone who likes a good movie. I've yet to meet someone who doesn't love Disney's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\". The special features are fun and the improvements on the color and picture are very noticable and make this even more enjoyable. Get it while you can, before it disappears. I love it.

B000LF73ZE|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who loves to read and for educators who teach Language Arts or the history of the Holocaust.  Set in WWII Germany, it is full of history, romance and heartbreak.  Most importantly, it shows the deep shame felt by those who are illiterate and go to the greatest of length to hide it.  Heartwrenching and unforgettable, I have read it twice and will read it again.
159102594X|4.0|Similar to the Fire and Ice series by George R R Martin (but on a far smaller scale) this series focuses on about 6 to 8 people fighting, scheming, torturing and killing their way through a fantastic sword and sorcery landscape. There are some humorous moments, but this is NOT a funny book. It is well written and totally engrossing and well worth the money if you enjoy fantasy novels. This first book sets the tone and the next two bring everything together.
B00000K3G8|5.0|If you have ever seen the dvd and are hoping for all of the same things this cd is the closest thing to it.  This is fantastic for anyone who wants to start listening to the Talking Heads or you have been listening to them for years.
0140274111|5.0|This book is too much fun. The success of the book (it is, of course a tremendously successful piece of writing)depends on the central character, Holly Golightly who charms not only the characters in the book but the reader as well. All of the action occurs in New York City, and the setting just enhances the plot (hence the title). The theme centers around parties, relationships and romance in a frivolous, somewhat flighty atmosphere. Capote's capacity for dialogue borders on genius. I suspect his near perfect recall for conversation helped create this character.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|While many fans were somewhat disappointed with this version, I absolutely loved it. There are a few story changes from the original Broadway Production, and some songs are missing, but I still love the story and love the performances. Johnny Depp is spot on as usual bringing the tradegy of 'Mr. Todd' right to your heart, making you feel sorry for him, and yet scaring the hell out of you at the same time. Helena Bonham Carter has never been my favorite actress, but you can tell how much dedication she puts into 'Mrs. Lovett' and I have to say she steals the show away from Depp at many points. While she is no Angela Lansbury, she still manages to take this part and make it her own. The cast is wonderful, the music entrancing, and the overall art just amazing. A definite must own guaranteed to help you have a good time. BUY IT!
0312427999|5.0|Reading \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" was one of the best investments of my reading time in many months. This is a compelling piece of journalism (perhaps more like a well-documented opinion piece) that takes you for an eye-opening trip around the world and through decades of history, examining the role of the United States and the International Monetary Fund in the manipulation of politics and economics.<br /><br />Sound heavy? It is--to a point. It's also basic and simple in concept and delivery.<br /><br />\\"The Shock Doctrine\\" exposes the scorched-earth and exploitive approach of Milton Friedman and the \\"Chicago Boys\\"--in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Poland, Russia, China, The Maldives, New Orleans, Sri Lanka and more. Using human torture as a point of comparison, Klein shows how conservative ideologues concocted a toxic mix of authoritarian power and pure free-market ideology to upend economies and disrupt lives in the name of profit. Trying to capture the essence of this book in a couple of sentences is a challenge--it's much more complex than the sentence above.<br /><br />One quick sidebar note: I found the early chapter about the history of human torture to be overly long and unnecessary. She makes a good point early on in this chapter and then drives it into the ground. If you find this chapter slow or repetitive, just skip it. The going is just getting interesting--if a bit depressing.<br /><br />In country and country, crisis after crisis, Klein shows how the super-capitalists swoop in when opportunity strikes and how they till the ground and shock the local population so massive parts of the government functions can be privatized. The result is usually harsh and brutal for those on the lowest economic rungs and Klein documents the impact--and the complicit involvement of the U.S. government.<br /><br />Additionally, \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" attacks the notion of government-by-contract and how that notion is fundamentally flawed.<br /><br />Klein has a way of telescoping world events over the past decades into sharp patterns and brutal rhythms. If you doubt there's a connection between the tsunami in Sri Lanka and Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Klein will show you.<br /><br />Klein's prose is rich and direct. \\"The recipe for endless worldwide war is the same one that the Bush administration offered as a business prospectus to the nascent disaster capitalism complex after September 11. It is not a war that can be won by any country, but winning is not the point. The point is to create `security' inside fortress states bolstered by endless low-level conflict outside their walls. In a way, it is the same goal that the private security companies have in Iraq: secure the perimeter, protect the principal.\\"<br /><br />Fascinating book.

B001CDLATE|5.0|I originally saw Baraka years ago and thought it was a cinematographic masterpiece.  Stepping up to HD and playing the regular DVD did it no justice at all.  This blu-ray disk has got to be the most fantastic in my collection.  There really are no words to describe how mind blowing this thing looks and sounds on a decent setup.  I would say this is a must have for anyone that can appreciate such a work of art.    simply fantastic and worth the wait
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  It has something for everyone!  It has intrigue, mystery, subtle humor and emotionally intense.  It was very romantic and provocative as well.  All the actors were top shelf, not only Gerard Butler, who is always superior in every role that he plays, but Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson were magnificent as well with not only their great acting ability but all three of these actors have beautiful voices.  I really, really, really loved this movie!!!

0307269752|5.0|Somewhere out there there are dozens of Goth girls with a new hero, and it's not Marilyn Manson. Her name is Lisbeth Salander, and she's tough, smart, and hard to get to know. She has a photographic memory and fantastic computer skills, and you don't want to get on her bad side.<br /><br />Lisbeth works for main character, Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative journalist who's been found guilty of libeling billionaire financial wizard Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. Blomkvist wrote an article accusing Wennerstrom of embezzling 65 million dollars from the Swedish government but was unable to substantiate part of the story. Blomkvist must serve a prison sentence but before he can clear himself, he is hired by another billionaire industrialist, Henrik Vanger, to find out what happened to his brother's daughter who disappeared almost forty years ago. Lisbeth was hired to do a background check on Mikael Blomkvist, and Henrik's lawyer recommends that Mikael hire her as a research assistant.<br /><br />The Vanger family is bad news. One of Henrik's brothers was pro-Nazi during WWII. Harriet's father was a drunkard before he drowned during one of his binges. Harriet's mother is a witch. None of the Vangers get along, which makes it hard for the company to agree on a direction. Blomkvist thinks the search for Harriet is a hopeless case, but Henrik has been obsessed with her since she disappeared and he has boxes full of evidence. He wants Blomkvist to look at them one more time. Stieg Larsson runs the reader through a maze of possible clues, most of which don't go anywhere, at least not right away, but finally Blomkvist finds a photograph that cracks the case wide open.<br /><br />Lisbeth is instrumental in both climactic scenes. She's such a multi-dimensional character. She's been declared mentally unstable; so although she's twenty-four, she must report to a guardian when she needs money. When her previous guardian dies, she's confronted with an abusive replacement whom she deals with in typical Lisbeth ingenuity. Despite her obvious talent, she has a terrible inferiority complex. She just can't believe Mikael Blomkvist could possibly see anything in her when he could have beautiful Erika Berger, Mikael`s friend and publisher.<br /><br />Author Stieg Larsson is almost as interesting as Lizbeth. He was managing editor of a magazine opposing right-wing extremism. Before he died he submitted three complete novels. He especially hated financial speculators. There's a telling quote near the end of the book: \\"...it's the financial gnomes that some tough reporter should identify and expose as traitors. They're the ones who are systematically and perhaps deliberately damaging the Swedish economy in order to satisfy the profit interests of their clients.\\" Pretty appropriate, considering what's been happening on Wall Street.<br /><br />I sure hope the next two novels are sequels and that we'll hear from Mikael and Lisbeth again. I also hope they make a movie out of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. I'm already casting the various parts.  Are you still alive Winona Ryder?genuity.

0439023483|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It kept me drawn in the whole time, to the point where I had to strain myself to put down the book. It's full of suspense, action, and surprise, but it also looks into the relationships between people, whether it be family, romantically, or between people pitted against one another. The Government is a key instigator in this novel and it shows a viewpoint oppressed people through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen. When I realized this book was part of a series I was immediately craving the next book like none other. In the meantime, I think I'll just read it again.

There are no cars allowed, just horse and buggies and bicycles, so it really feels like a trip back in time. The movie and music, esp. the music, makes the whole experience perfect. It is a beautiful love story between two beautiful people...unrequited love!....could it be more perfect?

0765316897|5.0|As I am in India, I had to wait for this book for 16 agonizing days. Once I got hold of it though, I could not stop myself but ignore everything else(like eating, sleeping) until I finished it. This is the best book yet from Brandon. He gave us the most brilliant insight to the characters in this book, particularly for Vin, Elend, Sazed and Spook.      The story is very well paced and every charpter made me hold my breath as I became more and more anxious as to how the world will cope up with all the problems narrated in the book. The characters became so real to me that I felt the same feelings the characters felt when I am reading their view point. It has the most spectacular ending which put me into a state of peaceful happiness which is seldom found in books.     All in all, I recommend this book and the entire series as well as all the Brandon's books (old or future). So, Please buy the books and enjoy them. Please do not let the negative reviews change your mind in buying these books. They are amazing..
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|\\"The Illusionist\\" does not fail to entertain.  The film satisfies a wide audience with its ability to weave romance, mystery, and suspense all into one plot.  Right from the beginning of the film, the understated texture of the film adds an appealing aesthetic quality that draws the audience to wonder what secrets and illusions lie deeper below the surface.<br /><br />The beginning scene sets the stage for the rest of the film.  Eisenheim (Edward Norton) performs a scandalous magic trick on stage that causes terror and fright in his audience.  Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamati) then attempts to arrest Eisenheim on the account of disturbing the peace.  The rest of the film follows a back and forth movement of events that gradually reveal the mystery of Eisenheim's past, present, and future.<br /><br />All of the events in the movie revolve around the young adolescent love between Eisenheim and his beloved Sophie (Jessica Biel) that ended when Sophie's family separated her from Eisenheim.  Their love seems tragically lost until they are reunited by chance 15 years later.  At the time, Sophie is more or less betrothed to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) and seems set to marry him until fate brings Eisenheim back to her. The strange thing about their evolving love is that things aren't always what they seem.  The two lovers experience joy and tragedy through dramatic events.  The audience may be convinced that Eisenheim and Sophie's love is all but lost...until an unforeseen twist is revealed.<br /><br />Even though \\"The Illusionist\\" is more or less a romance story, it will entertain multiple audiences.  There is no real in-depth character development, but the mysteriousness of each character helps to add to the enigmatic theme of the plot.  Each scene of the movie leads the audience to question and predict the acts and motives of the great Eisenheim.  Viewers may think they have solved the mystery of the lovers, but they will be astonished by the small details that are gradually revealed throughout the film.<br /><br />\\"The Illusionist\\" possesses uniqueness in its delivery of plotline.

0312427573|4.0|Although I have enjoyed some of Tom Wolfe's early nonfiction work, Bonfire languished on my shelf, unread, for several years. For some reason, I had dry and boring in mind for this book, which turn out patently untrue.    To the reader who expects a true picture of gritty life in a big city, or a real picture of relations between groups of people, as other reviewers have called this, look elsewhere! Bonfire is satire...it is exaggeration...it is a farce.     Great truths, however, often lie in humor. Wolfe has created a world where the reader manages to despise just about every character. You may be at least indifferent to the cops, or Fitzgibbon, the assistant DA who still seems to have his head on straight, but these characters just provide enough temperance to remind you how you hate everyone else.    Wolfe's use of the English language is something like Shakespeare meets tabloid journalist, and his verbiage never fails to trigger an emotion, or two, often laughter and anger or despair at the same time.     I often found I could not put the book down, but unfortunately,it seemed at the moments of highest suspense, the wordiness begins to drag, slowing the pace to a crawl, when you'd most like to fly.

B0017MO10U|1.0|I read all those wonderful reviews and then watched the film.  I was disappointed and felt like another reviewer - let down.     I have been a Stargate SG1 and Stargate Alantis fan for years.  It was cool to see them together for a brief few moments but then it turned out to be another episode.  Where was the originality, the interaction, the character development?  This movie could have rocked the house instead I went and made dinner.  Returning to realize I didn't need to rewind.  Admittedly, I did rewind the first time but then didn't bother for the second and third.  I was getting bored.    I wish it was more and I think the disappointment was in I expected it to be more than just another episode.  Everything was so predictable - a cash cow.     I am so glad I rented.  I won't waste my money.

B000T05R8Q|5.0|Up to this point I had never owned The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. I'd owned all the other Floyd albums, but this has really got me stoked.  I'd always tended to shy away from Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd, but this set has changed my mind.  The Mono and Stereo versions coupled with the alternative versions and singles have given me a new found respect for the genius that was Syd.  Some of it sounds dated to the psychedelic 60's, but most of it seems timeless and captures the imagination, taking me back to a psche-developing english childhood gone by and longed-for.  A very intriguing look into the mind of a musical/artistic genius, whom we lost far too soon.
0596009208|4.0|Although I have granted this book 4 stars -- a pretty favorable rating -- mine is another one of those dissenting opinions you will see in the current set of reviews.<br /><br />I have given 4 stars because I think the Head First folks' aims are laudable; however (and this is a big however), for me the approach simply doesn't work, and I feel as though if I'd spent a little time with the book prior to ordering it I would have given it a miss.<br /><br />My point here is that since it is the approach that is the real selling point here, it's worth your while trying to figure out whether the approach works for you or (as it did in my case) gives you a headache, and makes you wish for more traditional, meaning-bearing prose.<br /><br />The harsh version of what I am fumbling towards saying here is that, for me, this book is the triumph of widgets. I recall a Perl 5 book from some years back that I used and liked ... but I recall detractors (the author, a really fine and well-known writer on Perl, included) saying that the book had been near-ruined with text widgets and icons and other such stuff. The Head First books, while not ALL widgets, tilt the scale massively in favor of the visual, tricky, goofy, funny [insert more terms here] approach, in a self-proclaimed effort to entertain you into learning.<br /><br />There is a part of me that can grok that and applaud this, but when it comes down to brass tacks, it just doesn't work for me. And when I say \\"doesn't work,\\" I am not even considering the question of whether the content is reasonably complete (other reviewers have pointed out that things may get dropped or glided over in th is process, with confusing results for learners). No, I mean \\"doesn't work,\\" in the sense that I am not sure what to do with it. As an example, there are several \\"Code Magnet\\" sections in this book. The conceit is simple: mix and match these jumbled code fragments, as if they were \\"magnetic poetry\\" on a refrigerator, so that together they form a program that outputs the desired stuff.<br /><br />This is a cute, attractive idea that a majority of readers can probably relate to -- but what is one supposed to do with a paper page of \\"code magnets.\\" Is the reader supposed to tear the page out? type all the code in and mix it around? It doesn't appear to be in the downloadable code for the book ... OH, well it seems O'Reilly sells the code magnets, for $19.95 / set. Hmm.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't know that last fact until I started this review. I'm not trying to be awfully snarky here, but I think the whole thing would work better as an interactive CD-ROM. It's hard for the activities to reach out and grab you (crossword puzzles work okay, I guess, but their pedagogic value is pretty small) when they're confined to paper.<br /><br />In short, try this thing first.

0132350882|4.0|Although only halfway through the book, I can already say that it is a joy to read.  In particular because the author doesn't just state what makes clean code but because he also takes time to explain why.    Most of it makes a lot of sense and should lead to better maintainable code. In places I feel that the author takes it a bit to the extreme but exaggeration never hurt anybody.    Definitely worth the price-tag.
031606792X|5.0|Caution, Highly addicting. I just loved the whole twilight saga and i think it is a must read. Can't wait for the movie to come out!
B001DDBCUK|5.0|The DVD came in the order I expected it to.  I was very satisfied with my purchase and pleased to get it for a price that was well below what I had seen in retail stores.
B0002V7O3I|3.0|Remembering this movie is from the mid eighties, you'll be quite impressed with the special effects, and the lighthearted story is entertaining. I got a real kick out of the terrible alien creatures but it was sad to see the acting talent of a very young River Phoenix and know it would be cut short. All in all, not the amazing movie you might remember if you haven't watched it since you were a kid - but definitely worth watching if you've got kids of your own or if you like to reminisce.
B0013FNC38|5.0|this cd is soulful, classy, fresh and up-to-date! definitely a good buy if you love rhythm and a little soul
B0018S6YO4|4.0|The Cd is worth purchase if you are a fan. The CD has several hits old and newer.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|This movie was everything that was enjoyable about watching an old-school Anime in live action.  The acting was exactly right, the shots, the effects.  The plot was great and they didn't waste time.<br />Don't believe the critics; this was a fantastically fun, exciting movie.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I saw this show on T.V. and had to have it. Shipping was fast ,product was in  perfect condition.
B0009H1CKG|5.0|I have given this dvd to at least a dozen friends and neighbors at Christmas. I have watched it at least 100 times. If your'e chilling with your favorite drink or whatever this concert takes you away from it all. I was stoked to see the bonus songs section was like another show. It is the 1st 5 songs before what is the main show and 1 song played at the end. The only thing that I didn't like is that Cosmic Slop wasn't played. That is my favorite song ever. Some others were not played either. I saw them first in Myrtle Beach then in Shreveport. I cant wait to see them again! I own the older concert as well and get funky to both. I strongly recommend this to everyone.
0375826726|5.0|What's terrible about this book?  Let's begin:  First, no matter what if they make a movie about it, it will be nowhere as awesome as this book.  Second, now i have to wait for near eternity for the fourth and final (maybe) book to come out.  Third, it makes me want to read the first two, which stinks 'cuz my girlfriend has them...  ... so terrible...
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Really enjoyed this Miniseries. Had a problem with disc #1, it stalled and wouldn't continue, but we kept at it and finally got it going again. Was realy surprised that thing really happened to John Adams, that I didn't know about. I then went out and got a copy of the book - and that's a real hard read.

0307346617|5.0|In WORLD WAR Z, I was prepared for a video-game-syle actioner mutated to the printed page, a perfect, quick thriller for the Halloween Season.<br /><br />I was NOT expecting the most well-crafted, original and affecting fiction I've come across in some years.<br /><br />Imagine a supernaturally-inclined Tom Clancy with a better ear for dialogue, a soul and an editor.<br /><br />Author Max Brooks plays the Zombie Game without breaking any rules, yet attacks the material from an utterly fresh angle.  The legions of undead (and they are LEGION; characters frequently describe \\"Zack swarms\\" extending seemingly to the horizon) lurch mainly through the background.  The focal point here is on the living and how they coped as their world faced an unrelenting apocalypse.<br /><br />Brooks' extensive research into international military might, zen philosophy, Asian pop culture, middle America, world current events and the psychology of terror creates a tale that bumps again and again into our bubble of everyday existence.<br /><br />This is a seriously scary read! Also: fantastically realistic, achingly sad and funny as hell...the hell that might be shambling up your street this very night.<br /><br />Cheers.

B0015KO52S|5.0|I just love this cd!  It's versatile, there is so much talent.  I have been a big fan of Jack White for a long time and this band is great! The first couple of songs rock and have some White Stripe type influence; I love the 3rd song, piano, harmony in the chorus-beatlesque.  There's some blues and country type influence-it is NOT a boring album! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B000UCEJEQ Songs of Mass Destruction]]  This album is great! I have recently discovered Annie Lennox and her past pursuits (the awesome Eurythmics), and am loving her newest album.  Annie's voice is something I could listen to for hours and never get tired of.  Her lyrics are deep and her songs are catchy without losing that soul which makes her music unique.  Her emotion shows in these songs, and for the better.  Go buy it, please!  Can't wait for the next album.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|This is in regards to the DVD 3-D version of Journey to the Center...    Being a huge fan of the older version, (with Pat Boone), I was very hesitant about this film. However, when I saw that it was in 3-D, I was sold.  Turned out all the lights, put the glasses on and waited to be thrilled.  Well...until now the only video that had truely 3-D effects that I had seen was, 'The Mask'. NOT the Jim Carrey film, but a much older movie about a young man obsessed with a tribal mask. The 3-D in that was very good, in that you could actually see a hand coming out of the screen at one point.  Back to 'Journey...' It is 3-D through-out and it is very good. It is not the kind that makes you think that something is coming at you. Nor does it have the ability to make things appear as if they are floating in space. (I have experienced that in the theaters).    I was surprised that the manufacturer did not include ANY instructions for adjusting your tv for optimal 3-D viewing.  Because of that, we were seeing double images throughout the film. Sometimes getting a bit annoying.  I tried adjusting the color, brightness and hue, but to no avail.    Overall I enjoyed the movie and think that it would be worth watching again.  I wish the 3-D effects had been better. With that said, I will still buy the 'Polar Express 3-D'.  BTW: the tv used for this was a Sony 32\\" HD.    The film may be a bit too intense for some children younger than 9 or 10. Most of it is alright for children. (Didn't hear ANY cussing). But, there are a couple of scenes toward the end that may be a bit harsh for some sensitive children. View it yourself first, then judge if it is appropriate for your children.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|One word covers it all, EXCELLENT! A must have for music lovers, this live recording is sweet. It's hard to believe that they put on such a fantastic show with only one chance to get it right. Highly recommended!!    Gene
B00008WT5M|2.0|This rating for this CD is within the context of comparing it to Back in Black, possibly the greatest hard rock album of all time. Let's face it, AC/DC set a standard so high with that album that even they haven't been able to match it since. Thunderstruck is by far the best song on Razors Edge--a great song, too--as good as most of the songs on Back in Black. And the title song, Razors Edge, is pretty good. But the rest, ehh--they don't quite cut it for me. I must say that when a band hones on one specific sound in one specific type of music with almost no variation in those areas (which I commend them for), the world's greatest songwriter will struggle with coming up with ALL KILLER SONGS on a dozen or so albums over the space of 20-25 years. AC/DC were truly inspired and full of magic when they wrote and recorded the Highway to Hell and Back in Black albums, but I think time has proven that those two efforts were their peak. I think it's great that they're still doing it, sticking to their guns music-wise and everything, but if you're expecting their more contemporary releases to rival Back In Black, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, including Razors Edge, unless you're not quite as picky as I am, which I admit I am....
B001DUKHXQ|5.0|No words can describe the thrill (get it? LOL) I felt when I first saw it, it's simply beautiful and at a bargain price.  Definitely a collectors item.   If you're a MJ fan then it's a must.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I have enjoyed many of the new BBC Jane Austen productions (Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility), so I had high hopes for Persuasion, my favorite Austen book. It started out well, and I rather liked the choice of a younger less weather beaten Captain Wentworth.  Yet by the end I was shaking my head and couldn't wait for it to end.  Sally Hawkins was a mopey Anne, who never did seem to get her bloom back.  And the scriptwriter--what happened?  Did he/she get drunk halfway through and decide to toss Austen's book?  Key bits of dialogue were shifted around, and then ending with Anne running a marathon around Bath was a disaster.  And the ending scene was a bit odd, too.  It's not as if Anne was longing for a house for eight years...    Luckily, we still have Amanda Root and the wonderful film from 1995.

B0002KVULG|5.0|I've read Bram Stoker's original novel and enjoy seeing different film versions of the Dracula story. I especially enjoy seeing different actors' take on the titular character. To properly review this 1979 version with Frank Langella allow me to briefly comment on the various Dracula films and actors in the starring role:<br /><br />Bela Lugosi in \\"Dracula\\" (1931 b&w): Lugosi has the quintessential Drac accent and is charismatic in the role, but the film itself is very dated and most modern viewers will find it boring and unappealing. The film is short at a mere 75 minutes, but I can never manage to get through it.<br /><br />Christopher Lee in the Hammer film series (1958-1973): Christopher is evil incarnate in the role; unfortunately he comes off one-dimensional and therefore a bit boring (he rarely ever speaks), not to mention he gets very little screen time in the grand scheme of things. The series has its share of good moments (\\"Tastes the Blood of Dracula\\"), bad (\\"The Satanic Rites of Dracula\\"), decent (\\"Horror of\\") and bizarre (\\"Dracula A.D. 1972\\").<br /><br />Jack Palance in \\"Dracula\\" (1973): This is a surprisingly effective made-for-tv version of the tale. Palance is sympathetic as a man in miserable bondage to vampirism. Quite good despite its tv-oriented limitations.<br /><br />Gary Oldman in Francis Ford Coppola's \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" (1992): This one is visually oppulent and captivating throughout the first half. Unfortunately Oldman is unmemorable in the titular role and is only effective as the old-man Dracula seen at the beginning. Later in the story he does a great imitation of John Lennon (lol). Despite its title the film is not truly faithful to its source. Dracula here is portrayed as a not-truly-bad victim of severe love-sickness rather than a paragon of unadulterated evil as portrayed by Stoker. Still, the first half is loaded with great scenes, including Drac's Brides' seduction of Harker and the subsequent horrifying baby sacrifice. The second half unfortunately loses the film's initial captivating appeal.<br /><br />Which brings us to Frank Langella's take on the character in this 1979 version. Langella plays Dracula as a gentleman with serious dark charm. Behind this facade lurks beastial evil, total arrogance and powerful supernatural abilities. The story shows that Dracula can seduce just about any woman with his hypnotic powers and dark charisma; he can also climb walls upside down and morph into a creature of the night at a whim. The story shows his weaknesses as well, which Van Helsing (Laurence Olivier) and his partner (Donald Pleasence) take advantage of.<br /><br />Another highlight is Kate Nelligan's effective portrayal of Lucy, whom Drac chooses as his vampire bride.<br /><br />In addition, more than any other Dracula film this one features the best dialogue bits, e.g. \\"Time is on my side. In a century when you are dust I will call and awaken Lucy my queen from her grave,\\" \\"You fools -- You think with your crosses and your waffers you can destroy me? I AM THE KING OF MY KIND,\\" etc. (The band Helstar utilized quotes from this film for their 1989 masterpiece NOSFERATU).<br /><br />The story completely omits the initial Transylvania sequence, opting to start with Drac's arrival in England on a mysterious shipwreck of dead men. Ordinarily I'd object to this since I love that creepy opening sequence, but it works here. The rest of the film plays loose with Stoker's novel, but all the necessary elements are here. This works for those who are bored with the basic Dracula tale and require fresh ideas to stay interested.<br /><br />PERSONAL RATING: A-cond half unfortunately loses the film's initial captivating appeal.<br /><br />Which brings us to Frank Langella's take on the character in this 1979 version.

0375826726|4.0|I've read the reviews bemoaning the introspective nature of this book and I respectfully disagree.  While the book is more thoughtful and let's us see how the war and decisions made during it are effecting the young men fighting it, it is far from boring and still advances the story.  You can the the maturation of Eragon and Roran, through the growth of this talented young writer.<br /><br />His imagery is still among the finest I'd read.  I can close my eyes and see the spirits and monsters they fight, the clothes and armor they wear and the expressions of the elves and dwarves.  I was entertained and awed by the imagination of the series and am very much looking forward to the final book in the Inheritance series.
B000031XBQ|4.0|In Latin America, ABBA has a legion of die-hard fans. We love their music and we don't need to hear the songs in our language, so these versions could be recorded for Spanish fans (I mean: from Spain) but their are talking and singing as Latin American. We accept ABBA's effort even with that strange pronunciation (we need to read the lyrics in Spanish to understand what are they singing!!!). Some lyrics sounds really strange in Spanish and have no sense (\\"Conociéndome, Conociéndote\\", \\"Ring Ring\\") but the good ones are really-really good. I think the best translation is \\"Al Andar\\" (\\"Move on\\"), so its music has a particular Latin American sound. Fernando sounds like a South American song too. All songs represent one of the most beautiful efforts to conquer our hearts and we take it like it is. Frida and Agnetha could make it bad or make it good, but we still love these versions. (By the way, here in Peru ABBA's music still sounds at the radio every day...).
B001F12J48|4.0|I'm speaking from the point of view that we all already know the movie/story itself (even without 3D) is wonderful. It has become a holiday treasure even for me, and I am a die-hard fan of the holiday specials from the 60's and 70's (with the one exception of \\"A Christmas Story\\" which came out in the 80's). That being said:    LET'S NOT EXPECT AN IMAX 3D EXPERIENCE HERE, PEOPLE!!! LOL    This DVD comes with 4 of those old-timey glasses that have blue on one eye and red on the other. The 3D effects are fair to middling to decent, definitely adding to the experience for me, and I'm just watching it on a small 13\\" laptop so far.     What is especially nice is you get the non-3D version (in widescreen) on a separate disk in this case, so if you don't already have it, you're getting two for the price of one.     I'm curious to see how other folks experience this product - perhaps on larger screens, flat screens, etc., the effects might be better.     I saw it last year at IMAX in 3D and there is just no way to duplicate that on a home system. Considering the comparatively crude electronics most people have, this 3D version is pretty good.    Please note that they include viewing tips which consists of recommendations that you watch this in a dark room (with no glare on screen) with your screen settings very bright in order to get best results.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|I saw this film within the first week that it was released back in 1974 in Toronto. At the time I was about 24, and saw it with a couple of friends. I knew the campus of U of T where it was filmed, so it made the whole thing more realistic. I can't remember EVER being so scared by a film since. Two of my daughters saw it and refuse to ever watch it again. They were horrified. Anyway, if you like horror films, I hope you see it at least once and enjoy. Every time I hear the phone ringing while I'm home alone, I think of the sorority house. Every time I look at an attic door....
B001DU8T6S|4.0|This is a solid album which I think would be worthwhile to most queen fans.  Imagine taking the Brian May penned queen tracks and getting Paul Rogers to sing them rather than Freddie and Brian.  This is mixed with the more bluesy rock of Paul Rogers.  Brian or Roger mainly do backing vocals making it sound like queen of old, and at times Paul Rogers sounds strangely like Brian.    The album concentrates on the rock side with some folksy stuff, and a few nice ballads.  The album seems more cohesive than Brian's solo albums but I would say lacks a strong single or two - which his ones did have.  The guitaring is gorgeous as always.    If you liked Brian's solo albums, or Paul Roger's you'll like this guarunteed.  It sounds more like queen than any other band, but if you're a die hard freddie fan it may not be for you.  It isn't camp and over the top, the songs are less complex and dynamic, and the vocals lack the force freddie had - not to say that they are bad.  Also the lyrics can be pretty cringe worthy at times.  It is not an album that will top the charts nor will it find many new fans, but it is definately worthwhile having if you like queen, classic rock and beautiful leads.
B001DHXT20|5.0|Being a fan of the Bill Bixby series, I loved this movie and it's references to that TV series. The best part about the movie is that you can tell this Hulk is angry. I actually got scared at some parts because this Hulk is out for blood and that is the way it should be. Ferrigno finally got to talk for the Hulk in a movie (not including the cartoon series). I loved it and thought it is very well done and I hope they make a sequel. Sadly, the last time I heard, they weren't going to :(
0385504209|5.0|I haven't read this book in a long time, but I feel obligated to write a review due to the vast amount of controversy over it.<br /><br />First, let me just tell you my impressions of the book.  I found it riveting to read.  It is definitely a page-turner which keeps you hooked until the very end.  The chapters are short and there are lots of flashbacks interspersed throughout the book.  Everything is a puzzle and Brown gives you all sorts of clues, but somehow the answer is always just out of reach.  The book has a great amount of suspense and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a terrific thriller / mystery.<br /><br />For some reason, the book being a riveting page-turner is not enough for some people.  Even though this book is clearly a work of fiction, we have all sorts of religious zealots and determined critics who must chime in with their two cents worth.  The bible thumpers will say all sorts of hocus pocus related to the book and its content.  Critics determined to show you how smart they are will denounce the book and say its full of historical inaccuracies.<br /><br />I'm not sure why people are going so crazy over this book.  Let me spell it out for everybody:  This book is a work of FICTION.  Period.  Works of fiction are meant to entertain the masses.  If you are interested in historical facts pertaining to religion, read a different book.  If you want a book that will enthrall you until the very end, look no further.
0141311398|4.0|Adult readers, please shut off your reality and turn on your imagination; please read Roald Dahl's THE WITCHES. It's written for 7-12 year olds, but I guarantee you'll also have fun with it.     My favorite lines pinched my nostrils together when I read them. \\"I ... ran into The Grand High Witch's bedroom. There was the same musty smell about the place that I had noticed in the Ballroom [a witches' meeting]. It was the stench of witches. It reminded me of the smell inside the men's public lavatory at our local railway-station.\\"     Pee-ew! That's some stench!

0439023483|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, and can't wait until next fall when book 2 is released. It provokes a lot of thought on the government in the book, and I am curious to see how Katniss plans to fight in the future. I do have theories as well on the possibilities of the relationship between Kat and Peta... can't wait to see how they measure up. In short, Suzanne, hurry up and get book 2 out!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am not a gym rat.  In fact, I hate having to lock myself inside a building of unfamiliarity and/or \\"sharing\\" of equipment.  After having my first baby 7 months ago I have been looking for something that is short in time (do during baby nap) but intense enough that I'm \\"feeling\\" it work.  This DVD hits it on the nail.  Some reviewers stated it's for the more experienced and I couldn't agree LESS!  I haven't been to a \\"gym\\" or work out class in over year because of complications and Jillian offers alternative positions and even admits in the workout that if we (at home) need to take a break do but not more than 5 seconds...that's just enough to catch my breath and continue with the work out.  It's as if she were in my living room because as soon as I hit the point of \\"oh my, I'm going to die, I cannot go on!\\" she says somethign to the fact that if you're feeling that way that means it's working so keep it up!  I love that, it feels one on one...and that was only Level one.  The fact that I can use this to build myself back up to a more experienced exerciser all in one DVD instead of having to buy three is wonderful!!  I highly recommend this to anyone trying to \\"get back into the swing of things\\"
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I remember being scared to death of this film when I was younger, but I of course grew to love it.  Jaws is one of my favorite all time movies, and this special edition DVD was certainly a blessing.  I recommend to all who have not seen it to check it out.

B001FW2R5I|5.0|I have been a Keane fan since the early days. I have everything they released and I could buy. I never understood the comparison to Coldplay. Is it solely because the two bands love keyboards? So did later Van Halen and neither British import sounds like the 80s rockers. Is it because both are British? So is Amy Winehouse, and neither band shares much in common with her except the accent - and the ability to innovate innovatively (i.e., unlike most others.)    Coldplay's orchestration and lyrics - and their artistic sensibilities - differ quite significantly from Keane's, except that both bands are children of the 80s - the U2, Fixx 80s, not the Debbie Gibson 80s, and as such, both infuse their music with a bit of darkness, edginess, desperation.     I love Coldplay, let's be clear. This isn't a \\"which Brit band is better?\\" This is about a solid, sensitive, searching band being misunderstood and dismissed too quickly by us all-too-knowing, too-influenced-by-radio listeners on this side of the Pond. (And let's be clear. I love America.)    So, Perfect Symmetry. Tom Chaplin's voice is clear and more nimble than ever. Tom can wrap his vocal chords around a note and nail it then sustain it, caress it, love it. (Could be catty here and ask if Chris Martin could do so? No, his signature, like Sheryl Crow is to miss the note so compellingly you have to listen to the genius lyrics - it made Bob Dylan a mint, so why not? And all three are gifted songwriters and musicians.) He stretches without sounding stretched or strained, he yearns and gasps for breath and you yearn and gasp along with him.    The band has tried to shake things up without shaking away what makes Keane special - the distorted sounds that sound normal after a few spins of the CD, the slightly off-kilter beats that keep the song in line. This is, perhaps, their most political album, though these are not the typical politics of Left v Right. They are the politics of people understanding people, people in conflict, in chaos, in fear. In this sense, Keane is like Coldplay, whose Viva La Vida also is a searing commentary on the current state of affairs. It's not mimicry, but rather symptom of the times, much like the music of U2, the Fixx, Depeche Mode and other bands of the 81-85 era. How can a band not be influenced by the fear and chaos around them?    The album opens with this jarring, dissonant yet musical whoop - Ooooh! We're spiralling down. It contrasts sharply with the pure musicality of Tom's voice, which is the point, and even Tom's voice is a bit distorted, processed, which, again is the point. Tim Rice-Oxley has a brilliant ear - he hears what none of us hear until he plays it for us and we nod our heads and say, \\"Ah, yes! Tinny sound, full sound, edgy sound...play it again!\\" And drummer Richard Hughes is no less creative and restless, creating a beat, beat, beat-up backdrop without which we cannot do.     Spiralling is edgy, the edgiest I've ever heard Tom's voice. There's an impatience, an anger, an irony. \\"I know you people,\\" he seems to be saying, and Tim's keyboards echo, \\"Yeah! I know you posers,\\" and Richard's drums pound like a fist in your face. But who is posing - them or us?    Talk about political, angry, sad and warning. That's the song around which the album is built: Perfect Symmetry. Listen to it. Again. Again. Who is and isn't implicated? This is and should be an anthem for this time. Why it isn't, I don't understand, and that's why I am not a record company exec.     My favorite tracks are Spiralling, The Lovers are Losing, Perfect Symmetry, Again and Again, Playing Along.    Do I miss the heartwrenching songs like Bedshaped, She Has No Time? Yes, I do. But I also recognize that now is a time for being pushed, for being questioned, for being energized and enraged, and it is a time of deep, wonderful musical exploration.     I highly recommend this CD. It isn't perfect, but then again, are any of us? Do any of us produce perfect work? Might wefind lessons and inspiration in the fragile imperfect world in which we live? Keane says yes. Oh, and the bonus DVD is interesting. Not as deep as the DVD for Under the Iron Sea, but if you like or love Keane, what's to lose? Love Richard's dog costume!

0446677450|1.0|How do you become rich? Simple. Just write a book about how to become rich. I've see the author's face everywhere, and he unfortunately is a bit of an opportunist. Aside, from the self-aggrandization, his advice is just wrong, and even worse, it's harmful to the ill-informed. This book focuses on what people supposedly do wrong with their finances, but provides very little help for how to do things right, or more important, how to become \\"rich\\".     So what's \\"wrong\\"? Investing in a 401-K is wrong, he says. Saving cash in a savings account is wrong. His reasoning is that a 401-K locks in your money and a savings account stagnates. True, but at least you're saving something, as opposed to what he considers \\"right.\\"    And what's \\"right\\"? Investing in the stock market is right. And buying real estate is right. Owning your own business is right. You need only glance at the past month's headlines to realize that this is really, really bad advice. High home foreclosures. The sharpest drop in the stock market ever. And businesses laying off record-numbers of employees and many shutting their doors.    Rich Dad, Poor Dad encourages everyone to be an entrepreneur, but neglects to mention the dramatic pitfalls that come along with it. Not everyone is an entrepreneur, nor should most people try to be. If you are supporting a family, you ideally try to minimize risk, not maximize it.     The premise of this book is intriguing--that a shift away from the financial beliefs you were raised with could precipitate wealth--but the book not only fails to provide sensible ideas, it actually teaches very damaging ones.
031606792X|2.0|I read the first 3 books in 2 weeks and loved them despite their minor faults.  However, Breaking Dawn was difficult for me to finish.  Bella was needy and dependent during the last 2 books, but now she's obnoxious.  Stephanie Meyer wrote everything like this was a movie, complete with a hollywood ending.  This book is broken up into 3 parts (Bella's wedding, Jacob, than Bella again).  Some have complained that the Jacob perspective slowed down the book, but I found it to be the only readable part of the book.  I had to force myself to finish this book, which is sad since I enjoyed the others so much.

B001F2W4Y2|4.0|Well, it's been a long time since any, new AC/DC material has come out, but it's finally here. \\"Black Ice\\" contains 15 more hard-rockers at over 55 minutes, with such heavy anthems like \\"Rock 'n' Roll Train\\", \\"Spoiling For A Fight\\" and \\"Wheels\\". Obviously, all the songs are, at minimum, solid and worthy AC/DC songs.  Now as a longtime fan, I realize what AC/DC will and won't do. They're never gonna write a ten-minute epic with seven different sections. They're never gonna feature 1970's styled synthesizers in the background. Heck, they're probably never gonna have anybody guest on their albums.    And for their style of music, there's nothing wrong with that. They're all about rocking out, and cranking out that \\"simple but addictive\\" style of theirs with lots of great songs. But with all the albums they've done, by now they're kinda pushing the envelope on how far they can go with that style. Plus, Phil Rudd plays absolutely no drum fills, and the only time you can hear Cliff Williams' bass guitar, he's doing the same eighth-note bounce. C'mon guys, you've been playing the same song for over 25 years now, you rock and all, but surprise us!  Fortunately, little nuances like the slide guitar in \\"Stormy Mayday\\", Brian's soul-influenced singing and the semi-Celtic jig in \\"Anything Goes\\", or the title track's cross between an Aerosmith crunch and a Red Hot Chili Peppers groove does flavor up the album, taking it from good to great.  So what's the final verdict? Well at this point, I can safely say AC/DC is never gonna pull a big surprise outta their hat, BUT I will say that this album is really awesome, one of their best in a while. So head down to Wal-Mart with an Andrew Jackson in your wallet, turn the system up in your car, and prepare for some classic AC/DC tunes! Thanks for the time, and peace.

0345495004|5.0|I knew very little about Frank Lloyd's life so I found this very interesting.  The book was chosen by my book club and it was a great book for discussion since there were several issues, including women's rights, to talk about.  I would highly recommend reading this book.  The author had a very engaging style and kept the book moving.
015206396X|5.0|Any time I begin reading a fantasy novel, I'm strangely cautious in the beginning.  Perhaps it's because I've read far too many books that were a complete and utter waste of my time, some being fantasy or sci-fi as it takes far longer for a reader to understand the world that the author has created.  However, Cashore handles this world easily - without thrusting too many details on the reader causing you to feel overwhelmed.<br /><br />I'll admit that I did not fall in-love immediately with the novel, I wasn't sure about it for at least the first 50 or so pages.  But, eventually Graceling won me over.  I loved the characters, especially Po who I think has the greatest struggles to overcome in the book.  I liked the evolution of the characters and felt that Cashore developed them well, though it seems as though a sequel is basically a certainty.  I can only hope that Cashore decides to dwell on Bitterblue, who's continuing story seems to be extremely interesting.<br /><br />A particular thing that I felt were disruptive to the flow of the novel was the abruptness of the ending.  Loose ends were technically taken care of, but there was no great climax.  The height of the novel, the part that should be the most suspenseful, is handled in a matter of seconds and everything is fine again.  But even that couldn't make me lower my rating to 4-stars.  I truly loved this book and recommend it to readers that love a mix of fantasy, adventure, romance and a strong female lead.
0060512806|5.0|AM I GOING TO READ A THOUSAND PAGES BY ANYONE BUT TOLSTOI? NO. BUT I AM WRONG. HAVE NOT EVEN FINISHED THIS AND CANNOT WAIT TO TELL YOU TO READ THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE NATURE OF HACKING AND COMPUTATION, IN WW2, IN EVIL, IN REAL SEXY FUN, IN THE WORLD AMERICA HAS CREATED, IN THE PHILIPPINES -- I HAVE NEVER READ ABOUT THE P. IN ANY OTHER NOVEL.  SURE PARTS ARE BORING BUT DON'T SKIP.  DO NOT MAKE BELIEVE YOU UNDERSTAND. REREAD AND YOU WILL LEARN SOMETHING.  SOMETIMES ITS NOT A NOVEL BUT A LONG AND VERY INTERESTING REPORT.  SOMETIMES ITS A TEN PAGE SHAGGY DOG STORY.  IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN TV AND EVEN NETFLIX AND YOU KNOW WHAT -- ITS ABOUT THE WORLD WE ACTUALLY LIVE IN AND CANNOT LEARN ABOUT FROM JOURNALISM, YOUR PARENTS, MOST OF YOUR TEACHERS.  THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK WITHOUT EVER GOING OVER THE TOP -- EVEN WHEN HE IS METICULOUSLY DESCRIBING MASS MURDER.  WHICH IS FAIRLY OFTEN. AND WHEN HE DESCRIBES THE INTERIOR OF WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COMMIT MASS MURDER BUT ARE PREVENTED FROM DOING IT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT EVIL -- HE IS EVEN BETTER.  AND REMEMBER, WE LIVE IN A WORLD THAT WAS CREATED BY MASS MURDER AND ITS STILL ON THE WORLD'S AGENDA.  IF N.S. IS A NERD, I HAVE A NEW FOUND RESPECT FOR THEM.
0439023483|5.0|All I can say is: WOW.  The Hunger Games is an absolute fantastic novel.  I can't hardly put it into words how amazing this book is.  I first became aware of it, actually, from Stephenie Meyer who mentioned the book on her website (yes, I do occasionally check out Meyer's website!) and was immediately intrigued by the premise.  The plot reminded me a little bit of The Lottery, but adapted superbly.  This type, though its characterized as being for Young Adults and features a lead of 16 years old is written for ANYONE.  If you're someone who, for whatever reason, tends to avoid YA fiction, thinking that it's too simplistic (I'll admit, I once thought that), you can put your mind at ease with this novel.  I basically camped out on my couch and was unable to move until I finished it.  All right, I suppose that's enough gushing for now.  I'll add just one more thing directly to Ms Collins: There better be a sequel.
0312330529|5.0|I loved the detailed feel of this book - it felt really authentic. I loved the character of Prabakar - he really made the book for me.  I could hear his voice and see his head waggle as he talked.    Really an amazing story.  I kept flipping to the back cover to read that this was based on his true experiences.  It's really unbelievable at times!  Enjoyable read.

B001F2W4Y2|3.0|AC/DC has become a corporate monster, no doubt about that. About this new studio album after eight years, here follow my humble comments:<br /><br />1) THE PROS:<br /><br />a) Brian Johnson - I don't know if it was voice coaching, medical treatment or studio wizardry: his voice is much better than in previous album. At least now I can listen to all songs in a row without wishing to blow my head off. That's how bad his voice was.<br /><br />b) Production values - everything is crystal clear, all instruments are powerful, bright and right on the spot. Even Cliff Williams' bass can be heard. Brendan O'Brien and Mike Fraser did a master job producing this album.<br /><br />c) General quality of the songs - it's hard to make 15 good songs in a row. However, contraty to to previous albums, there's not one filler here. Even if you don't like one particular song, you won't get the feeling it's a throaway song.<br /><br />2) THE CONS<br /><br />a) The \\"Wal-Mart only\\" distribution - annoying, obnoxious, ridiculous. Better prove that they are corporate monsters there isn't.<br /><br />b) Phil Rudd's immersion into total mediocrity - his drums sound is great here and we all know that, in AC/DC, his job is to keep things steady, no rolls at all. But it's hard to listen to 55 minutes of 4/4 music without ONE SINGLE dynamic or adventurous drum roll! He's more restricted than 30 years before! Even Charlie Watts is better than he now!<br /><br />c) Lack of lyrics - even in 2008, the band releases an album without lyrics... Ok, AC/DC lyrics in the Brian Johnson era (including after the Young brothers assumed lyrics) are close to utter inutility, but, even so, they should have included them.<br /><br />3) GENERAL CONCLUSION:<br /><br />It's a worth purchase to your AC/DC collection.
1416575464|4.0|I was unhappy my hubby picked this book, aT FIRST. Then I opened it and instantly got a GREAT idea from the book. Well that got me going through the whole book and I just loved the variety of ideas from classic to bohemian to<br />earthy et al.<br />I also loved the small space solutions, decorating tricks and what is called the domino effect which starts w/ an idea and builds one piece upon another to get a desired finished project.<br />Being a person who starts reading wherever I open a book up, I eventually got to the Getting Started portion , in the FIRST PAGES of the book!!Who could have known?? =+ )<br />Very helpful and very practical in giving you proper direction...less mistakes....keep you on budget...really learn how to decorate/remodel in the future and more.<br />I usually am left cold by this type of book as I already have my own ideas<br />but this I really liked and so did my husband who is quite talented in<br />renovating etc.And, also , has his own ideas.<br />These writers had MORE ideas, most all inexpensive and all creative and we liked that a lot<br />You also get a free subscription to domino magazine w/ purchase.It's in a postcard in back of book.<br />VERY NICE !!!
B001E1GXPA|5.0|I'm speechless - I had the opportunity to meet these guys in Corpus Christi - and they're awesome - down to earth and fun guys. I can honestly say that the music they have created in shogun will blow you away - the riffs, solos, choruses - everything has been put together perfectly...It's by far Trivium's best sounding album ever - it's an in your face sound that simply makes you tap your foot or bang your head. Into the mouth of hell we march with Trivium and their masterpiece - Shogun.     Matt - Corey - Travis - Paolo = the best musicianship ever!

0618918248|2.0|Dawkins is clearly a gifted writer, but the topic he tackles is at times over his head.    For example, he does an extremely poor job dealing with the problem of irreducibly complex survival features in organisms.    In his discussion on this subject he repeatedly points to the dichotomy of chance vs. natural selection, seemingly never realizing that irreducibly complex features present just as much (or more, really) of a difficulty for theories espousing the latter.    Contrary to his assertion, if something is irreducibly complex it could NOT have simply aggegrated by small degrees over time.  There would be no selection for the component parts because only the whole is relevant to the organism's survival.  In this case, chance is actually a BETTER explanation than natural selection, for the latter is not an explanation at all nor even internally coherent.    Anyway the book is clever, funny, and enjoyable.  Not terribly scientific, but it's a tough subject, obviously.
1932100660|5.0|I am so thankful that this book fell into my hands. As someone who loves learning about nutrition, I realize now that I have been assuming that the information we receive from the media is true and in our best interests. I find that when I try to talk to people about Dr. Campbell's alternative view to nutrition, they become highly defensive, even angry. We don't want to hear that what we have been taught for so long could possibly be wrong! Here in northern Europe, where we consume lots of dairy and meat products, we are increasingly suffering from cancers and heart disease. Many consider the Scandinavians to be the epitome of health, but I think this can only be credited to our highly active lifestyles.    If you dare to have an open mind to this book and use your own common sense, I think you will gain a fascinating perspective even if you choose not to make the changes recommended.
B000A88EVE|5.0|This is a very strange movie, but it's cool at the same time. It's not for childen. and i wouldn't want it to be. I don't care how old it is, but, i think the weirder it is the better. They could make it a little more weird though, make it more scary.    I love  David Bowie's music.
0446579939|4.0|I loved this book. It may not have been my favorite Nicholas Spark's book but it is close!
031606792X|4.0|Before I even read this book, I read the reviews for it.  I was shocked how everyone ripped it to shreds.  Of course in those reviews were spoilers, spoilers that I couldn't believe.  I kept thinking do I really want to read this book now!  I loved Edward and the Cullen's. Bella irritated me a lot, but I still loved her with Edward. Jacob was never my favorite character, but he was needed to balance out the stories.  I didn't want to read this book and ruin my whole view of these characters I've learned to love and hate all at the same time.  I'd already bought the book though so I sucked it up and started reading...I couldn't put it down.  I kept thinking who ever wrote those reviews obviously didn't read the book very carefully.  I absolutely loved this book, and I'm glad I didn't listen to those reviewers.  Sure there were flaws, but even book 7 of Harry Potter had flaws!    I decided to talk to some of my friends who were still reading or just finished the book.  I asked what they thought, and all of them really loved the book also.  I was curious by this and went back online to find more reviews on the book and came to a conclusion...you either love this book or you hate. There is no gray area inbetween. So my advise to anyone who wants to read this book and are unsure...read it and form your own opinion. Don't listen to any of the reviews good or bad.
1568987846|5.0|Full disclosure: this is a book by a friend. But that said, I honestly find it lovely. I'm a book in hand person, not ready yet to go only for screen images so I was glad this book (based on a popular web site) was created. I received my copy during a difficult time and I found great comfort and distraction in the peaceful images. Both photographers have a fresh outlook and wonderful hand at simplicity and nuance. I got ideas about room decoration, hand made crafts while at the same time basic reminders of the cycles of life. This is a book I will return to for quiet times and times when I need creative inspiration. My only wish was that the book was a larger format.

B000H1RFKA|5.0|I have been a fan of this film for a few years and was happy to learn that it was available for Blu-Ray. The film was clear and the picture was vibrant so if you have this film for DVD you may want to upgrade. The film is well worth it; it's dark humor is brilliant and I hope Robert Downy Jr. and Val Kilmer make more movies together.
B000NTPDSW|3.0|The Blue-Ray version of I leaves much to be desired.  Dark scenes are REALLY dark and lack detail.  Colors lean toward an annoying yellow-orange tint.  II is a bit better but not much.  III is the best visually.  Given that many films from the same period as I and II look beautiful, I find this puzzling.  Coppola's real-time discussion of the first movie is fascinating in portraying yet another studio that was too stupid for its own good and nearly screwed up one of the greatest films of all time.  Godfather I is a fabulous film, if disquieting in its subject matter, but I wish Coppola would have incorporated the deleted scenes he included on a television version.  I was less enamored of II, which didn't know if it wanted to be a prequel or a sequel, so it did both and suffered for it.  I would have preferred a full prequel and made GFIII as the sequel.  Its higher operational budget is apparent, but the film is less satisfying.  Much more complex than Godfather I, I was often unable to discern the good bad guys from the bad bad guys.  Many have bashed III unmercifully, but I am not one of them.  It is the most disquieting of the three given its involving the Catholic Church and incorporating real events.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|The DVD plays beautifully, no glitches. you are able to see the entire movie and it is such a cute movie.
B001ESYAJY|5.0|Great music has always been an integral part of the James Bond franchise. The Monty Norman \\"James Bond Theme\\" has been interwoven through each of the 20 Bond films preceding \\"Casino Royale.\\" Through the decades it was altered, changed, synthesized, and then returned to its more original form more times than can be counted.    After the 1987 Dalton film \\"The Living Daylights,\\" a problem sprang up for Bond's people: John Barry, the primary musical driving force of the franchise, left the scene. Barry's score for \\"The Living Daylights\\" was one of the finest additions to the Bond franchise up to that time. The 1989 score for \\"Licence to Kill,\\" on the other hand, may take the cake as the worst Bond score ever (its competition being, without question, Marvin Hamlisch's score for \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\"). Even 1995's \\"Goldeneye\\" score was not terrific. With the 1997 Bond-debut of David Arnold for \\"Tomorrow Never Dies,\\" however, things pulled a 180. Arnold re-invigorated the Bond music, returning it to its roots in 1997, and quickly adding his own dramatic flair with the 1999 and 2002 films.    With the re-launch of the series in \\"Casino Royale\\" and \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" however, we are seeing Bond re-born. The scores for these films portray that \\"newness\\" with a sparse showing of the Bond theme - this is not the same spy who had fought the Soviets during the Cold War, but an all-new man of the 21st Century. This score, then, is a perfect fit for the new film. It shows Arnold's orchestral flair and flourish, as well as his adaptive abilities in exploring new musical concepts. There are some wonderful throwbacks to the piano-theme for Vesper from \\"Casino Royale,\\" reminding us of the driving force behind this film's plot, as well. When the Bond theme does put in an appearance, it is fresh, refined, and interesting.    I fully expect that the finished movie, when released, will most likely have more raucous \\"Bond theme\\" moments (the trailer, for example, had a high-energy and all-new guitar version of it), but the CD release is a wonderful standalone. If you're expecting to hear the Bond theme every five seconds, you might perhaps be disappointed, but considering the context of the two latest films, the balance of this score seems to be terrific!

The polish language is a bit harsh compared to Pat's kind of south american sounds on the originals. She sings great and if you are a fan of vocals this will be a addition to the collection. Metheny hardcore fans might find something missing.

To visually impress me its not all about having the biggest and most expensive stage. Moreso it is how the stage and lighting are used. I highly recommend you youtube \\"Coldplay Politik Live 2003 DVD\\" and you will see how effective the lighting show complements the music.

B000VSBX34|2.0|I am a Beatles Fan & enjoy listening to their music. However, this being said, I thought the movie, \\"Help!\\" wasn't very good. It was a combination music video of the  The Beatles performing their various songs in different locations and a movie about a group of evil religious zealots trying to steal one of Ringo's rings.    \\"Help!\\" is a really artsy film, where we see crazy, unrealistic antics happening repeatedly by all the cast members. The acting is bad in this film and the storyline is silly throughout. The music, costuming & make-up are the only redeeming features in this film.
B001BKG9RQ|3.0|I don't own \\"On an Island\\" so I can't compare the live versions to the studio.  However, now I don't feel like I need to buy \\"On an Island\\" because of this CD.  None of the reviews seen to indicate that they're all that different.    For the non-\\"On an Island\\" tracks, my comments:  -Other solo material would be welcome, a track or two from both his self-titled album and \\"About Face.\\"  I realize that if he didn't play it live, it can't be on there, but there you go...  -Full version of \\"Echoes\\" is fun to hear.  I assumed it was an abbreviated version like was played at the first few shows of the \\"Momentary Lapse of Music\\" tour.    -Fat Old Sun, same; good to hear some more rare Floyd tracks.    -For the Floyd tracks, well played, great versions, but nothing all that new or radical.  I think most Floyd fans have several versions of all the songs on there, either done by Floyd, Gilmour, or Waters, and these are good, but don't really stand out all that much from the other versions.    It's a great CD, I really enjoy it, if you're on the fence if you should buy it or not, I would buy it.  You'll enjoy it, but just realize that its' not really anything you haven't heard before.

B00028HBKM|5.0|When this film came out, I chose not to see it.<br /><br />The reports about shocking violence, and about this movie being about not much more than it, persuaded me that this was just another case of Hollywood using violence to sell, as in this case sex would clearly not work.<br /><br />Besides, I wondered what Gibson could have added to what I already pretty well knew.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with the time I got accustomed to the idea of giving it a try, and last year I bought the DVD.<br /><br />It was then that I discovered how wrong I had been.<br /><br />This is a shocking, but powerful film. It made me, literally, cry like a child, but the message really hit home. No Gospel reading and no meditation had ever brought the reality, the brutal physicality of what happened in those twelve hours so vividly close to me.<br /><br />One reads about suffering, and violence, and humiliation, and builds a picture of it within himself which is forcibly limited to the experiences of violence and suffering that he could himself observe, or imagine.<br /><br />But this film is different. This is \\"being there\\". This is the violence of the nailing, or the unbearable brutality of the scourging, as vividly represented as I could never have imagined it myself, because of the lack of the most elementary experiential frame. Not even with my imagination had I been able to correctly understand the sheer atrocity of the events.<br />I discovered that I had been able to read about, to vaguely imagine, but not to really feel what does it mean to be scourged, or to be nailed to a cross.<br /><br />Therefore, the violence is not useless; on the contrary, it is an indispensable instrument to the true understanding of those events, the more so because our society is, thankfully, so far away from such levels of violence. It is not a Hollywood gimmick, but a learning instrument. It is not there to awaken your worst instincts, but your best ones.<br /><br />I cannot know, and it is difficult for me to judge, what effect this movie might have on a non-Christian, though I can well imagine that for some of them, this film might be life-changing.<br /><br />But I feel pretty sure that the impact on sincere believers will continue to be very powerful in the decades to come.stian, though I can well imagine that for some of them, this film might be life-changing.

I have read so many things on the internet stating that this movie is a cult classic and how great it is and scary and awsome. This movie was actually WORSE than the remake...how can ANYTHING be worse than an over acted Nicholas Cage movie??? I didn't think it was possible, but this movie made it happen. Save your money, and your time! Don't watch it!

This CD is basically her letting everything out from the break up/divorce. But no one can expect her to have an upbeat CD after something like that. She's a very open, honest and real person. The 'Funhouse' theme seems confusing, but if you listen to the lyrics of the song 'Funhouse,' she says, \\"This used to be a funhouse, now it's full of silly clowns...\\"    So What (5/5) - At first when I heard the song, not on the radio, I was like wow this is Pink? It was very different at first. But it was definitely a good choice for a single, considering where it stands. It kind of sets a bad example for the CD, people will think it's going to be more upbeat, but it's more of a single than other songs.    Sober (5/5) - I really like this song because I think it's her talking about how she thought she was an alcoholic for a while because the only way she could have fun was to drink or to just get drunk. In which I'm guessing it's also saying, she didn't feel like that while she was with Carey.    I Don't Believe You (5/5) - This is definitely one of my favorite songs. It's much slower than the others but there's something about it that I really really love.    One Foot Wrong (3/5) - I like this song, but it's not one that I can listen to a lot. It's not the beat, so I don't know what it is.    Please Don't Leave Me (5/5) - A serious topic, but more upbeat. I like the beat, and her in the background singing \\"dadadada\\"    Bad Influence (5/5) - Definitely, definitely one of my favorites. This is the first one I decided I loved. Breaks away from the break-up topic and let's loose. The chorus is very catchy and the lyrics are funny. One part reminds me of the Muse song 'Knights of Cydonia.'    Funhouse (5/5) - Again one of my favorites. It relates to her relationship, but it's more upbeat. This song is in response to why the album is called that.      Crystal Ball (5/5) - Also adds to the 'Funhouse' theme.    Mean (5/5) - In the beginning it sounded like it should be a Kid Rock song. So I was expecting to hear something like that, but it's not. It's just a nice ballad.    It's All Your Fault (5/5) - More upbeat song, yet still personal. I really like the quick beat then the piano playing. The verses are slower, but then the chorus gets faster. One of my favorites. And I think she uses auto-tune in it for like 10 seconds, which is different from her.    Ave Mary A (5/5) - Also a bit more upbeat and breaking apart from relationship topic. But a more serious topic still. Just the world in general.     \\"Broken hearts all around the spot   I can't help thinking that we lost the plot   Suicide bomber and a student shot   Tokyo I think we got a problem     But for that they have gotta pay   If that don't kill you then the side effects will   If we don't kill each other then the side effects will   Deep down I think we got a problem\\"    Says it all.    Glitter in the Air (5/5) - A nice and a bit sad ballad. I really like her songs using pianos for some reason.

1932100660|4.0|This book offers a lot of good information. I thought it was interesting to read about so much good information about eating plant-based foods. However, the book is very long and drawn out, and a lot of it is written in a very dry manner. I think it could have been tightened more, dropping probably 75 pages or so since so much of the information repeats itself. A shorter more focused read would have made it go down easier. I still think the info and mission are good, I just think it would have been a smoother read had it been shorter, less repetitive and written in a little more interesting manner, rather than cut and dry science writing. Good info though...
B001DHXT2A|4.0|The second installment in the jade giants big screen adventure is vastly different from Ang Lee's cerebral film \\"Hulk\\". Regardless, in \\"Incredible Hulk\\" there's an excellent cast & the Hulk deserves no less but unlike Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\", in this one everything moves way too fast deteriorating any real character or story development. But what lacks for character & story depth makes up for in it's action sequences as the special fx are really top notch here & as equally visceral as Transformers, 300, or Ghost Rider. The special features include deleted scenes, behind the scenes, & the creating of the film which are all essential but the digital copy of the film is rather useless.
0452289963|3.0|I bought this book because of the hype and found it quite difficult to read and get into. However, I did find these key points hidden in the text useful.<br /><br />- \\"Life will give you whatever experience is most helpful for the evolution of your consciousness. How do you know this is the experience you need? Because this is experience you are having at the moment.<br />The quote above leads into another favourite author of mine, Joe Vitale \\"Once you have learnt the lesson, you no longer need the experience.\\" If you want to move on from your current place, then learn your lesson first.<br /><br />- \\"Unease, restlessness, boredom, anxiety, dissatisfaction, are the result of unfulfilled wanting.\\" Happiness is contentment with what we have because there will always be more we want. Be grateful for what you have right now.<br /><br />- \\"Awareness is the greatest agent for change.\\" If you know the problem you want to fix, you can fix it. Be specific about what you want to change.<br /><br />- \\"Whatever you think people are withholding from you, give it to them first. Act as if you have it, and it will come.\\"<br /><br />- \\"There is not only growth, birth, success, good health, pleasure and winning. There is also loss, failure, sickness, old age, decay, pain and death. Disorder erupts into everyone's lives.\\" But these too are part of life, the shadow side we must also embrace and learn from. It would not be a fulness of life without them.<br /><br />I have not bought any more of his books though, as I didn't find this as inspiring as I expected.
B0014BECF8|4.0|This is a nice collection of George Michael's works over the years, including some of his more recent releases.  There didn't seem to be a lot of remixing in the remixes, but its nice to have a double CD with his works all in one place.  I've always thought George Michael to be very talented and these CDs are a testament to that talent.
0316776963|2.0|Sedaris describes vignettes from his life in this wry-humored self-deprecating autobiography.<br /><br />He and I do not share the same sense of humor, so though I did find some of his stories throughout the middle of the text quite funny (particularly the way he described learning French and moving to France), I found the beginning and end of the book tedious reading. Perhaps I didn't read it in the right frame of mind. If I had approached it as a collection of short stories instead of a continuing narrative, I might have enjoyed it better, and I am willing to take the blame for that oversight, though I didn't see any reference to this book as a collection of short stories in any reviews.<br /><br />In the beginning, Sedaris describes himself as a vapid and shallow child, and a pretentious and annoying art student. As a reader, I simply didn't care about him.<br /><br />If you can stick with this novel until chapter nine, when Sedaris moves to NYC, his humor kicks into gear and the book becomes very amusing through chapter twenty-three.<br /><br />After that, subsequent chapters about uncomfortable self-revelations and insomniac fantasies are at times both repulsive and tedious, and divorced from any of the previous text. But then Sedaris finishes with one of the funniest chapters of the whole lot which leaves the reader laughing, but does nothing to draw the whole book together in conclusion.<br /><br />Many people have loved this book, but I did not find it very appealing or satisfying.<br /><br />C.A.Wulff - author of [[ASIN:1419664360 Born Without a Tail]]
0375826726|3.0|I consider Brisingr to be the \\"bridge\\" book of the trilogies. (I do know it's three of four, which isn't a trilogy unless you're referring to Hitchhiker's Guide, which is five, but bear with me.) Basically the point of a bridge book is to get you from point A to C. B being the one that holds the information that bogs A and C down. In a big epic fight between the hero and the villain, you don't want the hero going off to get a magic sword. He should've gotten that in a previous book.<br /><br />Right, so that's the point of bridge books. As a bridge book, it was pretty good, but I can't fairly rate a bridge book high as it really didn't have its own story. It was part of a bigger plot, yes, but by itself it falls flat.<br /><br />If I had to highlight parts of it to come up with a synopsis, I'd say Eragon and Saphira continue to help the Varden fight Galbatorix and in doing so, Eragon is sent on a menial mission that will inevitably bring them closer to defeating Galbatorix. It also deals greatly with Eragon and Saphira gaining new power (sword and heart of hearts) in order to defeat Galbatorix and learning of his vast power. So like I said, it's important to the overall plot, but by itself it's nothing.<br /><br />The battles are interesting to say the least. Roran kicks butt with a giant hammer. We learn more about their world. It raises more questions that will probably get answered.<br /><br />Read it if you plan on reading Inheritance Cycle 4, but if not you can skip it, especially if you haven't bothered with Eragon or Eldest.<br /><br />This one is my least favorite of this series.

B000FVQLQQ|3.0|Since I was so determined to see this movie because I really wanted to see it when it was released but I never got around doing it... I figured I would make it up.<br /><br />First of all, amazing acting from Russel Crowe. I am impressed. He seems to have a very broad register of roles and he delivers. He plays a very complex and different character, but he does it quite convincingly. I do not know John Nash and I haven't read his biography of which this movie is based on; but if the person in the movie resembles the real John Nash, I think he would have liked to partake in our discussion about introvertion! (Originally wrote this in a forum where the question about introvertion was brought up)<br /><br />Jokes aside, first of all, I should start with saying I didn't consider the movie bad, but there were some parts I really wanted more elaborated to give it a higher score in my eyes. One of those is that we never really understood much of his friends etc, and how his schizofrenia was discovered. I also wanted more background detail of his life, and in frustration I even went to Wikipedia.<br /><br />Suffice to say, I felt I got to know John Nash very well but all the other characters were like sidedrags. I didn't really know their names and I didn't understand why they were there at all. Also while I realize the movie is primarily about John Nash the person, not John Nash the matematician, it focused more on his schizofrenia than his mathematical work. Now, I find schizofrenia a very interesting mental illness, and while it was one of the major driving forces to see this movie I also wanted to know more about his work! It is briefly mentioned he invented the Nash Equilibrium among other things, but we never get to know what it truly means. Once again, Wikipedia resolved the problem.<br /><br />I think the movie did well as a biography though, and I even saw two copies of the Swedish king and queen! ...I think. They looked very similar regardless.<br /><br />It was a touching movie, but it could have been a little deeper. I didn't even understand Charles was his \\"best friend\\" until Dr. Rose mentioned it. As previously mentioned as well, while not maybe plot holes, they were at least holes that could have been filled and fleshed out a little more. While I understand this could have caused the movie to run closer up to 3 hours, I don't see much of a problem if people can have Lord of the Rings and Star Wars marathons...a little deeper.

0385340567|2.0|First, I LOVE Lee Child's books.  This latest one, though, was a complete bust.  Only buy it if you are interested in the author's personal opinions regarding: Iraq; veterns; war profiteering; the current administration.  I guess every good writer is entitled to a \\"rant\\" book where the writing and plot are treated as irrelevant.  I hope this Mr. Child's first and last.

B001DTPZNY|4.0|Even after all these years Harrison Ford can still do a film of this type. This was still a really fun Indiana Jones film.<br /><br />This film seemed, to me, to be a bit lighter on the action than in the previous films. But it wasn't lacking in the amount of action if you see what I'm saying.<br /><br />The plot for this film is Indiana Jones must save an old friend from the clutches of the Soviets because he managed to find a Crystal Skull which could lead to the one who finds it to Akator, El Dorado, The City of Gold. Where everything in the world will be laid at his feet. In fact Jones meets the Soviets at the beginning of the movie, but he doesn't know their entire reason for being in America. Along the way he meets Shia LeBeouf's character, Mutt Williams, and a surprise lays in store for both of them.<br /><br />In South America they manage to find the skull and their friend. They even find William's mother, a former love of Indiana Jones. She turns out to tell Indy that Mutt isn't just her son, but his too.<br /><br />There are traps and tricks along the way, but those mostly seem to lie closer to the end of the movie. They're still pretty interesting, but a little low compared to the other movies. The very end was definately not what I expected. My boyfriend thought the ending was pretty stupid, but even he liked the film total.<br /><br />I think the first three were better, but this is still a really good sequel to them.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is on the run from the authorities after conducting an experiment to himself that made him into a green and powerful brute called The Hulk (Voiced by Lou Ferringo) as he hides himself in Brazil where he can find inner-peace with himself. While he searches for a cure to his condition, General Ross (William Hurt) has discovered where he is and tracks him down so he and his soldiers can take them alive to conduct experiments. As Banner returns back to the states, he is reunited with the love of his life Betty (Liv Tyler) and accidently releases his rage to become the Hulk on some soldiers with Betty as the only thing that can calm the creature down. KBG agent Emil Bronsky (Tim Roth) conducts an experiment on himself with the same gamma that made Banner the Hulk when he's angry as it later transforms him into a hideous monster called The Abomination who's powers matches the Hulk's as the green goliath is the only one that can stop it.<br /><br />Exciting and action-packed reboot of the 2003 Ang Lee film which wasn't too bad but left a bad taste to most people's mouths. Director Louis Leterrier and star Edward Norton has made a stand-alone movie that remains more true to the roots of both the comic books and the classic 70's TV show with Bill Bixby. The special effects are a vast improvement over the last one with the Hulk being more convincing and less cartoonish this time, the action is non-stop and the performances are just terrific including Norton as the tortured soul Bruce Banner. There's special appearences by Lou Ferrigno, Stan Lee and Robert Downy Jr as Tony Stark which leads up to a big Marvel event movie coming in 2011.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers the best quality picture and sound that is mindblowing like the film itself! the extras are outstanding like the U-Control mode where you can watch extras during the movie or after the movie. There's a BD-Chat where you can hook the internet to your Blu-Ray player to make your own commentary with other people on-line plus some great extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, alternate opening, Comic Book gallery, character files, picture in picture access where you can see interviews and behind the scenes footage during the movie, animated comic, four featurettes and digital copy with the Blu-Ray box-cover in limited edition 3-D.<br /><br />Nice to see Marvel getting back on track on film with this and \\"Iron Man\\" being examples.her people on-line plus some great extras like audio commentary, deleted scenes, alternate opening, Comic Book gallery, character files, picture in picture access where you can see interviews and behind the scenes footage during the movie, animated comic, four featurettes and digital copy with the Blu-Ray box-cover in limited edition 3-D.

B0012Q732O|3.0|This was definately interesting as far as a \\"caveman\\" movie is concerned. It doesn't focus at all on the life of a cave person like Quest for Fire or Clan of the Cave Bear, but instead focuses on a man from a mountain, mammoth hunting tribe going off on an adventure to rescue his love from a people who stole her, and others, to do with them who knows what.<br /><br />The cover is misleading because the interaction between him and the tiger was surprisingly little.<br /><br />The ending to the movie is what makes this into a fantasy over having any historical value. I never expected pyramids to be anywhere near. I was sort of wondering why the writer wanted to end it that way.<br /><br />The movie does have a good message. It's about finding out who you are, learing to face fears and determination can win out against adversity. Of course we've seen movies that have dealt with these themes before, and better, but this movie is a nice escape for an hour or two.

Having seen this movie a few times before, I was not forseeing any real surprises. As for the actual story and such, I knew what to expect. It was the clarity that surprised me. The little things in the background. The scenery. All gorgeous...Now, for my movie review......\\"It Rocks!!\\"
B0000028PL|4.0|I've got mixed feelings about this album because I felt it was forced. LC didn't have to appeal to the punk/aggression audience, with their original brand of music I think they touched a lot of different audiences successfully. This album has it's bright spots, but most of the creativity is covered by the darkness of the album's tone. You judge for yourself, I did, and I thought the album was alright.

B000002LEE|5.0|I dropped a lot of acid listening to this, traveling to and fro the beach with my peeps, this album playing in the car stereo.<br /><br />I recently listened to it sober and now realize why I gravitated towards it, and so often as a youth.<br /><br />It embodies the animalistic desire to free oneself from conformity, and the self, and the confines of the establishment.  This was alternative before it became mainstream, hackneyed.  Never before has a rock group been so adept, and never since.

0446579939|4.0|It was a little hard to get into this new book by Nicholas Sparks, however, once you understand how it flowed, it was wonderful.
0143039601|4.0|Stylistically and idealogically its Kerouac through and through. The idea of living a truly free life and one without boundaries truely provoked a lot of thought for me personally. It makes you want to be one of Ray and Japhy's friends; to go find a shack to live in and really exist in what may be the only best way to exist, free of material incarceration. I recommend this book to be read by young adults everywhere. Not all will be opened to a new way of thought and what really matters in this world but some will and it could possibly change their life for the better by not being wrapped around society's focus on material possession as symbols of achievement.

0439023483|5.0|I read this after I saw that Stephenie Meyer has recommended it. (I'm a Twilight fan...) And I couldn't have been more pleased. It gave me the same kind of feel as Brave New World or 1984, but a teenage version. Though, it's not just a book for teenagers. In fact, I wouldn't give it to a kid under 13 or 14. Quite gory, but keeps you on the edge of your seat. I definitely didn't know it was going to be a part of a series, so the last page kind of made me freak out a little bit, but I'm ready for the next book!!

B001GAOY5U|4.0|...I picked this one up on an impulse, for the 3-D, and I'll admitt I was not disappointed. First of all, the 3-D, although is the traditional blue and red glasses and not shutter glasses or anything else works pretty well. I was amazed at how good the 3-D effects looked for your standard 3D glasses. The story is interesting enough to keep you watching. I would recommend the movie for its 3D effect, and it makes a good watch.
B0011NVC9I|5.0|If you look at this movie closley you'll see that it is animated. when i saw the previews i didn't know it was animated. they did a pretty good job making the actors look real. this was a very good movie. good action and animation.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|Basically, Brandon Fraser's getting kicked out of his college lab (SNL's Seth Meyers makes a great appearance), Brandon's nephew spends vacation with him before moving to Ottawa (I prefer Toronto), the two go volcano hunting in Iceland (none of my uncles would have ever spent the money to take me to Iceland)... Ahhh who cares, it's all just an excuse to for some 3D action! But let me warn you, DO NOT GET THIS IN STANDARD DEFINITION! Why?<br /><br />Because this movie looks stunningly beautiful in awesome in Blu-Ray, and it just adds so much to the experience. In SD, it's a sub-par experience, because the movie was made for HD, and of course 3D, but with those paper red/blue 3D glasses, I only noticed a substantial 3D effect during the credits. During the movie, the action just moves too fast, and your color is all distorted. So unless you have a really good pair of glasses, you might want to skip that. But you'll still have the picture and the action. It's a throwback to those Saturday matinee serials where things jump out, scare you, and surprise you. Things blow up, explode, collapse, and the action and adventure is certainly entertaining. Good family fun, although the little ones may find some of it a bit too intense.<br /><br />Overall, don't even consider the SD version as you'll only come out disappointed. HD on the other hand makes all the difference, and it makes the movie that much better. Sure the plot is nothing to write home about, but the family and I had a very fun time with this popcorn flick. And I'm very open to a sequel, if it's filmed in the same manner. An Atlantis plot is especially intriguing.<br /><br />Real Score: 4.5

B0013BNY2Q|4.0|Hailed even pre-release as a return to R.E.M.'s roots, and the press laid so much credence in this thought - it would kind of be hard to live up to.<br /><br />The result - they do and they don't.<br /><br />Is 'Accelerate' the new 'Fables of the Reconstruction'?  No.  But I didn't expect it to be.  But on the upside, it's also not one of their last two or three releases either.  While those were not horrid, they were just there and not horribly well thought out.<br /><br />I enjoyed 'Accelerate' - more than any disk since 'Automatic for the People' - but that is not to compare those two disks.  The new release has much much much more guitar - much more of a core band feel.  It is a welcome retro feel, but it is not 1980 - make no mistake.<br /><br />I really enjoy the first four songs - especially \\"Hallow Man\\" and \\"Supernatural Superserious\\".  Michael Stipe's vocal abilities haven't changed too much over the years, but what I never hear anyone go on about is how much Mike Mills' harmonies really help make the band.  I've always been a fan of Peter Buck's guitar playing.<br /><br />'Accelerate' isn't as fun as 'Document', 'Reckoning' or 'Murmur' - but it's not meant to be. Of course, I just might be stuck in my own nostalgia.  But 'Accelerate' takes the energy of the old R.E.M. and sticks them in the present.
0451197879|4.0|There are four books inside the Bachman Books; Roadwork is the weakest of the four. That being said, early Stephen King is good Stephen King. It's lean and mean, written with a tone that isn't so much trying to scare you as it is trying to hurt you. And I love that about King. It's the--screw you reader, take it and shut up--that I love about early King. It might not be the best work he has done, but it's still better than 99% of everyone else. If you love early King, read it.<br /><br />James Roy Daley, author of The Dead Parade<br />[[ASIN:1934861103 The Dead Parade]]
B0013FSL3E|4.0|i saw this movie with my sister at the drive-in when i visited her over 4th Of July weekend. we both liked it. in my opinion it was one of the best disney CGI movies since TOY STORY 1 and 2. it had a very good story about how Earth was abandoned after becoming too polluted to sustain human life. Enter WALL*E a lone robot on earth who spends his days clearing out trash until he meets EVA. not to give away the plot things begin to happen for the humans on board a sort of Noah's Ark type spacecraft when WALL*E gives EVA a plant that he's been caring for in a boot during his down time.
3822837849|4.0|To all those who have wondered, like me, what it was like to page through Stieglitz's \\"Camera Work\\" this is a great oppotunity.  This thick tome contains all the images from the highly reguarded publication for a very low price.  However, as I often find to be the case with Taschen books, this volume lack the hard cover and size needed to convey the power of these images.  While I can understand that by allowing \\"Camera Work\\" to be owned for the price of lunch brings luxury to anyone.  I feel that an additional larger volume would immortalize a work that, before now, could only be viewed in its entirety by a select few.

031606792X|1.0|Hi guyz, this is your favorite book reviewer slash model slash all around fabulous, ME!    I got an advanced copy of this book back, like, 9 issues of Vogue ago, and I just finished having my butler read it to me.  I SO did not enjoy this book you guyz.    First of all, the author's name reminds me of Oscar Meyers.  And I DEFINITELY D-to-the-O-to-the-N-O-T, NOT, eat processed meat.  Like, EW!?  MY bologna has a first name and it's called my boyfriend's p - never mind, let's move on.    Secondly of all, everything that happened to Bella in this book is just sooooo BORING!  She had sex, she turned into a vampire, she got special powers so she didn't succumb to bloodlust, she can create a magical shield to protect a hundred people from the Volturis, AND her crazy jealous lover Jake got over her and will protect her daughter forever.  Seriously you guyz, why would I be interested by ANYTHING that happened in this book?  I'm already LIVING the perfect life with NO consequences, why would I want to READ about hers?    Don't buy this book girls, because it will be such a let down when you find out the only person who can be like Bella is yours truly, ME!  I'm the only girl on Earth who can lead a life with no consequences, no angst, no character development, no emotional growth, exert no effort, and still have everything end happily.    So take it from me, your one and only Paris, don't buy this book.  Just watch me on The Simple Life, it's on DVD for like 20 or 500 dollars.  I honestly have no idea how much anything below a thousand dollars cost.    Oh yeah, not like I care or anything, but like WAY more people watched me have sex than there are who read about Bella's.  THAT'S hot.
B001CDLATE|5.0|If you own a large HD television then this should be the first movie you watch on it.  This is what, as another reviewer already noted, Bluray was made for.  One of the best (artsy) movies of all time.  A master piece.
0375703764|5.0|A book about a book written by an old man about a movie that never was, compiled by a young man with a psychotic mother and a broken life.  It's a rich universe contained in a single volume, and it is amazing as long as you forget that none of it is real.    Doubtlessly, people will be drawn to one or both of the substories within.  People who compared it to the Blaire-Witch focuses on the fictitious movie, The Navidson Project.  Others enjoy how life mirrors art, as Johnny Truant's life is reflected in the House, which in turn reflects those that live within.    To me, the most important question a lover of literature can ask of this book is : where does its merit come from?    To me, respectable works contribute in one of two ways, they either elevate the beauty of the language, or they synthesize what comes before them.  For instance, Lolita by Nabokov has been described as the author's love affair with English.  A ground breaking thesis by Hawking or Newton synthesize the theories and observations of those in the past.  Shakespeare was in a unique position to do both.  Many of his most famous plays were rewrites of past works - he just happened to be the most eloquent person to write it then, and ever since.    Experimental fiction like the House of Leaves are experimental because they do not fall neatly into either camp.  This comes from a dominant theme in the genre of breaking the boundary between reader and book.  The relationship of Johnny with The Navidson Project is analogous to us readers as we go through this book.  We are drawn in, all the while fascinated by the absurdity of believing so much in the reality of the fiction.  In a way, it's a statement of our perception of reality itself - break it down far enough and we only find bits of our dreams and imaginations.  Conversely, when fiction piless upon itself exponentially, reality is born.

B000NTPDSW|3.0|It is hard to understand that with the digital restoration, they could clean up and fix many things in the image for the GODFATHER films, yet they could let the jarring white spots run throughout the films.  The white spots are even more shocking esepcially when the films have  a dark composition.  Even if the spots are branded on the masters, they could have masked or removed these spots digitally, since they did a frame by frame restoration.      There is no point of the blu ray technology with its depth and resolution when we cannot get \\"pure\\" images as promised, and when white spots that could be easily fixed or removed ruin the images.    The studios should have a budget to fix this problem.  They could spend hundreds of millions on a film, but fail to spend a bit on fixing the white spots on the blu ray releases.  Blu ray should have a clean and perfect picture AT LEAST, and should surpass the theatrical experience with dirty and scratched prints (and those black spots when reels are changed), especially when Blu ray discs are not cheap.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Man.... simply awesome record... they did it againg.. after so many years.  You know songs with a 2-3 minutes introduction, 2-3 minutes of lyrics and 2 minutes of endings.... makes this record a must have if you like heavy riffs and powerful balads....
B00140PK6O|5.0|Loved this series.  The values they believed in and lived.  Hard to find nowadays.  Much to be learned from their integrity.  Well acted and beautifully filmed.  Have lent it out to others who have never heard of it and they loved it to and don't want to give it back.
0783114893|5.0|This is a brilliant movie because...well of many things.  Most noteworthy is the transformation of C. Thomas Howell's character, which goes from the average kid driving across the country, to the man who is ready to meet the battle head on.  And the build-up of suspense and tension is pretty good..had me on the edge of my seat several times.<br />Plus it has a great ending, where you come out of it and feel that all is right again with the world, because the battle ended with good triumphing over evil.<br />Not a movie I'd recommend for younger kids though...there isn't a lot of gore, but the scare factor is there...plus the bad guy isn't some alien, he looks like the guy you pass on the street.
B001AZI1PA|5.0|This one of the most delightful movies I've ever seen. The quest story is as old as mankind but here it is told in such a captivating and charming manner that this film remains in a class of its own. You'll find a spectacular array of appealing & revolting creatures and marvelous twists in the plot. One of my favorite scenes is where the two Gelflings fall over a cliff; as the boy panics, the girl spreads her wings, the boy says: \\"But I don't have wings\\" to which the girl replies: \\"Of course not - you're a boy.\\"<br /><br />The fact is that all the species come across as very real and believable - from the kindly and wise Mystics to the human Podlings to the frightening and hideous Skeksis. The meal scene in the Skeksis castle is particularly vivid and memorable, particularly when dessert is served, although it's not for the squeamish. The visit to the lair of the witch Ogra is also quite humorous and spectacular, and I loved the little doggie, if it is a dog.<br /><br />This is in the class of [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings]] - The Motion Picture Trilogy exactly 20 years before the latter was made, although it's probably not fair to compare the two. For one thing, Dark Crystal convinces with its world of believable puppets, which adds a unique flavor to the film. I cannot fault this little gem on any aspect: the old myth is infused by new life here because of the marvelous turns in the plot, the scenes are so colorful you cannot forget them, the characterization is of the highest caliber, and the cinematography is breathtaking.
0375826726|4.0|Although some would say that this latest work (Brisinger) is long-winded or a fairy tale, those same people ought to stick to reading tech-manuals and how-to books.  It's non-fiction; it's supposed to be fun, and it is! It's another fresh ride in a series of three that's even caught the author by surprize--he's going to have to write a fourth, and, final(?) book now......  I was very pleased with the book BUT disapointed in the seller, Snooper Seller, who delivered the book too late and didn't bother to explain or apologize for the blunder.
B000CFWP4C|4.0|Eurythmics made some of the greatest sounds of the 1980 in many genres, not just the standard synth-pop. Lennox & Stuart also made a major contribution in the forgotten band [[ASIN:B00000JOOJ The Tourists]] before the birth of Eurythmics. Unfortunately this album contains too many tracks already available on [[ASIN:B0000DEO9Z Greatest Hits]].<br /><br />Some less inspired songs from the 1990s have been added. This really shows a lack of interest and imagination in view of the huge treasure trove of classic album tracks. The compilers could have chosen The Last Time from [[ASIN:B0000CFXNS Revenge]], Jennifer from [[ASIN:B0000CFXNP Sweet Dreams]], Shame & Beethoven (I Love to Listen to) from [[ASIN:B0000CFXNT Savage]], When the Day Comes Down from [[ASIN:B0000CFXNU We Too Are One]] and Belinda & She's Invisible Now from the obscure first album [[ASIN:B0000CCZ3F In the Garden]].<br /><br />But for those who never got round to Greatest Hits, it's a worthwhile purchase. Every rhythm they took, they made their own: consider the catchy calypso of Right By Your Side, grand rock ballads like Thorn In My Side and When Tomorrow Comes or the perfect pop of Love is a Stranger. Their emotional range is unique: the chilling menace of You Have Placed A Chill In My Heart makes a stark contrast to the joyful exuberance of There Must Be An Angel or the powerful affirmative Sisters Are Doing it for Themselves.

B00000G5VY|5.0|Eurythmics was responsible for some of the most memorable sounds of the 1980s, a series of songs like a string of gemstones. That often-awarded, seldom-merited title The Perfect Pop Song applies to their bittersweet Love Is A Stranger (and Perfect Pop Video for the same song). Lennox & Stuart also made a major contribution in the forgotten band [[ASIN:B00000JOOJ The Tourists]].<br /><br />Every rhythm they took, they made their own: consider the eurythmocalypso of Right By Your Side. The cutting edge of the side mentioned in that song became Thorn In My Side, along with When Tomorrow Comes an example of the fierce beauty attained in their ballads.<br /><br />Their emotional range is unique: compare the chilling menace of You Have Placed A Chill In My Heart to the joyful exuberance of There Must Be An Angel. Lennox & Stewart encapsulate all that is special & valuable in the music of the 80s, a decade that belonged to them as much as it did to Prince, Madonna and Bruce Springsteen.<br /><br />Most of the best are here, with a few regrettable omissions. The first and most glaring is Shame, their 1986 tribute to 60s pop. Also missing are the oriental flavored Belinda and the mournful She's Invisible Now from the obscure first album [[ASIN:B0000CCZ3F In the Garden]].

B001FB4W0W|5.0|This new HBO series from Alan Ball is absolutely addicting!  It is hot, sexy, charming, has incredible writing, a wonderful ensemble cast, and great music.  This is the first show in a long long time that leaves me counting the days in anticipation for the next episode. The Bill and Sookie romance is brilliant, steamy, and THE BEST part of the entire series.  No. I haven't read the books and honestly don't want to because the steam literally jumps out of the TV screen with the chemistry between them. MORE! MORE! MORE!
B001ESYAJY|4.0|It´s not as good as Casino Royale, but it´s a very good soundtrack - it´s something new. Saying it´s horrible just because there´s no main theme would be stupid, even if it was true, which it´s not - in case you´re deaf, the leitmotif is repeated through the whole album, for instance in tracks 7, 9 or 18, and because it´s usually using the melody of the theme song, it´s not as expressive as in other bond soundtracks (those who´ve heard Another way to die know what I mean). The music is more moody and  melancholy, but other parts have a really good pace. In short, if you liked the previous bond soundtracks by david arnold, definitely buy it!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Where to begin? Blade Runner is one of the single greatest films of all time.  If this movie was simply the Final Cut released with no Special Features it would still be a five star item.  However, with the 9 hours of special features and five versions of the film, all in glorious, glorious 1080P this item can truthfully be described as one of the finest film deals available on the market.  If you haven't already done so, order this item promptly, it belongs in the Blu Ray Collection of any fan of good movies, and especially any fan of science fiction.  The transfer to Blu Ray is phenomenal as it the sound.  It is kind of a bummer that the special features are not in HD but that is such a minor point compared to all of the high points of this item that you should not allow it to prevent you from acquiring this item promptly.  Simply the best!

B001BTG3OQ|4.0|Fellow Wedding Photographers! Please listen! The SB-900's thermal shutdown is a very serious problem for us. I received my SB-900 last Thursday and shot a wedding on Saturday. YES! The thermal shutdown Grinch got me!  Even after I read the reviews complaining about the problem, I rationalized it by thinking, well I probably don't shoot as fast as they do. WRONG! It got me after just 6 full power exposures!<br /><br />As background, I've used a SB-800 for a couple of years shooting fairly rapidly and never had a problem with overheating. I likely had overheating, but the SB-800 flash withstood the stress. Not so with the SB-900's thermal shutdown feature. Reluctantly, I'm turning \\"thermal shutdown\\" OFF in the setup menu. Why? Because I love the SB-900 otherwise! It's a wonderful step above the 800. But now I may risk warranty repair problems should something happen.<br /><br />I hate being put into that position by Nikon! I've been loyal to the brand since 1964's Nikon F days. Hopefully Nikon will come up with a cure, especially since the 900 has the ability for it's software/parameters to be remotely updated.<br /><br />In the meantime, wedding photographers, you're taking a big chance the unit will shut down just when important shots happen, unless you disable the thermal shutdown protection mode.<br /><br />I'm still rating the SB-900 as 4 stars, since all else seems fantastic. ATTN: NIKON! Please fix this problem!
0743486285|4.0|Very very good but, I liked THE DIRT better.  You get a lot of info that you probably already knew.  However, this book is very fun and very dark.  A somewhat distrubing look into the lifestyle of a rock and roll addict.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|So, my story for this album is kind of an interesting one.  I've been a fan of Dream Theater for many years now, but like many I was less than thrilled with the last couple of albums they put out.  \\"Train of Thought\\" was boring, stale, and mechanical, and \\"Octavarium\\", while a much stronger effort, didn't really hold my interest for long.  So, that sadly resulted in very low expectations for this album.  In fact, I almost passed up on it entirely.  However, after finally picking it up, many repeated listens, and an excellent live show last year, I am glad to say that they've really bounced back.  This is by far the strongest album they've made in many years.  Not their best by a longshot, but still a huge step up.<br /><br />Like \\"Train of Thought\\", it's mostly pretty dark and heavy, but unlike that album, it's full of great diversity and interesting musicianship and songwriting.  Bookended by the super-huge two-part epic \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\", it covers plenty of ground in-between.  The album has a sort-of single in \\"Forsaken\\", which is crunchy goth-tinged metal.  Plus the lyrics are about vampires, and vampires are always money in the bank (and Halloween's coming up, so don't forget to add it to your \\"monster mix\\").  \\"Constant Motion\\" is good and thrashy, with a lot of Metallica influence, and some more aggressive half-screamed/half-rapped vocals which Mike describes as them \\"turning into Biohazard\\".  Pretty cool stuff.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" is easily one of the most intense and experimental things they've ever done. Sounding like a mad cross between Mudvayne, Mr. Bungle, Machine Head, and Symphony X, it comes roaring from your speakers like the beastly creature its lyrics describe.  This song was surprisingly good live too.  I wasn't sure James would be able to pull off those vocals, but it wasn't half bad.<br /><br />The next three songs chill things down a bit.  \\"Repentance\\" is moody and atmospheric, and features cool spoken word bits from a lot of cool people, like Mikael Akerfeldt, Daniel Gildenlow, Corey Taylor, Neal Morse, and many others.  \\"Prophets of War\\" is a really catchy Muse/Queen hybrid, with excellent politcal lyrics, and an awesome rap/spoken word interlude from Mike (maybe my suspicions were correct, and he and Aesop Rock are the same person after all...ok, maybe not).  Anyway, despite being pretty blatanly derivative, it's a really fun song.<br /><br />\\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\" is perhaps my favorite of the album.  It's huge and epic, with grand sweeping melodies, and some of the coolest and most emotional lyrics they've ever written.  IMO, this is hands-down one of their best songs to date.<br /><br />And finally we have the even bigger \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\".  I have to admit, this song took a pretty long time to grow on me as a whole.  There are some instrumental parts, mainly in part 2, that could probably stand to not be there, but overall this song has a lot of cool stuff.  Heavier parts, softer parts, nifty chanting (fun for a live show, of course).  It's not perfect, but it's a heck of a ride.  Plus, John Petrucci proves again that he's one of few people who can write spiritual/religious themed lyrics that don't make me queasy.<br /><br />Anyway, this is just a great effort on Dream Theater's part, and I really hope they keep this quality up for the next album.  Ok, so they still sometimes go overboard on the instrumental stuff, and they still sometimes wear their influences much too blatantly on their sleeves, but overall this is excellent songwriting.  If you've never liked Dream Theater before, this probably won't change your mind, but for the longtime fan there's plenty to enjoy.  Also, the making-of DVD is worth checking out as well, with footage from the recording sessions, lots of interesting tidbits about the writing process (complete with James hilariously and unknowingly confusing telepathy with telekinesis), and of course Mike's usual goofy antics.  All in all, a great buy.<br /><br />Oh, and just a random thing: A while back, I read a review somewhere that said that with this album, they were attempting to appeal to the \\"mallcore crowd\\".  Now, I've been out of high school for a few years now, and as such have mostly lost touch with said \\"mallcore crowd\\", but if they're now listening to 10-minute epics full of fast solos and odd time signatures, then things must have really changed.  Who knew, huh?A while back, I read a review somewhere that said that with this album, they were attempting to appeal to the \\"mallcore crowd\\".

0446691437|2.0|If you have already read psychology books dealing with the topic of procrastination   (in this book called resistance), then you might find this book a little bit boring.   It is more kind of an essay about this topic from the perspective a professional writer (a person who wants to be creative) than a handbook how to fight it. If you are interested in the topic of procrastination, I would rather recommend to read the chapter about procrastination from the book Feeling Good. Or recently I read the book Power of full engagement, which is addressing this topic as well and offer more tricks.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|With the Winchesters' dad gone, they are truly on their own except for a friend or two.  All they have is each other, though I wish I could count the Impala.  Some spoilers may follow.......                There is an even darker tone this season, if you can imagine that, with Dean having made a literal deal with the devil to save Sam by going to hell--which he absolutely does not deserve.  There is constantly a sense of time running out, with Lilith doing awful things to our boys and to others, Dean doing some crazy things because he knows what's coming, and Sam looking at him with a blend of pity, fear, and heartbreak over his brother's horrific fate.  I won't soon forget the last few minutes of this season's final episode, and I don't want to reveal them here.      Since there is a season four, I can only hope that Sam finds a way to rescue Dean.  On a lighter note, the gag reel is very funny, as they always are.
B001E1GXPA|3.0|Not a bad album just a step back to the \\"Ascendancy\\" sound which   is okay... but I prefer \\"The Crusade.\\" I wish Matt Heafy would  be more consistent with his style of singing. I prefer when he  sounds like James Hetfield like on \\"the Crusade\\" CD. The music   on this CD is more intense and less commercial. It is the singing  on this that makes the less enjoyable for me which is why I can  only give it 3 stars...
B00004NHCC|5.0|If I had to pick a \\"Desert Island\\" CD of Sarah Vaughan (a.k.a. \\"Sassy\\"), I'd go to my remote island with this one.  Sarah recorded countless LP's during her lifetime in a variety of settings, ranging from full-blown orchestras, syrupy strings, a jazz combo or trio, or even with just a piano by her side.  This one features her with just a quintet of jazz players in the recording studio, and I think it's her BEST!      I always felt she performed at her best when she was in a quiet unobtrusive setting where there were only a few people around her as opposed to 40 or 50 people as in a big band or violin string situation.  The producer Bob Shad is very smart to let each song flow unhurriedly in a mellow way.  He knew with Sassy at full ease, she'd be able to take the song in a unique direction.  Each song clocks in at least over 5 or 6 minutes long, which is almost unheard of in today's commercial \\"let's make a quick buck\\" mentality.      It's very clear everyone wanted to make a recording that captures the feel of a late-night jazz setting.   Picture yourself in a smoke-filled darkened jazz room with your friends or love one beside you with a martini on the table, quietly enjoying Sarah and Her Friends.  The imagery evoked by this CD recording is so strong that it literally takes you to one of those (now defunct) West Village nightclubs in New York (ah....those were the days!!)    The icing on the cake is having Clifford Brown, the famed trumpeter, on this recording with Sarah.  Cliffy (as his friends called him) would die in a car crash only a few months after this recording, and all jazz critics consider his presence here with Sarah Vaughan as one of his lasting legacies.    The song selection here is SUPERB, each one an instant Classic and almost made definitive by Sarah Vaughan.  Most tracks would be recorded by the likes of Sinatra, Ella, Bennett, Streisand, but I think it is Sarah's unhurried, mellow, smooth interpretation that remains definitive.  If you don't believe me, just listen to \\"September Song\\" and \\"Embraceable You\\" by Sassy here, then listen to the same songs performed by the likes of Sinatra, Bennett, Streisand, etc. and you will come back to Sassy's version.  It's THAT Good !!  Her \\"Embraceable You\\" can never be topped.    Thanks to Verve Records for the beautiful remastering job.  Details previously not heard are now heard in true form.  You do hear the \\"hiss\\" on some tracks, but that's because the hiss was present on the master tape as well, plus the high level of treble to bring out the full details of the recording.  Please do yourself a favor -- if you're a jazz fan or enjoy jazz singing and playing at its finest, please get this wonderful CD.
B000Q7ZO8U|2.0|The 2 star rating is strictly based on the 3D QUALITY of the blu-ray release... NOT THE MOVIE.        I originally saw Polar Express in 3D on the IMAX screen (which utilized polarized 3D glasses).  It was an awesome spectacle!  The 3D effects were so crisp, clear and beautiful.  If you buy this expecting it to look like it did in the theater, you'll be very disappointed.      It seems that the 3D polarization technique used at the movies theaters (for releases such as \\"Polar Express\\", \\"Journey To the Center of the Earth\\" and \\"Beowulf\\") is not yet used for home DVD presentation.  Had I done some research before this purchase, I would have known this.  Instead, it comes with 4 pairs of the old style anaglyph (red/blue) glasses.  The 3D picture was not good.  I could still see double images (which looked like ghosting).  My eyes were far too distracted to watch it that way.  Fortunately it comes with the 2D version, so I switched over to that (which looked great).      If you already own the 2D blu-ray version, stick with that one and don't bother with this.  No really... don't bother.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Though it deviated occasionally from the original text (thank you, producers, for a much more satisfying final scene) this is a wonderful production that remains true to the original's intent without being too dreary.   For those who have input into young ladies' lives, this has been a helpful tool to talk about the role of women in society (as helpers, advocates, truth-sayers and compassion-givers) and is perfectly clean and acceptable.  I lend my period films out to a wide range of people, and always get hearty thanks for this movie.  Well worth owning.
0312330855|5.0|I have read several of Mr. Herriot's veterinary adventures and have delighted in all of them. His writing takes me back to a better place on this earth when life made sense. I will always cherish his little experiences and I have a greater appreciation for the country vet's talents and humor. What a dedicated lot they are.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|For those of you who think that love is about serving and giving to another, and not about gratifying your own needs - please take my advice and avoid this film.   Aside from one storyline, I detected no real love in any of the plots in this film. There is no time for character development in this mishmash of stories, so the director didn't bother with it and simply jumped to intimacy. I usually love divergent story-line plots, but this movie was a disappointment on all levels. It panders to those who would, with glazed and vapid eyes, fall into a relationship with someone they hardly know and then wonder why they walk away, soon after (very soon after) with bruised hearts and warped ideas about love.  I am surprised by the positive reviews it received. I guess our culture is really more concerned with the appearance of love than the gritty, sacrificial, gradual and deep, \\"actual\\" thing.  If I could give a negative rating to a film - for destroying or at least misrepresenting that which it claims to tout - I would do so here. Films like this give young, impressionable women wholly unwise behavior patterns that are ultimately destructive to their ability to create a long-lasting relationship with an honorable (and perhaps less dashing) man.
B00005JPSM|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It's light, but has some emotional depth. It's sweet, but not cloying. It's fun, but no comedy. The soundtrack is playful and serious - opera and easy-listening, just like the movie.  However, I have to agree with other reviewers that the German original, Bella Martha, was superior in it's nuanced performance.  If you won't watch movies with subtitles and want a relatively clean (only suggested intimacy, nothing visible), sweet romance to watch on chick-flick night, this is a good choice. If you want a more subtle, endearing version of the film - watch the original. I own the original and borrow the remake :-)
0439023483|4.0|I'd heard so much positive feedback on this one, that I went in with fairly high expectations. Fortunately, I was uninformed as to any particulars, so the entire premise was a surprise. All I knew was that it was dystopian. And that I liked the cover.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen lives in District 12--the furthest flung of the twelve districts of Panem--in what's left of North America. Every year the Capitol (the governing city of Panem) puts on the Hunger Games. The Games are a brutal reminder of the districts' failed rebellion. Each district is forced to offer up two of their youth as a tribute. Chosen by lottery, the 24 tributes are then forced to engage in a free-for-all battle to the death on live television. The victor wins fame, glory, and food and supplies for his or her district. This bloodbath is considered the height of entertainment in the Capitol. So far, so horrifying.<br /><br />Sixteen-year-old Katniss is the sole provider for her family. With a mother barely able to go through the motions after her father died, and a younger sister who looks to her for everything, Katniss's days are consumed by hunting, trading, and bartering for their lives. Her one friend, a young man named Gale, leads a similar life and the two work as a team, eking out the bare essentials of existence for themselves and their families. Until the 74th Hunger Games roll around and Katniss's little sister is chosen for the tribute. Without a second thought, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place. And just like that, the games are on. What I loved about this book was the grim world of Panem. Katniss's unenviable life goes from bleak to awful in the blink of an eye and the horror is never cut with cream. In fact, the creep factor only escalates with time and the whole thing ratchets up to a terrifying ending that I, for one, did not anticipate. Brava, Ms. Collins! Katniss herself grew on me until, by the end, I cared very much what happened to her and no longer blamed her so much for being quite so cold. Her situation is not (and never has been) conducive to warmth.<br /><br />On a side note, this book reminded me quite a bit of [[ASIN:015206396X Graceling]] by Kristin Cashore. Both have heroines with Kat names. Katniss and Katsa. Both girls are forced to kill to stay alive. Both are manipulated and lied to on a regular basis and, unsurprisingly, have difficulty sorting out their emotions and figuring out who to trust. Both of them find the possibility of eventual happiness an unlikely prospect at best. Both books built up to rather killer endings and, most frustratingly of all, both are the first books in a trilogy. I'm seriously going to have to go find myself a series entirely in print to help pass the time. I am always waiting for sequels...quite so cold.

B00000DWPK|5.0|Though this is not my favourite Pink Floyd recording (both \\"Dark side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish you were here\\" are better in my opinion), it is undoubtely a great one. I have different editions, but I find that this Mobile Fidelity is really the best one. The main difference with the others, is that Mobile Fidelity has taken great care in respecting the great dinamic diferences between the soft and loud moments of the recording. This is very important in times of saturated remastering. The difference is not subtle and it is worth to buy it, though some of the prices for the used cd's are exagerated.
0525478183|3.0|John Green knows how to end a book. You always hear about killer first lines and great beginnings, but it has got to be harder to end a story well. To know what to do with and to the characters and story you've crafted. I thought [[ASIN:014241221X Looking for Alaska]] had the most beautiful closing lines. The wrap up in [[ASIN:0142412023 An Abundance of Katherines]] was just right. And my favorite thing about PAPER TOWNS is undoubtedly the ending. Kind of nice to hear going in, isn't it?<br /><br />So the story follows Q (short for Quentin) in his life-long quest to love girl-next-door Margo Roth Spiegelman. The thing is, she's sort of too cool for school, let alone Q. But one night she climbs through his bedroom window and absconds with him on a night full of adventure, breaking, entering, and general tomfoolery. Next morning she's gone. Q, with the occasional help of his two band geek friends, Ben and Radar, embarks on a journey to find Margo. Little does he comprehend just what \\"finding\\" her will mean. If it sounds like a combination of his two previous books, it sort of is but sort of not. Q engages in quite a bit of philosophical questioning and yet he is, in all respects, pleasantly without distinction as high school seniors go. This made him rather innocuous and a bit hard to like as much as I'd like to have. He exists on the fringes of every kind of stereotypical teen and seems to be perpetually surprised and amused by them all. It is a very calm, almost low-key book and it was over before I was ready. I wouldn't mind hearing more about Margo and Q (and Radar!) because I felt as though I was only beginning to get a handle on them when the whole thing came to a close. But, as I said, it was a perfect kind of ending.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|A MIDWINTER NIGHT'S DREAM is a mix of old and new Christmas songs from Loreena McKennitt. Loreena essentially took A WINTER GARDEN and released it under another name and added eight more songs to create a sumptuous listening experience to put the listener into the Christmas spirit. As a long time fan of Loreena McKennitt's music, A MIDWINTER NIGHT'S DREAM was a must have for this fan. Loreena could have easily put together a cheesy traditional Christmas album of old Christmas standards but she doesn't. Instead she carefully chose which songs she wanted to put on A MIDWINTER NIGHT'S DREAM. There were a few songs that I wasn't familiar but the beauty of the melodies and Loreena's hypnotic vocals made the listening experience very enjoyable. I loved the instrumental \\"Un Flambeau, Jeannette, Isabelle\\". The melodies had me within seconds. Another wonderful track is \\"Good King Wenceslas\\". I think Loreena's version is my personal favorite of all the versions I have heard over the years. I love how the cover art for A MIDWINTER NIGHT'S DREAM is anything but traditional. All of the songs on the album are wondeful. I really do appreciate the fact that Loreena did not opt to make your standard Christmas album with \\"Silent Night\\" and \\"Away in a Manger\\". That would have been too predictable. Some people might not be happy about it but I'm not one of those people. Once again, Loreena provides for her fans stunning artwork for her cd. I love the uniqueness in the imagery she chose. A MIDWINTER NIGHT'S DREAM is a definite must have for Loreena McKennitt fans. This is one Christmas cd I will be listening to all year round.
0451169514|5.0|I preface this review by stating (somewhat sheepishly) that this is my first horror novel. Honestly? I've always secretly longed to read a Stephen King book, but I never knew where to jump in. So I contented myself with reading [[ASIN:0743455967 On Writing]] and his book reviews, admiring the talent from afar, so to speak.<br /><br />IT begins with a great first line:<br /><br />\\"The terror, which would not end for another twenty-eight years--if it ever did end--began, so far as I know or can tell, with a boat made from a sheet of newspaper floating down a gutter swollen with rain.\\"<br /><br />We are soon introduced to a boy named Bill who stutters and his cute little brother Georgie who, even I can tell, doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell of making it out of this chapter alive. A few pages later I feel certain I should never have opened this book. There's a freaking clown in the storm drain and I find myself truly creeped out and begging Georgie not to go near the storm drain. Just let the paper boat go and walk away, Georgie!<br /><br />But he doesn't.<br /><br />I won't go into the plot too deeply except to say that the story alternates between a series of seminal events in 1958 and again in 1985. The first half depicts the cosmic coming together of seven eleven-year-old kids. Six boys and one girl, self-proclaimed Losers all of them. A stutterer, a wisecracker, a hypochondriac, a fatboy, a birder, a black kid, and a tough girl. These seven form a united front against a trio of unusually vicious bullies. But slowly, and with an almost spine tingling sense of inevitability, they realize they've been brought together for a larger purpose than warding off Henry Bowers and his cronies. Soon they're all in and there's no turning back. Not that any one of them would be able to turn their backs on Stuttering Bill anyway. He is the real heart of the story. The one who never backs down. The one the others would gladly walk through fire for.<br /><br />It's difficult for me to tell you how much I enjoyed this book. I was hoping I would like it, but, like a blind date, I was a little nervous. Merely crossing my fingers for a good time, you know? Out of nowhere, I fell in love. I mean these kids are So Cool. Work their way into your heart and break it sort of cool. They are outcasts struggling to avoid annihilation not only at the hands of their peers but at the clawlike hands of an apocalyptic evil that has held their town in its grasping grip since time immemorial. I didn't stand a chance. I fell in love with them, with their desperate jokes, with the summer of 1958, and with the interlocking charm and horror with which King shapes his tale. But most of all, I fell in love with Bill. Bill with his glorious silver bike and his burning determination to avenge his brother. I loved the quiet, unassuming way he gathered the other misfits together and made them a part of something important, something noble.<br /><br />I can't believe I waited this long to read IT. I stayed up nights reading, glancing over my shoulder every few seconds, looking for something orange and silver creeping up behind me, scared to the tips of my toes but unable to put it down.book.

As a cartoonist, I have often struggled with trying to get a grip on drawing a human quickly and effortlessly. Sure, I have all the other books, but I came across this one accidently while browsing at my local bookstore. On a whim and to see if I had grasped the major concepts correctly, I used a book on dinosaurs and an advert I received in the mail as a starting point. I drew my rectangles and used a pyramid as the main body and I instantly saw an improvement in my drawing quailty and characterization with a more forceful feeling.

B001EZ78T6|4.0|DISCLAIMER: This is more an initial assessment than a review, I have only listened to the album twice so it's a bit early for a full review<br /><br />There are a few of my favourite artists who are on their third go round and almost all of them have decided to do a 180 on their core fans. The 1st was Alicia Keys whose 3rd album was less soul and more pop/rock. Raphael Saadiq went Motown, Robin Thicke was all over the place and Ne-Yo toyed with the idea of going europop. It scares me to think what D'Angelo will do given that his sophomore effort was already way out there.<br /><br />John Legend takes a page straight out of Alicia Key's book by going the pop route and to be honest I am not pleased. I applauded Alicia's effort because it was an evolution of sorts from talented girl to woman. In John's case he scores no points and as far as I'm concerned this is a regression not an evolution.<br /><br />The world has enough artists doing the pop thing and we look to artists like John Legend, Raphael Saadiq and Robin Thicke to give us something else (pun intended). By including a Ne-Yo, Will.I.Am and a Pharell song (no offense to any of them) John has only thing in mind...and that is Radio (Trying not to be out done by his own artist, Estelle).<br /><br />The duet with Brandy is good but it does not belong on a John Legend album. The Michael Jackson esque rallying call that closes out the standard version of the disc is right on the edge of corny (perfect for radio). I can understand why he might choose that direction, given how his last album performed, the critics loved it but radio wouldn't play it. I would counter that argument by saying that he just needs to look at the album sales which were nothing to laugh at.<br /><br />With that said, I still have to admit that although I disagree with his direction, the album as a whole is quite well executed. You can still here that it has John's stamp all over it. He also sprinkled a few tracks that recall his previous album e.g. \\"Good Morning\\" and my current favourite \\"I Love, You Love\\". The reggae influenced tracks are also repeat worthy. I'm sure the rest of the album will grow on me as the other's have.ourite \\"I Love, You Love\\".

0395775590|5.0|As an African American learning lititure in high school I always lamented the chance to read a novel OTHER than a European classic. Upon confronting my teacher I was told that we would read Othello the following month. Since this terrible experience I have been in search of African and African American literature to quench that thirst that was so brutally dismissed in high school. By luck I eventually came across this book which I later found out is considered the most widely read book in African Literature. The novel is about the life of Okonkwo and the Igbo tribe. The novel is by most standards small (only a few hundred pages) and a very easy read. The language is simple and the characters and narrative is clear. All this being said this is one of the most powerful novels that I've had the recent delight of reading. It's the simplicity of it that drives the core ideals to your heart. You feel like a an explorer as you get an up close view of the social networks, religion and eventual imperialism that shapes the lives of these people. After reading this book I feel I took away a greater understanding of African culture as well as a truer love for its people.
B0009WQ3P0|3.0|In 1992 Fleetwood Mac had reached their 25th year as a band. This {now deleted} 4 CD box set was the half-hearted attempt by the band's record company to celebrate  a 1/4 century of the music from the mighty mac, but it lacks a bit of the attack that made them mighty to begin with.<br /><br />Well, there is both good news and bad to report about this box set collection. With 72 tracks included here, there is a good portion of songs {11} that represent the early Peter Green years of 1967-1970. Nine selections appear from the \\"Middle Years\\" {post Green, pre Buckingham-Nicks.} And the rest is of course from the Buckingham-Nicks years of 1975 onwards. Some tracks are presented in alternate mixes {\\"Lay It Down\\", \\"Angel.\\"} Five un-released tracks mark their first appearance on a Fleetwood Mac CD. A new batch of songs (four) new recordings were produced for inclusion on this set.<br /><br />There is a lot of music here to explore over the course of these four discs. And for fans of post-1975 editions of the band, this could be an education for them to discover the first seven years {1967-1974} of FM. The early years range from raw blues to the California rock of the Kirwan/McVie/Welch years of cool excellent pop/rock music. The main focus of this set has set it's sights on the post-1975 version of Fleetwood Mac that exploded the band into a multi-million selling pop-rock sensation. The Buckingham/Nicks years include all the hit songs and great key album cuts that hold up well right next the top 40 material. A wealth of great music of classic pop/rock and blues can be found in this band's long history.<br /><br />The bad news to report is that the packaging of this Box is far less than Fleetwood Mac deserves. The booklet contains many posed studio portraits of Christine and Stevie from the Rumours and Tusk years. But no information concerning  the Band's history is included here. A book would have covered the dramas and the musicial history of this great band quite nicely, but you will not find that document herein. There is much fluff, but little substance to go with the fine music that is presented here.<br /><br />I do like this collection, but even with the treasures you will find within this, I wish that when the 50th year of the group rolls around in 2017, a much better produced set Of Fleetwood Mac's music will be brought forth.<br />Three Stars.but you will not find that document herein.

B001EOOQEM|3.0|It's amusing that Warner Bros. has chosen to remaster the Black Sabbath/Dio titles first. That being said, this title was a good one but not spectacular. Aside from the well-known tracks, the others come off as  fair. Good performances to be sure and an impressive debut for Dio. The remastering however sounds like a straight-normalise-the-volume-levels job to me. There is plenty of bass but the high end is lacking. I was  hoping for some better overall clarity in the vocals. Personally, I always thought this was a muddy recording. I wonder if the U.K. remaster sounds any different. The booklet is average with liner notes/credits but no lyrics. And where are the bonus tracks? 8 tracks/40.12.

B001DMJ9R4|5.0|LBC was great, BUT I have to say, their Asian tour was them totally in top form. The rest they took before the Asian tour totally rested them and M. Shadows' voice was flawless. They were never once out of breath and everyone agreed that they sounded even better than in their album. But who cares?! A7X rocks, and so does this DVD. The songs in Diamonds in the Rough are totally mind blowing. I loved the songs even on the first listen. I know of many people who thought that they didn't do Pantera justice in the Walk cover and that Dimebag's rolling in his grave and whatever, BUT seriously, A7X totally updated the song and made it almost their own. The Fight and Dancing Dead got me hooked on the album, and I listen to the album DAILY, it's almost as if they released another album altogether. If anyone who is an Avenged Sevenfold fan hasn't bought this DVD, then I suggest you hurry up and get your behind to the nearest CD store, and if you're too lazy, then pull out your credit card and have it delivered to your doorstep.     P.S. I'm not promoting Amazon.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|All I can say about \\"Death Magnetic\\" is WOW!!  It's about time!!  Is this Metallica's best album?  Most assuredly not.  That distinction goes to \\"Ride The Lightning\\" for me, but this is most assuredly the best album Metallica has done in 20 years!<br /><br />After the absolutely horrendous \\"St. Anger\\", it remained to be seen whether that would've been the end of the road for Metallica, but although it took 5 years of soul-searching & rehab (not to mention a year-plus just to record the album), Metallica has come back very strong with \\"Death Magnetic\\".  This is the album they should've done after 1991's \\"Black Album\\" instead of being subjected to \\"Load\\", \\"Re-Load\\", and so on.<br /><br />The most notable musical changes on \\"Death Magnetic\\" are the very refreshing return of Kirk Hammett's leads; they were nowhere to be found on \\"St. Anger\\", & also a very tight yet powerful drum sound for Lars' drums, after the \\"tin can\\" sound fiasco of S.A.  The album also finds James Hetfield in much stronger form vocally as well as in his lyrics & overall songwriting.<br /><br />The other notable change is the return of the classic \\"lightning\\" Metallica logo that has been absent on every album since the Black Album.  I've heard many people dissing producer Rick Rubin for the distorted sound on this album, & while there is some distortion present at higher volumes, that's the nature of the beast when using digital recording techniques, especially with Pro Tools & formats of that sort.  To me, this is very small criticism; the most important thing here is that Rubin has reinvigorated the band, & this is apparent all over the album.  Metallica is reborn.<br /><br />After repeated listenings, I haven't found any of the tracks to be weak or filler in any way; you definitely get your money's worth here as none are less than 7 minutes in length.  But this is the key...the songs are long but they are far from boring or repetitive.  The band is tight & terse, the guitars are ferocious, and in general, it kicks butt.  Nuff said!general, it kicks butt.  Nuff said!
B0002O06N0|5.0|From the gothic spookiness of the opener, When the Lights Go Out, to the delicate guitar beauty of The Lengths, to the innovative remake of a classic in Stack Shot Billy, the Black Keys deliver real deal roots music that will please both blues and rock fans who like their music raw and unpolished.     The duo can craft a hook and has pop sensibility, but they rock as hard as anyone and filter their love of the blues through fat and fuzzy guitar tones and pounding drums that would be just as at home in a Delta juke joint as a big city rock venue.    I found the Black Keys on a Fat Possum compilation CD and while this album is the first of theirs I've bought, it won't be the last.
B00005JPO1|4.0|The fourth film in this legendary franchise is old-school fun, with great action scenes that oftentimes go over-the-top and almost out of this world.<br /><br />In a nod to the late-1950s era science fiction thrillers, Dr. Henry Jones, Jr., is in a desperate race with evil agents from the Soviet Union for a psychic alien crystal skull. Though the search ultimately ends in a temple in Peru, it all starts on a military base in the Nevada desert, with \\"Hangar 51\\" home to the remains of an alien that crash landed in Roswell, New Mexico.<br /><br />Harrison Ford does an excellent job in reprising Indiana Jones for what is a return to reigning supreme in the kingdom of action adventure.
015206396X|3.0|I loved the concept of this book from the moment I read the brief descriptions on Amazon.  I was hoping for something on the order of the Belgariad only with a strong female lead.  Unfortunately the execution left something to be desired.<br /><br />The characters and people of the story are very thinly drawn.  We learn very little about even the main character Katsa and how she views the world and those around her.  Her actions and moods seem inexplicable to the reader because we are so infrequently privy to her internal dialogue.  Her history is glossed over and so are the histories of the countries and peoples she encounters (if they are mentioned at all).  This book reminds me of internet Fan Fiction in that it is written as if we should already be familiar with Katsa, the seven countries that make up the world she lives in, her best friend Raffin, et cetera.<br /><br />Also disappointing was the extremely brief and glossed over action scenes.  For a book which supposedly stars a female warrior, the fight scenes rarely warrant more than a few vague sentences (i.e. \\"Katsa kicked the man in the temple and he fell to the ground\\").  It's as if the author did no research at all on physical combat and how it is performed.<br /><br />The book isn't all bad though.  It gets alot of mileage out of the concept of Graces and how the Graced live, and the plot is fairly engaging.  Aside from that, the book is quite obviously a fledgling attempt.  I'm hoping the author matures into her craft before her next title is released.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Director Mark Steven Johnson truly explores the shadowy aspects of justice and vigilantism in the additional 30 minutes added to the film, along with some other tweaks.<br /><br />The scene which didn't make the final cut from producer Gary Foster and 20th Century Fox studio is attorney Matt Murdock (Daredevil) - portrayed by Ben Affleck - defending a murder suspect, who is played by rapper Coolio. The violence is also amped up which earned the revised film an \\"R\\" rating, a path not taken to movie theaters by comic book super heroes and movie studios.<br /><br />Colin Farrell (Bullseye) and Michael Clarke Duncan (The Kingpin) are excellent in their roles as villains, with Jennifer Garner (Elektra Natchios) able to show a different side of the character in this grittier version. Director's have to be daredevils at times in the editing process and this Director's Cut aptly shows - again - who knows best when it comes to delivering a solid film.
1416575464|3.0|This book seems to be aimed at a reader who has limited resources and a very loose  commitment to any particular style.  The book has good ideas for taking 'found' objects, old furnishings, what ever you can talk out of friends and family and combining them so they look good together.    The reader can go to particular problems areas they want to tackle and find ideas to get them started on improving the overall look.    But the book itself is a problem.  The designer of the book has very definite ideas on style that make the book hard to read.  Lots of pale color.  Small type in a light face in light color ink against white or barely contrasting background color.   The illustrations rarely have any saturated color.  The whole look of the book is something left out in the sun to fade.      If you actually want to read this book, you better have very good eyesight and bright lights.
0452289963|3.0|I started to flip through \\"The Power of Now\\" because of the fuss about it at the time, and to my surprise I finished it easily. Here was someone who had been through a real and fascinating spiritual experience.<br />The teachings were simple and repetitive, but that's what works today: few people have the patience to unravel the complex, beautiful, elliptical spiritual teachings of slower ages. There was nothing new in them, but that was also good. Spiritual teachings aren't supposed to be new.<br /><br />You are not your body or your thoughts; you are not any form that can be indicated. You are the timeless Presence beyond all this. The past is only thought: memory, regret, nostalgia. The future too is only thought: hope, expectation, fear. Presence exists only Now, in that instant finer than a hair that is yet vast enough to contain Eternity.<br /><br />So the practice is to stay in the Now unfailingly. This is like Buddhist Mindfulness, but notice the crucial difference of aim. Buddhism teaches No-Self: the point of Mindfulness is to see that There Is Nothing beyond passing thoughts and sensations. Tolle, like Hindu Nondualists, teaches Presence: Something rather than Nothing.<br /><br />But with This book I'm afraid he lost me. Hate to gloom everyone out, but I see no sign of a New Age, a Global Spiritual Awakening. Ask the people in Iraq, Palestine or Somalia about a New Age; ask slum-dwellers in Cairo, Delhi, Manila, Saõ Paulo.<br />More important, why is a Nondualist telling us this? Why this interest in a Coming Age, in the future, in time at all? Whatever arrives is certain to depart again. What Is always Is.<br /><br />When he began to describe the \\"pain body\\" I gave up. Dozens of vague psychological entities have been dreamt up since the days of Freud: this must be one of the least interesting. It's hard not to feel he's pandering to an audience absorbed in their own emotional lives and problems.<br />Try Hindu Nondualist teachers like Ramana Maharshi or Nisargadatta Maharaj. They are just as accessible, and they'll be around a lot longer.ssible, and they'll be around a lot longer.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|Don't get me wrong - I'm an avid fan. I love the story lines that The Krip develops, and I love the overall story arc. I'm confident that this will continue to be a \\"kick a$$\\" series. However, I was more than a little disappointed by the extras this season...    I loved the introduction of the background pieces for some of the episodes. I also felt that while the Gag reel was necessarily shorter (less material with fewer episodes of high jinks to draw from), it still had some great content. I was also very pleased that \\"Bobby\\" received the necessary limelight.     But when all was said and done, I didn't feel it was filled with the love that the first two season packs contained. Specifically...  No Episode Narrations - I love those.  The Impala piece was short and not a little clunky.  Overall it just felt a little underdone. I'm assuming another affect of the shortened season.    Now, despite my little moanfest, this is an awesome series, with fabulous cast and crew, with amazing fans. Each episode stands on its own and deserves absolute support (although I hope I never succumb to mind washed slave like devotion). I will continue to purchase each and every series, and no doubt continue to play them until they are unplayable and I need to purchase new sets. Just like the first two seasons.    :)
0393327655|3.0|Often bracketed with \\"The God Delusion\\", this is a better book, though fuzzy, loosely argued and (I'm guessing) hastily written. At least Harris is intelligent and open-minded enough to see the rationale of Buddhist spiritual practice: one more intuitive leap and he might understand what religion, the Sacred, has meant to the majority of the human race.<br /><br />Shame he wastes so much space on fashionable but silly anti-Muslim tirades. The reader should try going through and replacing the word \\"Muslim\\" with \\"Jew\\", and \\"Islam\\" with \\"Judaism\\", and see if it still looks acceptable, or even printable. Yet the Hebrew Bible contains at least as many exhortations to violence as the Qur`an; and Jews were \\"terrorists\\" too until they achieved their political objectives (anyone remember?) Harris never stops to wonder Why people adopt extreme beliefs: dismissing your opponents as stupid or brainwashed is a game anyone can play, and too easy to be much fun.<br /><br />Muslim compose one quarter of the world's population. It is well-known that in North America and Europe there are hateful, violent White Supremacist, racist, Fascist and neo-Nazi groups. No-one ever thinks to judge all Westerners on this basis. Why then are we so strongly encouraged to vilify all Muslims because of similar minorities?<br /><br />Harris should devote a couple of months to reading the Muslim saints and sages: Rûmî, `Attâr, Sanâ'î, Sa`dî, Jâmî, Suhrawardî, Shabistarî, `Irâqî, Ibn `Arabî, Ibn al-Fârid, al-Hallâj, al-Makkî, Ibn `Ata'illâh, etc, etc, etc. The Islamic tradition is second to none, its spiritual writings astonishing in quantity and quality, uniquely poetic and life-affirming. But Buddhism should already have taught him that beliefs based on fear and hatred are always wrong.
6305531374|4.0|HAPPY THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY, MICHAEL MYERS!!!<br /><br />  Jamie Lee Curtis is finally back as Laurie Strode!!!!  This is definitely the highlight of \\"Halloween:  H20,\\" which takes place exactly twenty years after the original \\"Halloween.\\"  Pretend that parts four through six occur in parallel time.  Better yet, write them off as being one long dream like the viewers had to do when Bobby Ewing was killed by Catherine Wentworth's car on \\"Dallas.\\"<br /><br />  Having faked her own death, Laurie has changed her name to Keri Tate and is the headmistress of a private high school in Northern California.  She is overprotective of her son, John Tate, because she fears Michael will find them.  Where has Michael been for twenty years?<br /><br />  Alas, horror legend Donald Pleasance is dead.  However, Nancy Stephens has returned to reprise her role as nurse Marion Chambers Whittington, the one who was with Dr. Loomis the night Michael Myers escaped from the sanitarium on Halloween eve of 1978.  Michael breaks into her home office and learns where Laurie is hiding.  Naturally, his goal is to kill her and anyone else within easy reach.  He still has an insatiable appetite for bloody carnage and the ability to withstand multiple gunshot wounds.<br /><br />  Jamie Lee Curtis has aged well; her character is stronger, quicker, and wiser than twenty years ago.  She does an excellent job of hiding from and outsmarting her brother.  It was a treat to see Curtis with her real life mom, Janet Leigh of \\"Psycho,\\" who is one of the teachers.  She should've fallen prey to Michael, but she leaves school before the murders begin.  The last time I recall Curtis and Leigh together was in \\"The Fog.\\"  Also rounding out a cast of stars is LL Cool J (\\"Deep Blue Sea\\" and \\"Rollerball\\") as the security guard, Josh Harnett (\\"Faculty\\" and \\"30 Days of Night\\") as John Tate, Michele Williams (\\"Species\\" and \\"Dawson's Creek\\"), and Alan Arkin (\\"Knots Landing\\" and \\"Northern Exposure\\") as the guidance counselor who is secretly dating Laurie though he doesn`t know her true identity.<br /><br />  A higher body count would've made this film more fun.  The school is practically deserted because of a fieldtrip to Yosemite Park.  I would've had about one hundred students in the school; at least a dozen are massacred before the alarms are sounded; and mayhem ensues as the school is evacuated on a cold, stormy night.  Think \\"Halloween\\" meets \\"Terror Train.\\"<br /><br />  The secluded mountain school provides a chilling atmosphere for this holiday slasher.  It would be fun to watch \\"Halloween:  H2O\\" along with the original \\"Halloween,\\" \\"Halloween II\\", and \\"Halloween:  Resurrection.\\"  This film is highly recommended for fans of Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers.dating Laurie though he doesn`t know her true identity.

B000001DTM|5.0|That's exactly what U2 did with their 7th album, Achtung Baby. While many people will say The Joshua Tree is U2's definite album, I would have to go with Achtung Baby as their best album. By beginning with the distorted drums of Zoo Station, you can tell that this is not the same band from the 80s. With Achtung Baby, U2 go into some dark territory. This is probably their darkest album since 1983's War. All the songs on the album stand out, but the main ones that will get your attention will be \\"Zoo Station\\", \\"Even Better Than the Real Thing\\", \\"One\\", \\"Until The End of the World\\", \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\", \\"The Fly\\", and \\"Mysterious Ways.

B000RIWAVW|5.0|HAPPY THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY, MICHAEL MYERS!!!  Thanks to you, Halloween will never be the same.<br /><br />  \\"Halloween\\" is a modern horror classic.  To date, it has spawned seven sequels, one remake, and a host of imitations including some of the best holiday slasher fare.  I was a freshman in high school when \\"Halloween\\" was released thirty years ago on an unsuspecting America.  My classmates were hailing it as a great horror film; they couldn't stop talking about it.  This film went down in history as one of the top grossing independent films.<br /><br />  Expertly directed by John Carpenter and Debra Hill (who also brought us \\"The Fog\\" -  a creepy ghost story), \\"Halloween\\" shocked America with its chilling plot.  What would possess a six-year-old boy from a normal, middle class family and make him stab his teenage sister to death?  Satan possessed him!  Fifteen years later, when the grown Michael Myers escaped from the psychiatric hospital, his psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis (horror icon Donald Pleasance of \\"The Flesh and the Fiends,\\" \\"Raw Meat, and \\"Phenomena\\") insisted he was pure evil, and no longer a human.  This would explain his ability to survive being shot, stabbed, and set on fire.<br /><br />  Jamie Lee Curtis (daughter of \\"Psycho\\" star Janet Leigh) made her film debut as babysitter Laurie Strode; she and her high school friends are stalked by Michael Myers on Halloween.  Curtis gives an outstanding performance as the injured teen who desperately flees the maniac while pleading for help from the neighbors who turn off their front porch lights.  She quickly realizes there really is a Boogeyman.<br /><br />  It is a delight to watch the beautiful P. J. Soles when she plays her usual role as a mischievous, free-spirited girl.  She was a tom boy in \\"Carrie\\" and a cheerleader in \\"Halloween.\\"<br /><br />  Granted, \\"\\"Halloween\\" is not a gory, high body count slasher flick.  However, it does have nail-biting suspense, memorable theme music (on a par with \\"Jaws\\" and \\"Friday the 13th\\"), and history making originality.  \\"Halloween\\" proved that monsters are still real.  They can be the boy next door - the one who killed his sister.<br /><br />  If you haven't seen the original film \\"Halloween,\\" you're in for one of the best Halloween treats in history.  I envy you!history making originality.  \\"Halloween\\" proved that monsters are still real.  They can be the boy next door - the one who killed his sister.

Take my advise, please listen to it at least 4 consecutive times, otherwise you'll not be able to make a full picture. It not as simple as St Anger. This one is more of heavy weight.

B000FA57US|4.0|HAPPY THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY, MICHAEL MYERS!!!<br /><br />  If you read my review for \\"Halloween 4,\\" you know that I rationalized Laurie Strode's death, and other plot inconsistencies, by reasoning that installments four through six occur in the bizarre and mysterious world of parallel time.  It is exactly one year since Michael Myers was shot multiple times and fell into an ancient well.  The evil within him was apparently transferred to his niece, Jamie, when she touched his hand; dressed in a clown costume similar to the one Michael wore when he stabbed his sister, Jamie attempts to stab her step mom to death.  She is now in a children's psychiatric ward in Haddonfield.  (Would a town as small as Haddonfield have one of those?  Only in parallel time.)  Meanwhile, Michael Myers is lying in a coma in the shack of a hermit who lives on a river.  On the eve of Halloween, Myers revives and, to show his gratitude to the old man who took care of him, he kills him.  Myers proceeds to find Jamie and dispatch her.  She can not speak and has developed a psychic link with her uncle.  She can sense when he is near; she is gripped by a seizure whenever he begins to kill someone.<br /><br />  Donald Pleasance returns as Dr. Sam Loomis; he employs some unethical tactics to trap Myers - tactics that jeopardize lives.  Also returning is the cute, adorable Danielle Harris as Myers' niece Jamie Lloyd.  Ellie Cornell reprises her role as Jamie's adorable foster sister, Rachel, who suffers the same fate as the lone survivor of \\"Friday the 13th.\\"  Once gain, Beau Starr is Sheriff Meeker.  Wendy Kaplan is great as the feisty, perky Tina.  This installment introduces another character who will be more prominent in the next sequel; unfortunately, we never get to see his face.  He wears a long black coat and black silver-pointed boots.  (No, it's not Johnny Cash.)  This mystery stranger follows Myers and sets up a satanic shrine in his old house.<br /><br />  In \\"Halloween 5,\\" the acting is inferior to what is seen in other sequels; Myers and Dr. Loomis are often seen lurking in the background, behind trees and bushes, as though waiting for their cues to go into action.  This destroyed the surprise factor.  At first, the body count looks as though it is going to be much lower than its predecessor.  Fortunately, for you high body count fiends like myself, there is the police station massacre, which provides a great ending, much like the one in \\"Slaughter Hotel.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Halloween 5\\" tried to capture the nostalgia of the first \\"Halloween.\\"  There is the friendship that Rachel shares with Tina and Sammi.  However, the movie is more like another sequel of \\"Friday the 13th.\\"  There is a Halloween party at a farm and major characters go into the barn to make love; instead, they fall victim to Myers.  Also, all the partygoers decide to go skinny dipping and poor Tina finds herself alone with corpses and a deranged serial killer.<br /><br />  Yes, \\"Halloween 5\\" is predictable and full of plot holes, but it is still an enjoyable ride through the amusement park of Michael Myers who has clearly established himself as legendary serial killer along with Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger.  This movie is highly recommended for fans of Michael Myers and fans of slasher flicks.  \\"Halloween 4\\" and \\"Halloween 5\\" are better appreciated when they are watched as a double feature, considering they contain many of the same characters and actors and occur one year apart.

B001A3AA0G|5.0|If you like Brian Wilson's later stuff (e.g. Pet Sounds, Surf's Up, Smile), Neil Young, The Band, CSNY or any of those legendary folks, than you will LOVE this album.  I almost lost my faith in pop/rock and was about to limit my listening entirely to classical and soundtracks/scores until I came upon this album.    Fleet Foxes, Wilco, Ray Lamontagne are the REAL indie musicians that you all should be checking out (well...Wilco is pretty big these days...but you get my drift).  Death Cab ain't beans to the Fleet Foxes.  Its not often that you get young guys who can sing 4-5 part harmonies, write good lyrics with strong compositions and can do this LIVE without all the vocal processors and BS.  Definitely check em out...you won't be disappointed.

B001C08RHA|4.0|Finally, a comic-book movie for the 21st century.  Our hero has his flaws; a passion for dumb women and an awkwardness with smart ones.  Our villain has a believable motive; greed, and represents a realistic threat to society, the military - industrial complex.  Iron Man also has a female sidekick who does know his true identity.  And best of all, our hero is not suffused with enough humility to keep his identity under wraps.  What a great movie!  The only flaws were some of the action scenes in which Iron Man takes quite a pounding.  Yes, the suit kept the man whole, but any person going thru those types of G-forces would suffer internal bleeding at a lethal level.

B001DU8T6S|4.0|After being a fan up in Canada for 33 years (since Sheer Heart Attack's cover was closely examined in the vein of \\"who are these strange guys\\" while Killer Queen played loud in the background) - and never seeing them live (missed them, with Freddie, in Edmonton in 1980, I think - because you always think you can \\"catch them\\" on their next tour), I flew over to Holland to see their concert in Rotterdam on October 7.  And it's a kind of magic - seeing these guys.  Even without Freddie (who, of course, is irreplaceable), the trio and their back-up guys were absolutely amazing.  Best concert I have ever seen.    And I bought the UK CD (already released there for a month) at Heathrow...  Finally had a long drive today to listen to it - and the verdict is \\"great\\".  With every new original Queen album after Night at the Opera, I would put the needle down on vinyl and wonder what I was going to hear.  Sometimes it took a couple of listens to hear the genius...  And I am happy to report that after a few more listens, this one meets the test too.  I somehow doubt that fairweather American fans will drive this CD up the charts - with musical taste fading into the likes of 50 Cent and Britney Spears - but I hope that there are enough of us out there to send the message to these amazing musicians that a tour of North America (Brian says, at 61, probably the last big one) is worthwhile.    Enjoy it for what it is - NEW classic rock - done by some of the best that have ever lived.  No one plays like Brian or Roger, and Paul's voice is spot on.  In the liner notes, some of the lyrics read as a bit trite, but (as George Michael implored) 'listen without prejudice' and you will be rewarded.    Finally, a tour is supposed to happen in early 2009.  If you ever liked (not to mention, loved) Queen, you better catch them.  It is something you will not regret.  I'm going to fly whereever they go in the U.S. and then catch them again anywhere they set down in Canuckville.  The magic is in the concert, but the CD is worth the $$$.

If Hollywood would standardize the 3D process with a good system like the 3D expert talked about in another review it would be great and I would gladly pay the $40 for the process.<br /><br />The old movie staring PAT BOONE is far superior to this story.  If I were rating the 2D quality of this movie, I would give it 2 or 2 1/2 STARS.  Other reviewers have provided good reviews on the movie/story so I will only say that I had the impression that the producer/director was rushing to finish the movie and should have added at least 15 min. to the film.

Though his assertion is debatable, Mr. Will's alleged statement highlights the quality of this memoir. The writing and depth of introspection in Mr. Obama's book is admirable. It is a journey about racial identity, spiritual awakening, social responsibilty and a search for the meaning of family. My wife and I are both Caucasian and our two, young sons are African-American. Over the decades, I've read a plethora of books/memoirs pertaining to race and, easily, this is one of the books I will recommend for my boys to read. A truly inspirational and gutsy book.

B00005ASHM|5.0|A couple of weeks ago a guy at my work was playing Endless Summer and It was nice to hear the Beach Boys again. Growing up my dad always played the Boys while working in the garage or while cleaning the house. After listening further I decided to get some of the albums on CD for myself. I talked with my dad first to see if he had them which he does not. He does however have all of the LPs, and I made him swear that they are mine when he passes. I asked him what was his favorite and he told me Pet Sounds. I remember him playing it a bunch as a kid as well as Smiley Smile and a few others. He told me to research this album as the whole world revered this album. Review after review and even Sir Paul's reviews left me thinking this was the pinnacle of pop music. It was even added to the National Recording Registry?! I doubted very much the Beach Boys could do that. I thought they were just surfing and girls and cars. Well, I ordered this album and Smiley Smile and Endless Summer. Locally I picked up a couple of more at the used CD place. When this came my anticipation was off the deep end. I waited until the kids went to bed and popped this in to the player and just relaxed. It played through in mono and then went into stereo. I do not have the words to describe this experience. The closest I have was being a little kid and watching Star Wars for the first time. There is nothing I can add that hasn't already been said. Other then the goofy cover art, this is flawless. Brian Wilson is the rarest of talents. This is that rare album that is timeless. If you haven't listened to this, you have lost.

Of course, not all readers will agree, for various reasons.  Another reviewer suggests skipping the first 50 pages in order to avoid the detailed portrayal of the characters!    And several reviewers are disappointed that we (the USA) are not really presented as the good guys in this story.  We Confederates are quite accustomed to that, of course.    Actually, it can be quite enlightening to see ourselves as others see us.  But, if you'd really rather not, take a cue from that other reviewer's page-skipping suggestion.  The Yank cousins don't really get out of hand until the final ten pages or so.  Withdraw early.  Stay happy.

0385335997|5.0|I first started reading this series a few years ago and highly await the next publication of the series. Written by a very talented Scottsdale, AZ author, Diana Gabaldon; this series of books is for anyone who wants to find a captivating read. The plot starts with a post World War II nurse who is visiting Scotland with her husband and accidentally steps through some stones back in time a few hundred years and how she has to adapt quickly to her surroundings in order to survive. She meets up with a band of Scottish highlanders who take her in and force her into marrying one of their own, the handsome Jamie who protects her from harm and the two end up madly in love. Sounds like a romance novel? Well, it is not. It is researched and written beautifully and you find yourself learning all there is to know about Scotland during this historical time. This novel is for history buffs and well versed readers. This is a series of books that lead us historically through time and place through the eyes of Clare and Jamie. After reading the first book, you will be looking to buy the rest of the series. Hooray for Diana Gabaldon!

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|It took a long time for me to get around to seeing Batman, but thanks to the second-run theater near me, I was finally able to see it.  It was worth the wait.<br /><br />This movie has been reviewed enough to make going over the plot pointless, so instead I'll focus this review on The Dark Knight's symbolism.  In chess, the Dark Knight (Batman, played by Christian Bale) is opposed by the White Knight (Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart).  They are powerful pieces in chess, capable of skipping over other pieces, striking from behind Pawns to attack opponents and then jumping away. In that sense, Knights are somewhat more chaotic than the other pieces; every other piece moves in a linear fashion, but the Knight moves forward and to the side.  Although it may seem to be one of the weaker pieces of chess, when combined with any other piece it is one of the most powerful.<br /><br />In a similar fashion, Harvey Dent and Batman are more powerful because of their pawns.  Dent's pawns include the media, Gordon, and a mostly corrupt police force. For Batman, it's the corporate boards, Gordon, and yes even the police force. Which is the first hint that the simple dichotomy between Batman and Dent isn't quite accurate.  Dent isn't the flipside of Batman, he's the same version with different characteristics illuminated.  Dent is Batman as a civil servant, minus the angst.<br /><br />Batman's true nemesis, the real White Knight, is of course the Joker (Heath Ledger). And now we truly see the opposite of what Batman stands for.  Where Batman is cold, measured, and consistent the Joker is brutal, offensive, and chaotic. And yet they are two sides of the same coin: \\"You crossed the line first, sir,\\" says Alfred, referring to the criminal organizations Batman hunts. \\"You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation. And in their desperation they turned to a man they didn't fully understand.\\" Just like the police turned to Batman. Joker is a criminal form of vigilante justice.<br /><br />If there's an overriding message in The Dark Knight, it's that in a war of escalation, everyone loses.  The ultimate response to the Joker is a massive show of force, a sacrifice of values, and then ultimately a withdrawal from the public.  Superheroes and villains taken to an extreme are basically just terrorists blowing up a neighborhood.  The human cost is too steep for anyone to operate like that out in the open, a lesson the Joker teaches Batman the hard way.<br /><br />Caught in the middle are the victims: Rachel Dawes, Lucius Fox, and Dent's sanity. When Two-Face arrives, it is the cracked mirror of Batman, a hero-turned vigilante who, instead of the Knight that strikes from the shadows, moves in a straight line from one victim to another as judge, jury, and executioner. Two-Face is finally done right in this movie (better than even the cartoon, and that's saying something), and his horrific appearance is so disturbing that my wife felt it pushed the film to an R-rating.<br /><br />The Joker is so unnerving, so malevolent in action, and so utterly amoral in his goal of protecting the Batman-ideal, that Ledger and Nolan have made their indelible mark on the character.  This is the Joker comic book fans always knew from \\"[[ASIN:1563894696 The Long Halloween]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:1401216676 The Killing Joke]].\\" And he's nothing to laugh about.<br /><br />Yes, it's long.  Yes, it's violent.  But ultimately, Nolan's masterpiece is both a meditation on the comic book genre and modern day society.  To stop a terrorist, are we willing to bend every civil liberty, burn down every forest, no matter what the cost? It's a bold, uncompromising vision that will haunt you long after the movie ends.s an overriding message in The Dark Knight, it's that in a war of escalation, everyone loses.
