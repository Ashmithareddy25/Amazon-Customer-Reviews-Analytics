B008K9SG9K|4.0|My son came home telling me all about this cool song he heard and we spent some time tracking it down to the first song on this album. After his curiosity was satisfied on who sang the song and he went on out to the kitchen for a snack, I bought this for him for his upcoming birthday. He was surprised, and after listening to it realized that he had heard other tracks on the album, which made him like it more. All in all... a good purchase.
B005TBN3EU|4.0|If you're looking for a laugh, here's the remedy. Crude, crass, but it makes you feel less stupid and more happy.
145210655X|5.0|Not exceedingly long but I enjoyed all the comics.  Some of them I had to think to get the joke but I love the humor in them.  Bought it for my dad for father's day.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best. I could see anyone not playing this game. If liked the temple runs then u r going to love th his game.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This novel is so much more than a courtroom drama. The look into the life of a family in the midst of crisis leaves the characters and readers questioning and searching for the truth throughout the novel. Allow yourself to empathize with the flawed characters and you are sure to contemplate this story long after you finish the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First off, I absolutely loved the Hunger Games. Suzanne Collins is an absolute genius. I loved the simple yet futuristic living in most of the districts. This was a story of survival of the fittest. One boy and one girl sent to be the sole survivors of the games, which are shown on television. Katniss and Peeta are characters that I absolutely fell in love with. I think this is a book that everyone should read. I can not wait to read book two.
B00422LESO|2.0|The premise of the book is completely whimsical. As it progresses, the novel loses some of the lightness and just is weird. Not only does the main character not know what is real and what is acted/scripted, readers don't either. Since the novel ends up with a forced and dramatic romcom ending, I imagine the movie will be better as the best aspects of this story are the visual settings, not the characters, dialogue, or conflict. Save yourself the time and cash to see it on the big screen.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It is an amazing book by an amazing author. Seeing the journey that Christian and Anastasia go through. I loved the fact that Anastasia was so young and fell head over heels in love with Christian. I loved the journey that they both went through. I think everyone should read this book. It is awesome and super sexy. They sex scenes were amazing and extremely sexy. E.L. James is an amazing and talented author.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love being able to pick up my Kindle to check the weather any time, anywhere.  I haven't had any problems with the app or the amount of information I can get.
0374531269|4.0|This was an great book.  I was really taken back by the brutality of this war.  I am thankful that Ishmael survived and was able to share his story with the world.
0812982622|1.0|The subject matter was too brutal for me to like the book. The narration back and forth got me a little confused sometimes. I had to go back to make sure I hadnt missed anything.<br />I could not recomend the book to anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It took me less then 5 minutes to set up.  And when I say set up I plugged it in and it told me to go to a website.  I went to the website and put in the code that was on my TV.  Then, without any effort on our part both Kindles, three Cellphones and one IPad all had little Icons added to YouTube and Netflix to start a \\"Cast\\" to our TV.  Our kids already knew how to get to Netflix on the kindle and I just showed them where the cast icon was and it went straight to the TV.  Netflix and YouTube both work perfectly.  However, HBOGO while in the chrome browser had some lag and the sound got out of sync.  Of course HBOGO doesn't have the app for it yet so hopefully that comes in the future.<br /><br />AMAZING product.  Were canceling cable..
0385349947|5.0|Enjoyed reading the perspective of a driven, yet successfully balanced woman. Excellent tips and insightful anecdotes provided throughout the book.
B000002LAC|5.0|Dolly may be getting older but she is the heart and soul of country. Trio has her two friends joining her and it doesn't get any better than that. These gal are winners. I loved this CD
B001NAT05W|5.0|Love halle berry. So it was great<br />She was good in the movie. That she was so sweet , she got that cat in her change her as a person..in a good way<br />Like all the supe hero's
B004NS710C|5.0|We liked this movie so much, we ordered one for Dad's birthday and another for ourselves.We received the package sooner than expected.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is just what I needed...a handy, easy to use calculator. I have no idea if it is appropriate for advanced calculations, but for everyday needs, you could not do better!
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|There is some pretty funny and original comedy in this flick and we laughed a lot. Very entertaining! Definitely would go to the movies to see it.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It worked well after a while since my youtube on silk broke  but after a while its now taking forever to load and sometimes just pauses during the video and now that I've tried downloading the videos to try , and watch them  now its hard  and it won't  play all :(
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome. i have made hotels pools,  citys and more. it is just like legos but a thousand times better
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I personally love how this app has every nook and cranny you would need to make a picture seem so perfect
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Game is fun, but I wish I didn't have to search the same scenes so many times. You don't have to use money which is a plus.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|It is impossible for me to understand why this fascinating information did not come to light years ago. The writing was on the wall and much of the data was out there. I guess it took Gladwell's inquisitive mind and his arresting writing style to make it real for the rest of us.<br /><br />IT IS A MUST READ for every thinking person. I can't wait to read his other books.
B000SEI230|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I was totally disappointed by the DVD that was made based on it.  The book was so much more true to real teens in that era.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Really enjoying this game! Definitely worth the download. I love how it encourages you as you play. Easy enough for kids but still fun for adults.
140120841X|5.0|I had to read this comics for my English class. Much better than the movie and it was really fun to read it
140006922X|5.0|This book reads like a novel.  Even though these are stories I've heard most of my life, I kept wanting to \\"see what happens next.\\"<br />I've always felt more kinship with the Jesus who walked the earth than the sterilized Christ figure presented by most Christian religions.  Don't read the book if you are a person who is afraid asking questions will condemn your soul to hell.  But if you want to know more about how our Christian faith came down to us, read it!  Extremely well documented.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I have a kindle fire and I had downloaded this game to try it out and I did and it was awful. It is very hard to maneuver the minion. If they have put a sensitivity level in the options I would have gave this game at least four stars. Also this game looks like it's trying to rip off subway surfers.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I loved this movie, and am so glad I bought it!  It is and will always be one of my favorites!!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|We love the film, Marvel did a good job of melding so many storylines. Plenty of action that one can still watch with kids.
B000SI939S|5.0|I like this book.  Of course, I loved the movie, and appreciate the recipe for fried green tomatoes I found in the book!
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|i really liked this cd..its pretty good..but i dunno who i like more, halestorm, or the letter black? anybody has an opinion on this?
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Everyone should read this book.  It is truly deepest foundational human piece I have ever read.  I wish I had read it years ago. I will read it again.
B00009MECF|4.0|IT'S GOT LORRAINE BRACCO AND I'VE HAD A RAGING CRUSH ON HER FOREVER (SINCE GOODFELLAS DEFINITELY) AND LEO AS A BUDDING STAR. IT WAS AN OK ADAPTATION OF JIM CARROLL'S JOURNAL I SUPPOSE.  IT'S JUST A MUST-HAVE FOR ANY CINEPHILE'S COLLECTION SO I GOT IT.
1881273377|5.0|Great information and very easy to understand. Enjoyed the examples and the section on applying this to your children. Must have!
B00006FDCD|5.0|The movie adaption of this was awesome. I was skeptical because I loved the book but, wow this movie blew me away. The little bit thy changed was tasteful and made sense.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|just needs easier explanations on how to play the thing. Sure do enjoy it thought it's hysterical.. LOVE the minions
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|It's a very fun game but when I don't have WiFi I can't play so if you make it so that it can play with out WiFi I would rate it 5 stars<br /><br />Thank you for your time<br />-MC0nFire
B00000J0O2|1.0|Toner is not new.  It is over 10 years old.  Seller should disclose how old toner is.  Buying for a public school that has a small budget.  Thought I found a good deal, but did not.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|in a day and age where beauty is everything, there can still be wonder.  just read it.<br />then believe that in the possibility of wonder.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Game is fun keeps you busy. I like  it and my daughter likes that it looks like a real horse
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|rare. beautiful. insightful.<br />all in a whimsical, sad, heartbreaking and heart healing story.<br />this is the book that stays with you long after you finish reading.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Thought I had a FREE game....I don't want to buy hearts or what ever they want to sell you...it's a rip off,,
B008XKSW7M|4.0|This movie made me laugh a lot.  It is extremely funny and matches many of the stories that my friends and I have lived through.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I like all his stuff. This is no exception though I think it's easy to see how it grew out of a short story because it lacks the depth that some of his other stuff does. Not that it's shallow or empty just isn't quite as meaty as something like American Gods.
B00000J0O2|5.0|This is a great product.  The price was very reasonable for HP toner.  It measures up to what one would expect of an HP product.
B000F0UUIM|5.0|Love this movie.  John Wayne acts so tough thru most of the movie, but in the end he has a soft side.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book transported me into a different world where all things were possible. I had not read a book that gave me the feelings of fantasy and imagination I experienced as a child in many, many years! I had a hard time putting it down. Beautifully written. I fell in love with the little boy and Lettie almost instantly. I can't remember how the book was recommended to me, but I'm so glad I got the chance to read it.
B00005ASGG|5.0|We love John Wayne movies and these were all in very good condition.  Very pleased. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a very good movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my favorate game. THANK YOU MARKUS NOTCH!!!!!!!!!! But if U R notch...in the next update please put in endermen and enchantment tables
B00027JYLC|5.0|This is a real piece of history with an interesting back story and interesting human beings. A somewhat hokey story but with a good heart as the weak and down trodden win out over the powerful, elite, classists, criminals. The transfer is good and sound is as good as can be expected for an early talkie. I have only a small collection of movies but this was one that I wanted on DVD format to watch again every few years and to be able to show it to people who have never seen it before.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Simply the most personal and honest account of a woman's journey to finding her balance and god. I treasure this book and will share it often.
B00D6QUJ6U|1.0|When ordered this,  I did not read the description thoroughly. It states that this is a SD Blu-ray... What does this mean?  Simply put: Take the SD source material and scale it to 1080... Why even bother when every BD player on market can take the SD source material and scale to 1080. The manufacturer should never even have bothered with this. It is very deceiving and misleading to audio and video enthusiasts. They should be ashamed of these marketing tactics. Very disappointed in the video quality and was expecting a true 1080 experience. It is not to be found with this title.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I hope there are more of these games in the works, I could not stop playing it is that good
B005544TRQ|5.0|Got hooked on to it, highly recommended.<br />Like to see some more court dramas.<br />Probably put in the same category as Boston Legal
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|it was ok, but it was lacking something for me to want to buy the next game, I am not hooked
0689878451|5.0|That's what the story is about really- what makes a family.  The simple answer, which my first-grader pointed out- is \\"love\\". Yes, it's a story about gay parents. So what?  Trust me, at some point in their lives all our children are going to meet someone who's gay and/or someone raised by gay parents.  The book isn't trying to push kids to be LGBT, it's just showing kids that different kinds of families exist.  That's in part why I picked it up for my kids- I want them to understand that not everyone is like us and not every family is like ours, so that when they come accross something or someone different they won't be afraid or a bully.  I also picked it up because it shows an adopted family.  My husband and I have both biological kids and adopted kids and sometimes it's just nice to see an adopted family in a children's book that doesn't then go on to wack you over the head with \\"and it's ok that we look different\\" etc.<br /><br />If nothing else, it's a book that teaches kids not every family is the same.  At best, it might prompt a question or two from your kid about types of families, adoption, or homosexuality.  Which should be a welcome opening for both liberal-minded parents and conservative-ones to talk to their kids.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Engaging...story is fast moving, good character development; you can easily sympathize with Katnis and understand why she does what she does and feels as she feels.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The series has kept me glued waiting for the next episode.  All aspects such as writing, directing, special affects, etc. was done by outstanding professionals.  Hopefully, there will be a fourth season, ASAP.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! It just needs some more stuff. Other than that its still really really really really cool.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have been placing recipes and other note worthy stuff in this program. So far I like it, pretty easy to use.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I is too hard to do I tried it but can not get past the first area.  Do not play it.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Great adventure film, but a little hokey.  Acting could be better. Bruce Willis needed a bigger part.  No one would survive the airplane crash that knocked the wings off.
B00CO6QGCE|3.0|It's totally great for my mixes but all the mixes once they're created starry coming out all choppy and it ruins a great mix
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is very fun ans challenging. I enjoy playing this game every day. I love hidden object games and this is by far one of the best
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love this game! Tons of fun and I'm glad it's free ;) thank you !I would recommend it to anyone who loves card games
B009AJDDQU|4.0|This movie raised almost as many questions as it answered regarding the 'Alien' mythology in my opinion.  It is a solid addition to the 'Alien' franchise but if you're not a fan of those movies it may just come across as pretty sci-fi movie that leaves you wondering why it was made and if there will be a sequel.  Now regarding Amazon's Instant Video delivery: I purchased the HD copy from Amazon and the three times I have watched it, the movie freezes and REBOOTS my Samsung Smart TV at right around the 8:30 mark (when the android David enters the cryo chamber to wake the crew); I have used a wired an wireless connection but it does this every time, so far.  I have other HD movies purchased through Amazon that all play with no problems....yet!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I've had various issues with USB to Serial adapters before causing blue screens on various laptops, both on a previous ASUS Windows 7 laptop, and again on a new Acer Windows 8 laptop for work, with driver issues that I never could resolve.  This one worked perfectly with the drivers included, and I haven't had any of the issues that I did previously.  Highly recommended for anyone that needs a serial port for administering network switches or servers.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I am disappointed that there are so few games in this edition.<br />The good news is that I am able to play the same games over and not remember all the steps.<br />Also I like the reshuffle option.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|These lights work great, bright, easy to use, somewhat durable unless dropped down steps. My kids like using them in their forts that they build with their friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good game and easy to play for little ones. The graphics are also excellent which makes it enjoyable to watch. Would recommend.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved the season, can't wait for next season to begin.  Wish it was starting sooner.  I love watching a whole season without commercials or having to wait in between shows.
B005SAP45I|3.0|We watched it with our two-year-old, who loved Cars 1.  This one relied more on dialogue and pop culture references.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is the best movie ever. Colin Firth is my hero and the most handsome leading man. No other version will be as good as this one.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Urban rain storm is my favorite. I was surprised how much it helps me relax at night. Great app! It really does the trick.
B00439MV42|4.0|Oops! Did I mention there were three of these movies. Hey don't worry, just get all three and enjoy. Thanks.<br /><br />John
B0057URWSQ|5.0|Best new TV series ever!!! We are addicted to it, it is fun, smart, sexy and has great writing!!<br />MUST sEE!!
B003A166OK|5.0|Up to this point in time Joe Kidd was just another American  trying to live a life in privacy.  Kidd was one of those that didn't like to be pushed. He was roped into being used to meet an end. This didn't work out.The law and the bad guys were pushing the wrong guy. You'll have to buy the movie to find out what he does, but you;ll like it. Thanks.<br /><br />John
0316123587|5.0|The yearbook is spectacular,especially for the price. Looking through it makes you feel like you are in the chool with the characters.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|This is  one of those movies where you would like to have a roll of tape and be able to use it, (on a few mouths). These kids are an illustration of the old proverbial parental command  (Stay in your own yard and keep the noise down).  You will wish you had that roll of tape during the whole movie. Thanks.<br /><br />John
0316232955|5.0|The book came in great condition. My daugher has read it twice and it is now on her bookshelf. We will order more soon.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I loved The Kite Runner and had eagerly anticipated reading this book. It started with great promise. I was immediately captivated by Abdullah and Pari. Had that been the only story line the author pursued, I would have been a happy and interested reader. Instead, so many characters and story lines were interjected that I lost track of who was who, who lived where, and who was related to whom. By the time the author wrapped it up, I didn't really care.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|GILLIAN FLYNN GIVES US ANOTHER MASTERPIECE! Just when you think you have it figured out- GREAT twists! Looking forward to her next piece!
0307271080|5.0|As an African immigrant to the United States, I found this book completely relevant to my experiences growing up  in the America. In a comic and creative way Adichie honestly addresses the issue of race in the United States and sheds light on all its complexities. But no book is ever about one thing, beyond the issue of race, this book provides an important perspective on  immigration, love, family and more. It also sheds light on the lives of middle class and upper class Nigerians. Overall, it is a beautifully written and powerful book. I highly recommend it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love this show! It is a must-watch for anyone who is into fantasy and fairy tales- kind of sci-fi. Not only is it very imaginative, but smartly written- not cheesy, always keeps me hooked!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Fascinating look into a great, creative mind I had heard of but knew very little about. I enjoy learning from the experiences of others and this is no exception. Hang in there. It starts pretty slow but then gets really good and moves at a better pace.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|His characters wrap themselves around your heart.  He gives notice to family's strengths and weaknesses, and the foibles of humanity.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|cool watch! It's good with casual outings. I like it a lot. Price isn't  that bad too. Dial is might be little small for those with thick wrist.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game my kids love it!!! They play on a daily basis and talk about how great the game is.
B001AQT11M|5.0|Thank you for getting our Snow White DVD to us so quickly.  My granddaughter has watched it everyday since it arrived!
B00CE27NE8|4.0|The Presidio, directed by Peter Hyams (Timecop, Stay Tuned) introduces us to an unlikely pair of Military Police played by Sean Connery (Dr. No, Highlander) and Mark Harmon (Summer School, NCIS) who must solve a murder at the Presidio, an army base in San Francisco.<br /><br />This review is just for the Blu-Ray and not the movie itself, though it does star Meg Ryan as well, before her terrible plastic surgery face.<br />The movie comes with a theatrical trailer for The Presidio... yeah, that's it. Pretty lame for a new Blu-Ray release.<br />The video quality is superb, superior black levels, film grain is visible, and there is no visible artificial sharpening. A solid and impressive transfer for a mostly ordinary suspense thriller nearly 25 years old. Being that there are basically no supplemental features, Warner/Paramount was able to compress it onto a BD-25 with an average bitrate of 23.95 Mbps.<br /><br />Overall, this film is pretty predictable and formulaic but well done. It's shot exceptionally well as all of Peter Hyams films are, Mark Harmon and Sean Connery have a great chemistry and make for a good pair in this basic buddy cop film. For an older, mostly forgotten film, this is a solid Blu-Ray release. Unfortunately Warner/Paramount didn't feel the same way and included basically no supplemental materials. With the really great transfer, any fan of this film should upgrade from their 1999 DVD release, if the price is right.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I never got to see this... your Network was down.  It would not play it.<br />I should not have to pay for this Movie!!!
B00EIL7IKW|4.0|True Blood Season 6 streets June 3rd, 2014.<br /><br />*Five commentaries with cast and crew including executive producer Brian Buckner, Stephen Moyer, Carrie Preston, Amelia Rose Blaire and more.<br />*Inside the Episodes Featurettes: Learn about the backstories of each episode with revealing interviews from the show writers with ten behind-the-scenes featurettes.<br />*Vamp Camp Files: Get an inside look at the secret trove of documents detailing the effort to eradicate vampires via the institution known as \\"Vamp Camp.\\"<br />*True Blood Lines: Uncover secrets from character relationships past and present in this engaging fully interactive season guide and information archive.<br />*Episode Previews & Recaps<br /><br />Creator (of the show, not the books in which they're based on) and showrunner Alan Ball left True Blood (to helm Cinemax's Banshee, great show) after the fifth season and this worried a lot of fans. While I can say that this show has changed a lot from season 1 to season 6, it has been a natural progression and one that I don't feel was too forced. That being said, I didn't find season 6 as engaging or enthralling as the previous 5 seasons, which is sad because this season puts all of the main characters in the most danger yet. The show is still filled with gore, tons of nudity and some really cool action scenes and one liners that this show has become so popular for. Yet I found myself not being as emotionally invested in these characters as I normally am.<br /><br />Season 6 brings back Anna Camp (Pitch Perfect) as Steve Newlin's estranged wife Sarah, and we have some new characters like Ben Flynn played by Robert Kazinsky (Pacific Rim) and  Nicole Wright played by the beautiful Jurnee Smollett-Bell (Friday Night Lights). But for me I thought Arliss Howard (Wilder Napalm) as Truman Burrell and Rutger Hauer (Bladerunner) as fairy king Niall Brigant were the stand out new additions to the show. As per usual, this is a character driven series but this season all bets are off for who lives and who dies. With tainted True Blood about to hit shelves, most of the main vampires locked up by Governor Burell, Sookie is after Warlow before he gets her, Jason is as confused as ever, and Bill has no idea who he is or what powers he has, or for how long he'll have them.<br /><br />While some characters are dramatically down played from previous seasons (I feel like Sookie and Alcide had the least amount of screen time this season, until the last two episodes) we see a lot of Eric and Pam and Jessica and these new characters which helped make this season feel a bit more fresh, and at the same time a bit distant and stale when compared to previous seasons. Ultimately I think anyone who is a True Blood fan will enjoy season 6, it has some big moments, fills in some blanks from previous season loose ends, and delivers a lot of the things we've come to love from this show. Granted this is probably the weakest season since season 2, I still enjoyed it as much as I ever do. There were some very cool throw-away scenes in the last two episodes that were very reminiscent of season 1 and had a very light hearted feeling to it. And the last 2 episodes were the best of the season. Of course it ends with a cliff hanger to segue nicely into season 7. True Blood isn't for everyone, but for anyone who has been watching this show for the last 5 seasons, you'll be in for some great treats in season 6.season all bets are off for who lives and who dies.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|The overall plot hept your attention through the entire three book series with love, sex, deception, chase, capture and intreague.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|The effects, storyline, and acting are quite good. This story is original and interesting and is worth watching. Not your everyday silly horror movie with terrible plot lines and acting. My household is very picky and we really liked it!
6305433909|5.0|Great movie for those who like feel good movies. Good for children and adults. Music is wonderful, especially &#34;O Happy Day&#34; and &#34;Joyful Joyful&#34;.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|This is one of the best soundtracks in years to come out. Fergie, Will i.am, Jay Z, Florence and the Machine just to name a few.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm is great! I love the setting features! Not one time has this app failed! Very happy and always on time!
B004LROUNG|3.0|This book follows an ex big firm lawyer after he decides to try it out in a small rag tag firm. This book was a little unusual in that the protagonists are not that lovable. It is a mass tort case against a pharma company, but it didn't seem to have enough action or intrigue or any of the typical elements of a crime thriller. I was expecting a little more of a page-turner. Actually, the side-stories about a child who ingests toxic chemicals from a toy and a wage and hour class action are more interesting. The book did have a lot of good descriptions of litigation strategy and courtroom drama if you are interested in that kind of thing.

B004KZOXJA|5.0|Have you ever thought, for the slightest second, have you wished even, that you could be cured of love and live happily without it? For Lena, that is her world. Reminiscent of Matched by Ally Condie, Delirium is a futuristic world where love is outlawed. Lena lives in a future where love is a mental disorder. Amor deliria nervosa. And when people turn eighteen, they get cured once and for all and they never get infected again. Lena counts down the days to get cured. She longs for her life to start. For happiness. And then, as the count down progresses, she does a thing she never thought she was capable of. She falls in love!<br /><br />Oliver is a wordsmith of poetic imagery and emotion. Her carefully crafted chapters are a breeze to sweep by, but also impactful and suspenseful  that it is almost unbearable to put down. Every chapter begins with a passage which is as artfully crafted as the story and the world it is set on. The characters take a life of their own. The story feels like a tragedy waiting to happen. The protagonists, the limelight of a Romeo and Juliet incarnation of loss and love of the modern times.<br /><br />Lena starts off as the advocate for the cure and as eager as any teenager her age is to get treated. But for the revolution to start, it has to start inside, in the mind. For the revolution to start inside someone or something has to challenge your beliefs. That's what happens when Lena meets Alex. She starts to question the world she has been born and raised into. For the brain to awake and see clearly, something has to spring it and alarm it. Alex is the perfect vessel of change. However, he not only cultivates the revolution in Lena's spirit, but also becomes the first love, the first crush. The one who opens your eyes into a world of feelings and foreign sensations.<br /><br />The prose is full of similes and metaphors, imagery and vivid pictures it reads like a poem. Written in the first person, it's self reflective, self-absorbed. The reader is let in on a seamless stream of consciousness narrative where they take the chance to really see what goes on inside the brain of this confused girl, how it thinks, associates and disassociates and the important thought processes that lead to change.<br /><br />The plot is simple, but not uneventful; that's for sure. For its synopsis you would think it would be very futuristic and dystopian. On the contrary, it is as realistic as any of the classics. It is about ordinary people in extraordinary conditions. It runs smoothly moment by moment, second by second, as the change and the shift in focus take place, take shape and form. Every chapter leaves you wanting more. It's never enough. The reader is made to want, need even, another peak (because it feels voyeuristic, as if you're a pipping-Tom in someone's else life) into a moment of their time. That takes skill and lots of brains to master as a writer.<br /><br />Something that made me think about the concept however, is the use of the word love. You'd think if love was outlawed the verb and noun would also be rejected and banned from use. Yet Lena loves running, loves summer. Loves things. So wouldn't loving objects be risky? If you still loved things what could stop you from loving people?<br /><br />On a more personal note, I was reading some other reviews and read about the book being all anti-feminist because it needs a man, Alex, to bring about the sense of fulfilment in the female protagonist, Lena. I want to disagree to the ends of the Earth with that. Opposite-sex relations are constricted with power politics. It's inevitable. But let's not forget that love is the same no matter who you are. It just so happens that the protagonist here is a young woman who falls for a guy, who happens to awaken her senses and her awareness of the world. When you fall in love in real life, you don't care about such dynamics between the sexes. You don't think about them. This happens in academic researches. When you fallin love you are you. You're not a woman, not a man. You're yourself. I think the book would read the same if Lena was a male character or if Alex was female and the relationship was a same-sex one. We've learnt to throw feminism into every literature where there is a woman protagonist and see if it is fit for the feminist, girl-power canon. Let's just remember that sometimes you are a woman who is a female who needs saving and sometimes you're a woman who is female and saves others. Nothing is black and white. Besides no girl actually attempts to kill herself because she was damped for her \\"own good\\" (Twilight hint).<br /><br />If you want something to bite down to your core and bring about thoughts and scepticism about what it means to live without love, then give this book a definite read. And then maybe you'll want to read the second in the trilogy as bad as I want to right now.

0143122843|4.0|Noir is dark by definition, but Bernie Gunther is at his gloomiest in Prague Fatale.  He's coping with the ugly events that marked him in earlier novels.  It is 1941 and Bernie is back in Berlin.  After harrowing experiences in Belorussia, feeling that he is merely \\"a blur\\" of the man he once was, Bernie entertains thoughts of suicide.  When he looks at the mangled body of a man hit by a train, he sees himself.  He is inspired to live only by the knowledge that so many Jews with so much less have soldiered on.<br /><br />The mangled body is that of Geert Vranken, who came to Germany from Holland in search of employment.  That his death was neither an accident nor suicide is clear from the multiple stab wounds that cover his torso.  Bernie makes little progress in the death investigation until he saves a beautiful woman named Arianne Tauber from a mugging.  Arianne eventually tells Bernie an intriguing story about an envelope she was hired to deliver that has now gone missing.  The information causes Bernie to investigate the death of a Czech spy before he is summoned to Prague by General Heydrich, in whose pocket Bernie unwillingly resides.  At that point Prague Fatale turns into a locked room murder mystery, giving Bernie a chance to exercise his considerable detective skills.<br /><br />Because Prague Fatale is a murder mystery linked with a spy mystery, the plot is even more intricate than is common in the Bernie Gunther novels.  The mystery's resolution isn't entirely unexpected but the setup is clever.  A plot twist at the end is too often foreshadowed to be truly surprising, but it is nonetheless satisfying.  A final twist seemed to be tacked on as an afterthought.  The Nazi intolerance of (and hypocrisy toward) homosexuality is one of the novel's better themes, given that gay men are among the forgotten victims of Nazi tyranny.<br /><br />By now, Bernie Gunther fans are so used to the character that his understandably bitter complaints about his life are taking on a broken record quality.  He gives voice to his fears of what the Nazis are doing to him, and to Germany, so often that it becomes a numbing mantra.  Prague Fatale would have been a tighter novel without the frequent repetition of Bernie's angst.  Still, that's a relatively minor quibble.  Bernie Gunther is who he is (as he often tells us), and that's what makes these novels so absorbing.  I would give Prague Fatale 4 1/2 stars if I could.ng on a broken record quality.

The Secret Keeper provides sheer enjoyment and drama, with involvement in the lives of this fascinating family, particularly the strength of an amazing mother, her daughters and very different son. Brings the realisation of how much we could learn from the pasts of our parents and grandparents, often involving the effect of two world wars.  A great read, and the English language is alive and well with Kate's ability to bring people and places real. Can't put her books down, often reading into the night, lost until her next book is available - on my shopping list!<br /><br />Maggie R.

I don't know how Damian manages to tell such a detailed story on some superb characters everything you could think of to describe he does in brilliant detail.<br />Finally the action is by far one of the best I've read in books it can be hard as i know i'm a writer myself to convey a good fight/action scene yet he does it brilliantly in this book, i look forwards to reading even more of Damian's books as soon as i get the chance too seriously buy this book!

B009G78EE2|5.0|I like this CD, and some of the tracks will become classic.  However, Macklemore is not the savior of rap.  He knows that somehow most of his reviewers don't. Rap does not need him; he is just bringing a new sound. If the only CD's you own is Eminem, the Beasties, and Vanilla Ice you are not a real hip hop fan.  Additionally, you do all the other artist an injustice.  Rap has room for diversity.  Yesterday I was listening to some German rap artist some of it was actually good but they no way transform the entire industry.  TuPac raped what he knew at the time, Ice cube and Ice T did as well.  It is not fair in retrospect to say what they were rapping was wrong.  That is like re-doing a Miles Davis classic.<br />There is room for Macklemore and artist such as Eminem even though he lost me a long time ago.  I'm ok with you comparing Macklemore to Eminem, Haystack, Vanilla Ice, the Beastie boys, Kid Rock, 3rd base, Insane Clowns.  Let Pac the GOAT rest in peace.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|If you haven't been keeping up on Van Morrison's new albums, he has a game plan that works. Mix together up-tempo, soul-infused rock songs with pensive, Celtic-styled tunes, toss in some blues rock and you have an album. Add to it some great hooks, spontaneous vocals and a tight band and the albums are interchangeable. The catch? They are all great, including &#34;Born to Sing.&#34; Gush over &#34;Open the Door (To Your Heart),&#34; &#34;Close Enough for Jazz&#34; and &#34;End of the Rainbow.&#34; Check out the samples and see what I mean.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Bought this because I knew and liked about 4 songs.  Listened to it all and there are another 2 or 3 songs that are great too, and 1 or 2 more that are worth listening to often.  Great band, great album!

B00EEXST2K|3.0|In 1972, Linda Boreman, better known to the world by her stage name, Linda Lovelace, took the adult film industry by storm as the first adult film actress to hit the mainstream.  Even though she only spent 17 days in the industry, she still became an overnight sensation, earning so much attention that she also appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.  However, her most notable contributions came long after her career was over, writing several best-selling autobiographies, including Out of Bondage and Ordeal - both chronicling her life and the events leading up to her brief adult film career.  In the years that followed her brief stint, she become a spokesperson for the anti-pornography movement, and traveled across the United States giving lectures, speaking out against pornography and spousal abuse.  The events of her life are the bases for the new bio-picture, Lovelace.<br /><br />Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, the writers and directors of the bio-picture, Howl, both write and direct Lovelace, starring Amanda Seyfried as Linda Lovelace.  Based on a true story, the film begins with Linda living at home with her parents, Dorothy (Sharon Stone) and John (Robert Patrick).  Still a young and impressionable woman, Linda meets Chuck Traynor (Peter Sarsgaard), a bar owner deep in debt that she eventually marries, and whom also persuades her to start a career in the profitable adult film industry.  After her adult film debut becomes a massive success, she decides she wants nothing to do with the pornography industry, as this film depicts the events that took place before, during and after the release of one of the highest-grossing pornographic films of all-time.  Juno Temple, Adam Brody, James Franco, and Hank Azaria also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />There's no doubt the story of Linda Lovelace is a series sad and unsettling events - assuming things went as depicted in her books and in this film.  However, this film tells a story that paints Linda Lovelace as a completely innocent bystander, which is difficult to believe and even harder to relate to.  At no point over the course of this film will viewers look at the main character of this film and believe for one second that she was forced into a life of (apparent) sexual slavery.  There have been plenty of individuals and news stories over the years that have disputed Linda's version of these events, painting her as anything but a tragic figure.  Clearly, it's difficult to conceive that she was completely unwilling to partake in the events that thrust her into the spotlight.  While this information may not have anything to do with this film, it does share a great deal of intel about the person writers and directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman wanted Linda Lovelace to be portrayed as over the course of this film.<br /><br />Outside of the questionable events, Lovelace is a quality bio-picture, which manages to tell an interesting story about a young woman that received an abnormal amount of attention.  Amanda Seyfried's performance as Linda Lovelace is above average, yet severely lacks the emotion of someone that is supposedly being forced to do something against her will.  The evolution of this character is apparently in the cracks as this film jumps from year to year on a whim.  Lovelace's first husband, Chuck Traynor, is captured as a much more believable and emotional figure than Lovelace herself.  Traynor, portrayed by Peter Sarsgaard, is a far more interesting character, filled with anger, rage, and greed.  Although his actions are deplorable in this film, he was clearly in-touch with the adult film industry, managing Lovelace and later Marilyn Chambers - who many call the second biggest porn star of the period.<br /><br />Lovelace features an ensemble cast, most notably Sharon Stone as Linda Lovelace's mother, Dorothy.  Stone is basically impossible to recognize (unless you already knew it was her) as the strict, unforgiving mother that could have easily helped Linda, yet decided to turn her back.  Other noteworthy performances come from James Franco, who makes a brief appearance as Hugh Hefner.  The Playboy mogul also apparently had a pulse on the adult film industry, and quickly took a liking to Linda Lovelace and eventually had her posing for his magazine.  And, while the cast is rounded out by a handful of familiar faces, including Robert Patrick, Juno Temple, and Hank Azaria, the most amusing and entertaining portrayal of this group comes from the former star of The O.C., Adam Brody - who does his best impression of the fructuous adult film performer, Harry Reems.<br /><br />Overall, Lovelace manages to pull-off a believable 70s flick, reminiscent of a films, including Boogie Nights and 54.  Like much of that era, Lovelace incorporates the \\"sexual revolution,\\" mixed with drugs and individual exploration.  Unfortunately, bio-picture films have a way of telling a one-sided depiction of real life events, and while Linda Lovelace did make a career of speaking out against the adult film industry, she was a willing partaker in her 17 days of poor decision-making.  The odds of most movie-goers finding any sort of enjoyable substance in this film is negligible, meaning this film will hardly garner anyone's attention - outside of current porn stars and people familiar with Linda Lovelace.  Yes, the acting is enjoyable to an extent.  However, the story is not.  Odds are this film will turn out to be nothing more than a desperate rental for a small few, while its potential for being a future (and severely edited) Lifetime flick is great.<br /><br />GRADE:  C+<br />FNDNreview.comasily helped Linda, yet decided to turn her back.

B0068TL23G|2.0|Game was very enjoyable at first. I had worked my way up through Chapter 4 as installed on my Samsung Android MP3 player. I recently installed it on my Kindle Fire HD, but I had problems with it on the Fire, so I uninstalled it. Then I started getting an error message on my Samsung, and was instructed to reinstall it from the Amazon app store. After re-installation, it now has annoying music and won't allow play unless there is an Internet connection. I couldn't find a website to give feedback to the developers. I think I got this app for free as Amazon app of the day; I would be willing to pay for a music-free, offline-playable version, but I uninstalled the present version, and will not be installing it again until there is a music-free version that does not require Internet connection to play it.

B00BVYNSLC|5.0|I highly recommend this TV Show.<br /><br />Although it lacks the witty Joss Whedon dialogue, this is the TV show that Dollhouse was trying to be and failed. This show is a collaboration between Canadian and American productions and the majority of the show takes place in Ontario, which I only figured out by paying attention to the license plates of vehicles. To really pull off a show like this you need two things, a very good lead actress and very good writing. Season one delivers both.<br /><br />Tatiana Maslany is previously unheard of by me but she has done an impressive job in this first season and it made me wonder where this lady has been hiding. Her ability to switch between different clone personalities is amazing. Never once did I feel that one clone felt like another with her remarkable performance. Her body language, demeanor and manner of speech change with each clone she has to pretend to be. Which, to me, seems quite a challenge for just one production but one she handles quite capably. I think what struck me the best is how she handles pretending to be one person while pretending to be another. I speak about her the most because she carries the show, but luckily the supporting acting is also equally wonderful. Except for her, suddenly new, boyfriend, Paul. His is the only performance where I kind of found it to be wooden. He seems more male model than actor but time can prove that differently (I guess you ladies might like him).<br /><br />The writing in this show is really quite good. It’s also very clever, with the way it is written as Sarah finds out things so does the audience. It feels natural in its progression and doesn’t feel like any of the plot points are too forced. There are definitely twists and turns in the show and each character feels like a real person with baggage. Even though this is on the fringe side of science, the writing brings it to plausible territory very well and you find yourself accepting the premise of the show quite easily. Or at least, I did.<br /><br />This is one show I feel you should take time from your day to give it a watch. You won’t regret it.e easily.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I purchased this version after seeing the original many years ago and it still blows my mind how animation has developed into such an art form based off of a fantastic video game. The extra footage and features on the Blu-Ray were amazing to say the least and it's a tremendous adventure for anyone who is a fan of the game, animation, music, and drama. It can be a little difficult to follow if you're not familiar with the game or story at all but it will be a movie for many people to come back to years later just on the special effects alone. A must have.

140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan's book, &#34;Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth&#34; is eye-opening. The book is a well-researched, fully-documented scholarly work. Modern-day Christians believe in a character (concocted by a man named Paul) who is nothing like the historical man from Nazareth named Jesus. As the author concludes, that's a shame because that man, the real man, the revolutionary who stood up against Rome, the wealthy, the powerful on behalf of the poor and weak is someone worthy of believing in. Read it.

0143122916|5.0|HOrrifying and moving story. It is well recounted with occasional empathy gaps as one might expect from a person who has been raised in such a prison/torture system. It's a great companion text to The Orphan Master's Son.

034580709X|3.0|This mystery was unique.  I'll say this for the author, the author made sure that no character in the book, including the main character Harry were without flaws.  Each character had quite a few including Harry who was a recovering alcoholic when the book began.  The problem I had and I know this was only a work of fiction but I can't help it; any book or film I watch that includes hitting, kicking an animal of any variety gets me upset.  I'll admit it that I'm a very passionate animal lover and even in books it shouldn't be used to kick a dog.  That's all the spoiling of the story I'll do except for the ending where there was a very large question mark left.  I don't know if the next book picks up where this one left off and you find out what happened to this person but I find it very frustrating when a book ends this way.

B006OFN0SE|4.0|This was an interesting movie on Hoover.  I get the feeling with other information about Hoover, that Clint Eastwood was 'kind to' or 'benevolently respectful' on the subject of Hoover as a person.  Having a lot of admiration for Clint Eastwood, so, this doesn't effect my rating.  DiCaprio is impressive and intense in the role of Hoover. DiCaprio has really matured as an actor, and is believable in this role.<br /><br />I think for a deeper insight into Hoover, you would have to watch other available documentaries.  You know that Eastwood touches on some of Hoovers 'darker? sides' but mostly in a 'vague' manner.  I enjoyed this movie and it gave me insight into that time in history which I do not know very much about.  One of the reasons i decided to watch this.

B003U6BE8I|2.0|I expect a movie to be different from the book, but this one took to many liberties.  They left major characters out of the story.  They changed the plot and motives of main characters.  I don't think any of the changes they made added to the story at all.

All this matters for me and I guess for all those people who reached \\"30th, 40th, 50th year barrier\\" and<br />feel they should change a lot in their life.<br /><br />Easy to read this book especially taking into account I'm not native English speaker.

B00B04NJI0|1.0|My boyfriend and I settled down for what we thought would be some sort of kitschy short flicks, perhaps just cinematically cool looking if the story lines weren't all that great. What we got was a gore-fest. Which would probably normally be fine in context, in a longer movie for example, but it was just gore-y short after gore-y short and it was just an onslaught that I couldn't take to the point of it making me nauseated. Definitely not for the faint of heart or even for those that are generally okay with some gore (like myself), but this was probably just overkill to watch all at once. Ye be warned!

B007VUCAVO|5.0|Because smart phones are heavy battery drainers, I needed an app which showed the visual status of my battery. This one does the trick. It shows the amount of battery remaining, whether or not the battery is charging, and estimated life left for various apps.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I purchased this item to connect my Kindle Fire to a Kindle fast charger. The mini USB end plugged into the Kindle, and the normal size USB plugged into the fast charger, which, in itself, plugged into a surge protector. The charging time with this adapter was fast: less than 45 minutes for a full charge from a dead Kindle. Purchased along with the other essential item, the fast charger. I can wholeheartedly recommend this product.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|For .99 cents you can not beat this app. I may be biased though, as this is the only alarm clock app I've ever used. The overall display is well done and looks great. With a few different choices for the main screen and the slide dimmer effect, it works great as a stand up table side clock. Alarm is easy to use and the sleep feature with the white noise is used by me more than I initially thought it would be. Overall great buy.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a fantastic book based on data and is something virtually everyone should read. It will change the way you eat if you care about your health and how you feel. Loved it!
0670026638|5.0|Let's begin with the bottom line: I recommend this book very strongly. The novel intertwines two stories. One is the story of Ruth (formerly from Manhattan) and her husband who live on a remote island off the coast of British Columbia. Their marriage and the descriptions of the island life and community are engaging. The other story is told through a diary written in Japanese by a young Japanese girl and French letters found in a sealed Hello Kitty lunch box on the beach in Canada. The diary is also a story worthy in its own right. Ms. Ozeki does a fine job of weaving the stories together. But, to be totally frank, Jiko makes everything work. When the 104 year old Buddhist nun is on scene, everything sparkles and it becomes difficult to stop reading. This is a novel filled with details that are important. The details add character, interest and veracity. (In some novels, details just make them ponderous.) For example, the diary is written in a copy of A la recherché du temps perdu by Proust where blank pages have been substituted for the original text.  This detail both fits with the recurring theme of time and time being and tells us something about Nao, the diarist. (Other little details I loved: A meetings, the free store, that Jiko texts, the cat, and the surprising insights from Ruth's husband.) The novel is not lengthy, but I did not find it to be a quick read. Perhaps that is because there are two stories to follow and perhaps it just because, Ms. Ozeki has given us much to ponder and observe.  This is a novel that manages to intertwine tenets of Buddhism, the life and death of a kamikaze pilot, suicide, terribly painful bullying, frustrations with internet service, Alzheimer's, botany, ecological issues, morality of modern warfare issues, computer programming details, cultural clashes, marriage, family, and love. Summarized like that in a necessarily incomplete list, it would seem like impossible nonsense to attempt.  But, Ms. Ozeki succeeds brilliantly. Mybook group has been meeting for almost 25 years. A Tale for the Time Being is the rare kind of book that could be a book group selection for us because there is so much to talk about. It was a good use of time and money in comparison to the entertainment value. I will be recommending it to our group. The only negative: I cannot abide footnotes in novels. There are multiple footnotes in this novel that Ms. Ozeki primarily uses to translate or provide translation style information about cultural details in the Japanese culture. These footnotes made it difficult at first for me to become engaged in the story. Some are helpful and some are unnecessary (like the Ginko explanation). The fact that I was able to get past this very entrenched prejudice is a tribute to Ms. Ozeki's skill. But, next time, I would prefer that she do without footnotes.
B004AGI2L4|4.0|Michael Fassbender really gets his (perfect) teeth into this role as a centurion caught in a battle with the Pictish inhabitants in the far north of what was the Roman Empire in 117AD. The real stars of the show are the Scottish countryside and what I believe to be the woods around Buckinghamshire, not far from London. You can die of hypothermia just looking at some of the shots of the Highlands. This is a gore fest of the first magnitude, like Warlords with Jet Li in terms of sheer splatter of blood and brains. Dominic West has a short but telling role in the movie and David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham are first rate. Talked about scarred old soldiers.  Great. JJ Feild does not get to do much, but what he does is important.  The female tracker Etain looks like a young Catherine Zeta-Jones, especially with the woad on.  It is not historically accurate and their Scots Gaelic dialect needs work, plus that is not likely to be what the Picts would have spoken; we have very few records of their language. But for a rolicking adventure with excellent music, scenery and a life and death struggle, there are many worse ways to spend a couple of hours. The ending had a few twists, and left me hoping for a sequel.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|the old stars even make fun of their older moves,sayings they are known for.  good action, great fun. i will watch it again.
B007FXLZ9K|1.0|I kept waiting for the movie to pick up and some of the torture to be over, but it is unrelentingly gloomy. Props to Michael Fassbender, a fantastic actor with such sameness to work with. I got tired of long shots of nothing happening, with not even any score to help the unrelenting dullness. There was nothing sexy about this movie at all. It is a shame that the brother and sister do not actually confront the issue of his acting out, just confront each other about an untidy apartment.  A really wasted opportunity that made some really talented actors just seem like they were waiting for a train to take them somewhere. Which they did in the film, a lot!  Cpmpletely depressing on every level.

B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Expect no adjectives like gritty, edgy, or fast-paced here. This is crime drama stripped of the usual cliches that plague so many American productions. The look and feel of this takes me back to the very premiere of &#34;Prime Suspect&#34; in that it presents a trudge through a mundane English coastal town whose social rug is pulled out from under it by an unthinkable act. The local officer compromised by her proximity to the natives with whom she is closely involved, is forced to surrender jurisdiction to a tormented yet determined veteran. Ambitious reporters descend on the town as the press gets word. There is no real list of suspects to be had, only suspicions that gnaw and drive the town to paranoia. This is one of those rare mysteries that is paced like a good book. Highly recommended!

If this where a free to play game i would be happy to pay but this game cost 7 dollars and its just a mobile game.<br />  The main problem wasn't evan paying for every bit of clothing your character buys, Nooo thats the least of my worry. The worst part is the combat. It takes forever to use and you start of incredibly weak and and can pay money to get better.<br /><br />  Ps. Dont. Buy
078322799X|4.0|I find most of the National Lampoon movies outside of the American Pie's to be really sophomoric but watchable. This one is not all that funny although it has it's moments, but it is a lot better written and acted than their usual. There are some sophomoric jokes and pranks but the main focus is on a college boy (Adam) and a virgin college girl (Eve) who start dating. As the physical intimacy ramps up she always stops him before there is a home run. They do progress to where she only has panties on in one scene but he still can't slide home. After over nine months of whacking it he gets drunk one night and wakes up with a naked girl named Patty in his bed. He starts to pee with pain, goes to the doctor, finds out it is a urinary infection. Meanwhile Eve has been talking with a fellow sister who is also a sister and she decides to finally go all the way with Adam. Eve goes to his room to do the deed and Adam refuses to have sex because he has not yet found out he does not have an STD. She finds out about his indiscretion and gets rather upset. They stay apart for an unspecified time during which Adam finds out about his infection and that he and Patty did not actually do the dirty deed. After more chats with Sarah Eve finally figures out she can forgive Adam and goes over and gee they Git-R-Done. I found this movie to be a cut above most college dating movies in the way the whole relationship between Adam and Eve is handled. Sure Adam gets horny as hell from the cuddling and spit swapping but will only abuse himself and is willing to wait for Eve to decide when the time is right. Until the Patty event and then even drunk on his ass he wouldn't do more than sleep with her not \\"sleep\\" with her. Anyway everything seems to end well.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time...oh this was a documentary???  I didn't notice because I was so engrossed in the story being told.  It may have something to do with the fact that it was partly my story they were telling.  If you grew up through the late 70's and 80's then it's your story too.  Watch it. It rocks!

B007ZXK08C|3.0|This is a book which I find difficult to make my mind up about.  It was very slow to start and it was about half way through before it began to pick up speed and interest me. There are two main characters in the book and I'm afraid I couldn't entirely believe in either of them.  Nick struck me as a bit wet.  For someone in the position of having been a successful man, he seems to lose his way entirely after losing his job.  Amy, duplicitous Amy - maybe such a person could exist - but I doubt it.  It was a step too far for me.  I could see how her upbringing and the strange relationship with her parents could be damaging but without giving the game away, I can't explain what I found so unconvincing about her.<br /><br />The writing was crisp and engaging and I wish the story had been a little more convincing.  To me, it was an over-egged pudding.  I read this for my local book group and on the whole enjoyed the experience.  I felt the ending was rather nothing.  Pity.

B007B6VOG0|5.0|I enjoy most every on this album waaaayyy more than I expected.  Their radio releases are good, but the rest of the album is even better, which is not a common opinion of mine.  The first track placed me in the setting of the opening scene of a Broadway show; if that's what they were going for, then they nailed it.  Try to give it a listen with your eyes closed!  Very much recommend!
630542828X|5.0|This movie is well-cast with John Travolta as a slick ambulance-chasing lawyer who reluctantly investigates a liability case after being publicly shamed on a radio show.  He is drawn deeper into the case when he picks up the scent of big money, and finds his moral compass once he gets to know some of the victims he represents.  His pursuit ultimately reveals bigger fish - multinational corporations, to fry; however these corporations have legal departments and access to legal &#34;specialists&#34; whose size and resources quickly dwarf Travolta's firm, which had seemed more than adequate for the case at the start of the movie.  Suspense builds as the stakes go higher in this great David v Goliath courtroom thriller.  Travolta's chilling recital of the calculus of liability laws at the beginning o this movie is worth the price of admission all by itself.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|Another one of those albums that is better than expected.  The greater majority of the tracks are great, some better than their radio releases!

B004HWYTP4|4.0|That in 2013 RED 2 is being released pretty much sums up my thoughts of this film.  Where the premise is about retired government assassins being hunted down and joining together to protect each other, themselves had me thinking this was going to be some extreme action flick, particularly with Bruce Willis as one of its stars.  Instead it was one of the funnier films I've seen Willis in and his co-stars, all of whom I expect for more dramatic roles, made it even more pleasant:  Helen Mirren (adore her work), Morgan Freeman (plays God often enough, he must be a close friend and still can give us the drama and the laughs he did much earlier in his career), John Malcovich.  The name alone tells you you're going to get a great performance from a great actor.  Here he plays the \\"off\\" a little character, again, but unforgettably.  And refreshing to the cast is Mary-Louise Parker.  Caught up in the adventure by being in the right place at the wrong time.  Sure, there's action, but there's award winners \\"playing\\" as much as working and I found the film a complete delight.  I look forward to actually seeing its sequel, and I'm not a huge fan of sequels (exception may be the Willis Die Hard series of films).

B005ZOBNOI|2.0|Review may have spoiler. I didn't become very invested emotionally with the characters.  Teens with Cancer - you'd think that would emotionally connect.  Did not enjoy the swearing and the fact that it portrayed teens having sex.  I saw so many great reviews of the book I expected to love it.  Even my nieces enjoyed it.  And in truth, it wasn't a terrible book (as I did finish it).  I was thinking of doing it for a book club book, but it just wasn't good enough for me.  Just my preference.

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|this is a fun game that is not memorizable so there is always a little bit of a challenge...woop woop
B00499NHLC|5.0|This series is fantastic. We are hooked. Every episode is a treat to watch. Engaging, suspenseful, intelligent story telling. LOVE IT!
B009PAETCG|5.0|You can let your five year old kids because you can go to kid mode!You can go to normal mode for a normal game.
B002O2THRO|5.0|I loved watching this with my daughter, who just read the book. &#34;Who is that man,&#34; she said, &#34;He is attractive!&#34;  Indeed, dear child, he is the definition of attractive.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to set alarms in no time, everything shows you don't have to search out each function to set alarms .good selection of clock faces. All in all a very good product.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Every page in this book has a purpose. There is no filler. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading.
B000PHVZNE|5.0|This is definitely an entertaining movie. It actually makes you think how you would survive if you were isolated on an island. Tom did a great job acting. It was all about him, very little other actors were introduced until the end of the movie. Superb movie, I loved it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Absorbing story. Interesting twist. Good insight into the effects of mistreatment in institutions. A reminder that children grow up and some live to tell their story.
0783116934|4.0|I would recommend this movie. It was well made, graphic and accurate. Donald Sutherland was great in his role, as we're the other actors. This is a true story.
B00873GRU4|5.0|very enjoyable book and already started the next one why do i have to have twenty words never rating a book againand
630542845X|5.0|This movie was entertaining. The actors were very good. I bought this for my husband (who through the years has enjoyed this movie) because we had the VHS and in replacing with DVDs it was a must.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This is a well-packaged DVD at a good price. If you haven't seen the other movies, you miss the significance of J's and K's relationship in this one but its still an enjoyable film. It also shipped very quickly and ahead of Amazon's timeline.
B000ICXQOM|1.0|How can anyone review this junk so highly...wasted my money, don't waste yours..<br />Tricked some wannabe producer to budget this dump.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story itself is great and highly enjoyable, but the style needs a bit of help. I found myself focusing on Flynn's phases with certain words- words that the characters would each use 4 times in 10 pages, then we would never see them again. Also, the language and tone could use some beefing up, but otherwise a good read.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A story that will capture you from the first paragraph. It is well written, the characters are fascinating and the story will warm your heart and break it at the same time. You will not want it to end.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My son favorite Dr Panda apps are the daycare, Handyman, and The Supermarket!  He loves them all! Thanks for these cute apps!
B005BZQTGS|3.0|This is what you would expect from a Danny McBride/James Franco movie (of which I am usually a fan).  I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.  If you're in the mood for a laugh and enjoy the humor of McBride / Franco (ala This Is The End) then you will like this movie.  It's funny.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Too many big stars in one dimension roles and references to unrelated older movies that the actors have done. This could have been a good movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|one of the best google product designed.<br />love it, small, user-friendly, easy to setup.<br />two issues i can see...one you need a very stable WiFi connection especially for video streaming.<br />two it's you require to power the device either via your TV USB port if you have one if not, you have to have use the AC adapter with the USB cable to power it.<br />other than those minor issues, this device it's probably one of the few must have items at home!
1452000247|5.0|Peter: A Darkened Fairytale grabs the reader in the opening sentences and pulls them into a world that most imaginations wouldn't be able to conjure. It is the story of a young boy that finds himself on an unexpected journey, striving to save a Shylong and protect a civilization he didn't know existed. Along the way he meets with ageless friends, elves, dragons, murderous sisters, cannibalistic fairies and a host of other magical creations.<br /><br />Two things really stand out in the story. The first is the protagonist, a young, unassuming boy that finds he possesses courage and understanding far greater than he ever realized. He is a regular man young man that the reader can readily identify with thrust into the most bizarre of situations, armed with the advice of friends, a few trinkets tucked away in his satchel, and a firm sense of right and wrong.<br /><br />The second is the exquisite job the author does with his attention to detail. Characters aren't simply mentioned, they are depicted for the reader. Every scene is painted vividly, the reader able to fully envision the action as it unfolds.<br /><br />This was a captivating read from start to finish, strongly recommended for audiences well beyond the middle-grade years.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love everything Khaled Hosseini writes. His books are so moving and his words stay with you. One of my favorites.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Thank you VERY much as this product works extremely well! I couldn't be any more happier than I already am with it!
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|it s like Irish mario! fantastic! I think I'll be playing this one for a while! little lep is cute!
157421327X|5.0|These are the first books I bought for learning how to zentangle with my kids for a creative outlet.  Absolutely love these books - lots of ideas and designs to choose from!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really had fun playing this interesting game!  I can't wait for more levels to be made for this game!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The kids watched the preview and decided to watch the movie.  It is one of their favorites.  Can't wait to watch the new one!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Just what I was looking for...a comical good hearted romance with some of that angst and steamy scenes we crave. I caught myself laughing out loud many times from this Male point of view....even read some of it to my husband who agreed on the point of views. Although there were scenes where I could just scream at the main character's nerve and cockiness  I did understand his POV (a little, I admit).  Great read. Will definitely be looking for more from this author.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is an awesome game and it is very fun for kids who like sharks like me and it has the giant megalodon
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|4stars because the tracks are a little lame. Good gameplay thought. Love a challenge. Maybe some updates to the tracks will come out.
B00DC3DGSK|2.0|Bobby Bland started to do the same thing near the end of his career, put out sub par records. Sorry but that's how I honestly feel. Waste of good vynal  and my money.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app is pretty fun.. always has a new challenge to defeat. And it has minions! MINIONS!  Gotta love them. I say get the app
B00336G7HI|4.0|Have been using it for some months now and it's still working after several chargings ..... So far still good & no complaints.  After all it's an original SONY, right!
B00008BLAS|3.0|This is an uneven album from Grand Funk. Although the song \\"Shinin On\\" is a good song, songs like \\"The Loco-Motion\\" and \\"Mr. Pretty Boy\\" are ordinary and do not have the Grand Funk spark. They get 'bluesy' on \\"Destitute & Losin\\" and the vocals on the second \\"Shinin On\\" are interesting. It is like an ok album versus a good one. May be worth your purchase.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Not a fan of the new format but was getting used to it.  What I can't get used to is that it keeps freezing my kindle fire.  I've reinstalled several times but it works for a few days and then starts freezing again.  Please fix it or go back to the old version.  The new version is more bother than it's worth.
B0073COMKW|2.0|I purchased 3 bulbs and the first two worked fine and gave off a fair amount of light and almost no heat in the fixture. I suspect the problem with the third bulb is that the quality control may be not yet up to typical light bulb standards. If you are thinking of putting these in any hard to reach area take a few minutes to try them out in another fixture or lamp first.  I gave the bulb two stars because I expected all three to work and was disappointed and a bit upset by the wasted time when one did not.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|One day on the radio they played Summertime Sadness. The techno version. I got into the lyrics right away and her voice. Search on utube and i found the original version. I loved the song even more. I bought the CD.<br />In these days when all the songs are about naked girls, drug- alcohol use, party hard...i found Lana Del Ray. A girl that signs dressed...and she really sings !<br />The whole CD is a masterpiece. Great lyrics, melody , great voice and a little bit on the dark side. This is definitely for me .<br /><br />Rihanna, Perry, Gaga listen to this and learn ! Music is art and this is art. You girls are prostitutes in thee musical industry !<br />Thumbs up Lana !
B009AMANBA|1.0|Got this from the library - I was excited because I waited almost 2 months for it.  I figured it HAD to be good if it is that popular. WRONG!  Its a typical Spielberg, using his films to push an agenda.  Lincoln was not believable and the acting was so so.  It was a vehicle for \\"messages\\" starting with soldiers quoting the Gettysburg address.  Soldiers, dirty and tired, born in the 1850's, in the midst of a bloody war, memorizing a speech and repeating it with perfect recall, grammar and diction like college grads.  REALLY?  We watched about half and since I love history, truly wanted to enjoy it, but couldn't.  It dragged, it was boring, it was dark (both filming and the story).  I've read plenty of Lincoln biographies, studied the Civil War from all sides and I can tell you, this is merely twisted history with a heavy thumb on bloody scenes.  I like a political film now and then, but when history is \\"tweaked\\", and an historical character is not even close to real - there should be some sort of pre-warning that this is not accurate history and produced from the viewpoint of its creator.  When Spielberg goes back to making those great sci fi movies, I'll watch one of them.
0767836286|4.0|This is a edge of your seat movie,  I loved it. You have to sty right with it you can't leave the room or else you will miss a detail that will leave you wondering what is going on. Otherwise great show!
B000002KGT|5.0|I had to buy this CD because it was the first time I had heard of Rumours when I dated my now deceased husband. People had moved in and out of the house after his death in my attempt to survive, but wound up stealing this orginal owned CD by husband when they moved out.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is great . It is a must get kind of app. You must try it  . You will love it.
B000002O1P|5.0|Anyone that likes Tom Petty music will love this CD! I have it in my multiple disk player so that I know I will always get to hear their songs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A must have u guys have to try it out it is a really fun and fast paced game great for all ages!!!!!
B000002O5L|5.0|Tom Petty CD is wonderful! as well as all of his music is. I had bought this CD after I started to date a man that mentioned he liked Tom Petty's music.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is so fantastic  my daughter had to use the  book for her report for the summer and she enjoyed it so much and I recommend this book to read to your kids such a great book
B00B4804KS|5.0|We were very impressed with the job they did turning this into a 3-D film! They breathed new life into this classic movie!
0307352153|5.0|I am an introvert and this book has made me feel &#34;normal&#34; and not try to force forward what does not feel comfortable...but to be proud of my &#34;quiet&#34; self.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun fast and not boring! Very enjoyable. Was introduced to this game at work during lunch time. I highly recommend this game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|nice app that makes you think!  not too hard and just when you want to give up you find the exit.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It had a great story to it.  All of John Grisham books are very interesting and I enjoy reading them.
0871164566|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for.  Easy to follow projects and easy to understand for beginners as well as a great guide for intermediate users.
B0007939NO|5.0|Gene Kelly did it again in this timeless movie. He sings and dances into our hearts and the hearts of a legendary (maybe even imaginary) town in Scottland.
B005ONMUHO|4.0|This COPY of the original, unedited Atom Egoyan movie is very good.  However, this was obviously a dubbed copy shipped from THAILAND (?) and the videoi quality is not up to U.S. standards.  Audio is fine, and I liked the optional use of the CC audio in sync with the video.  QUESTION?  Why is the original, unedited, Canadian version of the film not unavailable? Another edited version of CHLOE also offered by Amazon is a complete let down .  eg
B000SFD21Q|5.0|I loved this book. It was an &#34;ordinary man's &#34; guide to the brain. I found it useful personally and as a teacher of students with disabilities. It explains how the brain is responsible for everything in our bodies, but more importantly.. it explains how we can change it and make it better. A must read for anyone interested in increasing, controlling,  or regenerating aspects of their brain.
B0055SWM08|5.0|love this game.. I played it for the first time a long time ago and forgot about it until recently. It's such a relaxing and beautiful game! Extra fun on a rainy day with a cup of tea if you ask me! Well worth 99&cent;!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What a handy-dandy tool!  Big numbers, and easy to use.  It was easy to install and from the first easy to use.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|. Teaches my children the right way to say the words. Very helpful. Like that I get to see previous words used
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Spoilers - If you haven't seen it and formed your own opinion, better not to read this.<br />I would like to add my own interpretation about this show...what I think was \\"really\\" going on (IMHO).  I've enjoyed the many reviews pro and con that I've read here.  I didn't get to read them all, so someone else may have already stated a similar interpretation to what I'm saying here.  First, I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this show from start to finish.  I like ambiguity in a show or a book or any story since there is so much of it in life anyway---neat bundles of answers are unsatisfying and too phony for me.  Therefore, the many unanswered questions that so many reviewers have talked about, don't bother me.  I originally saw the show when it was on TV over the 6 years.  As I watched through the seasons, I didn't have any particular conclusive thoughts about it all...I just watched and enjoyed the mysteries.  Then when I saw that final episode and the final scene in which Jack comes running back to the bamboo field (where we first saw him in the first scene of the pilot), it suddenly clicked in my head that they had ALL DIED in the original plane crash.  The island was not a real, physical place, but rather a spiritual limbo where these dead, damaged, flawed people could all come together to try to resolve problems in their lives, to bare their flaws to each other and help each other find some kind of peace, or love, or just something meaningful for each of them, so they could finally \\"leave\\" the island...maybe like a release of their souls.  They don't know that they are dead---they think they have survived a crash and are in a physical location from which they are trying to be rescued.  About 2 months ago I bought the series on DVD and watched it for the second time, and I realized that there were several episodes in which a character says some version of \\"We all died\\" or \\"We are dead\\".  For example, in the episode \\"Tabula Rasa\\" (right after the pilot, remember...the clean slate), Jack and Kate are sitting on the beach and Kate wants to tell him the bad things she did in her past.  Jack tells her he doesn't want to know and says: \\"Three days ago we all died.  We should all be able to start over.\\"  Naturally we would typically take this to be figurative, and I think Jack says it figuratively from his point of view, but I don't think it is.  Also there are other episodes in which different characters say this---I should have written those down as I watched the second time.  Other characters on the island, also dead, but not from the 815 plane crash, are in the same limbo of sorts....mostly trying to get off the island....for example, the Dharma group and the time travel are all efforts by the island's inhabitants to resolve problems from their lives and to find some kind of release, ie. get off the island.  At the end of the story the 815 group reunites after all their trials, at which time their group realizes they are dead and they are at peace with it.  The scenes we see where people seem to be \\"off\\" the island...well, to me they are not off the island really...they just think they are....again, just all part of them trying to resolve issues in their lives....feeling like they are making headway getting off the island.  The sideways flashes I think are for us to see what could have been these people's lives...if they hadn't died on flight 815 or in other ways...maybe they would have all come together in some other variations...with some ever so slight changes in their choices or their destiny---whichever school of thought you believe in.  Anyhoot, that's my take on this great adventure....enjoy it and hopefully find your own meaning to a fascinating story !
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Very entertaining! Spend all day and night trailing it. Can't wait to get further in the game and see where it takes me.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Interesting read.  Had to pick up the book because the play and movie is harder to understand.  Now i get the story line.
B004K58GSO|5.0|I remember I used to watch all these John Wayne movies with my dad. Although John Wayne made this same movie a couple of time, Rio Lobo, this one is the best.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|One of those bucket list reads.  Didn't read it when i was in high school so i just through it in the bucket.
B00CWVFPGO|5.0|Arnold always puts on a good show. This movie was a little campy in spots but it was definitely worth renting.
B000HL093A|5.0|Just an awesome movie!  Great soundtrack, amazing videography, and cast.  A must see for anyone who appreciates a well made movie
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Essentially just agreeing with other reviews. It's not too terribly difficult, but that can be a welcome break sometimes. Yep.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed this last book in the series.  It was just as good as the other two.  I liked both the hero and the heroine and thought the ending was satisfying.  I would recommend this book to friends.
B00E88YNJY|1.0|This is not my kind of music. Amazon please arrange to remove this bunch of noise and do a refund
B000YJ54DU|2.0|A real let down for Reacher fans. The author expands the hero's powers of deduction to almost superhuman capacity, taking away from the regular guy persona that made him popular. The author also uses the book to be both a little preachy and self righteous, in areas of the war as well as religon. I will give him another chance and hope this trend does not continue.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I want to redecorate my house and update my wardrobe based in Downton Abbey!!  I hope that this season isn't the last one.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|It's better than penciling in all the options on a paper book!  I like how it automatically tells you if you've made an incorrect choice.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I loved it!!! Very sweet movie ...I read all of Nicholas Sparks books and this movie was a must see for me.....
B0036BP6XQ|3.0|I wanted the DVD as a gift.  I have already seen The Blind Side many times.  It was somehow ordered, by mistake, for my video library, which I don't use.  I tried to cancel the order, but amazon still charged me.  I wanted to give the DVD to someone, and I wasted $9.99.  Your site needs some options for canceling, and being more clear about ordering a DVD.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I loved it!!! Very good movie.......The boys in this movie were absolutely divine!!!! I will watch it again and again.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|From beginning to end, I couldn't wait to read the next page.  I lost sleep trying to finish it. Chimamanda took the words out of my mouth. Loved it!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I loved it!!! Bradley cooper  Jennifer Lawrence what more could you ask for........i think she is absolutely divine....!!!! !!!!! Hilarious!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Love it. Very creative! Nice to have on multiple devices to try different things. Runs very well on my kindle fire...
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|After all these years NKOTB still has it! Every track is great. I liked the 2008 album &#34;The Block&#34; and &#34;10&#34; is even better. Such a great album. I was worried it might be cheesy because they are trying to keep with the times but NKOTB did not disappoint. Forever a fan. Survive you is a beautiful song. Great Job Guys!!
0061777269|5.0|After my son died, I started reading everything I could get my hands on.  This is the best of all as you can read the studies and how physics is used in some of them, plus it is a light enough read with ample material for those who aren't ready to go into the depths of how an afterlife is shown.  I highly recommend it.
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|Not much to say... I got this game as one of the free games in Amazon's free app of the day and it's pretty fun. I enjoy playing it.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I cried for the last 2 chapters but this book has changed my view on euthanasia.  Everyone has the right to choose.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Knowing the characters from Book One, then following the families through WWII gave me a real understanding of how it was to live through the devastating destruction of WWII.  True to history, the story provided insightful views of the politics of the time and personal involvement in the more well-known battles.  I usually do not choose books about war, but this one is extraordinary. Can't wait to read book three.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I so enjoyed the story and the changes of viewpoint on each chapter (character).  It had me going til the end
0553386816|5.0|I usually try to read a Grisham book as soon as it comes out, but for some reason I just wasn't excited about this one that was all short stories so I left it on the library shelf.  I don't know what made me finally pick it up now, but I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.  John Grisham certainly has a way with words.  I almost laughed out loud several times.  I truly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is an awesome game i love to play it all the time on my kindle fire. If you are looking at reviews to decide if you should get this game, choose yes. I give it five stars.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|received this doll today.  it is beautiful.  highly recommended!!!  i have started a collection of the holiday ones since my granddaughter was born.  she is 5 now and every year i get her one of these.  the one this year is just gorgeous.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|I bought this movie for my grandchildren who are 2 and 3.  They really enjoyed the movie and the music.
B008220BLG|5.0|I originally saw this movie because I am a big fan of the lead actor. Typically I avoid horror movies and zombie movies in particular, but this took on the subject matter without too much unnecessary gore or scare tactics. It's an entertaining comedy with just the right amount of heart...and brains.
1885167776|5.0|The authors do a fabulous job of helping the reader break down the complexities of life and business into one thing - as defined by the Focusing Question.  I really like the way this book challenged some of my pre-conceived notions and de-bunked some myths.<br />As with most books on personal development, there is an abundance of motivational quotes.  All were highly relevant to the topic and worthy of re-visiting.<br />The discussion of the Pareto Principle, now taken to the extreme, was an insightful twist on a commonly-applied process.<br />My favorite chapter of all was chapter 15 on time-blocking.  Of all that I have previously read and studied, this was the best treatment on this topic that I've ever encountered.  I have changed my daily default calendar as a result.<br />Another great discussion covered the 4 Thieves of Productivity.  Again, there were some challenging perspectives that forced me to pause and reflect.<br />Overall, this is a winner and I highly recommend it!  Get it, read it, re-read it, and share it.  While it's simple, it's not easy but worth the effort.
B007JMW46U|4.0|There are all sorts of Sherlock 'look-alikes', And then there is the real Sherlock Holmes! This is is the latter
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Sometimes a book starts out and I want to read the ending so I know if I'm going to be happy or sad!!  Those are my favorite books.<br />It was a book that made me mad, sad, and happy, so how can you beat that for entertainment!  Well written, very much enjoyed!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The race car and the tank rock!  The moon track is fun.  Lot's of fun!<br />Just got the double decker bus - too funny
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Fight club is just a epic movie, if you have seen it you know why.  If you have not seen it... WATCH IT!!!!!
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|We enjoy watching his Matt McConaughey and young cast  in &#34; MUD&#34;, it was emotional and thrilling movie to watch.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you have ever wondered what is on the other side, Dr. Alexander can tell you....what makes this story so unique and important is that it is told by a scientist, a person who did not believe in the afterlife....I recommend it....
B001FZ0A72|3.0|These dark, brooding melodies would be great accompaniments for one's most reflective and dolorous moods. Not recommended for the suicidal.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|Well written in Grishman's style. He has written this for the unger generation and it works. The older generation will enjoy it as well.
B001FZ0A7W|5.0|The gifted singer featured on this CD seems to be channeling Jim Morrison of the Doors. I didn't believe in reincarnation until now.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|It takes forever to load or connect then forcecloses over and over so you have to redo allot of stuff its a nice game but very frustrating
0307744434|3.0|If I don't really get into a book by the first three chapters, then I usually do not even finish it....which is sort-of the case with Night Circus. I skipped through the middle and went to the last chapter just to see if it had any meaning to it. In short, I was pretty disappointed. Maybe the movie version will be better?
B006QPX7UI|2.0|This movie did not do the entire battle justice - it focused on a couple of specific battles. The battles focused on were done well but there wasn't enough about the entire battle.
0985557834|5.0|The designs are fairly easy to follow, and I love all the different designs in this book.  It was a great addition to my crafting library.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|Loved the movie. It was very funny and entertaining. I wish I would have bought it instead of just renting it.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I really enjoy these type of strategy games and have not been playing this one long, but I agree with the other reviews. I too do not follow the crazy of social media and resent having to post things on Facetwitterspace or the such like. I also play for enjoyment, not to gamble half my income away! I would prefer to spend a few pounds on purchasing the game and having the pleasure of playing rather than the frustration of having to but 'in apt credits'. That said this is a really enjoyable game to while away the hours.
B000EULJLU|4.0|This cd was a great cd and a great band to listen to, another cd to add to my Tool collection since you can't download Tool's songs off of itunes.
1490313370|5.0|Great book, calls your attention to the changes that have been made to this country's economic system and, consequently, how you must change to fit in the new economy.  We already know of many of the changes, this book points out that you better not wait for your old job to come back because it won't. Middle class is gone. We need to change, and in order to match the economy, we need to understand just what it is developing for work and the ability to provide for one's family.  Quite an eye-opener. I am sending one to each of my kids.
0345529057|5.0|winter is coming
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Understandable, humorous and astounding!  So far I've done 2 of the experiments and will be doing the 3rd today.  This book explains exactly what I needed to know on how to apply the &#34;what you think, you create &#34; experience, in a way that I really was able to understand.  Am so excited to do the rest of the experiments, and then to go &#34;create&#34; my life.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The problem is you run out of energy way to quick. I mean it's a fun game and all but you have to wait forever to get more energy and if you want to keep playing and the energy runs out you have to buy more.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed all 3 seasons and was very sad to see it end.  I am marking the days to season 4!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is totally worth the 7$ u don't loose worlds when it updates and no manual updating either yay!
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|well let me begin with most of my favorite movies come from out of the country not a fan of hollywood most of the time and when i herd they were remaking this i was not looking forward to watching then i had to review it about a month ago,wow i was really shocked,i will say it,ITS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL yes i said it,good acting for this kinda movies,filmed beautifully very bloody goodness in the end,less humor but makes it a fun watch still.I really loved this one if your fan of the old films evil dead1,2,and army of darkness get this new remake really worth your time.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I was once a child who could not go to sleep now I can I love this app FREE you should tri it all ages&middot;<br />&copy;
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! It's fun also you can learn a lot about how to take care of a horse.This is a very fun game and I recommend this if you love horses but can't have one in real life.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Okay, somebody will probably say that the special effects are not all that, but I thought it was good.  Is an enjoyable fantasy/action  movie to watch on a rainy night.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love this game, I remember this one of the first games I start playing long time ago, so It is fun!!! For me and my family it is amazing to play this, this has something that makes you try and try and try, and you are still entertained, it is a challenge!!!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I do enjoy a good scifi movie every once in a while and this one fits the bill for me.  Interesting twists and story.  Couple of scenes did not make common sense...like standing in the open fantasizing about a ball game while in hostile territory, but all in all a good movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Is Fantastic, because you have to find a home for the animals, and you have a lot of activities and stuff to do, and with Scratt the squirrel you have to defeat the piranhas like fighting Kung fu and it is funny, and you can buy coins and acorns to build more things in the village. An you could even visit your friends village.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I bought the game for my Nephew for his seventh birthday.  He loved it!  And he was really good at it.  We were guessing what his creations were within 4 minutes of him starting to build them.  The adults played it later and we had a blast too.  Great game for all ages.  Even my four year old wanted to play (he had to partner with me of course, but he sat there the entire game and loved guessing what everyone else was trying to build).  If you like Lego's, you'll like this game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game because you have to think and to build way on how to solve the puzzle, so this makes you think in possibilities. So it is really funny and entertaining.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Too much time trying to show the initial relationship that wasn't there. Needed this time for Cruise/Freeman relationship. Effects a little weak also. I like Cruise even in Knight and Day.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like this game because I had fun building the Pony Ville.  I recommend this game to My little Pony fans. It has a  lot of activities to solve and it is entertaining. You have free activities.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I was sad to see this was the last book. Sookie's story wraps up nicely. I know that another book is coming out that wraps up the other characters lives. Looking forward to that
B005ZI2ZUK|5.0|OVER THE FENCE is such a cute story with a brilliant collaboration between writing and illustration. We read the story several times back to back with our daughter. The hidden content is noteworthy.  We found ourselves cluing in on nuances not previously recognized.  The stickers on the wooden crate were nice little details.  Curiosity flared upon noticing the flag stickers from the USA, China, France, Canada, Austria, Italy and Macedonia. Brilliant!  The rhymes flow nicely. The idea of the character named Albert setting up a guessing stand was creative. This story has so much to offer young children.  The story requires children to use basic deductive reasoning to solve the mystery. We've read many children's books throughout our child's early learning years and many were fun and cute, this story however, is extra special in that the child is introduced to thinking on their own, requiring them  to reason and deduce.  Aristotle would likely be very proud of the author's use of some very basic principles of logic.  We enthusiastically recommend this Peter Collier Children's story!
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Watch this now! Dave Grohl hits a home run with this ALLSTAR packed doc.<br />To know that he also got a record out of this is amazing. I loved Probot, and this takes Dave's honoring of his influencers to a new level.
0765334798|4.0|I listened to this book on Audible, read by the sincere and enthusiastic Wil Wheaton. I believe Wheaton contributed to my enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />That said, I didn't know what to expect when I bought this book. I hadn't read anything by Scalzi before, so thought maybe it would pure Star Trek spoofiness. And it was, at first. But then it developed a real plot with real characters, taking unexpected turns and treading dangerously deep waters by the end.<br /><br />If you like Star Trek, have a sense of humor, and don't mind a non-traditional story structure, then I can recommend this book.<br /><br />(One star lost for over-abundant use of the phrase \\"he said\\" and some patches of unclear logic. To be fair, both of these may have been less evident if I had read the book instead of listening to it.)
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I guess after waiting so long for this after LOTR, I was expecting too much too soon. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, but I am just spoiled from the LOTR trilogy, I wanted the movie to last longer. I guess I will have to wait patiently for the other installments.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This is a book about how to make IT a part of your core business, and how to run your IT department in order to make business successful. This great content is disguised as a novel, and is a real page-turner.
B0000669JL|5.0|I'm a big Bob Marley fan so it should come as no surprise that I love this album.  One of my all-time favorite albums, period.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Every time a Super Hero movie is released i wonder why they aren't as good as the comics in terms of action. That has been remedied by the marvel of super battles this movie has. its what I've been dreaming of since the Max Fleischer cartoons, seeing Supe duke it out with enemies is what I've craved for a long time. Incredible Action movie for an Action Comic fan
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's novels (except the baseball stories--nothing against baseball, just like Grisham for the lawyer intrigue stuff).  This one is the best in my opinion.  He has a way with words and his characters tend to come fully alive (often wildly dysfunctional though) which, no doubt has helped make him one of the top writers in the world.  I noticed there are over 4000 reviews out on this one already and at first I thought, why bother, but then I thought, what the hell.  Maybe someone will scroll to page 70 and find this one useful.  Among his best stories, many of which have been made into movies (the Firm, Pelican Brief, etc.) this one makes the very top of my list, mostly because the hero is able to carry out an elaborate plan and fool the government throughout==a brilliant plot idea.  He also wins out in the end on just about every front (a situation which is not always the case with Grisham--his stories can end just about any way, perhaps with the hero swinging in the wind by a rope, but hopefully not completely dead--I have the impression he doesn't like to be predictable).  Personally, when I have 8 hours or so of my life invested in vicariously living in the shoes of a hero, I like for him (or her) to wind up on top of the pile--just a quirk I have I guess.  One final note.  While I think this story is his best, Grisham's worst book in my opinion was &#34;The Painted House&#34;.  lI am quite sure some academic types finally got the author's ear and convinced him that he shouldn't be so commercial or something and should write a serious piece a la Steinbeck or something.  I am so happy he gave up listening to that kind of BS and has returned to being the great mystery writer he is.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|Sorry, but this little kid needs to stop pretending to be such a bad-#ss in all these movies and show some acting range.
B00821OX98|5.0|I've continued on now with the second season, I love all the imagination of living with aliens amoungst us.  I really enjoy the program
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|This is a very addicting game and it is so much fun  it is great for the doctor office visit when you need to pass the time.
015603252X|5.0|Amos paints Jewish-Israeli culture beautifully in this period piece of his growing up in the newly founded nation.  Heart warming and tragic, the title is most appropriate.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|My girls no longer try to cut their hair or the dolls hair after purchasing this game.  It keeps them busy and if they don't like the style, they can actually start over, unlike the real word of hair.
B004RCUJ9E|1.0|I'm not rating the item; I'm rating the SERVICE!  This was promoted as a FREE app(Checkers), but it shows a charge.  I have been trying to CANCEL it since I click the button, but I can't!!  Why is this so difficult?  It's not even listed under my apps or orders on my account, but I have a confirmation showing the charge!!??
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read, although I say this about all the books I read this one is different. It made me feel as though the sixers were coming after me too. I felt apart of the book. This needs to be a movie. I would absolutely watch it, own it. Like I said Jaw dropping, there are so many unexpected things that happen in this book.  I am speechless to how this ended though. What is wade going to do now? Shut down the entire OASIS and rebuild the world or what I'm waiting for another book already.
B00DQLWOVI|5.0|One of my childhood favorites. Highly recommend this movie if you want a lot of laughs. Light hearted and fun.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I liked Red because the action kept moving and because of the selection of the actors. John Malkovich always makes a great psycho and teamed well with Bruce Willis. Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman added the right touch of class to the film. Together they made the film a viewing pleasure.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Everything about this show is top quality: acting, directing, writing. A great drama that is enjoyable to watch, I highly recommend it.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I think this game is fairly good. It is a fun RPG fighting game. I I I like like like it it it
B0041D843M|5.0|If you are interested in diet and disease this is a must read book. It is well written and easy to understand.
B007THA4FI|1.0|The reason I read books is to enjoy a bit of fun outside my own life.  How disappointing to read a book mired down in miserable circumstances and socially inept people with crummy and competing agendas....this book reads like LA politics!<br /><br />I wish Jo would stick with what she does best, which is creating magical places to visit and uplifting stories that are fun to read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I was recommended by a friend to read this book when I got home from camp I kept putting it off until one night I was looking for a good read I put on at the library. I couldn't put it down it is truly amazing.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|It's easy to use and protects my kindle nicely. It's light weight and the strap across the back allows for an easy grip when you slip your hand through it.
140006922X|4.0|The book is a fascinating study of the confluence of historical reality and religious fervor.  It makes the historical Jesus, in the author's words, a man to believe in.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This is a scam, a ripoff, whatever you want to call it. Maybe it works for others, it doesn't work on mine. It's just trash.
B000LXQVA4|4.0|it is all good. I just wish the setting and play tray was a bit wider, otherwise our babies are enjoying it.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|This was fun at first but it's so tiring to wait 5+mins in game for something to be done or pay real money to play the game. This one does let you do Swagbucks-type surveys/offers to earn in-game money, which was different, but it got old fast. And as long as my Wifi is on, it constantly sends &#34;Your dinosaurs are hungry! Buy this Trex for a million dollars on sale today!&#34; messages. Irritating.
B008Y79IUE|5.0|All drug addicts should watch this movie.<br />This movie shows you the phases of life while you are through that addiction.<br />It will show you how you could screw involuntarily without your knowledge.<br />I was upset watching this movie. Did not give me a good feel but those who want to try drugs should go and watch this.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|this app is amazing it has so many of my favorite gun the Springfield m1 grand for insince<br />if u say this apps wicks than u can sucked it
B006DZYM0A|5.0|Sookie Stackhouse has NO respect for Matt Damon's character or his overpriced bicycle.  This is a very crazy, very detailed story wiht a lot of bizarrely authentic uses of character actors and Michael Ealy.<br /><br />It's like using very expensive actors for the kind of indie film that looks really raw and shows up on the Sundance cnannel.
B00CATSONE|1.0|Sadly, I must agree with the others that no one should pay for this book. It's just not worth it.<br /><br />I don't have a problem with using the framework that tenacity and imagination fires genius and using Tesla as an example of this, but the set up was longer than the bio and after the bio the author stuck a long advertisement for his book on \\"finding your inner genius\\" (or whatever) in the guise of a conclusion.<br /><br /> I knew very little about Tesla and thought this would be a quick informational read.  I should have just stuck with Wikipedia.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|An aptly named group.  Love the variety of styles.  Different from most mainstream groups.  Worth turning up the volume on several songs.
B0034JKZ8G|5.0|This was a gift for my niece.  Since I had to watch it four times in 5 days once she opened it, I know it was in excellent condition. The recipient loved it!
B00AH69BPM|4.0|It does sound a bit of both St. Anger and Death Magnetic. A good buy though especially for any Metallica fan.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game really works well. Never locks up and plays well. I can't stop playing it. It's connected to my Facebook and makes it very easy to continue the game on my cellphone. Love it!!!!
B009WUBERW|4.0|This was an action packed movie that provided a fair amount of computer generated graphics.  Stallone was pretty good, the cameo by Chuck Norris was ok.
B000FA5STS|4.0|THIS BOOK WAS SLOW AT THE BEGINNING BUT GOT TO BE A VERY GOOD BOOK LATER.  I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY MYSTERY READER.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|On level 55. I do believe you can play this whole game without spending a dime. I am going to try. It does take time, but that's why I play the game.
B009WUBERW|2.0|When is the next flub made?  Who is going to get killed?<br />Military camaraderie is fun, always an extra word for laughs, yet this is too out of character,<br />with allusions to their Hollywood personalities, for laughs.<br />Then I see &#34;my helicopter&#34; - has my number - and it gets flubbed, too, with lack of continuity.<br />Good camera work, not worth anything but wasting your time.<br /><br />And HE wants to make a 3rd?  Without Bruce?
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|This set is great for young kids who are animal lovers! This set gets a lot of play in our house. The pieces are high-quality and sturdy.
B000W453KQ|5.0|A classic film with Babs, can't believe I waited this long to see it! Great look at what went on, scary to see how the govt. was overreaching, even back then
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Video quality is excellent, the transfer was professionally done to ensure the quality.  this collection is a must have for Godfather fans.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|it was a nice movie but once again not enough African American actors. I guess Hollywood on plans for one AA person to survive the next war.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|GOOD INSIGHT TO THE MENTALITY OF THINKING OF ANOTHER CULTURE FROM MINE.  IT'S EASY TO PICK UP AFTER LAYING DOWN FOR A TIME.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Go Its nice to have minecraft on the go in all but they need to update more its just not cool to not as much stuff as the computer it just could be better I like it yes but as i said before
B00DJWV11I|1.0|I should have read the extract before I bought the book because I hated the writing style right from the beginning..but i decided to give it a chance. It was written in first person, male perspective, so it felt like reading a diary of a horny barely grown-up spoiled brat - and I am sorry but an adult version of a teenage porn isn't what I am looking for in a romantic novel. i had no respect for the male hero whatsoever - working for his daddy at 28, coming from privileged family and screwing every female around him - that doesn't sound like someone I could admire. plus he was whining all the time about not having enough sex - I wanted to slap him and tell him to be a man, not a boy. it reminded me a bit of the movie 30 days and 30 nights which I absolutely hated.<br />Even when the hero tries to win back the girl he loves, he does it in such a cheap way - dirty sleazy talk (first call after he put her down and they broke up: \\"hello kate..so, what are you wearing?\\" third call: \\"i still have your underwear\\" - what? that's not a way how to say sorry and make a girl forgive you), cheap tricks (he orders a music band to play in front of her office - I would be horrified and embarrassed to have every colleague know about our dirty laundry, I don't find it romantic or sexy).<br />All in all, waste of my time.
B00634GHJA|3.0|Then I went to use it and at first reading the website on my windows laptop I thought it was an Apple exclusive product B/C it is not easy to find where it says it is also compatible for android phones, then I was having syncing problems for no apparent reason at all. Once these problems are addressed I would give it a higher rating.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|My kids sleep in the same room as I. I know I know, but I turn this on, relax them, and they are out.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like it. It is fun. It is a good time killer. It saves your spot when you exit the game
B007PTJOV0|5.0|best game I have ever played you should download this game if you do not you are very stuped love it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its really fun. keeps you entertained and wanting to continue playing. love those little minons.  I would recommend this game to everyone out there.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|The book has waay to many recipes and too little on accelerated learning. The book did not live to its marketing hype and nor is it as actionable as the first 2 books by Ferris.<br /><br />Though the tip on Stakes (not steaks) was enough to make this book worth it for me. There is good information but not an enjoyable or inspiring read.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie you are really short changing yourself! Its a classic 80's movie that I loved throughout my childhood, and now enjoy watching it with my kids. Although Michael Keaton is BeetleJuice he is only in the movie for 17.5 minutes!!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|hope new one after heros of olympus<br /> if so ill pay one hundred for new greek/roman book with chb or cj
B00CATSONE|3.0|Decent read... I enjoyed the tone and pace. I especially liked how the author pointed how money is no way to measure success, or intelligence forthatmatter
B00C6Q3UNK|5.0|love the look of this playset comes with doll i like collecting so it caught my eye had buy for my self to keep grandkids will  enjoy some day as a collector set for them great price shiped quick
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Seriously, this album is hands down my favorite of all time.<br />So many people don't really appreciate this band for their artistry and write them off as \\"that one band from the Twilight movies\\". THEY ARE SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.<br />Reportedly, this album was recorded while the band was on some hallucinogenic drugs and let me tell you, it's freakin' fantastic. It's like listening to their trip which I love.<br />\\"Citizen Erased\\" and \\"Space Dementia\\" are my two favorite tracks. Always put me in a good mood.<br />If I had to define Muse by one of their albums, it would definitely be this one.
B005M5PENG|5.0|great fun .. awesome team and bromance of the century! I never saw the original series, but certain enjoy this revived reboot.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|This record is a far cry from their heavier stuff (with the exception of \\"Assassin\\") but it is still so amazing. The work this band puts into their music gets completely lost these days.<br />This album has something for everyone, seriously one of their best.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good job I liked it, it was fun and enjoyable.  Read it you will too go Catina's go you can do it
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I truly love Jungle Book. Had to buy it on DVD. I only had it on VHS. Still one of the best Cartoon Movies.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I enjoyed the first of the series but thought there was a lot of useless information. This book is more suspenseful and has less of the useless info.
1400064287|5.0|This book is full of ideas that any marketer or PR person could use. I recommend it to anyone in these fields. A very handy manual and overview.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I remember when this show started. I heard such amazing things about it. I went to find it on my TV - no luck. I didn't get AMC on my satellite package. Darn! I had to live with all of the buzz swirling around me. Thank heavens for my Entertainment Weekly or I wouldn't even know the basics.<br /><br />Now I have been given the opportunity to see the very first season of Mad Men and I can say I now understand what all that fuss was about. I can't say that I fell in love from the very first episode - boy that Don Draper can be a louse! But then the show grew on me as I watched. It's complicated, very, very complicated. And I like that. Hard to believe that women were treated that way, eh? So glad I came of age in a slightly later time.<br /><br />The acting is so smooth I got caught up in the show and at times was quite lost in what was going on. I love when that happens; it's much rarer with television than it is with a book for me and quite a surprise when it does happen. I loved how each episode ended with a little shock to the system so that you were left quite anxious for the next one to begin.<br /><br />Mad Men is a truly interesting peak back into a time when women were starting to feel their power and men were trying to learn to deal with it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved every single minute of the book. It made me think about my own life and it made me want to appreciate life more. I highly recommend it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I enjoy the game.  I wish there was a little more competition.  You figure if you would raise dragons you would do something with them.  we shall see, we shall see.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third book was a little slow in the beginning but then it got so interesting I couldn't put it down! Excellent trilogy. Wish it didn't end.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love Minecraft because you can create anything you want on it, but Herobrine keeps coming I into my worlds and killing me or destroying my houses. Still, though, it's awesome!
B00003CWL6|5.0|May Hauer-Simmonds said: So artsy and beautiful! One of my favorites movies! I loved everything about it! The cast is great and the plot its outstanding. They did a great job.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Gets it every time! I have no idea how it does it, even some lesser known stars it will get. Simply amazing
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|I love Ray Liotta for me this is his best movie role. & Mr. De Niro  & Joe Pesci are a classic in this movie. You can't go wrong with this movie: The best!
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|This app doesn't try to convert your scrawling into actual writing. Instead, it treats what yo doodle as words, with linebreaks and spaces, pretty much like in-line little drawings. You can edit, undo, share, etc it's perfect to write your ideas and take quick notes, but in an organized manner. I didn't check the pay options because it already does what I need. Totally recommended.
B00005JL96|4.0|good movie<br /><br />scary parts but fun for all in the family<br /><br />kids and adults alike will enjoy this original movie
B000056BOR|4.0|A fun film to watch. Doris  Day always gives an enjoyable performance and proves she has a flare for comedy.<br />She has it all. Good looks, a knock-out in clothes and fun to watch her react to the smooth performance of<br />Cary Grant. A feel good movie.
B00CK6MUSW|4.0|A most enjoyable read as is with most of Mary Higgins Clark. She is one of my favorite authors. Good story teller, good plots  & always qualifies for that much used term &#34; page turner&#34;. I am coming to the end of her books so I hope she hurries up & there's a new one on the horizon soon.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|More fun than a barrel of monkeys. So much to choose and learn from the You-Tubers. Always looking for inspiration.
B00ECU2SGS|2.0|Thinking Matthew McConaughey could carry this off, we tried to watch. I kept waiting for it to get better. It never did.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Haven't had much time to use it on my Kindle because I am tied to my lap top so much of the time.
0399103422|5.0|`The Godfather' by Mario Puzo. What a journey! There was a copy of this book in my mother's library. In all those years I have never read it. Of course I did see the movies a while back, but it has been quite some time. The book and the fluid prose within was fresh to me. I think I will order the movies.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down. Puzo creates characters that are complicated and somewhat fleshed out. The `family' is a complicated place to exist, and one must be complicated to survive. The story is heavy on plot for- let's face it- plot makes a great Mafiosi story become an outstanding Mafiosi story.<br /><br />The heart and drive of the story comes from the Don's rejection of an offer to do business with Virgil Sollozzo, who has the backing of the Tattaglia family. Sollozzo's reaction to the rejection sets off a series of events that reverberates through the lives of every character. The Don's reasoning for the rejection is simple: it assaults his integrity and belief system. He sees that the offer can make a lot of money in the short-run. But the Don is far-sighted and knows such a business will destroy everything he built, and will ultimately decimate his beloved family. This creates a war between the 5 Families, and the repercussions of this war are felt not only in New York, but in the burgeoning Las Vegas, and in the sunny countryside of Corleone Sicily, Italy.<br /><br />I will not go into the story here. Puzo leaves a few questions unanswered in this book. I am going to move forward hoping that these will be addressed in `The Sicilian'. Puzo moves the story along in blocks, or major events. It is a different style of storytelling than I am used to, but an easy one to adjust to. The story is set up like a chess board, with each character being positioned to drive story. Yet, at the same time each character and their actions are driven by the events unfolding in their lives. It is a fine, fine line to walk as an author, and Puzo deftly does just that.<br /><br />Just a side note; Mario Puzo has a little fixation on male and female genitalia that kind of just sits there. I felt it added nothing to the story. I could make the argument that Puzo's fascination with Santino's (Sonny) extraordinarily large penis was a direct correlation with the size of Sonny's ego, bravado, and attitude. I didn't feel it was needed. Puzo was able to clearly show Sonny's impulsiveness, rage, and ego through Sonny's actions and reactions. I don't know. Maybe it was just me.<br /><br />I loved the book. It has taken me 35 years to get to it. There are a few books that maybe one should wait until they are a little older to understand and comprehend the nuances of the author. I feel this might have been one of those books. Had I read it all those years ago, I may have read the same story completely differently. There are several authors I feel this way about.<br /><br />I am glad I found this book at the flea market used books stand. Best $1.00 I ever spent!
1878424319|5.0|great book favoite i loved it will read this book over and over in my life i trulu recommend it
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is grate I wish it did not stop 2 my apps I think they need to fix that I think it because a double update 0.7.2 and 0.7.3 in 1 day I did not stop playing though.
B009AMANH4|2.0|Very dark scenes.  The movie itself was no where near the hype.  It never should have passed Les Mis. one
B004GYY714|5.0|it was very easy to use. I was able to find the stations I wanted to hear and the player worked well.
B008NW67E0|4.0|I've noticed that a lot of the songs sound very similar (with the over-existence of the banjo) but if you look past that, you'll appreciate the rawness of the music. My favorites are probably \\"Babel\\" and \\"Lovers of the Light\\" but the entire album is pleasing to listen to. I like to take this CD on semi-long car trips because it's very soothing.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|I was able to see only a few US channels (mostly religious) and the bulk of the stations were foreign stations.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Warning! This album contains exceptional singing by an outstanding cast. You'll be humming the tunes to yourself for weeks and hitting yourself in the head for not going to Broadway to watch the original cast (like me :/).
B001GUXJQA|4.0|I enjoy all of Michael Connelly's books. You are kept in suspense throughout the book. Very intriguing. edge of your seat reading.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Come on now, who doesn't love Star Trek movies?!  I bought the set so that my kids could see what being a Trekie is all about.  Granted, they didn't live through the TV series like I did, but at least they can enjoy the full-length movies now!  NOTE that these are DVD's, not BluRay movies.  That was my intended purchase (to use in smaller DVD players).  There are BluRay versions too--so be careful that you buy what you WANT to buy!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun for all without violence, darts or swear words<br /><br />You can buy upgrades but you do not have to<br /><br />Play daily and enjoy
B0095MVOMC|1.0|on this one.  I can't stand it.  Wish I hadn't added it to my collection.  Even the grandkids won't play it!
0761166173|3.0|I love the children's books by Sandra Boynton, but this one is not as entertaining as others she has written.
B000GWE44U|5.0|I rented this for two days through Amazon, and I really enjoyed it. Thanks, Amazon! I will rent again in the future.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Loved it.  As a long-time Star Trek fan, I loved it.  As a SF fan, I loved it.  As a lover of great movies, I loved it.  Bravo!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I knew how the book was going to end about 10 pages in. It was very predictable and unoriginal. Disappointed.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I can really pump up the speed on my eliptical glider while listening to this song.  Makes working out easier.
B0064QNS62|4.0|the game seems pretty cool.  My 4 year old son plays more than i do, but he cant write a review, so your are stuck with mine.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I love it!  The only bad thing I can say is that it's taking too long for Season 6 to come out!  I'm thoroughly addicted!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|A very challenging game.  This is the third G5 game I have purchased and worth every cent spent!!  I didn't want to put the game down.  If you like suspense at every level then this is the game for you!
B008LC8TJI|4.0|has a great voice and great to look at!  Its my first album of Maroon 5  and I will buy the next one!  Enjoyed every song.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this book greatly. The twists never ended! Definitely keeps your attention. I hope that you enjoy this as much as I did.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I didn't like the very violent ending of last episode.  It seems so obvious that the particular actor who played Matthew wanted out of the script.  It leaves a bad taste for viewers until the next episode comes out.  The rest of it I found very good.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book! Loved hearing the dog narrate. I was sad that the book ended & would love to hear more that this dog has to day. This is a book that I will encourage my son to read. He isn't a great reader, but loves car racing and dogs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mine craft but I wish there where a lot of electrical things like tv's and cameras and wire please update more and faster
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved the book and felt such closeness with August.  The author had true talent writing in the style and language that young readers could relate too also.  It was a great &#34;read&#34;'.
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|We started this movie over and over and kept falling asleep.  I don't watch torture movies.  The acting sucked and it was boring as hell.  A waste of time and money.  I would rather watch some old High Chapparell reruns.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My son & husband can't stop playing this game.  They love dinosaurs and really like being able to raise their own.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I see that Bubble Witch Saga is available on Kindle, but not Candy Crush.  It's the same developer (KING). I am not interested at all in how to cheat on the levels, I would just like to be able to download the original game.
0887306667|4.0|I bought this book used as I work my way through the Personal MBA reading list.  To my surprise it came with a coupon for $ 3 off KY ( not Kentucky ) products, but it expired in 1998... durn.  AWESOME little bookmark.<br />Excellent delivery and a little extra conversation piece.  Well done my friends !
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book. I read it and then a few days later read it again.. It was so moving and meaningful... a must read!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|It was a very good show my kids age 4 and 9 enjoyed it.  I plan on buying the DVD
B00BGD8CFK|3.0|It scuffs quite easily and I'm not confident it will keep my phone from damaged if dropped. The color is vibrant though.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|My kids love this movie Brave HD) They watch it over and over again on Amazon Instant Video they get to see it anytime.
B001NFT3Z4|3.0|I ACCIDENTLY ORDERED THIS ITEM.  BUT OH WELL MY PROBLEM SHOULD HAVE PAYED MORE ATTENTION TO WHAT IT WAS ORDERING.
0756405890|5.0|I love the concept of this book. I feel like I'm in the tavern, listening to a tale long ago, of a man, on his way to becoming a hero told in his own words. Kvothe is an interesting character and from the moment we meet him you care for him and know this story he will tell you, will be an epic one.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|LOVED THE COMPLETE COLLOECTION ALL TOGETHER.  MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT MOVIE ONE HAS A GLECH. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THANKS ALOT.
0756407915|5.0|This is day two of Kvothe tale. If things couldn't have been dire for Kote in the first book, it seems that they just seem to stay that way for him. I'm left with a lot if questions that this book did not answer but rather dragged up new questions. I'm anxiously waiting for the last and final book, which I'm hoping is a rather long one, as I don't want this story to end.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|The Camel Club series is fast paced and addictive, always leaves you wanting to read the next. Thanks David Baldacci for making reading so entertaining.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun game. Very addictive. Can enjoy for many hours of fun for the kids and the adults. Hope u have as much fun as i am
B00000J048|5.0|My 2 yr old who loves everything that spins was as thrilled to get the toy as I was finding it!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This place is where you review the MOVIE !!!!! NOT STREAMING PROBLEMS, SELLER PROBLEMS OR DISK MISSING/SCRATCH OR HECK EVEN A DOG CHEWED IT PROBLEM. See below for an example of how I rated the MOVIE and then maybe you will be enlightened.<br /><br />Wow what a fantastic movie. OWN IT, RENT IT whatever you do, WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!<br />And who couldn't love Kevin♡♥♡, he is so clever and colorful ;》<br /><br />See, not so hard to understand, is it ?!?!?
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|You have to love the fact that Ozzie still sounds like he did on the original Black Sabbath Album all those years ago.  If you are a Sabbath fan, this does not disappoint.  The boys still rock!
0553801473|4.0|I wanted to read about the characters I liked the most, and this book gave me that pleasure. All in all, it's still a bit slow moving in the format it's in, but that's just how Mr. Martin rolls. I hadn't realized it was written a number of years ago (2010?) so waiting for him to finish the story lines at this point seems like a battle all in its own. All in all, it is a well crafted book and I enjoyed it.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I am running of Jack Reacher books to read. I hope Lee Child is busy with new one. I am making Amazon rich but it's cool...
B00124PXW8|5.0|This is one of the best horror movies of all time. This was the only movie that ever made me sleep with my hall light on when I was a teenager!
0316201545|5.0|As with many on here who've read the book, I also have to agree that the second book of \\"The Land of Stories\\" was a huge step-up from the first.  Chris Colfer's writing has improved incredibly, the story is darker and more complex, and the end of each chapter just made me want to continue reading more.  It was a true page-turner.  I finished it in the matter of two days upon receiving it.<br /><br />While the first book, \\"The Wishing Spell,\\" was a pleasure to read, it was evident that it was his first novel, what with its cheesy descriptions at times and somewhat underdone storytelling.  At the same time though, I can see how the two books go hand in hand; while the first one was more about discovering about a part of who the Bailey twins are, this new one shows more of how they incorporate that information and use it to the best of their ability. If anything, I would consider that to be an underlying theme in the series so far; identity.<br /><br />Chris did a really excellent job with this book and judging by the ending (spoilers!), something tells me that there's at least one more book buried deep inside him that has yet to be written.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day understands how to write and how to interject the plausible into the improbable of pipe dream of this premise.  Totally love the crossfire books
B008OOYALE|4.0|It's fun to play. Love to watch all the dragons. It's hard for me not to buy gold to speed up the waiting processes. But, I love to see all the combos you can come up with. I can hardly ever put the game down.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love the crossfire series.  Looking forward to more of the romance and drama. Have read all three so far and am waiting for more
140006922X|5.0|The religious scholar Reza Aslan seems to have managed to bring down quite a bit of controversy on his head for daring to be a Muslim and yet write a book about Jesus, but for whatever this opinion is worth, there actually aren't very many new ideas in this volume. Albert Schweitzer offered a similar opinion about the historical Jesus a century ago, and backed it up with much the same evidence that Aslan uses here. To me the chief strength of this book is in its method of presentation: well written, well argued, and a compelling read.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love this book.  However, I found that the free version is missing the last couple of chapters.  Otherwise I found it a classic read.
B00E25KVLW|4.0|It's good for beginners. Basic Rails concepts are described in easy way. A lot of source code fragments are confusing a bit.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Enjoyed the plot line, the writing style and the twists and turn-- looking forward to the next crossfire book.  A chic book for sure-- have a glass of wine handy
B0060QM0AG|5.0|Beautifully written. I share Herriot' s love for the untamed countryside of Yorkshire. His imagery brought me back to this beautiful place.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Good game that makes you think and really examine every inch of the game. I like that the hints are tiered so in any given section there might be several hints but the first just helps get you on track without giving any answers.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Outview is a one of a kind suspenseful read. The pacing is perfect and will keep you interested from start to finish! The perfect formula of every aspect to have every reader ready for book 2. Add to your \\"must read\\" list!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|3D awesome , I enjoy it very much, I can't wait till the next one comes out. Great colors, I seen this movie several times before and still love it.
1452000247|5.0|An enchanting story, which was very strange and had had feel of Alice in Wonderland. There were so many odd characters throughout the story it was almost unbelievable! Stepping into magical lands through a clock reminded me of the Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe and with a witch, wizard and a dragon- felt like Harry Potter mixed in the story. The most exciting parts were the secret passages, spells, hidden worlds and howling vampire fairies. However, then the darkest parts surfaced, a bit scary for a children's book. It is full of hidden spiritual meanings and ideal for all ages. Sure to be a classic once discovered, loved it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love every thing about it.  The characters are interesting & story line always entertaining & full of twists & turns I'm not expecting.  I can't wait for season 4,
0761172726|2.0|I liked that this calendar started the month that I bought it, so I didn't lose any months but it doesn't really matter at this point since I wont be using it.  There is hardly any room per day/per person.  If one person has more than 1 activity for a particular day, you can't hardly fit it in the box.  For those of us that lead very busy lives & children with multiple activities, this wont help you much.  I wish I could have seen more/better detail before buying.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|First off my feeling with Electric is that it's Neil and Chris' answer to all the folks who complained about the more morose and personal tones of Elysium. Which I also really loved. It proves those haters wrong in my opinion that PSB has lost it. They've done such a brilliant job of evolving through each period and change in music, and naturally too not begging anyone for attention with pandering. They are still on top flat out. The modern disposable pop artists need to learn a ton from Neil and Chris. They'll be gone in ten years PSBs' music will last forever.<br /><br />Electric while predominantly a very charged high energy album does not lack depth and sincerity. Many others on here have covered things track by track and I'd like to keep this fairly brief by just finally stating that it's a great disco dance heart pounding album with lyrics that are meaningful and worth studying. Highly recommend it and say check it out.
B00821OX98|3.0|The acting and production values are good and I typically like this style of sci-fi; however, this show is infused with too much nationalism. I love America, but this is like going to a Tea Party meeting.
B00001W9G0|4.0|Got this as a mother's day gift, she likes B. Streisand, as far as I know great movie overall. so i have been told.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game. Cool game that makes you use your head.  Just wish it was longer and had more floors.
6305511055|4.0|I got this for my parents, they said I accidentally taped over their vhs version so I got them the DVD of this movie because they said it was excellent. they were happy overall.
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|this is a cd we all like to listen to and enjoy singing along with. Although I have to get it back from the kids some day.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I don't think this Tom Cruise's or Morgan Freeman's best movie, but this movie was pretty good. It can be hard to make a absolutely awesome film, when the premise is a lack of people, but this movie was good. It wasn't Tom Hanks, in Castaway, awesome, but it wasn't a snoozer, by any means!
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I love this little game and I can even win from time to time.  It is a great past time.  Almost as good as retirement.
B00DM0UTPQ|3.0|This movie was just okay. The characters are supposed to be Russian, during the Cold War, bit the actors didn't even attempt Russian accents. It requires a bit of imagination to get past American actors pretending to be Russian, while speaking in American accents. This film might have been better if they had more money to make it. Still, it wasn't horrible.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|How can anyone complain with this app.  It is simply great and easy to use.  Just be sure what you are getting rid of each time you use it and it will do the heavy work.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled's narrative is so exquisite that even though he takes the reader to a different time in each change, we are still in touch with the story line. This book is not as intense as the kite runner but it takes emotions to a different level. A great read. I am so looking forward to his next!!
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|going to buy the set as it is so cool and they give you plenty of practice with the free version here to get ready.  One of the better games out there for landing a plane.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Make a mod and it will be greater than this<br />I like it make it like in the computer that has mob spanners<br />And other cool stuff<br />By:kittydoesMC
B005JTAP4S|5.0|Like the Chinese shop that the young protagonist of this novel visits, this imaginative novel by  William O'Brien is &quot;crammed with all sorts of unusual things.&quot; The story starts with a perfect setup for an adventure: we have a ten-year old curious and smart boy Peter who is prone to daydreaming, and a mom who is preoccupied with daily tasks.<br /><br />But this is no ordinary adventure. The author, William O'Brien, uses his diverse experiences, from a degree in geosciences to a master's in science communication, in combination with his childlike vision of the world, to create a fascinating, mysterious, and multi-faceted world for Peter to explore. He brings in elements from a variety of disciplines and ways of knowing to weave this tale, providing the readers with a wide scope of possibilities to explore and ponder.<br /><br />Peter is fascinated with boxes, especially boxes with secret compartments, holding keys to adventures. Unlike a toy designed for a specific purposes, a box is an open-ended play object that leaves it up to the child to decide what to do with it. It allows for both control and imagination - great things for any child unless that child gets trapped in a box. Then, it could be on to Skinner-style experiments.<br /><br />The theme of new possibilities seems to be central to this story: there are doors to open, staircases to explore, strange creature to meet, and new experiences to have. And that's exciting. But you don't have to believe me. Explore this book for yourself.
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|Would like better tutoring but maybe I'll pick up more as I've played a little more.  Am enjoying it anyway.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|Have seen the stage show many times and the movie this soundtrack is from twice.  Amazon was amazing on the download speed and price for the album.  Great service from a Great Company.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I share this game with my granddaughter. She is learning care and responsibility for animals, as well as having loads of fun. The graphics are clear and wonderfully interactive. Cause and effect within the program is great too.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Visually ok. Predictable story. I can't even remember the ending. If that tells you anything. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
B00821OX98|3.0|I've seen the first two episodes, but I haven't been moved to watch any more.  The main actor.. Noah Wylie... is very good.  He's the best one from what I can see.  The effects seem a bit cheap.  I did see the 'recap' that more or less shows you where the story goes in seasons 1, 2, and 3...  I saw nothing that really grabbed me or made it crucial to keep me watching.  There's too many other shows vying for my attention, that I have to really pick and choose.  I probably won't watch this ever again.  I gave it a shot, at least.
B005LAIHHC|5.0|omg hilarious movie, you will never find another movie that will remind of this kind of comedy. you can see it more than one time and still enjoy it.
B00139XSBA|5.0|I read it a long time ago and saw the movie.  I really enjoyed revisiting this excellent book.  Wolfe's fiction does not hold up as well.

B0097EWK3A|1.0|This free game was difficult to manipulate.  The directions were unclear.  I only played this game once or twice before I removed it from my Kindle Fire HD.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this look at Bob Marley. Very interesting look at the icon. Learned a great deal of things I never knew, and found it to be inspiring. I would recommend the film to everyone.

140006922X|5.0|I was raised in the Catholic Church and attended Catholic schools through my first year of high school. I also have read most of the popular works on the nature of Jesus the Christ and the historical Jesus of Nazareth published in the last thirty years, or so.<br /><br />I remember my religion classes in school as being confusing.  The stories of Jesus seemed clear enough, but the motives, actions, sayings and interpretation of Jesus that was taught to me seemed disjointed, illogical and, to my young mind, incomprehensible.<br /><br />When I became an adult, began reading the Bible and books of scriptural and historical analysis (that included the Qumran material) seeking to clarify the story of Jesus.  I have never completely abandoned this pursuit.  However, the story of Jesus of Nazareth, his actual teachings, the encrustations and editing of it by the early church and the Roman Empire, have never presented to me a coherent whole.<br /><br />As presented by the Church, the story of Jesus just does not make sense.  But I realize after years of study, that the story does not need to make sense.  I know now that all religions are metaphorical, they all are an attempt to explain in words that which cannot be explained in words.  The Divine cannot be encompassed by the mind of man nor his languages.  So our choice of religion is in reality an aesthetic one.  (Though, of course, most of us do not actually choose our religion. We inherit it and accept it uncritically.)<br /><br />Though I am no longer a Christian, I tell friends that I believe that Jesus is God and that I try to follow his teachings.<br /><br />That being said, let me get to Reza Aslan's excellent book.<br /><br />The story of the historical Jesus of Nazareth as told in, \\"Zealot,\\" is the most cogent explanation that I have read.  Whether or not the story is 100% correct, I find the historical analysis persuasive.<br /><br />In any reading of any version of Jesus' story, you come away with the impression that he was a dangerous radical in his day, otherwise, why crucify him?  What Aslan has done is explain the various political and religious dynamics of first century Palestine that puts Jesus in an understandable context.  The most telling detail is one that no one disputes, that Jesus was crucified.  What I did not know until reading this book was that crucifixion was reserved by Rome exclusively for the crime of \\"sedition and rebellion.\\"  Jesus must have fallen into this category in order to be given this punishment.<br /><br />Jesus was a Jew who was motivated by opposition to corruption of Jewish law by an elite priesthood at the temple of Jerusalem who were at the top of a religio-financial pyramid that exploited Hebraic law in order to enrich a small hereditary aristocracy.  Jesus wanted to overthrow the corrupt system for the benefit of the poor and downtrodden and chose as his vehicle a well-known messianic tradition.<br /><br />Aslan explains this tradition and explores the, \\"messiahs,\\" that came before and after Jesus, how Jesus' ministry was different and more successful, and how his family members and followers kept his work alive and created a Jewish reform movement and anti-poverty ministry after his death.<br /><br />In addition, at the time of Jesus' ministry, the Temple leadership role of High Priest was a position that was purchased from Rome.  So rebellion against the Temple priesthood in Jerusalem at that time was, in effect, rebellion against Rome.<br /><br />In laying out the known facts of Jesus' life, ministry and the actions of his followers after his death, Aslan also illustrates how the historical Jesus was abandoned by the Church as inconvenient (and in Paul's estimation, as irrelevant).<br /><br />Saul of Tarsus (Paul), the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate, the High Priests of the Jerusalem temple Joseph Caiaphas and Annanus, and the Roman Emperor Constantine all come off as villains of the piece as being the opponents of Jesus' message.Indeed Constantine turns the movement into an organ of control for the state, completely negating the work of the historical Jesus.<br /><br />There is much more in this well researched (the notes section is well worth reading), clearly written and witty book.  I feel that, \\"Zealot,\\" has completely demystified my understanding of Jesus of Nazareth and Jesus the Christ.<br /><br />If you've been scratching your head over the story of Jesus as presented in the Bible, Sunday school, church or other books, this book is the one for all Christians and non-Christians alike.<br /><br />Highly recommended.Indeed Constantine turns the movement into an organ of control for the state, completely negating the work of the historical Jesus.<br /><br />There is much more in this well researched (the notes section is well worth reading), clearly written and witty book.

B00DH4BL4U|3.0|I gave the book 3 stars because the translation is poor and it looks like it was written by a 5 year-old. Although the content in the book is interesting. You follow Ibrahimovic from his days as a teenager from Rosegard until he became the best centre-forward in the world. You also get to know all the details about how complicated is to sign for a new club.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is so addictive!  It is very easy to use.. it gives a great tutorial on how to play. I originally downloaded this game for my kids to play.. but they haven't had a chance to play yet since I have been hogging it. The only part that sucks is having to wait for more energy to explore the rooms.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|It's a fun movie that's great for teens and college age viewers, and anyone older that loves great music.  A few of the charactors are a bit irritating and one turns around a little too easily.  But the movie has a lot of heart.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|Keira Knightley's performance as Elizabeth is Feisty and Headstrong, as well as overall beautiful.<br />This is a lovely version of this story on film, with terrific performances by Knightley, as well as  Matthew Macfadyen as Darcy, plus both the long suffering Brenda Blethyn, and Donald Sutherland as her parents... Sutherland's performance is positively awesome, especially very near the end, when he indeed brought tears to my eyes.<br />Matthew Macfadyen is a wonderfully fine and always believable actor, making you feel his emotions as Darcy, in what is a near flawless performance.  Although some might say he's not as totally overall physically ''attractive'' as Colin Firth's earlier performance in the same role, in very many ways Macfadyen is.. indeed Darcy.<br />See this film... If for nothing else to admire the ''rapid fire speed of speech'', and downright emotion packed scene that takes place between Knightley's and Macfadyen's characters in the pouring rain.<br />Overall, a pure pleasure to watch, as I've done again and again.
B005K2KCPG|4.0|Classic Rock sound and the signature sounds of Joe Satriani and Sammy Hagar.  Personally I could enjoy it if Joe just cuts loose on a song or two and does some wild freestyle soloing, but the classic rock sound is working for them too.  Seen these guys on their first tour and had a BLAST!  Go see them if you have a chance!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|so sad that Fringe has ended it's run, trying to finish the final seasons. sorry to see it go. loved it
B001UGB1X8|3.0|I've read several James Lee Burke novels, but not this one...I thought TLJ did a pretty good job as Dave Robicheaux, but the story line seemed kind of choppy - seemed like some scenes got left on the cutting room floor that would have made the plot flow better...I think if you weren't familiar with the main character, the movie would be somewhat confusing.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I love this app. it has all the features I wanted in the cozily calendar app without having to pay for the gold version of cozily. I especially like that u can view the calendar by the day or the week or every two weeks or by the month. that it is free makes it five stars tor me. also the icons for the events you input are a fun feature. it also has a notebook for to do lists.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Hard to write this review because of the tears coursing down my face...but a wonderfully touching book always makes me cry.  Told from the point-of-view of Enzo the dog, the wry but poignant musings of a canine whose devotion to his race car driver owner are delightful and true-to-life.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Some cool stuff but the villian is like Galactus in the fantasic four movie! Why Amazon must you require so many words for such mediocre ratings!!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|good action movie, great acting, special effects were well done, a lot of bloody scenes and violent action that plays with your emotions
B008XCF7Y6|1.0|Don't bother with this this it's a waste of time!!!!!! Such a waste of rental money! Gosh to many words required for such a piece of trash!
B000002KDW|5.0|Bought this for my husband he has wanted this for many years and now he has it in his cd collection one very happy hubby thank you.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I fell in love with this series the first time I saw it... am anxiously waiting for season 4. Superb acting and the humour is great.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Watched season one episode one just to see what it was about.  Two seasons later I was hooked.  Anxiously awaiting season 4!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very fun cute game, no matter your age. my husband and I enjoy beating each others scores. a must have game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very nice. challenging but not impossible. looking forward to more rooms. love that you can move to different parts of a room for clues.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved every second of this mind blowing game. Helps exercise your memory and brain. Can't wait for new one. Just didn't like there were so few rooms.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|i love every track on this cd. listening to it brings back so many memories.<br />so thankful to have found this on amazon!
B00BF123WG|4.0|Movies based on true stories are some of my favorites.  This one tells an especially interesting story for those interested in military/government operations.  Some of it was hard to understand since they speak quickly and in terms I didn't understand (some military/government terminology) but it wasn't hard to get the point.  Great action scenes, and some suspenseful elements.  I enjoyed it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 was wonderful!  Much better than Season 2!  I love seeing the family dynamics change and the costuming evolve into the 1920's!
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|I recently read the first in this series so wanted to see if the author kept up the good work... she did.<br />\\"Beyong Orial Falls\\" continues the story of Orial, the golden queen, and her friends, as they do battle with \\"Ala\\" in a world full of magic and mythical creatures.<br />Great characters and writing make this a great book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an Incredible book! You will love the characters and their unique and touching story.Not just for young adults..
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Oria turns eighteen but gets more than she bargained for! A family get-together marks the occasion when the young lady discovers she is more than just a typical girl, she is a golden queen!<br />A lovely coming-of-age story that combines magic with love. Recommended.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I loved this book. I thought it was just absolutely spectacular. Will be recommending to everyone! I might even read it again!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another fantastic Mitch Rapp adventure. The only thing bad was this is probably the last Rapp novel. RIP Vince Flynn.
B00622BF40|5.0|This is a little film that I enjoy more with every viewing. Whenever I watch it it makes me smile.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|It was amazing!!!<br />IT WAS SO GOOD<br />I WOULD READ IT A MILLION TIMES<br />IT WAS FIVE STARS<br />Not equable
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched this as soon as it became available on line. This holds up Masterpiece Theater's reputation for bringing total quality shows on for us. I own the first 2 seasons on DVD and this one electronically. As soon as the DVd comes out for season 3, I'll buy it too.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|Great gift and shipped/arrived quickly! Plus it is an awesome movie! Good humor from Timberlake and Mila Kunis! It's one of my favorites!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This gave an honest account of the events and helped me to understand what really happened during WWII in the pacific
B0012CH350|5.0|Batton down the hatches at night or when that storm is coming with this perfectly fitting cover for your small Weber grill
B0015DWJX2|4.0|The character development and quirky nuances of this story make it a delightful read. I was quite drawn in to the vast array of personalities. And its correspondence format gives it a unique and intimate feel. I was not crazy about the ending as it seemed antithetical to the main character's own ideas. But overall, I really enjoyed it.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|The wife and I watched it together and she was able to tolerate it even thought it wasn't a chick flick... she liked the main actors which helped a lot.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Magical! Suspenseful! Quick, easy read with everything you would expect from Neil Gaiman. I think it surpassed his other youth fiction. Definitely a must read.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Am very computer savvy and tried multiple times installing on Coby Kyros 9740.  Works on all other android products I own.  Even went so far as resetting to factory settings.  Still all I got was header and footer on each page, all books owned.  Extremely frustrated.  Ended up uninstalling and got nook which worked first try.  Needed for daughter's school, so she didn't necessarily need my kindle library, but didn't like that I was forced to pay more for the same book on nook, simply because app didn't work!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Legend Of The Seeker is great, action packed fun.  I never read the book and don't care one bit.  This show was a joy.  It brought back that sense of fun that was found in shows like Xena Warrior Princess, Hercules, and Sinbad, back when those were on.  This show is fantasy, action, magic, romance, and feats of daring.  It's a fun ride and I'm sad the show is over.  Season 1 was the best by far in my opinion.  It's sad this show is unlikely to ever see a Blu-ray release.  At least you can stream it in HD online, but I would love to own a Blu-ray set.
0385523394|3.0|I thought she needed to put alittle more details in the book and to make it into a book 2 for her life after the sentence. Enjoying Netflix hopefully it will continue.

B00DCRE83S|5.0|Old school metal with a lot of rhythm, which is not unexpected given the leader of the band. Love how you can feel and subtly hear the bass guitar but it's not as chunky as say Newsted's Black Album days. I'm still finding a lot of things to love about this album with every listen. Highly recommend this album if you appreciate quality music and real metal music.

B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Wasnt sure how i felt abt deb knowing dex's secret, but i like how they didnt try to hide it from deb. esp the scene where dex walks in and his slides are on the table!!!! I mean omg brilliant!!
B000002B35|5.0|I bought one just like the Pulse several years ago, and being I played it all the time I re-ordered it again, because my original one was beginning to skip portions, and I could not have this happen at all. Thanks for having the CD and at a great price,...Kenneth Young
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just like the real thing with some neat added features.  A fun way to relax and reset your mind.  I highly recommend it, especially for solitare fans.
B00A0MJA1I|2.0|The movie, although in a brand new package skips freezes and just stops working in the middle of the movie.  Very disappointed and so is my child.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Tom Cruise does his usual good job. The movie will not win any awards but it is worth watching. Don't expect Mission Impossible performance.
0553384775|4.0|To think, I actually considered passing on this book because the reviews were scathing. I'm glad I went with my better judgement.<br />Although Belfort is a bit wordy and the page count is pretty high, the book was an instant page turner. I was always curious to what would happen next. You don't hear how these stories everyday. I enjoyed it. If you liked the movie Boiler Room, this book is for you!
B009UZBLSG|5.0|No power supply needed for my Nexus 7. Mirror HD screen in 1 sec. Looks good and solid. A little expensive but useful
B003DWC6LI|5.0|I read it first in my mother tongue (Spanish) and my belly hurt from laughing. Didn´t change that reading it in English, maybe it was funnier because I kept imagining her with the British accent. If you need a good laugh, read this book, it´s great.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|One of her all time best tours. Brilliantly filmed and staged. 30 years and she's still on top. Showing all the younguns how it's done.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A not often exposed side of a handicapped persons feelings and unexplainable desires.<br /> Very well written: An honest story of human emotions and hardships.<br /><br />The  ending was perfect, and so well executed.<br /><br />Highly recommended
B00BUWY74M|5.0|I love this book.  There are very few books where I own all editions, and this happens to be one.<br /><br />The work is comprehensive, covering all aspects of season planning, training, racing and the ancillary work necessary to become a great athlete.<br /><br />I think the strongest component of the book is the season planning.  Most books just place things in a &#34;base, build, taper&#34; method without explaining why each should be done.<br /><br />This, however, brings me to my main beef of the book.  There are many ways to logically plan a season, but this illustrates just one method.  The book forces the athlete onto one methodology, and everything is based around this one method.  I believe the logic is much the same for each method; you build your basic capacities and then you build your capacities most specific to your goal race to an ideal level to compete well.  There are many different ways to complete this process.  This book does an excellent job of describing the logic behind one method, but leaves out some key paragraphs that would enable an athlete to prepare their plan around other models.<br /><br />The model the book prescribes (increasing basic capacities before advanced capacities and a more or less linear advancement of intensity) is effective - and probably the most universally effective - but there are other ways to build a season!!<br /><br />The other problem with the book is the lack of progression with the ancillary training.  The drills and weight sessions will be, in many cases, too advanced for many athletes at the beginning.  The drills are more the problem, but in some cases it will be the weights.  It's not a huge beef, but I'm a fan of progressively building into higher level drills if you can't handle them to start with!!<br /><br />All in all, a great book.  It is one of the most complete training guides for the triathlon, and triathlon books are among the best guides to endurance training!!
B005T9ZTSU|1.0|Meh...not worth your time. It just takes you to the flickr website and then Flickr blocks it...something is wrong with this.
B007VDN1PA|2.0|I am disappointed; scans from slides turn out too yellow or too blue, and a little out of focus. I uploaded the images to my PC, color-corrected, and loaded back to SD card, but the device no longer recognizes images after they've been altered. Luckily I only did one reel.<br /><br />Also, when you scan the images, in chronological order they are given sequential numbers, but when you play the images back on the device or TV, the images skip around. Very frustrating. My next challenge is to copy them from my computer, after color correcting, to a DVD. They will still be out of focus.<br /><br />I had wanted to get rid of the old projector and reels but ended up reloading the slides back into the reels and keeping the projector. For me, this device was a waste of money and time.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|It's fun and entertaining. Though I find it a bit challenging. Good to kill some time with nice colors and graphics.
B000089RV6|1.0|I have had this CD before but this one did not have the quality of the others purchased from stores. I like AC/DC music but something was not right about this CD.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|It works, but I wish the top address bar would scroll out of the way...that takes up far too much of the screen. Can't it hide after everything is loaded, just like chrome?!
B00E25KVLW|5.0|Simple, succinct, complete. Just right for a Kindle book. The place to start for a beginner in Ruby on Rails.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|It's great and i've used it on a lot of trips now. Nice to be able to guide yourself to the location. Wish I could search by name also in the local area though. That would be great.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is a triumph for Chuck Lorre and the gang who congregate at the &#34;Los Robles Apartments.&#34;  They do not require accolades to properly recommend this product.  BBT, Season 6, happily speaks for itself, just as it spoke in Seasons 1-5.  (...just as two or more quanties of &#34;adult male personage&#34; might still be speaking for ITSELF, if certain people could have simply learned some handy &#34;anger management&#34; techniques, like KEEPING THEIR MOUTHS SHUT!)  The first and last rule of Hollywood:  DO NOT MESS WITH THE TALENT... in case anyone missed the memo, this means Chuck Lorre!
1455526959|3.0|A bit boring and slow...not up to Mr. Connelly's standards; I did not enjoy it...sorry I bought it.  Plodding & disappointing...
B004UPANAI|2.0|I am a big girl now... and some of these comic book &#34;plot lines&#34; were wearing thin/thin/thin when I was a child.  Five decades later, notwithstanding some sweet eye candy for the screen, the plot lines are deadly.  REQUIESCANT IN PACE, already!!
B0053KWDES|4.0|It's quite a product. I've had for a few months. I got it from a lost and found bin. Plugged it into my laptop's USB and let it sit for a few hours. It just produces more volume without distortion. I use it on the \\"L\\" and \\"0\\" settings. I don't need too much bass (0/1/2 settings) or (Hi/Low settings) volume enhancement. It should have a bass knob if needed and have the volume knob to go to \\"11\\". Does a fine job with a pair of cheap 30 dollar Sony phones. I recommend it for people who need a bump in volume. Be careful though... it gets LOUD!
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|This is a great movie. I wanted to see it in movie theaters but just could not find the time. Enjoyed it at home instead.
0375842209|5.0|Zuzak's engrossing tale about two children struggling to grow up, survive and comprehend the adult world of Hitler's Germany demonstrates the negataive effects of mass brainwashing and abusive social conditioning. Yet the author has chosen to create--not Jewish juventile protagonists--but decent German kids who will learn to steal much more than books: the very hearts of readers. Their trials at school, inevitable parental discipline, deaing with street gangs and the beginning of puppy love are universal themes for adolescents. Even children can impact the lifestyle of the adults in their immediate social sphere. But how can kids distinguish which actions are truly Stealing, from those which are acceptable borrowing or haphazard acquisition?<br /><br />Also exploring the theme of the price of bearing a social conscience THE BOOK THIEF offers incredible insight into the values of friendship, family loyaly, human ethics and moral obligation. This thick YA book (550 pages) revels in the power of words, both written and spoken--even those words which never were, but should have been, spoken aloud in protest!<br /><br />Related by the most unlikely but ubiquitous narrator the story is<br />interspersed with comments on mankind by Death himself--that patient and overburdened soul-gatherer. The grim plot, which culminates in the bombing of Munich by the Allies, is lightend by the juvenile antics of Liesel and Rudy, neighors on Himmel Street--an area which becomes increasingly less Heavenlike. Our narrator interrupts the strict chronology with references to the Past or the Future; yet such somber foreshadowing only increases the tension, as opposed to destroying the joy of graudual literary discovery.<br /><br />It is several years after the death of her little brother and the complete physical separation from her mother that Liesel starts collecting her own little library--not exaclty planned, from unusual sources. But each book proves precious to her--either because of its content, the author or the \\"price\\" of acquisition.<br /><br />Liesel's young life was shaped by three wonderful adult men: a giver of teddy bears and bread; a man with music in his heart and hands; and a grateful, secret man whom she inspired to write and illustrate his autobiography. Having learned the precious art of Humanitarianism from Hans both Leisel and Rudy continue (however unwisely) to practice his life lessons of compassion--recognizing the universality of Mankind. A gripping tale not just for young adults, for but for caring peole of all ages and countries, this book would have won a sure-fire Newbery Medal if the author had been American.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|Great album. Glad to have it on vinyl! Definitely check out this band. The whole album is great, they're so much more than just a couple of radio hits.
B00992CF6W|5.0|MAKE IT LIKE THE COMPUTER VISION UGH I DON'T THINK THAT'S ASKING TOO MUCH!!! Other than that it's good :-)
B004JN1CW4|4.0|It was a good book but the ending was a bit unclear and needed to be extended. The rest of the book was stunning and I could not have enjoyed it more but again the ending was very abrupt and frankly was a little bit  disappointing and boring.
0062014536|5.0|I really enjoyed each book in this series; this one didn't disappoint. I am glad to have some closure, but wish the adventure could continue.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book made felt like I was in adventure. Risking my life out there but when I first read that book I though it wouldn't be as good people say it would. But I guess I was wrong.
B007STXHTM|1.0|The headline said for HERO Cameras with an &#34;s&#34; meaning all, but it will NOT fit the Hero 3 Black edition.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awsome I give it five stars because it is a fun game I wish the people cost less
B00B2PHSIY|2.0|this product was great and it cleared up a lot of underwater pics, With that being said once you come out of the water or surface and lets say you want to take a pic/video of your friends snorkeling you have to remove it or else the picture will come out very pink. After removing it for the picture the piece that hold the lanyard to the filter broke thus leaving it with only one clip to hold it on the camera and no lanyard, after using it with one clip and no lanyard safety I went to change a setting on my camera and the filter was gone!! to the bottom of Davey Jones locker!!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Can't wait for the next one!!!<br />The story of Cinder gets more intense with every chapter. 5 stars, hands down.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Recently rented all of the Harry Potter movies to watch with my daughter who was just discovering them and I found all of them to be just as fun to watch as they were in the theater. You won't be bored.

0783228457|2.0|A dash of Canadian sci-fi / horror schlock that's very much a product of its era. James Woods and Deborah Harry (yes, *that* Deborah Harry) play a pair of masochistic voyeurs in search of a new thrill, which they find in the form of a pirated snuff TV station. The plot staggers this way and that, bouncing without pause from '60s comic book cheesiness (one of the primary foils is dubbed Professor Brian Oblivion) to insane, grotesque '80s gore effects (Woods's character sprouts a jumbo-sized vulva in his chest, then feeds it videotapes). For roughly the first thirty minutes it's actually a legitimate, if silly, gripe about the dangers of an over-stimulated society, but once its imagery begins to venture into the surreal it really loses the plot. Woods's abdominal slit is just the tip of the iceberg. Occasionally enjoyable as a ridiculous display of bad taste and hilarious special effects, it grossly belabors its only point and fails to reward courageous viewers with the first hint of a resolution.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is pretty simple and fun.<br />Cheap I bought it for free.....later on in the game you need to purchase to get farther ahead. But all in all good if you enjoy city building.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|I was told that the Artic Silver 5Thermal compound paste was the best and it worked excellent. I used it to repaste my ps3 when it got the YLOD. No problems at all..
B00845MRKE|5.0|This is the best movie in years! The fan base is strong on this opinion. It is the first and only time I can recall where the critics and theater owners were so wrong that it is still debated how bad their reviews and decisions were.<br />When it came out to the theaters many patrons were shocked that it was not more like Star Wars. It does have Harrison Ford and Star Wars was still the new yard stick for being a film of the sci fi genre. Directed by Ridley Scott (Alien) it was slammed by the critics and public so much that it was yanked from theaters quickly.<br />The film did get to the public when released on video years ago and has been going strong ever since. It is the film that would not go away. Retrospectives and internet dicussions are still giving this film endless reavaluatios and critisism.<br />This version is excellent the transfers are very clean with no visible defects and sound is some of the best I have ever heard.<br />If you have never seen this film I recommend it just for the visual style and wonderful noir atmosphere created for this future Earth. Those that love sci fi must take a look just to see what all the talk is about.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Writing is excellent and author's many experiences are touching to other Korean Americans, I think. I strongly recommend this book to everybody.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game. Love the different rooms and categories like night, upside down, mist, shadows of the items u need to find.
B001DBF3E8|5.0|I had volume 1 (A-I &#34;The Inner Light) and had to have the complete set.  This volume has all the songs from I-Z (&#34;It Won't Be Long).
B0050SYS5A|1.0|waste of money, does not even work. It made my kinect a dark fuzzy gray and I had to send it back.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Good action & suspense throughout the movie.<br />Kids did some great acting, with one being so true to life.<br />Reese did a good job too.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|i was really excited for this movie to come out when it was first announced, but now upon finally seeing it, i can honestly say that it blew me away! The story line and characters, along with the new setting, were a great combination. Though there were a couple spots where i think the story could have been written a little smoother, it still had plenty of that classic pony charm and little bit ore to go along with it! Altogether, i had a tone of fun watching it, and would defiantly recommend it to any fan of MLP or even any one just looking for a great time!
B006RBZV82|2.0|chasing and eating each other.  Why can't we make a nature video that doesn't involve killing, or birth anymore?  There is a shark and stingray and whale in this for about 10 minutes.  This documentary is interesting at times, but boring overall.  Just FYI in case your getting this for your kids.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Just happy that I am still reading such an intricate story.  Every time I think I have something figured out, I don't!  Loving it!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Easy to use app. It does everything that I need it to do, and I love the feature to share content on pinterest and pocket!

B00DGNOMB6|2.0|If I was 70, this would be almost interesting...geez what a boring movie...kept waiting for something to happen...never did though
0525478817|3.0|I had to read this book for an English class and when I heard about what it was going to be about I was almost positive that probably wasn't going to like it. The ending is predictable (not that that's a bad thing) and the characters were just too, I don't know how to say it, scripted? Anyway, if you're into cheesy love stories than this is perfect for you.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Expected low grade pulp fiction but got an insightful and entertaining experience. This book is all about how people would react to an extinction level event. I loved the way the author moved expertly across continents and dealt with multiple levels of people while exposing the strengths and weaknesses of human nature.<br /><br />Good stuff! Would definitely recommend it.
B00AES0AZI|5.0|This is my favourite Koontz novel, without a doubt.  It is a truly original, compelling story with so much of the human condition and desire found in unexpected places.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. Its very addictive and alot of fun you will lose track of time for sure. The minions are so freakin cute.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I HAVEN'T USED THIS YET, BUT MY FAMILY HAS SHOWN ME HOW IT WORKS AND I'M IMPRESSED. I'M SURE I WILL BE USING IT SOON TOO
B007WTR2W6|5.0|The best thing about this book is that it completely deconstructs any arguments one might have against at least trying to start ones own business. It's hard not to get motivated by all the stories and the simple and to the point advice seems spot on (hard to gauge properly before applying them I guess). The only thing I really miss is a visit to the graveyard of failed attempts. Survivorship bias is always something to look out for and perhaps there are 50 well done attempts to start a business that failed for every success in the book, some element of luck is always involved in any endeavor and while it might not be much of a motivational tool it is a good reality check.<br /><br />If one starts a $100 startup there isn't a whole lot to lose though and that is the most important message in the book, just go for it! The worst that can happen is that you lose some trivial amount of money, some time and end up being a normal cubicle warrior anyway. If worst comes to worst at least you tried to get out of the 8-5 rat race, that is more than 90% of people can say.
B0063IH60K|2.0|THIS GAME WAS HARD FOR ME TO FIGURE OUT. I COULDN'T FIND WHERE TO START ANOTHER GAME IF I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO  WIN.
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|Enjoyed seeing Tennant with freckles and more serious. So far the mystery is interesting and all the characters are engaging in their way.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Excellent read! Brought tears to my eyes - very well written. I highly recommend it for a good summer read.
B00000272N|5.0|This is AIC's first major record label debut and its killer!!!  \\"Man In The Box\\" is probably AIC's most popular track and it's here on Facelift.  Now for some great tracks off of Facelift that only AIC fans will be familiar with: \\"Confusion\\", \\"Sunshine\\", \\"It Ain't Like That\\", \\"We Die Young\\" and \\"Love Hate Love\\".  The whole album is excellent.  If you love rock, metal, and/or classic rock, pick up this album!
B000XUAEUS|4.0|What a great read! Recovering from surgery I was not allowed to not do much.  This book kept me engrossed from start to finish.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Excellent information about an inventor that struggled against the greed of a few who use captilizm as a tool to take what they want at the expence of others, i was surprised at how many great inventions he made during his life. Too bad we cant find the black box wih that engine!
B006LSZECO|4.0|My friends raved over this novel, I found it a bit slow at the start but the end was extremely clever.
B008LA7RM0|5.0|This is by far one of the best album ever recorded. Pure genius! A timeless wonder for all generations. Do yourself a favor and buy it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Every episode I laugh and I cry. Amazing and addictive. Stayed up all night watching.  Every season is even better than the last
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft Pocket Edition; Simple, addictive, and loads of fun! I'm really pleased with the purchase of this game and surprised at how well it plays. In creative mode you're allowed a huge variety of tools and blocks to create without having to find them for yourself like in survival, where mobs such as skeletons, spiders, creepers, and zombies are always a threat. A great way to expand inspiration alone or hanging out with friends on multiplayer, where you can join up in one world, have snowball fights, explore underground, construct or destroy. Updates still pouring in. Totally worth the cost, and if you have the manage the right editing apps, it only gets better!<br />~Sandwhich
B000FCKC4C|3.0|There were parts that I liked.  The main character was very likeable.  It ended a little weird though.  A little anticlimatic.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Watched it with the grandkids. The girls, 11 & 9, enjoyed it. The boy,5, LOVED it. Has watched it 3 times since.
0812550706|4.0|This book needs no introduction, but just in case, Ender's Game was written back in 1985 (the year I was born) by Orson Scott Card and yes, part of the reason I started to read this book after so much hesitation was all the hype around it.<br /><br />When I started the book, the first thing I realized was that this book is not intended for kids, or at least I wouldn't give a copy to my kids (if I had). Ender's Game is a book about kids but not for kids, and I believe this is one important point for the parents out there.<br /><br />I had trouble keeping a constant reading with the first half, it took me so much time to get to feel empathy for the characters, mostly because there are many of them. No young adults, just kids and grown ups through the whole book, and then I started to feel identified with Ender's life which can be summarized in being rejected and misunderstood, by his own family and also by the people he is constantly exposed to. Of course I'm talking about a specific period of my life.<br /><br />From the second half of the book until the end I felt that the story became much better but rushed at the same time. Action started to take place and the pace of the book got faster, but then there was this other plot being developed in between, which was definitely interesting, but took many pages.<br /><br />Ender's Game is classified as science-fiction, but at the same time, there's more than just spaceships and flash suits. There is enough material to learn and debate over ethics, religion and politics but let's not forget that at the end this story is about a kid, struggling to find himself in the middle of an internal and external war.<br /><br />Disclosure: I did not get this book for review; nor was I required to write a review - I chose to. All thoughts and opinions expressed are my own.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|We didn't know anything about this movie when we rented it. A very interesting look at the side effects of drugs.
030758836X|3.0|I love a good build up but I a having a hard time getting into this one.  Maybe as I read it will get better&#34;
B0071XO8RA|4.0|My main quibble is that it gets warmer as you go deeper into the Earth,  at least after the first 10 or 20 meters.  The book implied that water at the depth of about a kilometre would be cold and all the geophysics I ever studied says the opposite.<br /><br />But it was a good story other than that.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It kept my interest and i would read other books by this author.  It explored a very difficult subject and handled it extremely well.
B006RXQ800|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. I normally watch a Movie once but could watch this several times. The acting was outstanding.

1451627297|3.0|11/22/63 poses itself as a novel about a man who seeks to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy, but I think it would be more accurate to call it \\"Memoirs of a Time-Traveler who just so Happens to Attempt to Thwart a Major Assassination.\\" Stephen King did extensive research for this novel, not just on Lee Harvey Oswald, but also on the time period itself. This is not your usual time travel story where the hero transports directly to the event he hopes to thwart. Jake Epping, the story's main character, instead arrives five years before the assassination, no closer. In order to pass the time, Jake, aka George Amberson, makes a new life for himself. In return, the science fiction plays second fiddle to George's teaching career and romance life. The book certainly has its gripping moments, and a pretty good romance thrown in the mix, yet somehow it is at its least compelling when dealing with JFK and Oswald.<br /><br />The novel's strength comes from the second plot, which is arguably the main plot, a romance between George and the sexy school librarian, Sadie Dunhill. Of course, George has no desire to form a romantic connection at first, but when your first meeting involves accidentally copping a feel while saving the clumsy Miss Dunhill from an embarrassing fall, that's destiny. Besides, love is timeless. The problems involved in this romance are obvious. George is a man with literally no past and a mission that will, sooner or later, conflict with this romance. The romance is giddy and joyful as well as heartbreaking.<br /><br />Though Jake Epping is a thirty-five year old from the year 2009, he has an old soul. This is one of the disappointments in the novel. Jake is right at home in the late '50s, early '60s. King could have had some fun with Jake's culture shock, yet he conveniently avoids the issue. Jake is a man with fifty years worth of knowledge that nobody else could possibly have, yet King loses any opportunity to have fun with this. When Jake does slip up, it's to sing \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" by the Rolling Stones, which isn't that far off. King lost a golden opportunity for Jake to sing \\"Enter Sandman\\" or \\"Bawitdaba,\\" at least something radically different from what was played in the '50s and '60s. But Jake's tastes in pop culture seem to follow more closely to King's than those of a modern young man. His knowledge of obscure '50s pop culture suggests King forgets it wasn't Jake who did extensive research into the era. This lack of culture shock comes as a surprise, since King handled it so well, and to hilarious effect, in The Drawing of the Three, when his gunslinger Roland finds himself in a world completely unlike his own. Perhaps King wants to say something about the adaptability of people, but I also think he takes this adaptability for granted. People thrown into an unfamiliar world don't adapt so easily.<br /><br />The novel is at its weakest when Oswald is in the picture. King spends a good deal of time having George listen in on conversations between Oswald and others that add nothing of value to the story. The main reason for listening in on these conversations is for Jake to make sure that Oswald did not have an accomplice. Today, there are still plenty of unanswered questions surrounding the assassination of JFK. King did some heavy research into the subject, yet decides to go with the simplest answers. Even Oswald is little more than a one-dimensional villain: vile, cruel, a bore who loves to talk on and on about communism, and a wife beater. He has absolutely no personality and does not feel like a real person.<br /><br />The ending of the novel is sadly predictable. I won't spoil it except to say that King had all kinds of options at his disposal, but seems to have lost interest in true science fiction speculation. He throws in elements of fantasy that serve to help him take an easier, safer route. For history buffs this is a disappointment. Despite a novel whose title and premise promises speculation, King fails to deliver. Not to say I wouldn't recommend the novel, especially if you are a King fan. There are plenty of engaging moments and the book is well-written and easy to follow. 800+ pages is a bit much for the story King wants to tell, but there are plenty of effective moments within those pages. Read and enjoy, but prepare to speculate on the matters at hand on your own.tion, King fails to deliver. Not to say I wouldn't recommend the novel, especially if you are a King fan.

B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Not a great movie, mediocre at best, and the ending drops off with little fanfare - to bad for Arnold, this one doesn't cut it.
B0090SI582|5.0|The Wolverine starts off a bit slow, but picks up once Logan makes it out of the woods to pick a fight with a few hunters who shot a bear with a poison-tipped arrow. After meeting up with a lady that says she needs him to go with her, Logan goes to Japan where he meets up with a dying man whom he had saved during WWII in Nagasaki after the US dropped the atomic bomb. Although Logan thinks that he was brought there to say his goodbyes, it is quickly revealed that the man has other intentions for him, wanting to take his power away in order to allow himself to live, and Logan to live a normal, mortal life. I won't go further as it gets a bit spoiler-ish after this, but the movie does have a nice pace at this point.<br /><br />The movie has some nice fight scenes (especially the bullet train one), a wee bit of romance, and a more than decent plot as well. Overall, Origins: Wolverine (overlooking the Deadpool part) was probably a bit better better movie, with faster pacing and some interesting back-story behind Wolverine, along with some good characters to boot, but this, in no way, diminishes The Wolverine movie, which also adds more to the backstory of Wolverine and plays into a great set up. I will definitely be picking this up when it comes out (hopefully around $15, instead of the $21.99 it is at this point).<br /><br />Hugh Jackman plays the part of Wolverine great as always and the other actors do quite a good job as well. Some of the translations seemed a bit off to me, but I don't know enough Japanese to translate it all off the cuff. There is a bit of a physics issue that shows up near the end of the movie (particularly what would happen when heated metal hits non-heated metal), but overall, there aren't any overbearing flaws that one might find in other X-Men movies (i.e. X-Men First Class, in terms of timeline) and it is quite enjoyable, especially if you like Wolverine as a character and the X-Men universe. I would definitely recommend this movie to almostanyone.
B00AFEY354|5.0|You know when books get turned into movies and they do it all wrong? Well this is not like that! I was very wary of watching this movie because I loved the book so much and was afraid that making a movie out of it would destroy the literature. Luckily, the author wrote the screen adaptation and also directed the film. It was wonderfully refreshing to see that the film did the book justice. It is a heartbreaking story of the awkwardness of being a teenage outcast and finally finding a group of friends that accepts and loves you, no matter what. The actors did a beautiful job with their roles. I cannot recommend this movie more, and if you haven't read the book, please do!
031623480X|5.0|This book is phenomenal.  There is SO much good information in here.  I'm not a fast reader, but I read this book in one day; I couldn't put it down.  The writing style is very easy to understand and interesting.  The info is invaluable.  This is one of the gamechanger books!<br /><br />There are so many things to learn about.  Such as!  The fatter you get, the more your brain shrinks (this explains a lot for me)!  And the portion of your brain that shrinks is the cognitive and memory portions. And the fact that diabetes sets you up for dementia and Alzheimer's.  There is lots of information on inflammation and its role in many illnesses, including nervous and brain diseases.  There is also info in here on depression and how a lot of it is related to gluten sensitivity.  ADHD is covered in depth.  This book should enable many people to get off  medications if they will try this lifestyle.  I have easily thought of a dozen people I think would be helped by reading it.  If I could, I would order multiple copies to give away.  This book has so much really important information for so many people.<br /><br />There was much information on gluten sensitivity and insulin sensitivity.  He went into lots of great detail on how many different ways the diet influences your body and your state of health (or disease)!  I am going to reread this book and make lots of notes on all this important information (that's how good this book is; I normally don't do that).<br /><br />A lot of the information in this book I knew about from studying up on the Paleo diet.  The diet is very similar to Paleo, but not the same; I noticed a few differences.  (For example, this book is for gluten free whereas Paleo is straight grain free.)<br /><br />I really think it would be worth combining this protocol with the one Byron Richards has in Mastering Leptin.  He goes very deeply into hormone work with leptin, insulin, gherin, etc.  He advocates meal spacing and not snacking, which really works wonders at taking away hunger.  (It seems that snacking on anything, even if it's celery, gets all the hormones going that need to be resting between meals.  Not good for leptin or insulin resistance, or for fat burning.  His is another phenomenal book.)<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book for everyone.  It contains so many different types of information that I think it will be helpful for everyone.  I consider myself very lucky to have run across this book; I am definitely going to buy more books by this author!
B000WTXD30|5.0|Obviously, only Elton John fans will buy this.  That being said, go on and buy it and you'll love it as much as I do!<br />It's great and a good value for so many hit songs.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I'm normally sceptical to help-yourself-books, but this book made a lasting impression on me.<br /><br />I found it through a published chapter on self-publishing, and bought it immediately after having read that chapter.<br /><br />It's a sort o book I'm considering buying 10 of, and give it to good friends!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Bought this when it was only $18.99. Awesome price for everything that is included. My daughter loved this movie and calls it Maria.
B000NVT0RU|4.0|The role of the World War II soldiers from the French colonies has been pretty much forgotten.  In that sense, this movie is a good history lesson.  Despite some imperfections the movie is worth including in film libraries.
B0042UEU8M|4.0|This movie was worth watching! The story was real and believable. I felt for the characters and got into the story quickly. Romantic and a little sad, Charlie St. Cloud still managed to surprise you in the end.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I have always loved listening to Slash but when you combine his talent with Myles Kennedy???  WOW!!!  This is some awesome music!
B001JI72AI|3.0|My mom convinced me to watch this and I'm glad she did. It was sort of boring, but I think that was just my perspective since it was an old movie for me.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great hidden picture game. Free download with in-app purchasing, but you can easily play and advance without spending real money.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|One of the best<br />Five star. This is the tenth book I have read and this was one of best.5 star
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I finished reading this book in 2 days....Mickey Haller is so damn good feel like I wanted to be a lawyer.  Love the courtroom dramas and how Mickey handled the arguments to prove the innocence of his client.  Michael Connelly did a really good job!!! I only have 2 favorite authors and he is one of them. This book was very well written, you'll keep guessing till the end of the story.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Loved how the author used all the favourite characters and developed them into young adults. Love the humour and the references to Percy's past. The whole story brought everyone together...Leo and Hazel, with Sammy being Leo's grandfather. Jason and Piper coming from the Roman side and having Percy and Annabeth to represent the Greek side.<br />Also about Annabeth's fear of spiders, then having to battle the mother of all spiders....amazing.<br /><br />Really well done, this whole series...I enjoyed it and highly recommend it to all young adults and older ones too.

B008S4FZHI|5.0|Have read all of Scarpetta books and will keep on reading them if new ones are written. It is like keeping in touch with someone you know
B009RX7WTI|1.0|I stopped watching season 9 after the third episode. I am so upset with how they handled the plane crash and recovery. I don't know who was responsible for putting it together but I wish that I could tell them personally how much I hated it. Plain and simple I was cheated. I felt nothing, no connection, no closure and no drama. How could you do this to us, to your fans? What a terrible let down.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Heard so much about this book and read it on holidays but it was just okay- most other people seem to like it better than me
B00755MHXG|5.0|I had to read this for my Children's Lit class at university. I was really touched by this book. The narrative was extremely clever and expressive. I have worked with young people for many years and I would highly recommend this book. This will be one I use in the classroom with students later on. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved it cant wait for them to make new rooms and even more harder ones. will try some of there other games while I wait
B000002KKC|5.0|The oddly titled `Tusk' released in 1979 was the third collection from the Mick Fleetwood/John McVie/Christine McVie/Lindsey Buckingham/Stevie Nicks line-up, and follow-up to the all-time best seller `Rumours'.  The album takes its name from one of the song titles, a punchy minor-key number featuring the University of California Trojan Marching Band which became a huge selling single.<br /><br />The original album was released on 2x vinyl disks (called a `double album' in those days) and as usual showcased the song-writing of Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie and especially Lindsey Buckingham whose fine compositions give the album its special flavor. The album notoriously cost more than US$1 million to record but sold less well than `Rumours' for reasons which caused heated arguments between the band and the record company, but has survived the passing years well and now occupies its rightful place as one of the iconic recordings of the 1970s.<br /><br />`Tusk' is more upbeat and less of a mellow listening experience than either the eponymous 1975 album or `Rumours' but still has its poignant moments, in particular Christine McVie's `Never Make Me Cry' and `Honey Hi.' Buckingham is in fine form and at the top of his game both as a songwriter and guitarist, and the rhythm section of Mick and John were never better than here (Mick Fleetwood is on record as declaring `Tusk' his favorite FM album). It's just a bit less instantly appealing than most of the band's output, but it certainly grows on you with repeat listening.<br /><br />The 2004 remastered version has the original album on one disk and a second disk of demos, alternate versions and bonus tracks which didn't make it to the original release.<br /><br />`Tusk' is indispensable not only for the FM fan but for all connoisseurs of fine rock/pop music. If you've never heard it, check it out: the songs will have you singing along with gusto in no time.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Given the material that they had to work with, this could have been a better movie but alas it was simply a way to pass a couple hours.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It's an amazing confirmation that we indeed create our reality. WOW, what a ride. Learn about your personal power in 9 experiments.
1419705644|5.0|Ok maybe not the best or the most in depth encyclopedia companion that i have ever read. It was defiantly funny and a must read for any fan of adventure time.
0920236162|2.0|I thought it was a dumb story. I just disliked the whole thing! I had heard about it on Pintrest and just went and bought it w/o reading first. Never again!
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I prefer to read the books then watch the movies myself the movies always change something and don't stick to the story line. But if you liked the book the movie will not disappoint and the parts in the book that had you laughing will have you &#34;LOL'ing&#34; during the movie.
B003MC5AV2|3.0|It was a cute summer read book. I think this is more focused towards teenagers though. I read it in a weekend.
B00EJKG5M4|5.0|When you buy this game it gives you everything for one low price including solutions and all levels unlocked which in this era is unheard of.  Really great game.<br />Jimmys9
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just like many reviewers, I'll review this before I've seen all of it based solely on my optimistic expectations.  What a great show (I expect this to be based on Season 1)!  Actually, I've watched two episodes.  Great stories, great characters, excellent music, excellent production values.  Also, great accents.
1609611543|4.0|Lots of good information in this book but not sure if I will follow it to the tee. Some maybe but I do love learning about different health issues and cures.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Cool game like that it uses all the suites. Also, to expensive maybe try lowering the price of the tokens people will play longer.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I chose this rating because it is an easy read book with powerful information. Recommended for<br />any person interested in enhancing their spiritual life's journey.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|With this particular offering the movie Oblivion in HD, i.e. high definition; I had a great viewing experience by looking at it on a Kindle Fire™. The movie was beautifully shot the plot was interesting and the acting was sufficiently engaging for the subject matter. I would recommend the movie, and viewing in high definition on the Kindle or even better my computer monitor system which is HD display compatible. Unfortunately previous offerings I have purchased and unsuccessfully attempted to view on my computer were not a good experience. So I will say that I will probably purchase a movie for viewing on my Kindle fire with high confidence my viewing experience will be reliably pleasant. We are looking forward to making a similar purchase for a different video products. I look forward to making such a purchase in the near future.<br />I will probably contact customer service for assistance in viewing streaming video on my latest computer running Windows 7 with a high definition display card and supporting monitors.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|This is a great game, but five dollars is really too much to spend on such a short game. I can buy an XBox game that will take days and days to play for just a few dollars more!<br /><br />That said, I am new to the world of game apps, and I am glad I have found the g5 games. They are amazing...at least most of them. I love this game because it is not just searching for hidden objects because that gets boring. I love the mini-games and puzzles. I also love having to hunt for items. The storyline is superb as well.<br /><br />All in all, this game would be perfect if it was 3 bucks instead of 5!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The sight has everything you need and is easy to maneuver. I use it all the time on my phone and on my Kindle.
B005N09L5C|2.0|Normally I enjoy John Hurt but this time it just was a painful experience.  The movie had moments where I thought it would pull itself out of the ordinary but quickly fell right back down.  This was a disappointment from the beginning.  It seemed the director was more interested in nude shots instead of the true meaning behind the book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Had ignored all of the good reviews and suggestions from friends to watch until recently.  I watched all 3 seasons in a span of 2 weeks.  I have never been sucked into a tv show like this one.  And season 3 is the best so far.  You really become a part of the survivor group.  Fantastic quality - acting, special effects, everything.  Watched an episode of Under the Dome recently, which I have also enjoyed.  But the quality doesn't compare.  There were a number of scenes where something just didn't make sense with Under the Dome.  Walking Dead doesn't let any of those &#34;mistakes&#34; hit the finished product.  Who would've thought a show about zombies would be of such high quality?
0812986180|5.0|I bought this book, because I saw the commercials for the show on Netflix.  It looked very interesting.  I'm really glad I did.<br /><br />It was a very heartwarming, insightful and poignant look into the women's prison system.  Having spent some time in rehab, I could really relate to this book and the lack of privacy and the lines, always a line.  It really brought back memories of my time there.<br /><br />I could really relate to the fact that she was out of her league as well.<br /><br />It was a very well written story and one that I really liked.  I will definitely be looking to watch the series which I am sure they will play up the daily life of living in a prison and the women who do so.<br /><br />Congrats to her husband who hung on for her, that is very commendable!!!
B000I9W08I|4.0|It was great to finally see the whole movie, instead of just clips. There was very little plot. But lots of songs. Lots of long songs, actually. Very stylish; gorgeous costumes; great singing; a bit of humor. I only watched to hear the Sunday Clothes song that I recently heard watching Wall-E, but I had to watch it thru to the end to enjoy the entire experience.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Fun and different little puzzler...you see a ball &#34;decorated&#34; in a certain way and you have to use the paints and &#34;tools&#34; provided to try and replicate it.<br /><br />Good game for playing anytime you have even just a few minutes and, because it's not timed, you can also play it while watching TV.
B00571F26Y|1.0|It is not worth criticizing To me it was another read like Atkins. If you followed the diet you will lose weight
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|This watch has the perfect size and a very classy look.  The great thing is that you don't have to worry about having to change the battery. The only negative is the band is a bit too narrow for the watch. But overall, it's fantastic.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is terrific. I just love the acting and story line. I enjoy each and every character and how they interact with each other.
B00EFNXPFK|4.0|It comes as no surprise that John's latest album reflects the same taste he gave us with born & Raised. He's clearly more comfortable now performing the same type of southern rock and country tunes he produced in 2012. Paradise Valley digs a little deeper than Born & Raised, and it's an obvious departure from the classic Mayer pop listeners are used to. His move to Montana might have had a deep, resounding impact on the simplistic flavor his songwriting has today, but it certainly hasn't affected his ability to write catchy, identifiable tracks; a trait he's always been renowned for. The laid back atmosphere is definitely a breath of fresh air. The ensemble of musicians on duty for Paradise Valley is smaller than it was last time, but the product is as strong, if not stronger.<br /><br />Paper Doll is the standout pop track sure to garner millions of radio listens and requests. Songs like Who You Love and Wildfire excel as singles with notable, memorable phrasing and melody to satiate Mayer fanatics and at the same time offer a familiar glimpse of his upbeat and tantalizing voice for casual listeners.<br /><br />The real gems of this album are the songs Dear Marie, I Will be Found (Lost At Sea), Badge And Gun, You're No One Till Someone Lets You Down and Waitin' On The Day. On The Way home gets props for being a solid closer that harkens back to latter Day \\"On Every Street\\" Dire Straits, but the former 5 songs are a beautiful representation of the 60s and 70s era rock/country that inspired them. Not only that, the lyrics are a personal reflection of John's life up to this point. They're a tell all of his recent experiences with the music business, his love life, and just life in general. I think he's always had reservations about the idea of growing older but admits with these lovely songs that as confusing, sometimes terrifying and generally odd it can be, he's definitely opening up to the idea. Still, at less than 40 years old John has a long way to go and so muchmore he can offer. He shows with his cover of Call Me The Breeze that jamming out and having fun is still a priority.<br /><br />It's clear that John hasn't lost touch with his fan base. This album offers just the right amount of classic Mayer pop that listeners are accustomed to and enough exploration, experimentation and guitar tomfoolery to entice everyone. It's impressive that an artist like him can transcend genres and create songs that can be both contemporary and representative of eras past...<br /><br />Mayer is the total package. He's a brilliant songwriter, trailblazer and performer. He's not caught up in any specific time period and is willing to tread new water in order to produce worthwhile material for his fans. Whether or not anyone enjoys it is completely up to them, but I say enjoy it. Paradise Valley is a must have for not just Mayer fans, but music fans in general.

B00AW0DM8K|5.0|Two voices, two perspectives, two cultures, two souls expressed by one author and so very skillfully. This book is a prize-winner.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Mud was amazing. It was a throwback to the old dramas taking place in the south in communities with few resources.  The kids did a good job and Mud couldn't have been any better acted. I could see why people loved him and why they got fed up with him. I would watch it again.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Was my favorite until the changes were incorporated.  Not user friendly anymore so can't rate as a five star as I would have previously.

B004ADF7RO|5.0|The Goonies.  What's not to like about this movie?  I must have watched this movie a thousand times, and it never gets old.  The part where Chunk is telling the bad guys about what he did in the movie theater is the best.  A winner.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Once again, Clancy has written a very engaging, timely story.  As a woman, I always get teased for reading books written primarily for men, but it is a &#34;ripped from the headlines&#34; piece of fiction that I find compelling.  I have read all of Clancy's fiction and hope he keeps writing!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|vaguely entertaining but wouldn't recommend it.<br />visuals were okay.  story was rubbish.  acting was okay.  directing was a bit annoying.<br />predictable pap, but sometimes thats okay.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|An excellent novel.  Good engaging format.<br />Characters well portrayed.<br />Recommend the novel to book clubs for good discussions.<br />Flower descriptions are excellent topics for conversations.
1481207474|4.0|Really enjoyed this one. At first, I would have said that I loved it. But I thought that the quality was uneven; the first half was amazing. It built up this intense, heart-stopping conflict between the hero & heroine. The writing was evocative, vivid and tight, and every scene delivered a punch to the gut. I mean, wow. Amazing.<br /><br />But if the first half built and built, cranking up the tension and the stakes until my heart felt like an winch about to bust, the second half...fizzled away all that tension. It loosened that conflict and devolved into a sort of episodic story, depending on silly contrivances and characters making sudden about-faces that I found hard to believe. The second half was good, above average anyhow, but it didn't leave my heart in my throat the way the first half did.<br /><br />So that's my quick resume. I'll try to unpack those conclusions.<br /><br />Our hero, Robert, is a duke with radical political views. He's very aware of his privilege, and he grew up with a father who possessed that same privilege and abused it terribly. Robert has developed into an egalitarian, a duke who believes the peerage is morally wrong, that all people should be treated equally. He sees himself as a mole, destroying the system from within. In THE DUCHESS WAR, he's traveled to Leicester in order to smoke out the identity of a brutal union buster who's fixed trials in order to protect abusive factory owners.<br /><br />Basically, Robert is a sweet guy. He has a strong sense of right and wrong, but he's kind of a dope. He does a lot of dumbish things throughout the book and it's built into his character. He's a bumbling idealist with a severe case of foot-in-mouth disease...really, if this guy weren't a duke he'd be, like, a shoe-in to play the adorable but wacky sidekick character on a TV drama.<br /><br />Our heroine, Minnie, is a savagely intelligent woman with a past. Her past is so scandalous, in fact, that she's changed her name to escape it. She keeps her head down, she makes no waves, she kicks up no fuss. It's slowly killing her to repress her true nature, which is bold and vivacious, but she bows to necessity. She is in a vulnerable position, she is poor, and she has no other options.<br /><br />No other options.<br /><br />That's what THE DUCHESS WAR does so well. Minnie is one disaster away from dropping out of the middle class entirely, and sweet, bumbling Robert has arrived in Leicester to precipitate disasters. Their romance is heart-wrenching because it is so sincere, because Robert really likes Minnie and means no harm, but Minnie is terrified of him. That's what it's like to fall into the orbit of a man who could crush her with a word. Every time Robert promises to take care of her, Minnie has to trust him with her whole future, and when Robert bumbles and makes mistakes...Minnie is the one who suffers.<br /><br />There was a moment, when Robert has oops! accidentally ruined Minnie's life, where I had to put the book down and walk away. I felt so badly for her (& she is a GREAT heroine, fierce and smart and damaged). But I was also deeply invested in the romance, which is a sweet, lovely thing that brightens a book that might have otherwise been unrelentingly grim, set in an industrial town with characters whose pasts are full of land mines.<br /><br />But the second half. Sigh. It's hard to say much without giving away spoilers, but once Minnie is no longer afraid of Robert, the book has no juice. And yet there's still lots of plot to wrap up, so the book sort of stutters along. Little conflicts pop up, but they're isolated and feel contrived--Robert's mother decides to make trouble, Minnie and Robert have some communication issues to sort out. The last 30% of the book or so felt really rushed.<br /><br />I picked up THE DUCHESS WAR because I've had uneven experiences with Courtney Milan's books. It was a last chance read; either I'd finish it a fan, or I'd stop trying. Despite the weak conclusion,Milan has won me over. There were just so many great moments, great lines, great scenes--I'l recommend THE DUCHESS WAR, and I'm going to keep going with the Brothers Sinister series.Milan has won me over.

B0011N1WE8|4.0|I like the characters and the premise of this movie.  The only issue that I have is that Penelope is all of a sudden a teacher at the end of the film, whereas that would take at least four years to accomplish (unless she did some kind of online degree from her room).  Kind of a random pet peeve, but all well.  :)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a must play game! Others who raved about the game wasn't joking! It's not only a blast to play but hysterical!
B00CFA227C|3.0|The movie had a good premise, but the ending felt rushed.  Te characters could have been developed a little more because when seem of them got killed by the giants I didn't care that much.

B00APH111U|5.0|Hard to believe this is the same guy who played the lead in Ace Ventura. Jim Carrey and the entire cast knock it out of the park on this one. One of our family's favorites.
140006922X|3.0|As an Atheist, I find the reviews here more engrossing that this book.  To read all the Christian claims that it is impossible for a Muslim to write a non-biased historical account of the god of Abraham mythology is well, a pretty biased claim.  What can you offer to prove that he is being biased, besides apologist opinion, feels and beliefs?  Seems like he did extensive research and came up with a decent piece based on the minute amount of actual real evidence of his life, if he existed at all.<br /><br />Now, if a Christian would do the same on Mohammad, then a Jew on Mohammad and Jesus...I would be able to watch an awesome war on the news media and when the dust finally settled from the awesome love that is the god of Abraham and his tribes....we could colonize space and do science without all the hocus pocus, hate and wars.<br /><br />I encourage both the followers of Christianity and Judaism to write such research books, complete with sketches of Mohammad and what not....lets get the Abrahamic love started, cause you just know two of the three are doing it wrong!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I bought the book and the DVD, then went back for more as gifts. A real winner and some great insights for young and old alike.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My favorite shows and books tend to include real life settings and characters.<br />Downton Abbey certainly does do that.  It gives us a peek at both the higher class, as well as the working class.  Neither group escapes troubles. Both use each other to gain helpful information.  It is great to see how much real caring takes place in spite of backstabbing.  Characters well suited for their roles.<br />I have already recommended this series to my friends and family.

B005DJ7E84|5.0|A friend recommended I see this movie.  I had never even heard of it but it's a great movie.  Claire Danes does an excellent job of portraying Temple Grandin.  Really gives you an in-depth view of what it's like to be autistic.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I LOVED the book. It shows that like with Ender, whenever we become weak and we fall down we can choose to get back up and get through the trials headstrong. I really enjoyed the book and want to read it again sometime.
B0000CABK8|5.0|I'm a moderately huge Star Trek fan and this boxed set of ALL TEN previous movies makes my DVD collection complete. I have watched all of them already and not a scratch, skip or blemish anywhere. Love it!

B0034DGPEU|5.0|The best book I have read in a long time, that is not a mystery.  It was one of those books you don't want to end.  i highly recommend it, you won't be sorry.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Great game but hard at first but on the first the first  real level click on the pencil and paper and type in giant rainbow glitter beaver or giant rainbow beaver. But don't get rid of the game you will get the hang of things sooner or later.
B000002C2E|5.0|Daniel Lanois, who produced the amazing 1989 album Oh Mercy, would return to work with Bob Dylan on his 1997 record Time Out Of Mind. A sound that is old school folk and blues combined with a little bit of elegant production value with songs about love lost and aging, the record is a little bleak with lyrics that can be depressing at times but there is a certain beauty in these songs that shows Dylan at his most bittersweet since Blood On The Tracks (1975). It's a wonderful record that put Dylan back in the spotlight after struggling to find his place in the music industry through out the 80s and early 90s. It ended up winning the grammy for album of the year. Most celebrated song here is the lovely \\"Not Dark Yet.\\" Other highlights include \\"Trying To Get To Heaven\\", \\"Cold Irons Bound\\" and \\"Make You Feel My Love\\", which was just recently covered by Adele. While some have rejected Dylan's records post Desire (1976), he has continued to write great songs with each passing decade in my opinion, his latest album Tempest is another masterpiece, and Time Out Of Mind is more proof of that.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|its a great game that I love to play. its fun and a stress relief. just try it once and you will love it too.
1451626657|5.0|Loved rereading it, a true American classic! Everyone knows what a &#34;Catch=22&#34; is, but you need to read this book to really appreciate the dark humor of it. Recommended for everybody!

0385333846|5.0|Everyone should read this classic. A valid commentary on war, in any time or place. Awesome! Loved rereading it! Recommended for everybody.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|It would be better if there were more floors. It wasn't so hard it frustrated me, but not so easy as to finish in no time.
B000FC13UE|5.0|Good collection of Gaiman's work, though I hate getting books with short stories I've already read in other collections. Still, if you like his work, you will not be disappointed with both the variety and quality of stories.
B008Y76VW2|3.0|Little to recommend this coming of age movie. General theme is fairly ordinary with a minimal plot.<br />A young adult, college dreams shattered, is forced to work in an amusement park in an attempt to earn college tuition. While working, he meets a girl of similar age - they seem to get along well, but she is in what's apparently a sex only relationship with an older man.<br />This conflict drives them apart, and (his) summer ends with thoughts that he'll never see her again.<br />Off to school in NYC, they meet again as the movie closes.
0470913029|5.0|This diet is the best way to shed pounds and never be hungry. I have been on it for 3 weeks and have lost 14 pounds. This method of eating and living with food is the only sensible way to achieve results for life. Nothing else has worked for me. Try it and you will not go back to your old way of living. This book gives you the reasoning behind the plan. It also gives you science to back it up. Since I am very numbers and facts based, this book helps me understand why it works. The scale is  proof it does.....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good fun and cute with fast paced twists, runs and lots of parts from the movie.  Great for kids and kids at heart
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So looking forward to season 4 both upstairs and down.  However, I will miss Matthew (Dan Stevens) and that lovely, velvety voice.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|The game builds up the usual horror tropes, like the death that demonstrates the rules of the game and the gradual revelation of why these characters are placed in the deathtrap. Although the game has lots of lighthearted humor, the bad endings maintain the horror elements of the game. But then you get the REAL ending and traditional storytelling goes out the window. Completing the game left me dumbfounded and intrigued. The real ending introduces lots of questions that are not explicitly answered, but the implied answers consider a more unsettling insanity in the game's antagonists.<br />That confusion does not deter me from enjoying the game though, since the protagonist is down-to-earth and almost whimsically dismisses the surrealism that comes his way. I really liked that when at the end and introducing the hard-to-explain, the game pretty much says \\"Whatever, here's some inconsequential side conversation.\\" The lack of seriousness makes the game feel freshly unique. Otherwise, if you want to stick with horror, just watch the bad endings.<br />The puzzle solving is easy point-and-clicking and introduces some interesting math problems. It might require some pen and paper, but each puzzle is confined to your current room, so solving puzzles is not hectic. My main problem with the game are the walls of text. Yes, I expected it, but I also thought there would be text speed options in a customization menu. (I also deducted points for the 4 crests puzzle near the end of the game. Why don't the numbers match?)
B0049H9NVW|5.0|During my search for cool board games to buy that me and my girlfriend would enjoy playing, I discovered Takenoko through BoardGameGeek.com and based on the pictures and game mechanics, I had to have a copy. I searched all over my city for one and none of my game shops had one. Of course, they could order one for me and it would have been $50 or so. I looked on Amazon and scored big for a new copy that only cost $39.99.<br /><br />The components are colorful and fantastic! The panda and gardener figures are already painted with precise detail as well as the plot tiles and cards. Some of the bamboo pieces fit too snugly, but there's so many of them, that you can find a piece that fits well to grow the bamboo garden. The game play is perfect for 2 players and when the game is over, the bamboo garden looks vibrant with all the various colored plots and bamboo shoots of various lengths sticking straight up.<br /><br />This is a wonderful game with a very cute theme that combines 3D figures and a light Eurogame style of placing tokens on your player board to take actions. The inserts are perfect to store all the components. The weather die is sometimes hard to read on certain sides, particularly the cloud, but after many plays, it's easily recognizable. This game is awesome! Don't be on the fence with this one. It's a clear winner. You can try it online at en.boardgamearena.com to learn the basics, but nothing beats seeing it in person.

B00E25KVLW|4.0|Very cool and affordable book. Smooth to read, simply pulls;)<br />Very clear examples and a good commentary. Pratical and useful
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I've read this book once before, but with the movie coming out on Wednesday, I decided to refresh my memory a little bit. Knowing certain aspects of the book already really helped me like it better the second time around. I don't want to give anything away, but trust me - everything is not what it seems.

B00669MFA2|1.0|Amazon glitched and will not show the movie.  I have it in my digital orders history, but I am unable to watch through the browser or Amazon unbox video player.  Thankfully I was using a $3 promo credit, but this has definitely given me no desire to use the Amazon video service in the future.

B007XNTDPA|3.0|Grisham has delivered another good piece of work. This is however not by far his best book.  The author should have added some more drama and interesting details.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing is inadequate to describe this novel.  I was in love with the characters and sobbed at my losses.  For the losses were mine, the investment too deep.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Some are going to find a lot of similarities between \\"Old Man's War\\" and earlier space military adventures like Robert Heinlein's troopers or Joe Haldeman's time dilation travellers. That's fair enough. But it seems to me that like Haldeman, Scalzo takes things to a (different, the next?) level by substituting genetic for mechanical engineering as his deus ex machina. It's not that there isn't lots of hardware in the story. There is. Even so, the story is at its best when demonstrating the profound differences that biology, including human brain power (albeit digitally aided), can make. Apart from all that this book was just a fun read. I would give this warning to anyone who gets it: you will not be able to put it down (OK, maybe *you* will, but most won't). So be prepared to set aside a day to be absorbed into it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is an amazing game it's almost as good as a SONIC game but I do have  one complaint about the game the super sneakers SUCK!Because every time I get this power up it kills my character and I can barely get any coins . But other then that this game is awesome.
B005LAII12|5.0|great film.  funny, at times dirty humor.  i'm from boston so there's lots of local humor.  fun to watch over burgers and a beer with friends.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|Sonic colors is awesome but not as good as SONIC CD. For a few reasons like the spin dash can be used ,tails is awesome in this game, and metal SONIC is a boss . The time travel thing is cool and I loved the Level design . So this is why I love this game so much.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Funny very entertaining movie for the entire family. With enough drama to keep the adults interested. Very good movie over all.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The book continues on with their life as they continue to be one. I enjoyed reading it and look forward to the next book
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|It really does convince you that love can happen again no matter what!!! I would recommend this to any romantic type person male or female!!
B00000IQW5|5.0|This movie makes you realize that death can happen so fast. However, it also expresses that you can love again.
B000FC130E|4.0|Mr Gaiman created a world of shabby beauty and grandeur. Playing on our fears of simply not making a bit of difference and falling through the cracks of life the story makes us understand that what truly matters and what we believe matter are vastly different things.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a superbly written and produced story of a family, very different from what most Americans experience, but still the interactions, the problems and heartaches are similar to many families.  They face these situations with grace and forgiveness, something we all need every day.  I have watched the whole series several times and look forward to series four.
B00EAI9CSY|3.0|It wasn't terrible, but I don't really remember what happened in it either. It was not even close to being as good as &#34;Interview with the Vampire&#34;.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great little game with nice graphics and challenging without being aggravating -- but it didn't last very long. Hope they open up some new levels soon!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I WAS INTRODUCED BY FRIEND. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO STOP PLAYING. ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT WHEN I HAD TO BUY NEW PHONE I HAD TO DOWNLOAD AND START NEW GAME.
B008602KQI|5.0|Fabulous adaptation of the book.  Great from casting to sound.  A winner for sure.  Would not show to children under 10.
B008US4PBY|5.0|I got this as a birthday gift that my 12 year old nephew asked for.  He said it works well and he loves it.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book taught me numerous things about life! It has a great story and teaches great principals!!! I hope everyone gets chance to read this book!
B0036EH3U2|1.0|I do not know why this show is popular. Centuries in the future and egocentric people all get together in one giant space ship. I just got sick of the fracking \\"F\\" word. This show must appeal to the jerk portion of our population. I do not want to offend viewers, but other than the  Capt. and Ms President all the others on the ship are dreadful people. The story line is pretty darn good, not up to Star gate atlantis but good. Sorry, I vote for the robots.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Loved the story line and the detail. It is one of the better games I have played in awhile. I'm a big fan of big fish games, can't wait to play part 2'
B0052EE3S4|5.0|While the singers voice is rough it has been for a long time still great , and  this is \\"Rock and Roll\\" and the show is awsome!!! I have seen every major release all the way back to the midnight movie from the eightys by AC/DC and the donnington concert which is awsome, but to see the entire infield at this stadium jumping at the same time will blow your mind . This would have been a dream concert to be at, having some two hundred plus concerts on dvd It easily ranks in my top twenty. The camera - HD work is some of the best I have seen from any concert in my collection . The song selection is very good some new and many oldies but kick a** songs.<br />I give a Rating of five tokes and one shot of your choice. Enjoy the show.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This game is awesome,and the best thing is that this game is about monkeys fighting for a monkey cup,but I win all the time,so it's pretty easy but that is my opinion.GET THIS APP
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Could have done without almost an entire portion of this movie. Interesting idea though.  Acting was ok, can't go terribly wrong with Morgan freeman.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|sometime hard to see symbols, slow to accept matches.<br />Could be bigger, but then maybe I haven't learned my Kindle since I just got it.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|i really dont know wat to say this game is like  this old game i had  and like can u escape
B00E8B1358|1.0|This was pretty bad, mainly because it was all over the place; confusing, etc. But if you must see it, make sure you see the first GI Joe movie.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Special effects are only getting better and better. Before long we will have interactive action to go along with the movie. Enjoyed it very much. Being stuck out in the middle of now where with no movie theaters to go to, I'm pick my movies carefully. Loved the action, special effect, and who can't like the &#34;ROCK&#34;.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The storyline is great! Love the actors, although some short-time actresses are not so good. Music and scenery are great.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Only half way into the album and already pleased with purchase. Would recommend to all other ffdp fans. The cover of the L.L. Cool J song might not be cool to others as much as it was to me.
B003V5CFV8|4.0|was good and had some moments. brought some comedy and gave an insight to what life was like during the depression era. would recomment it to others to watch
B0057VY45O|5.0|It's summer. There is nothing good on TV. One afternoon last week I had absolutely nothing to do. There was nothing on TV. There was nothing left on Prime wroth watching. I'd seen Suits promo on TV, it seemed pretty flimsy and poser-type. I also noticed the 5 star rating on Prime. But even with all these signs I'd always ignored this show. The promos really turned me off. I'm so glad I had nothing to do, nothing to watch. I ended up clicking this show and started watching. I think I was trying to hate on it forcefully at first. I hated myself for watching it. I started to like it but I tried to convince myself that it wasn't any good. I kept going \\"pfft, yeaaah, okaay. what! really? oh cmon. not funny at all\\". Before I knew it, I was running through Season 2!<br /><br />I don't hate it. Infect I love it and I'm more than happy to admit it. I think I'm in love, with Meghan Markle! Now I'm all caught up. I'm all suited up and waiting to watch the latest ep on air tonight!
B003TOMAPC|4.0|liked it as brought a different way to be a crime fighter without super powers. liked it and thought the girl was the star. would like to see the sequel to this
B00BNPUA5Q|1.0|Do not waste your money purchasing this app from the Amazon app store. The version they sell is never updated, and way behind the version sold on the Google play store. You will not get any help from the developers either. They could give a crap less if you are receiving what you pay for, as long as they get their money.  So, if you still want to buy from this developer, do it from Google instead. At the very least they have the latest update available.
B008602KQI|4.0|But close enough. Enjoyed Jennifer Lawrence's performance.  I am looking forward to seeing the other two books as movies.  Hopefully they will make them.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I didn't think the creators could sustain this level of writing for three seasons.  Happily, I was wrong.  The writing is exceptional.  The acting is flawless.  This season is every bit as good as the first two.  If you love period pieces as much as I do, this is a &#34;must see.&#34;  Though I loved all of the performances, I must give special kudos to Maggie Smith, whose snobbishness, laced with a bit of humor, is so entertaining.  Still, her portrayal does not rise to the level of caricature, but is a fully developed, well-rounded and believable character.. But in all fairness, all of the performances are marvelous. The one thing I did not like was the traumatic ending in the season finale.  What happened at the end was very disappointing.  Still, it did not in anyway detract from the quality of the show.  It was just a bit more realism than I wanted.  I highly recommend Downton Abbey. ,
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|I'm so addicted.  It has a great plot, even better acting. Can hardly wait for season two.  When is that, anyway?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I'm loving kindle for android.  I can read from my tablet and/or my phone with no bulky books to carry around...GREAT
B009WUAK2M|5.0|You know exactly what you're getting into with a movie like this...it's a great cast, you have to admit.  Chuck Norris makes a cameo.  We also have Bruce Willis back as Church, our CIA/NSA guy with the assignments no other team can handle.  And what about Jean Claude VanDamme?  Excellent.<br /><br />Yes, there are plenty of cliches, but they made me laugh.<br /><br />Arnold: \\"I'll be back.\\"<br />Bruce Willis: \\"You've been back enough. I'LL be back!\\"<br />Arnold: \\"Yippee-Ki-Yay!\\"<br /><br />It was a simple, mindless, fun movie.
B00005R24K|2.0|The movie was back in the day, so it was very stupid lol had lots of blood and guts, grossed me out
0060786523|5.0|This is a wonderful book and should be available to anyone who wants to read it. However, the paperback version of the book is bulky and the print is too small.  Everyone who loves this book: Please petition the publisher for a Kindle version!
B005544V6A|5.0|I loved it because is very real , actual, and the cararcters are so well presented. The dialogue is also well written.i am looking forward to see the season 3 on Prime. Apparently at the moment is not available.
B0052UYJDC|2.0|This did not inspire me at all. What inspires most of us to declutter is getting fed up with the stuff and wanting a clean organized environment. I read this free on my Kindle, which is why I gave it two stars.
B00AEFYRVO|5.0|Even the third time watching it we're almost rolling on the floor.  You're in for a funny crazy funny night.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|This series started out brilliantly, but then seems to have had a succession of mini-jump-the-shark moments that want to make you roll your eyes.  There are also so many scenes where otherwise worldly, intelligent, extremely astute characters must become utterly clueless and dumb about the goings-on about them, in order for the plot intrigue to develop.  These devices have now been used so frequently throughout the series that they've become predictable, and tiresome.  I'll probably watch the series to the bitter end, because it's fun in a cheesy way, but Masterpiece Theater it isn't.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I liked it.  Good movie to watch for a night where there is nothing else to do.  Good movie to watch just once though.
B009NY43NY|5.0|So sad it is all over. It almost felt like a review, revisiting past characters while following a new story line. At the end there was no where else to go although it seemed like some characters<br />could have books of their own like Barry or Hunter when he grows up. We will see.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Keep me intrigued though each chapter!  Always a surprise to the very end. It was hard to put the book down.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Just what I was hoping for----a mind-bending novel about time travel and the quirks there-in. Great character development; I feel like the characters were my friends. Absorbing. Lots of fun and thrills and also a serious side.
B005OMOKN2|5.0|A must item for the long travelers
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I love the Red Hot Chili Peppers and found Anthony's story very interesting and heartbreaking..  I always thought he was a poet not  lyricists. The book proved my right. Every song comes from his heart and what he has experienced in life.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Adorable. Touching. A nice read. I often found myself laughing out loud with this book. This man . Definitely had an interesting life.
B004306Y3U|5.0|I love all of the Big Bang shows.  One of my favorite all-time comedies.  I love the interaction of the group.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a portrait of a dark, disturbing and dysfunctional marriage.  What makes us chose the people we are attracted to?  What makes us stay when others would have flown the coop?  Can we really make our loved ones better people?  Gillian Flynn<br />Gives us a cunning tale of a marriage gone terribly wrong. The author provides many interesting twists of plot and<br />Character development with an ending I both love and hate.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Not sure what to say but I really like the app.  I have it on my tablet and it works great.
B00C061I3K|5.0|If you are a Daft Punk Fan, you wanna hear this one.<br /><br />Fantastic addition to you Daft Punk music collection
B007PVHMCG|4.0|But too tiny for my son...he got frustrated with pieces..but the prices amazon had on it was not gauging like the competition
B006TKP2B2|3.0|The premise behind this book is an excellent one.  Very thought provoking.  It brings up the questions we should be asking, but not in a forefront kind of way.  They take a backseat in the story, and I personally found that unsatisfying, and something like a cop-out. I thought the author's style was interesting and mostly engaging, but there were too many instances of things skimmed over, or left out, leaving the feeling that things were missing.  I think this could have been an astounding work, but fell short.  The ending left me unsatisfied, and overall I have this feeling like the author was on the edge of something profound, but missed it.  It is, however, thought provoking, and remains on my mind.  I actually recommend it for those who like 'thinkers', and you may get more out of it than I did.  When I chance to reread it, I may 'see' more the second time around.  So don't assume its bad, because its not, its good.  I mostly enjoyed it, and had trouble putting it down at times.  I say give it a shot.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I am rereading the full series now for the third time, as I wait eagerly for the next book to be released in 2014 . I enjoy it as much each time. I feel I know the characters as though they were my personal friends.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game is very addicting. I especially liked the monster truck until I started using the Mack Truck. Awesome game!!
B003U4ZOQ8|4.0|I love &#34;Lost&#34; so everything gets at least 4 stars from me.  The 4th season is basically about getting the &#34;Oceanic 6&#34; back to the island, and establishing Desmond as the key to the whole thing.  It was shortened by the writers' strike that year, but it also includes the best episode of the entire series (in my humble opinion), &#34;The Constant&#34;.  Recommended.
B009R659L8|4.0|Not the usual Mary Higgins Clark but very good. Has the twists and turns I have come to enjoy. Would recommend to everyone.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Although its nice to have an actual app for my kindle fire I am extremely disappointed with the many bugs. Even though my newsfeed is set to most recent it clearly is not sorted that way...often have posts from random days. Notifications don't show up right away and sometimes don't appear at all. I can clearly see on my pc that I have a notification but it doesn't appear through the app. Until things get fixed I just can't give it a decent rating.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|like the game but there's no way of earning free tokens you have to wait a long time to earn coins. That sucks
0062238868|5.0|Really enjoyed what Chris and his warfighters accomplished. God bless them, their families and all of US Vets. Semper Fi.....
B00AW57L96|5.0|I had never read a book by Liane Moriarty, so glad I chose to do so.  I couldn't put it down!  Thanks Liane
B005544TRQ|5.0|I was hooked on Covert Affairs and watched all three season and stumbled across Suits. I'm amazed and it's good, funny, interesting to see how the real rich lawyers think, use their money, and they are very good looking.  What a cut throat enviorment to work in a big law firm.  I know I could never do it, but fun to watch.  I wonder how do they find the time to look that good everyday and go to work.
B009GIPDQS|1.0|Disappointing. As j.g. admitted himself , a lazy job. No research, it probably only took an hour or two to write.  Plot 1/10, characters 1/10, suspense 1/10<br /><br />1 star.
0425252868|5.0|I originally purchased this book for a friend of mine as a gift. As soon as I started reading it, I knew it was something very special. The fact that these two pilots survived the war to go on and later find each other is nothing short of miraculous. It is a story that touches your soul. A view of both sides of the air war in WWII that you don't find in any school history books. I was truly shocked and inspired by the thoughts and feelings of some of these airmen on both sides and the humanity that was shown at times when killing was taught to be the goal. The depth of this book is indescribable and you must read it to understand its impact. I can not thank Adam Makos enough for sharing the interviews and this incredible story and can only hope that it will someday be a movie, for generations to come.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Great app. Great way to get free music and fun bids. Don't stop and think before you download. Hit install now!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent read! Jobs was a pioneer and Isaacson does an excellent job of capturing the real essence of Jobs character. Thought out the book, there are times when you love him and times when you question his actions, but In the end, you get a feeling for knowing the real man.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just got this game and I found myself playing it for hours! Its very fun to play when you have nothing else to do because the weaned changes every time.

159448385X|4.0|The rich imagery and emotional tapestry was nicely spun by the talented writer.  I savored every word crafted by the writer.
B000007UXS|5.0|Items that have come to its end. I really like it.<br />The items are good quality.I like it so much.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This is one of the most fun and surprising movies that I cant see enough. Especially Robert DeNiro who totally steals the movie. Wont give away any spoilers cuz it would ruin the fun of seeing it for the 1st time but, keep an eye on the cast since there are quite a few VERY famous actors in it that dont even have that big of a part.  It's fun!!!<br />Find it! Watch it! I hope you enjoy as much as I do!!
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|A wonderful array of artists and styles to enhance any yoga practice. Will be a perfect compliment to many yoga styles.
159463176X|2.0|This was a fine book, but it was not nearly as captivating as the Kite Runner.<br />I bought this in hardback just to read an exceptional book, and was disappointed.<br />The author did nothing wrong; this was just an ordinary story.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|This book was my required reading for school and overall, this was a great read. A few parts had me bored but push through them and you'll be hooked again. Definitely worth the read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A few reviews / readers did not like the ending, for me the ending was great.  Wouldn't change a thing. It did make me think that there are people that live their lives this way. Or the author researched such people.<br /><br />It is a dark read...no doubt about it, but I loved the unique writing style of this author.<br /><br />I will check out her other titles.
B009BJAPLK|4.0|I find this incarnation of Sherlock Holmes rather intriguing. The interplay between Holmes and Watson is interesting, as is Sherlock's whole demeanor.....I love the eccentricities. I am somewhat dismayed by the number of episodes, though. Must we wait another year for 3 more episodes?
0743243153|5.0|A book to be read by every human o being n earth. So much light is encapsulated within its pages to the point that it was a power station it would have easily illuminated every corner of the globe and still have more energy to power up all the black holes in our galaxy. Wish I had read it earlier in my life.
B009LDD54K|1.0|I saw it advertised in our local paper for $34.99 and I paid  $44.86 to Amazon for it.  I am a member of PRIME, free shipping, and if there was a price correction in the past on a preorder, I was always treated very well.  NOT SO on this.  I AM NOT HAPPY!!!  Packaging and delivery were great as usual but AMAZON, I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU FOR THIS.  ALSO FOR NCIS SEASON 10 --  SAME THING  -- found it in the local paper for almost $10.00 cheaper than what I paid AMAZON on a preordered item and my account has not been credited for any difference as has usually been the case.<br /><br />I AM DISAPPOINTED AND AM RETHINKING CONTINUING WITH AMAZON. I HAVE BEEN A FAITHFUL CUSTOMER FOR YEARS!!!!!!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|My daughter is crazy about everything that Cassandra has written. Now I can see why. I even had OMG moments. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|Very well written!!!! I love the series but I really hope Jace isn't her brother so they can be together. I won't lie it's kinda gross thinking that they are brother and sister and they are in Love!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Excellent story, excellent acting, and since we lived in the South for several years, I would say it's quite true to reality there.
1936719118|5.0|Most people are followers and copycats.

I don't usually read often but he has a way of grabbing my attention. haha, Thanks' Derek.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I never watched the series on PBS. However, when I had the opportunity to watch it on prime I thought I would giv it a try.  Now I can't wait for season four to start.
0143034901|5.0|With The Shadow of the Wind, Carlos Ruiz Zafon proves that sometimes you really can judge a book by its cover.  That was, after all, how I came to discover this book and I am exceedingly glad that I did.  Before I was even halfway through it, I had already pretty much formed my opinion: The Shadow of the Wind is an incredible story with beautiful prose from one of my new favorite authors.<br /><br />The story has a flow to it that is more similar to classics such as [[ASIN:0143106651 Little Women]] or [[ASIN:1843440717 Pride & Prejudice]], in that the story takes place over ten or so years of the main character's life.  We start with Daniel as a ten year old boy and proceed to learn about his life over the next ten formative years.  Due to this, by the end of the book, the reader feels very familiar with the main characters having watched them grow.  I for one was sad to see it end, but the ending itself is very satisfying (back to that later).<br /><br />The characters are very original and very enjoyable.  The main character Daniel Sempere is a very likable narrator.  He begins the book as a wide-eyed, naive boy who loves reading and becomes entranced with a girl ten years his elder.  We watch, wince, and smile as he learns more about life through his experiences.  Fermin Romero de Torres, who serves as Daniel's best friend and a strong secondary main character, provides a great source of comic relief to the otherwise serious story.  I think I always had a smile while reading his lines and on many occasions, laughed out loud.  Bea is a very strong female lead in a book with several strong females including Nuria Monfort, Penelope, and Clara.  One other character worth mentioning in this strong cast is Gustavo Barcelo, who is an eccentric bachelor and avid rare book collector and always provides interesting dialogue.<br /><br />One problem that I have with many books is the ending.  I can't count how many books that I've ready that have been nearly ruined for me due to the weak conclusion/ending.  Luckily, that is definitely not the case here.  The ending of The Shadow of the Wind is satisfying in every way imaginable.  It wraps up the story perfectly, answers every question, and leaves you feeling completely contented.  The only other book that has had this effect on me was The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, which is pretty lofty company in my mind.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is patient enough to read a story that isn't non-stop action but beautiful and intriguing every step of the way.e to the weak conclusion/ending.  Luckily, that is definitely not the case here.  The ending of The Shadow of the Wind is satisfying in every way imaginable.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent story.  It started a bit slow but picked up the pace and I couldn't' put it down.  I would recommend the book to all who love mystery.
B00B9ZBZ2C|4.0|I don't think I was really prepared for Child 44.  I first heard about it several years ago while reading user reviews on Amazon for [[ASIN:B0095H4FAA The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo]].  One user had commented that it was the \\"best book of 2008\\", so I decided to look into it.  After the first few chapters, I had to stop and think about what I was reading.  The sheer brutality and unfairness of Soviet Russia was absolutely staggering to me.  I'm 31 years old, and I grew up during the last few years of the Cold War.  You would think that during that time, we, as American children, would actually be taught something about our fiercest rival.  But, I honestly don't remember ever even learning about Russia until college and only then as part of World War I and II.  It's really shocking how little we learn of foreign countries here outside of England, France, Italy, and (possibly) Germany.<br /><br />Anyway, after I started to accept the Soviet way of life in my thinking (not really accept, just understand), I was able to continue and I was treated with a real gem.  Leo Demidov and his wife Raisa are two excellent characters and what's even better is their relationship with each other.  What at first appears to be a loving, committed marriage is turned completely on its head not too far into the book.  Redemption is one of the major themes running through this book and it is pulled off wonderfully and really helps to give depth to both characters as well as their relationship.<br /><br />Looking back, the mystery alone isn't a hard one to solve and if the story had taken place in America or England, then it would have been a very basic, run of the mill thriller.  However, the added dynamic of the Soviet view of their \\"perfect society\\" and their general nonacceptance that murder is even possible, added to the lack of fairness involved in all facets of the government, really changes this story completely.  Every piece of information gathered, every interview, every clue isgotten through sacrifices and secrecy; nothing comes easy.<br /><br />My only possible criticism is the identity of the killer and his motive.  While it does all fit and provides a nice, WTF moment, it does seem a little too coincidental and the story would have worked fine without it.<br /><br />Regardless of this though, I cannot recommend the book enough.  I'll definitely be looking into the sequel, [[ASIN:B0058M76B6 The Secret Speech]] after I've finished a couple other books.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It was hard to believe Grey was as young as he was, and also hard to believe he could ever get any work done to be so successful in business with his sex life seemingly his only focus. Still, I will certainly have a hangover from this book.
B005DJREJS|4.0|Trials and tribulations of high school, friends and family played well. I laugh constantly. Jenna is a good little actress!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I have to play at least twice a day.  I believe every game can be won IF you try it enough times!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had neglected watching this when it premiered and regretted that after hearing so much about it from so many people. FINALLY borrowed seasons 1-3 on DVD and had an absolute feast over a one month period. It became my dessert after seeing what  drivel is on TV lately. I enjoyed it so much that when I got my new Kindle with Prime, I immediately watched season 3 again. This is drama as it was meant to be written, acted, and enjoyed by anyone with an IQ above a shoe size. This is not for intellectuals, just people who prefer period pieces to reality stupidity! The cast is superb and the story line will entrance everyone from teen to dowager.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I did  not like the ending. Were both  killed or just one??  Then, which one?? It was good, though. Really.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Interesting twist to an old kids tale.  I liked the special effects and if you take it for what it was intended for - entertainment they I think you will enjoy the movie as well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love love loved this book. The end totally pissed me off though.  But I would absolutely recommend it anyway. Excellent writing style..smart, fun, thrilling. Love.
B002ZG981E|4.0|Really cool movie that has a great transfer on Blu-ray. If you're a fan of the movie or like crazy futuristic/alternate movies, you'll like this one!
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|While I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, (and will be going this week to see KA2) I believe that the language could have been toned down a bit.<br /> It was also one of the bloodiest films I have ever seen, but it was a LOT OF FUN!!
B002ZG99A4|4.0|It's got all the greats (except Michael Jai White) and if you want to see the rest of the big-names you can watch the sequel. Pretty much cut-and-dry - just an all-around awesome action movie with all the cheesiness one could expect! ;D
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was very good, diabolical plot...ending was very off, disconnected...not jaw dropping like I expected....A good read but not my favorite book of the summer.
B001992NUQ|5.0|If you like this movie, the Blu-ray edition is fantastic! Due to the quality of filming (and all the effects) the Blu-ray transfer comes out very well. If you have never heard of this movie, but it anyway. this is in my top five of all-time!!!
B008M87GJK|5.0|Especially for free. I like their thumbnail + title method of presenting things, separated by their news types. Makes going through quickly for highlights easy and fast, and still browsing-friendly when you have more time. Kudos!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|A perfect Blu-ray movie! If you like sci-fi or are a fan of the movie, definitely get the Blu-ray version.
0920668372|5.0|I love this book.  I grew up listening to it as a kid and am very excited to be able to share it with others.  It is very caring and shows that unconditional love can truly exist. Would definitely recommend. Great for bedtime reading.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This was a surprise for me. I bought this on a whim and it turned out to be really good. Also, this movie is great on Blu-ray. I think it's because of all the special effects in the film. A very brilliant unique film. Might seem a little childish or silly if you're not a gamer or familiar with '90s and later culture.
B000YABYLA|5.0|This movie is hilarious. It is a great movie to veg out to at night and on the weekends. I could not stop laughing the first time I saw it.
B008645YEE|5.0|I love this soundtrack.  I've pretty much like all of Hans Zimmer's stuff, and this is no different.  If you like Batman and you like movie scores, you should get this one.
0307719774|4.0|Overall I really like it.  Some of the questions are very thought provoking while others only require one or two words to answer.  Good for people who don't typically keep a journal.  Only complaint is that there is not enough space to write some of the answers.
B00008ACIN|2.0|TWO STAR RATING is for POOR SOUND QUALITY not ALBUM REVIEW! DO not buy this expensive import. Just wait for the superior sounding 2013 $30.00 domestic 2LP set that comes out in a couple of weeks on Amazon. The new U.S. LP version is remastered from the same source as the RSD colored vinyl release from a couple of months ago and that was reported to be a big winner in the sound department!
B0006J28MI|4.0|Very cheesy and hard to believe but a good movie to veg out to on a night in. Liked it.
B00CKY0KJU|5.0|Even if you already own a copy of this classic on wax you owe it to yourselves to pick up a copy of the new vinyl remaster from Rhino as it sounds night and day better than the harsh original LP.<br />I've got two copies from the 1980's a 1st pressing and Quiex test pressing. Both sound very bright and annoying compared with this newly remastered Rhino LP version which adds extra bass weight and detail to the mix while avoiding the harshness of the originals. As a result I listened to both sides two times in a row back to back for the first time in my life. Also a word of warning there is a cheaper European pressing being sold by some of Amazon's sellers for much less than the retail price of $29.99! Please be careful and enquirer whether the LP you're ordering is from Rhino or not. If not or seller doesn't reply don't buy from them as I was recently ripped off by one of Amazon's biggest sellers,(my fault for not asking questions before purchasing).
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I read this book 36 years ago and still it makes me laugh (scare all the little pigvigs) and cry (Hazel at the very end). I feel like it has informed my knowledge of rabbits and outdoors and of course, love and loss, life and death. I think this should be required reading in school!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Not as exciting as the series but probably more like the authors real experience. Has very little background of her fellow prisoners. A good preparation for someone being sentenced to a minimum security womens penitentiary. A much better ending of the book versus the series.
B00E66QPCG|5.0|I'm new to futures trading and although the ebook talks about different markets to trade, I was really looking for a futures strategy that I could practice and get comfortable with. Aside from the rules which are pretty easy to follow, I loved the resources chapter. This section might not be as important for a more experienced trader, but for me this was exactly was a HUGE bonus.Hearing &#34;What to expect&#34; really hit home with me. We all know trading isn't as easy as people make it out to be, but with realistic expectations that I can shoot for, I feel better about working with this method. Although I'd recommend this eBook to any trader, the layout is very appropriate for the beginner to intermediate level trader in my opinion.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|Oliver Stone has never made a bad movie that I have seen.  This lives up to my expectations.  Kevin Costner is BRILLIANT, and the rest of the cast is perfect.  Great American cinema.
B003LQ3YXU|1.0|Me and my daughter wanted to check out what all the hype was about with this show and sorry we could not even get through the Pilot. Did not interest us.If you want a real show watch Breaking Bad or Walking Dead !!!! Oh Yeah!!
B001XUPGLY|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies with the original cast it was funny and action packed. Well worth watching if your a star trek fan...
B00ECUARO8|2.0|It has potential but it never fully developed. It was really disappointing.  The main characters were never fully developed and plot unclear.
B0094LUH4A|3.0|Good movie but more of a girl movie then a guy... Still entertaining and worth seeing. Don't watch it to late you might fall asleep...lol
B008CLI4N4|5.0|You will either love GOT or not love it.  Very violent, very very sexual at times, but for those who choose to believe that this is a real depiction of those times, it pulls no punches attempting to give you the untamed version.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I've been searching for a long time and this is the best free horse game I've found.  It lets you do everything in the games without having to pay money.  So far I haven't found a locked area and there is no payed version of the game.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This is an amazing show with amazing production value.<br />I could watch it all day!<br />Recommended to any fantasy fan.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved this book! Such a great plot twist. Just when I thought I had it all figured out Gilliam Flynn dropped a bomb on me!
B00BEYYEE4|5.0|This was a very enjoyable movie and as always Mark did a great job. Recommend it to any movie fan.
B009GED3HS|4.0|It will be hard for the 9th season to live up to the story arc here. Still fresh after all these years.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|This movie will go down a the classic western of all time. One of the most enjoyable movies I've continue to watch over and over. Loved it and highly recommend it to all movie and Clint fans.
0062278096|4.0|Glad to have this companion book. There's a lot to read and it's really cool seeing the sticky notes between the two main characters.
B000JBWWQ0|2.0|Bad acting. Not much of a story. Hard to follow. Boring. Movie did not make much sense. It was to long.
B006K1IIHA|3.0|So, only the text and sound comes thru on my MagnavoxBlu-ray player.<br />What should I do? Would love to keep the blu ray because I'm so happy to own it. In an alternative method, watched on laptop which can only show season one.<br /><br />Help please?
B0044WSF5M|5.0|They definitely don't make movies like this anymore. Things seemed so simple and care free in those days. If only teenagers now a days were amused by cruising down the street and eating at a hamburgar joint. Everyone is way too caught up with social media and do not no how to enjoy the little things in life.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app can check everything about the battery.... there is nothing else to say. Random word random word random word random word random word random word random word random word random word random random word random word random word random
B008HJGPVO|3.0|THIS STYLUS WORKS GREAT ON MY KINDLE FIRE HD. GVE IT 3 STARS ONLY BECAUSE I FELT LENGTH OF STYLUS  COULD BE ANOTHER 1 TO1/2 INCH LONGER. iF  6&#34; i WOULD GIVE IT A 5 STAR RATING  iT WOULD PROBABLY BE  AN INCH TOO SHORT FOR A MANS HAND
B00065JTBA|5.0|I love it. It's great. If you are a BJ's fan or not you have to buy this product. It's essential
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you liked Madmen, if you liked How I met your mother, and if you liked White collar (especially white collar), you'll love Suits.  I'm literally addicted to the show now; I blew through the 1st two seasons of it on Amazon Prime only to find myself crying when I realized Season 3 wasn't available yet.  Give the show a shot, if the pilot doesn't grab your attention, you probably don't enjoy comedy or good shows...haha no but seriously, its a good show, give it a shot.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I think it drags you in and makes you think. I've played the game over and over, now I just need the 2nd one.
0393317552|5.0|Having a degree in European History I am always interested in the events of society not only kings and battles.  The people and their evolution make history so exciting.  Should be taught in highschool.  Students would not fall asleep the way history is being taught in these days.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is sad but it turns out good in the end and may not look interesting but it's a AMAZING BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DPY95D6|1.0|I'm sorry, but I found this book long and cumbersome. It was an over-detailed story to nowhere. I'd like to see more of a story about what is going on besides brushing your teeth, combing your hair, driving somewhere. Boring, Boring, Boring.
B00E3UN59Q|1.0|Season 3 does not exist. There is only 2 seasons. Do not trick people like this. It is not ok.<br />End of story.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was an outstanding read. I was expecting this to be a mediocre story that would help get me through a 12 hour plane flight, but I ended up falling in love with it. Definitely recommended.
B00A285OOW|3.0|I'm a Philippa Gregory fan but this one's a bit tedious. Seems very repetitive - same info is presented again and again. My only motivation to continue reading is I keep \\"hoping\\" something will happen to engage me. Overall a big yawn.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Very good season, every chapter has its unique story, I always enjoy the Kalinda character, it seem that she does a very interesting daily taks about investigating others.<br /><br />For the ones that loves detectives trama, go for this season .....
B001FVV2X2|5.0|If you haven't indulged...you won't believe what you've missed!  From the perspective of a writer, a sci-fi fan and a chess player, this series is exceptionally exciting.  Expect nothing less of JJA; what in the world (or alternate world) will he create next???
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My pre-schooler LOVES this game!!  In fact he loves all of the Dr. Panda's games.  They are tons of fun and he learns in the process.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is timeless. Even though I've only listened to it via the CD once (The rest of the time is on my ipod or computer), I'm glad I have it. This will be one of those CD's that's remembered 20-30 years from now as being an all-time great and it'll be nice to have the CD in it's physical form. I'm considering buying the LP just to have even though I have no way to play it.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|Star Trek with its crew cast and stories recognize the currents of the era it was made it. Combine that with a red shirt and you have a winning combination!!
B008NQZK08|4.0|My wife thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  She recommended it to others.  She enjoys  movies with Tina as well.  Thanks!
B002ZBJ6SY|5.0|Well composed,  lyrically strong album with great riffs and beats.  Some of the best music I've heard in a while.  Great live act to see as well.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Season 2 is definitely better than the first season with more character development and the episodes are better written. If you are a Stargate or sci-fi fan, this is a must see.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Great graphics, improved interface, makes mtg 2014 much better than its predecessor. Looking forward to the expansion. Sealed deck is a very nice addition for those who want to experience building their own deck.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love this game! It's so addicting! It's so fun thanks for inventing it! It's so cool you should sell it more
B002RI97IY|5.0|I am finding this the most informative book I have ever read. I am anxious to get it to every person on the planet. All by itself it could end the misery encountered by so many. Simply awesome.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game I love to play it but at first I didn't know what to do. It needs better instructions. This game takes ages to load.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great T V series. Can't wait for season 4 to come out for free on Instant Prime! Thank you AmazonPrime.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good game for hidden object gamers alot of mystery too.<br />Highly recommended.<br />Best game of g5 in my opinion.<br />Hope you will like it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'm very happy with this app until recently I was opening it in a browser. This is far easier and easy to navigate.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Only problem was poor video quality on the Roku.  Not sure what the issue is a lot of the time on VoD there's a HD program that slows to SD or even worse.  Never have this issue on the fruit version....
B00CDUVDEC|4.0|You got to love this music, little bit Pantera, Superjoint, very hard, fast metal, he's very angry on this solo cd, if your a fan, get this cd!!!
0062255657|1.0|I submitted this as a choice for our book club.  I read  it a few months ahead and went back to the book club and withdrew it.  It was nothing more than a chlren's book with an adult theme thrown in.  It was wwird as can be.  Thansk goodness it was only a few hundred pages!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just got this app a while ago, and I think I am going to play it all day, ie would get it if I were you
B0053TWVDC|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie and I finally added it to my collection!  Great cast and performance!  Creepy and scary!!  :)
1475143389|5.0|This book should be considered the bodybuilding bible. It's filled with great information from cover to cover. I have read it a few times already, and I understand the processes in the body and nutrition a lot better. Like mike says I've already added 2 lbs every week during the past few weeks while increasing my lifts by 5 or 10 lbs every time I lift.<br /><br />It's a no BS guide to getting big. Just listen to the advice and don't listen to amateurs.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie so I finally decided to add it to my collection.  This original is better than the remake.  I love the cast and they give a great performance!  :)
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is by far one of the best games I have ever played. The steering is kind of hard but the fun overcomes that.
B00005K3NR|5.0|I love this movie!  I am glad I made this purchase and can say I have this in my collection!  The new version has nothing on this version!  It does not even come close in greatness to this version!  :)
B0098460O4|5.0|What a beautiful blend of voices.<br />Hopefully we will hear more from them in the future.<br />This is REAL music by truly talented people,
B000FZETIO|5.0|Great cast and great romance!  The music is wonderful as well as the story!  Love it!!  It is just as good as I remember it when I first saw it years ago!  :)
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I'm &#34;only&#34; about 5 - 6 hours into the supplemental materials, but so far I'm more than impressed. The picture quality is pretty great as well.  I wish other great film series got this kind of blu ray treatment.
B0033B5XCS|5.0|I always loved the original Nightmare on Elm Street and so decided to add this collection to my collection!  I enjoyed all of the movies, but the first is the best.  The remake is not as good as the original!  :)
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|Lots of fun...I can beat it once in awhile...LOL..you have to give this a try..you will not  be able to stop
B002VWNIDG|5.0|I love the book and movie!  Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors!  This movie has a great cast that gives a great performance!  I am glad I have this movie in my collection!  :)
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|this is a fantastic game and I highly reccomend it to people of all ages. this version has similar qualities to the other two versions, (quell and quell reflect) but Irs newer it better and highly reccomend to anyone
