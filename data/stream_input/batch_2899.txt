B009JZSC9S|5.0|Just finished watching The Good Wife Season 4 on Amazon Instant Video. This show is addictive. I just went through 22 episodes in about 1-1/2 weeks. Thank god because Season 5 starts on September 29 on CBS at 9 PM.

B0052RDHTM|3.0|A \\"project\\" to finish, but definitely worth it. Very enjoyable.<br />I recommend it highly for an international look into early twentieth century history.
0143034901|5.0|I read a lot of books, especially mysteries or suspense. This is one of the best books I have ever read. It was very well constructed, and the descriptions of life and the challenges the characters faced was amazing. I highly recommend it.
B00CFA222M|4.0|I bought this movie on a lark and found out that it was pretty enjoyable to watch.  Don't try to look at this as an extension of the original story or as a re-write.  Enjoy it for what it is.  A nice stand alone story.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This movie was well done. The story is good, the acting was good. Whether you like him or not, Tom Cruise fit the role. Good twist in the story. Any Sci-Fi fan worth their salt would agree, good story, good movie. If you like Sci-Fi, this is for you. I did not comment on the movie to avoid spoilers.

B001NLL93W|5.0|Okay, I am hoping that the trilogy is made into MOTION PICTURE plus the prequel which I'm wondering if I should read prior to moving on to the third of Mortal Instruments. Like I said in my review prior to this, I AM Obsessed with this trilogy. EVERY chance I get to pick up my kindle and read more is like having an addiction. I love the modern nuances and references giving the story it's comedic edge. CASSANDRA CLARE is my new favorite<br /> author.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|I can totally relate to the way the characters/groups relate to each other in the IT team. This is an excellent way to introduce Lean, Kanban, etc. and how Change management can be effective and useful.
B000SNW0HA|2.0|This is not good. Sophmorish at best. Sounds like my little nephew could do it on an 8-track. You know that!
B00D7NRHX0|3.0|It felt like the movie just dragged on...not sure why.<br />The acting was alright, but I wasn't really invested in either main character.<br />It just didn't hold my attention, but the effects are decent.
B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|Entertaining movie, but plot seemed a bit weak. Also the dialogue was a little awkward at times. Didn't really feel like the movie had a real climax.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|this is one best medevil times moive flick I seen in a long time hope this more to come ok
0547564651|3.0|As an educator, I was excited to read this book. I was disappointed, but only because I read this book looking for answers in how to help my students who came from very challenging home lives. The student subjects in the book were followed, and I guess I was looking for more substantial research to apply to a wider range of student backgrounds. I found myself arguing with many of the &#34;answers&#34; to student success the author suggested, as I was reading from the educator's perspective. I wanted proactive tools, but the book offered vignettes and looks into mothering. The book is well written and interesting if one is looking for a cursory clue into student resiliency, but I was left wanting more.
B004CURZFC|5.0|This is a great movie! The artists did a awesome job with the rendition of the owls in this movie. Spot on. Would like to see a sequel.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This show is just too funny. I can see it again and again and it does not get boring at all.
B001F6TXME|5.0|While in DC on the 4th. Taking pictures of the fireworks the release worked great. Able to shoot pics without touching the camera with can cause problems with the clarity of the shot being taken. I stood to the side of the camera and took shots that came out great for a beginner like me.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|it was really fun it showed my new hair styles but it got boring after a while and it didn't have a lot of stuff
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|If you want &#34;visually stunning&#34; but don't worry too much about plot and character development--this is the movie for you. It was kind of like a lot of film plots put together, shaken up and laid out which is a shame since there were some wonderful actors like Morgan Freeman and Michael Cain but they had little to work with.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|it was supper boring it was always making me do step bye step and I thought it would just let me do my own thing but it didnt
B007PF7MGS|5.0|If only I had discovered this nutritional information a decade earlier...it is the missing puzzle piece to dietary information for me!  The knowledge imparted within each chapter is a step in the right direction for not just me, but for every man, woman, and child accustomed to the standard western<br /> diet.  It is a wake-up call, shining a light on food choice as well as on the bigger picture- I pray I see the day that all people finally understand what it will take in order to save our lives, our wallets -- and ultimately our wonderful blue planet itself. The choice to consume animal products, as Dr. McDougall stated, is not just personal.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I really liked it I even challenged my brothers and sisters to play with me to see who would win.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Look at the line up........you have to really appreciate the 80's puns and some 21st century explosions. Worth the watch.
B008476HBM|5.0|My sister and I really love this book so much because of everything that happens and the romance and comedies.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|This is the third revamping of the General Zod storyline. Superman, Smallville and now this. Alex Ross redefined Superman in the comic books and Henry Cavill is obviously designed to fit the image. The problem is that none of the characters are particularly likable. Perry White (Lawrence Fishburne) is now black. Well, I guess that's okay because now the green Lantern of Earth 2, Alan Scott, has come out as being gay in the comics. (Please DC, don't make Robin a victim of child molestation by Bruce Wayne just to be politically correct and honor the memory of Dr. Frederick Wertham, who said as much decades ago in his book, Seduction of the Innocent). All of the performances in Man of Steel seem soulless and wooden. CGI ridden, writing deficient, I felt like I was watching Transformers II. I did not care much for Zod either. Callum Blue was far, far better.<br /><br />The General Zod storyline didn't really emerge as anyone of significance in the Superman arc until 39 years after the legend began with the first Superman movie, which appears somewhat cheesy today, but there's no excaping the fact that Christopher Reeve made Clark Kent human. Warner Brothers then went and took the evil Zod and turned him into Jor-El when \\"Smallville\\" was made with Terrance Stamp playing both characters. Lest we not forget that \\"Smallville\\" also had Clark's girlfriend become Clark's earth mother and his cousin, Kara become his Kryptonian birth mother, leaving one wonder whether Smallville is really somewhere in Kentucky. The fact of the matter is that Zod is not that interesting a character, and why are we made to suffer through a rehash of a storyline that we know the outcome of? At least, Callum Blue added dimension of Zod's character. Henry Cavill's Zod is just angry all the time.<br /><br />Before DC writers went insane, science on Krypton wasn't that advanced. Krypton didn't have any space travel and the rocket in which baby Kal-El was sent to earth was a prototype. Krypton exploded,because of uranium core that fissioned and Jor-El was a respected scientist, as was Zor-El, his brother. Krypton wasn't in some other galaxy. It was in the Milky Way, and when it exploded, two parts of it had survived: Argo City, which came off as a huge chunk, which continued to revolve around Krypton's sun, and Kandor, which had been stolen, people and all, by Brainiac, who turned out to be a robot, who went around collecting cities from various planets and displaying them in bottles. After Krypton blew up, every bit of ground in Argo City turned to kryptonite, which shouldn't have affected non super Kryptonians, but for some reason it did. Fortunately, apparently, there was a sheet lead factory on the outskirts and Zor-El was able to direct the survivors to roll out tons of it to cover every bit of land, as others  worked furiously to make use of the plastic from the plastic factory to create a huge bubble to hold in the atmosphere. Rockets were later installed underneath the planet fragment (from the steel factory) and with fuel from the jet fuel refinery, propel Argo City to our solar system, which all of the Argonauts gained superpowers. Zor-El, idiot leader, decided this was bad, so back they rocketed to Kryptonian space until around fifteen years later, there is a meteor storm that smashes the dome and using the only other rocket prototype, Zor-El is able to send his only daughter, Kara, to earth, where she becomes \\"Superman's Secret Weapon\\". As the only other survivor from a dead planet, Supes should have mated with her to renew the Kryptonian race. Forgetting the fact that she was only 15, it was the Kentuckian thing to do. But, he had this thing going for the idiotic earth woman who drove him nuts trying endlessly to destroy the one thing that gave him some measure of peace, his secret identity. Let's not even try and figure how a man with superpowers can have sex with an ordinary person or how his super-sperm didn't blast right through her. On the Tonight Show, Johnny Carson asked Margot Kidder how this was made possible. Kidder, kidding, said that Lois Lane used a kryptonite coil. Or maybe it was the fact that Zor-El and his wife escaped at the last minute into the Safety Zone, a Phantom Zone-type dimension that Zor-El had invented. (several questions: why didn't Jor-El save all of Krypton by projecting them into the Phantom Zone or at least his own family? Or why didn't Zor-El do the same with the Safety Zone. And when Argo City blew off, how was it that there was enough gravity to hold everything and everyone to the planetary chunk? Well, all this took place long before we were all savvy to such things and knew how yellow sun radiation can cause Kryptonians, apparently all built from transuranium elements, to gain superpowers.<br /><br />The point being that Brainiac was a far more interesting adversary than Zod, as was Metallo, a criminal, given a robot body with a uranium-powered heart that he eventually switches out for kryptonite (hmmm, did Stan Lee steal this concept for Iron Man and a later steal for Robocop?) or the Parasite, a man who gained superhuman strength by absorbing life energy from anyone he came in contact with, including Superman. The Parasite would have been an even greater concept as to why he turned bad, since, like Rogue in X-Men, he could never have a relationship, since his condition would kill anyone who comes near.<br /><br />There was a great episode of the Adventures of Superman with George Reeves that would have done far better than the storyline here. Season 2, Episode 12: Panic in the Sky, December 5, 1953  \\"Superman rams a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth. The impact causes the asteroid to now orbit the planet. However, Superman is staggered as he returns to Earth. He manages to change back to Clark Kent (apparently a reflex action) but doesn't remember who he is. Meanwhile, the orbiting asteroid still presents hazards for Earth. Only Superman can place an explosive device that will demolish the asteroid -- and no one, including Clark, knows where Superman is.\\" No villains. No CGI every minute. This was a story about a man who subconsciously just wanted to be like everyone else and had to come to the realization that his own personal life was less important that that of the rest of the world. This was sort of the theme of Superman II. In fact, the best part of all of the Christopher Reeve movies was where Lois Lane dies and, despite Jor-el's warning, Superman turns back time to save her.<br /><br />So why Zod all the time? And, by the way, in the comic books, Clark would have given out a high-pitched super shriek to cause everyone in the crowd to wince and grab their ears, as he rescued his father. Not let him die.<br /><br />Man of Steel simply lacks heart, but then I see David S. Goyer as more of a rewriter than a screenwriter. I guess, though, if you have enough money to spend as does Warner Bros., you can bag rocks and label them diamonds. Man of Steel was as much of a disappointment to me as was Prometheus, which was replete with gaping plot holes and riddled with screen written stupidity. But I can't wait to see Ben Affleck as Batman (I say that with extreme sarcasm) in the comic book heroes first filmatic get together (first united in World Finest Comics in 1954).
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game is a lot of fum!!!! You really have to think it's good brain exercise!!! I do wish the print was bigger
B0063GORYU|1.0|Not very challenging.  Eric Sniders is more creative.  I would not play this on a regular basis.  I would delete this.
B0064W652A|5.0|A brilliant work of art and story<br />telling.  It takes everything you remember about the Batman and uses it in plot of a phenomenal story that keeps you mystified and second guessing yourself and wanting more.  Amazing.
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|I play this on my ipad and got much more before I had to purchase extra.  The free daily on ipad is great.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie alot! It kept me interested and had some good visuals. The acting was a touch cheesy at times, but it was worth watching!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin brings back in to the story elements that were sidelined in Book 4.  More pieces fall into place for what is coming.  If you are in this series, keep going!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This reminds me of James Herriot's books-they could make me laugh out loud as I read them. It is set in a small community of quirkily real (fictional?) people in Ireland. It also addresses the dark subject of child abuse gracefully, without being gross. Christina McKenna is a student of human nature, as was James Herriot. They were good observers of those around them, apparently, and as real life can be exraordianrily funny, the characters are larger than life and capivatingly endearing.<br /><br />I went on to read her next book, The Disenchanted WIdow, set in the same community with some of the same characters. It too was achingly funny and endearingly charming, interesting, and surprising. It also addressed some dark subjects of terrorists and family violence, but the main characters overcome their challenges.  In spite of the dark subjects, both books maintained a level of innocence and purity of heart. Extraordinary! This is one author I would love to meet in person.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The author has a keen understanding of human nature and the things we tell ourselves. Great read and I stayed with this book at every chance till it was over.
B00AZMFO9U|3.0|Of course, everyone is (should be) Maggie fans as she is one of the very few actresses of our time who will still be discussed a hundred years from now. However, it won't be because of this film. The screenplay simply is not well written and no matter how Dame Maggie and her fine co-stars struggle to raise the thin, predictable plot to a level befitting their talents the material just doesn't merit their attention. If you're a Downton/Potter fan and are not familiar with Maggie's brilliant career don't miss The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, California Suite,The VIPs (a so-so film with the exception of Ms Smiths scenes and the fabulous Margaret Rutherford in an Oscar winning performance), A Room with a View, and a quite beautiful Desdemona in Othello.
1439170916|5.0|Wonderfully written as a story narrative tone, instead of dry historic report, or scientific chronicle. Very informative, and intriguing with a flow not always found outside of fiction.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A unique writing style that kept me intrigued and entertained. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting a nice diversion from their usual genre.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! It's packed full of anything and everything you can imagine! I could spend hours looking at the amazing posts!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Love the game and like the fact that it makes you think great way to pass time!!!!!!!! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK
0064471837|5.0|This is by far my second favourite book of all time, second only to the second in the trilogy, Lirael. I put off reading it for a long time, because the concept seemed too weird to me, but when I finally got around to it, I just could not put it down. Since then I have read all three of the books more times than I've read the Harry Potter books (and that's saying something). I recommend this book, and the trilogy to all of my friends, and pretty much everyone I can, and I've managed to get a couple of people hooked. The biggest regret of my year was going away when Brisbane Writer's Festival was on, because I missed out on meeting the author, who is my favourite of all time, a huge hero, and through his work, he is one of the biggest influences in my life, and one of the biggest reasons that I want to be a writer.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Lots of twists and turns. Keeps you guessing trying to figure out &#34;who did it&#34;! I could read it again...
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|This monkey boxing game is well worth the money (although I got it when it was the free application of the day). You have your own monkey boxer.  You can dress it in all types of clothes, hairstyles,accessories. But not as feminine as it sounds. My favorite is the Cyclops glasses. There are sessions where you can train to raise either your strength, endurance, or speed.  They also generally increase during battle. During the match, there's a challenge where whoever spins the circle fast enough wins. So if you have long nails, a weak screen, a fear that it will break your screen, or don't like people watching you funny, you may want to beat the person so bad and not get hurt so that when you lose the challenge you can still win the match. As for the clothes, you typically unlock them after you have a big match and defeat the monkey wearing it. There is a<br />multiplayer option as well.<br /><br />I have a few suggestions to add to the game. It would be helpful if you could make different profiles just in case you want several different ones, you have siblings who play, or friends who play. I would also like to name my monkey. Perhaps a spin off of this gamer with an actual adventure and monkey dialogue.<br /><br />That's all for now. An overall good game. However it may get boring if you play more than 10-30 minutes at a time. But a few minutes every few times a day or once a day is sure to make you really love and appreciate the game. Plus, when you describe it to people, who doesn't wanna play monkey boxing? I mean seriously. I just moved and I'm going to a new school. Telling them that I have the coolest game ever, monkey boxing, really helped break the ice with some people. Anyways,  this game gets a 4 out of 5 on the Guru scale.
B004K4IZ3G|3.0|This movie isn't the greatest, but if you're looking for a Bluray to show off your home theater, this is a great choice.  The light cycle race about 40 minutes in has great visuals and audio.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Out of all the games i have gotten, this is the best and i never get tired of it. This is a great game and is fun for everyone to play.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My kids love this app they say it helps them fall asleep at night. They really like the few min we take to pick 3 sounds they want to put togeather for that night.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is an ok app. I don't like that you have to be online to play but other than that it is fun.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This is fun a little hard to control I would like it better on the computer. My son thinks it is great.
B001N3GUIE|3.0|&#34;Forbidden Planet&#34; is okay, but I'd like it a lot more if the Earl Holliman character wasn't around.  Call me a purist, but I've never been crazy about artificially-injected &#34;comic relief.&#34;  Let the laughs come from well-written principal characters, not some Bozo who's been foisted upon us by writers and/or a studio that didn't know any better.
B004NBZG06|5.0|Always a pleasure reading Georgette Heyer. She tells us a good story, she deeply knows the background, and her plots are delightful. I also love her style, the fact that each and every word she writes is there for a purpose, not due to negligence, poor editing or else. She knew her m&eacute;tier.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a amazing app. I like that I can read the bible or listen via audio in the old speaking KJV or listen in plain English. I can switch between the different version to make sure I am understanding what is being said. I have shared this app with friends.
B000OXHRRC|4.0|A good, interesting movie. It shows the underbelly of corporate greed, and how to get over it. Coyle, of Coupling is great in a small role.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I clicked on it by mistake. Don't like Bingo, so i deleted it right away.<br />Maybe I shoouldn't be rating it any way.
B00AALX5SI|4.0|Katy is a great inspiration and a positive role model for my kids.  Great story of a beautiful talented young rock star.
B001JI5DRC|5.0|Great movie.  It really &#34;pulls you in&#34; and makes you feel like you lived through it.  I recommend renting/buying it.
B005MLP8E0|1.0|Realize why I couldn't ever watch it until it's end.  It's unpleasant and ugly and grim. Yet another excuse for men's bad behavior and insensitivity; blame Mommy.  The movie sets were made of cardboard, in certain scenes you can see that the makeup used to create aging jowls on dear Orson were melting off his face.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|A nostalgic metal feel on many of these songs.  I love the space and slower tempos....it makes this album really easy to enjoy often.  This and the self titled album are surely my favorites in their catalog.
B00AIBZM40|5.0|thank you for this real good movie and it was in real good condition;i will be buying more from you.
B00ANAC32U|1.0|I bought this to replace my original bumper and it already broke again.  Time to try a new brand's case.
B005LAIHCW|5.0|i watched this movie so many times over and over and my friends have borrowed it never did this movie mess up thank you so much.
B008JFUO4U|2.0|Oblivion is a great Blu-ray disc but I still felt cheated. I bought a combo, which includes digital copy and ultra violet. However, when I tried to activate download, the system would not let me, saying that the code is not valid. Amazon should not send me something which I cannot download as they knew exactly where it was going to be sent in the first place and therefore, whether a particular version can or cannot be downloaded. I would like to keep the disc but I should be entitled to a refund for that portion of the order which I was not able to access.
B009XTF8JM|5.0|i love this movie i watched it so many times and it never messing up it plays like new thank you so much.
B009NQXXZ6|5.0|I first watched this wonderful movie more than 30 year ago and remained enchanted by the storyline, the sets, the performances of the stars, the music and particularly, by Barbra Streisand's soulful rendition of Evergreen, the Love Theme from A Star is Born. I watched it again last night - the enhanced Blu-ray version. It was oh, so wonderful. The graphics, the colours and the audio were all superbly enhanced and my enjoyment of the wonderful movie was magnified several folds. Magical. Thank you.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Tangles is a remake of the old fairy tale Rapunzel. This update has Rapunzel as a feisty modern thinker. Her prince charming is very funny loveable criminal. (Of course in the end he changes his unlawful ways.) The wicked witch is a twist from the original, and the color is amazing. I watched this with my grandchildren two times in a row. Tangles is very clever and fun. Bravo!
B005LAII4E|2.0|GI Joe is a great Blu-ray disc but I still felt cheated. I bought a combo, which includes digital copy and ultra violet.

B001UHOWW4|2.0|I was looking for a 50th anniversary BD version of BFT and bought this from a third party seller. The image displayed next to the product description gave an impression, that the disc was coming with a slip case.<br /><br />I was surprised, when I received the disc, which came in a shrink wrap!!  definitely not my idea of a 50th anniversary version and for the price charged ($24.95. I had to speak with the customer service rep, who suggested  to place a repeat order, thinking that the seller accidentally sent it that way. However, second time too, the item came in shrink wrap. When contacted the third party seller, he gave an explanation saying, that Warner Bros gave the distribution to some other studio, which decided to take the slip covers off of the disc cases. finally, I decided to give up and look for an alternative source to buy this item.<br /><br />Amazon customer service has been very co-operative during this period and did all it should, which is greatly appreciated.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This and threat vector are the only realistic IT fiction I've ever read, highly entertaining and has inspired me to seek a higher position at work to get in on this fun.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|This movie is not for everyone but if you're the type of person who is not overly sensitive to foul language and a little violence then this movie will be very entertaining.
B003G4W49C|2.0|This book was very disappointing.  It had been highly praised everywhere, including this website and I cannot for the life of me understand why.<br /><br />The main character, Ender, is recruited by some space agency as a child prodigy to hone his skills in warfare.  He spends all of his time with these \\"toons\\" of young kids who play some moronic version of interstellar agravitational laser tag in a fierce political environment.  This supposedly trains him to become the leader of the human forces against some dreadful alien species.  Meanwhile he plays these training games that are reminiscent of commodore 64 programs that somehow lodge in his brain to form some ultimate truth.  The whole time his brother and sister back on earth are ideologically taking over the world by writing book report style essays on the Internet.  Weird enough yet?  The author constantly needs to tell you how the kids are naked and showering.  Seriously man?<br /><br />Don't waste your time reading this.  I know it is science fiction but it is way too far fetched and just plain stupid at times.  The writing is pretty elementary so it might be decent for younger readers.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|My only complaint is that sometimes the hidden items are too small for a tablet. Otherwise, this game keeps searches fresh and varied. Mini games give pleasant breaks from hidden object scenes.
B004NS710C|3.0|If you need a movie to simply pass the time, then \\"UNSTOPPABLE\\" is movie to watch.  While based on a true happening of a few years ago, it was not one of Denzel Washington's better efforts.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love this game it my favorite game to play! My whole family can play in fact most of them do!  I was elated to find it on my app's! Thank you for putting on here. Hope everyone has a fun and exciting day!

B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is played a lot. I love the fact that it syncs with the game on Facebook. It is very addicting.
B001RP1G0U|5.0|The ending(I won't give it away) is what every 12yr girl old fantasizes about in a love story ending, it didn't disappoint. Thankfully that was the only part someone's daughter added to the movie; the rest was wonderfully grown up and realistic. Adding John Cusack's real life personality to the story was magic; someone really knew how to cast.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|The strong acting of the principals and in supporting roles (for the most part) is what holds interest here.  The writing is, however, somewhat machine-like which, despite the topical consistency, really doesn't help a show revolving about a conflict between man and machine intelligence of his making (and bent - somewhat tritely and arbitrarily - upon his destruction).<br /><br />Like so many sci-fi series (The 4400, Revolution, and Continuum come to mind), there's a premise with a question or mystery with the promise of resolution at the conclusion.  In between, are serial complications, surprises which either tend toward the denouement (revelatory, in other words) or temporarily confound linear progress toward same.  The writers' job is to inject both variety and some plausible necessity into succeeding episodes so that these are not experienced by the viewer as mere placeholders... excuses to pad the series out for as long as may be required.<br /><br />In that last, Terminator actually does better than most... but it is not a Fringe, a Fast Forward, or a Doll House.  One nice turn, though, is that the audience is made to care about the central android played by Summer Glau (recognized for her role in the Firefly series).<br /><br />It's fun.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I loved it. I will definitely watch this again, many times. I can only say that about a few movies.
0743289692|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's \\"Infidel\\" is a captivating well-written read ... a book I found hard to put down. She's very open and graphic about her life growing up in various Muslim countries under some extremely difficult situations, and yet she carried on, a determined (driven) woman, and overcame and excelled in her life.
B006P96PAO|5.0|An excellent, action-packed movie that combines a crime drama with the effect on families of not having a male role model committed to his family as he is to a demanding job.  There are heartbreaking moments, tense scenes, and actions that uplift you and challenge your concept of parenting and maintaining a job.  It is multiracial, devotedly Christian, and highly inspirational.  By the end of the movie, you will find a website that encourages you to make the same commitment to your job and family and provides Bible-based materials to allow you to introduce the kind of program that these police officers develop for their own lives.  Challenging at every turn, the movie speaks to a national issue seldom addressed:  how can men and women commit effectively to a job and still be unwaivering in their commitment as parents.  A must-see movie.

0143124544|5.0|Very thoughtful.  Gave me  pause to wonder how i would feel  if I were Lou or Will.. Her  character development was incitful: the contrast between the Traynors and Lou's parents; Lou's sister and Will's sister.  Moyes style of writing kept the story moving with the urgency mentioned in the story.  I liked the book very much.
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|I liked Halo.  This reminded me of a cross between Starship Troopers, Alien, and the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Kind of fun :)

B005MLP71Y|1.0|This movie starts out normal but half way through it gets weird. Society has too many frivolous lawsuits now and here's a cartoon movie for kids making a really abnormal situation look normal. The bee is suing business for stealing the honey; all the bee's cohorts are sweet and lovable and the honey business looks despicable. A good sell for abnormal thinking. That's the way Hollywood thinks these days and why I like older movies.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The chromecast is just plan easy to use. Right out of the box it's simple setup made it a breeze. After having it for a couple months I still use it every other day. I can't wait for more apps to support it, but it still has the staying power I need.
0525478817|1.0|The Fault in Our Stars isn't about cancer. (Cancer is so bubblegum and watered down in this book it takes backburner to nearly everything else.) The Fault in Our Stars is about John Green. It's about John Green's adoration for the generation that made him famous. It's about John Green rehashing tired philosophy from the existentialists to make himself appear intellectual to his child-dominated audience.<br /><br />The structure of the book is the same as Dog Soldiers by Robert Stone, as it is less of a story and more of characters waiting for a story. The opening (the Literal Heart of Jesus) is the same set-up as Fight Club, with the group counseling, a guy who has his balls cut out, and a character meeting an eccentric character that changes their life.<br /><br />As other reviews have expressed, every character in this novel is John Green. Hazel is John Green's consciousness. Augustus (who's name is \\"cleverly\\" taken from Augustus Caesar) is John Green's pseudo-intellectual mouthpiece. All of the parents are John Green's ideal version of his own parenting style. Most of the plot involves Hazel obsessing over an author who has written book about cancer and ended it on an ambiguous note . . . like John Green.<br /><br />John Green indirectly writes about himself, and it seems he knows little else to write about. He references Fitzgerald and Vonnegut as if he is on their literary level. This narcissism is not in any way earned. He hasn't created a body of work sufficient to the authors he compares himself to. I could leave this paragraph with this idea, but I want to address the issue further. Narcissism, while naturally abhorrent, can be overlooked when the author is offering something of substance or genius. What is John Green offering? Childish paraphrases of philosophy books that are nearly a century old or older. Still, what is even worse is his own pseudo-philosopophical pandering. For example, several times in the book it is marveled at the depth of a characterputting a cigarette in his mouth but refusing to light it. It shows the cigarette industry doesn't have power over his decisions. John Green treats this immature concept as if it is a brilliant philosophical revelation. But if we look at the action closer, it doesn't make any philosophical sense. To any mature adult, the cigarette isn't their rival; if you choose not to smoke, you choose not to smoke and life continues. There are bigger issues than if someone chooses to smoke. People who don't smoke (in life, not in fiction) do not have reason to publically display apologetic behavior. Augustus has no reason to make the cigarette industry his philosophical rival; he does so because John Green finds the action quirky. As countless YA novels have proven, quirky sells to the teenage demographic. (This is why Augustus also has a \\"goofy\\" smile.) The philosophy in The Fault in Our Stars isn't philosophy at deeper examination, it's just marketing.<br /><br />Both the characters and the plot are shallow. Hazel, who we are thought to relate to, describes herself early on in the book as having no interests in anything besides America's Next Top Model. She is asked to describe herself, and she is incompetent to even think of one adjective. She, however, refers to herself countless times in the novel as \\"awesome\\" or \\"great\\" . . . for a reason she can't even figure out. I understand this is relatable to today's myopic female demographic, who has little personality and few interests. I could accept this character on terms of realism, but, let's face it: characterless female protagonists make for no more interesting reading than their real life counterparts make for good spouses. Then John Green introduces Augustus, who is a stand-in for the \\"perfect guy\\", in that he gives the female protagonist something to live for, because it is implied she had nothing before him, except her favorite book. (As most teenage girls reading this kind of book wish Augustus would come and give themsomething to live for.) He pursues her for little to no reason (other than she looks like Natalie Portman, I guess). This isn't atypical of today's real teenage male trying to affirm his decision to chase a girl he knows is uninteresting and unintelligent. There is a scene where, in true to life fashion, Augustus tries to pry any sort of commendable personality traits out of Hazel. (After his failure to find anything interesting, he ends up commenting that she doesn't write poetry.) What is unrealistic, however, is that a teenage male would fall \\"in love\\" (as loose as the term can be used) and take the ridiculous lengths that Augustus does for such a girl. This seems more wish fulfillment for the female demographic than a plausible plot. [SPOILERS] By the point this wish fulfillment reaches its climax, John Green is so out of the spectrum of realism that he has his characters making out in the Anne Frank House while people clap around them. Soon after they have sex and Hazel is described as sensually feeling Augustus's \\"stub [leg]\\". [END SPOILERS] I can't, as most readers have, ignore this absurd plotting and poor writing.<br /><br />But who is asking for realism? Apparently none of John Green's fanbase. After the starting point of the two characters meeting, the novel turns into something of a fantasy. This is the most unrealistic portrayal of the thought process teenagers with cancer I've ever read. To put it simply, it's laughable. The only attempts Hazel, Augustus, and the secondary characters make to deal with their own impending deaths seem to be angst and sarcasm. There is no psychological difference between these teenagers and normal teenagers. They constantly spout the existential \\"depth\\" John Green ham-fistedly forces into their dialogue, but none of them attempt to understand the actual depth of accepting their own deaths. I put like to put emphasis on this because it seems readers of this book don't understand the full extent of what these characters areignoring. I do not buy for a moment that this is how teenagers react to a medical death sentence. The teenage characters in this book scoff at counseling (which is realistic), but their own scoffs seem to be the end of their thought process on the subject of their own deaths (which isn't realistic in the slightest).<br /><br />I think it is now time to write about my own experiences with the subject matter. I was diagnosed with cancer when I was 16, and pronounced in full remission when I was 21. I've been through months of chemotherapy. I've sat in children's cancer wards for most of my teenage life. I've waited for PET scans to pronounce if, to put it bluntly, I was going to have a life. I don't think this is the place for me to go into my thoughts during this time. I will say, from my own experience and the experience of the teenagers I've met with cancer, they understand death and do not react to it with sarcasm or petty philosophy. They don't quote Sartre. They're afraid. They're upset and exhausted. They don't act as if everything is fine and lead a normal (if angsty) life as the teenagers in this novel do. They don't have the power to stop their treatments at will, as is a point in the novel. They lose their hair, puke constantly, take shots several times daily in their legs, physically smell like medication, and only have the energy for social interaction perhaps once a week--if it's a good week. I don't recall any characters in this book having difficulty or pain from the port in their chest. None ever complain about the taste of saline that never leaves your mouth. It is to the novel's fault that John Green \\"ignore[s] with a grin\\" (to quote him) the facts of cancer.<br /><br />If John Green learned to focus on social realism (as he thinks he does), he would have an interesting stance on story structure. If he would replace the angst and childish musings in his writing with developed prose, he would be decent at technical writing. Every problem this novel(and its subsequent generation) has is one with inability to grow up. It is entirely possible that John Green could be a decent writer if he were to mature.

B000ASATZ8|3.0|I always wanted all 4 of the Tremor movies.. Was so happy to get them. Tremors 1 went through really good, then I noticed Tremors 2 through 4 started cutting out. Sound kept cutting out so bad that I gave up on them. I was very disappionted in the quality of the DVD's. After examination of the other 3 movies.. I noticed all 3 had bad scratches on them. Looks like they were sold old or used not new like it said it was. Will think again about ordering any more movies from Amazon.

B00DYFCYSO|3.0|This is a throwback CD. Well, sort of. Obviously, John Legend is currently (per the media) in love and in lust. His love theme CD with moaning vocals and slow stroking melodies brings back baby making music. Not since the likes of Teddy Pendergrass, Smokey Robinson and Barry White has anything so lusciously suggestive been released. I only wish Legend would have just recorded all covers for this set. So what if he is a singer-song writer, he could never top the baby making classics of the past. His too brief take of Anita Baker's \\"Angel\\" as an interlude should have been a full track. It alone is my favorite moment on this bedroom romp. Modern vocal enhancements are abused on several songs. They are not working on Legend's moaning mumble of trying to sound sexy. Often the enhanced result sounds like he's CONSTIPATED and suffering.
0385335482|2.0|I understand that this book is not \\"War and Peace\\" - it is escapism-fiction.  But still, it is so riddled with stereotypes and downright unlikeable characters that I could not really find much to enjoy.  Just as American fiction seems to be filled with loser guys who magically seem to \\"somehow\\" get all the hot girls, British fiction seems to personify the ditzy, disorganized young woman who somehow attracts a hot, rich super-successful business man who can't quite explain why he is just so darn attracted to her.  Maybe if the writing was cleverer I would buy it.  But this is a thin story that was clearly spread out over multiple books to encourage purchases (and movie deals?)  The whole thing feels formulaic, calculated and phoned-in.

B004SUDQ8Q|4.0|Rabbit Proof Fence which was based on a true story by Doris Pilkington Garimara was about what her mother endured in 1931.  The movie is a must see for everyone to truly understand what the Australian Government did to assimilate and transform the traditions and religious beliefs of the Aborigine culture.  To begin with in 1770 the British established a penal colony on the eastern half of the country and over time many colonist formed families with the Aboriginal people and over the next 130 years changed the ethnicity of the country.  The movie transports you to 1931 when the City of Victoria Australia was enforcing the Aboriginal Protection Act which developed and maintained controls over where the Aboriginals could live, work and who they could marry.  They even passed an Act known as the Half-Caste Act which removed children of Aboriginal people that were mixed with the colonist.  The Chief Protector of the Aboriginal people was a man named A.O. Neville who was in charge of enforcing the Half-Caste Act.  In the movie three girls named Molly (Evelyn Sampi) age 14, her younger sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and Gracie (Laura Monaghan) their cousin were removed against their will and family and taken over 1200 miles to a religious based boarding school named Moore River Native Settlement in Perth.  Moore River was designed to educate the Half-Caste children into the white world and train them to be servants and marry white men.  The goal was to breed the Aboriginal ethnicity out of them over time. This movie becomes an adventure when Molly finds the courage to take her sister and cousin and escape Moore River to get home.  Just imagine yourself as a young teenage girl having to walk or run 1200 miles to get home.  That is the distance between New York City and Tampa Florida.  Not knowing what roads or trails to take they followed a fence that divided Australia into sections from west to east and north to south.  The fence was referred to as the Rabbit Proof Fence and they followed it home to Jigalong Station.  They endured rain, sweltering heat and hunger while knowing they were being tracked by an experienced Aboriginal tracker and The Chief Protector's men whose goal was to return them to the Moore River Settlement.  You must watch this movie to witness through their eyes what obstacles these three young girls endured.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I downloaded this awhile ago (not through amazon). It's a really nice game that kids will love. The game has a bunch of different smaller games to play. It can keep someone busy for quite along time. You can feed, dress, groom, vet, compete, and even have more than 1 horse. The horses are even pretty. Worth the download!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the game.  You get the first ten levels for free. I was able to figure most levels out in 5 minutes.  That is as long as I had to work on each level anyway so it was good for me. This is not overly challenging. I do recommend!
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|Joss Whedon. Shakespeare. Alexis Denisof. Amy Acker. Clark Gregg. Fran Kranz. Sean Maher. Tom Lenk. Reed Diamond. Nathan Fillion.<br /><br />How could this film NOT be awesome?<br /><br />For those that don't know, Whedon is not only the king of all things geeky (BUFFY, ANGEL, FIREFLY, DOLLHOUSE, SERENITY, CABIN IN THE WOODS and a little film called THE AVENGERS), but he's a tremendous Shakespeare buff. Stories have circulated for years about how he would have cast members of his various shows come to his Santa Monica home, sit around, have dinner and drinks and recite some of Shakespeare's plays. Now, he has essentially brought that idea to film in a \\"micro-budgeted\\" self-produced digitally-shot black-and-white adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most famous comedies, MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. Whedon, not one to shy away from working with his friends, made this film with many of his former cast members of his various shows and films, and it's shot entirely in and around that same Santa Monica home.<br /><br />For those that don't know the play, it is a love story of two couples: there's the love-at-first-sight coupling of Claudio (Kranz, as excellent as he was in both DOLLHOUSE and CABIN IN THE WOODS) and Hero (Jillian Morgese, a talented and beautiful newcomer), and there's the epic battle-of-the-sexes coupling of Benedick (Denisof) and Beatrice (Acker). Much romance and comedy ensues, but the jealous plotting of Don John (Maher) threatens to undo everything. But soon to the rescue comes Dogberry (Fillion), the constable of these parts, who is, as should be noted, an ass.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh, who has spent most of his directorial career adapting Shakespeare for the screen (HENRY V, HAMLET), did a film adaptation of this back in the early 1990's with something of an all-star cast. There are several similarites but even more differences between Whedon's and Branagh's adaptations, and it's the differences that make or break the film. While the Branagh version had Hollywood heavyweights such as Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Michael Keaton and Branagh himself, this is filled with people who may be popular to their fans but are hardly box-office draws, and there's where this film is, in part, more successful. Whedon casts each actor to their strength as opposed to going for bigger names, and the performances are more robust, more natural, and more absorbing. Whedon's version also forgoes the period trappings, and does everything against a modern backdrop. This is not an unusual method for adapting Shakespeare, but it works better in some ways than Branagh's more sweeping and elegant period piece. Also, this film does some slight gender-swapping for at least one character (turning a male character of Conrade, Don John's co-conspirator and lover, into a female one). This, to me, is a hinderance, mostly because of my personal interpretation of the character of Don John, but it ends with personal opinion.<br /><br />Ultimately, both films are pretty great, but if I had to say which one I enjoyed watching more, it's this one. And while Branagh and Thompson, who played Benedick and Beatrice in their version, are acting gods, I could watch Denisof (perhaps the most underrated actors of the Whedonverse) and Acker (whose character actor status has grown exponentially since her days on ANGEL) play these roles every single day and twice on Sunday. They are an absolute joy to watch together, particularly after their work together on ANGEL, and especially how their characters played out on that program. I don't want to spoil too much for those who haven't yet tasted the amazing show that ANGEL was (my favorite of the Whedonverse programs), but let's just say things could have been better for Denisof and Acker on that show. In fact, every actor brings their A-game. Shining particularly brightly (other than Denisof and Acker) are Gregg as the wise and jovial Leonato, Diamond (another veteran of DOLLHOUSE) as the strong andclever Don Pedro, and Fillion as the blundering and exhuberant Dogberry.<br /><br />This film has more moments of great comedy than most of the other comedies released recently, with maybe the exception of Wright and Pegg's THE WORLD'S END, but the only real minus against this film is Whedon's lack of visual flair. He's always been much more of an actor's director, and with his confident work on SERENITY and THE AVENGERS, it seems like he took more of a point-and-shoot style to this film, but in the end, that's more than enough, because Shakespeare's work is more often about the actors than the director, which might be why it does lack a more substanitive style as to not over-shadow the performances, which range from pretty great to astonishingly great.<br /><br />Whedon's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING may not stand in the same circles as Olivier's HAMLET, or Branagh's HENRY V, or Polanski's (or Welles') MACBETH, but I believe it's perfectly happy just hovering around them.clever Don Pedro, and Fillion as the blundering and exhuberant Dogberry.<br /><br />This film has more moments of great comedy than most of the other comedies released recently, with maybe the exception of Wright and Pegg's THE WORLD'S END, but the only real minus against this film is Whedon's lack of visual flair.

B009IF8CH6|5.0|Great show.  Jim Parsons brings the character of 'Sheldon' to life in a believable way, that he could both be a genius but also retain the innocence of a child.  Brilliant.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you should get this game it alsome you unlock stuff get rewards and its very interesting and fun to play
B0058BI864|5.0|Great show.  Jim Parsons brings the character of 'Sheldon' to life in a believable way, that he could both be a genius but also retain the innocence of a child.  Brilliant.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Great classic! Really good movie from the 80's. recommend to all your friends. Lower streaming makes it grainy. Recommend LTE.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Brilliant reinterpretation of Sherlock Holmes in NYC.  Well played by all the cast.  Incorporates asides during exposition similar to those found in the Guy Ritchie adaptations, which provides a strangely comforting continuity.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This film is great! Maybe even better than the 1974 Robert Redford +Mia Farrow movie of the same name.<br />I would highly recommend this movie.
B002P79KAC|5.0|Great show.  Jim Parsons brings the character of 'Sheldon' to life in a believable way, that he could both be a genius but also retain the innocence of a child.  Brilliant.
B00DHHWXYY|2.0|Frenetic energy gushed everywhere in this film, creating such a motion sickness that I'm surprised they didn't supply barf bags to the people in the audience. And sadly, some of the imagery was indeed clever and could have worked if it had been used sparingly and as a thematic spice, but instead it drenched the film in a stylized vomit that obscured the entire point of the story. In short, the signal to noise ratio in the movie may make your head explode. Although Luhrmann presents a fair amount of the story from the novel, it's like reading the Cliff Notes version. The characters act out famous scenes, recite memorable lines, but in the end it's all devoid of meaning. I felt sorry for Leonardo and Carey who were fine actors desperately seeking an equally fine director -- at least a director who understood the definition of \\"subtlety.\\"
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It's great. What more can I say.  I like the ability to set up multiple alarms for all my various commitments.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Good app for checking on my page on the go. Never any glitches or problems loading on my Galaxy. Updates regularly and stays current without hassle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|At first i used my moms bank account and built stuff but then my mom found out and refunded it<br /> but then my mom let me get it again and it saved my stuff!!!! Best app ever!!!!!!!!
B00E72OKAS|5.0|the best app ever but you can see if you like it on the innter net. but you should just buy it it is grate
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like that it doesn't end that you get to lay every day if you want. and I love hidden object games. the scenes are pretty and the objects are not always in the same place so it does change
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|My 5 year old and I both love it! The music is hilarious and the puddings' sound effects are great too.
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|I've heard of bad albums, but this is ridiculous. There's only one to describe this album: \\"Sexism\\". It's obvious that Lil Wayne isn't even trying. The album is horrible to listen to. The lyrics are terrible, the production is bad, and there are too many curse words. My advice is don't buy Lil Wayne's album. It's a waste of money and it's a waste of time.
B00890JFMW|2.0|this is a purchase that I am not pleased with.  Sorry I bought.  Not as expected and not a relaxing cd which is what I was looking for.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|For a little sharpener it gets the job done very impressed although it could be made of a better plastic can't beat it for the price.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|One of the better bingo games on the internet.Easy to trade items for the different cities or just talk over the game with others .
B0017KIBAI|5.0|The Controller was brand new and still in the box.  The cord is longer than other gamecube controllers.  The controller works perfectly!
B009GIPDQS|3.0|It has been over ten years that I have last read Grisham. I liked a lot couple of his first books and thought I would try this one as it sounded interesting.<br /><br />First half of the book is well written with nice plot. I just turned the pages forward. But then something happened.... Second half of the book is just stupid, with movie making, cocaine, guns, Jamaican jail, Canadian gold bullions....<br /><br />I would recommend that consider, before buying this one instead of the earlier Grisham books.
B00275EGX8|5.0|This movie was full of suspense right up until the end and is a very elaborate account of some of the dangers our US military faces each and every day. It is a dangerous world out there hats off to these folks they fight for our liberty and freedoms day in and day out this is just a small window into what they all face very good!
B0044XUZ9K|5.0|My daughter had to read this book for high school.  It was a great classic for her to read. :)
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is so additive. It is very well done with a the little extra such as the little goblins
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Enjoy playing without spending a lot of money. Will continue to play this for some time. Will also be checking out more of g5 games.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|It was boring and I wasn't quite sure whether it was a musical or not.  I was glad when it finished.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The first book of the series, and it had me at the first page. Classified as fantasy, but don't let this scare you - the realism and excellent characters of the book (and series) brings reading to a new level.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is very well written.  You get to know each character very well and he does an excellent job of connecting all the lives together.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I first started reading the book....I though it was going to be a big sex novel. But as I read it I completely feel in love with every word and emotions in the book. I absolutely love this book!
B008469DGY|5.0|This is quite a visually impressive looking flick an object with your finger type game.  As you would imagine with a title called Flick Golf, that object is a golf ball.  As you might not imagine with a title called Flick Golf, there's an archery/darts type target on the green with the hole (complete with flag that you also get points for hitting) situated where the bullseye would be  on the target.  The objective obviously is to firstly land somewhere on the target and as close to the hole as possible, preferably in it. If you flick too far or too short you can end up on other parts of the course including the water.<br /><br />There's only a few courses at first but as you reach a target score other courses are unlocked.  They are situated all over the world and the colourful background scenery does display nicely on the Kindle HD screen.  Most finger flicking games, there's really no point to, your just flicking stuff at a colleague in an office or a zombie or something.  I enjoyed having a point to the flicking action.  If you like this style of playing games you might also want to check out an app called Grumpy Bears.  That one and this one would be the two best finger flicking games I've come across so far in the Amazon app store.<br /><br />You don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi to play this once you've downloaded it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great alone time activity with many puzzles. I like the pre-puzzle comic that gives context to the puzzles. Worth the price, although I got it when Amazon offered it free.
B008602KQI|3.0|Jennifer Lawrence was amazing as Katniss Everdeen, but the movie as a whole is a very weak sister to the incredible imagination and imagery the author brought to the novels.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game and would advise it to people, it is a great hidden puzzle game with other game within it
B000089RV6|5.0|I have always loved the hard rocking rhythms of AC/DC. They are one of my favorite bands of all time.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|But then again, I am a fan of Meryl Streep, and Goldie Hawn.  I don't have all of the movies that I want in my collection of Goldie, but I am working on it&#62;
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Why would I find someone suffering from Asperger's Syndrome interesting? The nature of their condition would suggest an introverted, difficult to access character . Not the case in this story. An hilarious, sympathetic portrait of a sufferer who is both aware and unaware of himself and sets out with determination to change his life and in the process the lives of others. This is not meant to be a deep book, but is a delightful read from start to finish.
B00BDSRMIQ|5.0|Loved Join Schaefer's guitar work.<br />He makes it so simple, yet so awesome.<br />Always a great band live,<br />Go see them.
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|I love to play this game it is fun and relaxing but it also is a challenge.  You get a lot of different levels included for 1.99 it is worth it.
0812550706|5.0|The book arrived promptly. Very good story. My son doesn't read much so, the story will have to be interesting. This one he read cover to cover.
B005C0DHEY|4.0|Great job bringing the truth out with stories all across the US of the Fracking industry regarding the dumping of hundreds of toxic chemicals into the ground, the lack of regulations on this industry, and the poisoning of thousands of people across the US.<br /><br />They consistently deny the ground water is polluted but also when they meet with the affected citizens, refuse to drink the very water that they have declared fit for consumption.<br /><br />If they made an enforceable law that required all the Fracking industry employees to consume the very water they potentially will affect, that would certainly bring about better results to prevent the poisoning of the ground water.  If they really aren't affecting the water, they should have nothing to fear.  The fact that residents can light a match to their tap water shouldn't bother them. SNAFU!
B008OOYALE|3.0|Love the app but didn't recieve 2900 gold ordered on sale last week. It went thru Amazon, it's on my card as a charge. Team lava has ignored my complaint. Terrible customer service!
B00DQR26EC|5.0|I have not played any games like this previously.... and now I want to. this is a wonderful game with an interesting story and funny dialog... keep out of reach of children.<br />humorous sometimes involves cussing.
B00BR476TG|5.0|Now, this is a real film! very lovely story and beautifully crafted. A film for everyone and past all OK levels to Superb!
B0079R8KXG|4.0|I bought this for a grandchild and it is working well for her. I wanted something that would hold up to a young teenager and so far this cover is good.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|App was free so I downloaded it.  File was big so I tried to cancel to no avail.<br /><br />Turns out game is interesting, but wouldn't say addicting.  After a couple of days and leveling up, etc can play for more than 20 minutes without running out of energy.  Feel like game would be funner if I was willing to pay for energy or coins.<br /><br />When start game is annoying screen for other apps by developer.  This is second request today for me to write review.  So now can get some bonus whatever.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|LOVE that's its a males POV! Took a little getting use to him talking to me, but once it was normal reading...I loved it! I enjoyed the relationship between the characters build and the comedy it brings. :-)
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|The acting was fantastic and Tom Cruise was the bright spot in this science fiction movie. The script lacked the necessary story elements in order to be outstanding. The cameo appearance of Morgan Freeman was too brief. The special effects were more than adequate.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Had me completely sucked it!!! I loved the relationship between Holder and Sky, knowing some how there was something more. The twists and turns that happen through the book just kept me thinking there couldn't be MORE that could possibly happen...but there was! LOVED this Book!!!! :-)
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love this cd. The music just makes you feel good. If youre in a bad mood , this cd will definitely cheer you up. Lyrics to the songs are awesome as well.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really like this game, it has enough levels to keep it interesting and I like the story and graphics. I have played it several times and still enjoy it.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|This app can only work under the system with English version. It is not friendly to Asia user at all.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|It's so fun even I love it! It's great for kids. And you can get it on a wii for wii game's.
159463176X|2.0|I was too confused after the first half<br />Couldnt keep all those names straight. I may try to read it another time, because I didn't finish it
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great read.  If you have read The Hunger Games you must read this book.  I could not put it down and I am ready to begin the next book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My son likes the horse. I just wish that it didn't take 20 energy to train the horse. I think that it would be better if you could use soap and water to groom the horse.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|gave this as a present , they loved it and haven't stop using it since<br />he even stopped using the roku
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|This product is amazing, i have been waiting 1 year because i have the first lego, now with the nether and the village i feel excited, ;)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Many of the puzzles are challenging and do require some logic solving each one, if you're ever bored but want to exercise your brain, these puzzles are sure to entertain for awhile.
B0092EE5HY|4.0|twenty words are seventeen words to many, when just three words will do, such as &#34;I liked it. Does that satisfy your requirements?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is just as addictive as subway surfer and temple run but with a despicable me theme.  And who doesn't love the minions in this movie?!
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|twenty words are seventeen words to many, when just three words will do, such as &#34;I liked it. Does that satisfy your requirements?
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Excellent read. Hard to put down. This series is addictive and exciting. Always action packed and easily the best series I have found this year.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|twenty words are seventeen words to many, when just three words will do, such as &#34;I liked it. Does that satisfy your requirements?
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|At first glance puzzles seem easy enough but get tougher as you advance. Really tests your analytical skills.  Great fun! I highly recommend it.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Suspense, intrigue, and action are not the sole province of the young. These aging spies put James Bond to shame with their ability to divine the nature of the machinations surrounding them and respond with measures to achieve their ultimate goal and not simply escape from the immediate trouble. The characters are a little predictable but entertaining anyway.
B003LL3LHO|5.0|the writing is really good, loved the plot.<br />its a really easy book to read on the go. loved the twist ending
B008AK8FHM|3.0|There is no question of the unshakable belief in this expanded universe that the author experienced. And given his education and profession, he has great credibility. Even so, he has not made a believer out of me.
0399255370|5.0|I bought this for my 3 year old grandson. But before I gave it to him, my husband and I read it first and we loved it. It's so cleverly written. Each page is about a different crayon voicing it's displeasure of it's color and why. This is a delightful book with excellent illustrations. It's a very humorous book, too, as each crayon tells its tale. I highly recommend it. I think as my grandson gets older and can read it by himself, he'll enjoy it as much as he does now.
B006QF61VA|4.0|Excellent Robin Williams comedy routines disbursed throughout the movie.  The backdrop gives a glimpse of the key issues in the time period...the Vietnam War.<br /><br />A good mixture of funny and not-so-funn situations.<br /><br />John R.
0061906220|5.0|Pete the Cat is now my grandson's favorite character. He is 3 and got a kick out of Pete's adventures wearing white shoes. Nice colorful book.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Use it all the time.  I suggest anyone with an android try it out. You will not be disappointed.  Thanks to the developers.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a very cool app! Not your typical note taking app. It has everything you need right at your finger tips. The only thing it is missing is an actual calendar in it, which I expect them to come out with any day now! All in all, best app for this category.
B006JRY2QG|4.0|I missed this show when it was new but see a lot of people use the shows picture as profile pic on motorcycke forums. I watch a couple of season one shows and now Catching up on all the seasons, however I'm really enjoying the show. Looking forward to the new season.
B00EPVTLKU|5.0|Great album I heard her song and for the longest thought it was Mariah Carey when I found out it was Cat from victorious I downloaded her whole album and I love it  she has a great voice
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Helps pass time and very awesome graphics. I recommend this game to everyone of all ages :) I love minions and this game satisfies my love for them!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|MS got me hooked on this game, so now I can not do with out it.<br />The play is very clean and quick.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I love the Weeknd and this is an awesome deal for three CD's. I thoroughly enjoy all of them and would recommend this purchase to anyone who also enjoys his songs.
B003ASLJMW|5.0|Not terribly realistic but good suspense and action.  DVD used, but in good shape.  It is a movie I like to see repeatedly.
0316017922|4.0|This book puts a new and old slant on being in the right place at the right time and taking advantage of it. easy read.
B00CO8TA4I|4.0|This processor works and hasn't had any problems. My computer is much faster, but I replaced the RAM, hard drive, motherboard, graphics card, as well as the processor so it's a computer-age Ship of Theseus. Does the same case and power supply make it the same computer? It occupies the same space and has the same peripherals. Is it still the Computer of Me? To answer this deep question, go take some metaphysics classes at your local college (do the for-profit colleges offer things like philosophy or is it all accounting, dental hygiene and computer repair? Practical things.)<br />Any way, I report that the chip had no problems installing and it runs quickly. This model won't overclock, but then, I'm not an overclocker. Sure, I build my own computers, but if I want that extra performance, I buy a better chip.)<br />Not much else to report here. Fast and doesn't explode. So it's good.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Great read! Gives a new light on what it is like in prison. Hard to put down once you pick it up.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Bought this movie for my boyfriend since it's his favorite and I liked it! Product came very early which was nice :)
B008HK3XU4|3.0|The corners have already chipped off, so my purple cover has white showing at the folds  after only a few months.
B008469DGY|3.0|Flick Golf is a cute game but gets boring very quickly. It's not real responsive to the touch screen as well.
1932100660|2.0|I didn't like this book, it's like a textbook. Very wordy, small print, hard to follow. If u want a good easy to follow condensed book on health get Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar book.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|My husband loves it. It was a gift for him. I would reccend this concert if you are a Rush fan
0545586178|4.0|I thought The Hunger Games - Catching Fire was a good read but not as good as the first book in the series. This book is entertaining and this started off as a soppy love story and then went into the action. It describes the torment of the characters yet it still has some romance in it. The main character, Katniss Everdeen who is in love with two people - Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne - both of whom she has known for most of her life. In the book the Capital's leaders are trying to kill off the victors but there are people who live in a rumoured district 13 who save 5 victors who have reached an alliance with each other. Overall this book is a good choice for people over 12 years of age.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I have read all of this series a really enjoy All of her books. They keep you interested, guessing and are full of action. I highly recommend this book
B004IY6API|4.0|I was excited to find and always loved this album. A stylistic turning point for the band that's no less relevent but now old enough to be more difficult to find in any traditional music store. I was however dismayed receive one in a smashed jewel case. Not directly the sellers fault but the packaging a lot to be desired. A windowed cardboard sleeve with no padding will rarely survive shipping. A simple enough transfer to a new case solved the problem and there was no damage to the disc itself luckily. I ship for a living so I know that this can be remedied in a. cost-effective way
B003B02O0A|5.0|This book stands alone. I am glad I read this John Grisham book last from his collection.  Three more word.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I enjoyed this game. it presented some challenge and the story line worked well. the only reason why it isn't a 5 star is because the touch when you enlarge the screen kept giving penalties.
0061124958|5.0|My daughter loved this book of course.  It's a classic.  It doesn't need a review, it speaks for itself.  Beautiful story.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|It was a fun game but I finished the game in less than 2 hours. I wish there was more to the game like maybe a second or third part without having to make any future purchases.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|My son and I are totally hooked on this show.  We love the syfy nature of the plot but also the complicated relationships between the characters.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a must see movie that is endearing and realistic in its portrayal of love and relationships. My only gripe is the Adult Movie couple-I wish I could edit them out to make the movie a little cleaner. Otherwise, I love, love this movie. The ending is beautiful and fun.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|This story blew me away! The title and artwork gives the impression of a dark story full of blood, and it didn't disappoint. A few good twists at the end kept me guessing also. Awesome book.
B0042816YK|4.0|I saw this movie on TV and enjoyed it. I don't understand the critical reviews. I enjoyed watching her inner journey to find her way. Julia Roberts shines as usual.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|Every second I was turned on the edge of the raceway and the steering was horrible, in my opinion this game is a two star value.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This is an amazing movie about love,overcoming poverty and tremendous personal strength. It is one of those movies that makes you feel good after watching it.
0231161166|5.0|Without question epigenetics is going to be increasingly important in science and in matters of personal health.  This is a good basic introduction that will be useful even to those who have a limited knowledge of modern science.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Love the way the story in this book unfolded.  The author really makes you feel for the main characters. Certainly makes you wonder what if..
B006FE83UE|5.0|Despite its age, this film holds up well as a classic.  While its focus is upon equal justice for all Americans, regardless of race, what comes through in Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch is the courage and nobility of character, in truth the heroism of his role without brovado.  Would that all our young people would wish to demonstrate his integrity in their lives.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|fit was good it was for spouse kindle have not gotten any more complaint  about cover after replacing her old one
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|This game is a good fast moving game that combines attention to detail and fun.  It lets you make choice moves that can help or hinder you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a challenging game. Not too easy, but it is solvable. I can't wait for the other floors to be added.
B0081336FO|5.0|I am unsucessfully waiting for season three by rewatching season two AGAIN! Come on! Its been close to two years! I am jealous of those of you just discovering this now. Enjoy and jump in the fandom. We are all a little mad here...
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I was looking for an alarm clock that was simple to set up and use. Lucky me that this works really well and it's fool proof.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Well-written and acted, respect for the original books, fantastic cinematography and pacing. The modern-day overtones are extremely well-placed. Sets and wardrobe are also brilliant.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Good movie, enjoyed it.  Was a well written and acted movie.  Leo and Toby did a great job and the videography was really cool
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|great movie filled with actions and thrills, oh and did i say action.! from beginning to the end. will keep you on the edge.
B006QPVGKG|3.0|It was thought provoking but at times, the movie was a little slow.  A little more detail in the scrip might have made it more engaging at the beginning.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Beachboys are still the greatness that they were in our youth !  Beats the stones !  And the WHO stinks !!!
B001EBWIUO|5.0|I have seen this movie several times in the past. Its an interesting character study in how a little greed can push an otherwise more or less law abiding person into lawlessness.<br /><br />Bogie plays Fred C. Dobbs, an American in Mexico down on his luck who teams up with another down on his luck American and an old man with gold prospecting experience to search for gold.<br /><br />The scenery is great and the encounter with some banditos with the classic \\"badges\\" lines is hard to beat.<br /><br />Dobbs slowly slides off into paranoia and lawlessness.<br /><br />The old man is played by the director's father. I found his laughing a bit annoying in places. He hammed it up a lot.
B002R88G5E|5.0|This is a story that makes me think about others.  Life ina country where women are dominated by men and all their days are spent in terror.  There were wonderful stories about the women and the bonds they made amongst themselves and how their priority was their children.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|love it<br />this is the best iron man app of all time the graphics are good the mechanics are good the difficulty is amazing
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|bruno mars is a likeable guy which comes across clearly in his singing - good voice too - winning combination
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app on my kindle and iPhone for keeping notes and making lists on the go.  It's great for jotting down ideas so that I don't forget them later. The added bonus is that these notes follow me from one device to the next and to my computer so that I have them where ever I need them. I love this sweet little app.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|This was a gift from &#34;Nana&#34; for my grand daughter. She loved IT!!!!  She could not wait to show it to me on facetime!
B008PU8SR4|4.0|This is a excellent book from the perspective of an autistic child. It gives great insight into their behaviour. The portrayal of the parents is believable.
B00CEMH31Q|4.0|I am Hanson fan since the beginning, but I was little bit skeptical about this album - first I did not like very much the direction they went with the Shout It Out (although I really liked some songs on that album too) and their new song Get The Girl Back indicated they might be going the same way with Anthem again... So I was not in a hurry to buy their new album Anthem (I know, shame on me), but I am glad I finally did! The first time I listened to it I was really surprised, it's definitely the kind of album I was waiting for! I love most of the songs, in my opinion the songs are unique and memorable and the album sounds fresh and keeps you in a good mood from the beginning to its end :)<br /><br />My most favorite songs: I've Got Soul, Already Home, Scream And Be Free, Tragic Symphony, Tonight<br /><br />Also I am very excited to go to my very first Hanson concert in just 2 weeks! And my husband is going with me, he doesn't know Hanson much so I am very curious what he will say about their music :)<br /><br />Also this was the first time I purchased music from Amazon using Amazon Cloud and it was a great experience, definitely I recommend it to all.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun app and the graphics are awesome .  The target audience is more geared for a 13 year old girl our an adult with lots of free time
B00AC8ZIXO|3.0|The movie was okay, that's about it...okay. I guess some people like to know the story of what happened at a base/training facility, but if you're familiar with Halo at all, you already know certain aspects and would rather see action, versus background stories on candidates in training.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like this game so far. It's fun but you can only play a little at a time since you run out of energy fast.
B00AW0KGYI|3.0|My wife and daughters loved it, I need more action and less soap opera to stay intrigued. But overall a good movie...have only watched it once though.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Exactly what I was expecting. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a bumper for the nexus 4.
B004PGAQMW|4.0|Adult overtones not so overt that kids can pick up on them and good family entertainment. My daughter loved it and soundtrack finally used music I can enjoy instead of that fifi fluffy top 40 smuckers jelly stuff that sucks!
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|And this is no exception. Track after track is always great music with Joe.  I have all of his music and look forward to every new CD he puts out. Big fan here!
B0053O89RY|5.0|Hilarious, well written, laugh with your belly funny and clever.  The characters are so real as to be totally relatable. I love it because it has all age groups represented in a realistic way making all who view it realize that this is The Modern Family.
B00CATSONE|1.0|Very disappointing in that it is not a biography of Nikola Tesla. His name is not even mentioned until one-third of the way into this \\"book.\\"<br />It reads as if it's a high school paper - at least an \\"A\\" paper.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|What's not to like about It's a Wonderful Life?  The DVD version is optically clear and fun to watch. A family movie with life lessons and moral obligation stories that are much needed in today's world. I would recommend it to anyone!
B008469DGY|3.0|more info on the power of the flick would be helpful in determining the strength of the flic in ralation to the distance of the ball.
B004HW7JH4|3.0|This series is unnecessarily full of sexual content. The story line would be as interesting without it. This season is more of the same of the previous seasons. I would not let anyone under 18 watch the stories. It does show clearly the fear of a male dominated business allowing women to join as equals.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like this game a lot.  Not only do you get to solve hidden object scenes, there are also puzzles to solve too.  There is a good story line.
B00DYCBH4O|4.0|Fun book. Much easier to listen to it than read it. It was an enjoyable story.  It's a definite must at least once in your life.
B00COCY67A|5.0|This is the best album I have heard of Elvis in a long time. I recommend it to all Elvis collectors who will truly appreciate his great voice. This one is truly special!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I loved the realistic portrayal of mental anguish, and the ability to overcome the pain. I will watch it again.
B001O1O71C|5.0|This book truly shows the innocence of children through a time so bad as this one. I've of the best books I have ever read.
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|it does what its supposed to do but it is not real high quality on my first gen kindle fire.  I have the app &quot;bass booster&quot; and that is amazing. it does all that this app does but is full screen, easier to use, customizable sliders, more presets, and ability to save custom sets; and that is just the light version.
B008VPDD6O|5.0|I am Not going to reveal the conclusion to this \\"Final\\" chapter. Cus it was COOL!!!!!!!!!!<br />I will say it was a BLAST! I bought it in 3d..I know that now 3d tvs are still on the spendy side and Hopefully they will come down for the biggest screens soon. I'll never go back to a 2D tv. If you want Gore (LOVE Horror) and a fun stay with it movie, \\"Final\\" has it all. WAS a bit spendy but all 3D are...for now. I just dont get the marketers..would you rather price High to get 20 thousand people to buy for $35.00 over a period of a year OR price it at $15.00 and get 20 MILLION to buy in a period of a Month??? Same with the 3D tvs!<br />MovieMan
B00005JLCI|5.0|My expectations when approaching one of Shakespeare's plays are usually very low.  However, Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of Hamlet for the screen, including his casting, direction, and acting not only met my hopes but often  exceeded them.<br /><br />Attending performances of Hamlet, over the years, by local theater groups, never failed to leave me with extreme disappointment and with the conclusion that Americans were too intimidated by the language to deliver a good performance. There was a world of difference between my imagination when reading the play and viewing a staged performance.  This film delivered the performance I'd hoped for and in the minor character of Osric, played by Robin Williams, upstaged my imagination. I loved it!<br /><br />The greatest surprise was the altered period of the setting. Medieval Gothic had been replaced by the 19th century. Someone, perhaps Mr. Branagh, had said the intent was to bring it closer to the audience but distant enough to make the elevated language acceptable. I thought that goal was achieved.<br /><br />The second surprise was the casting. I had been drawn to this film by a trailer that included Billy Crystal as the 2nd grave digger and was impressed by his acting. It was obvious to me this would not be a usual performance. Another casting surprise was Jack Lemmon as Marcellus and Robin William's part I've already mentioned. These Americans presented outstanding performances. But who would have imagined Julie Christi as Gertrude? She did a great job and I thought the entire cast delivered a memorable performance.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that had any sort of attraction to Hamlet.  At least one of the soliloquies - to be or not to be - may tire the less enthusiastic, but I was impressed by Branagh's delivery and consequently this was the only dialogue of length that &#34;stood out.&#34;
B001CEE1YE|5.0|It's been a few years now that \\"The Matrix\\" came out..still mystifies me. ARE we in the \\"Matrix\\"?? Sometimes I want OUT too! LOL! Here is something you will be suprised at...I was. I bought a 120hz tv (3D) and something suprising was goin on. The speed of the higher hertz slowed down the film to what one would call \\"Real Time\\". This \\"Real Time\\" makes all movies seem like you are 'on the Set' experiancing the movie as it's 'being filmed. Like a fifties teleplay.<br />  You actually start noticing things that are \\"Movie Fakery\\". It is after all Pretend..I know this. Its takes away from being \\"In the Movie\\" to Being on a set. You DO notice also that instead of characters portrayed actors...you find you are noticing its Actors portraying characters. It's Very strange. I get more into the Actors skill than the \\"Movie Magic\\". Next time you are at your local tv store check out any movie at 120hz.<br />The Matrix Trilogy\\" itself...AWESOME!<br />MovieMan
B004MC0FO8|5.0|awesome I give it a 5.I would definitely tell my friends about Shazamawesome the best areas awesome awesome awesomethe greatest
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this games  is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun you should get it it's entertaining. You'll luv it it's so exciting. When you get it rate it
B008G59IBI|5.0|I love the CD.  I can't help but wonder how Billie Joe pulled off producing songs about going to rehab while in rehab.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This Bingo game gives you a work out.  It is fast paced, not like the normal slow internet Bingo games I have played in the past.  I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to think fast when playing..
B008G59IKO|5.0|The band has matured in their music, vocals, and content (relative to earlier albums) and made three awesome albums at once.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My daughter and I have been playing bingo blitz for a while now and just absolutely love it..Thank you for such a great game.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|The author spends a great deal of time recapitulating the fighting between the Romans and the Jews.  The author is a historian, so this is not surprising.  He also claims that the entire story of the nativity in Bethlehem is false, without sufficient evidence.  It seems to me that the book was given a misleading title to promote readership.
B000TEPED0|5.0|have nothing but great things to say about the whole CD. Enjoy listening to it over and over again.Eric Church is one of my favorite new artist and country singers.
140006922X|5.0|This book met my expectations and more.  One cannot understand Jesus without some information on His life and times and th Roman Empire.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|When ZZ Top first started releasing their material on CD back in the late 80s and early 90s, I don't know what possessed them to re-record and remix most of their earlier catalog.  This boxed set brings those original mixes back to life.  All they did was remaster the original master tapes to bring out the full fidelity of the original versions.  The artwork is minimal (just the original album covers on CD sleeves) and there are no additional liner notes included with this set.  But, I only bought this collection for the music...more importantly, the SOUND of the music.  And it does sound pretty amazing!  Kudos to the Tres Hombres from Tejas!!!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I got this because my internet was being stupid so i tried to search something but it wouldnt work :&lt;
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is a great reproduction of the pc version of the same game. While there are still some much desired features yet missing from the mobile version hopefully its just a matter of time until those are also added. Being able to switch between creative and survival would be awesome.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|My security went crazy over this app so I took it off right away. I never had that before with any app so I don't want it.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|He's a cross between Dylan, Black Keys and Jet.... Not a bad combo. You should check him out and help get better music like this on the radio!!!<br /><br />As for the condition of the CD when I got it... perfect.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Grate Ideas, but with functional characters. Lacks charm and storytelling. A Sci-fi business guide. It is like Solitaire Mystery Light. Could not put it down though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so great I give it 5000000 stars I love it but it can be great for kids worlds best game right hear
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|So much fun to play. After the first few races I couldn't get enough of it! This game is kind of addicting. Wish they could a campaign mode or just to ride around and collect coins an d not only to do timed races. But overall  this game is great recommend for anyone!
B0001CCY7E|5.0|Beautiful music....excellent CD. This was well worth the money and gives hours of listening pleasure. Some of the most beautiful music is created for movies.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I like the fact you are playing with fellow uno lovers. Helps refine my uno skills. Going to recommend to all my friends. Maybe I will see you there!
B00CRQV1TY|4.0|The new songs are good and the old songs are given a new feel with the addition of artists from different genera.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I think its hard to get a comic book movie translated into movie - just look at Superman.  And Dredd does it right.  A dark gritty story, Karl Urban personifies Dredd in a such a fantastic way, it shows that a man can still act, even with only half his face visible at any given point.<br /><br />Interestingly, this isn't a story of world domination, Dredd isn't going up against a supervillian, life as we know it isn't at stake - and this made it feel more real.  Great story, nice visuals, and a fun gory time.  Really gory.  Not for the faint at heart.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Great intriguing movie fast paced with a strong creative base that entertains and amazes. The special effects are over the top
B00ATUFVDW|2.0|This movie is like a cartoon but with live actors.  For most of it, I figured Snow White and the Huntsman was intended for young children.  That was the level of writing.  But all of the death in the final battle scenes were nothing I'd take a youngster to.  So who was this for?  Too stupid for adults.  I would not recommend this movie to my friends and family.  The only thing that really stood out was how awkward Kristen Stewart looked on a horse.
B00BTZN91C|4.0|This is a great album. I love OneRepublic's unique sound and vocals. This is one of my favorite albums of theirs. I highly recommend it. There really aren't any tracks on the album that I get sick of.  Every song is worth listening to for sure!
0143119680|1.0|Diana is a super-brainy academic from old and respected witch family. Matthew is a super-old vampire who quickly becomes Diana's love interest and life controller. He assaults her, tells her when to eat and sleep, and she loves it.<br /><br />Basically, I couldn't get through the thin plot of this book and put up with the abusive dynamic in the relation of Matthew and Diana. The mystery of the book, the mysterious murder of Diana's parents, the back story of Matthew...none of it matters.<br /><br />I am disgusted that an educated woman would write a book like this that would have been much more appropriate if published in the 1950s. Books with abusive relationship dynamics that masquerade as romance are damaging and potentially brainwashing to young men and women everywhere. The first time Matthew laid hands on Diana and would not let go she should have called the cops, had him arrested, and obtained a restraining order.<br /><br />Complete and total ick from start to finish. Basically, this book is just like Twilight but with allegedly better academic provenance. I listened to this book on CD and endured half of the 20 CDs before I realized it was not going to get any better. It is sad that Harkness puts forth a pinata powerful female character who is smashed to bits by a controlling and angry man. Life is too short. Don't read bad books.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book really opened my eyes. I've recently had a spiritual awakening, and this book has helped re-enforce that whatever I look for is what I'm going to find. The only experiment that didn't work is the one where you're supposed to manifest something material. I tried to manifest a pair of diamond earrings, but they never materialized. I should point out this was the hardest experiment, it took me a while to think of something to manifest as I'm really not a materialistic person. I wonder if they never showed up because I didn't really care about getting them. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to change their life...an amazing, feel good read.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|I think that this installment had more heart, story, and just the right amount of action. I like to feel like I took a ride, not run a race when I watch these types of films. It has humor and a bit of bite. I am not a Marvel fan that will tell you how it doesn't work. To me a good movie takes you on an adventure without having a moment where you can't possibly suspend your disbelief enough to just experience it. I don't think this one ever pushes too far, while still being exhilarating through great action and consistent plot. I say just sit back and let the roller coaster go.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Written for a young audience but worthwhile for every parent, teacher, administrator, and student to read!!  Actually, as soon as one can read, read it!!
B005LAIIHG|1.0|My mom just bought this for me today and I just got done watching it. I was so bored to tears because it was not my kind of movie at all. It looked more like a foreign movie for kids. I do not wish to see this movie ever again. Sorry folks but I think I may give my copy away or sell it because I really do not want it. I didn't really want it to begin with. Peter Smith
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|This app is amazing it is great for schoolwork and work I would definitely recommend this app. If you are considering buying this app please do it is absolutely fantastic.
0064471837|5.0|I was in 8th grade when my school librarian mentioned an amazing book she'd picked up for the library.  I checked it out that day.  I finished it that night.  I literally could not put this book down.  Ten years later, this book has left enough of an impression on me that I'm actually talking to a tattoo artist about doing a full back piece based on The Old Kingdom Trilogy.<br /><br />This book was the first book, and certainly the first Young Adult novel, I'd ever picked up where the heroine stood on her own.  She was special because of something OTHER than the fact that she was female.  She was respected because of her achievements, not because she was female.  She was strong because she FOUGHT, not because she was female, and she had to WORK for every gain.  If I ever have a daughter, Sabriel will be required reading.<br /><br />A story that captivates, regardless of age, characters that make you WANT for there to be more after the last page, and come on, people, Tim Curry did the audiobook, how can you argue?<br /><br />Sabriel is NOT to be missed.
B00CVQYMB4|5.0|I love this book it has really has inspired. I would recommend for EVERYONE!!!!!! Happy READING!!!!!!!!!!!! Enjoy this collection I know I do!!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The beginning is spell binding but when the acne shifts out of Afghanistan it becomes much less interesting. Covering such a long number of years requires skipping over decades in time. I would have preferred a narrower focus in time. Still worth reading though.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator Plus is the complete calculator app I need for everything I do.  Everyone should have Calculator Plus on their android device!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|An awesome book continues right off where the first lleft off and furthered the story with new charecters. Kept me on the edge of my seat and I can't wait to get the next one!
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|very good DVD get additional get additional film on the DVD and  stories about the DVD and the characters and actors
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Itss fun I like to play it at night in bed bc it helps me relax and go to sleep
0316017930|4.0|The ideas proposed in this text seem revolutionary to how we generally view success. Though some facets may be a bit trite, like wealth and opportunity, the research and studies done to prove why these things among others are more likely to amount to success is incredibly intriguing. My only issue was that I kind of got the whole point half-way through the book, but I did appreciate Gladwell's style of personal vignettes backed by scientific research. For an AP Psych summer reading book, I think it is a fantastic choice as it is interesting and thought-provoking as well as an easy and good read.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Just love those little guys, they seem so real & love the interaction between them & the humans. Now I want Smurfs 2. I shared this movie with my whole family & they loved it also.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|My 8 year old son was stuck to this book until he finished it... and still reads it again sometimes.
B00402FGE4|5.0|I loved this series, did not care for the ending but I guess it had to end some way. Left it open to renewal of the series?
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Oh, this book was tedious. The courtroom \\"drama\\" was less than dramatic and it just dragged on and on. The premise of a \\"murder gene\\" never really got off the ground and some of the characters could have been brought to the front and the self-centered father was a bore.<br /> So sorry I spent the money. Even the ending was blah.<br /> If you enjoy courtroom scenes you might enjoy this, but you REALLY have to enjoy courtroom scenes.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Never got a chance to watch this when it was on TV but I bought it and it was a great series. A little to much in the Love hate segments, but over all a good series. Also bought the Caprica series and it explained a lot of how it all got started.
1401311091|5.0|If you are a fan of Castle, you will love this book. It reads just like an episode of the television show, and as usual, I didn't know who the killer was until the last few pages! I can't wait to read the rest of the books!
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I enjoyed the book and the writer's style.  The story was hilarious--sort of Forresst-Gumpish.  Just wish the<br />f-bombs were left out. No one, especially a GOOD writer, ever needs to use that word!!!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|It was a can't put down book for me and then was very excited to find I could watch a tv version.<br />I found the book to be well written and easy to follow and am glad Piper shared her story.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|A great childhood adventure we all wish we could have taken when we were kids and our parents weren't around to hassle us!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well written and interesting. I was into it right away and didn't want to put it down... in fact, I may not have! I will share this book or give it as a gift.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Memory of Light was a fine finale to the Wheel of Time series. I found myself sometimes reading at the hectic pace of the Final Battle and had to make myself slow down. Of courses, now I will suffer some withdrawal. Cheers to the late Robert Jordan who originally imagined the complexity that was The Wheel of Time, and high praise to Brandon Sanderson who wove himself into the fabric and tied off the weave without dropping a thread.
B0041D843M|5.0|Interesting and eye opening. I can't say it is a can't put it down book but I found I kept going back because I have never read so much info in one place. I made some changes!
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|I dated someone awhile ago very briefly who I defined as &#34;emotionally needy.&#34;  Ironically, I was defined as &#34;emotionally stunted.&#34;<br /><br />Granted, I'm a little bit more independent and don't rely on words of affirmation or gifts. But, at the time, I didn't know how to describe or articulate those things without sounding like an insensitive prick.<br /><br />Well, this book really helps. It's a very quick read. And, as a guy, it really helps open your eyes to what is really going on with your partner (and/or yourself).<br /><br />But just like any assessment, this book is only useful if you apply its principles. If you don't, then you will get nothing out of this.<br /><br />This book is obviously written to appeal to married couples, but it can be applied to anyone in a relationship. This is a very interesting read for anyone in the dating scene (which is everyone not currently married).<br /><br />So, before you load up your dating app, it might be worth discovering what makes you tick, relationally, in order to better define compatibility... aside from you both having the same taste in music.<br /><br />Overall, a great book, a quick read, and a very introspective look at what you can offer in a relationship, and what you need in return. All that said, I'm giving this book 3 stars because, apparently, the author recently released a free online assessment that renders purchasing this book somewhat pointless.
B0000024JN|5.0|This album is just as good now as it was 20+ years ago. Every song is a hit in my opinion!!
B00CUHMZOK|5.0|Andre & his Orchestra are absolutely the best available music<br />that I have found.  They play meaningful AND beautiful music.<br />The Audience, the Orchestra AND Andre are all enjoying<br />themselves and the result is fabulous.  Keep them coming.<br />LarryN.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was wonderfully written, giving the reader a visual of all that is going on. It is captivating and a book you can't put down. I MUST get the other two books in this series!
B003B02O0A|3.0|I thought I had read this years ago.  Turns out, I saw the movie.  The book was not quite as good, and I don't often say that.  It was just soooo slow.  The story was intriguing, but the pacing was off.  It took me a lot longer to get through this book than most.  On the bright side, it was really informative.  In fact, it was so informative that a few weeks after reading it, I began a introductory law course and I know everything the professor is talking about thus far.
B0044E9LW6|5.0|This is a review of the first cd of this 2 cd set. unbelievable is the word !! Vivian shreds like no other guitarist.This live release captures the energy of the studio albums with Vivian! Children of the sea is played in a different style, a gentle, dreamy like version. Holy diver is great as rainbow in the dark. Stargazer is another stand out track!!If you dont have this you are missing out on some live stuff with Vivian. What happen to him after dio who knows.
B00ECU1A6C|5.0|My kids loved it! My Little Pony is a favorite in our household and we'll rent more My Little Pony movies as they come out.
B006OITIQE|5.0|Great music! They have put together a great CD and I am so happy they are in a group together.  Thank you Simon Cowell!
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|Great special effects, but hey... nothing a big budget cannot provide. Great cast as well, but I will again refer to the aforementioned. What a big budget cannot always provide is a good, intelligent script. This has got to be one of the worst films I've seen this summer for several reasons:<br /><br />1. IMDB somehow has this film rated 7.1 stars, which is pretty high and usually spot on in terms of what I agree with. That's how I got roped into watching it in the first place. I'm left scratching my head on how it got 7.1 stars!<br />2. The premise of the plot is almost blatant propaganda. Geared toward angst-filled teenagers and Occupy-minded individuals, the plot is all about how sweet revenge is, based on themes of wealth-redistribution. Couple that with the intrigue of joining secret societies. The dialog is over the heads of most teens, and far too boring at times to keep their attention. My 2 teenage kids left to do other things after 20 minutes into the flick which, after watching the whole thing (hoping it would somehow get better) had me relieved.<br /><br />Not worth the time to watch. Seriously, pass on this one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is awesome!i really like thg and divergent and I think this is great too.  Defiantly recommend this! .
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I have not watched the Netflix show but, bought the book on the shows positive reviews. It seemed to be a sugar coated version on prison and its monotony. Yes, the author points out her mistakes and the affect it potentially had on her fellow inmates but, it it really fell flat overall.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is a great movie that follows pretty close to the book and is a great addition to the Lord of the Rings series. Perfect for any fantasy lover.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book it leaves you in suspense in every chapter! After I read the first chapter I didn't want to put it down!
B008RXYOKY|4.0|This does its job. I do wish it was designed differently, however, so that it would allow for better/less obtrusive extension from the computer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can be frustrating to try and get out of the room. Boy, what an accomplishment when you figure it out. Spent a month on one of the rooms , but when I figured it out I wanted to yell ALRIGHT!! Can't wait to get to another level. Plan on some free time cause it takes patience, and you don't wanna start all over on the level if you close it for a while.  Happy gaming.
098478280X|3.0|I haven't read this book. However, as I was browsing through the preview content on Amazon I stumbled upon the book's implementation of the singleton pattern in Java. All I can say is, Joshua Bloch would not approve of this implementation and might even reject a candidate who offers up the implementation contained in this book. That's not to say that this book is not useful overall. I ran into this little imperfection and thought it was worth sharing. You now have one more data point than you had before to help you make your decision. Think of it as a litmus test. I jumped to a topic that I am reasonably familiar with, looked at the treatment in the book, and wasn't satisfied. Candidates should be expected to offer the currently accepted best singleton implementation, not one that was a best practice 5 years ago.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like beacause it is FREE.And I love the Vector. battles basically you will win Mionion of the Year
B007I2BYX0|5.0|Great hard rock sound and she has an amazing voice.  This is live, so you don't get the clear studio sound, but instead get the energy of a live show.  Nice selection of songs, all pretty good and good intro to the band.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I am absolutely gobsmacked by the other reviewers on here who call David Mitchell's writing \\"brilliant.\\" Are they reading the same words I read in this book? Because the writing in here can be cringe-worthy, if not downright laughable. After watching 3 hours of Cloud Atlas, the movie, we downloaded the book onto my Kindle from the library, curious to see if the book expounded upon any of the confusing questions left from the movie. Unfortunately. it was clear from a quick skim of the contents that the confusing film actually did a good job of *clarifying* the purposefully opaque novel. We actually read snippets of some of the stories to each other and had a good laugh at how ridiculous and bad the writing was. None of the writing rang true...the \\"Riddley Walker\\" style writing for the post-apocalyptic future was too clever for its own good and hard to read. (And it's been done before. Many times.) The first story set back in the slave trading days was a poor representation of language from that day and did not ring \\"true-true\\" as Zachry might have said. Frobisher's tale was pretentious and lacking in purpose. Somni's futuristic world seemed mostly delineated by using \\"x\\" instead of \\"ex\\" in words, and other cute turns of phrase, but these window dressings otherwise did not cover up the 3rd-grade reading level the prose was written at.<br /><br />It actually saddens me that critics loved this book and gave it a prize. It makes me concerned that we are truly living in an Idiocracy, where people are so unable to discern quality from hype that the worst trash gets elevated as art.<br /><br />To be fair, I don't think this book is *total* trash. It is, like the movie, mediocre and confusing, and perhaps entertaining, if you enjoy slogging through the language. (However, after going through the book, the movie is 10 times better!) Words should be written to clearly express meaning, not twisted to be purposefully hard to decipher, just to make the book seem smarter than it is. That is not good writing - it is bad writing.<br /><br />I actually took some time to read snippets of the various stories to see if somehow my initial judgment was a bit harsh - but every snippet I read was dull, overwrought, and hardly compelling. In the end, I decided not to read the whole book. It just didn't seem worth it. And trust me, I have read some really bad, trashy books - like some of the \\"Left Behind\\" series - books that are badly written and also cringe-worthy. But even the Left Behind books have an interesting antagonist as the anti-Christ to liven up the pious proselytizing...and there's a PLOT.<br /><br />The *only* reason I am giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 is that I did not read the entire thing and maybe you learn to overlook the bad writing as you get into it.<br /><br />PS I was also disappointed to see that the threads of \\"reincarnation\\" in the book are even more tenuous than in the film. Score one to the Wachowskis for taking a flawed product and turning it into something a little more profound than the original.
B00DHHWYAW|1.0|The movie is basically ruined by a music soundtrack that is completely alien to the story. The story has as an essential back drop the wild jazz age of the late 1920's the music breaks that feeling that the story is so focused on.<br />The story itself is only loosely based on the original book. I wouldn't watch the movie as a way of getting away from reading the book for a class. Still it would have been an okay movie, if it wasn't for the music.<br />The music kills the movie for me. Please don't get me wrong, I love pop music as much as anyone else, and have a few rap albums in my collection, the music just does not fit the 1920's story.
B00AIBZM40|4.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater and it's just as entertaining on my mini home theater.  Great use of audio special effects.  If you have a blu ray player and decent speakers and audio component setup that can utilize the Dolby Master track this is a must buy film!<br /><br />Two thumbs up!<br />LL
0817439390|4.0|The content of this book is fairly easy to follow.  My youngest son enjoyed all the great photography.  Even if his shots do not improve his love for photography has.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The most amazing game in the world it teaches you how to train and take care of a horse it is just heartwarming
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book shows how one secret can touch so many live. The book was a nice and easy read. Everything blended so nicely and feel right in place. Th end of the book went through senerios of what might have been, which was a nice touch.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|OK it started as TV series, than interesting interview, and finally the book. The book gives us peeping to the life in women's prison, but a lot of scenes can happen in our &#34;regular&#34; life's too
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Anyone who has played the Facebook version of this game will find little to no difference in this app compared to the facebook version of it, Which is a little disappointing. I'd have expected them to at least add something to attract new users and keep old ones. Nothing special, I'll stick with the old Angry Birds.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|Played on the Galaxy Note 2. The graphics are good and pretty much what I expected from the screen shots. I have a few really games I play on my computer and the style of graphics is similar. The main thing is getting used to the controls and how it affects driving. Sliding through the turns is a little different when playing a racing game.<br /><br />On my Note 2, it almost seems like the game play is a little in slow motion. It's not that the game lags, but more that I'm used to playing faster racing games, so running through the course seems to be a little slower than I expected. Whether that is something to be expected in this type of game, or something the developer can improve later, I'm not sure.<br /><br />For the most part, I've enjoyed playing it.
B00CLD671A|5.0|It was great to be able to share the most recent season of Downton Abbey with family members who are new to the series. I enjoyed seeing the season again to be able to catch scenes I missed during the past season.
B008469DGY|5.0|Nice diversion on a long trip Why does it look like a dirty word in the background? distracting, not funny
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's great and all plus the earning points thing is a bonus but a bit odd for weather app. But I admit I am hooked on it now for that very reason. The best weather part is the hourly b forecast.  That's what I  look at the most..
B007N85POS|5.0|fun stuff, for a while, keeps the wife quiet, why would I write about this? blah blah blah blah ect
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I'm on the kindle fire version, and I can agree with other comments when they say that the gameplay is fun, but was too greedy to actually improve it. Every time, I get to scootaloo, get bored, and stop playing. About an hour into the game, buying land goes from 500 bits to 240000 bits or 89 gems. I am one of The most hardcore bronies I know(not enough to go against the overly attached) and I can actually say that I enjoy this game, but regret owning it. I was wearing a Derpy Hooves T-shirt when I wrote this.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|We are enjoying the intrigue, the twists and turns of the plots and the development of the characters.<br /><br />It is nice to watch a show without the bad language and still have action.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|good book, seemed truthful and kept my attention. Easy to follow<br />would definately recommend as a quick and easy<br />pool side read
0385738781|2.0|This is how it went;<br />The 'maze runner' characters were great, i had no problem falling in love them, but the maze is why you're gonna wanna read it - it's the mystery to solve.... But then you finish reading it and realize that there is no point to the maze. Bummer, but ok, you're gonna wanna read the sequel ASAP.<br />I liked 'scorch trials' too, you love the remaining characters even more and it had this whole 'resident evil' vibe going on: evil corporation the cause of the infection, running horrible experiments and creating monsters, all the while the main player has to get through all these obstacles to reach the cure for the infection.... BUT THEN, you reach the end and discover that there is no cure. Again, there was no point to the whole thing!<br />'Death cure'- nothing's resolved, things prove to impossibly get worse and worse, hope is lost, the best character is killed, and more questions. And just when it's finally all over, you find out that it was ALL FOR NOTHING. Before the end, Thomas is conveniently taken out of all of the never ending horror into paradise, but before that last page, the author is in time to punch you in the face one last time when you find out that Thomas got used yet again by someone he trusted. By the end, you just feel like a shucking clunk slinthead for believing in hope.<br />Conclusion: there is no point to this series.
0316044695|5.0|This book not only makes you feel like you are right there but it makes you realize just what our boys and girls in uniform go through to serve and protect our country. If you don't shed a tear when reading this book I will be amazed.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love the movies and now that i can play the game... its like im actually there! I love this game!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|this game is great for children and i enjoy it as well. you can play without using money but it takes time and patience.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I had this app for a few months then when I'd open it it'd be black. So I'm redownloading it and hoping it will work this time!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is so fun. i like all of the angry bird games. i like the different places you go
B000FC1MCS|5.0|It was a really interesting and the way the book is made in first person makes it even much better.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|this game begins pretty easy but gets very challenging very quickly. i enjoy puzzle games and i have even had some trouble figuring things out
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|So far I haven't had to buy anything. Didn't realize it but i started at the beginning of a movie and its almost over. I say that to say time has past me by without noticing it. So far so good!!
B003RNXIBK|2.0|ugh<br />this is more general than just talking about this specific album, but overall this album made me even more realize that eminem needs to:<br />1)  stop screaming<br />2)  stop singing<br />3)  stop talking about how everyone hates him, the price of fame, blah blah<br />4)  start rapping in his old rap voice from SSLP and MMLP<br />5)  appease his core fans that were there from the beginning with the same witty lyricism he was first known for.  the most important word there being &#34;witty&#34;<br />6)  get some hotter beats that aren't made by him or dre (yes i said it), and that fit his style<br />7)  stop trying to be a technical whiz at rapping and go back to the witty content that i liked before (see number 5)<br />i don't know what else to say, i felt like i wasted my money on this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ok, just like you I look at the reviews before getting a game, and this defiantly is the PERFECT GAME!!! It's so much fun, have a blast!!
B000000HHE|4.0|this album is like...  i wish these dudes raps were easier to pick up.  that was always my problem with de la vs. groups like tribe - they don't seem as instantly accessible to me.  maybe others don't have that problem.  still, this album is dope for beats.  prince paul did his thing on this one.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great.  Took me some time to get the location correct.  The GPS was missing bu 200 miles, but I finally got all the settings correct and no problems since.
B000005Z0E|3.0|the next album &#34;strictly 4 my...&#34; is way better.  you can tell he's still trying to find his style in this one, couple of offbeat flows or raps where he's trying to fit too much into a bar, beginner mistakes.  plus the beats are garbage - i think this kind of plagued pac even on his hits, but this album probably has the wackest beats, imo.  on the other hand, its pac!  when he's on a tear, his rapping is really good on this album, he's even got some das-efx-ish rapid fire flows going on at points.  also the mixing is terrible, can't hear vocals on a lot of tracks all that well
B00CLMA3HK|5.0|I blew through this this thing (220 pages) in a couple nights!  I read things for one reason - to be entertained -- and this book completely fulfilled that tall order.  And I've been reading fantasy and sci-fi for over forty years now so I have some pretty high standards if I do say so myself.  This book takes some actual historical facts and then blends a story into them which is a wonderful way to write a science-fiction book.  In a way it reminds me kind of like Stephen R. Donaldson's series about Thomas Covenant (\\"Lord Foul's Bane\\", etc.).  The adventures of Jesse, James, and Marcus are well developed and flow right along but I don't want to give any of the details away -- that wouldn't be fair to you!  The only frustration I have is waiting for the next installment in the series...........
B0000024K1|3.0|there's a couple good tracks on here - i like chuck d's voice although the rhymes could use some more, well, rhymes.  this was one of those albums where the beats are like a james brown loop or similar, with a high pitch squeal over it, maybe a whistle or vocal sample or something like that.  that was really popular back in the day.  when they get it right, it sounds perfect on this album.  otherwise there's many skippable tracks - it just doesn't stand the test of time for me.  listen thru the previews first and decide if you still wanna drop money on this
B0085TJUGI|2.0|There are some very good points,like the part about cancer and western medicine.  The part about no judgement is very misleading. She didn't get to stay long enough to learn other than love in the Spirit World.  If there were no laws and no accountability there would be utter chaos and suffering. No judgement means no justice.  Others having NDEs have been taught much more.
B0000024LN|5.0|this album is THE album if you like redman.  the sparse, bass-heavy beats are perfect for him to get busy over.  there's not a lot i can say, if you want to hear redman at his peak, grab this one right away!
B00C7L8DM2|3.0|Acting was generally good in this movie. The plot was far fetched. At one point, I wished I were spending time watching a Bourne movie because that is far fetched but at least plausible fiction, if that makes sense. However, the beautiful scenery was worth the time spent on Erased.
B0000024JN|4.0|this one has some classics on it, definitely worth the buy just for that.  lot of 808 and rock riffs going on.  which isn't a bad thing.  i could listen to the more 808ish tracks over and over.  if you like beastie boys, you should probably cop this
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I was very skeptical about watching this show, especially after having Sherlock Holmes played in theaters by Robert Downey, Jr. I put on the first show and haven't stopped watching it since!  I also own the whole first season which is very unusual for me to buy a season one show at a time!<br /><br />I highly recommend it for everyone in the family!  It is great and the actors give top notch performances!!
B00006674X|5.0|I stumbled on this film once by accident many years ago. and found it about the best movie Elvis Presley ever made.  If you can imagine Mary Tyler Moore as a nun, then you can probably imagine Presley as a public services physician who plays a cool guitar at a Catholic folk mass.  This one is a sleeper.  I'm glad to have it in my dvd library.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It needs a lot of new features,updates,upgrades,and items.<br />Who ever created this game should have a award from the people who played it.
B001QB5S3G|5.0|Got this movie because I used the song in my wedding ,not knowing it was from a movie.<br />Beautiful movie.
B004HYXW1O|5.0|I may be biased because I love everything by The Script, but this is a beautiful album. I love every song because they each speak to me in a different way....Danny is such a passionate singer and draws you into the story.....
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is one of the best, most addicting apps that I have used.I have told others about all as well.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|John Legend does not disappoint! This album is truly amazing! Been playing on repeat since I purchased. My two favorites are The Beginning, and I am addicted to Made to Love. This song is orgasmic for me!!!!! Truly worth the wait!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The DVD/ bluray combo is great and it is a great film. Christopher Nolan did it again with this one!
B0063M22QO|4.0|Levels start out easy and get harder. It was a little confusing changing between modes - I would get an error message saying I hadn't completed enough levels. Once I figured out I just had to hit the Previous button it all worked out. If you like Mahjongg or are just learning, this app provides a lot of entertainment.
140053271X|4.0|Wish the screen were a bit brighter & that current books were available for less. It works great though and I'm looking forward to leaving heavy hardback books at home.
B002N2SYAG|5.0|I enjoy the scientific background of the show and the witty banter that ties it all together as a show.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love playing this game,however it's gotten harder to get bingos, we have limitations on our mailboxes, the power ups are way too expensive now, the ungiftable items should be gotten rid of (this is supposed to be a social game)increase xp points received, increase daily credits received. Fix this and I'll gladly rate 5 stars. Credits cost way too much
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! Can't get enough of this game!!!!! I LOVE THIS AND BOTH THE MOVIES!!IT'S SO FLUFFY!!Its awesome
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Wasn't familiar with this Musical beforehand, but being a huge Cyndi Lauper fan I just had to hear this cd. Absolutely love the songs. Well done Cyndi for writing such a great Musical. Am hoping that Kinky Boots will soon come to the UK so I can go and see it live.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I think the plot of this book was very creative and many in our group did not see what was coming.  I think everyone will enjoy the twist that happens about 3/4 ways thru the book.  Don't quit reading before you find out who the 'killer' is.
B00BWDJILG|4.0|When reading some of the reviews here, I'm reminded of the old parable in which a young wolf and an old wolf are surveying a flock of sheep from the top of a hill. The young wolf says, \\"Hey, let's run down their and eat  one of those sheep.\\" To which the old wolf replies, \\"No, let's walk down there and eat them all.\\"  The original story is about bulls and is a little cruder, but this is Amazon. ;-)<br /><br />I think \\"Walking Shadows\\" shows how utterly self-assured and purposeful Redman has become. This is a very mature piece of work and it fits nicely in his catalog.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|I can relate to Ben Green in some ways I hear voices in my heard usually they are my annoying family members, but seriously I think he is just an average guy who seems to be unwantedly stuck with a special gift. As far as Detective Summers she is one craft lady intelligent, clever, and quick on her toes although she hates the people she works with ( which I think a lot of people can relate to.) she uses her environment and experience to get to the bottom of this gut wrenching thriller. Jams Roses did an excellent job. This book had me on the edge of my seat and biting my nails in suspense. On top of that the majority of the story was unpredictable especially the end.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun easy to play and understand the game. ENJOY PLAYING EVERY EVENING WITH MY LITTLE ONE, SHE LOVES ALL THE ANIMALS.
0061537969|5.0|Excellent story.  A heart felt love of animals and dogs in particular is what is reflected in this story.  It is very heart wrenching and makes you wonder about the other creatures that inhabit this earth.  A great read for pre-teens to adults.  It could be a chapter book for early readers grades 3 and up.  I highly recommend this book.  Especially if you have faith there is more to this world than meets the eye of ordinary man.
B00742GBDM|1.0|I am not a screenwriter so i may not completely understand or fully appreciate the challenges writers face when adapting a classic like Mansfield Park to the big screen. When the allotted time 112 minutes, the writer has the delicate task of making the story more concise, and walking the fine line between  maintaining the character of the novel and  preserving the author's plot line.  I expect a bit of embellishment, a few subtle changes and perhaps a new character or two. Had i not read the book, i would have enjoyed this version thoroughly......unfortunately, i decided to watch this movie after i finished reading the book. As I watched the movie, i realized that i  could not relate what i was watching to what i had just read. The characters bear the same names as those in the book, but that is where the resemblance  ends. The film alters major elements of the story to make room for Austen's private letters which had nothing to do with the story or the book. Jane Austen has been criticized for her apathy towards slavery so to address this question, the producers decided to add a sub-plot to make sure that the viewer understood that Jane Austen abhorred slavery. Missing also  is Austen's satirical social commentary. If you are an Austen purist, you will hate this one....i will stick with BBC or A&E productions when it comes to beloved classics.
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|Great book - well written and easy to understand.<br />Interesting facts came to light - historical dates/timelines made this a most informative book.<br />Recommended to all historians and WWII 'buffs',
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|I just learned about Twenty One Pilots a few months ago and now I can't stop listening to this album.  It is fantastic and I have many favorite tracks (including #5 - Car Radio as my all time fave)!

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|well done movie about a girl and her family surviving an awful tragedy.  It appears to be telling an accurate story - no gratuitous drama.
B000LXHK22|5.0|This is a beautiful film which is a good portrayal of life in Provence.  Having lived in France for 31 years it brought tears to my eyes reminding how wonderful those years were.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I've loved every season and the progression of each character. I always feel sad when I've finished watching a season.
B00A0NOF7G|1.0|I love cozy mysteries & this one sounded interesting so I purchased it for my Paperwhite. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It started out well, but I was unpleasantly surprised to encounter a glaring spelling error (really a misused word) early in the book. I continued to find dozens of misspelled words & grammatical errors throughout the book. Maybe I'm a &#34;grammar Nazi&#34; but it made it impossible to concentrate on the story. Even disregarding the grammar & spelling errors, the book itself wasn't all that good. Too short & very little character development. The plot was thin also & the ending almost contrived. I finished the book & even read the next two in the series, but only because I had already purchased them. The next two were just as bad. Very, very disappointed. Unless Miss Dobbs has polished her grammar & writing skills, I won't be reading any more of her books & I definitely will not recommend them.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I  was so excited yet so broken hearted by the ups and downs.  i cant wait to see what season 4 brings!!
B006CHML4I|1.0|As I have written in other areas of Amazons web site, this item was not part of the order received from Ups, as the parcel was damaged. I reported it to Ups weeks ago & ups was resolving it directly with Amazon. I have been given no confirmation & I am out the watch & $$. Not a good report so far !!
0812984412|5.0|In terms of satisfying oddness, I'd rank Cloud Atlas level with Mark Helpin's Winter's Tale, Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, or John Fowles' The French Lieutenant's Woman. Especially the latter, as the book likes to play with interlocking narratives--past, present, future. It contains six loosely interrelated stories, as others have noted, moving from the 1800s (historical drama a la Melville) to the far future (sci-fi in a dialect somewhere between Trainspotting and Clockwork Orange with Cormac McCarthy's The Road as a backdrop).<br /><br />I saw the movie first, which made the book more understandable. But it could have easily worked the other way around. As movie versions always do, the film had to gloss over more than a few intricacies of the book, although the gist was the same. The theme of imprisonment/oppression within a System of Haves and Have-Nots holds it all together--with a healthy dose of reincarnation thrown in--but it's the inventiveness of the plots and originality of the language that kept me involved. It's been said of Mark Twain that he never wrote a dull sentence, and I'd have to say the same applies to David Mitchell's writing.<br /><br />Just to keep this review from being too glowing, there was one jarring moment when a cloned woman a hundred years from now watches \\"one of the greatest movies ever\\" from the early 21st century: The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish, which just happens to be the title of the previous chapter in the book. Seriously? It would have made AFI's top 100 films of all time? It just seemed a bit of a forced connection with the previous story, thrown in at the end like a raw bone to a dog. But this was just one instance of the novel's postmodern playfulness--a frank undermining of the believability of one narrative frame of reference by another.<br /><br />Whether or not you have a taste for this sort of thing, the novel still works as a collection of six novellas--all of which are good reads ontheir own. I haven't read many books over the summer, but I'm glad I picked up Cloud Atlas. Keep reading, my friends!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I often try to buck the trend and hope to dislike books that we are told to like by major publishers, even though I'm often wrong.  I was delightfully wrong in this case, as well.  This was an excellent second part to the series, and introduces some compelling new characters.  The ending was enough of a cliffhanger that it made me want to immediately start the third book, which I have.  I still believe that the subject matter is a little dark and slightly inappropriate for children under twelve, but for anyone older than that, the story is great.  Overall, an excellent read!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well written, interesting characters, and fascinating twists and turns. I enjoy the futuristic setting, the interplay between characters, and continually looked forward to see what happened next. Highly recommended.
B004EPYZXK|5.0|Great purchase price and buying any products from them helps others! Product was exactly as described, so one cannot go wrong!

B00BV1P8NG|5.0|Very solidly built figure, no hollow spaces here. My only complaint is that the cutie mark is not on both sides, only the right side.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Tom Cruise produced and starred in this film, the story line was great, but just way too much Tom Cruise, who is way to into himself, and it is completely obvious during this entire movie. Waste of my money.
B002DS3982|4.0|This movie is a great movie addressing social issues like racism and corruption in the justice system. The movie was clear and came on right away after the purchase.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I think a writer being centered is key,. When I read Reza Asian was first a Muslim then converted to Pentecostal and converted everything that didn't move then reconfirmed his Muslim beliefs, I realized this guy is a mess. He simply doesn't know who he is. It effects his writing. Although Zealot is interesting, it suffers from a lack of continuity and connection similar to its writer.

B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|So much fun. Highly addictive. I play this more than candy saga. Wish I could get it on my mobile phone.
B0097EWK3A|2.0|This game sucks they cut you off just when things are getting juicy  listen to the other reviews . IT'S COOL at first but they expect you to pay 2.99 for the second half ! by the way not good for children blood guns and knives involved ! Plus a creepy old man.
B005IMHBI4|3.0|It isn't the film. The film is awesome. The packaging leads me to believe I got a knock off DVD and I am not pleased at all. Especially with the price I paid.
B00EAI9CSY|4.0|Neil Jordan has a great visual style and his handling of this story was very interesting. The two lead actresses through themselves into their roles giving sexy , sad and emotional performances. The shots on the island were really beautiful and mysterious. Gemma is a babe too  :)
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|super funy movie...i loved...i have wanted to see this movie since a while a long and now i finnaly did it
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|The plot rambles and is disjointed, the characters are not convincing in themselves or in their interaction with each other.  It felt like a vehicle for the author to try to make a political point about the loss of personal freedoms in a security-obsessed Britain with its all-knowing Foreign Office and the usual, shadowy, omnipotent, US privately run intelligence operation.  Not very imaginative but it may appeal to those who share his views.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy this. (I took of one star as it was an excellent movie, a little predictable, and not quite \\"Sixth Sense\\" stunning).<br /><br />a well laid out plot with a good mix of drama, illusion and action.  Mixed with enough counterplay between the different Egos as it goes along. Does leave you realising what it is that draws you into the world of magicians like David Copperfield. You know its a trick, you know its slight of hand, misdirection and illusion, yet for the life of you you cant figure out how they do these things.<br /><br />Mr Morgan Freeman plays his role of Know it all Magician debunker well, as well as filling in the backstory and moving the plot along so you know that the story is about more than just the tricks. Woody does well as the manipulative mentalist who is just a little too far over the line. Jesse plays the rather neurotic and controlling magician, with just a few hints of the controlling role he played in the social network, and Ms Fisher did well as the harry houdini escapologist.<br /><br />all in all a fun movie. Brought to a great climax, although not a complete closure.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Very few albums have a song track where all of them are really good. I wish he would have come out with this much earlier. But well worth the wait. I was pleasantly surprised. THis is not Cinderalla but Tom Keifer
0670014893|4.0|In the present atmosphere of clandestine operations, the result of which the public has been ill-informed and too often kept in the dark, John Le Carre has fashioned a novel built around a bungled black op covered up for three years.  The story begins with the hatching of \\"Operation Wildfire,\\" comprising British special force soldiers and American mercenaries employed by a private company.  The aim is to capture an arms dealer who, according to intelligence, is to visit the British colony of Gibraltar.<br /><br />A Foreign Office functionary is selected to be the on-the-spot eyes-and-ears for a minister of Her Majesty, nominally in charge of the operation.  Like many such actions, it results in failure, but is declared a total success, despite the fact that two innocents are killed and the subject never captured.  Three years later, various persons, directly or tangentially, separately begin to question the silence and attempt to uncover the facts.  The promised \\"transparency\\" never seems to arrive.<br /><br />After a somewhat muddled beginning, in which Mr. Le Carre jumps all around, a bit confusing to the reader, he begins to move the plot straightforwardly and with dispatch.  The author raises the basic question of right and wrong, also lambasting the use of private armies to wage \\"little wars\\" around the globe and old boy networks where mistakes are covered up and witnesses bought off.  A topic that is, unhappily, very timely.<br /><br />Recommended.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|When I first discovered this game it was on facebook. I started out just playing once in a while to pass the time. I quickly became an addict when I started leveling up and earning more credits. I now play daily. The only downside is that the app has a tendancy to freeze or not work at all sometimes on my kindle and ipad.
B001F6ZIXC|4.0|\\"Riding through this world all alone<br />God takes your soul, you're on your own<br />The crow flies straight, a perfect line<br />On the Devil's Bed until you die\\"<br />Curtis Stigers et al<br /><br />My son-in-law turned me onto 'Sons Of Anarchy' pretty late in the game. I have viewed Season one and am about to start season two. I am now part of the family. And, what a family this is!<br /><br />The 'Sons of the Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original,' or SAMCRO. It is essential to know the acronyms, so you understand what the club is all about. It started as a club for Iraq Vets who didn't belong anywhere, and it turned into a gun running, violent family group of bikers.  They live in Charming, Ca, yes, I know! Charlie Hunnam plays Jax Teller, the youngest of the regulars, son of the club's originator, who died under curious circumstances. His mother, Gemma, played brilliantly by Katey Sagal,  is remarried to the President of the club, Clay Morrow, played by Ron Perlman. Several members of the club are people you recognize, Mark Boone Junior plays a wannabe Elvis, tough guy. Kim Coates plays the hit man, not someone to get on the wrong side. And others come and go.<br /><br />The storyline is to keep the town of Charming, crime free, except, of course, the gun running and the killing of competitive motorcycle clubs and other bad guys. The local Sherriff is on the club's payroll as are other members of the police. Nice, simple little town, but, of course, it isn't. The ATF comes to town with a woman determined to bring the club down, and another stalker ATF man, goes after one of te biker's girls.  Lots of stories and they are good. Realistic, most of them, but the ones that aren't, you just overlook those parts. The acting is superb, characters full of life, and I understand that many real motorcycle clubs follow SOA, Sons Of Anarchy.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 09-08-13

0064471837|5.0|This is my favorite book! I've retread it so many times the spine is going. This booked was my introduction into fantasy novels and my love of everything Garth Nix.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|I'm not one for sequel's, but this is an excellent one. He starts with a premise that just sounds boring, but manages to turn it into a tale of intergalactic import. A few schmaltzy, sentimental moments only slightly taint. More than worth the read.
B0076DELIG|5.0|If you like Suspense you will love the Harry Bosch series of books. The Black Box is another well written story that contains great Storytelling and content. Can't wait for the next Story.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|Released in 1938, The Adventures of Robin Hood was the top box office film of the year. A major part of its success was due to the full-color \\"three-strip\\" Technicolor process, a technology that would secure its hold on the viewing public the very next year with The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. Robin Hood was lavish entertainment, with heartthrob Errol Flynn as Robin and Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian. A host of fine actors contributed to this film, including Claude Rains as the treacherous Prince John, Basil Rathbone as evil Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Eugene Pallette as Friar Tuck, and Alan Hale as Little John. In a casting of some note, Marian's horse was portrayed by Trigger, the palomino of Roy Rogers fame.<br /><br />Although utilizing numerous stage sets, Robin Hood also incorporated outdoor scenes from California parks for Sherwood Forest. The cumbersome Technicolor cameras had to be trucked into the field, but the vivid colors and Technicolor's resistance to fading over the years made the awkwardness worthwhile. Needing intense light for filming, Technicolor required that \\"night\\" scenes be shot in daylight, then darkened in the lab. But the darkening could not conceal the fluffy daytime clouds, or the sharp shadows.<br /><br />In the climactic confrontation between Robin Hood and Sir Guy, watch as Errol Flynn pursues Basil Rathbone through an open doorway inside the castle. Outside the doorway Robin's sword is noticeably bent, but once through the doorway it is straight.<br /><br />Old color films benefit greatly from a high-definition restoration, and they don't come much older than this one. It retains the ability to entertain even today, 75 years after it was made. The restored Blu-ray video is superb, the monaural sound is clean and functional.  Given its classic story, great cast, and place in Hollywood history, this movie is a worthy addition to a film fan's collection.
B004FGMDOQ|1.0|I hardly finished the book, and I'm the kind of avid reader that devours nearly anything with pages. I wouldn't have minded the bizarre concept if it were written with less cliche and resolved through anything shy of deus ex machina, but really, I was never engrossed in the book because I was so distracted by the quality of the writing. That really detracts from a reader's experience.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Very versatile mount. I plan on adding a couple of ball mounts to my track bike so i can mount my GoPro in different locations.

Good insight into the cultural background. Impressive. Have also read another and looking at other scandinavian authors.
0880793082|5.0|93,<br />The art is gorgeous, and the symbolism is fascinating. I recommend Lon Duquette's book Understanding Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot. A very powerful tool for powerful magicians.

1469220482|2.0|I wanted to see what all the ruckus was about. I have read several of Ms. Day's books that I really enjoyed. But I guess it is not my style. If you are into contemporary romance, you may like this. Mostly, to me it is just an incomplete story that hopes to sell the next book in the series.

0385349947|4.0|I wonder if the author is using the term \\"men\\" globally or for white men in particular. I find as a man of color that her assumptions are primarily about white men. Her illustrations of success are primarily about white women. Black women have been leaders for a long time--but have not had access. The author has  had money, education and networks. She has also has had access--and now wants ownership. Many women of color are just trying to get in the door--and men of color as well. I would just like her to say white men have been keeping white women from advancing--then I could take her more seriously in her arguments. Her research also is limited a study here and a study there.<br /><br />R.C.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really enjoy this author. You learn a lot about other countries while enjoying a wonderfully written story. I highly recommend.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|So far the story is solid with good graphics. The puzzles are challenging and are doable.  It leads you to where you need to go and doesn't leave you wondering what to do next.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I'm enjoying the game but I wish energy would not deplete so fast and that there was an easier way to get diamonds. Also I don't like the in-app purchasing. On the whole its an interesting game.
0064471837|5.0|When I first read this book I was in the third grade. A little young but even back then I was reading adult written books such as Lilian Jackson Braun and Dean Koontz. Reading this the first few times I fell in love with the aspect behind the bells personally. The characters, The beginning of the world written and told in such a way that as I'm reading you can picture in your head each of the characters. I was rooting for The main couple the entire way through the trilogy and couldn't stop reading till I reached the end and the last word of the last book.<br /><br />There are some flaws no one is a perfect writer but the reason some books are worth reading over others is that you can get past those flaws and become engulfed in the story anyway. Here you become a school child learning your lessons till you meet a \\"Dog\\" and from there you learn the secret to entering the other world as a necromancer, To meeting beings so powerful that you cannot speak in their presence to finally defeating an enemy so long imprisoned that if he were to escape the world itself suffers.<br /><br />Everything in this book wraps you like a blanket and when your finally done reading you can open your eyes. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fantasy story.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Great Book I really enjoyed it! Depak Chopra is wonderful and has so much wonderful advise and insight.  I recommend this book to anyone looking to improve themselves.

B00ENTDDGW|5.0|After downloading several table hockey games this is hand's down the best one.  I wish you could earn achievements but other than that this game is perfect
B008AUGEFC|5.0|Seriously one of the best pieces of modern literature I have ever read.  The author uses multiple literary styles, time periods and genres to seemingly back himself deep into a compelling, character driven corner before slowly worming his way out like a blacksmith's puzzle, leaving the reader saying \\"How'd he do that?\\"  Amazing.
B00CO4KGYA|3.0|Too repetative boring after just a little while.  I got it free &amp; unistalled it.  I would not pay the $2.99 they are asking for now.

B008JFUO36|5.0|This was a good movie that kept you watching - every scene very beautiful and scary.  The plot was so good.  It developed slowly then evolved into a real surprise by the end.  Would recommend it to those who really love Science Fiction.
B005HSL626|4.0|I love this game so much! but I had to give it 4 stars because of the adds. Halfbrick has got to get rid of them! I love this game, its so much fun. I wanted to give it 5 stars, but because of the adds, I have to deduct 1star. This game is one of my favorites. I totally reccomend it its so much fun!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|One of the best renditions of OZ I have ever seen.  Very colorful and a great back story to the original Wizard of Oz.  James Franco was adorable and fit the character of the Wizard very well.

B0084BMUFA|1.0|Again, this masterpiece points out the need to live a useful life to others.  Those who are of little means shall be awarded kindness and help.  Even in Dickens day were those of means destined to find pleasure in Greed!  Many words in his writings no longer in vogue, but the images of the time come through and bring home a truly wonderful story that teaches man that it is not too late to reverse ill chosen lifestyle.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Fast paced, action packed, and had good character development! Dredd felt a little short, but if there's a sequel then I'll definitely go and see it!

B004PGNB1K|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a lot, and in many cases could not put it down. However there are a few places in the book that drag on a little bit, something, in my opinion, The Name of the Wind never suffered from.<br />Still, a great book and already waiting for the next one!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So love this game.  I like it better than doors for sure. Hope you make more like it. Great job to the creators
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is incredible. It reminds me very much of Margaret Atwood's &#34;Handmaid's Tale,&#34; which is my favorite book so that's high praise indeed from me. I read until my eyes were dry and tired and wished I had the stamina to read more in one sitting. I know this isn't the most insightful review but I wanted the author to know I loved it!

My other daughter has no issue  with her iPod version.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|Sick of hearing young'uns dismiss black/white films &/or no bloody gore - as movies that are lame.  Too bad for you.  Just Rock 'n' Roll w/Freddy in color...  Bela Lugosi is the definitive \\"Dracula\\".  The silent film 1st Dracula was more terrifying, but not the one I grew up with.  The glorious/formal black clothing/mesmerizing back-lit eyes & the cape made him the GQ Dracula.  Bela was the only \\"Dracula\\" w/three beautiful vampire wives.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book. Finished in a day and a half. Awesome couldn't put it down!! Will look for more books from this author.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|First off, the program is very laggy... And this is on a Tegra2 device which is dual core, at 1.5ghz, running ICS. Secondly, I do not like how it takes over the screen when its running. You should be able to minimise it and forget about it until you need it and it should run in the background. Instead, it just takes over. This is very poor design. Also, the EQ band base frequencies chosen make very little sense in the real world. For just one example, most music treble is at around 8Khz not 14Khz (14k Is actually a harmonic frequency not a base frequency. Most cymbals in a drum kit for example are at around 8k). This program is a mess and it really means a redesign for to actually be useful. As it stands now, it just gets in the way. The only way to turn it off is by long clicking a tiny \\"power button\\" in the top right corner which is not very easy to do without bumping and screwing up the settings anyway. What a mess!<br /><br />And then they have the nerve to ask four dollars for this (when it is not a free app of the day)? Oh boy, that's pretty bold.
B00DP8XSQ2|5.0|I LOVE this APP because I can really use this a night to look at planets and constellations through my telescope.I love the spooky music the most!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent series.  Start at the beginning as it plays on into the episodes and one could get lost or confused if part of the story line is missing.  Suspenseful.  Great acting. Great plots.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing this app. Lots of fun and friendly players to trade inventory items with and plenty of players to interact with in rooms.
B001NSLIW2|5.0|I have been listening to Seventh Sojourn for at released in US. I have had in l.p.,cassette, cd and now on kindle. I still listen to the cd in the car. I find it very sensual
B0051ANPZQ|1.0|I personally did not like Wonder. It lacked detail with in descriptions of characters, settings, and emotions. The book was also very predictable. Overall i thought this was a terrible book. I am giving it a one star rating only because a star rating is required.
1781162646|4.0|Brief summary and review, no spoilers.<br /><br />This story is narrated by a man in his sixties as he remembers 1973, the year he was 21 and took a summer job as a \\"carny\\" at the Joyland amusement park in North Carolina. That man is Devin Jones and he has an amazing story to tell about the latter half of that very eventful and pivotal year.<br /><br />Devin is a rather naive and good-hearted guy who's first true love  at college, a girl named Wendy,  is about to dump him. Just prior to the breakup he takes a summer job helping out at an amusement part where he takes on such duties as operating the rides and dressing up as one of the park's mascots - a big dancing dog. He really enjoys his work and befriends many of the old carnies who work there. He also becomes very good friends with a girl named Erin and her soon-to-be boyfriend Tom who also are summer workers at the park and are rooming at the same rental home as he does.<br /><br />Devin is warned by a fortune teller at the park that he has dark times ahead and she tells him that a young girl with a red hat and a boy with a dog will enter his life. And one of them will be psychic.  When Devin finds out that there was a murder at the park years earlier, he becomes interested and he and his friends start to investigate. They also have help from a maybe-ghost and the child psychic.<br /><br />The story reaches a climax during a bad storm at the park when Devin finally confronts the killer (actually a serial killer).<br /><br />I haven't read much King in recent years but the novels I loved in the past all have the same charm and readability as this one. I love the way King interweaves pop songs (from that era) and I think he is a master at dialogue which is not easy. In the past I often thought that King had trouble ending his stories, but not so in this case. I thought the denouement was dramatic and final and felt just right.<br /><br />I also felt that we really got to know and care for the main protagonist in this case and it was enjoyable reading about him and his interactions and experiences even without the killer mystery element. That was just icing on the proverbial cake.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I love cars, I have played many car games but never in a Kindle Fire HD. Now this game and my kindle are perfect to play.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Vampires aren't usually funny, but this was a good family fun-fest. Kids, parents, grandparents - we all enjoyed this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game and its like you are taking care of a real horse! If you are a horse lover then this is a great game for you
B000FA675C|5.0|I love reading about religious history and as much as it got the church's knickers in a twist over parts of it, it fits with the history I've read. Clearly fiction, but well-researched.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Its a very interesting games. I love it and me & my dad play as a team to beat the different levels.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I always have, and probably always will, love this story. Positive message, happy characters, well written, stands the test of time. (It was a best seller in 1914.) What more can one ask for?
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|OH MY GOD GAGA YOUR SO BEAUTIFUL YAAAAASSSS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SONG YAAASSS GAGA FOREVER ALWAYS IN MY HEART YAAAAASSSSS YOU LOOK AMAZING.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|It's an upbeat album that I really enjoy listening to. I like several songs a lot and they make it easy to get up and move.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it -- every single minute!!!  Can't wait to watch season four when it is released in January 2014.  Ciao
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|the movie is really fun. Unsurprisingly, well done with a happy theme. Wreck It Ralph was a favorite of my kids last year.
B00DM12ANO|4.0|I didn't remember seeing anything about this movir before so I purchased it solely on the description. I found it to be an unusual concept but it was very well done. Take a chance - you will like it!
B00947N6UG|4.0|Not the best ever, but fun. It includes some characters we don't normally talk about today. It goes beyond the Easter Bunny and Santa to include the Sandman and others.
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|My daughter and grand daughter borrowed this movie so I decided to let them have the one I had and I ordered another copy.  We all love the movie.
B00506NRBS|5.0|No one shares what they know and what they have learned like Derek Sivers. Why not learn from a genius who has succeeded? This is a handbook on what to do and not to do for anyone starting a new venture or business - online or offline. Derek continues to be the voice of reason and generosity, without self-interest motivations. The more I learn about Derek the more impressed I am with his selfless attitude toward, well - everything!
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|This game is pretty good.  But you almost have to make up your own rules to get it to work.  Certainly for older adults.  The group needs too be fun.  Or the game will sink.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I WOULD EASILY GIVE 5 STARS IF THERE WAS A WAY TO DO A SEARCH IN OUR OWN PINS TO FIND THINGS EASIER :)
B00EPVK5SM|4.0|While not my favorite of their albums, GOTT is well produced and very listenable.  Some of the tracks are a little uneven and overproduced, but there is enough in there that any fan (or first-time listener) will be pleased with the purchase.  I bought it, and I would buy it again (though I'm a pretty staunch fan).<br /><br />...Follow Up:  Went to see their show in DC supporting this album (september 2013).  Fantastic.  The album has really grown on me.  While I still think some of the songs are overproduced, this recording, overall, is right up there among their best.  4.5 - 4.75 Stars.  I strongly recommend it, but give a bit to grown on you.
B001E75QH0|5.0|worked out fine, love it. kids watch it way too much, very happy with how it all worked out. good.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|It gets glichy once in  a while but I like it a lot<br />The people who made this app is smart.thanks for the app
B00BEXB18M|4.0|With every Megadeth album comes those who want another 'Rust in Peace' (likewise with every Metallica album comes those craving something from the first four albums of their catalogue, and everybody from Slayer longs for another 'South of Heaven' or 'Seasons in the Abyss').<br /><br />However, I'm content to let Dave be Dave: he writes above all for himself, and for those who don't like it, to hell with 'em. Thrashers be warned: this is, at best, a *** hard rock *** album. Dave's kicking back and enjoying himself here. Deal with it already.<br /><br />The title track \\"Supercollider\\", both in tone and lyrics, sounds derivative of AC / DC -- yes it's mindless, but for that very same reason, it's a whole lot of fun. (Yes, FUN!). Some of the other tracks follow suite, like \\"Burn\\", \\"Off the Edge\\" and \\"Don't Turn Your Back\\", which in terms of their elementary lyrics of rebellion and alienation, will surely appeal above all to teenage fans (as well as those 30+ year old fans of Megadeth from the 80's who still might have a little teenager in them yet, self included).<br /><br />Other tracks call to mind past releases. \\"Built for War''s guitar style is strongly reminiscent of [[ASIN:B0002EXH40 Youthanasia]] (\\"Train of Consequences\\"), and being the angriest song on the album would make a good entrance theme for a boxing match or football game. 'Dancing in the Rain' would have fit in nicely with [[ASIN:B002C6K7N0 Endgame]], with lyrics that readily capture our time of economic desperation and (post-NSA's 'Big Brother' controversy) political paranoia. \\"Blackest Crow\\" will undoubtedly surprise many with its forays into bluegrass, but actually works and is rather catchy, if somewhat melancholy. And the blistering cover of Thin Lizzy's \\"Cold Sweat\\" is a worthy tribute to the original.<br /><br />On the whole, my recommendation: old-timers, suspend your wish for a sequel to \\"Rust in Peace\\";  Dave honored your request with 2009's thrash masterpiece Endgame, and may yet do so again. In the meantime, those who reward Super Collider with multiple listens just might find themselves singing along.In the meantime, those who reward Super Collider with multiple listens just might find themselves singing along.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I liked this book much more than book 4. It may have been because it focused more on my favorite characters. Don't be mislead by the chapter names. Martin gives some of the regular characters titles for some of the chapters. Can't wait for books 6-7. Guess I'll have to!
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Excellent acting and cinematography with unique storyline.  The two boys were amazing, and McConaughy was exceptional.  Kept you watching and waiting for the next exciting turn.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Fantastic book. 18 more words required to post this silly review... Just read the book! It's worth it! For real
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I love this movie! I have been trying to buy a copy for a long while, but it was always too expensive.  I loved the price and quality of this product and would recommend this company to everyone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good story - very suprised at the ending; not quite what I expected, but that made it more interesting!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read and the movie is even better, Waiting for the sequel to come out on the big screen. Very controversial in the classroom but a great discussion piece.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This is a movie that you should not watch while you are flying. It is extremely intense and a very sorted out plot. I loved it for all that it offered.The acting was superb as well as the story. After seeing this movie I had to go to the airport and looking at the pilots I realized that I was looking at them wondering are the sober, or drunk?<br />I am so sorry. Wonderful wonderful DVD.
1402573723|5.0|This is a great audio book but I highly recommend reading the text first to garner a greater understanding. Powerful and enriching
B007REV4T8|5.0|One of the most beautiful and well sorted James Bond. Unlike the very first one it had everything that a Bond movie requires plus much more.<br />We never get tired of watching it as the intrigue and the acting is so brilliant.
B00181JGI2|5.0|you gotta love Jeff Bridges..he is a man of all men....great movie..love this one..very funny..seen it 5 times already ..great
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|Great movie with a wonderful cast. The plot is great,and the voice of Whitney Houston was phenomenal.Another classic of its time.
B004YCKK6Y|5.0|another great film .lots of twists and turns with a great cast....was very happy finding it from Amazon and a good price
B000FBFML6|5.0|The descriptions are so colorful. I can almost feel, taste, and smell everything Fitz experiences. I love Dutiful and hate the tension in Fitz' relationship with the Fool.
1781162646|3.0|Liked it, and it was very entertaining, although not as suspenseful and thrilling as I thought it would be as in some other crime stories I've read.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I can play on my Android or my Kindle. Also play through Facebook and get free coins, credits, or keys. When I get stuck my new friends can gift me so I complete cities and earn more rewards. The downside is sometimes the game freezes. My Kindle ask me to sign in to Facebook repeatedly but I love to play!
1408842432|3.0|Liked it, a very good read, although it didn't compare, in my opinion, to the author's first book, &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;, which I absolutely loved!!  It did seem to have quite a few of the same elements as &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|A great reminder that we are all connected, and that you attract into your life what you think about most!
0316228583|3.0|I liked it, although I felt it could have had more drama, rather than so much in-depth psychological aspects of the characters.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Involving, mystical, and exciting. One of the best shows I've seen. Makes me curious to learn more about this period of time. I really liked the mysterious aspects of the show, like what happens when they make the pilgrimage
0399159347|5.0|I simply could not put this book down! When I finished it, I found myself somewhat depressed.  I wanted it to go on and on.  I wanted to continue reading about the characters.  Ms. Moriarty has mastered the skill of character development.  The epilogue was the cherry on top.  I am an avid reader and this will be a story I won't soon forget. I highly recommend this book!  I will be reading more of her work in the near future; and the depression at the end of a great novel is worth the joy of a well written story!! Order it now, you will thank me later!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I absolutely love Jace! The book is very well written and the end has a twist to it. I am so excited to read the next book in the series.
B00005JKZ3|1.0|DVD wouldn't play, I live in the US and am irritated amazon would allow garbage to be sold that they know is defective. The description states people outside of the US & canada might have issues, but apparently it's hit or miss so a waste of money.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this series! The second book was just as amazing as the first! I can't wait to start reading the next one.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|One of the BEST films then and still one of the BEST films NOW. Terrific group of actors; the gist of the film is the government officials are a total bunch of idiots and hollywood back in the early 60's and did a GREAT job of in the process. From start to conclusion the film depicts the cold war mentality that we could be destroyed in a moments notice. But in reality, we were much safer then that we are NOW...In fact I would rather be in the 60's than have to deal with all the terrorist crap and government sying on you. Overal GREAT movie...worth the 2 hours.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughter loves this game! Got it as a birthday present.<br />Good price for the app. So far it's entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Truly one of the best games that I've played. Kuddos to those that are responsible for such an entertaining game.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game, I find it very addictive.<br /><br />The dragons are fabulous, they take too long to hatch simply because I'm inpatient
B00992CF6W|1.0|So when I got this I was happy but it got boring after a while. YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH PLAYERS AND THE WORLDS HAVE ENDS!!! I DEMAND A UPDATE!!! APPLE GOT ONE!!!!!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This CD really makes you feel like you are back in a 50's C+W bar. The steel pedal guitar on &#34;Together Again&#34; is riveting.
B00004YMHY|5.0|[[ASIN:B000035P5E Eye of the Needle]]  This is one of my husbands favorite movies....And, rightfully so....A fast paced study of espionage with just the right mix of intrigue and romance...Donald Sutherland is at his best....!<br />I planned to have the \\"movie\\" arrive while I was away ....a little surprise I knew he would enjoy. The envelope arrived...Son Robert stopped in to share the screening..My husband is notoriously inept when it comes to anything remotely technical....no pun........I thought..\\"AHA....a helping hand...\\"  Well,  30 minutes and 6 phone calls later we discovered that the DVD had come from Switzerland.....Impossible to play on our machine....and was in German.....French,..maybe......German, never!..<br /><br />Since my return....I have ordered another version of \\"Eye of the Needle\\", properly formatted, thank God....and also included \\"The Eagle has Landed\\" and \\"The Day of the Jackal\\"......The moment they arrived we popped \\"Needle\\" into the machine....It was just as mesmerizing as we'd remembered.....now, on to the next 2....<br /><br />Just remembered a bi-lingual friend....lately of Germany....she'll love it..!
0399159347|5.0|I went out of what I usually read when I bought this book. I couldn't resist the high reviews, plus the description intrigued me. Am so glad I purchased it. This book is great. I am not yet done but I love it so far! I am very hard to please with books and I love this one. I am looking forward to others from her and I hope they are all as good as this one!
140006922X|5.0|The author writes very well and succinctly covers how, over history,  Jesus has been revered as a very holy man by many different religions.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my kids love this app it is so cool I wish it was a little less laggy though<br />so overall filmed and my kids love it.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Repetitive but still fun. Good graphics and controls. New to tablet first person shooters so still getting the hang of the touch aim.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I watched this movie on my smart dvd player.  Streamed well.  As for the movie itself, it wasn't the best movie that I had ever seen, but not the worst either by far.
B00BZBEL4Y|5.0|Wonderful adaptation of an Austen classic.  I love the attention to detail in regards to Nelson's Navy.  One of my favorite novels beautifully rendered on screen.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really love this device, it's not near Apple TV but for streaming youtube videos fast and portable, it's really worth the price.
B00574PQDU|2.0|I just could't get into it. I like Matt Damon too, but I think this movie started his down turn in his movie career. I really can't think of anything good he has been in since the Bourne movies. Please Don't waste your time or money on this movie.
0143038583|5.0|I looked at food differently after reading. Sparked the notion that everything is connected. Wish I was given this one in middle school.
B004LWZW7O|4.0|I liked the premise of this movie. It was interesting to see how this system of government traded time as a commodity. I thought Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried were convincing in their roles of the &#34;have and have not,&#34; who rebel against the system. Cillian Murphy was great as the cop chasing them. One of my favorite scenes was Justin's standoff with Alex Pettyfer and his gang near the end.
0736083863|5.0|I needed this book. The content provided me insight to the true value of Pilates. I practice Martial Arts and need to be aware of the numerous muscles involved with core movements. Helped me form my own beginner's Pilates routine. Thank you.
B00EOO55GW|3.0|First of all let me say that my favorite A7X album is their self-titled one.  I love a few songs from their older albums and a few from Nightmare.  Dont judge by comments, if you like the band, try it out for yourself.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/22/2013:  After listening further, and reading some lyrics online, I've decided that i do not like this band anymore. They are going further down a path that i do not want to follow anymore...i do not agree with the message they are getting across on some of their songs.
0393317552|5.0|Enjoyed reading a rare recollection of history. Words kept my attention throughout. Thank you for communicating relations between people and technology.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I so much appreciate the new cable!  I would recommend others to purchase a Kindle also.  I enjoy using the Kindle Fire every day.
0452295548|5.0|First recollection of a stroke I heard from one who suffered through. I enjoyed how Jill showed herself; both strengths and weaknesses, as she told her story.
0064471837|5.0|This is a great book, set in a wonderfully detailed universe, which really captures your imagination. An absolute must have for your book case!<br />The world, the society, the characters, the magic. I've never read anything quite like it. This book is unusual and imaginative. Best of all, no matter how many times I have read it, I still get the same excitement as the first time when I begin the series again! I love the characters & I really like the bells too. You can almost hear the melodies being rung when you're deep in to the thick of the plot. Oh, and of course, how can you not enjoy the musings of the mischievous Mogget.
B008469DGY|3.0|I really enjoy playing this. It's a great way to pass the time. My only problems with it is that it drains your battery pretty quick and heats up your phone to a high temp. I use an app to know how hot my phone gets and when I play this, it will get up to 114 degrees. I can actually feel the heat coming off my phone. I have a HTC Rezound.
B00422LESO|5.0|It is a different premise, and I wasn't sure if I would like it- but I did.  The ending was a happy one... And it's not a trilogy :)
0152023984|5.0|Great for children of all ages - and adults too!  So many insights that I think back to time and again.
0671646788|5.0|My son ordered this book and is reading it.  He never pleasure reads and this one is keeping his attention!
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I found this a very fun little time waster with no IAP to ruin any of the action. It's pretty rare nowadays to find anything remotely enticing or engaging without the addition of IAP to help further your progress.<br /><br />This is a very simple hit a ball at the bad guys or objects that will hit bad guys type game, nothing more, nothing less.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I could not believe it. Who knew that Tom Cruise could sing. The movie is great and every time I watch it I still find my mouth staying open. The music is great and I thought Tom Cruise did a great acting job as a Rock Star. This movie will probably be come a cult classic. If you haven't seen it I would encourage you to do so all of the cast were great.
0064471837|5.0|My partner introduced these books to me and I have lost myself between the pages many times stories I can fully immerse myself into again and again I can't wait to introduce these to my children who have inherited our love of reading and hope that they enjoy them as much as me and my partner do
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|as horror films go, this is totally bottom of the barrel.  bad story is exchanged for unnecessarily dark cinematography, and the cheap scares are just cheap.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subwaysurfers is a great game but the outfits are pixleated and that's not cool I sacred up 30 keys for a pixleated outfit not worth it fix it or I'm deleting it and telling people DON'T BUY IT!!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|You will not go wrong with this app. I  my kindle i can't play youtube videos but this app is a breath of fresh air. Excellent viewer and excellent downloader
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the beat game ever you should play it if you did not get it and it is free
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I'm frustrated by the negative reviews of this book. I thought this was an incredibly well-written memoir, honest and open, poignant.  It made me laugh and it made me cry. Piper does not need to apologize for not being a poor black woman from the Projects...as so many seemed to want her to be. She told her story from her own perspective; I didn't find it self-congratulatory, or bragging, or snobby at all. I had no issues keeping up with the characters in the book. Again, this is a memoir folks...don't get irritated that the author is not who you wanted her to be!  I found her introspection later in the book to be humble and revelatory....her admitted lack of concern for the end user of the drugs she was involved with muling money for was prevalent in her attitude early on. She very much realized and was ashamed of that after meeting so many women in Danbury who were drastically affected by addiction.<br /><br />I thought this provided great insight into the federal minimum security prison system, was beautifully written, and most importantly, it entertained me beginning to end. I thought the author really brought home the waste of tax payor dollars incarcerating mostly minority people for non-violent offenses. I agree with her; there are so many other ways to have debts to society paid that would help so many, and would be a better lesson to the convicted, as well as use our tax dollars for far better uses.<br /><br />I would put this book on the top of my must-read non-fiction list!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the intrigue.  Great quality of acting and the real star is the house.  Doesn't get much better that that house!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I thought this book was well written, but I figured out what was going on fast. I enjoyed the characters interaction and I liked the fact that Tess was late to figuring out what Felicity was all about. Made sense that they would be in a strange threesome relationship. I wanted the ending to be different. Like don't back to your stupid husband! LOL I loved Rachael. I could understand her and have empathy and understanding in her choices. If you liked this book, check out A Home for Wayward Husbands, by Johnee Cherry.[[ASIN:B00EO8V53U A Home for Wayward Husbands]] It's a fun read about another bunch of crazy characters with some surprising twists!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It is funny, thought provoking, moving, and heart-wrenchingly  sad, yet hard to put-down. I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  Well done!
0345472322|3.0|the quality of the publication (paper, typesetting) is not great. Book - some pages- is already worning out. Do better.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The set up is easy. Works great. We usually cast youtube, play movies, netflix, google music from smartphone. Press the cast button tv turns on automatically. Hope amazon prime video gets there too, as access to it from the tv is such a pain. We use Tv a lot more now.
B004JHY8A8|4.0|The story opened up a whole section of history I had no idea about. The scary part was the inhalant way humans behave and how it impacts on the planet and society. A beautiful yet very sad story.
0399159347|5.0|This is such a good book! It keeps you interested the whole time and even the ending is a surprise!!!!! I highly recommend. It!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|The book helped me understand cancer, how to see it and cope with living with someone who's had it! I hope to share Anita's story with friends and family and help them change their views and attitude towards cance and more importantly life!
B000005RU2|5.0|My favorite Deep Purple album has just got better with a digital makeover.<br />Having purchased this great doulble live album when first released in the early 70's,stacked away with my other vynyl and unplayed for 25 odd years this new CD sounds as good as ever, brilliant !!!<br />It has stood the test of time very well (41 years ago now!) and in my opinion remains one of rocks greatest (showing my age now!)
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love google search.  It has helped me on more than one osccasion to get an answer within seconds.  Great product!
0345529057|3.0|The combination of small print and thick book, makes it difficult to read without breaking the binding. Great price though.
145210655X|5.0|This book is amazingly insightful, ridiculously cute, and universally entertaining.  My 7 year old loves Darth Vader and this is such a sweet version.  My husband and I wonder if Jeffrey Brown somehow knows our sons because many of the scenes seem inspired by our lives!  I use photocopies of the pages as lunchbox love notes to my 3rd grader and he says his friends ask him for each day's installment!  Thank you, Mr. Brown!
B005HV6Y84|4.0|I saw the movie & theatres & I listened to the songs. It was beautiful, powerful, & fun. I recommend the cd to all of the Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1 fans.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great app. Many sounds and controls to play with and you can use your own music for the alarm too. Better than hotel alarm clocks.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I love the Backstreet Boys so much. It will never stop & this album is so amazing. I recommend this album for all of the Backstreet Boys Fans.  The original cd is 12 tracks on the album. I recommend you to get their album with the 2 bonus tracks on them. The 13th song is called \\"In Your Arms\\" & \\"Take Care.\\"
B00785P2QC|5.0|Nice game to play and create your own city and run it the way you want to and design it
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Just got this game three nights ago and so far is pretty good. Like the tutorials but would like to just play how I want to play at times.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was a wonderful read. I would recommend to read  the book before seeing the movie, if you saw the movie first then that is alright, even though I saw the movie in the middle of me reading the book. Which made me wish that some parts of the book were made into a film but you get what you get I guess. I hope all you other readers enjoy this book a  much as I did.<br />~Love Jas
B007SYWFRM|4.0|love it!!! me and my husband both have a villiage! we are competing to see who has the best villiage!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I Loved loved loved  this series . Couldn't put them down.  I most defiantly would recommend  them to a friend.
B0019IB0II|4.0|It presents a hopeful positive understanding of our brains that can advise medical care, but it could also cause thoughtful discussions in education circles.  Are we providing all the scaffolding needed?
B00D4LTCQ0|5.0|One of my favorites of all time! Love Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah! Watched with my kids! Good family movie even after all these years!
B00846REIS|2.0|The story was too pretentious. Went way too fast.  The story was stupid. The story never went into why the male character was the way he was. The book started to tell about his family and then stopped.  What was wrong with Cross?  Why was he troubled?  We know why Eva was but I kept waiting for the story on Cross.
B0071AKB38|5.0|I usually take my mini x to work and sure makes my day go by fast, battery life is real good and very durable!
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Tried this and liked it very much.one thing I really like is it doesn't need all of your private info.that in itself earns 5 stars as well.hope it does mature wit time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator app. Does what I need it to with a clear interface. I've used other calculator apps but I love this one the best
B00CUIVGZS|5.0|As with all things Chick Corea, I love this album..Just when you thought you heard everything, Chick comes out with new writing, a fresh approach, young, daring musicians and puts together a tightly knit unit of the highest musicianship.<br />Chick Corea turned my life around and I have been in awe and gratitude to him since the 1970's when as a 14yr old kid I discovered Light as a Feather. My life turned around in an instant. I had an epiphany and I have never been the same thanks to the power of this man's music.
1594746036|5.0|I know that since there are almost 2000 reviews of this book, adding my two cents is overkill.  But I just wanted to say that this is one of the most fascinating, original books I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  The book is part-fantasy and part-time-travel and part-artistic wonderment.  It's like a sideshow attraction for intellectuals.<br /><br />I can only echo two things which other reviewers have noted:  Please do yourself a favor and purchase this book in hardcover.  The photographs and letters are an integral part of the story and will be best seen in the hardback version.  And please put your order in now for this wonderful author's sequel, due early in 2014.  I can't wait.<br /><br />Recommended without reservation.
B00E10X7A0|2.0|This movie was shipped to me in a paper envelope, (not a proper case as advertised) and was very clearly a downloaded<br />disc with a paper label on it.  It played well, however, I am morally against buying &#34;bootleg&#34; movies and that is exactly what this appears to be.  I am greatly disappointed with this seller for this reason and will not purchase from him in the future.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is a grand story of many dimensions and fascinating characters.  So often, an author has a fine idea;  yet, has not the gift with words to birth the vision.  Anthony Ryan does.  I felt grief when Blood Song was ended.  Waiting for the next book is difficult; but, well worth the discomfort.  If you have been searching for another great fantasy epic, I think you have found it in A Raven's Shadow.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|This is the second one of these I bought.  I have an earlier version that was only 280 lumens instead of 300.  I love the old one.  I've used it quite a bit.  I'm guessing probably 60+ hours plus on the same set of batteries and it's still bright.  So I expect I'll love this one all the more, but I've only turned it on inside the house. They're solid construction, compact, and bright.  I have some AA to D conversion cartridges so my rechargeable NaMH AA's work in it just as well except they obviously won't last quite as long.
B004SDSSFY|2.0|I have Docs to Go on my iphone, and it does what I need it do beautifully, so when I got a kindle fire, I bought the same app. I don't know if this is an issue with the android version, or a problem with the kindle, but.... I use google docs almost exclusively for my spreadsheets and word processing files. The app will not open my existing word processing files, and if I create a new google word doc, it saves it, and then is unable to open it again. I can go to google docs on the web or my iphone and open my files with no trouble, so it is not an issue with the files.
B00BKRON5K|3.0|Cordain's book about the paleo diet is a good book which contains the basics about the paleo diet. So if you don't know anything about the paleo diet (or lifestyle) could this book be a very good start for you. Instead, if you already are familiar with the basics of the paleo diet, brings this book nothing new to you. All the information related to diet and exercise in the book is really on a basic level and that's why I didn't benefit that much from the book. In addition, there are quite many pages but also a lot of repetition which raises a question, could all the information be expressed more compact to make it easier to understand? A special comment about the ebook which I had. This ebook version has not been edited well. It was quite often when a few lines was missing on a page break.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this book if you don't know anything about the paleo diet, but otherwise this book is not worth reading and you should choose a more advanced book about the paleo diet.
0984334904|5.0|Solid and glossy card stock. Precut holes for use on supplied metal ring. Easy to see and clever design. Very helpful to my 7th grade son who wanted to brush up on his vocabulary prior to year two of Japanese language class. Highly recommend.
B0052REUW0|2.0|The liberal overtones made an otherwise interesting book such an annoyance I'm sorry I wasted my time and money. A usual example of progressive, liberal tunnel vision, and duplicity.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Awesome book!  Brandon Sanderson develops deep and great characters that become familiar friends, and builds a wonderful, unique, adventure around them.  Mistborn is a very original, great story.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Installing on my bicycle took just minutes. The bracket is not coated so I cut a strip of black Gorilla duct tape and used it as padding (not necessary.) I angled it so the ball was below the bars so that the finished mount would not be up as high as it would be if I mounted it as shown in the picture of the product. High quality materials, good design make me feel very comfortable that the phone will be well cared for. (Bought for use with the short arm and X-Grip)
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I don't have a kindle HD just a kindle fire so I don't know where this is either, because no app that I can find on my kindle fire for this
B002FQOI0A|5.0|Really suspenseful, with bits of laugh out loud humor. I was surprised by the different characters in the story and how they all tied together.  I love the lessons of life and the mystery that is continuously present that makes it so difficult to stop reading it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Max Brooks does a great job of telling the story of a zombie apocalypse from different perspectives! The details are well done to the point that I kept wondering to myself \\"Could I survive a zombie attack?!?!\\" This is actually the second time that I've read the book,  after having seen the film a couple months ago. I see some of the ideas in the movie but it is not a replication by any stretch of the imagination. I was not disappointed that the movie and book are very different.
B00BEYYO8U|5.0|This movie was packed with action, adventure and even humor. Plus a well written great plot with wonderful acting. Nicely done.
B005WQ4RP6|1.0|Movie stopped. Could not watch end of movie. This has happened with last two movies purchased. Need to fix especially when it is a paid for movie.
0064471837|5.0|Just a few nights ago, I had a dream that there was a pill you could take that would allow you to forget you had read any book of your choosing, so that you could have the pleasure of reading it for the first time all over again. The pill could only be used three times, but one pill would work for an entire series. In my dream, and after I woke up, I knew for certain that the first series I would choose to be able to read again for the first time was the Abhorsen series.<br /><br />I love these books, and Sabriel is my favorite of the series. I have given this series to so many people that I've started keeping an extra box set at home, just so I can give it away if I meet somebody worthy who hasn't read it yet. Buy Sabriel now, or better yet, buy the entire series in the box set, because after you finish Sabriel you won't want to wait to read Lirael and Abhorsen. I can't wait for Clariel!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitare the way I remember playing with real cards.  Moves nicely and easy to use.  Play it every night !
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|This show kept you on the edge of your seat. I know quite a few shows I liked that did not last long on tv. The man who never was, Other World and others.
B00EP2PXCY|4.0|I was a complete doubter at first. I'm a HUGE fan of Mariah Carey, and when I heard Ariana Grande's cover of \\"Emotions\\" I began to think that she was just another studio artist. I was hesistant to buy this album at first, but I'm REALLY glad I did! Her voice is AMAZING and this album gives you a 90s R&B feeling! I only wish she had more ballads, but other than that, I am in LOVE with this album!
0525953728|5.0|This book was insanely intense.  The details of the entire operation made you feel like you were right with the troops invading the Bin Ladden's compound.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|I am a fan of Inside Man and this movie is in that category. It is fun to watch and you have to pay attention. There are clues throughout the movie. It teaches you to pay attention. I watched this movie the night I got and enjoyed it so much I watched the next morning to see what the hell I missed. Fun movie.
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|Gillian Flynn knows how to write and produce a story so thrilling, gripping and disturbing that you just can't let go.  I find her books like a drug, the more you read, the more you are drawn in and become addicted to the story that you just can't stop reading.  This is my third book by this author, having already read Gone Girl and Sharp Objects, I was looking forward to this read.  It did not disappiont and was another quality twisted and disturbed story of a family that suffers an endless stream of unfortunate events.  My only criticism would be the ending, I felt wasn't quite as strong as her other two, but overall it was a fantastic read and I can't wait for the next book release.
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|If you are a fan of Rod this a must. It is fun to listen to. You get to hear songs such as Maggie Mae as he is working on it. It is more of an improve cd but as must to listen to and once you do you will buy it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show has it all!  You get a little of everything...  Harvey and Mike are an awesome duo.  Love the suspense, and the little bit of romance...
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Product arrived as expected, and in excellent condition.  I prefer iTunes digital copies for my apple devices, so was very happy to see that option.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|After enjoying Christoph Fischers first book 'The Luck of the Weissensteiners' i found his next book on line and immediately downloaded 'Sebastian' too. The way both books are written are fantastic, captivating and definate page turners. Good research is the basis and then the characters coming to life. I felt for the Main character overcoming his disability. His struggles with confidence and determination in daily life. The backdrop of the period was interesting and with some very interesting supporting characters.<br />Another great book and i will look forward to the 3rd.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Product arrived as expected, and in excellent condition.  I prefer iTunes digital copies for my apple devices, so was very happy to see that option.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|I read this book on the recommendation of a friend as i like historical fiction. I didn't know much about this side of the war but certainly learned a lot from it. The central characters were really likable and i found i cared what happened to them. It has clearly been researched well and the way it was written made it easy and enjoyable to read. I could vision the places talked about and the situations they were going through.<br />A great read that i will be recommending on to many.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Asking me to buy Pro if I wanted to download video. I got a different APP that I can actually watch videos without having to purchase.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|It's awesome. Play it. It's super fun, and challenging. Seriously, you should get this game. Play it. Just do it now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and exciting to play on your tablet or phone. It cures the boredsome hours of the day and fulfills you with a major jump start on a challenging game play.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|really enjoying season 5 so far - I enjoy the chemistry between the stars and the acting is great - highly recommend
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is a stress reliever I love it it's fun simple and easy I am on level 9 so far and moving on enjoy the game everyone.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love how easy it is to play and I really like that the designs on the tiles are so clear and I don't have to squint my eyes to tell what is on them!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Nice keyboard... Like the direction arrows. Also like how the numeric keyboard is laid out when it is brought up. Love SwiftKey.
0452295548|5.0|This book should be read by anyone who has a family member or friend who has had a stroke.  We found it very helpful.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I refer to JD's books and videos. His knowledge and techniques are essential for anyone interested in knot tying crafts.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Make sure you get the appropriate power pack with your 802 for your country's power supply! If in Sydney, I suggest checking out Store DJ on Parramatta Rd, Stanmore
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't know how this is going to be made into a movie with all the SEX and the storyline about the Dominant and the Subservant.  It will probably be eluded to, but won't be as good as the book.
B007HACDLK|5.0|again, following the adventures of Mitch Rapp is really nice, Vince Flynn is able to write books that you would not stop reading once you start
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I think John Green created brilliant characters that anyone can enjoy. I would recommend this book to everyone!
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Interesting and engaging from the very first moment. I couldn't stop reading once I'd started. I love all books by Zafon and this is no exeption!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|We never have an alarm clock when we travel.  It's great for that and also for getting the weather for the day.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have just played the game for a little while, but it has been very stimulating. And fun all hidden object gamers will love this game
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|very good movie, the special effects were amazing, all star cast for this movie and they had an excellent performance
B005TBWN0K|3.0|It's only ok. There is no eraser tool that i can find and i cant find any way to get help.not very easy to figure out. It could be good if they put some effort into it.<br /><br />Nice you can save to evernote though.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|This was a fun return to the land of Star Wars. Some cheesy scenes brought down the overall experience.  Character development was somewhat absent.
B008966SLM|5.0|Another stellar CD from Robert Cray.  I enjoy all kinds of music and still enjoy the \\"album\\" as a whole, instead of individual songs or downloads.  Robert Cray is perfect just to put all his albums in a playlist, hit shuffle, and lay back.  This album is masterful.  The guy has never done a bad album, and this one is among the best.  Saw him again last year at the Horseshoe.  What a show.  Pick up this CD and you will not be disappointed.  For certain.
B005R4PGQM|5.0|This is what two decades in the music industry will produce - pure brilliance.<br /><br />I lost touch with Darren Hayes' music since \\"Tension and the Spark\\", not really connecting with the songs he's released since then.  But this album has returned to the sound I love.  Electronic pop with some magnificent orchestral accompaniment, deep lyrics and catchy tunes.  And of course, that voice... as thrilling as ever, hitting impossible notes.  My favourites right now are \\"Talk Talk Talk\\", \\"Bloodstained Heart\\", \\"God walking into the room\\" and \\"Explode\\".<br />Well worth paying a bit extra for the Deluxe Version.<br /><br />Also, so far every song has impressed me - an unusual feat. Usually most albums scatter a few good tunes amongst fillers.  This one is full of awesome.  All the songs and videos are available to listen in full on Youtube - have a listen and come buy this album when you realise how good it is.
B00EQNYOYU|5.0|New interesting sound. Love it still has the disturbing and ( pardon the pun) haunting sound. Much more electronic based than past albums.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very emtretiment  and my song love it , I will recommend . fun and I promes you will an joyed
B008Y7D4FY|5.0|Love the movie. It is really scary. It scares the daylights out of my kids too. Can't wait to watch part 2.
0064471837|5.0|Where to start? I first picked up Sabriel at my school's library when I was in 5th grade. The cover by Leo and Diane Dillon interested me and the story on the flap intrigued me even further. And when I read it...whoa. My life changed forever.<br /><br />I'd read a few fantasy books before Sabriel. But non have impact me so much. Now 15 years later, I still go back every once in a while to this trilogy and re-read them - Sabriel, more than the other two. Some people re-read Harry Potter. I re-read The Old Kingdom Chronicles. You see, Sabriel was a heroine to me. And I love the world that Garth Nix created.<br /><br />The world of the dead, where there are hidden princes and dark magic. Where a young girl goes back to her homeland to find her father, only to discover far more than she had ever dreamed. This has it all for me, and it opened up a whole world of fantasy to me.<br /><br />I love it. I always will. I hope you will too.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I really have enjoyed this app even though I got the app for my 4 yr old.  We're at level 24 now and it takes really too long to get to the next level now.  We have gotten by without buying too many extra pearls.  What I'm finding very annoying now is that since we have most of the rare plants already, we no longer ever get a rare plant from the mystery seed.  I think we've planted more than 40 of them and haven't gotten a rare.  I'd give up but we need one for a quest.  Even the rare plants that you buy for 10 pearls have gotten frustrating... it seems we almost always get the same one now.  Is this to force us to spend the 45 pearls to get exciting rares?  Because that is not happening.  Anyway, this is a nice app but after a certain point you just have to like the idea of decorating and designing your reef more than collecting the rare plants, unless you're ok with shelling out the bucks.  Haven't had any technical issues like some others have reported.  Using a samsung galaxy 2 tablet.
052118939X|5.0|Very good content! Top quality! Really usefull. I enjoyed it deeply. Very good CD-ROM also, helps with listening skills and pronunciation.
B0084I2PEO|5.0|I didn't think it could be as good as The Kite Runner, but it was an excellent story.<br />The last paragraph was as good an ending of a story as I have ever read.<br />I waited a couple of years after the Kite Runner came out because I didn't think a book<br />about Afghanistan could be that interesting, but I was wrong about that. And I wondered if<br />another story set there would be of interest, but once again this author is a great story teller.<br />Two of the best books I have ever read!
B0006AAS5G|5.0|An awesome watch. Looks much nicer in person, the picture does not do it justice. I did have to get it resized, it was to lengths too big, but that only costs me 4 dollars at my local jeweler, so no biggy, watches usually come big anyway. The price is another thing you can't beat, it definitely looks like a 350.00 watch, and paying 80 is just awesome.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|This book is a must read for all curly hair people ;)  it changed my hair and the time I spend on it.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|It was different than the BBC version, and started out slowly, but the characters really went from simply mean self-serving to being very Machiavellian after a few episodes.  I was left hanging at episode 13 and can't wait until next season.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|The part that I keep in mind that I read was the first (or maybe second) experiment where you had to choose something to look for. I think that I chose purple birds.  I couldn't believe how many I saw, pictures or otherwise!  It's just a good reminder to keep your desires, goals, dreams in the forefront of your thinking.  You'll never see it if you aren't looking.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I'm not usually a hidden object game fan, but this game is great! The creepy music and random voices made me turn on the lights to play it. I love games like that! It sucks you in and really makes you feel like you are there, playing it for real. Great game!
B00BESM14U|4.0|Cute indie film with a strong ending and some slightly weaker points. But worth a watch. Rent it on Amazon.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|It was an amazing movie ,kept me on the edge of my seat.im still not sure what happened at the end. I plan on watching it again.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|This movie sucked. If you liked this movie, you should be moved into special ed. Because it will rot your brain and ruin your life.
0671449028|4.0|A friend of mine has had difficulty getting her 3 year old to sleep in his own  bed.  This has been helpful with this situation.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I love Sara's music, she is just geniuos. I'm very happy with my disc. I have it since two days ago and I've eard it over and over again.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I have bought the Baraka movie a few years ago, and I was really surprised to see a new Ron Fricke movie came out! The picture quality and audio quality is superb! The product came sealed and in excellent conditions! I recommend this seller to all!
B003LYJUXU|5.0|Everything I expected and more. The discs has all the music I love and made good to my teenager's days. I love it!
B00CE2G3AS|5.0|It's a surprise to see this excellent musical movie came to Blu-ray format! I didn't receive yet at my home, and I'm waiting anxiously to put my hand in this Blu-ray! As I trust this seller, will be giving the highest score for its excellent services! Very recommended!
B0001XPZGA|3.0|The music is great was sadly, the vinyl has two scratches and the firsts song of both sides doesn't sound good. In the first moment I tought it was my equipment fault but I made it check and it's fine. The problem is with de vinyl. Now is too late to change it so there is nothing I can do :(
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I received this product at my home, and came In a beautiful slip cover, and the product came all sealed inside! It's an excellent seller from marketplace, I recommend hist product and this excellent movie to all!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so awesome the horses look so real there are also so many games that are on this app
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|It's very good to see a classic like Ghostbusters to be the firs of the Sony's series of mastered in 4k on Blu-ray format! I didn't received this product yet, but I'm anxiously waiting to watch the final result of this mastered in 4k transfer on my TV! I recommend this seller for his excellent products and services!
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|One of the best movies, never seen a movie like it.  Must See for people who love movies but tired of the same old thing.  More than just magic
B009IQG5LK|5.0|I'm a fan of this excellent Dick Tracy adaptation from Warren Beatty, because of his HQ looks, and his beautiful costumes and colors used! The product came in time at my home, and for my surprise I received in a beatiful slip case, and the Blu-ray came all sealed! I recommend this seller and his excellent products to all!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|If you are looking for a new keyboard,  this is the one.  My mistake have decreased like 50 percent since switching to this keyboard app.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|For my first buy with this seller, I gave him the maximum score for his product that came sealed, and in a good packaged. My only surprise is that the product didn't came with the holographic slip cover, that came with this Blu-ray version... it's a shame! But I recommend this seller to all!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|And I love love love this book!  You have to read all four previous books thought to get it all.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I think this book is a good one for teens, it will hopefully get them thinking about the way they interact with each other. My only concern/criticism would be that I felt like there wasn't enough said about how to get help.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Great love story, typical &#34;NS&#34;;  thought the recurring vision of the guy he accidentally ran over was a bit far fetched however, NOT typical &#34;NS&#34;!
B007THA4FI|2.0|Characters were not developed enough to really feel involved in the plot or care what happened to whom.  I had a hard time finishing it.  I always try to finish and find a redeeming grace, but found none this time.
B000051VWW|5.0|Arrived better condition than expected in original packaging. Plays perfectly<br />Well worth the price and I would recommend to friends.
074322454X|3.0|I have  not srtarted reading yet but if its like the serise then i will have no complaints but looking at it goes back more than the series did ascit mentions the camp were they were before comeing to england so fingers crossed money well spent thank you  paul hassall
B000001FYZ|4.0|Arrived better condition than expected in original packaging. Plays perfectly<br />Well worth the price and I would recommend to friends.<br />Sounds just like I remeber and I would purchase again.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Great game, its the best free fps I have found. I world definantly recommend this to anybody who likes a good fps.
B005UKK4Y2|3.0|The movie was okay. I expected it to be better. It wasn't has funny has I anticipated. Hopefully the second one will be funnier.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Though this will never teach me to play a real piano because of the size of my kindle, i will learn the keys. It works wonderfully and if my kindle were the length of a keyboard or piano there wouldn't have been a difference,. I love it, a perfect way to spend free time on a rainy day.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|This has become one of my favorite movies. Its super funny and the interaction between the characters is great. I highly recommend this movie.
0091929784|5.0|This book has been very aptly named. It discusses several issues that most business owners face. The business tips have been compiled in such a manner that you find it easy to understand and follow them in your business to \\"Rework\\" your strategy.<br /><br />Its free of any kind of redundant or useless information. There are no big management theories but simple useful advice delivered very efficiently. It has helped me clear several myths about business operations, marketing, hiring, communication etc. If you are starting new or still flexible in your business practices than this book can really help you.<br /><br />Thanks for this great book!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game was fun to play and had a very interesting story line.  I really enjoyed exploring the island and solving the puzzles.  There is an in game &#34;quest helper&#34; that will tell you where to go if you get stuck or can't seem to solve a puzzle.  It was also easy to navigate.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best I have ever played, I could play this game all day, I highly recommend this game to all gamers. Five star rate.
B00DB97LCM|3.0|My review in on these reviews. Anyone who reads them will now understand why most Star Trek fans are grown men who either live with their mothers or sleep on their couches.
B008ZDC7M8|2.0|Just started watching this series on TCM. Don't think I'll make it past the first episode. Unfortunately the filmmaker's ego and some mistakes get in the way of this being a fine history or analysis of filmmaking.....it really had potential!<br /><br />Maybe the documentary is trying to continue the age-old discussion of filmmaking as \\"art\\" vs \\"commercial product\\". In the first ten minutes we are told that \\"Casablanca\\" is not a \\"classic film\\", but a more obscure Japanese film is. As a long time fan of Japanese cinema, I'm intrigued by the argument.... I keep watching. The episode then goes on to talk about other films including \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\", completely confusing characters and the story of the film. Has anyone who worked on this documentary seen the film?<br /><br />I found Mark Cousins' narration to be informative but his condescending tone is really annoying. Also, he seems unwilling to stop his continuous narrative diatribe on film for a moment and let the film clips play on their own merits. I can't image watching 15 hours of this......<br /><br />The documentary is obviously made by a film lover, but someone who mostly concerned with pushing his opinion of cinema. He also seems unfamiliar with some of the movies he is giving his opinion on. You can read other reviewers here and see the many complaints about the tone and accuracy of this documentary.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese succeeded much better with a personal history of film in 1995 with \\"A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through American Movies\\". See it for a great personal perspective on cinema by a filmmaker, not a critic.<br /><br />My degree is in cinema studies but I think I would have dropped this class.<br /><br />Too bad.....seems like a great compilation of footage.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another great book by James Rollins. His ability to blend science, adventure and suspense into one is a true gift. Cant wait for the next chapter...
B009AY04A8|3.0|Unfortunately the first hidden objects game I played was Magic Academy II and it was well worth the time with a variety of games including hidden panels and sequenced puzzles.  This was an OK hidden objects game and as others have reviewed, after turning off the timer and quickly kicking through the dialog I enjoyed finding the objects and since I got the games as a FAotD it was worth  the price, but would have enjoyed more variety. Nevosoft, make more games like MA II.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I agree that most of the negative reviews are accurate, but still...It's a good read. Worth the investment in time and money.
B000W965QW|5.0|I love how Nick Hornby writes. Very entertaining!! I enjoyed every word and I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.
B005HS00NW|5.0|It came in the mail rather quickly, it's in great quality, some of my all time favorite songs are on there; though, some of the songs are a bit odd, but its M83! What do you expect! Haha I highly recommend this product!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Way cool<br />Way cool thanks for the game<br />To fun it is a great game everyone should try it out fun fun
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Good formula writing. Much violence!!<br />The Michael Chilikis story w two flunkies. Watched too much at one time. This made the two flunkies semm like dumb & dumber. Turned this show into a comedy. Probably my medication
B0089XH38M|5.0|I use AVG on my android phone and desktop and now on the Kindle.  Never had any issues or virus problems.
0061564893|4.0|Excellent story. Very thought provoking and appears to be well researched. This should change the discussion on exploration. Can't wait to read 1434!
B00BE97ONM|5.0|Son of a serial killer had me from the first page. This is a story with strong characters, including a man losing his mind, a detective looking for revenge on the killer who took the life of a loved one, a greedy girlfriend, back-stabbing friends - everything you could want in a psychological thriller is in this book. A brilliant piece of art.
B009HXGD4S|4.0|It was a querky but good movies. The actors were at the top of their game and the story line moved quickly.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Fast paced, no part of the book lags. It barrels along at breakneck speed! It is so easily visualized! It's hard to believe the movie will live up to the 'mental movie' reading this book gave me!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|It kept me awake but I thought it lacked any real action. I like both Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman but was slightly disappointed because the talent of these actors could have made this film much better.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|This book made me think, first of all. Lots of consequences to what the characters had done were missing, so I had to use my imagination to visualize what happens. The book is also fast-paced, and the ending is unpredictable.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My 3 year old loved this movie. Especially since he is really into monsters and zombies right now. This is a great buy!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Personally, I LOVE THIS WEBSITE AND THEN I FOUND OUT IT HAS ITS OWN APP!!!!!! It has so many things to look at. Perfect for everyone!
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|First game with no rhyme or reason and somehow I am actually winning and not sure how that is possible. Good thing it is free and I have not spent a dime to keep playing so I will right up to the point when they ask for money and then it will be deleted.
B004X80QNG|5.0|This is quite a useful app. It is like a digital day planner and more. It's easy to use and has so many helpful things to help keep appointments, birthdays and all organized. You'll have no excuses for missing dates, times, addresses, anniversaries etc. ever again!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a great book.  Well written, descriptive, thought-provoking.  I am reading it with my fifth graders and having some poignant discussions! Everyone could read and get something out of it.  Well done!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I gave it a four stars rating for the most part of being a good read , and it kept me wanting to read more.  I like that I could get a understanding of Hazel & Gus. You ended up caring for these two middle aged teenagers, that were given a not so sold poker hand in life, but they sure made it a very interesting hand to play.<br /> I would have maybe given it a five star if I didn't have to reread fifteen pages to grasp what just happened or who said that, or what the heck word was just used.<br />I would recommend this books to friends, yes. I would tell them it's not a full up in your face love story. I would say it is a great story of two you people trying to make cancer not the center of life but, love dealing with cancer and fighting it.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Every character on the show adds something to the story. I can't wait for the new season to start. This is a must see
0066620996|5.0|Wonderful ideas in this book no matter what type of organization one works in, whether non-profit, for-profit, or public. Data somewhat what dated but the lessons learned still valuable.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel was recommended to me on a whim by my girlfriend, and it was truly one of the best blind readings I have ever had. The novel follows young Sabriel, the daughter of a necromancer whose job is to undo the evils of other necromancers, and a collection of companions and creatures that she meets along her path to seal an ancient evil from the past. Wildly inventive, dark without being TOO dark, expertly written, with an incredibly deep and engrossing world that tells you just enough to make sense but little enough to keep a sense of mystery and arcane secrets. Sabriel is a great read for any fantasy fans over the age of 14 or so- not for the younger set. Also worth noting this is the first book in a trilogy, each one of which is just as good!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app!!!! First horse app that I found that doesn't lag or have bad graphics. I have really enjoy it and its simples to use.
B000ID37RM|5.0|A classic book, a classic movie.<br />Do you vote by the law or by the culture?<br />I find it upsetting every time I see it.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I did mot know these type of apps existed but once I saw it as faotd decided to give it a go. I must say that it works great both on my Samsung Galaxy S2 and Kindle Fire first generation.  The app has two sides of controls allowing you to adjust everything. Easy to close app as well when needed. Great work.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I enjoy their first album, and I think this one is another great listen. I don't feel the need to skip over any song, the whole album is good.
B001HBWY8M|5.0|Love it I've watched it over and over again its one of my favorites . I have it on phone and iPad to watch wherever I go.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|what more can i say, its Twitter!!!!! great app to have! use it every day to follow others and have others follow me!
1441761268|5.0|Bought the book on CD and didn't want to stop driving!  Had to buy the book to finish it! Great<br />read
B008469DGY|5.0|This is the best golf game I have ever played! I don't like golf but this game makes it really fun. The graphics are awesome. Just do not go in the water because you lose a lot of points, but that makes it even more fun. Love this game!
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Watched with my family. We all enjoyed! While you can say its magic, some of it was a little unrealistic!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Love the colour very intense blue, and my favorite things are the nice melodies you can choose from to set as an alarm tone.
B009POHHRG|5.0|Typical Alan Moore ... leaves you disturbed and thinking! So many of the Joker's arguments ring true ... maybe all it really takes is one bad day ...
B0019NB9A2|5.0|Great to see this movie in Blu-ray and on big screen TV. Good special effects for the time this movie was made.
B005R32L66|5.0|Quick and easy with no problem to download, ran first time perfectly.  Great app for my LG phone.  I recommend this service.
1423101502|5.0|Author: Rick Riordan<br />Publisher: Hyperion Books/Penguin Books<br /><br />Percy Jackson and the Last Olympian by Rick Riordan is an extremely enthralling book that you will never want to put down. The whole series is great, and is also an interesting way to learn about Greek Mythology, whilst reading about Percy, the main character and also a Demigod, and his adventures. Rick manages to bring the Mythology to life throughout this whole series, whether it be when the Demigods are at Camp Half-Blood or the Olympians are fighting Typhon, the Father of All Monsters. I assure you there is not one scene in this book that will not leave you wanting to continue reading. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Mythology or wanting a book that will always keep them on the edge of their seat.<br /><br />Rick Riordan has written the whole series from Percy's perspective, and I find that really helps you gain a better connection with each of the characters. Whatever Percy feels about a certain character, you tend to feel the same way, as it is written in first person. The advantage of writing this series in the first person is that it makes the reader feel like they are actually there, doing what Percy is doing, whether they are fighting the Drakon or finding out what the Great Prophecy is. I think that finally discovering what the Great Prophecy says in the last book of the series helps build suspense  throughout the series because you sit there wondering \\"What is the Great Prophecy?\\" \\"What will the Prophecy say?\\" \\"Will the Prophecy mean something bad for Percy?\\" or \\"I wish I knew what the Great Prophecy is\\".<br /><br />The storyline of The Last Olympian is similar to the other books in the series; however, this is the final stand between Percy and Luke, who has been turned into Kronos. The Demigods must save Camp Half-Blood and Mount Olympus, before the Olympians fall and the Titans rise to rule the world. The last battle between the Demigods and the Titans takes place in New York. Morpheus, the God of Dreams, has put the city under a spell so the mortals are not aware of what is going on. The suspense of whether the Demigods win or are defeated by the Titans makes you anxious, and you never want to stop reading until you reach the last page.<br /><br />Percy Jackson and the Last Olympian is one of the best books I have ever read. At first, I was hesitant to read the series; however, as soon as I read Percy Jackson and the Lighting Thief, I had to continue reading the whole series. Percy Jackson and the Last Olympian is truly an incredible book and I look forward to begin reading the second series, The Heroes of Olympus.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like that there are different modes and puzzles and that the amount of items you have to find per scene increase. The game is playable without having to spend money it just requires more time.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|worst tom cruise film ever. If I was in theatre I would have asked for my money back. Only good part was special effects and sound
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I got this about a week ago, have used it several times for practical purposes, and it works amazingly well.  Sometimes it confuses my handwriting, but with a little practice, it has gotten better.  To me, it is much more intuitive than a standard calculator with buttons.  If you are taking advanced classes, it probably won&acute;t meet your needs, but works great for everyday uses.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Although not much in this book was new to me, the experiments made the messages harder to ignore. Coincidentally, (lol) I recently came to the conclusion that nothing changes no matter how much I work out because my belief is that, you guessed it, nothing changes no matter how much I work out! Now when I go to the gym, I visualize my muscles getting stronger and my body looking more toned. Imagine my surprise when I read that here a few days later.
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|Enjoyable low fantasy. But can't the characters swear in a more period and culture appropriate manner? The very modern swearing and slang detracts from my enjoyment... Author has more than enough talent, so must just be careless, and the editors lazy. Too bad.
B009RWRIKM|2.0|I saw this film in a theatre and was amazed, amazed. I wanted to go back in time to Germany to see Pina's stuff live. I quickly ordered a CD of the music from the film, only to find that, due to this and that legal permission lacking, they could not sell me the music from the film, but something similar. Next, I bought the double DVD of the film; maybe.  It's been over a year since I saw the film, but my memory says that this is not the same film that I saw in the theatre. The theatre version had whole, or nearly whole, dances; the DVD seems to be a lot of fragments. I fear that maybe the same legal restriction that applied to the music prevents them from selling the film as seen in the theatre. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but my thought is that you will pay a top price and not get the film nor the music that you saw in the theatre.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A Winter's Tale seen through the eyes of The Long Walk; lonely, angry, and oddly exciting.  A fantastic dystopian future, the words have stayed with me each time I set it down to sleep.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|I enjoy Nathan Fillion on Castle, & everyone reviewed Firefly 5 stars, so I gave it a try. Sorry, wasn't for me. It seems to be a series that you either love it or don't like it.  It was okay but nothing I would go out of my way to watch again. My sister didn't like it but her husband LOVES it (I never agree with his taste in movies or TV shows anyway), and a friend of mine LOVES it.  I gave it away.<br /><br />They've made several \\"inside jokes\\" on Castle in reference to Firefly, so now that I've watched the show I understand the inside jokes.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I just read the commerical summary, above these reviews, on the 'sell'-page-<br />It seems to imply that Cranston is reinvigorated, now that he is Stage 4,terminal cancer. And that his focus on making money, to leave his dear family, is a /fun way-to-go.<br />Not even close. Then there are the reviewers who copy this summary and get top ratings for telling a lot of backdrop.<br />Hey, by now, you probably know this is a gripping/brutal drama- about a drug that usually ruins lives. And the people who are in this so-called business, are putting their necks next to a commonly used chopping-board.<br />If you really prefer the more realistic stories, you just may get pulled into this. If I knew the juist of the story, I might have turned away. It would not sell very well with a quick synopsis. But I had AMC on cable, was kind of  curious, there was hype..and blammo. Hooked. I tried to make strangers check it out. Partly because a lot of people have cable, often only for their kids. Few people paid attention to AMC..old movies. Its on the map now..oh yeah. And not cool for young kids- /block this.<br />And, by the way, Breaking Bad is not to be compared to Sopranos, no way. That series was more about killing- AND eating, without a need to wash hands first. Not that impressive, but most of the characters were entertaining when not mashing brain0s out.<br />This is a truly unique series. I thought there would be some kind of outrage about this, its that tough. So realistic,AND tough. I did not expect an award-winning success here. The public, wow, how sophisticated the audience has become. The critics did not condemn it either.<br />You may just find, that you also, just have to keep watching..and maybe even go back in a year..to see the whole story open up again.<br />Maybe try an episode..or season one..I wont get a commission, and my reviews are not making me a 'top contributor' either! But this is worth commenting on.  Great / gripping drama.
B0038P59A0|4.0|My sister and husband hated it (but then I don't like any of the movies he does) and a friend of mine loved it.  I thought it was pretty good.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Having seen Avatar previously, I found the movie to be a bit long.  Most of the special effects were grandios!!!  I would purchase Avatar again even if I had not seen it before.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|the &#34;1-star rating&#34; is simply for the reason that we haven't been able to watch the whole movie without a few hiccups in the &#34;streaming.&#34;  no, it's not our connection speed because i can stop the movie in question & watch another movie without any problems or hiccups in streaming.  the movie stops & rebuffers every 1 minutes & 13 seconds.  this makes it very annoying & unappealing to watch.  i'm sure they'll(AMAZON) resolve the issue at some point;  it seems like it would be a really cool movie.  i've tried several scenarios to get the movie to play all the way through to no avail.  i've tried fast forwarding it all the way to the end & then rewinding the movie but that didn't solve the problem as it still stalled & made the movie unwatchable.  AMAZON's customer service is top-notch so if you have any hitches with your purchase they'll try your solve em.  we are just frustrated because we really want o see it through it's entity without pauses & hiccups--Jonathan
B003G4W49C|5.0|games are kind of odd but the story itself is pretty good. this one should be a good movie.<br />excellent
B0030SZ2D4|4.0|A solid B category action thriller set on a desolate planet.  For a accurate synopsis please read one of the professional reviewer pieces. The bottom line is that Pitch Black is a action packed Vin Diesel outer space futuristic fun to watch movie.  If you don't mind a modest budget sometimes thin plot and enjoy a liberal sprinkling of camp on your home theater popcorn this movie is well worth watching.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|this series is odd but extremely good. I have no idea how many books this series is going to be seems to have a slow build up to move anywhere. however the slow build up is what makes this series so dam good. really good character development i am sure the build up will not disappoint.
B008469DGY|5.0|Flick golf is an interesting and very entertaining app that I recently played. I really enjoyed playing this game. Great app!

0143124544|1.0|I loved, loved, loved this book until near the end.  And then I hated it.  In fact, I not only hated it, it made me furious!! I can't believe that this author felt that the ending was in any way &#34;romantic&#34; or encouraging.  Spoiler - don't read the following paragraphs if you don't want to know what happens.  I hated the ending not because it didn't end up HEA, but because it had no point!!  What a waste of two lives.  One who couldn't be like he used to be, so he ended his.  And one who gave her love to a very selfish young man who couldn't even let her go without dragging her into his sordid end.  Wow!! What a nice guy!     I  feel that this novel is actually  promoting suicide and depression.  Instead of getting help for Will's obvious depression, the characters in the book don't even recognize that depression is &#34;the&#34; major problem.  And instead of using the vast wealth available to them, Will's parents let him rot in his room for months and hope some inexperienced young lady will be able to &#34;save&#34; him.  What about all the technology available these days to better the lives of people like him?  Where was that?  There are many, many people who deal with life-altering circumstances and &#34;choose&#34; to live.  I personally know of two people who had more problems than Will did.  (Both of them were AB people before their injuries.  One can't see or hear but is married, travels and has a job. The other is a quadrapalegic with almost exactly the extent of injuries that Will had. He went to college, got a degree and helped others who had similar issues. He is married too.)  AND, big AND, they didn't have endless money and resources to make their life easier.  This wasn't a story about someone who was in the final stages of cancer, or who was in the throes of death.  This was a story about a very depressed and selfish young man who didn't care about anyone but himself.  He took advantage of a system that is intended for people in who have NO hope and for whom death is imminent.  Not those who feel that they don't have the quality of life they used to have so they want to end it.  That is just plain old suicide!!  Assisted or not.  If this were a true story, the parents and girlfriend would probably have been arrested.  (At least in England or the United States.)  I am so disappointed in this book.  Even if the two main characters didn't stay together, there still could have been a lot of value in the story to show that love makes a difference. Quality of life isn't all about what we can do or have, but we can give and do for others!!!      I have one word to add to this review.  &#34;Gleason&#34;  A real life, inspirational story that shows how life can still be lived in every circumstance.  Bravery vs. cowardliness.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is an amazing view of the actual history of the period.  The Roman conquest of Palestine and the jewish reaction to it generally matches the bibilical accounts, and the authors expanation of the differences make sense.  The tension between the Romans and the jews which culminated in the Jewish revolt in 66 c.e., the &#34;messiahs&#34; of the period, the Jewish nature of Christs mission which is later converted to a non-Jewish divine mission make emminent sense in light of the time period.  I am now reading a history of Christianity by a Catholic Benedictine, which fits Astan book like a hand in a glove.  The conclusion of all this is that you can be a good Christian and still enjoy and believe the Zealot (as both authors state, the defining point of Christianity is the resurrection and ascent of Christ to heaven, and there is no way we can prove that; thus Chrisianity all comes down to faith).
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The book moved me looking at it as a child, as an adult and as a mother. Sometimes I felt like shaking Victoria to reason but I did not feel pity for her. I  knew she could be helped if she allowed others into her life.<br />As the previous reviewer said a great read
B0035XVVDY|5.0|It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. What a great movie and great plot line. It may not be for everyone, but totally awesome! I will be buying this movie!

B00C061I3K|5.0|great music, good variety and a great album. If you don't normally like electronica you might like this album. If you love electronica you might like this album. It's music with a modern feel but styled after different eras of pop.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This was a perfect situation for me. I misplaced the cord for my Kindle and could not use it until I found this replacement on<br />Amazon. I was thrilled with the price but the seller happened to be out of the country which worried me a little. I read the reviews and saw positive remarks. I received the product very quickly and absolutely no complications. It was a new cord in perfect condition and it arrived in adequate packaging. Yea! Now I am back to reading my Kindle again!
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|If you are a fan of this series and want to re-watch it, this is as fine a medium as you can get to own it on. The extras included are also nice and give some more insight into the production, characters, and actors that portray them. Recommended!
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Awesome!!  My little one loves the movie.  Bought it in VHS since it is easier for Grandma to use.  Love the movie.

1250012570|5.0|There's a lot of parts of Eleanor and Park that might seem familiar in your typical teen coming of age/romance story. But Rainbow Rowell writes characters intelligently and with such vivid prose that old tropes seem new in her hands. If you're in highschool check it out and be amazed by how deeply you feel for and relate to these characters. And if your older check it out and feel the angst and verve of youth again.

0741470314|4.0|I downloaded this book to read while on a weeks Holiday. I read it straight through and found it to be quite correct. I wasn't sure what to expect from someone who hadn't actually known Michael Jackson but Karen has done her homework pretty well. The information from the security guards was most interesting as i had never heard what they had to say about Michael. Although many other things in the book i already did know about Him, i found the book so refreshing and thank Karen Moriaty for putting the light on the beautiful Michael Jackson and on the erronous media. This book is truly in defense of a King and is for fans and especially non fans. Thankyou Karen. Worth AT LEAST five stars
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is a blast. My daughter Brynna enjoys it very much. It is a good game for young and old a like.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Sad, poignant story of two unfortunate youths who meet and manage to find meaning in their misfortune. So sad, but worth it.

0345525558|5.0|I enjoyed reading about the meanings of various flowers.  I was also stunned with some of the goings on in regard to foster care,  loved also learning about the running of a vineyard and a flower shop.
B00C25TCZ0|3.0|Not sure that it will blow you way. I just found it hard to appreciate BSR as a &#34;new&#34; band without hearing Thin Lizzy or The Almighty. Good music but it didn't get me too excited.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is one of the best Mahjong games I have found for my Kindle. I can play for hours with all the different layouts and<br />choices of graphics. It seemed too easy at first but its quite challenging. I love the quick response of matching tiles.Its a good time waster but will keep your brain active. Have fun!!
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Not a fan.  The characters were dull and lifeless however, I don't think people are going to watch this movie because they are really hankering for some character development.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|This film was very entertaining with witty humor and some very cool fast paced action scenes.Nothing ground breaking, but definitely a solid movie to watch.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I recently upgraded from a FitBit One that had gone through the wash too many times.<br /><br />The ugly: Firmware quality and consistency<br />When I got the Pulse, it had trouble syncing.  After so many hours, it would just stop syncing.  I had to reset it, perhaps reset the app and/or iPhone, and pray to get it to sync again for a while, before it stopped again.<br />I updated the firmware.  New problem: Now the charge lasts no more than a few hours.  It appeared to be leaving the bluetooth radio on all of the time after a sync.<br />I contacted support and they said it was a known bug and the next firmware update due out in a few days would fix it.  Lo and behold, three days of a paperweight Pulse later a new firmware update appeared, and this one has been rock solid for me thus far.<br />So, my out of the box experience would give the Pulse a 1 star rating.  I will be very very hesitant to update the firmware in the future.<br /><br />The bad:<br />* Support: FitBit support seems to be the stuff of legend.  The Withings support is decidedly less legendary.  I had an okay experience with it.  I've heard of others just not getting responses.<br />* Goals aren't currently adjustable.  I suspect it's only a matter of time until this is enabled.<br /><br />The okay:<br />* The heart rate reader seems (from the app) to be meant to track resting heart rate, and is thus only mildly useful, though it's a nice feel-good.  I do check it most mornings when waking up, as long as it wasn't a loud noise that woke me up, panicking.  I've noticed that if I move when using the heart rate monitor, I tend to get wildly inaccurate readings.  It at least seems accurate if I keep still.<br /><br />The good:  Now, with the fixed firmware (version 761), I'm _extremely_ happy with the Pulse.<br />* The pulse clip is actually large enough that I notice it when changing clothes, and am thus less likely to put it through the wash, which was, for me, the FitBit One's fatal flaw.  (I normally clip the device to the inside of my pants pocket.)<br />* The step tracking seems much more accurate than the FitBit (and thus quite a bit lower), while still tracking my \\"steps\\" on the elliptical.<br />* Pulse reports calories burned from exercise.  The FitBit reported total estimated calories burned per day (from exercise and BMR).  I like the reporting of calories I burn only through exercise as that's the number I can control directly.  In the Withings system, this number isn't hidden by a potentially much larger number that I have no immediate direct control over.<br />* The armband is easier to use than the fitbit armband.  It's sized better for the device, and it's easier to get the Pulse in and out of it.  It's also got a narrower band, which is easier to wrap around my arm.  That means I actually use the sleep tracking on the Pulse, where I just ignored the feature on the FitBit.<br />* And the Pulse integrates better with my old Withings scale.
0061537969|5.0|This is a wonderful book, written from the dog's mouth.  There is so much insight that you almost have to read it twice to get everything.  It is just hard to beat and I look long and hard to find another book as good as this one.  Raven Stole the Moon comes close, but this is really a book to treasure and read at least two times.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I took advantage of today's free offer of this app and tried it out on my Nook HD+. I found it very easy to operate. It opens initially in the volume control portion of the app and you just press the EQ button to get into the equalizer mode. Right below the equalizer sliders is the presets button; pressing that opens up a drop-down menu with various presets.<br /><br />I used the settings suggested by the top reviewer (1st, 3rd and 5th sliders to the top, 2nd and 4th sliders slightly above the middle) and played Adele's &quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot;. There was a noticeable improvement in the sound, with the instruments and her voice all sounding clearer and fuller. I was also able to scale the volume down (I normally have it set at max volume).<br /><br />Music Volume EQ will remain in your notification bar once the music stops, but if you want to shut the program down completely, just do a long press on the on/off button.<br /><br />This is definitely one free offer that's worth taking advantage of,  and would even be worth buying.

B004G8P2M8|5.0|I found this story to be a great mystery crime story coming form Hammett.  Having read some of his previous works, this had a slight touch of levity with the banter between the husband and wife team. The story is so much richer than the movie, and I hope that you dont watch that schlock till after you read this, as there are insanely richly developed characters that the movie washes over for lack of creativity and of time. The book had an ending that left me happily surprised, I think this story will leave you satisfied with a great hard boiled story from one of the greatest masters in American literature.
B00A7KKPDK|1.0|Love Ellen but this book is not interesting and has no meaning. Just a lot of talking about nothing. Never read her other ones so I'm not sure if this is how she writes her books.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Simply excellent. Excellently simple. The app is easy to read and clear. I like that it shows what was keyed in an area below the solution which is very useful for those who are used to adding machine tape.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great series to get into. Lots of drama and keeps you entertained. The show made me get into the books.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app! Even had it on my other phones when with other carriers. It's a must-have. The most up to date weather info on locations across the country. And you can't beat the price.
B00AEBB8BU|5.0|It's about energy--oil. Getting it for Americans.  People at the top thinking for the general population. Leaders (?) thinking they know what we want, ultimately. Not caring how they get it. Leaders acting as though there is no moral center to guide them. It's as deep as the wells that are drilled and we are doomed to repeat the terrible lessons History has for the greedy. It makes you think even at our level, we have to find alternatives. Can't understand why things like electric cars come out vastly overpriced. Wrote Ford Motor Company middle level executive years ago about making electric cars--not in the Explorer class but the Escort class, with lower prices to appeal the masses, so they could sell them by the millions--and have profits the old-fashioned way: through high volume sales. At the end of the letter I asked the Dearborn folks to think about how Henry Ford would have brought electric cars to the masses. I asked them to drive around their neighborhoods and stop at the driveways that had old Fords in them and ask why people held onto the cars. Did anyone get in touch with me?  Wait for it---wait--no...
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|I am a prime member and have rented and purchased movies with the instant video service several times.  Most of the time it works great, but when I really am in the mood for a particular movie the buffering starts at the most inopportune moments!!!  I understand that it may be a function of my internet provider (Time Warner), but for whatever reason, why would I keep paying for this service when it does not give me the desired result.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|As always Gerber products are top of the line. Extremely well made from the tool itself to the case. Excellent compact design.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always liked to play solitaire, since I was a kid. Love it on my Kindle Fire and IPad. The only problem I have is knowing when to quit.....just one more game, just one more game..... lol
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I like the game but do not like being forced to write a review even if I don't want to.
0393327655|5.0|If the recent outrages haven't yet convinced thinking people everywhere of the dangers inherent in unthinking people wielding power, one wonders if anything will. A good, start, however, might be made by reading Sam Harris's book, which represents a very persuasive argument outlining the follies of following the medieval superstitions we know as organized religions - of any stripe - and their instruction books, the Bible, and the Koran etc.<br /><br />His argument, of course, is rational and at its beginning Harris ponders the absurdity of great swathes of humanity held in thrall by beliefs that have no more bases in reality than the Easter bunny or Santa Claus, which, in itself is somewhat odd considering the fact that great swathes of humanity behave irrationally a great deal of the time. One only has to consider, for instance, the extreme way in which normally sane and well-balanced people are liable to act when under the influence of those states of mind we call falling and being `in love'. And that's only one example; there are many more where that comes from!<br /><br />The argument goes, of course, that Christ said, `blessed are they who have not seen yet still believe', or words to that effect depending on which translation you use. And herein lies the appeal to justification by faith. Yet for those who believe in God (or, Allah or Brahma) the creator, it should not have escaped their notice that He also endowed human beings with minds with which to think and to reason. Therefore, to act contrary to the fruit of reason in accordance with the dictates of blind faith is also to deny the fact that God herself must also, by definition, being perfect, be perfectly rational.<br /><br />In support of his argument Harris trots out the usual impressive litany of atrocities committed in the names of God, which in itself represents an abomination; together with an equally impressive list of quotes from the various instruction manuals exhorting the faithful to `stone',`force to drink scalding water', `annihilate', `put to death', or `burn in fire' etc. unbelievers. Those who manage to escape such human interventions will, eventually, `endure eternal hell' or `damnation', or `become the inmates of hell', or be `sternly punished' or, `sigh with remorse but never come out of the fire' etc. the other side of the grave.<br /><br />A salutary read, indeed!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|The male voice of a angel . A gifted talented man  enjoy his  music very very much . Recommend this . and all his albums .
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I'll admit that I'm a bit of a Trekkie, but I prefer the later shows to the original series, so for me this just doesn't cut it as a Star Trek film. Anyway let's put that aside as this is what Star Trek is now. The first film was ok as an action teen flick set in space and this continues along the same lines.<br /><br />And for me that's the big problem with it. It feels like a bunch of kids playing at spaceships, the characters aren't convincing. Spock isn't too bad and Peter Weller does a reasonable job as the admiral. Some of the characters (Scotty in particular) are just too silly to take seriously.<br /><br />Ok, so it's not a serious film, but the problem is that it has a feel of a high budget comedy that isn't funny. Everyone is trying to keep a straight face, but the audience doesn't get what they find funny.<br /><br />What the film does deliver however is an audio visual treat. It looks stunning and sounds superb and to be fair it's worth watching for the spectacle of it alone. It drags on a little bit, but not too much. I didn't like it, but I was entertained by it. I was glad I rented rather than bought it though.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|You have to listen to the story line and understand what has happened to be able to follow this movie . So many people complain this is wrong  that is wrong  .  The TIME LINE HAS BEEN CHANGED PEOPLE NOTHING IS THE SAME AS BEFORE .  awesome movie . the idiots who complain are not trekies and should just STFU and  not review .
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Helen Hunt was fantastic and her acting was done in great taste.  Story was presented well and I would watch it again.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was wonderful I liked how it gripped my attention without it wavering for a second. I enjoyed the detail of the emotions that the characters were displaying. I would highly recommend this book.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Great classic dance movie.  A bunch of friends getting together in a few weeks to watch it.  Great music& dancing
0064471837|5.0|This is one of those books that sticks with you. Ten years after my first read, Sabriel is still my favorite character of all time. The novel is beautifully written, dark, and unique. The concept of walking through death and using bells to wake the dead (or put them to sleep) is interesting as well. I don't think anyone who I've recommended the book to has had a bad word to say about it. And usually, they want to borrow Lirael next ;).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finished this book in about two days. Once the Hunger Games begin, there's never a full moment, and that had me turning the pages well into the night.
B001TCHDPS|3.0|Coldfact and Searching For Sugarman couldn't get any better. The producer of Coming From Reality totally changed Rodriguez' sound and tried to turn ihis lyrics into an orchestral troubadour  genre. Talk about destroying a sound. There are a couple songs done in the &#34;Sugar Man&#34; style but on most of them you'd never know the singer/songwriter was Rodriguez. I'd like to see this work reproduced in Motown and keep the sound and style of Rodriguez.  Why try to change what works.  Like changing Dylan s style into Michael Buble's.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I use love playing this game with fronds at school and family at home. I teach this game to my 5 year old. perfect for all ages and great game to get family together and not exclude the little ones lol
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I've had this for a few days and i like it. Its cute. The bright colors are aesthetically pleasing.  Cute idea.
074356619X|5.0|After having seen and read The Secret - I wanted a copy that I could listen to on the road while traveling to work and this set just does that.  I find myself listening to it over and over - or whenever I feel the need for a little inspiration and remembrance of being positive.  Just as it states on the c.d. - either you believe it or you don't, either way you are correct, and that is so true.<br /><br />I for one believe and I think that if you are contemplating purchasing this, you cannot go wrong.  It is a great, uplifting c.d. set.  Try it out!
B0038P59A0|5.0|I love this movie! It has great action scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat along with wick and witty humor. Casting is great!
0399255370|5.0|Read this book before giving to my 5 year old grandson - thought it was well written and illustrated. Sure he will  like it.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Too bad I'm too cheap to spring for HBO. :) Thank goodness I can buy the DVDs and get caught up. This is a great, very adult rated show. It has it all. Sex, violence, special effects, great story line, fascinating characters you really come to care for. I cried when the big guy died. Not going to say who since I don't want to spoil it for others, and this show is chock full of big, hunky guys so unless you've watched it you won't know who right off. Just got season two and I'm looking forward to viewing it, soon.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Easy to use on my iphone.  Enjoy this application and keeping in touch with recommendations from others in my network.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love this game. Challenging but not ridiculous, nice graphics. Fun all around 2nd time thru and still love it!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Just when you think you can't keep all the characters straight, their lives all suddenly tie together.  Truly thought provoking.
0802130208|1.0|I actually hated this book.  I found it gross, unfunny and repetitious. I quit half way through, which I rarely do.
B00DPH7QFM|3.0|I pretty much agree with everything that's been said already by others. My question though is where's the low end? I've played this disc on 2 different setups and the bass is lacking in both. Even after adjusting the EQ and tweaking the subwoofer the kick drum and bass guitar are mostly AWOL.
0143038583|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I sent it as a gift to my grandson, 16, who is a superb amateur chef. He also enjoyed Pollan's lively, informative, and very well written book. This is not a book just for 'foodies' , but for the general public as well, as it delves into the ways our food are grown, marketed, used and misused, and impacts on very important current political and economic issues. It's a must read, and well worth your time.
B004X80QNG|2.0|There's a lot better ones out there that was easier to use and better formatted. Honestly I don't see the need to keep my contacts in with my daily schedule and to do list... or wait maybe I do because that's why I own a smart phone. It's basically a replacement for a paper daytimer.... which is why most of us use smart phones and tablets. It's already kept in one neat place. This is redundant.
B008X8RSTM|5.0|This is a wonderful app! And it doesn't take up data usage!  Great for travelling anywhere.  We are using it in England.DR
B007EDYN36|5.0|A good guy who turned bad but then turned good again!  Peter is still my favorite no matter what he did in the past.  Sounds like he has learned from his mistakes.
B00CSYR432|4.0|I have two young daughters of 8 and 6.5 and they have both inherited my love of Ghibli and Miyazaki.  Although Poppy Hill does not have the fantasy element of many of the prior films they were still enchanted with the sweet, quiet story and characterizations.  We watched the Blu-ray and the detail of the picture showing the famous Ghibli backgrounds was wonderful as usual.  A young, industrious sophomore girl balances her home life caring for borders and her life at high school where she slowly becomes enamored of the ostensible leader of the local extra-curricular club house.  Sometimes it's nice to slow down the pace and just enjoy a languid story with no real conflict like Arrietty or Whispers of the Heart.  Everyone enjoyed watching it, recommended 4.5 of 5.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This is a must have for anyone listening to music. This actually enhances the performance of the headphones. This app allows you to take your listening experience to a whole new realm.
B00A86AIAI|5.0|This is a very well made statue ! I researched it on youtube extensively before buying on amazon and it is as good in person as it is on all the reviews.I great addition to my 7&#34; Predator collection !Fits in nicely !
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather information accuracy and delivery (ease of understanding the information and presentation of the information) is outstanding.  The Weather locations are accurate as I move around. I like being able to look up weather in several locations.  It's a great planning tool for making decisions about daily and weekly activities.
B003LL3LHO|4.0|This story written by two of the genre's best, is a fine adventure story. I enjoyed the quest tropes and was just what I was in the mood for. It's not deep but doesn't need to be. An entertaining read.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The story contains some interesting ideas but the ending was predictable.  The author should have ended the story with the defeat of the enemy. The use of the &#34;N&#34; word seemed out of place and inappropriate.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I am so glad someone recommended this to me.  Haunting tale of inhumanity.  The world needs to demand more.  We need to pay more attention.  Truth can absolutely be more horrific than fiction.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  It works well on my Kindle, and has very nice graphics.  All of the Playrix games are fun.
1476733953|5.0|Hugh Howey's subterranean, post-apocalyptic world is a well defined, character driven (including the 'character' of the Silo itself!) page turner that is not only a great story, but the background of how this book came to be is just as amazing.<br />Support Hugh Howey, the little guy who made his dream come true and reward yourself with a story that has it all. You won't be disappointed.
B009ME47H2|5.0|Well I think this is great it's the best because my little sister loves to say funny things to it. It's just great you can even use this as a reminder. It's awesome!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|My whole family loves this movie. It has everything. Just watch it; and if you have a child like mine, you will watch it over and over.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|This is my first purchase from the LEGO modular buildings series. It is my first lego purchase in a long long time, and I think this is a great standalone set, but I do plan on purchasing more of these modular buildings. I'd say this set is good value for the money, as it has many interesting features. I would definitely rather purchase a big set like this than a bunch of little sets. Plus, once the set is built, it looks very impressive, even better than in pictures.
B000W93CHC|5.0|As with Pillars of the Earth, this was a well researched, well written book. The story lines were interwoven masterfully. I couldn't get to the next page soon enough, cover to cover. Well done Ken Follett.
0688091717|5.0|I read it to my three-year-old granddaughter, when we were on vacation.  I read it with a lot of dramatic emphasis and added my own comments to the narration.  She loved it!
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|**As with most of my reviews, I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review\\"<br /><br />Derived from the previous tale, the poems included in Peter. Enchantment, and Stardust-The Poems(Peter: A Darkened Fairytale 2)took me in immediately. It was quite a followup to the story, almost like a deluxe version of a previous album. Because I am a lover of Poetry, I actually read this collection a few times, and they were better with each read. Bravo!!
0307394549|5.0|We bought this for my daughter-in-law.  She's an inspired cook.  We all look forward to what she's going to do with these recipes for the holidays,  good for all holidays and year 'round.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I liked this book and didn't like this  book. Story lines ended abruptly and I found myself  waiting for the different plots to make sense and relate to one another. Parts  of the story I enjoyed but wanted more clarity from the story line.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game I love it play it every day of my life I like it better than facebook and youtube
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I enjoy this game. It is fun and keeps you moving. Always watchuing whick color bubble comes up to make sure not to shoot the wrong one.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This a good product that you can't beat for the price. It connects to my bluetooth earbuds in a few seconds
B000YQ9X7G|5.0|You do NOT have to wait until Christmas to open this gift. &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34;(1946) is THE feel good movie of the all time. It should be watched anytime you need a lift!(Okay, Okay , you can watch it at Christmas time too!).<br /><br />ASC(Angel Second Class), Clarence Oddbody needs to get his wings.George Bailey is desperately in need of an Angel. So the powers up above arrange a meeting. It's a story made in heaven.<br /><br />Clarence gets to view George Bailey's life from the time he was a young boy until the present, when George is having so many problems he thinks he would be better off if he'd never been born (it may be safe to say we have all had days like that!). We watch as George touches the lives of so many from boyhood to adulthood. He saves his brother's life,he stops his boss(a druggist) from making a fatal mistake, he saves the family business, &#34;The Building and Loan Assoc,&#34; from the hands of the Scrooge-like Mr. Potter; is friend and mentor to so many, and although never gets to follow his dreams of travel, settles down with the girl next door in his town, Bedford Falls.<br /><br />But things start going amiss for poor George; an accidental misplacement of a large sum of money and the auditor showing up just at the wrong time, causes George to face loosing everything he THINKS is important. He's on the bridge, ready to pack it all in when his guardian angel Clarence shows up in the nick of time.Clarence shows George what life would REALLY be like if he was never born. It's not good! George must realize that &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; before he can exist again.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey. He is just tremendous in this role. We see the full range of his talents as he runs the course of going from carefree, to distraught, to bitter and finally elated with life as he discovers Zuzu's petals have reappeared in his pocket.The petals that disappeared from his pocket when he disappeared from existence. Henry Travers is Clarence and there has never been a more cherubic angel than he. Donna Reed as Mary(George's wife) is exceptional at making a wonderful life for George and looking great doing it. And Lionel Barrymore is the mean Mr. Potter who we love to hate. There are so many other famous faces to look for that do such a superb job, here are a few...the great character actor Thomas Mitchell is the forgetful &#34;Uncle Billy&#34;, Lillian Randolph is &#34;Annie&#34;, the housekeeper, Beulah Bondi as Mrs. Bailey, Ellen Corby, the lady who only wants $17.50, Gloria Grahame is Violet and don't miss Carl &#34;Alfalfa&#34; Switzer, mischievous as ever at the pool scene.<br /><br />So it's clear as a bell(oh..I think an Angel just got his wings!)if you're feeling a little down, watch this movie and like Zuzu's petals, your smile will reappear.<br /><br />Happy Trails......Laurie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once again, what a great experience getting to be a voyeur into the early 20th century and the lives of a few of the noble and working class of England.  Beautiful cinematography, incredible acting.  What a great show.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This my favorite game on kindle and I like it because I've watched all of the episodes and know you make it come alive with creating you're own village and image of ponyville<br />and canterlot.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|A huge chunk of it talks about having kids, working while having kids, how to have kids, breastfeeding, everything related to having kids. If you don't have kids currently or don't plan to (like me) then a huge section of this book won't be useful to you.  I wish I had known that before buying it, because I wouldn't have.
B00CSYRHG6|4.0|Studio ghibli will be in good hands with miyazaki's son creating works of art like this..looking forward to more from his son
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book is way way much better than the movie. Practically another story. Love the book but not the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't been this engrossed in a book in a very long time! Even the &#34;slow&#34; parts of the book will keep you caught in the story! I highly recommend this book for anyone who has lost faith in reading as I did!
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|I was a fan of the iOS version of glow hockey, and this game is just as good, but I would like the paddle to be more responsive. You can give up a lot of goals because the paddle can't keep up with your finger.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|Harry is one of the least known best voices in the Rock catalog.  His shenanigans with John Lennon are legendary.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked this a lot. Other reviews have already said that this app has a good mix of gameplay mechanics, I agree. My one gripe is the achievements associated with the hidden object/card matching game . If you, like me enjoy achievement hunting; you might be disappointed to learn that you can't get  both the complete all card games and the hidden object achievements in one run.<br />As I said I'm nitpicking. The game is worth your$0.99. Buy it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I really enjoy watching this show. Very strange robots with powerful guns but love it when we beat them.The alien thing on the back, somebody really has an active mind to connect it to the brain and the spine. Great show.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is the perfect weather app for those of. US who like things easy and quick. We live in Indiana where the weather is so crazy, and I like to check on it regularly as I plan my day.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|this book was the best thing that ever happened to me. After reading the first book and being totally drawn into it the second book wrapped me back in and wouldn't let me go. This book has all the things that great books should have .
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app lets me pin, repin, and like, just like on any pc or mac. it is very cool how many things pintrest has to offer. Go on, try it!!!!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I cannot copy text, I can't safe to pdf or print out, etc. Very limited. I prefer Kobo or others. Seems as if Amazon has total control over the product. But...the book is inexpensive and the app is free.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|15 words required for this review... well, the book that I am reading at this moment is excellent, funny, to the point. Thanks
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I love Something Borrowed but Something Blue was way better. In Borrowed Darcy is so self centered (she is in Blue too) but you still feel for her considering what her best friend and fiancé are up to. I love this book, wish they did the movie for this one too. John Krasinski and Kate Hudson brought these characters to life, now let us see what happens in London!
0307352153|5.0|Very well written...this book should be required reading for all extroverts...everyone does not have to be loud, obnoxious and the center of attention to be a leader or to be successful.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a fun and challenging game, fun to play and move through the levels.  Not  always easy to figure out what is next.
B002SKZBQS|4.0|Stephen King, over the last thirty odd years, has managed to entertain me enthrall me, make me envious, frighten the hell out of me, and cause me to contemplate life. At age fifty-one I am turning back time and re-reading his earlier works, and they are just as good the second time around, perhaps better because I have witnessed King's evolution as a writer.<br />Roadwork is one of King's early &#34;what if&#34; stories that delves deep into the psyche of a man pushed into a proverbial corner. What other writer could make the character of Dawes sympathetic?  No one but the master..King himself. Thank you, Mr. King for the stories.<br />Signed, Constant. Reader.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|got this for the cute factor. now I can't put down. only four stars because it kills my battery. too fun.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|The Blu-ray version is definitely worth the extra money. The quality is outstanding. I'm looking forward to purchasing the entire series on Blu-ray.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|An amazingly refreshing and different movie. Enjoyed every minute of it!!  A movies great for any day of the week.
0811866351|5.0|Beautifully drawn and put together. I couldnt put it down!! The art was very rich and vivid. I felt like I could reach inside and grab the plants.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Fun game. Movement could be a bit smoother. My 3 yr old likes to play it and so do I.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonderful!  Great book club choice for middle schoolers, heart warming and inspiring.  A quick and satisfying read, I definitely recommend it.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Giving 4 stars for effort here! Excellent graphics, lots of action & basically, NO BLOOD! Dracula, Richard Roxburgh, looks scary if you're maybe ... 8 or 9yrs old!! Hugh Jackman makes a good Van Helsing & Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous! Good Friday nite family film for Halloween!
0800177177|5.0|Vampires are supposed to be shape-shifting, mesmerizing, blood-sucking beasts & Gary Oldman pulls this off better than just about everyone else! Anthony Hopkins, enuff said! Winona Ryder- sweet & innocent & Keanu Reeves, too-trusting fool! Excellent film!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like this game alot. It brings me back to when I was back in junior high school. Good job really.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Very happy with this purchase.  I love the band and having it on icloud immediately was a big bonus for me.
B001I8A76A|5.0|Pink is awesome and always will be!! What more can I say really? Nothing but Amazon thinks reviews require a few more words ;-)
B001POX73C|5.0|This book was a delight to read and kept me guessing until the very end.  A great cast of characters and some hilarious dialogue makes this book a great read and hard to put down!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Highly recommend this book. The author`s five year old perspective comes across authentic & adds so much humanity to an already darkly compelling story only recently mirrored in the headlines.
0446554995|5.0|This one wraps up the series of events facing Agent Pendergast. Be prepared for lots of surprises (as with the others) and a not necessarily good ending; but, an ending never the less.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|Nice to finally have these classic tunes in stereo! The music of the &#34;Fab Four&#34; still rocks all these years later!
B00867GJYK|1.0|when I open the package, the dvd case is broken. And this is three disc edition but I cannot find the third disc.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Suspenseful and enjoyable all the way through. An amazing cast of actors who did a terrific job. A totally different plot with the focus on crime and magic. Couldn't be more interesting.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|So many real life stories and tragedies. It was interesting to read what the characters were thinking and feeling about their life choices. Very perceptive author.
B000JML90Y|5.0|After reading the first edition of the great man's work, I can state with confidence Darwin was a great theorist and a daring and innovative thinker. Which is admittedly a bit like saying that Einstein was quite intelligent or that Galileo had a few good ideas in his day. Still, with Darwin's originality and his very character often under attack, it's good to actually read the man himself and realize that in this case conventional wisdom is conventional because it's true.<br /><br />The idea of evolution itself was not original, and many obtuse critics of Darwin naively point to the existence of pre-Darwinian evolutionary ideas in order to claim that he was merely a plagiarist. But Darwin's original conception was that evolution was a *population-level* process occurring among varying individuals and that this population-level process occurred by the statistical overrepresentation of some variants due to early death or failure to beget offspring. The centrality of this to understanding evolutionary theory today cannot be overemphasized. Darwin's statistical insights in biology were no less revolutionary in their implications and discombobulating to his contemporaries than Ludwig Boltzmann's insights were in the field of thermodynamics. Prior to and even for some time after Darwin, evolution was seen as a process driven by some kind of inner striving or by some motive force pushing individuals to ever 'higher' or more 'complex' forms. Darwin's conception did away with not only any need for the design argument and special creation, but also with any need for these mystical forces and strivings that supposedly made evolution possible.<br /><br />People often say you can read the first half of the book, or even just the first four chapters (up to \\"Natural Selection\\") and understand Darwin's thought. Perhaps you can understand natural selection, but for my money the most dazzling originality comes in the latter half, where Darwin lays out the case for evolution in the most convincing manner. This was the section that wowed his contemporaries and led to evolution -- but not necessarily natural selection -- being accepted nearly overnight. If I were on the fence about evolution vs. special creation, Darwin on biogeography (\\"Geographic Distribution\\") alone would have been sufficient to convince me. It would have thrilled Darwin to see that his insights have been picked up on and expanded by the development of plate tectonics, which solves his most problematic cases. At one point Darwin writes, \\"The affinity, which, though feeble, I am assured by Dr. Hooker is real, between the flora of the south-western corner of Australia and of the Cape of Good Hope, is a far more remarkable case, and is at present inexplicable: but this affinity is confined to the plants, and will, I do not doubt, be some day explained.\\" This affinity was very well explained by the discovery that South America, Africa, Antarctica, the Indian subcontinent, and Australia were all joined in a single land mass called Gondwana. Southwestern Australia and the Cape Peninsula of South Africa were once near neighbors.<br /><br />Darwin is equally convincing in the discussion of biostratigraphy (\\"On The Geological Succession of Organic Beings\\"). Why should we see a consistent pattern of fewer and fewer modern species, then fewer and fewer modern genera, fewer and fewer modern families, and so on, as we go down deeper into the fossil record? Why do these fossil forms show affinities to each other and to the creatures now living on top of them? Creationists try to explain biostratigraphy by means of two hypotheses from \\"flood geology\\": \\"higher\\" organisms outran the \\"lower\\" ones from the increasing floodwaters, and hydrodynamic sorting explains the rest. But neither of these fit the facts. If marine fossils on mountains are supposed to be evidence for Noah's flood, why don't we find human fossils and artifacts in these same mountainous layers? Did the flower-bearing plants (angiosperms) outrun the cone-bearing plants (conifers)? Did both outrun the ferns and mosses? And if hydrodynamic sorting explains the fossil record, why does it show the pattern of fewer and fewer modern species, genera, etc. as one goes further down? Have we all been getting smaller and lighter over history -- including the blue whale? Why don't we see whale fossils mixed in with benthic (bottom-dwelling) trilobites? Why do we see microfossils (pollen, diatoms, foraminifera, etc.) exhibit the same patterns as the larger fossils when they're all roughly the same size and should have all floated to the top?<br /><br />The number of issues evolution resolves but no other view can is simply astonishing when one begins to contemplate them. That was Darwin's argument and his key concern. He saw with tremendous clarity both what his own theory implied for the existing real-world observations of naturalists and what they might accomplish for the natural sciences in the future. Here too he was ahead of his time because 150 years later we're still doing work, often in fields Darwin couldn't even conceive of, by using evolutionary principles. It's Darwin's world and we're just living in it.

B00CHVJODE|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />Actually, the eponymous family in Dreamworks' \\"The Croods\\" doesn't really have all that much in common with the Flintstones.  For example, they don't have the Flintstones' primitive technological conveniences like the Flintmobile.  The Croods don't even have primitive weapons like spears and clubs, and sometimes they even run on all fours like gorillas or chimpanzees.  What's worse, they live in an otherworldly, dangerous prehistoric environment that makes \\"Jumanji\\" look like a petting zoo.  Therefore, in a way, you really can't blame burly Crood father/leader Grug (voice of Nicolas Cage) for being maniacally preoccupied with keeping his family safe.<br /><br />This bunch of pre-Neanderthals - Grug's wife Ugga (voice of Catherine Keener), slow-witted and klutzy middle son Thunk (Clark Duke), fierce and animalistic toddler daughter Sandy (voice of Randy Thom), caustic Gran (voice of Cloris Leachman), and especially independent-minded elder daughter Eep (voice of Emma Stone) - are all agile, swift and strong fighters.  Even so, the Croods are so cautious and fearful that they venture out into the wild only long enough to forage for food (as in the energetic keep-away/football game they play with a wild bird-type to capture its egg toward the film's start).  Then, it's off to the safety of the cave, with a boulder door to keep the beasts out.  Following Grug's motto of \\"Life is fear, all the time\\", the family even sleeps curled up in a ball for mutual safety.  Except for teenage daughter Eep, who increasingly resents her family's lack of daring, curiosity, and eagerness to explore and learn.<br /><br />One night, breaking curfew, Eep literally runs into a good-looking Cro-Magnon type named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and his all-purpose miniature sloth Belt (voice of Chris Sanders). Though somewhat inferior to Eep in power and athletic prowess, Guy is inventive, self-reliant, and keen on learning new things.  All of Guy's qualities attract Eep to him, although Guy is a bit put-off by Eep's rough and yes, crude, manner.  But Guy really doesn't have a choice; Eep brings Guy to meet the fam, who manage to appall Guy even more.  Grug is equally unimpressed and a bit wary of Guy in turn, not only because of a budding relationship with Eep, but also because Guy's intelligent and adventuresome boldness reflects badly on Grug's ignorant timidity. Taken aback, Guy at first tries to leave.<br /><br />But natural, seismic upheavals and the terrain change caused by Pangea's splintering force Guy and the Croods to work together to cross the treacherous landscape to find a new home.  Can Guy's ideas and experience coupled with the Croods' brawn and agility get them through?  Can Grug surmount his shortcomings to help his family get through?  Will Grug realize - as Eep and Guy do - that courage as well as exposure to new ideas will help them not only survive, but also prosper?<br /><br />\\"The Croods\\" answers these questions with an unexpected blend of knockabout slapstick, sharp but not harsh verbal humor (not even the death fantasies Grug harbors for his mother-in law Gran), and relevant life lessons about survival, facing your inhibitions, maturing, using both strength and intelligence to move ahead and expand your horizons.  Therefore, \\"The Croods\\" will probably enthrall all family members, from fidgety toddlers to thoughtful, sophisticated adults, as they watch the Croods, especially stick-in-the-mud Grug, tackle the challenge of evolution in all senses of the word.ities attract Eep to him, although Guy is a bit put-off by Eep's rough and yes, crude, manner.

B00CVCG87O|2.0|I've been tinkering in this genre since listening to Disperse, and while the complex rhythms, timing, and musicianship seem to scratch an itch of mine, I cannot get by the vocals. Ashe has a good voice, but for me it does not complement this style of music. Don't get me wrong...I am no fan of cookie-monster vocals, but to me this music is aggressive progressive and needs vocals to match.

The only thing that others have said they don't like about the Newport is that they stink when worn barefoot.  I always wear socks with mine; people laugh at me (including my wife) and I don't care.  I usually wear bike socks or the new, wool socks and never have a problem with odor.

B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I admit, The Impossible was a movie I'd picked up for my wife. I didn't expect to like it. I figured the first few minutes would be compelling, like in [[ASIN:B004NOH9LW Hereafter]] (which was also a good movie) but that the tone would take a 90 degree turn after. And it did, but that was a great thing.<br />The first half of the movie had Naomi Watts' character and her son fighting against the tide to not only survive, but reunite with each other. Once the water recedes, we see they the extent of the damage and are left to wonder how anyone could have survived. But the story is focused on the family of five and we see the mother's mangled leg. That's all the foreshadowing we need to know something bad is going to happen.<br />Until this point we are left to believe her husband and two younger sons are dead. Minor spoiler, but they aren't. After she and her son make it to relative safety, the story jumps to Ewan McGregor's character as he searches for his wife and son. I don't want to give away the whole thing, but when McGregor finally gets a cell phone and is able to call home-the way he loses it really gets to you.<br />The drama definitely doesn't end after the tsunami is over. The one drawback is the extreme coincidence that happens at the end. It's a little on the heavy-handed side and strikes as disingenuous. But other than that, it's a great family film if the kiddies can take a minor scare or two.<br /><br />Gerald Rice<br />Author of [[ASIN:B007L79E8E Tales from an Apartment]]

B00A2H9OZS|4.0|The third installment of The Chronicles of Riddick<br />starts off with a bang. We find him already stranded on an unknown planet, left for dead. He's severely injured and immediately has to battle for his life.<br />Through a flashback, we find out what went wrong on the necromonger ship (if you want even more of the backstory you can read the online comic), but in true Furyan fashion, his powers of recuperation have him up and running in short order.<br />But this new planet has treacherous lifeforms ready to kill at a moment's notice. The leopard dogs and water-dwelling creatures that have a very crafty attack prove to be all a severely injured Riddick can handle, but he adapts and eventually finds some sort of a bounty hunters' PlayStation where he alerts mercs that he is alive  and waiting.<br />Two crews show up in short order. One is intent on bringing Riddick back dead, the other has a more clandestine agenda. There is a minor twist that plays out through the rest of the movie and by the end you're mot really sure which way it plays out.<br />There are some pretty cool kills like a merc who's killed by a couple predator-restraints and Riddick displays a fair amount of bravado. But if you liked the other two movies, particularly Pitch Black, you'll like this one. There's a storm coming and when it finally arrives, the entire environment changes.<br />I'd give this movie 3 out of five stars. There's something cutesy that happens early on, but they keep it to a minimum and it actually plays into the story. The ending leaves room for another installment which I'd definitely be in line for.<br /><br />Gerald Rice<br />Author of [[ASIN:B008CRLE6M The Zombie Show]]

B00DHNBPA6|4.0|I have to confess it's been many years since I saw the original Evil Dead<br />movie, but I did remember the storyline in large part. The 2013 iteration follows a group of four people who have gathered to support a friend battling to kick a nasty drug addiction.<br />I like how they took only a boiled down version of the original. I'm not sure if any of the names are the same but the idea in your head of the person you think will survive will be shaken up by story's end. Truly, they have taken a story you know and made it their own.<br />And the movie doesn't rely on CGI. In fact, if it is used at all, it's subtle and noticeable and hearkens back to the Raimi original. There is a lot of gore, including a scene where a character has about a gallon of blood vomited into her mouth, but it's not done in a way that seems like it's trying to top its predecessor.<br />And the story works well into the horror. It makes sense why the people don't want to leave until it's too late and it makes sense why they all came there to begin with.<br />Per usual, there are things that happen that don't make sense and characters who behave contrary to logic, but a little if that is to be expected. None of the negatives ever overpower the film including what one of the main characters does near the end.<br />This film puts me in mind of the Fright Night remake where they inject a lot of common sense into the actions of the characters. Nobody does anything because it would be convenient to the story; they have actual motivations that propel the story.<br />I highly recommend this movie to fans of the original. It didn't need to be a remake; it could have stood as its own movie but it wouldn't have gotten near the attention it deserves.<br /><br />Gerald Rice<br />Author of [[ASIN:0983854718 The Zombie Show]]

B00D6QU6RW|5.0|In the 90s I was simply not into boy bands, but having grown up in those years there was absolutely no way to NOT hear about them. They were everywhere and they dominated the charts for most of my teenage and young adult years. Recently, I heard one of their songs play on the radio and I felt a deep sense of nostalgia. Because, let's be honest, even if you weren't into them back then somehow you had heard the songs, somewhere, all the time. I looked them up on YouTube and started listening to their hits...I was BLOWN away. Ok, so I get why I was not a fan back then, my thing was punk, grunge, alternative, techno, etc. But WOW, this was excellent, well made pop music...I kind of regret not giving them a chance back then. But I finally discovered what every BSB fan already knew. These men weren't just a boy band. They are musicians and I've totally and completely become a fan. GET THE ALBUM!

B00CP4RZIO|5.0|I've been a big Chimaira fan for over 10 years, saw them life twice. I wasn't totally sure what I'd expect after the sudden line up change. But, WOW! was I pleasantly surprised. I think the new line-up did a great job understanding what Chimaira's type of metal is suppose to be. For example, I've noticed that since Resurrection, Chimaira took on the Meshuggah-influenced odd timed riffs. Particularly the songs \\"No Mercy\\" and \\"I Despise\\" showcase the new line-up's awesome ability to incorporate the odd timed riffs. I think the sounds effects have improved with Sean Z handling them now. The short instrumental \\"The Transmigration\\" is catchy in its own way. I like how some of the synthesizers are programed, some remind me of the synthesizers used in soundtrack for the first Terminator. And of course gotta love that 808 bass tone, glad they kept it, its be one of the signatures of the band's sound. If you have at least a fairly good system in you car, that where the 808 stands out the most. More so in the car, than you home stereo system.<br /><br />When I listen to the album, I can tell a certain progression in the songwriting; even though its two different line-up's that I'm comparing. I think that goes back to the new line-up's ability to understand what kind of metal Chimaira offers. I hear this progression when I listen to the song \\"Wrapped in Violence\\". It reminds me of the song \\"Sphere\\" of Pass Out Of Existence, I mean that in the best way. But if you imagine a band that became better song writers of the years and decided to challenge themselves by incorporating what they learned over the years to the Pass Out Of Existence style of writing, if that makes sense. Speaking of the that, I play guitar and there is a guitar observation that I'd like to make. I love that fact that this line-up brought back the 7-string guitar. I was always a little upset that that old line-up seemed to run from the 7-string after they put out The Impossibility Of Reason.<br /><br />All in all, the new version of Chimaira did a great job on this album. Much better then The Age Of Hell. Although there is one characteristic I noticed that they did not display. Us die hard Chimaira fans know what it is, right? No 10 minutes instrumentals like \\"Implements Of Destruction\\" or \\"The Heart Of It All\\". I have my fingers crossed that they are saving that for the next album (Please, oh please do one for the next album).<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: \\"No Mercy\\", \\"I Despise\\", \\"Plastic Wonderland\\", \\"Spineless\\", \\"Kings Of The Shadow World\\", \\"Wrapped In Violence\\", \\"Love Soaked Death\\".all, the new version of Chimaira did a great job on this album.

1475143389|5.0|I read a lot if health and fitness books along with a lot of pubmed.  I have also read all of Michael Mathews books. They are really great, a lot of fitness books are generic and give little information. I am looking forward to his supplement line. Check out his podcast and website too. If you are a beginner this can probably save you a lot of time and money. If you are advanced or intermediate, you can cut your time down in the gym. I'm currently following the thinner, leaner, stronger program and I really like it. He has great recipes, that my 10 year old will eat, and they are easy for people not so skilled in the kitchen like me. Until he puts out a bad book, I will continue to buy his books. If you are male, this and the shredded chef are all you need to make gains. I'm female and I still enjoyed this book.

There are a few reasons for this: the lyrics are abstract enough to not feel tied to the 80s, the production is pristine and the songs still sound good the hundredth time you hear them.<br /><br />Some albums I listen to repeatedly to discover new elements I may have missed. Gentlemen Take Polaroids is not that: there are layers here, but they served themselves up to me the first time in a direct and clear way. The reason I keep playing this album is because I want to return to the groove and atmosphere it creates.<br /><br />This atmosphere is mostly synth, backed by some energetic, remarkably crisp and clear drums. Guitar is so minimal that you might not even realize it is there, which is to say, it blends in seamlessly instead of attacking (Rob Dean needs more respect!). Rounding out the sound is some excellent fretless bass, with an infectious tone, delivered by the late, great, Mick Karn. Vocals are baritone, and delivered in a kind of relaxed drone by David Sylvian. Also, Ryuichi Sakamoto is in the mix, if you're into his whole thing.<br /><br />Despite my love for this album, it isn't for everybody. It has a deliberate pace, and is bound to bore and annoy some types of music fans. If you are a fan of (early 80s) New Wave and Synthpop from the UK, you owe it to yourself to check it out. If you are expecting a pop singles compilation, however, you will be bored.<br /><br />Me, personally? This is an all-time favorite, and I try to play it for everyone.
