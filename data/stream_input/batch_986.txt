0141301139|5.0|I read this book as a child and have recently read it again some 20 years later and I have never realized the subversive themes implied in the text.  Roald Dahl often wrote disgusting and morbid stories to get his readers to wince at the descriptions, Fantastic Mr. Fox is surprisingly light on the disgusting after the third chapter. Instead Dahl invents a hero who steals from the \\"rich\\" \\"crooks\\" of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean. He ends his great adventure with a large feast where he shares his food with all of the other ecological refugees caused by the insatiable rage of the farmers.    The major theme of the work, as it appears obvious to me, is that socialism is good and capitalism is inherently bad.  I know other apologists of capitalism will say I am reading too much into it.  I would say they aren't reading enough into it, which is OK.   The capitalists are all ill-formed rich farmers who have perverted appetites and lack all sorts of moderation.    If, as a parent, you wish to raise your child with the idea that taking from the haves and sharing with the have-nots is a good thing, then I highly recommend this book.  Fox is a fantastic model of sharing and values.  This little book offers a lot to a young reader, especially a good story.  But I don't think they will understand the themes until later.

B001QOGYBI|4.0|This short animation movie was highly recommended by my teenage daughter who saw it with her friends in the theater when it first came out.  I agree.  It's a cute movie with chuck full of very talented actors' voice over.  The storyline was very easy to follow, but the artwork wasn't visually appealing to me.  Everything was painted in monochrome color of ochre, the color of fox.  Nothing stood out.  I'm glad I saw it, nonetheless.  I think even the little children will find it entertaining.  Good movie to watch for the entire family.
0743289692|4.0|A friend recommended this book. I found the book fascinating from the beginning.  We seem to hear about places like Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya only in the framework of a natural or political disaster. A memoir such as Ayann Hirsi Alis offers rare insights into life in these places.    The Muslim culture fascinates me and Ayann Hirsi Ali's memoir offers eye-opening insights to the darker aspects of Islam as preached by Mohammed. This is an important book for those who may desire to take a more liberal view of Islam and downplay the oppression of woman. Ayann makes it clear that the oppression of women and there relegation to inferior status is an integral part of Mohammad's teachings and is still espoused by many strict Muslims.    Finally, Ayann demonstrates through her memoirs how an individual with fortitude and perseverance can overcome extreme cultural and physical barriers.
B002WCLG3O|3.0|Please note that this is a collection of animated shorts, akin to what the Animatrix DVD is to The Matrix Saga.<br /><br />Overall, the production value of each short is excellent.  About half (Origins I+II, Homecoming, The Duel) of the shorts were more lore/canon-heavy than I preferred.  The other four shorts were more what I expected (animated alien-shooting action).<br /><br />I'm glad I NetFlix'd this as I didn't really care for half of the content.  If you're really into Halo lore, you might enjoy it more.  I would recommend reading more of the reviews that describe the individual shorts in detail.  Again, as far as animation quality, I was not disappointed.  The stories were just not to my subjective taste.

B000IMUYJM|5.0|I have no words for this film...well, maybe just a few...This film further supports my theory that some of the best horror movies come from the 70s...but aside from that, Black Christmas was better than anything I have seen lately. Who knew that such an old movie would be refreshing?<br /><br />  If you are a gore-hound..this is probably not for you. However, if you are interested in good acting and a good plot, then this is perfect! This movie does what a lot of horror films from today don't do; it actually tells a story and allows the viewer to get to know the characters..instead of the typical 4 high school or college student gore porn. There was no nudity..which would not be if this movie were made today (especially since it was in a sorority house). I appreciated that it felt like a real sorority house...like real college girls...not a bunch of porn stars bending over into the camera every two seconds...<br /><br />  Another great thing about this movie is that you never see the killer! Maybe an eye here...or hands...or shadow..but never his face, which is even more terrifying because you don't know what you're dealing with...you have to use your imagination...The closing credits, to me, were so haunting..all you could hear was the ringing of the telephone..which, after this movie...will make your spine tingle! True horror fans should definitely see this movie...and if this movie doesn't make your skin crawl...it's on too tight!

1416572287|3.0|O for cute.  A talking dog.  And a patient physics teacher.    I'll bet somewhere there is someone--a rabid dog lover, perhaps (that didn't come out exactly right, but you know what I mean...an OBSESSED dog lover) for whom this book would be perfect.  Fans of the pun might also enjoy the various ways that canine allusions can be applied to physics and vice versa.  And those folks will get the foamy dollop of adorable they crave, and a heaping dose of pretty good pedagogy in the mix.  And they will be happy and better informed, and more power to them.    That's not me.  I found myself growing impatient with the dog BS and just wished the author--who is clearly highly capable of doing so--would just have written and straight-up, gimmick-free book on the fascinating world of physics.    I know every book needs some sort of hook, something to distinguish it from the \\"XYZ for Dummies\\" and \\"Politically Correct Guide to XYZ\\" and \\"Keep XYZ Simple Stupid\\" books that proliferate on bookshelves.  I sympathize.  But surely the way to do that can't be to grow ever more precious and adorable and fun-loving in our approach.  Can it?  I think this might represent some kind of nadir in the level of physics books I'm willing to read.  To make matters no better (if not any worse), I don't think I learned anything new from \\"How to Teach\\" than I already knew from significantly less infantilized and insufferable basic physics books.    Having insulted this probably sincere effort (a book like this is too much work and the payoff too slim for the author to have undertaken it for base reasons), it no doubt will find an audience and for all I know, do a universe of good.  This is perhaps the perfect way to introduce physics to one particular audience.  But if you have any kind of problem with high blood sugar, I can't recommend \\"How to Teach.\\"
B000KD5H00|5.0|It was great rereading this book.  It originally came out in 1965 and several awards and Hugos later still has a lot to say about religious fanaticism, ecology & environmentalism, monopolies and government corruption.<br /><br />Not to give away the whole plot, but the book starts out rather innocently enough:  Paul Atreides was the boy that should not have been.  The Duke's consort, Jessica, was supposed to have a girl.  Right there we have a reversal of traditional roles, which was fairly daring writing in 1965.<br /><br />The Bene Gesseret is the school of mental and physical training for female students, after the destruction of machines and robots many years ago.  Paul is a guy though, yet he is looked upon by the natives of the planet Arrakis as their next savior.  He plays on that and develops it, especially when their family enemy, the Baron Harkonnen, destroys his father and family.  Will there be revenge?  How will he build his power base?<br /><br />Frank Herbert builds a race and a planetary base that is so realistic and it's as if we were transported to this desert planet, where water is as precious as life; your stillsuit collects your body moisture and often you must drink your own body fluids or die.<br /><br />The main part of the story deals with Spice or Melange, a drug that expands consciousness and is also the a rare substance only found on Arakkis.  The sandworms may hold the key to its manufacture which cannot be synthesized.<br /><br />There have been many books written since Dune, including a major motion picture (which you must read the book first to understand the film) as well as science fiction tributes (Star Wars has a desert planet Tatooine, and you can see a long skeleton on the surface -- a sandworm!).<br /><br />I enjoyed the expressive writing, the glossaries and histories were very extensive, and after 90 generations of breeding, the Bene Gesserit would actually succeed or fail, depending on Paul Atriedes to close the gap between the Fremen and civilization.  Paul though sees the future.  Can he avoid the jihad that he keeps seeing in his future?  Quite a novel!es the future.  Can he avoid the jihad that he keeps seeing in his future?  Quite a novel!

0691142165|1.0|The book starts out reviewing theories various people had on the equities markets.  Not only the Graham-Dodd type theories but every obscure, know-nothing idea out there.  Why?

Sorry, just can't recommend this to anyone.
B0039NJTLQ|3.0|Brothers could have been a very moving story.  For me it fell short, as the story seemed under developed, even though the intended message was clear.  The ending was sudden, and left me feeling a bit cheated.  It is really too bad, as this movie could have been a power house with more elaboration.  For me it was just ok.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|A young couple, Katie and Micah, have been experiencing strange events in their home, but the incidents - bumps in the night, sounds of whipered voices, faucets seeming to turn themselves off and on - are nothing compared to the escalating supernatural events that come after Micah gets it into his head to try and document the phenomena.  He buys a camcorder and a load of film to record events day and night and see just what really goes on in the house when they're asleep.      In Blair Witch-style, the entire movie is seen as a compilation of what the camera captured.  Paranormal Activity comes off feeling very real - the performers are extremely natural, never once seeming like they're acting, and none of the effects Look remotely like special effects.  The characterization is in-depth, and it's the characters that make the whole 'recording' scenario seem so plausible.       Of the two, it's Katie that doesn't think the recording idea is very smart: it's Katie who's experiencing the supernatural happenings more first hand than Micah (although they both hear bumps and creaks in the night - which could be anything - it's her that hears the whispers) and she's the one who's lived through this before, as she's been periodically visited or haunted, apparantly by the same entity, at various points since childhood.  It starts up, continues for a while, then disappears for years at a stretch.  And it's followed her from place to place, so the activity is obviously centered on her, not on a specific house or place.  With Micah, we have one of those rare cases in storytelling where the tale seems to tell us a lot about a character that the character himself doesn't seem to be aware of.  Micah loves Katie, and is trying to help, but I think that in the early stages his state of mind - albeit not consciously - is kind of \\"this can't Really be happening.  We'll find there's some rational explanation or not, but in the end we'll just laugh about it.  But you know, wouldn't itbe kind of cool if there really Was something?\\"  I  don't think that in the early days of his experiments with recording events he's ever able to genuinely perceive this 'haunting' as a threat; therefore he doesn't think he's putting Katie or himself in danger when he takes actions that he's been warned aren't wise, that could provoke the entity and make things worse.       Things do go from bad to worse, and it gets increasingly difficult to think of a 'rational' explanation for the increasing activity.  Katie's strong fears from the start and her inclination that they should just ride it out rather than try to understand it, perhaps indicate an intuitive sense of just how dangerous the entity they're dealing with really is, or perhaps indicate that she's glimpsed more during previous incidents of activity than she's letting on.  She does Not believe they can 'defeat' this being, and thinks that the best thing they can do is ignore it and it will do what it's always done before when ignored: eventually go away.  Micah becomes obsessed with understanding it, and by the time he has to admit that the threat is extremely real, he can't back off.  He seems to think that he'd be letting Katie down if he stopped (even though that's what she wants him to do), or perhaps thinks that he'd be less manly if he were to admit he was on the wrong track.  Again, he doesn't necesarily think these things consciously, and that may go for Katie too, but that's the interpretation I got of their motivations.  And so, even as things get worse, the recording continues, and Micah continues trying to capture evidence on film, alternately trying to communicate with the entity or to try and find ways of directly combatting it.  All of which just seems to be bringing the being on and on closer into our world, and leading to an increasingly scary series of events and a shock ender.       Some will find the movie too slow-moving.  Personally, I liked its pace, I liked how in the first third of the movie most of what we're seeing the camera capture is just ordinary, everyday stuff.  It makes it feel real, lets you know the characters, and makes it more potent when events do progress from just the occasional unexplained noise to more bizarre events.  I think it was extremely well-executed, and is one of the best movies of its kind.  Also recommended: [[ASIN:B0028DRGDQ [Rec]]], [[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]] and [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]].
0307245306|4.0|If you've seen the movie, then you need to read the book.  If you don't have time to read the book, then listen to the audio.  Rick Riordan tells a riviting story of modern day mythology, and a new generation of heros.  Jesse Bernstine does a good job reading.  Great for traveling, or a quite night at home.
B002VECMAO|2.0|With a cast that has such a great history, we were quite disappointed in this movie. The previews showed all the best parts and were unrepresentative of the movie. The comedy was forced and the plot tenuous. So what was this movie all about? Was it supposed to be funny, dramatic, tragic?  We now own it, but I doubt if we will ever watch it again. If you really want to watch this movie, buy a used copy or rent it.

It has a little more Jackson 5 that I might have wanted, but it really does the job when you are looking to get into the groove with some MJ tunes. Definitely recommend if you're looking to reconnect to some of his old music, as well as some of his later, more popular titles. It will make you want to sing and dance like you were when you were growing up. Great compilation of Jackson hits!

6305882592|5.0|Yes, I admit it. This movie is my all-time favorite. And the first time I saw it, it wasn't. On that occasion the auditorium was filled with students who'd seen it before and laughed *before* the funny parts. I was peeved and also somewhat horrified about the idea of such an age-discrepant couple. Fast forward some years, and I saw it again. In silence. Wow!!! The music (nearly all of it by Cat Stevens - available in pieces on [[ASIN:B00004T9VY Tea for the Tillerman]] and [[ASIN:B00009V7TP Footsteps in the Dark: Greatest Hits, Vol. 2]]) is excellent. The casting is perfect. The acting is super. The dialogue is amazing. The timing is spot-on. The settings (Harold's mother's mansion, Maude's house, the church, the therapist's office, the graveyard, etc.) are perfect. And the message of hope springs eternal. (... although if you are religious and take the ending literally, you may be offended ...) This movie never gets old for me. I highly recommend it.

0061876747|1.0|I like William Boyd. Any Human Heart is one of my all time favorites. This one though falls short. The premise is good - what happens to an intelligent person who finds himself in a new life -  a re-invented self capable of surviving on a base, street level. I love the idea. The execution here does not inspire and the ending is just plain boring. The story moves along well enough but for what?
B000VLE3GA|4.0|Led Zeppelin has many compilations, but this one, conveniently timed to coincide with the high profile 2007 reunion, fills the previously empty comprehensive two-disc niche. The first thing to know about any such collection is that Zeppelin is truly an album band; they famously refused to release singles and avoided compilations when active. This makes the recent collection plethora surprising and somewhat unfortunate, but there is certainly a market. Zeppelin has far too many great songs for anything less than a near-complete collection to be comprehensive, and the albums are meant to be heard as a whole; the songs often lose something out of context. However, Mothership is the band's best non-boxed set retrospective. It has nearly all the songs still played ubiquitously on radio, the only major exceptions being \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" and \\"Fool in the Rain.\\" True fans of course know that many of their best works are rarely or never on radio and should applaud the inclusion of \\"Achilles Last Stand,\\" perhaps Zeppelin's masterpiece and the kind of long song that rarely makes collections. However, other non-radio friendly monoliths - \\"Ten Years Gone,\\" \\"The Rain Song,\\" \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" etc. - as well as numerous other excellent cuts (e.g., \\"The Rover\\") are missing. It is also easy to quibble with inclusions; all are excellent, but I believe \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You,\\" \\"D'yer Mak'er,\\" and \\"Houses of the Holy\\" are not among the very best. The bottomline is that Zeppelin's first six albums are essential, and the rest have great merit; getting the first six - and perhaps some or all the rest - costs more, but the investment is very worthwhile. However, very casual fans wanting only the songs they hear on the radio, or anyone looking for a convenient and affordable introduction, could do no better than this.
B00371QQ0M|1.0|If the Lord of the Rings was the pinnacle of how to adapt a book to film successfully, Dune is the antithesis of that effort. I love the original book trilogy. I have read Dune at least ten times in the last 30 years. I would put the book in my top five of all time. This movie gets almost everything wrong. It starts with horrible casting as virtually everyone is a characiture (at best) of their counterparts in the book. It continues with artistic license changed to 'license to kill.' I hardly recognized so many important features in the books with substitutions that were idiotic (The Voice...OMG).<br /><br />In fairness, I have to say that this is an incredibly difficult source to put on film as so much of it takes place in the minds of the characters. But seriously, I would rather wake up with my head sewn into the carpet than have to ever watch this again. Maybe we could have used watching this movie as a substitute for waterboarding...no, I guess not. Waterboarding is more humane.

B0000TLA9G|3.0|Guns `N' Roses is probably the best and most important rock band of the last twenty-five or so years, and their continuing popularity ensures a large Greatest Hits market. This CD's title may be strictly accurate in regard to hit singles, but after Appetite for Destruction, Guns rarely released their best songs as singles; indeed, they often made bizarre choices. This is therefore a very poor and distinctly unrepresentative picture of - certainly not a Best Of, as Greatest Hits usually claim to be. It is fine for extremely casual fans, as the first five cuts plus \\"November Rain\\" are the Guns songs most played on radio; anyone wanting those plus a few more can get them here conveniently and easily. Everyone else, though, is poorly served. First, hits or not, several cuts - \\"Yesterdays\\" especially - are not among the band's best. Second, the inclusion of five covers among fourteen tracks - more than one third of the total - is truly strange. Even stranger is that the last three cuts, as well as four of the last five, are covers. This is particularly exasperating in that many excellent Guns songs are missing. Their \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" is of course a signature essential, and their \\"Live and Let Die\\" is played fairly often on radio and thus should arguably be here, but the rest should have been left off. Two (\\"Ain't It Fun\\" and \\"Since I Don't Have You\\") are from The Spaghetti Incident, a covers album universally considered the band's least good pre-Chinese Democracy effort. The latter is actually quite good, but the former's inclusion is simply inexplicable. Both should probably have been left off for Guns-written songs; at the very least, \\"Since\\" alone should have been included if each album was to be represented. The band's \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" is also one of their lowest moments, a soundtrack entry presumably here only to attract those with all the albums. However, hard-cores will have it anyway, and no one else will care for it. There is indeed nothing previously unreleased or even fancy packaging to attract diehards, meaning only the extremely casual should even consider this. The low price is certainly attractive, but the bottom line is that Appetite is one of the greatest albums ever, and the Use Your Illusions have many superb moments. All three are essential, containing everything of real value here plus far more; they will cost a little more, but the investment is very worthwhile.

0312370849|4.0|Sarah's Key is haunting, suspenseful, and captivating. I'm not exactly a WWII expert so I don't know if parts of it are historically feasible, but it was a wonderful story. I finished the book in about 2 1/2 hours and I just could not put it down. It's a story about remembrance, forgiveness, and coming to terms with things that just aren't pleasant.  While none of us can ever imagine what it was like to actually be there, the writing makes the reader feel Sarah's pain.  I liked that no part of the story is told by Sarah in the first person. That reflects the idea that we will never be inside of her head and can only piece together clues to try to understand.  This is a story that should be talked about.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|This is one of those outstanding achievements in Nature filmmaking; surpassing even the now classic Planet Earth from the BBC, as narrated by David Attenborough, true conservationist and a true legend in the field.    But... and this IS a BIG but... having watched the DISCOVERY CHANNEL version narrated by Oprah Winfrey I felt deflated by her annoying, lifeless and downright boring rendition. It automatically brings the rating DOWN to 3 stars!    First it was Sigourney Weaver; now Oprah? Who are these people that think we are STUPID? I come from Puerto Rico, and my father, a well know artist, historian and Nature enthusiast, instilled in us a sense of wonder and awe in the face of Creation; a sharpness in perception to all that surround us. And NOBODY conveys this the way Attenborough does. If anybody has any doubts, they should check the critical reviews this \\"Oprah version\\" has gathered at the DISCOVERY CHANNEL... it is NOT flattering.    But it gets WORSE!    This so-called Attenborough version is coded in 1080i / 50mhz format, which will NOT, I repeat will NOT play in our Blue-Ray players here on the US!!!! That Amazon does not even address this issue is outrageous. Why are they playing with us? Let them KNOW this: No matter what their marketing ploy is for this series... 90% of those that bought the Planet Earth series will NEVER buy the new LIFE series narrated by Oprah. DEMAND the original Attenborough BBC version... in a format completely compatible to the Blue-Ray players HERE in the US!

B002IITP5I|5.0|An extremely hard to film to categorize.<br />I have to be honest and admit that as a movie is not as great as Nolan's Batman films. But as an all around experience is vast superior.<br />Snyder basically took out sections of the comic book panel by panel and converted them into live action and that is the reason why some people felt that it wasn't complete because Snyder couldn't possibly put everything into the film. Yes he did alter some sections of it but I think they were little compared to the whole scope of the project and ultimately reach the same conclusions as the book.<br /><br />One of my favorite scene in the film is Dr. Manhattan creation, chapter IV on the book. I remember getting chills while reading it on the book and watching it in live action gave it realism that creep the hell out of me. Even the music is a lone church organ sound that haunts you long after he is over talking.<br /><br />The intro is also a work of genius and we have to credit Snyder here because in 10 minutes he was able to encapsulate the whole back story of the Watchmen mythology while interlacing it with real events. Thus setting the stage for the events to come.<br /><br />But what is probably the best thing in the movie is Rorschach,there is absolutely nobody who could have played him better than Jackie Earle Haley. In my book his Rorschach is up there with Ledger's \\"The Joker\\".<br /><br />Chances are you probably be better off reading the comic book first so you can appreciate the film better. I know I did and almost all my friends who didn't found it pointless while the few guys who read it loved the film.<br /><br />Also if at the end of the experience you feel cheated or depressed, its OK it only means you are still human.
0756659841|5.0|Thinking about getting this book?  Three quick questions: (1) is it for a child? (2) do they like stickers? (3) do they LOVE Lego?  Actually, scratch #1 because grown-ups get to have fun too.  But if it's \\"yes\\" to all three, odds are that it'll be a major hit!      The book includes two sets of nice-sized minifigure stickers from many of the popular sets out now...Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Power Miners etc.  One set to peel and stick on the theme pages that are in the book - an activity that kept my 7 year old entertained for the better part of a day - and then the other set to stick wherever else. There are also a bunch of much smaller stickers as a bonus. Good clean fun! My son wanted another copy of the book after he finished...no kidding!
B001FB55I0|5.0|I just seen this movie about 4 days ago. Its a really good movie, and honestly the best out of the Terminator series. Definitly a movie worth buying. SO GET IT LOL.
B001BPJJ1E|1.0|The quality of the movie was poor and the sound was even worse, maybe someday they will allow this movie to be professionaly updated from the original film archives, but until then we will have to deal with this kind of low quality dvd's.
B00328G4V6|1.0|Jimi died long ago. Do you really think that viable recordings of such a legendary hit maker would sit in the \\"vaults\\" until now?    The fact that these recordings have not been released earlier should be proof enough that these recordings are not worthwhile. I would love to have another Jimi album, even just a single. Fact is all his material is already out there. This attempt at creating a post-death \\"new\\" album is pathetic any way you look at it.     If the \\"Hendrix Family\\" really wanted to give the public new material it should be some earlier alternative takes or some of the now out-of-print live albums (preferably digitily cleaned up and remastered). I do believe there is good unreleased material of Jimi in \\"the vaults'. It is not a new album though, rather it is alternative takes and live material of his familiar material. At this point, it is collectors and enthusiasts who are buying Hendrix, they want these types of recordings, not a new 'album; of songs that never where completed.     This cd really shows how out of touch record companies are with their customers. They probably figured that 'historicaly' new albums are more profitable than live or alternative mix albums and thought thet could \\"manufacture\\" a new Hendrix album and get it into the charts via traditional marketing hype. These people couldn't be more wrong in their assumptions.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I loved the movie. Awesome. I didn't care for the 'commentary the musical', but totally worth it!!!    Buy this!
B0015OKWL2|1.0|Sadly, a really bad film with two very talented actors. The negative reviews are right.   The script is probably to blame - a very routine \\"cop film\\" with too many clichés.  If you notice, a fair number of copies of this are for sale for only $ 0.01.  Take a guess why.  One reviewer called it \\"a mess of a film,\\" and hoped that DeNiro and Pacino make a better film   sometime in the future. I'm erasing this one - recorded from TV.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Amazing , can't wait for Evangelion : 2.22 , I have the Japanese DVD copy of the movie But the Blu-ray is something else , a shame it's not in DTS .
0393072231|1.0|Not having a Kindle version is ridiculous but that's not why the book deserves only one star.  I think it's because Lewis sometimes doesn't tell the whole story and in fact leaves out the most important parts of the story.  For example, the agony of Michael Burry's relatively short investment career is described in much better fashion in the book \\"The Greatest Trade Ever\\" by Gregory Zuckerman.  Zuckerman is more honest about what really happened to Burry and doesn't present a stylized version of the facts.
B0029O08WA|5.0|All the music is wonderful.  You go from the Death Cab for Cutie soft pop to England's philharmonic orchestra.  It is awesome.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|The movie was well produced and directed. Amazing cinematography; the theological commentary is insightful and unique. Not for the faith-hearted. One needs to prepare to see this movie as something that will have an effect on your life and thinking about Christ.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Just wanted to say that this is one of my all time favorites,good cast and story   Thanks
B000002IRL|5.0|I have realized recently that there are more thrash albums than I thought that are heavy and aggressive that were released in 1991. This is definately one of them. It's Overkill's 5th album and it has no signs of being a \\"Black Album\\". 1991-1993 were the years of thrash metal bands making a sellout or simplified album, but not Overkill. Besides that they may or may not have ripped off part of Black Sabbath's \\"Zero The Hero\\" in \\"New Machine\\", this is an original, non-generic thrash album. I love this album. \\"Infectious\\" is my favorite on this one. Despite getting rid of Bobby Gustafson and replacing him with two guitarists, the style is kind of a progression from \\"The Years Of Decay\\", probably because Bobby \\"Blitz\\" and D.D. Verni are the main songwriters for Overkill. If you love thrash metal or just plain old good metal, you should definately get this album.
1906694168|5.0|I had to order the UK copy because I just couldn't wait to see what happened to Lisbeth Salander and the people in her orbit.  Book three is the most intricate one of the trilogy, and there is lots of suspense and espionage as the different factions battle it out to the end.  I was a bit let down because I expected the courtroom scenes to be explosive, but this is an intellectual thriller, not a melodrama.  I am sad now because the saga of Lisbeth is over.  It's a shame that the author did not live long enough to see how successful his work has become.  Highly recommended for fans of the series.
B000002IOY|4.0|If Bobby Gustafson wouldn't have ripped off Metallica twice on this album, I would give it 5 stars. I love this album but \\"Who Tends The Fire\\" is Overkill's version of \\"Eye Of The Beholder\\" and \\"E.vil N.ever D.ies\\" has the \\"master, master, where's the dreams that I've been after\\" riff in it, just with a different ending. Even the guitar sound is like \\"Master Of Puppets\\" and \\"...And Justice For All\\" which is fine, but Bobby Gustafson should have been more secure with his songwriting skills instead of ripping of the most popular thrash metal band of all time. Besides that, this album rules. It has great riffs in almost every song, it's original and innovative, and it's not boring. Any thrash metal fan should already have this album.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Here's a cartoon that you can watch over and over and it still makes you laugh.  Cute story, great lines, not dummed down, all around fun.
B000002IV8|4.0|This album makes me wonder what Bobby and D.D. were thinking when they decided to go for this style. It's very much like post-Dio Black Sabbath. Bluesy metal, not very thrashy at all. I still like this album quite a bit though. It has a lot of quality songs on it. I don't like \\"Shades Of Grey\\" very much because that just sounds like a spaced-out druggy song to me and I'm not into that kind of thing. If you're a thrash metal purist then I don't recommend this but if you're into quality metal music then you won't be disappointed. This album makes almost no logical sense in Overkill's discography to me. It doesn't follow the style of \\"Horrorscope\\" at all except in a few spots.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Wow!  Who knew a cartoon could make you cry!  My family and I watched this movie and were surprise at how much it touched our hearts.  I highly recommend this movie.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|Normally i would not buy a t.v. show dvd, but this show is just that good.
078322737X|4.0|I saw this movie when I was a teen and after all these years, it's still a feel good movie.  I highly recommend it.
0767819659|5.0|I had downloaded Madeline from Netflix for my granddaughters and every time they came over they wanted to watch it - so I have no choice but to love the movie.  Netflix yanked it from their Instant Viewing menu so I had to have a copy.  It arrived quickly and in very good shape.
0393072231|1.0|I always thought Michael Lewis was a sharp guy, until I read his commentary about earning $16 (hardcover) instead of $10 (kindle).  He and his publisher will now earn $0 from me. I will read it for FREE at Barnes and Noble. Michael, you should have taken the $10 in marginal revenue instead of delivering a product that your customers don't want. Vote with your money if you want to make a change.
B002VPDOFK|5.0|I love that her style includes many types of songs that don't sound the same through the entire CD. I can turn it on and walk away knowing I will enjoy all the songs on the album.

B001FB55LC|5.0|Brothers goes where many movies fail to these days.  It is one of the few stories not afraid to throw the other sides of war into the spotlight for others to see.  Hollywood has a tendency to ignore the \\"ripple effect\\" of families of soldiers and, while slowly coming to the forefront, it is often lost.<br /><br />Toby Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal play two brothers in this film.  Gyllenhaal is coming out of prison as Maguire is off to war.  Maguire's bird gets shot down and he is presumed dead.  Gyllenhaal steps in to take his brother's spot in their family until the truths start to come to head.<br /><br />The entire cast of this film is brilliantly acted.  The psychological effects of war are strongly portrayed by Maguire and you can feel it.  Gyllenhaal plays very well off everyone, making this a believable tale.<br /><br />This is a powerful, deep movie that deals with the darker side of war.  I highly recommend it.

B000007MVD|4.0|This contains live recordings very well done. There is some, small amounts, of new material. The sound is the Beatles and is very well worth the price. I'd buy it again or send it as a gift.  Ray Anderson  Littleton, CO.
1416914307|3.0|It was OK. There is one twist that I didn't see coming because I just wasn't paying attention closely enough to bother trying to decipher it ahead of time.    If nothing else, this book and the other two books in this series offer several hours of light reading that ought to be entertaining to anyone who enjoys the subject matter. The writing and editing improved with each book, and by the time you get to the end all the loose ends are resolved, which I always appreciate.    Valentine gets what he deserves, Clary & Jace settle their feelings towards one another, and the Clave learns a valuable lesson, straight from the Angel's mouth.
0783240287|5.0|Some reviewers seem to think that this production is suggestive and provocative. HELLO. Have you ever been to a Ballet? They wear tights and all sorts of revealing clothing. DUH. Also the Old Testament story of Joseph includes a seduction. HELLO AGAIN. Read your Bible. The Bible does not say that Christians have to be embarrassingly repressed and ignorant of culture. If you think the costume design here is suggestive you have never been to the Ballet or any real theater. Your lack of culture is definitely showing with those thoughtless remarks.    This is wholesome family theater and good culture. It's also a film with good faith and probably more piety and reverence for Christianity than anyone who is going to criticize it on that kind of level. Judge not, that ye be not judged. In other words:DON'T BE SUCH A MINDLESS PRUDE. It makes Christians sound stupid and hopelessly uneducated and narrow. Which a lot of us certainly are not.      This is a great production. First class all the way. And yes, some of us Christians do like the Theater and the Ballet and don't get shocked like it's eighteenth century. I mean get real.                                                     James(real 'Alice' fan)
B002VHI8FE|2.0|The first half of the book was very slow since he is detailing 4 or 5 different groups that won't meet up until the second half. The second half the book finally started to get somewhat interesting when all the very separate story lines started to converge. What you should know is that nothing is resolved in this book or even in the second book. This is part of a trilogy where it all finally comes together in the third book.     I gave the two star rating for the whole story over the three books. There were so many tedious battles that didn't add much to the storyline. The characters seemed to change their persona every other page (brave then a coward, even keeled then suddenly erratic). He could have told the entire story in one book and not lost anything. No spoilers here ... but I will say the ending was really lame and extremely contrived and unsatisfying.

No more huge bonuses for their executives at the expense of the people that actually do the work to keep the company running from day to day.<br /><br />We \\"The Middle Class\\" are coming back whether you EVER sell the Blu-ray Edition or not so you might as well take advantage of the situation and increase sales.
0812968255|5.0|\\"Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option:<br />* to accept this event with humility<br />* to treat this person as he should be treated<br />* to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in\\"<br /><br />With these words, Marcus Aurelius succinctly captures the philosophy he shaped his worldview around.  Practical philosophy such as this often gets tagged with the phrase \\"common sense\\" but to me this does a great injustice to both the underlying philosophy and to the clearly intense struggle to live life by such a code.  The ideals that Marcus articulates are perhaps commonly understood, but rarely translated into practice because human nature tends toward the opposite response: to act selfishly, to taint our judgment with thoughts of \\"what if?\\" and \\"why me?\\", and to rail against that or those we believe have caused us insult or harm.  To live as a Stoic--to accept external events as outside of our control, to treat others with justice and fairness and work toward the common good, and to be able to separate objective fact from subjective evaluation--is incredibly difficult.  The fact that Marcus felt the need to write these notes down and often repeat the same themes over and over again to himself gives proof to their difficulty.<br /><br />Marcus can seem a bit cold and a bit pessimistic at times, but I don't think this need be the case.  It is actually a rather liberating message, both specific and demanding of its adherents.  Want true happiness?  Be unselfish in your actions.  Don't deny your emotions or speculations, but do keep them distinct from objective fact.  The things that are done and said to you are only \\"bad\\" if you let them be.  Improve what you can control, accept what you can't.  If you need help putting things in perspective, Marcus reminds us that all is transient: this too shall pass.  More sobering than uplifting, the message is different than your typical modern \\"self-help\\" book.  Yet, it is these differences and the insights they produce that make it a stimulating and rewarding read, especially in these turbulent days at the beginning of the 21st century.  Due to its excellent introduction and general ease of reading, I particularly enjoyed this Hays translation but encourage potential readers to compare several versions to see which fits their needs best.e that make it a stimulating and rewarding read, especially in these turbulent days at the beginning of the 21st century.

0743298039|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment.  I can't believe it's on any list.  It does not compare in any way to the books by the Bronte sisters or any other great novels.  The ending is becomes obvious and the reading is tedious.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|The opening scene in this movie was brilliant and must not be missed.<br />The story is about a Jewish girl who escapes the Germans as they massacre her family.<br />The movie is a fictionalized version of what could have happened had a Jewish army unit had entered France with the sole intent of killing as many Nazis as possible and finally succeeding in ending the war, when they end up blowing up a theater, which is now owned by the Jewish girl who had escaped, in which the entire top leadership of the Third Reich has assembled to watch a propaganda film.<br />The film, although long is laid out in easy chapters like a book. Tarantino uses wonderful and complex dialogue to guide the film. I loved the exchange of words in the first scene between the French farmer and the Nazi officer SS Hans Landa ( Christoph Waltz) .The action is minimal but at times is very gruesome and bloody. The costumes are splendid and the locations are spectacular as well. Brad Pitt plays his part well and is ably supported by all the basterds. Mike Myers is in a tiny role as a British officer and I feel that he was wasted.<br />I felt that the highlights of the film were the opening scene, the shootout at the tavern, and the wonderful just ending. If I were to watch the film in a movie theater it would be to see Christoph Waltz who is simply brilliant as the shrewd, chilling, sinister, opportunist and always on the alert SS officer Hans Landa. I had never seen him perform before but this could easily be the best portrayal of evil in recent times. He alone is the worth the price of the ticket and popcorn and cannot imagine this movie without him in it. I liked the movie and I gave it four stars. 3/28/10
B000U0F7RG|1.0|The set arrived in good condition and is pretty much what I expected.  As other customers said : it is pretty big, and the DVDs are in cardboard pockets.  I liked the episode guide and the book of gilmorisms.    However, disc number 24 (season 4 last 4 episodes) doesn't work.  Apparently Amazon is aware of the problem since some customers received a replacement disc. But, for an unknown reason, I cannot benefit from this replacement disc.   I have been exchanging e-mails with the customer service for 3 days now and I am not any closer to being able to watch the missing episodes.    I am pretty dispointed in my purchase since the reason I buy complete series boxed set is to be able to watch ALL the episodes, and not miss a season ending.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|The Box is based on a short story called \\"Button, Button\\" by Richard Matheson. It starts in 1976 and I do not know whether this year was chosen for a reason. A couple is having some financial problems and they are Cameron Diaz and Eric Bana. Bana is a employee of NASA and has failed the test to enter the program to be an astronaut and Diaz teaches at a small school and receives news that due to financial difficulties the school would not be providing free tuition to faculty members children.  I could not imagine that people having such good jobs would have financial problems but this is a movie.She is also contemplating a very expensive operation to fix her disfigured toes because of a childhood accident. A box arrives at their door one early dawn and it holds a device with a button on top. The next day Frank Langela acting as Arlington Seward, a man with a severe facial disfigurement appears at their door. He gives them instruction that they would win a million dollars, if they pressed the button on the top but the only downside is that someone unknown to them will die. I think the movie was interesting till this point but soon loses steam because it goes nowhere. In short, it gets very complicated and makes the viewer uneasy. It failed to hold my interest because there really is no resolution at the end and there really is no explanation as to why these boxes are being sent to people. The movie had so much potential. I gave it two stars.3/27/10
B002RSDW80|5.0|\\"Julie & Julie\\" is a charming movie that chronicles the lives of two women in two different times. Julia Child (brilliantly portrayed by Meryl Streep) masters the art of French cooking while living in 1950's Paris with her husband, Paul (Stanley Tucci). Julia pours her heart and soul into what will become a best-selling cookbook, but she struggles to get it published. Flash forward to 2002, when Julie Powell (Amy Adams) is inspired to take a break from her bureaucratic job and cook every single recipe in Julia Child's cookbook in just one year. Julie begins to blog about her experience, and it becomes an Internet sensation.<br /><br />This is a charming and entertaining film with splendid performances by all involved. I'm eager to read the book it was based on.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blindside is the story about Michael Oher who now plays for the Baltimore Ravens and how is life was turned around by Leigh Anne Tuohy and her loving family. He was living on the streets before Leigh Anne brought him home and made him a part of her family. Sandra Bullock gives an amazing performance and Tim Mcgraw supports her capably as her husband. Quinton Aaron plays Michael Oher.<br />Blindside is about kindness of strangers and how strangers can truly make a positive impact in someone's life. This is a true story of a football star and you will love it. It may even cause a salty liquid to come out of your eyes There are so many scenes that are worth noting but I enjoyed Michael's essay towards the end of the movie, also the scene when he is set up in the house by Sandra Bullock and many others. This is a feel good inspirational movie and one of the best I have seen this year. So enjoy it. Five stars. 3/28/10

B00003CX5P|2.0|This movie is made for children.  More specifically, it is made to entertain children while simultaneously selling them toys.<br /><br />If you can turn off your brain and are able to find fart jokes and pointless action entertaining, then you may like this drivel.  If, however, you want strong characters with depth and believability, you wont find it here.  Take Anakin's mother as an example.  She lets two male strangers that she has literally just met enter her 8 year old in a deadly competition, then she lets these strangers take the boy away without so much as a choked back tear...yet she is supposed to be a great mother?  It is horrible writing in terms of characterization, just terrible.  Also, you'll probably not want to look to closely at the plot or you might miss it for all the holes.  Another example, you'd think that having a queen along who apparently owes her escorts her life would make raising funds to purchase Anakin's Mother's freedom by said escorts easy peasy.  Nope.  Instead of asking the Queen for a loan, they separate an 8 year old from his mother.  I'm guessing that at Jedi U, they didn't have child development classes.<br /><br />Anyway, if this is what Star Wars is all about, I'm not going to watch the other five movies.  And whenever I learn that somebody I know is a big Star Wars fan, I'm going to assume they also love pro wrestling, farmville, and find farts utterly hilarious.<br /><br />Addendum Aug 2010:  We finally watched the last two and they are substantially better than the first one.  The art is first rate, and the cgi surprisingly engaging.  And the story, while not great, is decent enough not to detract from the eye candy too much.

0393072231|5.0|I've been a fan of Michael Lewis' non-fiction for years now, and \\"The Big Short\\" is a well-told story of the Byzantine world of credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations. He makes it all interesting by balancing the inherent tensions of the underdog outsiders against the gambling everyone was involved in, and through sheer repetition, I think I actually understood what happened by the end of the book (it takes a while to understand, and that's part of the problem -- nobody except a handful of outsiders really understood what was happening, and it took them years of watching to realize it). The book is one of those that you don't want to end, because you know you'll have a hard time finding something nearly as interesting or well written. A superb and timely telling of perhaps the most sordid tale of our times.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Glad that it won the Oscar for best animated movie.  A real lesson on life is contained in this adult movie that kids will enjoy as well.
0143116738|3.0|To one interested and committed to the reform of the U.S. elementary and secondary education system, Dr. Robinson makes some excellent points.  The path through the book to his conclusions is interesting, but meandering and sometimes hard to follow.  His many stories give it life, but continuity is sometimes lost.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|This is a good movie that I enjoy as well.  I did not say that I adore this movie, but I can tolerate watching it with my wife, and she loves it.  So, you can tell that it is mostly for the females out there.  It is a stretch to think that Jack Black could end up with Kate Winslet in real life, but hey, maybe there is hope out there for us guys without the six-pack abs and metro-sexual attitudes.  The fact that all this is supposed to take place in two weeks is stretching the imagination a bit, but movies are supposed to entertain, and this one does.

Life of Pi to me is all about how one boy used his imagination, his beliefs and his intellect as coping mechanisms to get through a horrific part of his life.

Welcome, Amazon! I remember I once had an Apple Newton--I'll never know how Apple recovered from that debacle. Of course we'll find out soon enough when everyone's Kindle becomes everyone's kindling.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Great movie, with a updated take on Sherlock.  I enjoyed it, and I also grew up with the older movies portraying Sherlock H.  Good entertainment value.
B002VECMAE|1.0|Even great actors and comedic actors couldn't make this movie smell better than goat's poo. Well two hours wasted. Pop corn was good. Oh and its attempt at even communicating what Iraq was, and is, didn't. I give the movie a liberal Naa-a-a-aa-ah.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|Blu-ray purchasers should be aware that the Blu-ray/DVD combo is available in 2 different packages: [[ASIN:B0030IIYWA Blu-ray Packaging]] and [[ASIN:B0030IIZ1A DVD Packaging]]. The discs and contents are the same, but if you prefer a certain case, make sure you order the correct one.    I have nothing else to add to the 250+ reviews already here, except to note that the Blu-ray transfer is GORGEOUS: crisp, clean, and perfect. An expert reviewer at the website DVD Beaver has said that out of the 900+ Blu-ray discs he owns, this is the best-looking one.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Funny that a movie's main engine is computer graphics and not the plot or human acting. Even the human acting by the lead characters Chiwetel Ejiofor and John Cusack could pull this cracked movie displacement together. Sorry, I bought it but not the Poseidon Adventure plot.
1416960953|5.0|I bought this book for my 5yr old who is simply obsessed with anything Spiderwick. What a delight it was and still is to see him interact with this book. It has been 7 weeks now and he still loves it, and goes to bed with it every night.  Now if only there was a version with real leather straps around it and some real wax seal, it would be his ultimate wish come true.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Ever since my son was born (18 months ago), I haven't been working out at all. I lost all my baby weight, but I felt like my muscles were totally out of shape, especially my abs. I also felt like I needed more energy to keep up with my very active toddler. I had worked out with DVDs at home before, so I wanted to get something to whip me back in shape. After some research, I decided to try the 30 Day Shred. It seemed to offer exactly what I needed - an intense workout in a short period of time. I can easily do this workout while my toddler is napping, and still have time to do other things while he sleeps. At the same time, I feel like I really worked out hard. In the beginning, I had to take lots of breaks, even though Jillian tells you to keep going. Since I haven't worked out in such a long time, I wanted to give my body a chance to adjust. The more you do the workout, the less breaks you will have to take. Just listen to your body and do as much as you can, but keep pushing yourself.  Here are some pros and cons:    Pros:  - Short (about 25 min. total) but intense workout that can fit in even the busiest schedule  - I like Jillian's no-nonsense instructions. She gets straight to the point.  - Modifications to each exercise are given for beginners.  - The circuit style workout really maximizes the calorie burn.    Cons:  - The music isn't much to brag about. However, I'm so focused on the workout anyway, I didn't even pay much attention to the music.  - This workout is hard on the knees and ankles, so watch your form while exercising.    Some advice:  - For the ladies: Wear a really good bra, for there is a lot of jumping involved.  - For that same reason, wear good gym shoes that support your ankles. My feet were killing me the first time I did this workout. My ankles were on fire.     For variety, I'm going to try Jillian's \\"No more trouble zones\\" DVD next.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|Like Shakespeare, Jane Austen's stories never get obsolete. The older versions of the stories have much to recommend them but a fresh new take is always welcome and this new version of Emma is no exception. This rendering takes it time with a longer running time than previous ones and I really enjoyed the expanded story lines. It feels like it breathes more and it answers questions that other versions leave unexplained. The entire cast is quite good and bring their characters to life in a very human way. At first I thought Jonny Lee Miller looked too young to play Mr. Knightly but he is actually about the correct age in real life and does a wonderful job. I also liked Rupert Evans as Frank Churchill. We get to know him better than in previous versions and he brings his awkward situation to life in a way that makes you feel for him even though he doesn't handle it all that well.  The scenery, costumes and music all contribute to make this a marvelous production! Always a good idea to spend some quality time with Jane. :)
B00004VW0V|5.0|Much as with Joni Mitchell during the mid 70's Cat Stevens decided at this point in his career it was time for a musical change. Whereas Joni elected to maintain her basic style of song but integrate the influence of other genres Stevens went out and out here. He completely abandoned his previous style of short, baroque style singer-songwriter pop music here and turns his attention towards focusing the whole first half of this album towards the title suite,which is significantly longer and doesn't depend as heavy on songcraft as it does harmonic and melodic progression. That along with the addition of musicians Bernard Purdie,Phil Upchurch and vocalist Patti Austin properly indicate that Stevens' is coming at his more \\"progressive\\" music here much the same way as Todd Rundgren did:more through the rhythmic foundations of jazz,soul and funk as opposed to the more ornate classical chord progressions that characterized the majority of prog rock and,for that matter Steven's earlier music. The other half of the album features shorter songs but again they are similar in style. The ballad \\"How Many Times\\" for example is a more stripped down piano number with far fewer orchestrations than a usual Cat Stevens ballad and \\"Later\\" is interestingly enough pretty flat out 70's Stax style funk with some very [[ASIN:B000000ZML Shaft]]-like wah wah guitar and a blend of funk and singer-songwriter pop similar (if mildly more edgier than) what Carole King was doing during the same time in America with her underheralded [[ASIN:B0012GN0MQ Fantasy]] album. The lyrical sceme on this song is just as poetic as before however it didn't appear that anyone who listened to this,at least at the time were prepared to hear Cat Steven's create elongated compositions that took time to develop and showcased a lot more music than singing,which in a lot of ways doesn't exactly follow the pop/rock part line even in the more musically open 70's. Still this album is more than worth investigating for those interested in Cat Stevens' artistic progressions during his prime years and more so as an example of how jazz-funk and singer-songwriter pop were coming together at their creative and commercial crossroads.h investigating for those interested in Cat Stevens' artistic progressions during his prime years and more so as an example of how jazz-funk and singer-songwriter pop were coming together at their creative and commercial crossroads.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|The American version of Life is shamefully dumbed down in an attempt to popularize it. It seems to me that Operah is trying to cheaply gain some of the reverence that people like Al Gore received after filming An Inconvenient Truth.

I am getting back to it again and again rereading passages after talking to friends or family members.     The episodic style might not be what some people are looking for. This is not a work of fiction. This is not a novel. But it's definitely what I had been looking for!

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I caught a glimpse of this on Discovery Channel when it was originally aired. And I saw five mins of it and I was hooked.  Really amazing stuff, a lot of footage that was captured I thought it didn't exist in wild life.  One of the best was the feeding frenzy in Alasakan summer of marine animals and also a Himalayan Cat chasing a pray around on steep mountain. And of course who could forget the slow motion footage of Great White attacking a seal.  I could go on and on about this beautifully captured documentary.  I was never a nature show kind of guy before this and I have to say this is a better reality show than American Idol.  Really got to give kudos to BBC and Discovery for producing such an gigantic production documentary.  This is an unbelievable achievement and camera work. Just jaw dropping stuff. Makes you feel closer to Mother Earth like never before.

1400067936|4.0|Nassim Taleb is a professional money manager and mathematics professor.  In this book he examines the nature of chance and the fact that humans inevitably confuse dumb luck with skill, and how our need to put explanations to everything tends to lead us to misinterpret random events as meaningful.  He uses personal anecdotes from his investing experience as well as numerous references to great philosophy and literature through the ages.  There is no practical investing advice in this dense and sometimes difficult book, but if you can get into Taleb's intellectual theories, you probably will not look at the world in quite the same way again.
B0035J6TA8|4.0|First of all, let me say that I was completely uninspired when I first heard about this record.  I love Peter Gabriel's music, and I must confess that I am disappointed that he has not released a \\"proper studio album of original music\\" since 2002's Up.  Also, the idea of cover records has never really enthralled me.  But please note that this is no ordinary cover record.  First of all I have to say that if you do not listen to or have a background in serious classical music than a lot of the brilliance in these arrangements will go over your head.  That isn't to say that you will not enjoy the record, but there is a lot to digest with this record.  At the end of the day I think the record has its moments -- Mirrorball is both a fantastic arrangement that really compliments the lyrics, Boy In The Bubble presents a Paul Simon classic in a new and compelling light, and The Book of Love is the album's one \\"pop-orchestral piece\\" that is both musically satisfying and relatively easy to hum along with.  But be forewarned- this is not a typical Gabriel album.  Approach it with an open mind and accept its few flaws (the second half of the album lacks the orchestral spice contained in the first half) as noble attempts at creative experimentation.  After all, this album does succeed more often than it fails.  Also, it is certainly well worth a listen to any music fan (familiar with Gabriel's work or not) who enjoys the blurring of the line between what is considered \\"pop\\" and \\"classical\\".
0307454541|4.0|Pierced, tattooed, twenty-four-year-old, Lilliputian-sized Lisbeth Salander is, according to her boss, (p 30) \\"beyond doubt the most able investigator he ha[s] met in all his years in the business.\\" She is also innately vengeful, mistrustive, and, from a reader's standpoint, an unlikely though extremely likeable heroine. And this book featuring her as its title has a lot going for it. The plot is convolutedly difficult to sort out and the story is filled with Swedish societal norms that are, in many ways, significantly different than their American counterparts. The development of the many characters contained in the story is excellent and their personalities range from charismatic to corrupt to utterly despicable.<br /><br />The story, set in Sweden in late 2002 through most of the following year, is this: a wealthy, elderly man named Henrik Vanger receives a rare, framed flower, as he has every year for the past 36, ever since the disappearance of his beloved 16-year-old niece, Harriet. Mr. Vanger soon hires a forty-two-year-old journalist (who's recently been sentenced to jail time for libel and defamation for an article he wrote) named Mikael Blomkvist to investigate the case under the guise of chronicling the Vanger family history. Helping with the case is Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, who is force to deal with dirty rotten scoundrels in both her personal and professional life. Although there are some marginally hokey moments (involving certain clues figured out in Chapter 16), some seriously sickening sex scenes, and an above-American-average level of promiscuity, the Girl, Ms. Salander, steals the \\"show\\" with her mad sleuthing skills and danger-defying daring. Also good: The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins, The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks, and Green River Running Red by Ann Rule.
0385523904|5.0|A poignant, horrific and illuminating book covering the experiences of North Koreans from the end of World War II and the Korean War to the present day. Demick weaves the stories of six defectors to paint a picture of the deterioration of North Korea's economy through those years and an idea of what a typical life looked like for a North Korean during that difficult time. \\"Nothing to Envy\\" offers a brief overview of how North and South Korea became divided, and changes in North Korea from the institution of its first dictator. Despite the socialist idea for the society, the new country operated largely still in a certain caste system, essentially creating inequality for the people. The lives of many, particularly mothers, proved inspiring as they went to great lengths to ensure their families were fed, even amidst constant death. People carried on despite growing skepticism towards their own government and the atrocious circumstances.     The book is a good study of North Korea, if only from the stories of a few. From a sociological point of view, it provides interesting insights into the workings of a failed attempt at communism, as well as the idea that though many are blinded by ignorance caused by psychological brainwashing, others, such as children, are oftentimes skeptical about the lack of justice they see in their day to day lives. Though heart-wrenching and nauseating at times, I couldn't put this book down. Highly recommended.

B0035G9ABQ|5.0|When Damon and company started Gorillaz back in 2001 with their debut album I thought that the whole project was just a little escape from Albarn's of all his wishes to come up with an electronic/rap/hiphop record kind of thing. And it was unconceiveable to think that he would have come up with a song like \\"Clint Eastwood\\" on a Blur's record. I must say that the first two albums have great tracks and the most of the singles they went it were the right ones to promote on the radio but that was it. I had never taken a Gorillaz album \\"that seriously\\" 'cause to me it was just a side project to what Albarn is used to do. Now, \\"Plastic beach\\" makes the exception here.<br /><br />This is an album that was produced with such care and attention that you can hear it in every track and it must be said that ALL of the tracks are diffrent between each other in one way or another. Personally, \\"Stylo\\" must be the plainest track of all, there's no much enthusiasm in this one and yet, you get caught by it in a second. On the other hand songs like \\"Rhinestone eyes\\", \\"Empire ants\\" and \\"Some kind of monster\\" (featuring Mr. Lou Reed) could be the best tracks in the album following the idea of a pop side of this record. The hio hip/rap ones are good too and here I must confess that I¨M NOT a fan of this genre at all but Gorillaz has approach this kind of music to me so smoothly that I have to give them the credit of it. \\"Superfast jellyfish\\" is very fun to liten to and \\"Welcome to the world of the plastic beach\\" is an elegant tune. \\"Sweepstakes\\" on the other hand is too oevrloaded with sounds and vocals that it just didn't make it to me. And here it is, the song that I LOVE I would've come up with with my project NUEVE but apparently Albarn took away this tune from my perception. \\"On melancholly hill\\" is just a great, great track. So simple, so beautiful and so 80's too. Again, I really envy the fact that Damon Albarn came up with this track and not me (not that I'm comparing myself with Albarn at all). Hats off to this guy and to all the things he has done with Blur, The good, the bad and the queen and now Gorillaz.at all).

B000OLUCUI|5.0|I used this book as required reading in a seminar for senior math majors.  I asked them to write up their own Amazon review of the book and here is a summary of what they said:    The class unanimously thought that the book was extremely readable.  They appreciated that Singh structured the book so that there was an actual story arc with building tension.  In order to appreciate Wiles' accomplishment, Singh take the reader on a journey through history as it relates to the development of math.  None of the math presented was of a complexity that would turn off the non-mathmatician.  They all stated that they would recommend this book to anyone regardless of their mathematical sophistication.  One student was disappointed that there wasn't more insight into the character and structure of Wile's proof, however.      I think the most positive comment that I can make as an instructor is that a few (out of a class of only 7) finished reading the book with weeks to spare simply because they couldn't put it down.  These are second semester seniors, people.  Obviously this is a well written, engaging book.

It borrowed (and borrowed poorly) from almost every other thriller book and movie ever made.  The charaters are about as flat as my 10 yr old niece's chest.         Oh, and I swear to God that the word CHUCKLE is used on almost every page! I'm not kidding people. Chuckle,Chuckle...everywhere and not another laugh I think.       The ending was a complete let down, and did not anyone NOT figure out the identity of the bad guy, I mean could Dan Brown possibley give you any more any clues? I don't think so. Arrrgh!         What really pisses me off is that I finished it thinking that it would have to get better, but alas no. Woe is me. The writing seemed to degernerate down into a swirling mass of cliches and stupid religious dogma.     Do not waste money on this book. As a matter of fact just leave Dan Brown off of your reading list, period.                      2

1416562605|4.0|It's interesting that Adiga has written a review on Ralph Ellison's \\"Invisible Man\\" because in many ways White Tiger feels like some of the thoughts and ideas of Invisible Man applied to an ironic Indian \\"entrepreneur.\\" It's a first person account (in this case written to a Chinese Minister) of how the White Tiger became an entrepreneur. Invisible Man wrestles with issues of race and politics in postwar Black America and ends up with an angry intellectual in a hyperilluminated basement room. This book ends (and I'm not giving anything away here) with a confident entrepreneur in a chandelier illuminated apartment that represents some kind of empowerment. The main character in White Tiger is similarly undefined in name, going by no name and then \\"Munna\\" (which means boy) until he comes up with a later name. He is born into a low caste family but has a strong desire to escape the lack of options and possibilities for someone of his caste. His family pays someone to teach him how to drive and he fortunately finds himself a driver who is eventually chosen to accompany a westernized son of a coal magnate to Delhi. To gain his utter freedom he chooses to murder his master and the book focuses on motivating why he chooses to murder his master, whom he clearly respects and put us as readers in his morally ambiguous shoes. Despite the heavyhanded foreshadowing by the narrator, the book is laugh out loud funny at times and we believe his account of an India whose lower classes are held in a \\"Rooster Coop\\".<br /><br />Ultimately, I found the main character to be heroic despite the sometimes morally bankrupt nature of his decisions. He's clever. He learns. He understands the vice he is in and he is willing to do anything to overcome it. If we buy into his view, that a caste driven India dooms him to break coal for the rich, we understand better how he is willing to sacrifice family and values to build a better life for himself and gain the necessary freedoms to be an \\"entrepreneur\\".<br /><br />As a story and as a plausible work, this book really works for me. I'm not sure it's Booker Prize worthy because I don't think this book rocks the foundations of literature. It does, however, introduce you to a particular character in India and make you see his world and wrestle with his feelings and choices. Those who know India better may be better qualified to question how believable this is and whether the westernizing influences and form of the novel compromise an authentically Indian voice.<br /><br />I dug it and I give it 4.5 stars.<br /><br />--SDAs a story and as a plausible work, this book really works for me.

B000006TRV|5.0|Not exactly sure which release date my cd is, but I had no problems with the sound quality...there are versions of this which are listed as being remastered, but that was done years ago, apparently. Will limit this review to just the songs that I think are particularly noteworthy...or remind me of other songs. Anyway, this is the first album described as a concept album where I can actually see that the label is meaningful and not just a woolly term applied more in hope than certainty. As you listen to this double cd album, you'll realise that it is thematically coherent and the songs relate to the unfolding story (that second listen had me pick up on the trajectory of the album's central character...the album gives you their conception and points to their death). It comes across as filmic in quality, with ambient soundbites which paint a picture of an artist in decline...physical and mental. These moments are like scenes in a  movie. Subsequent listens reinforce this perception and make it even clearer. Recently watched a docu which made me realise that perhaps the concept behind this album was even clearer when viewed in concert. That docu might have been \\"Which one's Pink?\\", or the multi-episode docu series on the history of rock music, by the BBC...\\"Seven ages of rock\\". The episode this album featured (if it did) would have been the one concerning stadium rock.  In any case, my point is that watching the album performed in concert would create the necessary imagery to grasp the nature of the story contained in the work. The album did that well enough, in my view, but watching the docu made me realise I was missing elements which would have made the album clearer in intent.        The Classics:        The happiest days - like a lot of tracks on this album, it features a cool transition to it from the previous song. You hear a helicopter, then the musical theme of the following track is established. Great vocal theatre in the song. A brilliant, operatic score. Drums are interesting at the end. More themes and motifs of the following track are introduced.     Another brick in the wall (part 2) - another brilliant transition to this song. Great lyrics, cool guitar and especially bass guitar work at the start. The guitar solo at the end of this song is my pick as the greatest guitar solo of all time. The children's choir in the middle is also really cool. An all time great song.    Comfortably numb - makes use of the preceding song's lyrics. Bassy, synth, cool vocal theatre. Has beautiful, swirling violin type sounds. The lyrics are excellent. Not sure if this is the first song that deliberately includes extraneous human noises...you hear the singer clear his throat at the start. Maybe Jimi Hendrix did this kind of stuff too...just don't remember. In one Hendrix song you could hear him chewing gum, but I don't think that that was intentional, like it was in other songs of his.    Run like Hell - yet another really cool intro, with the riff and beat. Sounds like Gilmour is rubbing the guitar strings initially, for effect. This track should have been on their best of \\"Echoes\\". The riff is good and open.           Best of the rest:      Outside the wall - pleasant, mellow, genteel music and singing. Piano accordion and children's choir feature.          Best of the rest (on second listen):        The thin ice - opens with a baby crying. Synthy track with a slow tempo. Piano tinkling, gets a bit rock with the lead guitar style.    Another brick in the wall (part 1) - very nice note picking on the guitar...delicate and a little ethereal. Synthesiser plays musical motifs that we know from Brick part 2.         and...      Mother - starts with an exhalation, as if to summon the strength to sing the song. About the unhealthy relationship with the central character's mum. Acoustic guitar, organ and bassy sound feature.          By the by...        In the flesh - has Black Sabbath open riffs type rock. Starts with the harmonica thengets Gothic.  Veers to more 'normal' type rock, with a good tone to the drums, and some 1950s style backing vocals.    Goodbye blue sky - nice acoustic guitar part which reminds me of Metallica's immortal song \\"Fade to black\\" (the part before their killer riff kicks in).  Pleasant vibe to this track.     Empty spaces - an instrumental to start with, then you hear voices (backwards), then the lyrics start.    Young lust - riff a little bit \\"Walk this way\\", by Aerosmith. Funky. Rock song with a very bassy sound. Keyboard. A key part of the thematic progress of this album.    One of my tunes - arty, like a movie scene. Then it gets a bit psychotic rock.     Hey you - guitar has a \\"Sounds of silence\\" vibe to it (Simon & Garfunkel song). Delicate electric guitar and bass. Slow tempo.    War - wistful lyrics of Vera Lynne (famous English singer during World War II). Organ, acoustic guitar, some orchestral arrangement.    Bring the boys back home - rousing orchestra, choir, military style drumming, overwrought male vocals.    The show must go on - 1950s style harmonies (barber shop quartet territory) as well as Beatles style harmonies.    In the flesh - Beach Boys type harmonies and vocals, 1950s style bass. Starts off as a rock instrumental with open riffs, then going on to bigoted lyrics (part of the concept).    Waiting for the worms - 1950s style surf harmonies. Some German World War II references, bigoted lyrics, piano,  bassy, interesting drums. The megaphone voice sounds like that used in the all time Australian psychedelic classic \\"The real thing\\", by Russell Morris.     The trial - has sort of a \\"Baby elephant walk\\" vibe to it, with the symphony. Then gets very English musical theatre type stuff. Later there's some rock guitar and someone who sounds like John Cleese doing a school master type voice.          Recommendations (concept albums):        Genesis - From Genesis to Revelation. A pleasant listen. A discernable concept to be found...not as coherent as TheWall though, it seems to me.    Frank Zappa & The Mothers Of Invention -  Freak out! A pleasant listen. Can't really discern any concept behind this album. Occasionally challenging to listen to, if you only like pleasant music. Gets whimsical and jazzy at times.    King Crimson - In the court of the Crimson King. A pleasant listen, for the most  (apart from the more raucous opening track). Title track is a beautiful classic. Not sure what the concept is here either!    The Beatles - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Over-rated, so don't go in expecting a masterpiece. \\"A day in the life\\" is a bona fide masterpiece though. A very slight concept to this album...which has been overblown, in my opinion.  Some Beatles say as much themselves.
0802473156|1.0|Got as far as the end of the first chapter and could not read further . . . recommended by my therapist; still giving him grief for the recommendation.
B002VH7P4O|3.0|First off, I don't own this item but I have heard the music contained within. Yes, the 24-bit files sound good, but why were they sampled at only 44.1khz? Why not do a 24/192 or at least 24/96?     Secondly, the Apple idea is really cute but how about some media that is easily played through a stereo system that isn't \\"computer-ready\\"? Some of us aren't tethered to a PC or a Mac. I don't understand why EMI didn't issue all of the Beatles' material in DVD-A or SACD format (while those formats were still a going concern). Now we have sort of hi-rez files being sold in an aluminum (or is that aluminium?) apple with a usb stick inside. I don't get it.
0151013047|4.0|Two people eating a meal in Lahore, a large city in Pakistan.  We only hear one of them speak, Changez, the title character himself.  As for his compatriot, a mysterious American, we only catch clues of what he says or does by Changez's responses to him.  That is all that really takes place in THE RELUCTANT FUNDAMENTALIST.  Despite this sparse outline, the book is captivating.    The great appeal of THE RELUCTANT FUNDAMENTALIST is its absolutely stunning prose.  The dialogue and descriptions are simple and direct, yet capture the beauty of the English language in a manner not easily matched by even better known authors.  For those interested in a book demonstrating absolute command of language but lacking in the pretentiousness of too many modern novels, this would be an excellent choice.    Changez takes us back in time with him, when he arrives in America and gets along relatively well for such an outsider.  First Princeton, then a challenging job at a prestigious valuation firm in New York City, and maybe, just maybe, a beautiful girl as well.  He seems to be taking the first solid steps to the good life, particularly important to Changez as his family back in Pakistan, once quite prominent, has seen its own prestige fall further into the past.      But like a painfully tiny imperfection that appears in a once flawless diamond, which mars the entire stone and cannot be ignored by those who see it, a slight crack appears in Changez's  perception of the world, his adopted country, and himself.  The book is so well written that, when the crack appears, we instantly recognize it as small yet also realize that it will consume the whole.  Just give it time.    The plot starts strong but loses some steam in the second half.  Changez's perceptions of anti-Muslim sentiment post-9/11 are probably more true than many Westerners want to believe, but also probably less true than is actually the case.  I cannot say whether the author purposefully failed to have Changez explorethis possibility within himself.    Further, although I do not mind ambiguous endings, the one here is a bit much.  Even for the unknown, most people will want a bit more to sink their teeth into simply to speculate as to who certain people are and exactly what is going on.  Again, however, the prose keeps the reader's attention and I would not discourage someone from reading THE RELUCTANT FUNDAMENTALIST based on a few weaknesses in an otherwise strong text.  Mohsin Hamid is an author to watch.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|love watching this show, like the x-files before they started to be not so great. the price was really good to way better then any were I've seen, one of the good new si-fi shows on tv
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Despite all of the \\"criticism\\" behind his personal actions in recent months, this is another great album by John Mayer.  Beautiful and emotional songs that will grab your attention with his smooth sound and poetic lyrics.
B0017KIBAI|4.0|Much has been said about this controller already, but I noticed no one really says much about its use on the Wii.  Note that this controller must be directly plugged into the Wii console, not the remote.  Its cord is very long, so it's not too much of a drawback.    Also, the remote doesn't substitute for the Wii remotes.  In other words, on the Wii main screen, you can't move the cursor around with this remote.  Other than that, this remote works great.  A lot of wii games don't support a rumble pack, so you won't get that feature anyway.
159562015X|5.0|We have used the StrenthsFinder 2.0 book in the last three sessions of our in-house Leadership Training (L.E.A.D.) and plan to use it again in the Spring Session. The test that goes along with the book is a great tool for our participants. We discuss the findings during the Leadership session and they even get to keep the book! We always get positive feedback on the books!
B001C4CI8U|4.0|A whole different type of series remenisent of X-Files.  I love Sci-fi and those added type of story lines.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love Supernatural ( all seasons). I wait and watch every week. I now have all the seasons (1-4) out and can't wait to watch them again from the beginning!
0307473473|5.0|Well written and clever story, especially the character development.  Now fully engaged in the second book, The Girl Who Played with Fire.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|So not only is this band hilarious, but they are truly talented.  Being a parody band is one thing, but making raunchy songs that are so catchy you find yourself humming them on any given day is genius in itself.  I think some people need to lighten up and not take it so seriously.  Sit back and enjoy and if you are offended, don't listen to it.  That being said, Steel Panther rocks!!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This copy was a Gift for someone else - but I have seen it and it is one of those Films Everyone should see! It would be great for Educational purposes too.   :0)
B002RVZV9K|5.0|A nice intimate look at these 3 very influential musicians and fans of each other.  Very different than most documentary type features.  Lots of insights into what inspired these 3 icons to get into their particular styles of playing.  Some of my favorite tidbits were Jack Black's building a very simple electric slide guitar with his main tool being a hammer, The Edge's description of the conditions in Ireland when U2 was forming, and Jimmy Page's tour of the location they recorded the drum track of 'When the Levee Breaks'.  The film makers' commentary audio option is excellent and adds alot to the enjoyment of a second of many viewing > great stuff for would-be documentarians.  Highly recommended!
044024238X|5.0|I just want to premise this review by saying that THIS book was given to me by a friend simply because she finished it and thought i might like it... never mind that I hated reading, never read, and probably wouldn't read it. I had found out that shopaholic was being turned into a movie, and since i HAD that book as well, i read it and fell in love. then i remembered i had THIS book... and didnt even realize it was the same author... and thus beginning my obsession with chick-lit novels, catapulting me into a sort of bookworm escapism type of person. thank YOU, sophie kinsella!<br /><br />Samantha is an uptight lawyer who makes an EPIC mistake and somehow finds herself running away from her old life. ANd by accident starts a new life as a housekeeper. Ahh... i don't want to give away too much without spoiling all the little fun things that i enjoyed discovering as i read this book.<br /><br />i adore EVERYTHING about this book. like i said, this book is was what made me start to read and realize that novels CAN be entertaining and fun! (i really hated reading. i cannot stress that enough) I loved the humor, the plot, and the characters. i LOVE how kinsella was able to bring these characters to life. I really felt for Sam and could not wait to find out what would happen next. THere was just something about the storyline that kind of gave me a guilty pleasure/vindication kind of feeling. like HAH! take that! and yes.. nathan is definitely a swoon-worthy character. more of him pleeeaseeee!<br />Okay, and yes, i kind of understand why some people would hate this book. it does somewhat feel like it's bashing overworked lawyers, but so what? i really feel like it could be broadened to any professional woman that's too into her job. Kinsella does a fabulous job of portraying a what-if scenario for you.<br /><br />ooh but i love it all. if you love chick-lit, please promise me that you'll read this one! okay, thanks!
B0002XH9Z4|3.0|I buy this for a gift, my girlfriend is a Michael Jackson's fan, i make this gift on his birtday.She told me that the CD is spectacular because it has the best songs and songs for her unknown
B003954I9C|5.0|After at least 6 years of saying he's going to release a solo he's finally done it and guess what it's pretty good. He's written most of the songs if not all and even wrote some with JC Chasez, he's even produced it himself..good for you AJ.     Theres not one song on the cd that I don't like but my favorites are Sincerly and London both beautifully written and arranged.     Worth buying you all.
1558216847|5.0|Book arrived faster than expected and was in brand new condition. I would highly recommended this book, amazing and interesting story.  First book to really catch my attention in months.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Loved this movie, I watched it again & again & again. I hope they continue this sequence like they did the original.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I was a little surprised that this film didn't focus more on the actual conditions of our factory farms; but then I imagine it's getting ever more difficult for outsiders to get inside these facilities.  What did surprise me was the degree of ruthlessness exhibited by one company in particular - Monsanto.  I realize that companies in general play \\"hard-ball\\" when it comes to their business practices; but this company has taken that concept to a new high in attempting to corner the soybean market - which it already has about 95% of anyway! It summarily sues any farmer who hasn't bought its genetically altered seeds if any trace of those seeds show up anywhere in that farmer's crop. And, given the nature of the crop pollination process, it's virtually impossible for some of those seeds not to show up in just about every farmer's crop.  Monsanto simply sends its army of lawyers out to shut the independent farmer down - something which, needless to say, the farmer cannot return since, even if some of his seeds show up in the genetically altered crops, he cannot afford such a legal juggernaut.  Another interesting aside concerns one of our Supreme Court Justices, who had once been a Monsanto attorney - and who, instead of recusing himself when a case concerning Monsanto came before the Court, actually wrote the majority opinion!  All in all, this film is as much about business practices as it is about food itself.
B0011WMHRK|4.0|If Tangerine Dream patrolled the deep, yawning vistas of outer space, then surely Can explored the perhaps even more vast terrain of inner space. And Tago Mago is the summa musicologica of inner space rock. Tago Mago features Michael Karoli's acid rock attack guitar, Damo Suzuki's incomprehensible alien mantras, Irmin Schmidt's impressionistic electronic backdrops, Jaki Leibezeit's relentlessly funky drumming and Holger Czukay's hypnotic bass and innovative tape loops. The delightfully airy first part of \\"Paperhouse\\" is about as straight-forward a song as you'll ever hear Can do. Damo's psychotic mumblings are finally at least half-intelligible, and there's nothing overbearingly strange or experimental about \\"Paperhouse\\" except for perhaps the abrupt shift to a lethal groove in the second half of the song. But then the trip inward begins. \\"Mushroom\\" is as trippy a song as you'll ever hear the Dead or the Airplane do and then there's the monolithic groove of \\"Halleluhwah,\\" which ushers in Burundi drumming a decade ahead of Peter Gabriel and two decades ahead of Drum'n'Bass in the early 90's. It's a groove as funky as anything Motown ever did, with Czukay and Leibezeit stealing the show with their almost psychokinetic rhythmic rapport. And of course there's Damo's lacerating proto-punk yelling. \\"Aumgn\\" is an utterly alien exploration of musique concrete soundscapes that owes much to Stockhausen with its fractured, jagged structure and tape loop experiments--until, that is, Czukay and Leibezeit propel the piece into a translunar cosmic groove. As with Sgt Peppers or Dark Side of the Moon, Tago Mago got there first.
B0035J6TAI|1.0|I've seen very live Gabriel tour in the States since 1978.  ROXY show was great.     What the heck is this album?  The only track I like is Listening Wind, which I like quite a bit.  Spent 5oo bucks for a pair of hollywood bowl tix. Afraid the evening will be as boring as most of this record.
B000063V8U|5.0|To be completely fair, this was purchased as a gift.  But if you are a Next Gen fan, each season is beautifully packaged and features lots of extras.  Amazon was extremely prompt in shipping and saved the day for us.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|This show completely redeems Showtime in my eyes. The writing is strong, the acting is excellent, and the direction is fabulous. Michael C. Hall is brilliant and he more than deserved the Golden Globe (finally!). If you are someone who enjoys smart shows and serial killers, then run and see this series! It is strong in almost every possible way.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a great family film.<br />I love the way it covers the topic of kami, it's very unique.<br /><br />The animation and art is beautiful, spectacularly done. The music is fitting, and the dialogue is great. The characters are so lively and imaginative. The whole movie is full of life and spirit.<br /><br />There is a little bit of romance, some things you might chuckle at, perhaps a bit of surprise, and certainly lots of adventure in this fantasy film. I really enjoy the concept of the importance of your name as a part of your identity and remembering who you are.<br /><br />My son is three years old and cannot read (we watched it in Japanese) and even he was fascinated!<br />Now, I'm not sure this movie is quite as amazing as Howl's Moving Castle or Princess Mononoke, but it is certainly worth watching twice (or more), and is interesting and eye-catching.<br /><br />It may be a bit predictable, as it is a \\"Happily ever after\\" type of movie, but it is WAY better than and less predictable than any Disney movie out there, and has such a curious plot! I recommend it to anyone. Enjoy!
B002JIOOB2|2.0|After hearing so many great things about 'The L Word' I went ahead and bought the entire series. While I admit it makes an effort to be relevant and inclusive, I could not get over the shallow treatment of transgendered individuals and bisexuals on the show. I also failed to see the relevance of the death of someone very likeable in the third season. The moment that happened, I lost all faith in the show itself and in Ilene Chaiken. I thought this series was shallow and failed to go underneath the surface. I also found the writing to be tedious and self-indulgent. This could have been so much better. The only relationship I actually liked was the one between Lara and Dana, although Tina and Bette were not bad either. A disappointment all around, but that is just my opinion.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This has the makings of a great movie and a classic.<br /><br />It has plot twists, points that leave you guessing, shocking moments, it'll make you happy, sad, and start thinking!<br /><br />The characters are interesting and fun, some well-developed, some a little more mysterious.<br /><br />This movie has drama, action, adventure, and is interesting enough for older audiences while still easily capturing the attention of younger audiences.<br /><br />Once again we see a fight between good and evil, except here there is also a struggle to determine where everyone and each action stands as good or evil, neutral, necessary or not. It is also a battle between man, beast, nature, and the problems that arise when there is not harmony and balance.<br /><br />I feel this movie portrays some of Japanese thought and culture while telling a wonderfully adventurous story.<br /><br />I wasn't sure if I would like it but I'm glad I watched it through to the end, because I really enjoyed this anime.
B000007MVD|4.0|These live radio broadcasts reflect astounding wit and warmth coming through with their studio banter. This exemplifies a superb but long forgotten piece of their history.<br /><br />During this point in their career, they were assimilating the American roots of early rock n' roll, R&B, blues and rockabilly into their sound. At its very best they are having a blast playing and hungering for good old rock and roll. And several true finds make their \\"official\\" premiere. \\"A Shot of Rhythm and Blues\\" and \\"Soldier of Love\\" have John tackling Arthur Alexander proudly. He also sings a great \\"Got to Find My Baby\\" that equals Chuck Berry. George does good by the Coasters \\"Young Blood\\". Paul rocks out fiercely on his idol's \\"Lucille\\". And the Mersey Beat anthem, \\"Some Other Guy\\", is fun, raw and vital. But it's John's committed reading of the Shirelles \\"Baby It's You\\" that is the cherry topping it all. This exquisite vocal performance even eclipses Shirley Alston-Reeves.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most of what remains is non-descript or worse. \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\", \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzie\\" and \\"She's A Woman\\", for instance, have none of the verve that the Hollywood Bowl versions have. Perhaps that audience helped to make them sound edgy and exciting. And the other obscurities must have remained as such for a reason.<br /><br />*** 1/2 stars
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I hesitated on buying this book because I have little interest in auto racing. I'm so happy I went for it! This is, quite simply, the best book I've read in years!    Full of wit and wisdom, touching without being sappy, this is what reading books is all about. Enzo will steal your heart.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I happened upon this film while on a flight from Chicago to Amman, Jordan. I was just trying to kill time on an uncomfortable 12 hour flight. I was very pleasantly surprised. As someone who grew up in the deep south, I truly appreciated this movie. Yes, it's a fictional account with quite a bit of artistic license, but it was brilliant. I love this movie and will add it to my collection when I return home from Iraq.
B000059TPN|5.0|What a great movie!  Not only is the movie fantastic, but the special features give great insight into the process of making such a classic.  And it has outtakes, everybody loves that part of the movie.
0691142165|2.0|I hated this book.  I am an economist, so it was not that the material was over my head.  The authors spend way too much time telling the reader,\\"We are going to show you shortly....\\"  That is crap filler.  Almost certainly, neither author would accept this from an undergraduate student, let alone a graduate student.  So, why should the reader have to face it? Both need to take a freshman 101 class in writing.      Also shame on the editor for allowing it to stand.  Nothing in the book is earth shatttering or overly technical, so why tire the reading with unnecessary prose?
1423119509|5.0|I had read most of the reviews and was a little leery of purchasing this item, but at the time I hadn't had any ill results [be it by packing or shipping] so I gave it a go... and when the box arrived, the little kid in me couldn't wait to tear into the plastic but the grown collector couldn't imagine even touching it since it was as pristine as it was! I love this and have already recommended it to a friend for her daughter!!!
B000002HEP|5.0|Should be a top ten rock album on anyone's list.  Hard, blues/late 60's inspired guitar riffs and killer lyrics, words don't describe this album and how it jams.  Buy it only if you are ready to take a trip.  This is rock!  Cheers.    Dr. K.
0545123267|5.0|This is without a doubt my favorite book.  I couldn't put it down and read it in one afternoon cover to cover.  It tells the story of Grace Brisbane a girl who is drawn to the wolves in the forest behind her home and in particular one wolf with yellow eyes.  This wolf turns out to be her rescuer and a werewolf named Sam Roth.  Their relationship and the love between them develops and a steady pace, it is a beautiful story filled with suspense of how much time they have together and the challenge they continue to face.<br /><br />Because I don't want to give too much away you should probably stop reading my review and just buy the book right now (Go!) because you will love it too!<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater captures the characters perfectly, the relationship between Grace and Sam into a beautiful love story that can appeal to teens and a young adult audience.  Grace is a strong and independent character who putting aside her neglectful parents remains whole.  Maggie Stiefvater has written the book by both the perspectives of Grace and Sam and you never want to stop reading!<br /><br />I cannot wait for the sequel \\"Linger\\" and could not recommend any book more!
B001QOGYBI|4.0|\\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" is based on the children's story by Roald Dahl, though it has been embellished a great deal by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) has put the dangerous life of a poultry thief behind him and settled down with Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) and a newspaper job. But, never satisfied with the ordinary, Mr. Fox wants to move out of their hole into fancier digs in a treehouse near the Boggis, Bunce, and Bean farms, which prove to be too much temptation. Mr. Fox desperately wants to pull off one last poultry caper. With his hapless opossum handyman Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky) in tow, he aims to rob all three farms -which doesn't sit well with the human farmers, especially Mr. Bean (Michael Gambon), who vows to kill the crafty fox.<br /><br />This is cute enough for children and clever enough to satisfy adults, who will appreciate Mr. Fox's blunt talk. The addition of two young characters, the Fox's son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) and nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson), seems stranger the more I think about it. But the two young oddballs seem to be there to provide an everybody-has-something-to-contribute theme for the children in the audience. Actually, fans of the story may be more surprised by the changes in theme than in the plot. The derring-do that makes Mr. Fox so \\"fantastic\\" is the object of much criticism, and the plot has been wrangled to service \\"family values\\" themes. That puts a damper on its irreverence, but there is still a lot to like in \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\", including richly colored stop-motion animation.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Classic must have for anyone that likes good heavy rock. It is albums like this that make you realize what the difference between the greats and run-of-the-mill bands. It's the difference between NFL teams and small college teams. : )
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I am a trekker so I must watch this movie even if I was certain this movie would sucks. Thanks God I was wrong. This movie works well and you feel the chemical between our beloved main characteres. You are able to watch a lot of moments in Star Trek that you know happened but you have never seen on screen like Kirk taking the Kobayashi Maru test.<br /><br />I like the action, the story and of course the Enterprise for the first time since the Wrath of Khan this lady is not  the oldest and most beloved ship in the Starfleet but is the newest, coolest and more powerfull ship. I really enjoy this movie and I bought both DVD and Blu-ray version the latter highly recomended because the other 2 discs are full of extras. Is a must buy for everyone who loves good sci fi.
1400064287|4.0|Why do some ideas (marketing messages, urban legends, etc) stick and others don't? This readable book explains that ideas have more stickiness if they are simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional and story-oriented. This formula will come as no surprise to those in marketing, public relations or the media. Even if you are in these fields, though, you will find this book a helpful, concise reminder of these basic principles. One thing I especially loved about this book: the authors didn't just focus on the obvious audience of marketing people. They are also reaching out to teachers. They offer some great advice to teachers on how to make lessons more sticky in the classroom.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Temple Grandin is a very high functioning autistic, but this movie still manages to show in unique visuals and a great performance, the way people with autism think. I had never been impressed with Claire Danes in the past, but she becomes this character both mentally and physically. I see an Emmy and Golden Globe in her future. If this was released in theaters, she would at minimum be nominated for an Oscar as well. In fact, just about every single person in the cast hits all the right notes.<br /><br />Temple Grandin is another fantastic release from HBO. It has a good mixture of her obvious issues and her work in making the treatment of cattle more humane, including a genius design that is still used in many cattle farms today. Having a brother with autism makes this film even more relatable to my life, and while I don't agree with everything Temple Grandin has said about autism throughout her life, she has quite a story.
0786915749|4.0|let's get the bad stuff outta the way right off the bat. this novel was written in the late seventies by rookies so it inevitably suffers in a few areas that i'll break down quickly.   1. the novel is tinged with cheesy humor or dialogue at times, however not often enough to become a nuisance and it cleans up nicely in the subsequent novels.   2. \\"camp-speak\\" - you'll know it when you see it. the companions attempt a sort of retard pig-latin to mask their dialogue. simply the worst idea ever thought of in the universe. the idea is god awful and just throws up on itself. even the author mentions it in the annotated chronicles. fortunately we never see it again after the first time.   3. the songs and poems are silly and embarrasing. you will not look cool reading these to anyone. please dont try. they are however relevant but not a must. i just skip em'.     ====================================================================================    now the good stuff. this book is pure, portable, awesome, fun adventure. i love to see folks standing in a long ass line or waiting in a doctors office picking their nails w/out something to read. it's sad really, all that idle time, just....existing!? pick this bad boy up and you'll be looking for an exuse to wait around.   i read this when i was thirteen. absolutely blown away. i felt like bastion in the school attic. characters with dark complexities; some that are fun and free and funny as well, and some that are angry and burdened; we meet the evils of krynn too and these characters are either deliciously cliched or refreshingly original. and raistlin. yes, there's always raistlin, who will take us through the most fascinating journey of all.   this series has it all and it starts right here. through this doorway you will eventually meet dragons of many colors and intentions, you will witness the mighty dragon orbs at work and the quest for the dragonlance themselves, and the dragon highlords who do the will of the queenof darkness herself. let us not forget the undead who have a part to play, and the evil master from the past...or is it the present? elves and dwarves are represented well and no one can take their eyes off the irrascible kender, this world's answer to the halfling, lest they find themselves bereft of all they hold dear. and one can never discount the actions of the gods themselves; meddling and plentiful and they love to walk the realms of mortal beings, stirring up trouble wherever they please. spellbooks and staffs, dragonfear and dragonbreath, incantations and missing constellations, heretics, true healing, dirty dwarves on skid row, and did i mention raistlin?  this first offering has it's hiccups, but the series hits it's stride in dragons of winter night and never looks back until the end of the legends trilogy. if you take this first one with a grain of salt you will be richly rewarded, as i once was.    no, it isn't as heavy as G.R.R.M. or Tolkien, but it's somehow just as fun and enchanting. there is an incredibly well fleshed out world here and i highly recommend taking your copy wherever you go. don't be surprised if you catch yourself reading the last page of the last book in just a few short weeks! i envy anyone that gets to read this for the first time.    a forgiving & well earned 4 out of 5 stars.
0517548232|5.0|Have you ever wondered whether society needs welfare, rent control, minimum wage, or really any other of these types of safety nets to get along? I read this book a while ago, but I can say It changed the very way I thought about politics, philosophy, and economics. I found myself reading paragraphs over and over again to understand all the implications of his wordy logic. I really don't see how people can say this book is outdated considering our economy is faltering as a result of programs Henry Hazlitt considers unnecessary and even immoral.  The unintended consequences of social programs now glare at me everywhere I turn.     Let's take minimum wage. If you grabbed some random guy off the street and asked whether there should be a minimum wage he would probably say yes- and if you're where I live he would say the current $7.25 \\"isn't enough.\\" Well first of all, who gets to decide what a \\"living wage\\" is anyway? Isn't a question like that totally subjective, in the eye of the beholder one might say? If everyone were able to force their employer to pay what they consider \\"just\\" ($50/hour for stocking groceries sounds nice,) every business would fail rather swiftly. I usually hear that all businessmen are evil and they will always seek to \\"exploit\\" the labor force by paying an \\"unfair wage.\\" I think if this were the case everyone would be making minimum wage. Businesses have to compete to attract employees and offering higher wages is the way to accomplish that. So why implement a minimum wage in the first place? I'm sure it is seen as a solution to help the poor, obviously if businessmen were forced to give more money for labor those working would be better off right?    First lets see what happens to the business. The cost of production has been raised and I feel inclined to say that business will raise prices though this usually wouldn't be the case. Most prices are already at a point where if you lower them the firm wouldn't be making a profit and if you raiseprices demand will fall to a point where you also wouldn't be making a profit. The only other solution is to lower cost of production. This will lead to the unemployment of those whose productivity doesn't justify such a high wage. In the case of where I work no one was immediately laid off but as people quit here and there others were not hired in their stead. Basically if you working a low-skilled job and the government arbitrarily forces your employer to pay you more, you could very well be out of a job all-together. So actually yes, those who are left working would be better off but it will be at the expense of those who have lost their jobs. Which is better $2/hr. or $0/hr? Minimum wage creates unemployment which hurts the poorest the worst.    Or heres a simple one, economic stimulus. Can government stimulate growth in an economy? What if government spends billions of dollars on projects they deem appropriate? I think on the face of it economic stimulus makes no sense simply because all funds going into the economy necessarily had to come from the economy. Even when you print money for these purposes you will eventually have to pay for them in the form of inflation. Not to mention whatever the government decides as an appropriate project will have to be contrary to what consumers actually want considering the force required to carry out these plans.     I highly recommend this book, even if you are a layman don't be discouraged by the word \\"economics.\\" I would consider myself very simple and I feel I grasped this whole capitalism concept pretty well. I can't stress enough the importance of the private ownership over the means of production, the market forces businesses to serve our needs, government will only join up with the wealthy and double-team our poor little behinds. Peace!
B00004TJWE|5.0|S.F. Sorrow is a fantastic pop album from beginning to end.  Supposedly being tagged as the first rock opera ever created (surpassing a certain famous Who album that doesn't even need mentioned) that's only PART of the reason this album is so appealing.    The songwriting... wow.  I mean WOW!  I haven't been blown away by catchy, melodic pop songs like this in a very long time (okay that's not totally true- Family's Music in a Doll House was released in the late 60's and THAT album definitely blew me away, and it was last week I first heard it).    But WOW, moments of S.F. Sorrow are just incredible beyond words.  This is the kind of album where each song is filled with little amazing things, elevating the enjoyability of the experience even more.  \\"Balloon Burning\\" for instance, has really neat guitar tricks during the chorus.  The song would be great even WITHOUT those guitar tricks, but including them makes the song even better.      How about really sad and shocking moments?  That would be \\"Death\\".  THIS SONG SCARES ME A LOT.  The vocal melody is seriously the most disturbing bit of melodic brilliance I've ever heard.  I want to keep hearing it because it's so catchy, but at the same time, the dark, ominous atmosphere makes me wanna cry.  Crazy song.    \\"Trust\\" is another song that reminds me of... heaven, or something pleasant and misty.  It puts me in a state of ease.    The entire first side of the album is incredibly good.  Melodic hooks are *plentiful* on side one, one song after another.      Also, why do so many people hate \\"Baron Saturday?\\"  I've heard people say they think it's straight up annoying, but it's honestly *amazingly* catchy and very very distinct.  I definitely haven't heard anything else like it.  Maybe other people have, but I haven't!    If you had to force me to find a low point on the album, it's probably the verse melody in \\"I See You\\".  It reminds me so much of the Animals \\"We've Got to Get Out of This Place\\".  Probably just a coincidence, and hey, perhaps I'm the only one who hears a similarity between the two.    Also, whoever in the band is writing these really good, sophisticated lyrics deserves a ton of respect.  I love these lyrics!    Overall, WOW.  Greatest pop album, concept album, rock opera -whatever you wanna call it- of the 60's.
B002LMOCJ0|1.0|My copy freezes up and stops responding to my input when I try to play the first cut. I tried cleaning it and it still doesn't work.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|There are moments, in Roland Emmerich's latest \\"The World Is Toast\\" epic, \\"2012\\", when I actually thought he had put together a pretty nifty 'End of the World' fable. True, he had taken the concept straight from the overused Mayan Calendar hype, and much of the plot from Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer's 1933 classic SF novel, \\"When Worlds Collide\\" (if I were one of the authors' heirs, I'd call a good lawyer!), but I was impressed that, for once, Emmerich's usual collection of blue-collar heroes couldn't come up with an easy 'fix' to solve things. Between the radiation, earthquakes, volcanoes, tidal waves, and other mayhem, things get pretty awful on a biblical scale, with incredible FX of the destruction of major cities and landmarks, and I admit it, I was impressed!<br /><br />But then Emmerich's knack for sugar-coating and superficial 'fixes' kicked in, and \\"2012\\" stumbled back from the abyss, into Disney Channel 'cuteness'...the 'arks' are a variation 'lifted' from the fleet of spacecraft from \\"When Worlds Collide\\", but with a design flaw so obvious that even a gerbil could figure it out; enough ash and radiation is pumped into the atmosphere that a generation-long nuclear winter would be a 'given', yet our surviving heroes are partying outside, in what, a year??? And Africa survives, nearly intact???? You can imagine how thrilled the Africans are going to be to see seven arks filled with European, Asian, and American politicians and bureaucrats pulling up, ready to take over!<br /><br />So, ultimately, \\"2012\\" is a disappointment...but I consider it a far more enjoyable film than \\"Independence Day\\", and you may, as I did, get caught up in the grandeur of the destruction, for at least a while. John Cusack and Woody Harrelson are both quite funny, and if I would have to go, I think Harrelson's choice of demise isn't a bad finale for a sixties' rocker!
B00178JDCK|4.0|Up date from February 08 2011 Wow look at all of Them that did Not find My review helpful I should have up dated much sooner,Not that I care because I tell the truth and do good to please Myself Not a bunch of fools. The first time I turned It on It was exactly the Sound I was looking for Shimmer and Space verb.     Okay I Am apologizing for ordering the last one I guess I take the easiest way of ordering but If It makes You feel better It put Me farther In financial problems but If You look on some search there are some still left. Behringer needs to look at what The Customers Is buying and make more of them. If Your buying this Reverb Machine then You must be wanting It for Its Ducking also called Shimmer and Space verb If Not then there are cheaper Reverbs as Danelectro as FAB Echo which Is a nice Sounding older type slap reverbs Sound and there Is the more expensive Line 6 Verbzilla, and Someone wrote Me and said Boss has or did have this effect there are Internet videos showing this effect. My Digitech GSP 2101 quit working right It has Ducking Shimmer which Digitech calls String Swell which Is a Violin type Sound and They call Space verb Giga verb and I made the mistake of buying the Behringer Slow Motion 200 thinking String or Volume Swell was Shimmer then If found what I was looking for on Internet video I hope. I had already Wrote some Songs using My Digitech GSP 2101 and started having dreams about having this Sound effect again and just had to have It.       How well this Behringer RV600 performs and Sounds I have Not received It yet to know but If possible I will do an up date but I have a Behringer EP2500 Power Amplifier that still works good which I even used as part of a Rife, Doug coil machine but the EP4000 would be better for that use Also the fan runs all the time.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|I bought this movie for my wife and settled down to watch it with her prepared to be bored.  To my surprise, the movie turned out to be an enjoyment.  The story is cleverly written and well acted.  Emma enjoys match-making and works on finding suitable partners for her sister, her governess and her new best friend.  What she does is make a mess of things and almost misses out on love herself.  Snuggle up and enjoy this movie with your sweetie....and please, pass the popcorn!
B0035V35PI|5.0|This is a superb film with great action sequences and a pretty good story for a martial arts film.  I got this on import the other day and I'm sure the american version was actually more brutal and gory than the english one - just going by memory?!  The HD transfer is superb and highly detailed and the fact that it comes with dvd and digital transfer for the PSP (or any other mp4 player?) is a bargain.  This also works on european players with no problems! Huge bonus - as it seems to be a kind of russian roulette nowadays with whether-or-not an import blu ray will work or be 'region locked'!!??  Recommend to all martial arts film enthusiasts all around the world!

B0039UTDFG|1.0|Who thought it was a good idea to replace a well respected, knighted Englishman with Oprah? I thoroughly enjoyed the DVDs of Planet Earth and Blue Planet but why does Discovery feel the need to \\"Americanize\\" such a brilliant documentary? I can't even watch it on TV due to Oprah's poor, simplified narration.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|After seeing most of the 1st two episodes on Discovery, I was so disappointed with the narration and writing of this series that I've decided not to watch anymore. The narration was just so silly that I even attempted to watch it while muting the sound but as good as the filming was, I finally just turned it off. It wasn't until I started reading the reviews on Amazon that I found out that David Attenborough did the original narration for \\"Life\\" and that they rewrote it especially for Oprah's U.S. release of the series. What the hell were they thinking? I will NOT watch another episode on Discovery channel, but instead, I too will be purchasing the David Attenborough version.
B001F0RA4S|4.0|I had seen the movie The Hours when it came out and loved it, but never really felt the urge to read the book until I picked it up a week ago and started reading the stunning prologue.  I couldn't stop reading so had to buy it right away.      The book doesn't depend on suspense or major drama to pull the reader along, but rather it's Cunningham's economically rich writing that does it.  He somehow manages to paint whole worlds with very few words.  Inspired by Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, it tells the story of a day over 226 pages, which may not seem like much until you realize that through that one day and 226 pages he tells us about the lives of not one but four people.     The prologue that drew me in so well depicts Woolf's suicide in 1941.  But soon we're in the late twentieth century New York following a woman named Clarissa as she heads out to buy flowers for the party she's throwing for her sick writer friend Richard, who, of course, happens to call her Mrs. Dalloway as a nickname.  We soon find out that though they're just friends, their relationship runs very deep inside each of them.  Then we're back in 1923, with Woolf again, as she struggles to begin the novel that propels the narrative of this one.  The description Cunningham gives of her efforts is the best I've read of the challenges of writing.  Then we shift to 1949, to a woman named Laura Brown who is pregnant with a second child and tries to pull herself from the novel to tend to her family, her husband Dan and little boy Richie, as they set about starting a very special day- Dan's birthday.    The novel jumps back and forth like this between the three main characters with slight digressions to other minor character to enrich the story.  But most of the novel centers on the things that tie these women, and that's not just Mrs. Dalloway.  They all strive to live their lives well.  This means different things for each.  Clarissa just wants to put on a great party for her sick friend.  Laura goes through the motions of trying to please her husband and son, but would really rather just read her book.  These are both poignant stories, but all the more so for the one unexpected thing that ties them the most.  But in the end, Woolf is the centerpiece.  Her challenges resemble those of Clarissa and Laura, but it's the fight to create art that ultimately binds them together.  It shows that great art can truly transform lives.  And great art is what Cunningham's created here.

To top things off her guardian, the reptilian Nils Bjurmann, is planning a spot of revenge. Can her discarded friend Mikael Blomkvist solve the murders?

0195073401|5.0|If there is a textbook that every student of economics needs to read is this one: The difference between understanding this book and not is the difference between a layman and an economist. I am an undergraduate student and I have used this book for self study since I noticed that my university didn't show me the real deal (in the undergraduate courses) in the matter of economic theory.<br /><br />The book gives a complete overview of the modern mathematical economic theory in a clear and accessible way, in contrast to the inaccessible style of specialized books and articles, but not dumbed down like other textbooks. The books has a quite walrasian flavor, since the main author is a distinguished scholar that works in the neowalrasian tradition.<br /><br />The book is divided into 5 sections, individual decision making, game theory, partial equilibrium analysis, general equilibrium analysis and social choice theory and mechanism design. Each section carefully explains the basic theorems of each field and it's main results in a very accessible way and gives the reader basic understanding of their meaning and consequences in understanding economic phenomena. The best section is the one about general equilibrium, following the walrasian tone of the books as whole.<br /><br />Some have criticized the book, since it didn't contain any passages about public choice theory and new institutional economics. Well, I agree that these fields are very important but if the book had to include everything, it would have 3,000 pages. So the author selected some of the most important areas of research, with covers modern equilibrium economics at its best.
9113020730|5.0|The final installment in the Millenium trilogy ties up all the loose ends from the previous two novels into a satisfying finale. Though some reviewers regard this to be the least polished of the series, it is still a worthy book and much better than other books in the genre. If you haven't already, do yourself a favour and go and read the first two books in the series. But first a warning, they are highly addictive.

0385341008|3.0|I read this book hoping that it would live up to all the hype: it didn't for me. I found the story to be a bit too predictable for my liking, with too much of a romantic flavour. The descriptions of the island and what had happened during the war were interesting though.
B002XUL6RG|5.0|The world has been dominated by overbearing, greed fueled and power mad religions, armies and monarchies since the rise of humanoids. It goes on to this very day in it's many forms. Some are refined and cloaked in self-righteousness. Others through blunt force evil. The common denominator is always the same: The conquest and subsequent enslaving of the innocent. What inevitably follows is the systematic attempt to destroy those who speak out against the tyranny. Though voices are silenced, the spirit endures. It is a reality the barbarian can never grasp. For it has no soul.<br /><br />One such voice came in the form of Bobby Sands. The story of 'Hunger' concerns him, but it would be a mistake to believe that he was it's sole bearer. He was a representative of a much larger effort to see a united Ireland join the world of independent and free countries. A cause that stretched from the footsteps of men, women and children to the prisoners of the the notorious H-Blocks.<br /><br />I had read about the hunger strike in 1987. A book by the name of 'Skylark Sing Your Lonely Song' documented the path taken by it's author, Bobby Sands. Each page of that book was more difficult to turn than the last. It was painful, yet necessary to understand what happened, what series of events that led to the strike.<br /><br />I had heard rumors of movies under consideration to portray the life and times of the prisoners in the Maze. Over the years, I lost track of what might eventually get made. So when I came across 'Hunger' on Netflix, I was hopeful. Remembering the book, I went into the screening just wanting to see an accurate portrayal. What I found was a matter of fact retelling of the hunger strike without fanfare, special effects or heroic sappy dialogue.<br /><br />There is an extended, one shot scene that features Sands (Michael Fassbender) and a priest named Father Dominic Moran (Liam Cunningham). The scene is brilliantly written and acted. The banter plods along, darts and sometimes dances until it gets to the heart of the matter. Clearly one of the finest moments in film that I have come across in some time.<br /><br />The 'supplements' are filled with more on the story and the making of the film. We find out exactly who this 'Steve McQueen' is, hear from the actors and are treated to a BBC piece on the Hunger Strike that was never shown in the United States. I highly recommend these extras.<br /><br />'Hunger' was crafted in sparse, stark tones by director, Steve McQueen. It is an intense, and direct portrait of a dynamic event that unfolded in the early 1980's.

B00337KM2S|5.0|In \\"Up in the Air\\" George Clooney starts off as a cold-blooded, self-absorbed man whose job is telling people that their companies are firing them (laying them off). His business is thriving because we are, of course, in the middle of a recession, His job requires him to travel incessantly and rack up millions of frequent flyer air miles. His goal in life, perhaps his only goal, is to prove how self-sufficient he is and reach ten million miles. He's good at his job at giving people the ax and uses psychology to make them accept it. He's full of slogans and bromides for himself and others.<br /> The ghoulish company he works for has a lot of people on the road flying everywhere to tell people that they've been made redundant; that their jobs have been terminated. As far as the poor people are concerned, they as human beings have been terminated. In many brief scenes we see these people reacting sometimes profanely to Clooney's news. He also, in his spare time, gives inspirational talks on how people have to be sharks and worry only about themselves and their needs, not to weigh themselves down, the philosophy of selfishness.<br /> Along comes a young woman who talks Clooney's boss into taking all the bad news purveyors off the road to save money by having the hapless terminated people be informed by tele-conferences. Clooney says the idea stinks because the people need to confront a real person.<br /> He takes this young woman out on the road to show her what the human dimensions of the job are. She has to first learn to pack economically and not have any checked luggage. Out on the road, as she gives the bad news, one woman even threatens suicide.

It shows how efficiently he goes through security, how he goes to the airport frequent flyer lounges, how often travel workers greet him by name. He loves being the seasoned, honored frequent traveler. He's a pro at what he does, spending 322 days on the road. But isn't he in reality a loser, lacking a co-pilot, nothing but a parenthesis?e.

B002DW92T8|5.0|Drive analyzes the literature on performance, citing case studies and research, with practical examples on how to implement solutions for motivating yourself and others.  Some highlights and thoughts:    * Research shows autonomy to be the fuel behind motivation.    * People want freedom over mode, method, and timing, to varying degrees.     * After establishing baseline rewards, the marginal benefit of additional performance rewards falls precipitously.     * Hidden costs accompany contingent rewards, such as the reduced motivation and less creative thinking on process driven changes.    * Anticipation of rewards has been found to lead to irrational exuberance. Example, casinos use give-a-ways and noise to entice players.    * Referenced the book \\"Punished by Rewards\\" The trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, As, Praise, and other Bribes by Alfie Kohn    * Different people need autonomy over different areas of their lives, and goals should be built towards helping a person achieve mastery in those areas deemed most important.    * Whether a person believes in entity theory (intelligence is fixed) or the incremental theory of intelligence (effort and skill based)  provides clues on whether a person enjoys autonomy over tasks or outcome.  - see Carol Dweck's research for further reading.    * Learning goals lead to an increased skill set and self actualization - that is, aligning a person's actual self with idealized self.     * Feedback should be the core principle behind metrics based goals.    * Peer reviewed based rewards systems, unexpected rewards, and shared goal setting increase satisfaction.     * Goals should have a higher meaning.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Both Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law bring an energy to the personas of Holmes and Watson that has been rarely seen. A mix of mystery, adventure, action, sci-fi and comedy, SHERLOCK HOLMES has a splash of everything and it works extremely well.    What Downey was able to do was exaggerate the known Holmes' skills (from deductive and inductive intelligence, through the arts of combat to his eccentric quirkiness), but avoid exaggerating them so much as to make them unbelievable.    The rapport between Holmes and Watson is much more human and equal than the superior/inferior, genius/buffoon that is often portrayed.    Those without imagination and particularly purists who only treasure the Conan Doyle canon and avoid pastiches of all kinds will not take to this film, but for anyone who enjoys lively adventure with a personable cast, SHERLOCK HOLMES is a must see.
B00328G4V6|4.0|Ok, so the \\"Stone Free\\", \\"Fire\\" and \\"Red House\\" retreads are not really all that interesting. \\"Valleys Of Neptune\\" has potential but ultimately feels very naked and incomplete. Kind of a strectch to name this release after that track. \\"Mr. Bad Luck\\" is kind of fun and is a decent recording considering it's probably the only song here originally meant for any kind of release. \\"Sunshine of your Love\\" was good for a couple of listens but probably won't make it to my iPod. \\"Ships\\" and \\"Lullaby For The Summer\\" are supposedly earlier workings of songs from the \\"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\\" album. Both sound good but I can't really compare as I have not heard \\"First Rays\\" yet. I ordered it along w/ this and will soon. We'll see which versions actually make it to my iPod.    With that aside, let's get to the meat of the compilation...    \\"Bleeding Heart\\" is a very strong track and one I'll be listening to over and over. Perfect song for Hendrix to have convered considering its blues and funk aspects. He absolutley nails it. It's a song that has a heartbeat to it as it feels like it should never end. This particular rendition of \\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\" is one of the better ones I've heard by Hendrix and is definitely a highlight as it is very intense. \\"Lover Man\\" is like a freight train barreling down on you at 90 miles an hour w/ it's driving rhythm. Jimi's lead playing here sounds very SRV-ish if you know what I mean. \\"Crying Blue Rain\\" is an intesting instrumental that goes many different directions and leaves you guessing which way it might go next.    All I can say is I'm glad I ordered the Bonus Tracks version from Target because these two tracks are among the most intersting on the CD. \\"Slow Version\\" and \\"Trash Man\\" highlight a guitar player at the top of his game in terms of raw creativity and technique. These tracks more than any others here give that \\"what might have been\\" feeling that I think a lot of us were hoping for when we bought this CD. I can only imagine having had been there when he was jamming on these two tunes back in '69 thinking \\"he just continues to grow and impress. The sky's the limit!\\"     What a shame he had to leave us so soon but at least we still have some examples of his genius left over. Even if they are just \\"scraps\\".

B001OQCV6K|3.0|....for this movie.  It was highly entertaining in and of itself, and did NOT need to have been called a Sherlock Holmes movie.  Perhaps they couldn't sell it on its own merits as a fun, adventure-packed Victorian romp.  So they attached it, albeit loosely and rather insultingly*, to Sherlock Holmes.    If they hadn't called these characters by Conan Doyle's character names....there wouldn't be all of these criticisms by Holmes-fans. It would have been viewed on its own merits instead of it becoming an evaluation of the accuracy of the pastiche.  If it had been set up as a fantasy-adventure-thriller-buddy-film.....  But THAT wouldn't have sold it, they needed a NAME to carry it into the market.    So.  We have this FUN ROMP of a movie, some great humour moments, great EFX, and a very entertaining Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law set of interactions.  It's worth a watch on an excellent screen, and will be fun to see a second or third time.    They just got the name wrong.        * I mean, c'mon. They didn't really pay any attention to the Holmes stuff, they just committed identity theft.
B002RKS81O|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book. I'm not a romance novel kind of guy, but decided to check it out on my Kindle (free). I found the old English a little hard to read comfortably, but that passed. With all the hoopla about Jane Austin and her novels, I cought a movie during a plane ride entitled \\"The Jane Austin Book Club\\" and enjoyed it too. Don't be afraid guys, it wont hurt and you might even like it.
0525948023|1.0|This book teaches that there are many ways to God which is a lie straight from the pit of hell.  This book is very misleading especially to Christians.  Read your bible.  Stop trying to better your flesh and live a \\"worldly\\" life.  The bible tells us to die to our flesh and live for Jesus!  The bible is very clear that there is ONLY one way to God and that is through Christ Jesus!  Satan would like nothing better than to further this kind of Eastern mysticism and pull you away from the Truth which is Jesus.  Please stay away from this type of unbiblical worldview.  It can leave you eternally separated from God.
0812550757|5.0|Coming right off Ender's Game I didn't know quite what to expect. I had predicted the penultimate chapter of Ender's Game but I expected the story to end there. I had been impressed with the cutting insights into the human condition but I did not foresee the end at all. I was rocked back on my heels as I blew through the final chapter. When I noticed it was called \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" I was hit by several realizations and anticipations. It was with that final chapter fresh in my mind that I dove into \\"Speaker.\\"     At first I was a little annoyed by the somewhat arbitrary use of languages; I still don't entirely see how it contributes to the core story/message. The embedded definitions didn't help much either. But my perseverance has been rewarded many times over as Card's highly perceptive portrayals of church/state interaction, evolution of machine intelligence, family dynamics, personal sacrifice, and the failings of scientific rigor and the political and social control of the same continue to open my eyes, one page after another. I know I will want to read this book again just to soak up and solidify the many challenging and illuminating ideas Card has planted in my consciousness. This book can't help but further human understanding across the board. I feels like I am participating in some sort of perceptual evolution. Like I've stepped through some sort of door and everything's changed. I must say I really wasn't prepared for this deep of a read.

1439190275|5.0|I like this book \\"The New Atkins for a New You\\" a lot.  It reinforces the ideas presented in the original versions.  The Atkins program works for weight loss and for health.  The biggest issues with the program are people and their lack of understanding.  They talk without ever actually reading the books. When learned correctly and followed as a way of life and not as another diet the results are remarkable.  I don't mean just in weight loss either.  I have never felt tired or listless on this plan.  My energy levels are increased and I have never felt as good.  My skin is healthier, my lab works are improved and I have been weaned from blood pressure medications.  I applaud this book because I feel it is easier to read and understand for all.  There are many meal plan suggestions to help people  understand just how much can be eaten depending on what stage they are in.  It is varied and stresses good foods. Carb counting is mentioned in many diets today and more and more diabetics are carb counting to control their blood sugars. I understand some fears that people may have after being conditioned for so long to eat low fat foods.  One needs to just take a look at people around them to see that those low fat diets aren't working.  I feel we all have a right to an opinion and I just ask that people read the book before making judgements.

B002WCLG48|4.0|The compilation of stories that mold together to make the DVD is helpful, though, very much like the \\"Animatrix\\". Though the technology is somewhat the same, the story line is a bit more violent, which creates a more exciting feel.
B00168OIOE|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater and on dvd, however on a Blu-ray disc it really shines. As with other animations the color saturation and the image clarity with a Blu-ray is phenomenal.  In addition the soundtrack for this film sounds great in this transfer.  Having the digital copy and DVD included make this a great set ( I ended up selling off my previous DVD).  If you don't already own this on DVD this is a great way to get all three mediums at one time so that you can take it on trips with a portable DVD player, iPhone (or even an iPad), or enjoy it at home on Blu-ray with a fabulous picture and excellent sound quality.    I love it!

1595141715|5.0|One of the best YA books I have ever read.  Even though you knew where it would end I had no idea how it would get to that inevitable conclusion.  The characters were real and heart wrenching.
1847388051|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed this book. It seems that my collection of books is beginning to include more and more that are not related to fantasy or paranormal or magic of any kind whatsoever. This book right here is the perfect reason why. It contains so much that I enjoy and I am so glad I have opened up my options of reading material. I really enjoyed how the author switched back and forth between the main characters viewpoints. I'm not typically a fan of this type of storytelling but I have to say I think it is starting to grow on me, especially when it's done so well.    Perfect Chemistry may be a story that has been told before but the author tells it in a new way. I loved the idea of a modern day Romeo and Juliet type romance. I've never been in a gang nor have I ever known anyone in a gang so I couldn't really tell you if the way gang life is described in the book is as realistic as it gets, but to me it seemed pretty darn realistic.     I try not to include spoilers what so ever in my reviews so let me just say that the two main characters, Brittany and Alex, were written very well. I laughed with them, laughed at them, pitied them, felt for them and cheered them on. I wanted them to be happy and I wanted things to work out. I won't tell you if they do or not, that's for you to read and find out!!    I recommend this book to anyone but there is mild drugs and sex involved so anyone mature enough to read about such topics.
0439023483|5.0|This is not a book I would of necessarily read on my own...it was suggested by a friend who works in our school's library. From the moment I started the book I couldn't put it down. I read it in two days and moved on to the second book, \\"Catching Fire.\\"  Ms. Collins does an amazing job of bringing life's lessons, love, and conflict into such a wonderful piece of literature. I'm telling all my friends to read it and pass it on to the kids!
1416914307|5.0|Well I already told you it's one of my favorites so that should say something. I don't know what it is about Clare's writing but she sucks me right into her books everytime. The first two books in the series I had a difficult time putting down when I had to, but with this it was just impossible, I read it in a straight shot. The characters are engaging and they grew as the series progressed. I won't give anything away but I love the ending and i'm very glad that's how Clare decided to end it. It was full of suspense, action, comedy, romance everything us YA readers love to read about. The book has a great plot and everything that happens from the beginning until the end somehow fits into the conclusion of the book. Jace was my favorite character throughout the first two books and was again in this one. He has that sarcastic wit and charm about him and you can't help but love his character. Overall if I had a rating system, which I don't yet but I will get eventually, it would be a 5/5! I recommend this book to anyone and if you haven't read the first two in the series they are City of Bones and City of Ashes. You will not regret it!
B00005MP58|4.0|I first saw the newest version of this movie, then watched this one. THis one follows the book more closely, and is not \\"hollywoodized\\" like the newer one. I liked both!

0385523904|5.0|A fascinating, well written, and moving account of life in North Korea.  While I expected it would be a good book based on the reviews, author, and subject matter, it exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend it to anyone, regardless of whether you have a strong interest in Korean history or culture.  (I did not before reading this book).    I hope this book continues to receive the publicity, accolades and readers it well deserves.
0312356854|5.0|This is a book that holds your attention. The author uses the technique of weaving two stories together. Once you begin to read, you don't want to put it down.   The copy I ordered came in timely fashion and in good repair. Purchased from Amazon.
0307266303|5.0|I ran two marathons in 2006 and 2007 and then pretty much \\"retired\\".  I just lost interest in doing the long runs tho the shorter runs were ok.  When I read \\"Born to Run\\" I hadn't run any meaningful distance in over 18 months preferring to focus on my strength goals.  Now having said all that... I'm giving serious consideration to picking up running again.  That's how good the book was to me.  Just fascinating.  I can't seem to stop talking about it any time the subject of running comes up with my running friends.  I bought an extra copy for my best friend (his gf and him are avid runners) and I lent my copy to another friend who has no intention of running (he admits he pretty much only runs to dinner) but agreed that he could use some more exercise in his weekly habits.  I've started to walk around barefoot more and plan on buying a pair of Vibrams.  I'm in no way related to the author but I feel like I should have negotiated some sort of sponsorship deal. =P  As a side note, I heard about this book from a strength and bodybuilding site (tnation) and if you ever read thru their articles, you'll see that they pretty much lay the smack down on distance runners but when you see several respected strength coaches mention this as a book to read(even tho they're not recommending that everyone start doing long distance running) then I think that says something.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Great movie. Very intense..... Gory, even. Very interesting storyline. \\"Science fiction as it was meant to be: intelligent and challenging\\"    Director Neill Blomkamp teams with producer Peter Jackson for this tale of extraterrestrial refugees stuck in contemporary South Africa. It's been 28 years since the aliens made first contact, but there was never any attack from the skies, nor any profound technological revelation capable of advancing our society. Instead, the aliens were treated as refugees. They were the last of their kind, and in order to accommodate them, the government of South Africa set up a makeshift home in District 9 as politicians and world leaders debated how to handle the situation. As the humans begin to grow wary of the unwelcome intruders, a private company called Multi-National United (MNU) is assigned the task of controlling the aliens. But MNU is less interested in the aliens' welfare than attempting to understand how their weaponry works. Should they manage to make that breakthrough, they will receive tremendous profits to fund their research. Unfortunately, the highly advanced weaponry requires alien DNA in order to be activated. When MNU field operative Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is exposed to biotechnology that causes his DNA to mutate, the tensions between the aliens and the humans intensifies. Wikus is the key to unlocking the alien's technology, and he quickly becomes the most wanted man on the planet. Ostracized and isolated, Wikus retreats to District 9 in a desperate bid to shake his dogged pursuers

0307463745|4.0|The general premise of Rework is similar to other writing by 37Signals: simple solutions, saying 'no' more than 'yes', and creating a small, working team (as opposed to a top-heavy organization). It is a quick read presented in digestible chunks that let me pick it up and read it for 5 - 15 minutes here and there without feeling I had lost much of the essence. I tend to evaluate books in two ways: 1) How much did the book challenge my thinking while I read it? and 2) How much of the book sticks with me 2 days, 2 months, and 2 years down the line?     On the first dimension, I think Rework does a great job challenging conventional thought, but is pretty similar to their earlier book, Getting Real. Whereas Getting Real focused on what to do (and, as they often point out, what NOT to do) when building software, Rework talks about what to do (and NOT to do) when building a company. A lot of the concepts are the same, which is so brilliantly simple. Just as we are what we eat, our products reflect our [corporate] culture, whether we like it or not.  The ideas presented here are revolutionary, especially for someone new to 37Signals, its just that I had just heard them before.     That said, Rework is going to stick with me for a long time. I have already internalized a few catch phrases like 'mass' and 'do the work before you hire for it' that will be with me for a long time. The first third or so of the book which focuses on doing something, *anything*, of your own was incredibly inspiring and been energizing me for a couple weeks. There is a lot of really good, practical advice for start ups from people who have lived it: keeping it small, not acquiring mass before you need it, picking the right people, not getting venture capital, etc. Mostly, I'm left remembering that \\"action is always better than inaction\\" (from the phenomenal book [[ASIN:B001GCVFIM Stumbling on Happiness]]) because failure and success aren't always quite so polarizing as we imagine they are.     This is a book that I'd like to read every year, just to remind myself to keep it simple.

Un-consented research in the name of science which turns into multi-billion dollar businesses of which the family gets none....they can't even afford health care!  A snapshot into USA life in 1951 when WWII is over and trials going on regarding unspeakable Nazi crimes in the name of science...and just look into our own back yard!!!

B0034BW9CO|5.0|In retrospective, when i first read these reviews i thought it was a little far fetched to compare this new kid i never heard about to great groups like Aventura and Xtreme, which i'm a big fan of. With this name i thought was kind of corny. But i got the cd and for the past week that's all i've been listening to. The name had to grow on me more than his music did because as soon as i uploaded it to my ipod and listen to it, i was an instant fan. DON'T DELAY AND GET THIS!!!
B002M9WW30|5.0|This is an amazing collection. A must have for a blu-ray collection. All six movies and a bonus disc for only $37 + free shipping. ADDDDDRRRRRIIIAAAANNNN!!!!
0439023491|5.0|This is the second book of The Hunger Games. I can't believe the way I was drawn into the Hunger game books! I really love them and can't wait for the third book! I have never read anything like this before. I have read vampire and ghost books, but nothing futuristic/apocalyptic. I think I have another favorite genre!I seriously can't stop thinking about this book! I really wish I didn't have to wait for the third book to find out what's going to happen.<br />In Catching Fire things get crazy! There are so many unexpected turn of events in this book! Oh and let me not forget the action. I don't think I have ever had a book make me so nervous before. Even at calm moments your nervously waiting for the next big thing to happen.<br />This book is amazing and Collins is definantly one of my favorite authors now! If your new to sci-fi, as I am, I would have to say this book is an excellent one to start with!
0307454541|1.0|I don't know.  Isn't the truth about the world ghastly enough?  What a lovely read---to find out why more than a hundred women have been raped and hacked to death.  One doesn't need to read this book to scope out such stories.  Why, all you have to do is turn on the evening news.  Sigh....it's hard to be human sometimes.  What a horrible book!
B00275EGWY|5.0|Outstanding Movie! As a Former Marine I found it very realistic and spot on. Many people forget that \\"War Is A Drug\\" I highly recommend it A+A+A+A+
B002U6CJCO|2.0|I was looking forward to watching this film because of the cast billing (Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren and Andrei Arlovski)and the high publicity it received. That changed when I actually saw the entire film. As with all of Jean's and Dolph's movies you get a lot of rock-em sock-em action and this one did not disappoint in that aspect. What was disappointing was that there were barely any speaking parts for the main stars, just monosyllabic responses to questions asked by the supporting cast. Dolph's character did not appear until the last quarter of the movie. So, if you want a modern day silent film (ahem) with lots of martial killing then you will enjoy this film. I simply did not!
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|I like the original \\"Thopmas Crown Affair\\" over the remake - Both films are entertaining, but the original is believable.
B002X20W2E|4.0|I've never been a Rihanna fan until I bought this album. The main reason this album is so great is because it has personality. Her other albums were all over the place and she didn't really write any of the music. This one is focused and has a cool Goth R'n'B vibe. She can't sing umbrella forever she's growing up and going through her 20's. I recommend this album and I really don't like top 40 music. Don't waste your time with the edited version. Explicit is the way to go. Every song is very good. My personal favorites are the more Explicit songs like G4L and Rock star 101. They're more grown up and they are just kick ass songs I never expected from her.
B0027REDK2|5.0|This is the best version of Rio ever.  It contains the complete UK LP versions of the Rio songs along with the US LP versions of the first five songs, demos, B-Sides, and night club versions.  However, save your earlier Rio CD, along with Strange Behaviour, and the Singles Box Set.  All the versions used on this album are slightly different then the versions on the former CDs.  Especially, the versions of Hold Back The Rain, Rio, and My Own Way.  This is a great addition for any Duran Duran fan.
B00275EGWY|5.0|A good movie, an eye opener to what happens in these far away countries. However, it annoys me that while our young men are fighting and dying over there, their own men are looking for safe havens in other countries.<br />Oh, and lastly, there were also British and Australian bomb disposal soldiers there too.<br />:o)
B000I2J6K0|4.0|This workout is great... I started it when I was going into my 3rd trimester so it was a good workout where it pushed me and not a simple workout... in my opinion.
B0000027RL|4.0|I have to admit I hated this when it first came out but it did grow on me over time.  I prefer their second release Vs. to this myself and also prefer bands like STP and Alice in Chains over Pearl Jam.   This is a good to great album but I do think it is somewhat overrated.  I think the song writing is fine, its the vocals that bug me.  I seen another review where the reviewer talks about the garbled vocals, I have to agree.
B001KMB6VE|5.0|This film in no way rates the 1 star ratings people have been giving it. It's a very realistic look at where we are heading in a world lead by the fear of terrorism and corporate greed. Hyper inflation, third world poverty, the systematic breakdown of civilization is just a reflection of were we are heading today. This is a story of hope within those times.
B00000DSEK|5.0|This album came out of no where.  I loved No Rest For the Wicked but understood why others thought it was a little weak.  Then this gets released and it has just monster hits on it.  This was one of the greatest hard rock/metal albums released in its time period.  People are in love with his older solo stuff which I understand but this stands right up there with any of them.  This is my favorite Ozzy album followed by No Rest For the Wicked.
B0034C9CFK|1.0|I realise that I am going to be in a minority here, but I have to ask the queation, why is it Alan, that you could follow up the excellent 'Good Time' album, with an outing as mundane & uninteresting as this? I have been a fan for as long as you have been recording, & with the exception of the atrociously tedious 'Like Red on a Rose', I am the proud owner of all your other studio albums, plus both Greatest Hits, and the exceptional live outing with George Strait & Jimmy Buffet. So the release of a new AJ album is normally an event I look forward to. Not so in the case of 'Freight Train'. And I am profoundly thankful that I had the opportunity to listen to the entire album before purchasing it. What a disappointment, with only 3 tracks worth listening to: the ballads 'Taillights Blue' & 'Till the End', & the catchy, 'I Could Get Used To This Lovin' Thing'. Really Alan, you are a truly great talent - both singer & songwriter - but you can do much better than this. Your fans deserve better. There are too few country artists today, who can honestly claim to be adherents to traditional country music, & Alan jackson is certainly one of them, however, limp & lifeless songs & albums (like this album & the majority of its songs) that lack the spirit of that tradition, while no doubt satisfying the die-hard fans who think Alan can do no wrong, is unlikely to win over new fans - to the artist or the genre. Oh please, do better the next time Alan.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|general review, Bad things: the letterbox is too much, film too dark, no special features-cheap-\\"tight when it squeaks-whatever\\", also, its listed but then it says may not be there and at the end of most of these fx\\" you can clearly see the usual stupid, cheap fake now days digital animated pc fx, it could have had better action scenes, otherwise a long, pretty good movie.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This movie thoroughly deserves all its acclaim. It brings to the general viewing audience a tale about the ancient Maori people and solidified in my mind how great people like the venerable Maori soprano, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, really are to have made it in the face of great odds.  But what I think would have brought tears to a stone was the tenacity of the love which the central character, Paika, had for her grandfather (her true father figure), Koro, despite all his efforts to discount her and the great value she brought to that relationship. And that is a struggle so many of us have, the struggle of a child to gain the approval of a parent. Some give up, but she never did, and they both gained. It is a redemptive tender story which I recommend highly.
B002GJT4Y6|5.0|I have really enjoyed both of the new Ultimate Editions.  The added scenes really help the flow of the stories.  It really looks nice, too and I've saved the trading cards for my children.
B003156COO|3.0|This review is specific to the audio book (CD).  The history is fascinating.  I have always enjoyed these \\"behind the scenes\\" looks at the inner workings of modern business.  The challenge with listening to this type of book is there is so many names and details to keep straight.  It is easy to do when reading at your own pace and being able to refer back.  But it is much harder with an audio book.  This challenge is exacerbated with this audio book because the two readers read the book at a much-to-intense pace.  This is one that I wold have rather read then listened to on CD.
0345477618|5.0|Being a Star Wars fanatic for nearly 30 years, in my wildest dreams I could not have imagined the wealth of information in this book. If it were just the pictures, many I'd never seen before, I would've been enthusiastic, but the way this is written, it's like I was there during production. A better book on Star Wars A New Hope I, obviously, can not imagine.
0140441409|5.0|I will keep it short:    Amazon shipped the order rather quickly - the book came nice and new - the reading itself is irreplaceable.  Would definitely recommend for others.
B00337KM2S|4.0|Up in the Air is well made, has good actors, has a decent premise, and has some good moments. Four stars. But for me I did not connect with George Clooney playing Ryan Bingham, because Ryan Bingham seemed more of a sketch idea for a character than an actual person. I suppose the scenes where he takes Vera Farmiga's character to his home town were an attempt to provide some substance, but even that was more of a sketch - especially since even to his own family he was not really substantial. Ryan Bingham has no home (a bare apartment he's rarely in), no friends, no friendly co-workers, no past (except for the hometown visit), no real character at all. He feels more like a vehicle for a movie idea than a person. To Clooney's credit, he made Ryan Bingham watchable, because George is a likeable guy, but still I felt there was \\"no there there\\".<br /><br />I thought Vera Farmiga was the best actor in this movie. She conveyed so much with just a look. Anna Kendrick was OK but didn't quite ring true in some scenes, such as when she breaks down in front of Ryan and Alex and tells them about what she wants from life. Jason Bateman and others were fine.<br /><br />There were quite a few good moments - many from the people losing their jobs, some from Ryan's family, some from Alex, etc. There were some funny moments too. But for me it never pulled together into a great movie because I didn't really care about Ryan Bingham, or even really have much of an idea of who he was.<br /><br />On a side note, the music choices for the movie were good but the music was almost too intrusive it was so up front at some points.<br /><br />I can recommend this movie, it's worth seeing, it's good, but for me it was not great.
B000JIHP88|4.0|This is a great mobile, has lots of settings and the baby can turn it on and off. I waited till my son was 8 months old and I think that was too late. He likes it ok, but it doesn't help him sleep or be happy sitting in his crib alone.
B0029O08WA|3.0|I love music, any kind of music. I loved the Twilight soundtrack and had it in my car CD player for at least 2 months. This soundtrack I listened to but was a little let down. I looked at Stephanie Meyers playlist & all the songs I thought were great didn't make it onto the soundtrack. I only really liked the first two songs on it. Figuring  the amount of songs I actually listened to, I give it a FAIR.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold has delivered with City of Evil, which in my opinion, is their best yet. Complicated rhythm sections and dueling solos are just a few things about this CD that I enjoyed. If you're a fan of Iron Maiden, then you definitely need to check out this CD because the Iron Maiden influence is here.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|This movie should be mandatory for every high school student in the country.      C. Scholz
1436109817|1.0|The guy doing the reading of this book is a graduate of a drama university.  He doesn't talk like a kid and, in fact, sounds bored with the whole thing.   I read the actual book and it was great!  I thought the audio book would be a fun thing to take on vacation so that my family could enjoy the book too.  Boy, was I wrong!!!   We shut the CD off after about 5 minutes.  What a waste of money!  The reader drones on and on and hardly changes the pitch of his voice.  You can't get any clue of the excitement and fun of the book because the reader is so bad!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  Get the actual book and read it out loud if you want others to enjoy the story.  You'll do a much better job than the clown they hired to read this!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|short and sweet - it was really nice to hear the old beatles without snap, crackle and pop.
140120841X|4.0|So I'm finding now that the movie cut out several pertinent plot points from the novel, but i'm strangely okay with it, since had they held true to the graphic novel even at a 90% they would've easily added another hour and a half of runtime...<br /><br />Regardless, I definitely reccommend checking it out, and thats a serious thing coming from me, since I'm primarily a Marvel fan, straying from all DC and Vertigo works with the exception of Batman comics!!<br />Snoochie Boochies :) !!!!!
0307454541|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time!  I'm a huge fan of murder mysteries, but this one is complex, unpredictable, and definitely a page-turner.  It took me about 100 pages to get hooked (and keep all the characters with Swedish names straight) but after that I couldn't put it down.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|My husband & I have enjoyed watching this movie with friends and family several times.  The story at the beginning is a particularly touching tale of dreams and loss and leads to a wonderful resolution.  The graphics are awesome, too.
006054094X|5.0|This book is a fascinating and heavily documented history of Chinese exploration of the world in the 15th Century. I highly recommend it.
B001C09KD0|5.0|This is an incredible Book! I find myself smiling while reading it and enjoying every story she tells. She's an admirable woman, who gives examples of life situations that make you think about yours and find different perspectives to things that you saw unclear or irrelevant.     -- LOVED IT--
B002XTBE6K|1.0|Imust apologize for giving Gweneth Paltrows version of Emma a bad review. upon looking  at the DVD again I find it was the version with Ramoli Garai that was so poorly done.  She seemed confused at times and looked as tho she couldn't remember her lines very  quickly.The older version with Kate Beckinsale was the best in my opnion. She  brought credibility to the times it was set in as well as a sauciness that was delightful.  I have not seen Gweneth Paltrows version. However If something isn't broken, why try to  fix it.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Avatar is unprecedented. It has no equal. It is simply the best. Best of its kind and the best film i've ever seen, and very well deserving of all its praise.    This film is why i go to the movie theater, heck, it's why they were built! This isn't just a movie, it's truly a one of a kind experience that nobody should miss out on; and a true film experience doesn't happen often. No movie will immerse you, grab and take hold of you like Avatar. The visuals are stunning and breathtaking, no doubt near the best created to date. Spectacular.  Now for the story. Some people love to knock the storyline and i'm sick of it. There's a reason that this particular story/situation has been used time and again. Because it works, its a GOOD story, a true story as in its played out many, many times throughout history and thus people respond to it, it hits you in the heart and touches you. It's incredibly moving no matter how predictable. It's a well used plot because it's a good one, and being predictable doesn't necessarily make something bad, you add Avatars story and strong messages of acceptance/understanding and respect to the visual aspect and you've got one remarkable film.      As for the DVD's, I don't mind the double and triple drip at all. If you don't care about extras buy it now, if you want extras, wait. I know i'll be purchasing all versions and i don't mind in the least. We have been given plenty of clear warning as what to expect and when. They're not sneaking around behind our backs. It's been made perfectly clear whats coming. I've no doubt this first edition will be the best Blu-ray we've seen so far, fantastic quality. I'm also very interested in all the extra features so i will buying the November release as well. Never have i double dipped before, never before have i wanted to and not minded in the least.     If you missed out on seeing it in 3D in theaters, you should be ashamed and i suggest you get back there to see it if/when it's re-released into theaters this Fall. The way Avatar used 3D is why it was so successful. There have been plenty 3D films in the past but none to ever use it quite this way, which is why i don't think 3D as just a gimmick will last. It has to add depth and completely immerse you in the movie the way Avatar did. It has to fill you with wonder, not simply make you duck or jump. Avatar accomplished this in the most beautiful way, and it deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible. This is why i'm in no panic for the 3D Blu to come out. They're right to wait. Simply not enough people own 3D TV's/Theater setups yet. A 2011 3D Blu release sounds good, it'll also give me something to look forward to in between this and the sequel.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|This series rocks. I have not been this into a tv series ever. Starz has really done this perfectly it has gotten me so interested in the character of Sparacus, and other characters that I am reading books on this subject now. I have really enjoyed this the series has everything great battles, alot of gore, tons of nudity, and really shows what the life would have been like back then. Very Highly recommended. I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I find myself watching the reruns over, and over, and they never grow old.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I really enjoyed this album.  Lizzy Hale provides excellent vocals.  Her voice is so clear that you can actually make out most of the lyrics, which to me matters.  And the lyrics are even well written.    Her vocals are backed by a fine hard rock band.  Any of you who've look at Halestorm videos have surely noticed that Ms. Hale is quite attractive in addition to being a skilled singer.    This is only their first album, but based on what I enjoyed hearing I think they're going to be around for a while as they have real talent.    I'm really picky and even I enjoyed it.  You might too.
1408460300|1.0|Mythical, secret, great are constantly overused.  A very boring book that was painstaking to get through.  If you really liked Da Vinci code at least you have something positive to think about Brown.      I'll never read Dan Brown again.  This was a waste of time.
B0036XN2L2|2.0|First, I would like to thank Scorpions for bringing up so many great albums and songs for many many years. And ofcourse, their live shows are amazingly entertaining. Unfortunately, this album came to me as a big disappointment. Please don't get me wrong, just as much as I love their 80s stuffs, I found their last album (Humanity) to be an extremely great album, but this one? I could not find a single song (apart from the ballads) that I wanted to hear more than 2 times. Ballads were not even that great. Klaus is extremely powerful and catchy whenever he sings any ballads. So Lorelei and the other ballad sounded nice, but nothing extra ordinary. The previous album Humanity had number of songs that I would consider great (Humanity, Game of Life, Love Will Keep Us Alive), but on this album - full of boring stuffs. I only hope that (and have a feeling too) Scorpions will release another album sometime in 2012/2013. By the way, the only song that I thought was really good in this album is - Good Die Young.  But anyway, thanks again Scorpions. You are my all time favorite band and you would always be.
B002WYH5N2|5.0|I love the movie.  Was just wondering what's on this 2 disc edition.  All the reviews seem to be for the blu-ray, not this edition.
B001BWTVNS|5.0|...I wouldn´t say that like a new record, but slighty better than the same remaster pressed everywhere else since the 90s. Of course it has a miniature everything too...and yes, \\"the cough\\" is there.
B001G60FVG|4.0|Beautiful story that keeps you involved through to the last page, but it doesn't really leave anything with you.
0393072231|5.0|The Big Short is a refreshing insight into the sub-prime mortgage business and the subsequent meltdown, which led to the 2008 financial crash.  Just a few hedge funds (Cornwall,  Frontpoint and Scion) along with Deutche Bank took short positions on sub-prime bonds.  This is not just dry material.  The book includes real characters like the reclusive Mike Burry at Scion and the effusive Steve Eisman at Frontpoint.  Interactions between the key parties, laced with racy text highlight the real drama between the traders.<br />We know the story well.  But, what went on inside the large banks and brokerage houses,  such as Lehman Bros, Morgan Stanley Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Bear Sterns and Citibank along with insurer AIG?  Did anyone know what they were doing?  Or were they were blinded by the huge profits made on bonds and the credit default swaps.  Greg Lippmann at Deutsche Bank figured out both sides of the game.<br />Meanwhile Congress and the regulators were asleep at the switch.  It is amazing that the CEOs atop the machine had no methodology to forecast the upcoming doomsday event.<br />About my only criticism of this book, is the lack of an index and some appendices for reconstructing who worked where and interacted with whom.<br />A movie?  HBO series? Should be terrific!
0765360969|5.0|I first picked up the book at my brother's recommendation.  Usually, he's spot on and this time he didn't fail in that.  This book was exactly to my tastes and far more intriguing than I had first imagined.    The main character, Vin, was a real person and not just a character.  She drew me in.  She made me laugh and panic in turns.  I found myself agreeing with her, though she was later wrong.  And I stood in wonderment at her abilities, though the concepts of her power were new to me.  All the characters were this way, even the ones who didn't seem to matter still had a voice and a face.    One thing I didn't appreciate was that we had to wait so long to learn what some things were.  But by the time I learned them, the delay made more sense.  I suppose it was just frustration in wanting to know everything all at once and at Vin's reticence.  At the very least, holding back made sure that I would keep reading just to learn all the different metals and what a \\"kandra\\" was.  Yet there was no chance of that being the only reason to stick around.    Every time I got to a new part of the book my heart would stop and I'd glance at the clock to determine if I really needed all 8 hours of sleep or if I could make do with 2-3.  It was enthralling, to say the least.  And absolutely worth staying awake for.    This was one of the best books I've read in a while and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|Worth the wait to get all episodes in one collection. The book of artist drawings was a nice and unexpected addition.
B002VECM6S|4.0|There are some movies where you see the preview and you know exactly what to expect.  You can script out the dialogue yourself before you ever even get in the car for your drive to the theater.  Then there are other movies that surprise the hell out of you.  \\"The Blind Side\\" falls somewhere in-between but what took me off guard is the superb acting, injected with several humorous moments and the way the story touched your heart.  While I am sure to get lambasted for the next statement all I can say is bring some Kleenex because the movie while somewhat predictable is a tear jerker and exceptionally well done.<br /><br />Michael Oher, played by QUINTON AARON. is from the projects.  His mother is a drug addict with kids from more fathers than she can remember.  Her main goal in life is simply to find enough money to get the next fix and she has trouble even remembering her children's name let alone where they might currently be living.  Michael spends his time hopping form one couch to another and if he can't find a place to crash he sleeps on the street.  By luck of the draw he finds his way into a private all white Christian school and not long after gets kicked out of his current house.<br /><br />Leigh Anne Tuohy, played superbly by Sandra  Bullock is a bossy, no non-sense rich house wife.  She is strong willed to the point and doesn't spend a lot of time with the softer side of life.  She has a heart but she doesn't let it get in the way of her goal and the direction she has taken to get there.  By chance she sees Michael walking along the side of the road one night in shorts and a polo shirt in the rain.  It is freezing cold and she attempts to figure out why he is not at home with his family.  At that point she takes him into her house and her family reluctantly agrees.  With her iron clad ruling I am not sure her husband had a choice but she placates him at times with the thought that he might.<br /><br />There are several great lines in the movie but two that stand out for polar opposite reasons are:  Sandra Bullock at one point states that it isn't she who is making such a difference in Michael's life as much as it is he who is changing hers.  With his lumbering huge frame and raw physical power he is nothing more than a big soft teddy bear.  He is gentle with the kids, loves helping people and quite to the point of reclusive.  He comes across as a genuine product.  My girlfriend's favorite line is when Sean Tuohy, played by Tim McGraw says \\"I never thought I would have a black child before I met a Democrat\\".  You roll in the floor laughing at that one.<br /><br />Michael Oher might possess a natural athletic ability but he does not naturally like violence.  It takes him a while before he figures out the game of football but once he does he excels instantly with his innate talent.  The sports aspect plays a key role and with the story being based on the true life experiences it is amazing when you see Michael play on Sunday mornings for the Baltimore Ravens.  He ended up being a first round draft pick.<br /><br />The story is more about two worlds colliding and what we, who are a little more well off than others, can do to help if we open our hearts and our minds.  Color has always been a dividing point in our nation since the first slaves were shipped here from Africa.  One can only hope that with the first black President and the softening that has occurred over time we might as a nation finally be ready to set aside our prejudices and accept people for who they are as people versus their ethnicity.<br /><br />So bottom line, I loved the movie.  It was hard not to show the tears streaming down my cheek as I casually wiped them away.  It is a heartwarming, well acted, excellently directed production.  A perfect feel good story for the holidays that will hopefully spur some extra giving this year.  I strongly recommend seeing it if you can pull yourself away from the high octane action flicks and or vampire movies fora couple of hours.  You will not regret it.
B00005V9IJ|3.0|In this movie, Tom Hanks plays a corrupt FedEx worker who gets his comeuppance after he opens several FedEx packages that do not belong to him while en route to an overseas FedEx delivery. He opens packages and steals the following items from trusting FedEx customers: A pair of ladies figure skates, a volleyball, a dress, and a bunch of video tapes.   He ends up delivering only one of the packages that he was supposed to deliver, and it takes more than four years to make the delivery.     I don't want to spoil the ending, so I'll let you find out for yourself how he gets his comeuppance.
B002VECMAE|1.0|Has George Clooney ever made a truly good movie?  I know we have millions of women who love this man and granted he is a nice looking dude but I am just asking.  Can anyone name a movie that George Clooney has made that was actually successful?  Everyone points to the Ocean's movies and granted they were decent and very successful.  What we forget is those were not George Clooney movies.  There were about 15 stars in the series.  If I remember correctly Brad Pitt and Matt were fantastic.  Their characters were the two that pulled the movie above mediocrity.<br /><br />\\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" was a disappointment.  I think the premise held a lot of hope but the final product fell short.  I don't want to slam the movie as it did have a few laughs here and there but you came out thinking two things.  One, the movie could have been about 80 minutes shorter, there was just no substance and two what in the hell?  A comedy should make you laugh out loud not snicker.  A comedy should have you trying to quiet down not have you attempting to stay awake.<br /><br />The story is focused on the military and it's obsession with ESP or psychological warfare.  As you might imagine the army struggles with the concept and flails about in numerous situations trying to keep up with the Russians.  A movie with Ewan McGregor, Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges and George Clooney should have been so much better.  That is too much star power to waste wandering around the desert trying to find a goat.  Not that you couldn't make a move about finding a goat, but please dear God, make it funny.<br /><br />I admittedly would have passed on seeing this movie since I didn't have high expectations.  I go back to my first statement challenging anyone to tell me the name of even one good George Clooney movie.  My girlfriend wanted to see it and since she is not always excited about going to the theaters, I jumped at the chance and we headed out.  She as with most women, love the aging actor.  Again, I agree he is good looking, has a hypnotizing voice but can't seem to parlay this into an entertaining night at out the cinema.<br /><br />Bottom line is, I would pass on this one even as a rental.  There are so many movies out there that one should see ahead of this.  It just isn't worth the time.g, has a hypnotizing voice but can't seem to parlay this into an entertaining night at out the cinema.    Bottom line is, I would pass on this one even as a rental.

B002VPE1B6|4.0|Amazingly visual.  Stunningly vivid scenery.  Avatar takes you to a world that washes away the memory of skyscrapers and concrete.  I am guessing that the 3D depiction will change the way we watch movies in the future.  There is already plethora of 3D follow ups scheduled and it wouldn't surprise me to see more hit the drawing board.  If you have not seen Avatar I don't only suggest you see it in 3D, I insist.  I can't imagine sitting through the 2 hours and 40 minutes without the pleasure of the lifelike background.  The movie makes you feel as if you were in the woods basking in the color of the surreal make believe land name Pandora.<br /><br />Now that we have the positives out of the way we can take a gander at the movie.  James Cameron must have spent so much time on the 3D special affects that we lost a little attention on the storyline and directing.  The movie isn't bad it just wasn't epic.  The feel of the action didn't come anywhere close to the groundbreaking backdrop that was so amazingly colorful.  You basked in the new plant life and admired the animals in all of their glory and in doing so your focus left the actors allowing you to miss some of the necessary subtleties.  I guess one of the negatives of 3D is deciding where to focus the camera and in such the attention of the audience as the scene plays out.<br /><br />Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a man without legs.  He happens to be the twin brother of an Avatar scientist but his brother was killed a week before he was scheduled to head out on the adventure of a lifetime.  Jake being a twin shared the same DNA and he was asked to fill in his brothers shoes.  Making an Avatar is expense.  Avatars are genetically grown replicas of the indigenous life forms from the planet.  By linking your mind to the Avatar you can control it as if you were inside of it.  For Jake Sully, a man with no legs, it gave him back his freedom.  His ability to move, to run, to jump, to live life as he had before his spine was snapped like a stick.<br /><br />Jake jumped into the facade full force and in his first assignment loses his way in the woods and is rescued by the princess of a nearby tribe.  As you can imagine the two get acquainted, there is a bad guy, the bad guy tries to blow things up and the princess' dad is killed.  Jake does the unthinkable and above all odds leads the tribe in a war against the corporation.  The plot is basic and the storyline is nothing that we have not seen a hundred times before.  Again the differentiation of this movie versus anything I have ever seen before is the fantastical depiction of a world that is as vivid as your imagination.  I wonder if we will lose track of books given the movies can do a better job at fantasy than our own imagination.<br /><br />The message that is underlining the entire film is our world and the natural resources that we squander so readily.  The people of this planet are unique in that they connect through their hair to animals, plants, trees, and life all around them.  Everything is one.  You don't kill if you don't need to.  You don't waste life or water or energy of any kind.  All creatures are coexisting and living together using what is needed and sharing resources.  I am guessing that Mr. Cameron is a big fan of recycling.  The movie drove home the point but then again I am a fan of recycling as well so I understood the message from the beginning.<br /><br />If you are going to see just one movie this year I would suggest Avatar be the one.  While the story is basic the film itself will be discussed for the next two decades as the catalyst for redefining the theater experience.  I am curious how they will work the DVD sales and if they will ship glassed out with the movie.  I don't even know if you can watch 3D on normal TV but it is the only way that this movie should be viewed.  Interesting movie, adequate action, decent storyline and a visual experience like nothing I have ever seen before.  Highly recommend paying the ticket fee and seeing this one in a very large theater.eing this one in a very large theater.

B00337KM2S|5.0|I admittedly am a George Clooney basher.  Not that I spend much time or effort in doing so, but every time I review something he has a hand in making, I am always wondering what the uproar is about this guy.  He makes mediocre films at best and can't take a lead role in anything really worth watching.  That was until \\"Up in the Air\\".  This was a damn good movie.  Let me get that out of the way right up front.  George Clooney was fabulous in this picture.  Ryan, his character, was made for George Clooney to beautifully portray.<br /><br />The film focuses on Ryan, whose primary job is firing people.  There appears to be too many people in management lacking the balls to extinguish their employees, so they hire Ryan and his company to fly in and do the job for them.  I happen to agree with the management lacking balls statement personally as well, but what do I know.  So Ryan flies in, cuts the driftwood and flies home.......  Well that is the interesting part.  He doesn't actually fly home, since he is on the road almost every day of every week of every month of every year.  He has no real home to fly to.<br /><br />As with all misguided corporate flailing, Ryan's company hires a fledgling out of college who thinks that she can cut costs by firing people remotely, via web conference.  I love this.  How cathartic is corporate America becoming.  So Natalie brilliantly played by Anna Kendrick, sets out to learn the ropes from Ryan all the while setting up her cost saving death by video scenario.  In addition to tutoring young Natalie in the ways of death dealing, Ryan has found his love interest in the form of Alex, played by Vera Farmiga.  Possibly the one woman in the world as superficial as he is.<br /><br />As with all lonely lost souls the second Ryan opens his heart it is crushed underfoot.  He might have found his only true calling, is a lonely existence, helping pathetic corporate America cut loose its dead weight.  It is a sad story showing how lonely we are as individuals even while we are engulfed by superficial relationships everywhere we turn.  How many people truly know us?  How many people care about who we are as individuals?  Where is the one or two true friends who help make our lives worth living?<br /><br />If you only see a handful of movies each year, you really need to make \\"Up in the Air\\" one of them.  Hats off to Mr. Clooney for finally making a fantastic movie that gets you thinking, gives you hope, and crushes your sensitivity all at the same time.we are engulfed by superficial relationships everywhere we turn.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|BEST Batman movie ever!  Especially on Blu Ray disc.  This is a must have for your Blu Ray dvd collection.  The action sequences and glass shattering sound will keep you entertained for many \\"Knights\\" to come.    The sequel to the \\"Batman Begins\\" film (which I have reviewed) takes the storyline to a whole new level of mayhem.  The new villain of the series, The Joker, marvelously played by non-other than Heath Ledger who was nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal in this film.    In \\"The Dark Knight\\" Batman struggles to keep his indentity among his late night ventures as Gotham City's hero.  He faces his toughest battle yet against a nearly psychotic menace who plots to tear down the city and reveal the true identity of Batman in the process.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|There are some movies that must, that demand to be seen in the theater.  g2012 is one of those movies.  If you like action, and I mean a lot of action then this is a movie that you will want to take a non-stop, hold on to your armrests look at.  John Cusack is one of my favorite actors.  They guy can flat out make you believe he is whatever happens to be called upon in whatever scene he is playing out.  I canft remember him ever doing a big budget flat out action packed thriller before but he continues his impressive run at being a mainstream A player in Hollywood.<br /><br />The movie as with most gdisaster moviesh has the world ending as we know it.  The issue is discovered in 2009 with earth predicted to hit global destruction a few years into the future.  As with most scientific discoveries it takes the government a while to read and decipher the data but once they do they make a pack with as many countries as possible to prepare for the impending doom.  In a realistic framework, the presiding officials sell off seats to the highest bidders and then use the money to fund the massive project.  China builds the ships as it is the only country that can employ its citizens for slave labor without drawing attention.  The subtle political tones of the movie are interesting if you look at them.<br /><br />John Cusack plays a struggling writer who has managed to sell a few hundred copies of some books (I can relate to this one personally) and drives a limousine as his day job.  He is divorced and his wifefs new husband drives a Porsche.  Damn, those new husbands always have money donft they.  Through a series of random events he finds himself in the middle of figuring out what is going on and attempts to get his family to the safety zone reserved for the rich elite.  I can only say it is a good thing that luck was on his side because the dude almost bit the bullet about 1,000 times in the span of over two hours.<br /><br />The visual graphics were amazing.  Buildings toppling with the people inside free falling through the structure and out the side.  Bridges collapsing and boats toppling.  You find your eyes constantly drawn to the details as you focus on a poor sap that didnft make the main billing as he gets squashed by some large structure.  It is one thing to focus on a disaster movie; it is a completely different aspect when you see the details of what that disaster is causing.  It somehow makes it personal while at the same time cataclysmic.<br /><br />With the limited time to build the path to safety there are only a select few who will make it to the new world alive.  This is where you touch on some of the personal stories and it allows the actors a little freedom to convey their talent.  Just so we are clear, the acting is fine in the movie but the movie is not about acting.  The script is smart and well done, action is first rate, the visual effects are Oscar worthy and the overall production and editing were nicely pulled together.<br /><br />I am pretty cynical so it isnft that often I say there is a must see action packed movie.  This is one.  Get off your ass and go to the theater.  You will enjoy the movie.  Once it hits the DVD/Blue Ray arena it will lose a lot of its big screen appeal.  It isnft like you are doing anything tonight anyway so you might as well enjoy a good stress filled two hours watching a normal guy evading death, protecting his little kids and ex-wife.nside free falling through the structure and out the side.

B00275EGX8|1.0|Bought this blu ray from Amazon.    The quality of the product is terrible.     1. Subtitles dont work.  2. It gets periodically stuck, right from the beginning.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|Can I start out by saying, dude, has Gerard Butler been working out or what.  Damn, when he strips naked, yes ladies he does strip naked in this movie, he looks pretty damn hot.  I don't care who points a finger at me and calls me gay, not that there is anything wrong with that.  I can now see why Gerard is linked to every woman in Hollywood.  I remember seeing PS, I Love You and the guy was just a normal bloke.  Now he is all buff and cut and stuff.  It almost makes me want to work out.  I did say almost so shut the hell up and stop laughing.<br /><br />The opening scene is a little disturbing so be warned.  Yes, I said it.  The guy who wrote the serial killer book, Duncan's Diary: Birth of a Serial Killer , just said an opening scene to a movie was disturbing.  I think the eerie part is how personally violent it was.  It seemed real.  It was vivid and close up and when the killings began it was slow and methodical.  It freaked me out a little.  The movie starts out like so many.  Clyde (Gerard Butler) is a normal dude at home with his family.  His wife is making dinner or washing dishes or something and Clyde is hanging out with his kid working.<br /><br />There is a knock on the door and Clyde answers it.  He is hit over the head with a bat, falls to the ground and his wife and child are murdered as he lays watching.  The robbers assume everyone is dead but Clyde survives.  The assistant DA (Jamie Foxx) plea bargains because that is they way our screwed up system works and the main perpetrator gets off with a couple years in prison.  He somehow pins the murders on the other guy.  Several years go by and Clyde builds up some royal constipation and at year ten, he explodes.<br /><br />He kills the robber first and then anyone and everyone who happened to be associated with the trial.  He does most of this while in prison.  How you might ask?  Well his day job was as a CIA mastermind who planned executions worldwide.  Why is it that all of these idiot thieves just happen to rob bad asses in the movies.  If they robbed a normal dude he would sit at home crying in a bottle of Vodka for a few years, hire a prostitute and die young.  Damn, that is depressing isn't it.<br /><br />Well I won't give away anything but it is a little twisted and you will be mildly amused at the outcome.  It had the potential to be a really good movie but it was lacking something that I just couldn't put my finger on.  Maybe if Clyde would have written his victims love letters and signed them all PS, I love you, I might have jumped on board.  Anyway, not a bad movie and well worth watching on DVD which is the only place you can find it now anyway.  That and OnDemand of course.n the movies.

B000LE0TGA|4.0|This is ELO's masterpiece. The 30th Anniversary remaster, however, is a disappointment. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't say exactly what the problem is or what happened. But I can say that the 2007 remaster sounds muddier than the comparatively crisp Gastwirt remaster from (I believe) 1990. As a result, the strings seem to have receded into the background. One has to wonder whether Jeff Lynne himself had something to do with this. Lynne is listed as one of the producers of the 2007 remaster, and it is well known that Lynne began to feel disenchanted with strings during the 1980's, so much so that strings are absent from ELO's 1986 album Balance of Power. I recommend finding a good used copy of Gastwirt's version which is now out of print. Failing that, the 2007 remaster is serviceable. The 2007 remaster includes three mediocre bonus tracks. One is a brief alternate vocal for \\"Wild West Hero\\" and is frankly not that interesting; another, \\"Latitude 88 North\\" sounds like a Zoom b-side.
0061537969|4.0|\\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" surprised me but not from the beginning.  It started out slow diving into the relationships of Denny (the father) with that of his wife, his daughter and Enzo (his dog).  Interestingly enough the book is written entirely from the perspective of Enzo as you get his perspective on the storyline as it develops.  I felt this was a little distracting at times and the dreamy court sequence could have been eliminated with good editing but overall I was moved by the events.  Admittedly I have three daughters so I can relate to the feelings of betrayal and abandonment that Denny must have felt when he lost his daughter.<br />  Denny is a race car driver looking for his big break and he marries into a family with money as he falls in love with Eve.  The buy a little two bedroom house, struggle to make ends meet while raising their daughter and their beloved family dog Enzo.  Unfortunately disaster strikes and Eve becomes very ill setting into play a series of events that pummel Denny left and right exhausting the reader with the constant battles this poor father faces on a daily basis.  By the end you are amazed at the fortitude Denny possess and although he falters at times he keeps pulling himself back to the fight staying true to his family.<br />  One can only hope that all fathers would have the strength to weather the storm for their children but very few of us are ever forced to prove that we can.  Denny was not so fortunate.<br />  The writing was decent and the storyline while starting off slow injected enough twists towards the middle and end raising the level of the book several notches by the time I was finished.  If you are in the mood for a teary fight about love and family and the darkness that some people can inflict told through the eyes of a dog I would highly recommend this one.  It is an easy read and casually entertaining.

B0035V35PI|4.0|Not since the \\"Kill Bill\\" movies have I seen quite this much blood with the span of two hours.  Limbs flying, blood squirting, heads being lopped off faster than I could keep up with what might be happening next.  I guess if I can't even focus quickly enough to watch the action scenes there is not a chance in hell that I would ever be capable of Ninja like movements in real life.  Good thing that my only ambition is sitting and watching the gory mutilation versus learning to be an assassin in real life.<br /><br />Ninja Assassin takes on the old legend of warriors who are bread for no other reason than killing.  Every country wants the perfect death machine so why not breed them from childhood.  That is what the 9 clans attempt to do.  The 9 clans are an old Asian myth where children are taken from their parents as toddlers and spend their early years learning the skills of killing.  They are tortured when they lose, beaten when they fail and killed if they betray any of the basic guidelines.  Leaving is not an option and running ends in extinction.  You have no choices once you enter the clan.  You cannot ever quit.<br /><br />Raizo (Rain) is one of those children.  He has a talent for the arts and a gift for weapons.  The only problem is somewhere along the way he finds his heart and can't bring himself to kill a young girl even after being ordered to.  He turns on his clan and that just doesn't add up to anything good.  He is joined by a young Interpol agent (insert smoking hot partner here) and she aids him the best a librarian can.  Between the two of them they take on the group of killing machines who sniff them out like a pack of wolves.<br /><br />\\"Ninja Assassin\\" is all about action.  There is not a lot of cast chemistry, no romantic ties and little real acting.  It is all about as many gruesome deaths that you can pack into a two hour span.  If you like action movies and hate anything else other than action this is a movie for you.  I tend to like a little balance at times so left the theater short on satisfaction.  That being said I did enjoy the movie just felt it would have been nice to even attempt something slightly more.<br /><br />It is a great movie to see with the guys but I would not bring my girlfriend or wife with you unless she is as close to a dude as she can be without jumping over the fence to the other side.

B000VDDWDS|5.0|Recently I saw some critic's best-of lists from the Noughties, and I was very surprised that none of them included this work. This is not only one of the best of the last decade, but one of my favorite films of all time. I can literally watch it over and over again and never feel bored by it. Yes, as another reviewer mentioned, it does require some work in that many technical terms are used and never explained, and the level of period detail verges on the neurotic- but this is part of what makes it great.
0688163173|2.0|Promising (I bought it because of the very positive reviews and the promise of a shocking finale) and disappointing, written as if its only purpose was to have enough turns and breaks and cheap thrills to make an average noir movie - which it eventually led to. A good summer read - if that means anything - but that's about it. Agatha Christie made them better - and shorter - 50 years ago....I'd better focus on the classics next time.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Seven-year-old Lavinia McCarten becomes an orphan when her parents die on their voyage to America to seek a better life, and she becomes an indentured servant to a tobacco plantation owner. As a result, to learn a trade, she is placed in the care of the slaves at the plantation's kitchen house, an area separated from the \\"big house\\" to isolate smells, heat, and the threat of fire. Eventually, she becomes enmeshed in the family of the plantation owner and goes from servant to mistress of the plantation. Can she suddenly change her feelings for and treatment of the slaves who raised her? And are the relationships between slave and master more intimate than they appear?    I see three types of slavery in this book--African plantation slave, white indentured servant, and a slave of an abusive marriage. As I was reading, I sometimes felt I was reading a watered-down version of Mandingo, but I did enjoy the story. It was interesting to realize that the master/slave relationship that is familiar in connection with the pre-Civil War period was already in effect in the book's time period--late 1700s and early 1800s.    The author said that she first wrote the black characters' accents with a much heavier dialect; however, she later smoothed this out after deciding it was too difficult to read. Because the speech was so similar in Belle and Lavinia's narrations and they were interacting with the same people, I sometimes found it difficult to remember which one was telling the story and often had to go back to the chapter heading to see if the speaker was Belle or Lavinia.    I especially enjoyed the Williamsburg years. The author did her research, even to the description of the bright paint colors used in the early homes. Having been to Williamsburg, I've seen the evidence of those colors when the old walls have been stripped down to their original colors.    The ending lacked closure. It would have been nice to know more about Lavinia's later life; unfortunately, the story stopped rather abruptly with few details.

1892065304|5.0|This book covers so much ground with so many people and yet by the first 50 pages you should have the characters down. If not there is a simple glossary in the back that tells you exactly what you'd need to know to follow the story and nothing else. The graphic depictions of sex, violence, and honest language give the book a fresh feel for fantasy that is oft missing for fear of offending readers. No character is safe which brings about true nail biting tension as to what will happen. Pick it up for this book if not the series as a whole.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|This one of the funnier movies I've seen in a while - and believe me, I've suffered through hundreds of pathetic comedies.[[ASIN:B00005JL7Q About a Boy]] is really about two boys: Hugh Grant, a rich, lazy heir, and Nicholas Hoult, the son of a suicidal single mom. It has its serious moments, but overall it's a great laugh. I love the way the movie reads into the minds of Grant and Hoult - it adds a whole new layer of comedy, allowing the characters to add sarcasm to the scene without making the movie unrealistic. The script is great. Hugh Grant's lines seem perfectly suited for the moment. My favorite is when Hugh Grant's character learns the value of of charity: \\"I made an unhappy boy temporarily happy. And there wasn't anything in it for me at all - I didn't even want to shag his mom.\\" Brilliant!
B002T45VX6|1.0|I'm the biggest Shakira fan there is and I am not Hispanic, I hunted down Pies Descalzos without thinking twice, I grabbed Donde Estan los Ladrones off the shelf without hesitation and without having heard a single note from it (and I was not sorry), the disappointment started creeping in after Laundry Service and I thought it peaked after hearing the English-language version of the Oral Fixation. Boy, was I wrong! This latest album, She Wolf, is a genuine piece of garbage, I even turn the radio off in the car when they play songs from it. There is no musicality in it, zero, zip, nada, it sounds like a bad karaoke.  Shakira has a wonderful voice and is otherwise an excellent composer (and dancer, etc., etc.), is probably very intelligent, she has no reason for polluting her career with such creations, and she has no reason for associating herself with black rap music (which sounds like, well, black rap music).  I did myself a favor and stopped expecting anything good from Shakira a long time ago, and I have to admit that sometimes I am totally surprised/impressed: when she puts her real musical talent to work, she IS the greatest singer on the planet. She Wolf, however, is a disaster, it's a shame, kid.

B001SGEUNI|3.0|If this review comes off sounding overly negative, it is more as a balance to the litany of 5 star reviews.  The three star rating seems about right, you'll enjoy this album, but it is fairly disposable and certainly not a classic.<br /><br />The riffs are mostly good and Lzzy Hale the vocalist also has good rock pipes.  The drumming is a bit stock and fades into the background, but it isn't distractingly bad.  Sadly, instead of just making a straight up rock album, Halestorm decided to make an over produced powerpop album.  This makes every lyric, every growl and every scream seem calculated for maximum radio play rather than part of the songwriting process.<br /><br />Every song is either a breakup song or a sex song, probably quite calculated by the fact that the lead singer is attractive.  But while one or two of these songs would be fine, when it becomes a whole album, it falls into self parody.  The penultimate song, \\"Dirty Work,\\" actually plays like a reworking of Spinal Tap's \\"Sex Farm.\\"<br /><br />Let me be your labor of love<br />My royal garden needs a hired man<br />Plant your seed, darlin'<br />My roses are in your hands<br /><br />GET IT?<br /><br />Too much of the album is spent on cultivating Hale's bad girl image as well.  A song about wanting to take your innocence, a song about not being an angel, song about not being the girl you expected and this from the opening track:<br /><br />Read my finger whatcha gonna do?<br />See these lips are all done talkin' to you<br />I don't mean to bruise your ego<br />But I've had you nailed down for so long<br />And I don't see your name on my tattoo<br /><br />Oy, we get it, we get it.<br /><br />There is fun to be had with this album, but don't take it too seriously.  And don't expect Lacuna Coil, it isn't that inventive.
B0035V35P8|5.0|After skipping theatres in Australia and probably a few other countries, I ordered Ninja Assassin as soon as it became available. After watching it, I can say that I am even more disappointed that it was decided to have this as a direct-to-DVD title as it is easily the best martial arts movie I have seen to come from Hollywood. Director James McTeigue and producers Joel Silver and the Wachowskis have crafted the most entertaining movie of all their careers yet.   The biggest surprise here is Korean pop star Rain, who underwent a complete transformation to portray killing maching Raizo, which he does ever so well. Not only does he handle his fight sequences and stunts, he is a very able and convincing actor and in my opinion has a very bright future in action/martial arts films should he choose this direction.   If you're a fan of this type of genre, it doesnt get much better than this. The action choreography is sharp and crisp, thanks to an A squad stunt team consisting of Chad Stahelski, Jon Valera and Peng Zhang to name a few. Crank it up as well because the sound design and editing is of the highest standard and quality.    I have been a martial arts fan and student for close to 2 decades and I am very picky when it comes to the quality of action and the performer, there are not many credible martial arts actors out there anymore now that many of them are starting to slow it down (Jet Li and Jackie Chan for example), but now my hopes have risen because there's a new kid on the block, he's gonna kick some serious arse, and his name is Rain.    BRING ON THE SEQUEL!!!!!!!

His therapist suggested trying \\"holding time.\\" We had the first session in his office and it has worked wonders. While he showed me just he basics the change in one weekend has been remarkable. I can't wait to get the book and read it in its entirety.
B00001W9G0|4.0|I purchased the movie to add to my DVD collection.  I saw it when it came out at the movie theater several years ago.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever, but its not for everyone. Most of my friends didn't pick up the deeper meanings within it. Very blunt, not for kids!
1400082773|5.0|I loved this book! I'm so glad he wrote it before attempting public office because it was an honest expression of his experiences and beliefs. I think many things would have been left out if he had considered possible future consequences. However, by leaving them in there were no skeletons in his closet. This book was interesting to me because it was the true story of a man with a very unusual life. Even if he had never been president it would have been a fascinating book!
B001OQCV6K|4.0|If your idea of Sherlock Holmes comes from the Jeremy Brett, British TV series of the 1980s and 1990s or perhaps from the series of films starring Basil Rathbone, Director Guy Ritchie gives us a Holmes reinvented for the 21st century.  Now ordinarily hearing how a character has been reinvented or re-imagined might send you screaming out of the theater but such is not the case with \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role.  While modernizing the feel of the character, Ritchie also embraces the original vision of author Arthur Conan Doyle perhaps more than any other adaptation.<br /><br />As described by Dr. John Watson in Doyle's original texts, Holmes was an expert boxer, swordsman, and master of the \\"singlestick\\" a martial arts form utilizing a wooden stick, such as a walking stick, as a weapon.  Holmes was also versed in a form of Japanese wrestling he referred to as \\"Baritsu\\".  Ritchie embraces these aspects of the character to full effect, with Holmes relying on his fists almost as much as his mind.  And while not actually stated, Holmes' addiction to cocaine, legal at the time in England, is hinted at strongly.<br /><br />The film opens with a bang with Holmes and Watson (Jude Law) are on the trail of the man responsible for the ritual murders of several women in 1891 London.  The killer is revealed as the prominent Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is captured and hanged, but not before he gives Holmes an ominous warning.  Three days later, Blackwood's tomb is destroyed from the inside and the groundskeeper tells the local constables that he saw Blackwood returned to life.  Holmes and Watson, along with sometimes Holmes love interest Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) work to uncover the secret behind Blackwood's dark arts before he can make good on his threat to kill the members of the House of Lords and plunge England into chaos.<br /><br />As mentioned this is a different Holmes than were used to seeing but in many ways the most faithful to Conan Doyle's stories.  He is arrogant and enjoys figuring out things that befuddle the police but he is basically a loner outside of friendship with Watson.  His demeanor is cold as his penchant for observation and deduction is off-putting to most other people.  And yet you can see his reliance and affection for Watson as the grounding figure in his life.  When Watson announces his impending marriage to Mary Morstan, Holmes is clearly jealous.  Downey and Law have a wonderful chemistry...their scenes together are filled with witty and often humorous repartee.<br /><br />Ritchie has created a remarkable vision of Victorian London in all its glory and seediness.  You can almost smell the stale water along the banks of the Thames and feel the chill of the air along Baker Street.  The remarkable set pieces and visual effects bring this period of London to life and it is as big a star as Downey Jr. or Law.<br /><br />While purists may be turned off by the extensive action sequences and CGI, this is a film meant to thrill rather than intrigue.  Holmes still goes about solving mysteries but he's more a man of action than we've seen in previous depictions.  One note of concern is that a rather large sub-plot is left open, obviously hinting sequel.  The film certainly did well enough to warrant a follow-up but with Downey's involvement with the Iron Man and Avengers films, who knows when Holmes might be revisited.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Extras<br /><br />Maximum Movie Mode.

B0009RJVI6|4.0|This was a very engaging book - hard to put down.  That being said, I think it was too forced.  Everything was wrong with Kevin - there were three million and three signs - I would have liked to see a more complex character - more like Eva (the mother).
0307454541|5.0|Great book you should read it!  Love Amazon, too! Great service and the used books are what the description says it will be.<br />3
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one of the best miniseries I have ever seen and experienced...you don't just see this film you take it in and experience each moment as it happens. I think it is now my alltime favorite war film. I can't see one thing I would have changed about this fine film. The performances were totally engrossing and the intense and varied action was so engaging; also suspenseful. One truly felt the chaois present in a battle and the subsequent 'thoughtful' moments were just stunning...they stopped me in dead my tracks and I still think and ponder on those profound and poignant moments in the film. Attention to detail was wonderful. Some key moments I don't want to reveal here, because I think this would spoil the film for others. I borrowed this fine set from a friend and so far, within a two month period, I have watched the entire production (including extras) three times. I could easily watch it again many times over. Everytime I watched it, I felt more involved and more understanding and appreciative of the individual men who fought, against all odds, for our freedom. I was totally engaged with the characters and got to know them even better than my first viewing, by my third. I am eternally grateful to all of these brave men, ones that lived to tell the story and ones who died in battle. Survivors suffered much and they had great fortitude. I would like to thank them all personally...everyone one of them were heros! Richard Winters, in real life, was much too modest, (in the documentary) when he said he was not a hero, to his grandson, but rather he served with a company of heros. He was exempletory in his leadership skills; he cared about his men and he no doubt, saved countless lives by his wise judgement. Damien Lewis did a fine job playing Dick Winters. The entire cast was well chosen and very believable as the characters they portrayed; all performances were extraordinary. I can't say enough about this film. It is well worth owning. The set is beautiful and very well done. It's well worth the investment. Beautiful score as well. I heard the lyrics to the main theme recently and they are wonderful as well....very uplifting. I am considering buying the score.
B000QEIOTO|5.0|I received my dvd immediately and was in good condition.  Great service.  Thank you.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Very original and funny. The kind of show you can re-watch when you just need some relaxing time. You quickly become attached to the characters. Great show!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have a fairly large collection of workout DVDs, and have never in my life experienced anything as efficient as The Shred.  I was dead tired and ready to collapse in the middle of my first workout, but oddly enough Jillian is really motivating, even through a TV.  The moves are tough but really work.  Make sure you give yourself room for the exercises.  She moves fast, so there's no time for a water break!    My only concern is the claim-20lbs in 30 days?  Is that possible?  We shall see...fingers crossed!
B002N5N4M6|3.0|First of all I have to say that I am a huge fan of this show. However, I also have to say this season (I believe there are 19 episodes at this point, I admit I have missed 2 of them) does not live up to the standard set by the first two 5 star worthy seasons. While Parsons and  Galecki continue to provide stellar performances, many of the scenes just feel forced. Its hard to say exactly why, but I think the writers are having trouble finding a groove with the Penny/geek quartet interactions (the core of the show, in my opinion) now that the sexual tension between Penny and Leonard has diminished. Despite this, it is still an enjoyable show to watch, but I now have doubts about its longevity. I truly hope I am proven wrong and the series runs 6+ seasons, as it has given me much enjoyment, but I think the dynamics of the first two seasons need to be recaptured for that to happen.
B002K51LXI|3.0|I bought this book because I had read that twenty-one million people had done so.<br /><br />It is erotic and violent, but has no nuanced characters and no intruiging plot. Its heroine is as cruel and filthy as her victims. Its supposed mental health content is strikingly unauthentic.<br /><br />It may appeal to vicious feminists, male sadomasochists and those who love the outrageous. Whether it portrays Sweden or not I cannot say, nor what it says about the twenty-first century.<br /><br />My interest now turns to its many favorable reviews, many quite long-winded. But that is why the book is interesting.
B000002LMK|5.0|By 1990 - when this was recorded and released - Neil Young was experiencing some kind of musical rebirth. The timing was right, the eighties thankfully left behind. His previous album Freedom -1989- had been very good but things were greatly improved on this release. Back with Crazy Horse, Ragged Glory sounds inspired, cohesive and ultimately above average. Neil's lyrics and singing are great and there are quite a few delightful backing vocals scattered throughout. It sounds perhaps like the feeling of having a great time with friends you haven't seen in a while. The band is tight and the recording has a raw, live feel to it. From start to finish this is indeed a joy to listen to and brings back much of the feeling they shared in the wonderful Days That Used To Be! So basically the only thing left to say is: Don't let this be overlooked as Neil's albums don't always come like this.
0439023491|5.0|The second book had a great plot twist which the author did a great job with subtle foreshadowing. It does leave you wanting more and I can't wait until the last. A must read especially if you enjoyed the first.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I LOVE this video.  I bought it because I have a full time job and take classes at night, so I need a quick workout that I can fit in the early mornings or evenings...the two times of the day that I'm usually the most unmotivated to workout, but I just think, it's only 20 minutes!    I'm only on level 2 and it's a huge different from level 1!  I can feel my body toning up...I haven't lost any weight, but I'm thin to begin with.  Actually I also wanted to try these videos b/c my old workouts only involved cardio and I wanted something to tone my body (I'm getting married this year).    You sweat like crazy during these 20 minutes, so have a towel handy!
0439023483|5.0|I am in the majority when I say that I could not put it down. Great read!
B0000DJZ9T|4.0|Starting 2 years ago I found out about this group named Coldplay. The first song I heard was Fix You and it had so much meaning for me I started to follow there music. I've never been to concert outside of R & B music, but there music sounds so nice I wanted to attend a Coldplay concert. I found this CD on pandora and feel in love with the Aulbum. The music was great ( band, singing, crowd, and how professional the sound was). I bought the combo box (CD, and DVD) I must say the DVD on a nice size T.V. give you the affect as if you were there in the crowd with a floor seat.     Amazon was the only place that I could find the CD & DVD combo. No walk in store had this must hear and see collection.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|This will go down in the Tippa-T history as one of the best movies I've ever seen. It was just beautiful. Half way through the movie (I saw this with my mom after a failed attempt to see this in 3D (which wasn't even necessary, it was that GREAT!!!)) I texted her this exact message: This is LOTR, Matrix good! Visually striking, has politics, philosophy, linguistics, sociology and is moving: my type of movie. I knew it woud be good, but it was better than I expected.     Definite, Enthusiastic Yes!    Note: To fully enjoy this movie, as with all other movies, don't see it with high (or any) expectations. Then it will woo you.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|I absolutely adore this album, partially for the fantastic story it tells. The first time I listened to it, I was thinking that it would be the perfect soundtrack to the book \\"1984\\" and I did an internet search on it. Turns out it was actually inspired Orwell's book! Listen closely, the album retells a great story. Read the book and you'll see. ;-)
B001OQCV6K|1.0|I watched SH today and could not wait for it to end.  An example of mediocrity overwhelming a once revered character.  Too bad.  I ordered the 12 dvd set of Sherlock Holmes that was on sale today on amazon.com so it could help erase this version of Sherlock from my memory.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This was a good movie, not much substance to it but over all a good retell of a famous story. It's not often you see the owner die before the animal most movies the animal dies and the owner is sad.     The crazyest thing about this whole movie is that I have a cat named Hachi! I did not know anything about this movie or the story of Hachi-Ko when I named my cat over two years ago. I love the Japanese language and when I went to adopt him his coller had the number 82 on it to tell him apart from the other kittens and he was the last one in the bunch so I adopted him and the number in Japanese is Hachi-ju-ni so that is his full name but we just call him Hachi! I couldn't believe it. I had never heard of that name for an animal before! I thought I had an original name, guess not so much!     Enjoy this movie for the story because it is a very heart warming story!
B002WY65W4|5.0|This film is great if you are looking for a just plain fun film to watch. Otherwise, you may be disappointed.
0316069906|5.0|This book was an absolute life-changer. I first heard of this book when Jonathan Foer was on the Daily Show w/ Jon Stewart. I had never heard of him before but was intrigued by his book and the discussion between him and Jon Stewart. I had always been a HUGE animal lover but still ate chicken/beef/fish etc. After reading this book and watching Food INC (by a different person), I am never ever going to eat animals again. I LOVE the taste of it but my appetite is not more important than the suffering of animals. PLEASE take a look at this book. Even if you don't buy it, try to find it at your local library. I wish everyone could get their hands on this book and just read it once. Thank you Jonathan for your wonderful, eye-opening book.
B002YIHO7I|1.0|Been a long time fan of Sade since her first album. Very unhappy with this CD and only semi-like two songs. In fact giving the CD to my girlfriend who might like it better as hate for it to gather dust! Telling my age because my #1 favorite CD is with songs \\"Is It A Crime\\", \\"Jezebel\\" and \\"Punch Drunk\\". But, also bought her 1994 Live In Concert DVD last week which is EXCELLENT and highly recommend for any Sade fan from the early years!
B000AQJPQE|5.0|Great toy and great for kids room too. And they get to learn about planets at the same time.<br />I just thought that it should have had better and brighter light in it and if it would have been more easier to fix.
0393072231|4.0|Lewis has a clear and concise style and does a great job of describing the lead up to financial melt-down using the personal stories of a handful of investors who saw what was coming before most others.  At a little over 250 pages, it is not too long (I wish it were longer in spots) and the writing is engaging and often quite funny.  It was hard to put down, so I finished it in just a few days.  It may not be the definitive book on how and why the subprime mortgage market sank the financial system, but it is a very readable and informative account of what was  happening behind the headlines.
B000002BQK|5.0|let me tell you something about my hero, She has had a tuff road as a child, but even as a superstar, she was married to her producer, Tommy matola, who was very controling, and expected mariah to be his slave, So She struggled and was miserable for 3-4 years of her life, and the only thing she enjoyed doing was writing music and singing for her fans, after her amazing success of daydream, mariah left her husband and her rich home to move on and produce herself, it was a huge step for her, and i love this women from the bottom of my heart, This album her butterfly was a let go of her husband, and an album that showed all of her emotions, Which also was complete success, So Now my hero, is kicking butt with career, And a must own for a mariah FAN.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|When I first saw this at Costco, I was bound and determined to buy the series.  But due to financial constraints, I withheld my impulse.<br /><br />Then years later, I found it on sale on Amazon for almost 1/2 the price.  I couldn't believe it!  If you are a fan of this show, this is a must buy.<br /><br />I was very disappointed that there wasn't closed captioning for the movies.  I could have sworn it wasn't closed captioned for the shows either.<br /><br />I have an old TV that doesn't have captions.  But if that doesn't bother you, this will do just fine.<br /><br />The great thing for me was that the two movies were given in this set!
B0035G9ABQ|4.0|For a lot of reasons, this album garners a lot of unpopular opinions as either being the Best or the Worst Gorillaz release to date.     Now, I'm not the kind to judge a CD through its first listen-through, and I'll admit that the stylings on some of these new tracks can be a little out there for Gorilla regulars; but over time I had eventually grown to love them for their own musical qualities. Not that I have deliberately tried to like this album through countless listenings; it's just that a lot of the tunes found on Plastic Beach some how manage to get a different hook through my head every morning I wake up. Whether it'd be the bass-thumpings of \\"Stylo\\", the synth build of \\"Empire Ants\\" or the melodic chimes of \\"On Melancholy Hill\\", there's always something that'll bring you back to wanting to experiencing the album in its entirety over & over again. Even \\"Sweepstakes\\"... probably THE definitive love-to-hate track on the album doesn't cease to amaze me once the horns kick in . . .You're a Winner.

0143038419|5.0|Ms. Gilbert is an educated, skeptical, rational, well-informed person who lives in a secular culture.  In all these ways, Ms. Gilbert is like me.  But unilke me, she found a way to God.  This book made me want to develop my own meditation practice.   It didn't make me want to spend 4 months learning to speak Italian while eating gelato in Rome (I go to Italy often, where I eat well and practice my language skills), nor did it make me want to fall in love in Bali (I am happily married to my best friend, and have been for 15 years).  Italian language, Italian food, and love are not missing from my life, nor is travel.  But I would really, really like to be able to meditate.      Ms. Gilbert writes compellingly and persuasively about her own spiritual journey, starting out as a woman who can't sit still for even a few minutes, and who can't say no to the distractions of her own thoughts for five seconds, and ending as  woman who frequently experiences the divine within herself and can peacefully sit and mediate for four or five hours at a stretch.  Meditation is, by its nature, unevenful, so it's not an easy topic for narrative, but Ms. Gilbert writes about the frustration, joy, and revelation she experiences along the way in an exciting and inspiring way.      Part of what is helpful is that she has no need to convert he reader.  She's not trying to sell you on her method or her guru's.  She's just reporting her own progress.  Her meditation memoir made me want to change my life.    I thought the Balinese love story part of the book was less interesting, and many other people have written more helpfully about how to travel in Italy (though not many writers are as funny as Ms. Gilbert).  But the meditation journey was fascinating to me and made me want to tag along.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This is one of my favorite films.  It makes fun of some of the formulas and oversights in the whole Star Trek series.  \\"Is there air??  You don't know!!\\"  How are the Kepop Blood Tics?  \\"Just like mother used to make.\\"<br /><br />My wife and I watch it every now and then for a really good laugh.  The cast is incredible and the situations couldn't be funnier.  I wish there were a sequel.  If you're a fan of Veggietales, there's a good reference to Gorignak, the rock monster, in [[ASIN:B001CK7ONS Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A Veggie Tales Movie (Full Screen)]].  Buy it, rent it, or stream it, it's worth it!
B0030IIYWA|5.0|There is nothing more that can be said about this fantastic movie and the, now current, offer available. But if you were to start at the first review listed you would notice it was from 1999 and there was no \\"Combo\\" DVD/BLU-RAY edition available then. It's a minor thing but if you shop Amazon frequently, you need to be aware that sometimes the reviews and even the product descriptions of simular products get used in other listings where the products are not always the same. Always check the \\"manufacturer's\\" description on these products.
B002YICN74|4.0|Before I caught Nick and the Administration on the Jay Leno show a while back, all I knew about the Jonas Brothers is that they are cute Disney popsters who produced generic Top 40 material.  But that encounter sent me out to buy the album, and it's a good investment.    The real key here is that Nick is smart enough to surround himself with a band built of musicians with far more experience than he has.  (Whether that was his choice or that of his label, I don't know but it's a smart one, and he should keep listening to wherever those ideas are coming from.)  Instead of Top 40 pablum, Nick moves toward blues-based rock, which is a more lasting sound.  He's got a guitarist here who really knows how to make the instrument sing, and does some decent slide guitar riffs, and  his keyboard player knows his way around a Hammond organ.  For an old rocker like me, those are always good signs.  All these things give the album a suprising heft that goes beyond Nick's 17 years.    (For the record, I'm more than 30 years his senior, and I prefer blues, classic rock and heavy metal, generally.  But this is a smart album.)      Some here make the comparison to John Mayer.  I'm not much a fan Mayer fan, and for me the most irritating thing on the album is Nick's tendency toward the breathy Mayeresque vocals.  I think, however, that may be a function of his age, and his voice not having fully matured yet.  There are other places on the album where Nick's voice shows some real grit.    Some here have been dismissive of Nick because he's only 17, and how can a 17 year-old really have the chops for good rock?  All I have to say is that Neal Schon, one of the co-founders of Journey was touring with Santana when he was 17 and still in high school.  Age has nothing to do with talent.     If Nick continues on this road he could turn into a serious musician.  We'll see what the future brings.

0061914177|2.0|Don't be fooled by the glowing reviews the author and his buddies have given themselves, there is very little actual business advice in this book.  For example, the chapter on content is less than 7 pages (of large font) long !  Suffice it to say that it brings nothing new to the table.  The author repeats the generic wisdom of the e-world without specific advice or detailed examples.  The book is extremely short and completely lacking in practical value.  He repeatedly preaches about quality of information and being an expert in your subject of choice, yet the book itself offers only unspecific, overly broad advice such as \\"build your own brand\\" (with zero details on how to do it).       The vast majority of the book is Gary pumping up his own ego, telling you how great he is and sometimes giving reasons why you probably won't be as great as him.  I laughed out loud several times at how insecure this guy is... for someone who claims to be so happy, he can't make it two pages without making a not-so-subtle reference to his own perfection.  It bothers me that this book has such great reviews when it's not worth the sticker price.
B001Q1KHUU|4.0|I don't like this as much as her first album but my 2-yr old absolutely LOVES Not Fair, especially with the video.<br /><br />Lily's awesome. Ironically now I consider Lily to be the clean one when I pick videos for my baby. Somehow Alfie smoking *bleep* seems more appropriate than Lady GaGa being licked all over. But it's important for a growing toddler to have variety so she'll get both.<br /><br />If you like Lily Allen or British comedy you will enjoy his album. If you've never heard Lily, try Alright Then first. If you do not appreciate a good mockney accent try Coldplay.
B0039UTDA6|5.0|I am really enjoying the series Life.  I think Oprah is doing a very good job, I do however love David Attenborough, so I know I would enjoy his commentary.  People seem to be a bit negative for no real good cause, Oprah is easy to listen to and she may help people see and appreciate the planet, who may not have been familiar with David Attenborough.  That in my mind is a good thing.  And, as the lucky consumer, you get to choose who narrates the show you purchase... lucky you!  Either version should be watched.  The images are fantastic.  I hope it helps you to fall more deeply in love with this planet that we share with all sorts of extraordinary life.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Pink Floyd is perhaps the ultimate album band, but their continuing popularity ensures a large Best Of market. There had been several prior compilations, but Echoes is the first two-disc one covering their whole career. Floyd has too many great songs to fit on two discs, and their best albums are meant to be heard in full; songs often lose something - or even make no sense - out of context. Further complicating things is that Floyd's music is incredibly diverse. All compilations are thus inherently limited - and, in true fans' eyes, inherently flawed. However, Echoes does a good job of introducing Floyd and conveying their range and depth. Most of the songs played ubiquitously on radio are here, though there are some major exceptions:  \\"Breathe,\\" \\"Brain Damage/Eclipse,\\" \\"Welcome to the Machine,\\" \\"Have a Cigar,\\" \\"Young Lust,\\" \\"Run like Hell,\\" etc. However, many of the band's best songs are non-radio friendly and (almost inevitably) passed over here, \\"Dogs\\" being a prominent example, while other excellent works (e.g., \\"Free Four\\") are missing as well. Also, several of the longer songs that are included - notably \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" and \\"Echoes\\" - are heavily edited, as are some shorter ones. Both of these monoliths have nearly ten minutes removed; this arguably improves \\"Echoes,\\" but \\"Shine\\" is hopelessly crippled - a pale shadow of itself giving a drastically misleading impression of what may be the greatest song of all-time and selling it rather short. The remaining edits annoy to various extents. One can also quibble with other inclusions. There is a divide among fans between those who love the early Syd Barrett material and those who do not; the former will be glad for the inclusion of several Barrett cuts, but the latter will be annoyed that there are any. The tracks from Floyd's hotly debated last three albums are also sure to be controversial; many will wish some or none had been used. The Final Cut is the band's most debated album; many think it an overlooked masterpiece, but at least as many consider it their worst effort. I am in the former category, but \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" is not the best cut for an album like this. Others will of course have different views on these and other inclusions; compilations never satisfy everyone, but this is about as good a compromise as one could hope for.    Floyd and the other compilers certainly went out of their proverbial way to make Echoes worthwhile. Most compilations are chronological, but this is arranged to give at least a semblance of unity; some transitions are downright shocking, but it flows pretty well overall and gives a new way of listening to tried and true favorites. This is where much of the editing comes into play - a fact that can only annoy hard-cores but that will of course not bother casuals. The cover and other packaging, overseen by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson, are also excellent. There are no previously unreleased or alternate versions to attract hard-cores, but \\"When the Tigers Broke Free,\\" written for The Wall movie and not released before on CD but later included on The Final Cut remaster, is presumably here for them as it has little value in itself. It is also worth noting that all the songs have been remastered and sound great - certainly better than early CDs - though this is also true of the remastered albums. In the end, though, one of this is in my view anywhere near reason enough to buy Echoes if one already has all or most of the albums.    As for casuals, the bottomline is that Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall are essential albums, and several others have great merit. They cost a little more, but the investment is very worthwhile.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This movie deserved its Acadamy Awards nominations.  The script is well paced, the set design and costumes are spot-on perfect, and the acting is impeccable.  Both Ruppert Friend and Emily Blunt must have researched Victoria and Albert meticulously.  It is always a privilege to see such talent and relentless dedication in the arts, especially (at least for me) when the medium is used to bring such an interesting history to life.

B003DNH6DK|5.0|One thing this movies does is makes you appreciate what you have even more.    In the movie, a young black boy is literally dumped by his dope addict mother to fend for himself at a very young age. He is seen hording food as if he may never see food again. He is also a victim of the educational system which passes him from grade to grade with no corresponding achievement. By the time the Tuohy family takes him in, he has a GPA of nearly zero, no place to live, no food and for all practical reasoning, no future. Such was the story of football great, Michael Oher. It is a touching story the whole family should watch as so many of today's kids think they have it so unbearably tough, but when compared to Michael Oher, they will see they are living on Easy Street. It is a personal triumph over incredible odds using not luck, but love and hard work.
0141000198|4.0|Written in the form of her diary, Bridget takes the reader into a year in her life as a 30 something singleton living in England who works at a publishing company. Bridget's family and certain friends keep asking her when she's finally going to settle down and marry. Bridget meets Mark Darcy, a successful, rich lawyer at a party and her mother tries to get the two together. Darcy however is a bit of a snob and dislikes Bridget right away.<br />Meanwhile, her playboy boss Daniel Cleaver, begins to send her flirty emails and the two end up having an affair. Bridget is hoping Daniel will take thier relationship seriously, but she has the distinct feeling he is cheating on her.<br /><br />I like that this book is inspired by Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice and enjoy the references throughout the book:<br />&#34;It struck me as pretty ridiculous to be called Mr. Darcy and to stand on your own looking snooty at a party. It's like being called Heathcliff and insisting on spending the entire evening in the garden, shouting &#34;Cathy&#34; and banging your head against a tree.&#34;<br /><br />This book had me laughing out loud and I could totally relate to some of the things Bridget was talking about. She isone of those heroines I think most women can relate to.<br />The film version of Bridget Jones's Diary is one of my favorites and I recommend the book for a good dose of light and fun escapism. In this case, I do prefer the film to the book. Some of my favorite scenes in the movie are not in the book, like the famous fight scene between Darcy and Daniel.

B001OQCV6K|5.0|First of all, as of this writing, Amazon still states that this item is a three disc set, but this is not the case. The DVD and digital copy are included on the same disc, while a second disc contains the Blu-Ray version. This isn't an issue, of course, just a small clarification. Speaking of which, I've seen a significant number of complaints regarding the inclusion of the DVD/digital copy in the Blu-Ray version, with many complaining that they want neither and it's needlessly driving the cost up.<br /><br />A simple comparison of this item against other Blu-Rays on Amazon proves this title costs no more than any other new release, and the DVD/digital copy is actually a very nice bonus for those who buy the film early. I, for instance, plan to loan out the DVD to friends who don't own Blu-Ray players. The digital copy is nice, I suppose, but I've never been bored enough to want to watch a film on my iPod or laptop. Besides which, like all digital copies, it expires a year from now. I'm actually glad it's included on the same disc as the DVD, because all other digital copies included on a separate disc I've ended up tossing out.<br /><br />Upon loading the Blu-Ray into the player three trailers will run. This is, of course, typical practice. The irritating part is that the disc will not allow the user to access the menu from the trailers, and the user is forced to manually fast-forward through each trailer. A minor complaint, to be sure, but irritating nonetheless. The film runs 02:08:24 and the Blu-Ray includes ten bonus features (the DVD doesn't contain a single special feature). The included audio tracks and subtitles are in English, French, and Spanish. The first eight features are all collected in the \\"Focus Points\\" section and consist of eight 3-5 minute featurettes exploring a specific facet of the film (there is a \\"Play All\\" function included). Most of the titles are rather self-explanatory, but here's a complete rundown of the featurettes:<br /><br />1) \\"Drawbridges & Doilies: Designing a Late Victorian London\\" (5:00) - This feature highlights how the production designers suffused life into their vision of Victorian London with an acute attention to detail.<br /><br />2) \\"Not a Deerstalker Cap in Sight\\" (4:15) - This feature explains how the filmmakers decided to take the Holmes character back to his roots in the original Arthur Conan Doyle tales and compare the Downey interpretation against past cinematic versions of Holmes.<br /><br />3) \\"Ba-ritsu: A Tutorial\\" (3:58) - This feature explores how the filmmakers blended various real-life martial arts into the fictional version featured in the film, along with explaining how Holmes was a former fighter well-versed in martial arts in the original Doyle stories.<br /><br />4) \\"Elementary English: Perfecting Sherlock's Accent\\" (4:04) - This feature explores how American Downey refined his English accent for the film. Director Guy Ritchie observes that he preferred an American because it gives the Holmes character an \\"international\\" flavor.<br /><br />5) \\"The One That Got Away\\" (3:44) - This feature delves a bit into the psyche of Holmes, particularly his stance on love and his relationships with women.<br /><br />6) \\"Powers of Observation & Deduction\\" (4:01) - This features Lionel Wigram (writer & producer of \\"Sherlock Holmes\\") explaining why he was attracted to the project, along with what makes Holmes such an enduringly fascinating character.<br /><br />7) \\"The Sherlockians\\" (3:03) - The feature explores the diehard, borderline obsessive Holmes fans who organize annual meetings to discuss Doyle's life and works.<br /><br />8) \\"Future Past\\" (3:08) - This feature highlights how, with the aid of both sets and modern technology, the filmmakers were able to recreate the glory and grime of Victorian London.<br /><br />The ninth feature is included in the \\"Behind the Movie\\" section and is called \\"Sherlock Holmes Reinvented\\" (14:06) - This is a more involving feature which functions as an extension of the other featurettes. The filmmakers discuss why they felt attracted to the project and how they desired to stay true to the source material, as opposed to the cinematic versions of the past.<br /><br />The most celebrated special feature here, prominently featured in the television ads, is the \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\". This is a sort of interactive film commentary with director Ritchie (running slightly longer than the film itself) that includes picture-in-picture still images, behind the scenes videos, cast and crew interviews, technical details of the film, and of course Ritchie's commentary. It's this sort of feature that truly makes a Blu-Ray special, aside from the enhanced high-definition image, of course. A typical film commentary simply has the director talking over the film, which can be informative but distracting. The \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" is a much more entertaining commentary that even includes the option for user interactivity.<br /><br />The content of the film itself is highly subjective, particularly with a character as famed and revered as Sherlock Holmes, and I don't feel particularly compelled to add my thoughts. As a Blu-Ray release, however, this title is every bit as impressive as it should be. I particularly appreciate how the special features didn't just shed light on the filmmaking process, but spent ample time discussing Doyle's stories, the various interpretations of the Holmes character, and the lasting legacy of it all.

B002RAREAK|4.0|On his sixth album in his seventeen-year career, Usher returns to the formula that made Confessions a huge success six years ago.  When the buzz single Papers released was clearly a ode to the personal drama Usher was going through, the only other track on the CD that showcases heartbreak is the Bryan Michael Cox produced gem Foolin Around. The lead single from the album Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home) is a nice track it didn't really require Piles on the track, as his rap is horrible. On the club friendly single Little Freak, Usher hooks up with the likes of Nicki Minaj and while it took this song a while to grow on me, it's sure to be a favorite for the young crowd.  Usher has always been in top form when it comes to the slow jams and on There Goes My Baby, Makin Love In The Night and my personal favorite Mars Vs. Venus, Usher doesn't disappoint.  My only compliant with the album is Usher cut two of the ballads I Love You 2 & Love Looks Good that leaked last year. All in all this is a fine album, which should help Usher get back into the spotlight after the much-underrated Here I Stand.  Favorite Songs  1. Mars Vs. Venus  2. There Goes My Baby  3. Pro Lover & Makin Love Into The Night (tie)    So So Tracks  1. Guilty  2. Monstar  Tracks That Never Should Have Made The Album  1. OMG

This was the first time seeing Rie Rasmussen. She did a great job in this part.  I've liked Jamel Debbouze's acting since I first saw him in Amelie.  They complement each other perfectly in this film.  The film is in black and white, and it really pulls the viewer into the story with  the back ground shots of Paris.

B0000041LA|3.0|On the face of the matter, this set should have a lot going for it. After all, here is one of Russia's most accomplished pianists performing the most notable post-romantic Russian concertos, and accompanied into the bargain by one of the world's greatest orchestras. To be sure, there is a lot to be said in favour of what we find on these two discs. The problem that I have with it comes mainly when I hear some of these concertos played by certain others, but that only highlights a lack of sheer `quality' throughout, a lack that I ought to have noticed in the first place.<br /><br />We should not, I feel, let ourselves be satisfied with the recorded sound here. Up to a point it is all right. Solo and orchestra are in good balance with each other, and the tone of all participants is moderately faithful and without distortion except for a slightly tinny effect from the piano in no 2. What is missing in general is vividness, the brightness of sound that is essential to so much of Prokofiev. If you just listen to Richter in no 5 you will, I'm sure, understand immediately what I mean. By comparison Ashkenazy lacks impact, and the main reason for this lies in the recording. It is as if the engineers have put a thin muslin veil between us and the performers - we can hear it all perfectly well but the final degree of clarity is what is missing, and this is music in which such a drawback is more important than in some other music. Nor is this problem restricted to the solo, as you can quickly verify if you compare even the first few bars of the moderato movement in no 5 from the Polish orchestra with Richter on the one hand and the great LSO here with Ashkenazy and under the distinguished baton of Previn.<br /><br />Then again try no 4, the left-hand only work written, like Ravel's great masterpiece, for Paul Wittgenstein who lost his right arm in WWI. Wittgenstein then professed not to understand it and declined to perform it, but if evolution had aeons ago set out to evolve a left hand perfect for the job then that left hand would surely have belonged to Rudolf Serkin. Serkin gave the work its American premiere, he plainly has no difficulty in understanding it, and neither have I, accustomed of course to having it played for me by Serkin. As with Richter in no 5, here again there is the extra sense of forwardness that I want so much. However when I hear Serkin and Ormandy in the andante and then play the Ashkenazy account for comparison I start to feel a certain misgiving about the solo playing. Serkin and Ormandy are in a rapt dialogue, whereas the effect here is a bit noncommittal, and that points up, I fear, something I have felt for many years about Ashkenazy's playing in general. I suspect that everything came too easily to him. I know what he can be like, because I still cherish his account of the Chopin studies that I bought for only pennies decades ago, and which I love for the wiry intensity of the playing. Ashkenazy's technique is to all intents infinite, and I never saw a performer less troubled by nerves in public. However something - hard to pinpoint but all too easy to sense - seems to have gone out of his playing later, in Beethoven, in Scriabin, in Chopin even and now here in Prokofiev. Put crudely, too much of his playing is just a bit ordinary.<br /><br />I don't have handy versions of nos 1-3 for comparisons, but I suspect that these are the best performances in this set with or without carrying out this kind of quality check. I am not suggesting that any performance here is bad or anything remotely near bad, it is just a matter of what Prokofiev ought to sound like, can sound like, and does sound like from such as Richter and Serkin. Obviously, you may not agree with my reservations, in which case you have got a bargain here. I am not even advising against buying the set, especially if you have no intention of stressing over some ultimate degree of quality. However once I had an idea of what this ultimate degree waslike I could no longer be satisfied with less. My advice is -- shop around.like I could no longer be satisfied with less. My advice is -- shop around.
0316069906|5.0|I took Eating Animals out of its packaging with the intention of reading the first page or so, then changing out of my work clothes, then starting dinner. Before I knew it I had read 50 pages. That's the beauty of this book; it's incredibly accessible -- exactly what this topic so desperately needs. Foer is a hell of a writer, which is partly what makes this book great. But equally significant is the fact that he's also just an average guy struggling to make his eating habits jibe with his morality. I think a lot of people can relate to that. As important as guys like Jeremy Bentham and Peter Singer are to this discussion, they're not the best choices for the average reader. Foer gets this. In fact, Bentham and Singer don't even get a mention in the book. Foer's writing is conversational, thoughtful and straightforward. It's intelligent and confident without being condescending.     This is the most contemporary and relevant book about vegetarianism and meat production I've come across. It tackles a heavy, complex issue, yet it's as easy to read as a beach book. It's a great start to a new way of looking at a critical issue. Man we need more like it.

B001C4AFOY|5.0|I saw this movie at a film festival last autumn in East Hampton  and of the three productions we saw this was far superior and a  lovely surprise. Anyone who has an interest in history knows this  should be a love story between two unlikely people who stablized an empire. Both young actors shine and their chemistry is just what was needed. The sets and costumes are first rate and it is a lush movie..many people at the filming commented they were disappointed when it ended..they wanted more! You don't hear that often these days. The other films were such a disappointment and this film made the journey worthwhile.I highly recommend this as a very personal look back into the love story that changed the British Empire.

1400052173|4.0|Others have stated their opinions on this book and the ratings demonstrate just how good this book really is.  I had difficulty putting the book down.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history and medicine.  Skloot has done her homework and it shows.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|I went to go see this movie in theaters back in December and I loved it. As soon as I was done I bought the books, read them and went back to watch it a second time. The characters are great, Jude Law makes a perfect Watson, and while RDJ takes a while to get used to he certainly plays and interesting version of Holmes. It is definitely something I would recommend watching.     However, while I loved the movie, the DVD is a huge disappointment :/ It feels like they put no time and effort into it at all. No special features (I was really hoping for deleted scenes and/or bloopers) except for one 'how its made' segment. The start menu is also really unimpressive. It seems that they put all the extra stuff (including a different cover) on the blu-ray and left the DVD with nothing.     Anyway, I wouldn't bother getting it, instead get a friend to buy the Blu Ray-DVD combo pack and steal their DVD version :P
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Some people should just not narrate documentaries. Oprah Winfrey is one of them. All I can say is that I can't wait for the BBC version to be available in America, and that I was completely let down when Life aired on the Discovery Channel. The cinematography is as spectacular as to be expected, but do yourself a favor and watch the BBC version.
0060935464|4.0|This is a classic, so I think that I expected more that was actually there.  I liked it but did not love it!
B000FC0P9E|1.0|i dont know why there are so many good reviews... after 150 pages this book is all about a girl rambling to herself in a swamp about baseball and her boring dysfunctional family.  i keep reading it the same way you watch a trainwreck.... i keep asking myself, can it really be this bad?  how can king make money writing this junk?
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|I had seen the movie before and liked it.  Was thrilled to find it on Amazon.com.  The movie is in great condition and was delivered well within the time frame stated.   Thank you for a great movie.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Season 5 continues the twists and turns of previous seasons. Not just a tv show but an intellectual adventure which have you wanting more. I love LOST!
B001ZRYQSO|2.0|A while back PBS featured the DVD concert on one of its groveling for dollars campaigns. It was late at night and obviously I wasn't thinking too clearly because I bought the whole MP3. I really wish I hadn't done that, but it's too late now. If I could get my money back on this I would. I keep wondering what the appeal was when I was watching segments of the DVD on PBS. Maybe like any other advertising it's all in the presentation. There's only two songs of the twenty-six that I would consider loading onto my iPod. I hadn't even heard of Leonard Cohen until PBS featured him on their groveling for dollars campaign. So if you really are a true fan of Leonard Cohen and have an appreciation for his poetry then this album is for you, if you're like me and have never heard of him until now and you're considering buying this album then I suggest you give it some more thought.

0345444051|3.0|I enjoyed the book very much until towards the end.  I have read Clarke's books before and he has such a vivid imagination it is hard for me to follow his descriptions.  I reread and reread the book but still am stumped by the ending.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|Sade's \\"Soldier of Love\\" will be enjoyed by everyone who likes Sade.  Even though it's been ten years since we've heard from her, her vocals seem to be as ageless as she.  Soldier of Love is soothing and pleasant -- but is quite similar to \\"Solid Rock,\\" and, I truly love that CD.  So, it's the uncanny similarity between the two that makes me rate the CD a 4 -- otherwise, I'd give it a 5.

I strongly recommend this show if you have never watched an episode...I love each family member...a great cast, hilarious story lines, and just one of the BEST COMEDY shows ever on tv! GO ABC!!!!  I can't wait for the episodes i've been hearing about where they go on vacation and they are on the no fly list!!!  WATCH WATCH WATCH!!! I can't wait for the dvd to come out so that I can rewatch all the episodes.
B002VECM6S|4.0|The Blind Side starring Sandra Bullock is the sweet, real-life story of NFL football player, Michael Oher. The Blind Side isn't a perfect movie but it's darn close. Bullock is absolutely flawless in this film and Country star Tim McGraw proves he's a better actor than singer. Quinton Aaron who plays Oher is perfectly cast as well. This film will tug at your heartstrings, very inspirational drama. Check it out!

B0036EH3XE|5.0|I quit watching \\"Lost\\" during season 3 because it got a little too bizarre, but about a month ago, I read in Entertainment magazine that Lost was rated one of the top ten tv shows on tv right now.  Since, \\"Damages\\", \\"Caprica\\", and \\"Modern Family\\" were also in the top ten and I love those shows-if you haven't ever seen any of those, defiantly check those out because they are FANTASTIC tv shows-I decided to give Lost another chance.  I started watching the show again at the very beginning of Season 4.  After watching the first few episodes in order to catch up with what I had missed...I was HOOKED!!!  I have watched both season 4 and season 5 in less than two weeks, and I'm almost completely caught up with Season 6-only two more episodes and I will be able to watch the new episode tonight on tv!!!  This is one of the best shows ever written..so many twists and turns...and I almost believe such an island could exist...I'm dying to know who Kate ends up with...Sawyer or Jack???  I want them both myself...LOL.  I strongly suggest you buy the previous seasons and watch this last season as well.  I'm sick to know this is the last one...and if you want a few other suggestions of some other good shows to watch...check out my list below...    1.  Damages...on Fx channel...many twists and turns...Glenn Close is FAB!!  2.  Caprica...another well written sci-fi show  3.  Modern Family...so funny!!!  4.  The Riches..only 2 seasons unfortunately, but a great show!  5.  V...I'm so excited it's back on the air!!!    Any suggestions for some other great shows would be fully appreciated!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Everyone - children and adults need to see this at least once.  The images that were captured by the cameras are absolutly breathtaking and beautiful.  I cant imagine the hours and hours of footage that must have been captured in order to get the images that we see.
B000P12LWY|4.0|As the season opens, Henry VIII is bored with his wife and frustrated with his lack of a male heir.  While satisfying his carnal desires elsewhere, he's also beset with political woes and the possibility of war.  Cardinal Wolsey enjoys a privileged position at court until he fails to produce a divorce so the King can marry Anne Boleyn.<br /><br />Henry's personal and political lives were full of romance, intrigue, and decadence and this series is so exciting and titillating that it's easy to forgive its weaknesses - accents are questionable as are the hair styles (Henry has a buzz cut) and no one ages though the season spans many years (all of the main characters are way too young).  Jonathan Rhys Meyers doesn't look or act like Henry VIII to me and sometimes I find his acting laughable, but still I can't stop watching.  Natalie Dormer makes a tantalizing Boleyn, the costumes are lovely, and the sets are opulent.<br /><br />Those looking for accurate history will be frustrated with the writers' frequent disregard for facts, but this soap opera-look at life among the royals is riveting.
B0037AGASG|5.0|This Cd is actually quite good. I did not expect to like him ever. I wasn't to fond of his single one time at first and I'm still not sure of it. I bought this on a whim figuring I would see if i liked it and if not I would pass it off to my niece. Well i am glad to say that she wont be getting my copy! This album is not \\"bubble gum\\" pop it is comparable to Jesse McCartney's last album Departure. This is a very modern uptempo pop/R&B album. I can listen to the album the full way through with no problems! It is a nice collection of fun \\"us against the world\\" songs. It takes me back without being passe or dated! I am not the target age range for his music I am not a screaming 14 year old female, I am an 18 year old male who never imagined he would be listening to Justin Bieber. This album was a great surprise! The album is catchy and if you can get over the pre-judgments you will find the album is extremely enjoyable! My favorite songs are Baby, Somebody to love, Up, and Runaway love. But the whole album is enjoyable it is my new guilty pleasure! I cannot wait to see how his career progresses and how his music style changes within the next few years! He is most likely not going anywhere and I'm glad he isn't!
B002BWP4A6|5.0|The title to the review echoes a book title by Swiss pyschoanalyst Alice Miller.  For those that found the film incomprehensible, a reading of her work, along with Arno Gruen's \\"The Betryal of the Self\\" and \\"The Insanity of Normalcy\\" may help to set the mood.  Having resolved that I would only be able to see this film on DVD, I was elated to see it on the marquee of the local art theater.  Viewing \\"The White Ribbon\\" on the big screen was well worth the admission and the ~2.5 hr run time.    In Haneke's interviews about this film, he makes it clear that this work was set in a time and region in which he felt very at ease with his writing and directing.  He makes it equally clear that the sentiment of the film is portable to any situation in which hierarchical oppression takes place.  It is this latter quality that gives the film its universality.    The film does a particulary good job of showing children exercising (testing) their autonomy and posing moral dilemmas to their parents and caretakers, in essence requesting of the adults a framework or path to follow.  What results are answers delivered as physical blows, psychological torture, and models of imprisonment.  [It's bad enought to have the pastor's domestic song bird in the cage;  let's go one step further and replace it with the wild one.] If one considers that children are actually fundamentally good and looking for avenues through which to express this yearning, then the obvious lies and hypocrisy and oppressive physical and psychological blows that they experience come as a confusing, and ultimately angering, surprise.  This inconsistency between their natural strivings and the influences of their mentors results in a diabolical self-hate, turned inward as in the case of the farmer's suicide and outward in the many secret violent acts meted out on the villagers. At precisely the point at which the pastor must surely admit that his own children are complicitous in the violence, he berates the schoolmasterfor even proposing such horror and threatens him with slander and imprisonment. The cycle is complete as the disciple of truth and honesty fulfills and embodies the hypocrisy of the town's authorities.    To me, you could simply change the modes of oppression, insult, and debasement, and its message would be as applicable anywhere today.
0393072231|5.0|First of all, you Kindle complainers need to unplug the Xbox, throw away your sweat pants, shut down your blogs, get a job and finally move out of your parents' basements.  You're a bunch of screen-mad looney-toons.    This is a GREAT book.  Regarding the other objections:  1.  I dont care if Lewis flip-flopped on derivatives--in this book, at this moment, he nailed it.  2.  I don't care that Zuckerman's book was first.  Lots of cities existed before Rome and you know what?  They sucked.  3.  I'm reading Zuckerman right now and he can barely string three coherent sentences together.  He needed a ghostwriter.    The Big Short is a page-turner and educational at the same time.  I particularly enjoyed the overarching theme which is that on Wall Street if you incentivize people to look the other way, they will never, ever NOT look the other way.  This is old territory but Lewis puts a very fresh coat of paint on it.     The history of Cornwall Capital and how a few guys with $100k turned it into millions was riveting!    Buy the book, enjoy the realness of the pages, throw your Kindle out the window.
1601251505|4.0|Well I must first say off the bat that this book was well done. I'm DEEPLY appreciative that the core rulebook in this instance is pretty much sufficient in it's final release. I'm not impressed with having to buy MULTIPLE books for a rule set and paizo for the most part takes care of this by combining the basic rules for players and DMs under one cover. If one wants to, one doesn't really need the Bestairy. There is enough here to make some difficult humanoid npcs to deal with. I do like the reworking of the character classes. The mage classes are still a bit heavy handed with quiet a few mass damage spells and almost no effort in spell castings and divination to figure out what happens next. That will require some gm work to keep things balanced. The book will require a bit of studying by the gm before using, particulary the combat section which can be tricky. The skills systems was nicely done. No more 1/2 points cause of class issues. Whole points and bonus points for 'class' skills. I like the way the rouge classes were made to be much more dangerous but again a tad over balanced. More h.p.s for the rouge/caster classes I agree with. The dm sections were pretty deep in their presentation, so this will be REALLY helpful for most beginners and the player sections were very involved and pretty deep and could be a tad overwhelming for beginners, so it will be take a bit to get acqauinted with the rules and maybe a couple of re-dos and adjustments for beginners. The fighters are redone in the way that they are no longer just 'tanks' for the party they have varied skills that could make them that much more dangerous in combat and even out side of the combat arena. I do like the fact that there are instances where the rules do talk about interacting with others fairly extensivly and the players are treated as personable indviduals as opposed to just numbers and attribute adjustments and certainly more then just mere monster bashers as I've seen in a few other rule sets. A good strength about the rules here is that there is some creativity for those that think outside the box. Discard the mage classes and you can have the same rule sets basically with a complete differant focus and perhpas even setting. And the authors do touch on making up things and giving ideas to not overdo it and streamling as opposed to cramping a style. Mult-classing is somewhat encouraged as it has been said there are no emptly levels and how to handle such an instance to keep things from going monte hall in that deptarment. Overall I was impressed and I found multiple ways to excute the rules in this book w/o any problems. Though I do say that the pcs are very difficult to kill in a way they are almost indestructable in many ways, but that may be fun for quiet a few folk. The issues of balance is often touched on in the rules here and I do like that. I do really like that there are three paths of gaining exp and leveling up. I would have liked though a focus on gaining exp instead of almost exlcusivley killing monsters though this to is addressed. I do like the way the rules express the various differance of sizes. OVerall a good system but it can get very complicated for beginners especially in the combat dept and there is a lot of technical jargon that is like \\"blue means Blue\\" kinda of writing even with a glossary can be confusing. Overall these rules are a good set though it will take some work getting it down right and making adjustments and one may need to look outside the book to figure out some of the jargon.s.

B0030IIZ56|5.0|Just like the Toy Story blu ray, this is a must own for any Toy Story fan. Better picture, sound, new features combined with the old features, new animations, and a new sneak peek at Toy Story 3! Not only does the TS1 blu ray come with a free ticket to TS3, so does this one!     On top of that it also comes with a DVD which has some of the features on it already. I know some people might think the DVD is a waste, but for me it's perfect. Since my computer can't play blu rays, the DVD is a nice backup so I can take some screen shots and use them as my wallpaper or post them online! So if you're a Toy Story fan, make sure to add this to your collection. You won't regret it!
B003DYGP04|5.0|Written by Aaron. Finnaly! I thought it would never come! What would never come? you ask, but isn't it obviousTHIS BOOK. It's taken rick a llllllooooonnnnngggg time to write this, but it was sooooo worth it. At first I thought it was going to be about the new demigods, like Nike, the goddess of victory ( How cool would that be?) Or maybe morpheus. He'd be a cool person to have a demigod. But anyways7 the book was reeeaaaly awesome, even though it was just 1 chapter. I wonder what the kane children are talking about in the first  part. Oops, don't want to spoil anything : ). Anyways, f anyone is reading this article, deffinitley buy the first chapter. It's awesome.

B00005JKTF|3.0|I was so entranced watching Cate, I barely noticed the very legitimate problems other reviewers expressed about the film CHARLOTTE GRAY. It's easy to see why her career keeps climbing, she must be every writer & director's dream actress. You cxan easily imagine her playing any of the great roles--from Medea to Hedda Gabler to...well, to all the movies she's recently been in. Her beauty is at once breathtaking and simultaneously simply elegant.<br /><br />Her astonishing presence commanded every scene--and she was in every scence--which was a good thing, because as other reviewers indicated, there were some major problems with the script.<br /><br />I'll just mention a few here so as not to be repetitive of what other reviewers have already noted.<br /><br />For starters, the characterizations--particularly that of Charlotte--barely touch the surface of genuine personhood. She immediately falls in love with a hunk of a British officer, and when he crashes over France a few days later, Charolotte immediately signs up to be a conduit for the French Resistance (WWII)& before you can say ZAP! without any real training other than a scene that has the lovely Cate slevtly dressed in battle fatiques & showing she knows how to fire a gun--she's being parachuted into occupied France. What nonsense!<br /><br />The script--but for our heroine--is equally thin once she arrives. The Resistance is apparrently run like an incompetent social club, nobody seems to know what they're doing--except for Cate's character--and they are easily eliminated by the Nazis just when the audience would expect to see more of them. At one point even Blanchett's charcter expresses frustration and actually admits, \\"I don't know what I'm doing here!\\"<br /><br />There is just enough grittiness to remind us that war is bad & the holocaust terrible; but even the Jewish boys Cate is helping to conceal from the Nazis seem to only be there so she can play a surrogate mother scene. If a film is going to invoke the holocaust, then it would really be advisable to have substance to it--that, or leave it out entirely. In fact, there are quite a few things that should have been put in or left out in CHAROLOTTE GRAY.<br /><br />I could go on, but won't.<br /><br />The movie & production values were good enough that I watched it twice. If truth be told, it was really just to watch Cate again. This was her showcase, her show--and for that, it was worth seeing.<br /><br />Yes, I'm a fan...or a writing desk...whatever.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000ZOXDFA Elizabeth - The Golden Age (Widescreen Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B001U0HBQ0 The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B000189LE2 Veronica Guerin]]advisable to have substance to it--that, or leave it out entirely.

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|First off, I would like to say Thank you to Amazon. I got the movie the day it was released and have enjoyed it since. The movie came brand new, untouched and was the perfect gift for my spouse who adores Studio Ghibli movies.       The movie itself has some good bonus features to keep you entertained and the movie is just amazing. It's a pretty touching story, has good animation and voice acting. I recommened this movie for anyone who loves Studio Ghibli movies.    You won't regret it!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Written by Aaron.I was just reading through the reviews and I noticed that some of the reviewers said that this series was A RIP OFF OF HARRY POTTER! Can you beleive the nerve? The cheek? The audacity? First of all, this series has nothing to do with magic, and secondly, percy is NOTHING like harry potter. Any ways, it was a good book, to bad that it had to end. But it had to follow the traditoin of &#34;all good things must die young&#34; Also, did you know that you can pre order his new series called The Kane Chronicles? It's about egyptian mythology7 wich I think is cool because egyptian mythology is always overlooked. Actually I think it's the first notable book about egyptian mythology. ( Besides children of the lamp, but I found that book extremely boring.)
020161622X|5.0|Simply put, this is a must read for any developer/programmer who wishes to improve their individual proficiency. The material covered will be familiar to many, but the real value is in the presentation, which pulls it all together in an applicable way. The book has a clean direct style pointing out the many issues and inefficiencies that can arise in our daily work, and also provides suggestions on how to address them. The book offers a series of short easy to remember tips, albeit 70 of them, and includes cross-references between relevant sections. Topics covered range from a general philosophy of development, to tools, and suggestions on team organization. The authors do not presume to suggest specific methodologies or tools but rather qualities one should look for when selecting the tools in their toolbox.  I cannot recommend this book enough; It will certainly be a permanent addition to my programming library.
0861444000|1.0|I was looking for a good book on hand mudras, and the title of this book has the word mudra in it.  However, the book only has 2 or 3 pages in it about hand mudras.  If you are looking for info on this subject, look elsewhere.  I have no problem whatsoever with what other people have said about the book here.  If your objective is to study yoga asanas and yogic lore, this is your book.  It seems very complete to me. But I gave it one star because I wish somebody else had done the same before me so I wouldn't have wasted my money on it.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|First off, I already own TS1 on vhs and dvd, so I know some people might be wondering \\"Well, why did you bother getting it on blu ray?\\". Well, not only does it have a better picture to it, it has better sound. Also, there is a few new bonus features and animations along side with the original features from the DVD! Not only that, but there is also a sneak peek at Toy Story 3!     Combine all that with possibly one of the best movies of all time and you got yourself a treat. If you own a blu ray then this won't hurt your collection at all. It's perfect for any Toy Story fan. I recommened it to everyone!

B002UZXJA6|5.0|The first 2 CW CD's were all about the mesmerizing harmonies and perfectly lilting voices.  This one departs from that tradition, being more about the showcasing of individual voices.

0307269981|5.0|I finished this book by Stieg Larsson several days ago and it was exciting to the end, unlike the first book in the series which was not so exciting in the last few chapters after the main mystery had been unraveled, but was still extremely interesting. There are a number of riddles in the second book that get solved as the end is approached. You are kept in suspense, especially about what will happen to the main character, Lisbeth Salander, right up to the last page. Her closing words made me laugh and then made me wonder what will come next. For that I'll have to wait for the third and final book in the series.<br /><br />One way to describe this book is as an interaction of extreme personalities with a society that is both baffled and corrupt. The extreme personalities are three. First, the girl, Lisbeth Salander is a complete genius who has been terribly mistreated but retains high moral principles in spite of her bizarre behavior. Second, there is an enormous hulk, called the blond giant, who deals out extreme punishment to those who are disapproved of by his master. Third, there is the master himself, a twisted but brilliant schemer who controls an underground of murderous thugs and is not seen until near the end of the book.<br /><br />The good guy is again Mikael Blomkvist who works tirelessly to solve the riddles and help Lisbeth even though for awhile he's not sure of her innocence. Perhaps the author in real life gave Mikael his own personality and that is why he had the unfortunate heart attack at the age of 50 from overwork.<br /><br />Then there is the rest of the society, the magazine where Mikael works whose beautiful publisher is having an ongoing affair with him, the security agency with its thoughtful director who Lisbeth has done jobs for, the police department, ever confused about how to interpret what's happening, with its good guys and bad guys, the subculture of the sex trade which has its tentacles into mainstream society. Yes, it's a complex mix of personalities and culture showing the nasty and hypocritical underbelly of that seemly well ordered Swedish society. But most of all it's an exciting detective story that keeps you in suspense through to the very last page!nd culture showing the nasty and hypocritical underbelly of that seemly well ordered Swedish society.

B002ZNJWI6|4.0|Short review: good book, very enjoyable read.    Ill start out saying Im an absolutely HUGE fan of Alastair's.  The fact that he has responded to many of my emails to him asking questions about his work both in general and specific (asking if I understood what he was implying, asking about a specfic character, or even his own view of the universe) has gone a long way in even furthering my admiration for him.  I have read almost every published book of his to date.  This book is both different and similar.  One thing I had difficulty with in the begining, but felt fit by the end, was the use of first person writing even from three characters perspective.  For those sitting down to read this book, just to help you get your bearings: The character being refered to as \\"I\\" switches between Purslane and Campion at the begining of almost every chapter (except those in which it switches to Abigail).  The story itself is good, intrigue and mystery as you would expect.  The fact that the characters have lived for over 6 million years is a bit startling after reading many of his works, but it works well and I liked the premise.  The ending is abrupt and a bit anti-climactic, which I think is the sole weak point of the book.  Once again Reynolds paints both interstellar travel and relativistic speeds in a particularly awe inspiring way (reminded me somewhat of  Galactic North at one point) that gives you just enough grasp and understanding to draw contrast to just how much you dont understand the enormity of it.  A high speed freeway chase that lasts 60 thousand years?  In the end the book is proudly added to my Reynolds collection, and I hope to perhaps see more entries into this universe in either the Line experiences, or stories of the 'turn over' civilizations in the future.
0307593525|5.0|I got this set for my sister after watching the new movie, Julie and Julia. She was very surprised and loves the books as much as I do. The seller delivered the books in a timely manner and in perfect condition. I was very pleased overall with my purchase.
B000HT2P9S|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I wish Gaiman wrote more like this. Or maybe I am biased because I have lived in several parts of the Midwest and knew many of the places that Shadow went to? But I doubt that's what I liked about this great novel.<br /><br />I \\"read\\" this as an audiobook which really brought the action to life. I ended the book with the feeling that I not only wanted a sequel, but that I wanted a series of books with the very original ideas from this book to never end.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I read a couple of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels and enjoyed them, so I decided to go back to his first one and read them in order.  \\"Killing Floor\\" was a fun read.  Child writes in shorter sentences than I do, but that's his style and it works for him.  The character of Jack Reacher, an ex-military drifter, is an interesting hero.  I like him.<br /><br />You could nit-pick the novel and say, \\"that would never happen\\" or \\"too coincidental\\" and so forth, but why?  I don't read action novels like this to educate myself on reality.  The same way I don't watch action movies for realism.  They are fun escapism.  I like that you have a good tough-guy hero in an action tale.  The story grabs you from the beginning and is interesting all the way through.<br /><br />One thing I really like about the Jack Reacher character is that yes, he's tough, and has no problem going physical or using weapons, but he is also smart and observant.  He thinks, and doesn't just use his fists and guns.  Child adds elements of suspense, romance, and action, and he blends them well.<br /><br />The story is fairly basic with good guys and bad guys.  But Child adds twists and turns and keeps it lively.  It is a good first book to the series, and I'm glad I went back and started from the beginning.  Now I'll proceed to book two.<br /><br />If you want some good escapism action, Lee Child's Jack Reacher series fits the bill.  If you want to start at the beginning, pick up a copy of \\"Killing Floor,\\" and read it for fun.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks.
1594489505|5.0|I really enjoyed The Kite Runner, but there were certain parts of it where I felt like the story deviated away from the established writing style and went a bit too far into the fantasy/action genre (if you've read the book, you know what I'm talking about). It was a good book, but at the same time it was vastly overrated.<br /><br />This book is very similar (in style and genre) to The Kite Runner. It's a different story, of course, with different characters, settings, plot, circumstances, etc. However, it's still very similar, so if you liked The Kite Runner, I can almost guarantee that you'll like this book as well. I loved this book. I would actually say that it is much better than The Kite Runner, and doesn't deserve to live in its predecessor's shadow as it is a much stronger novel. The writing is very strong throughout the whole book, and doesn't fall into the same melodramatic pitfalls that the other fell into. I don't give five stars to just any book I liked. I'm pretty picky. It's not the best book I've ever read, but it does deserve five stars.
B001FB4W0M|5.0|Love the fourth season! Can't wait when the first season comes to blu ray in June!
B002VECM6S|1.0|Watching this movie was both painful & confusing. OK there was enough white guilt portrayed in this movie to pay back reparations for slavery. Sandra Bullock plays a mouthy mom only too ready to get into everybody's face about what she thought they should be doing including her white girlfriends who she met at lunch. When one of them broaches the topic of bringing in a black teen from the ghetto and that it might not be safe or that this very large teen from the ghetto might be dangerous, Sandra verbally slaps her in the face for being a racist. Then of course there was the obligatory dig at President Bush at the Child Protective services. Seems rich, white, mouthy mom Sandra Bullock can mouth off to just about everybody except a black woman working CPS, DMV & NCAA. But she eventually redeems herself when she confronts a gang of black crackheads who are catcalling her, while she was in the projects where she drove herself in her 2010 BMW. I didn't know weather to laugh or cry at this point in the movie. The few scenes in the movie where football was being played were just awful. Of course the opposing team is portrayed as as bunch of white, racist, redneck, Nazi's. How much self-flagellation do whites have to do before they can cleanse themselves of American History?  If anybody deserved an Oscar it would have been the actor who played SJ the young white son. If you want to see a good movie based on real life go see \\"Radio\\" or \\"Invinceable\\"! Now these were great movies.<br /><br />Two recent Sandra Bullock movies far better than this one are:<br />The Proposal and All about Steve.
B0036CWK8O|4.0|To tell you the truth I was afraid to buy this album when I saw it in my local FYE cd store because I feared this album would be nothing but a total disaster like some of those idiot rumors said it would be but I thought wrong. First of all this is not a metal album, It's more of an experimental classical rock jazz orchestra type music (like chameleon) but that doesn't mean it can't be good, The band celebrates their 25th anniversery with this album, They have re made and remixed their classical helloween songs into jazz, soft rock, pop, and rhapsody style orchestra with great choir singing for the keepers trilogy and I must say I loved it alot, and it is only recommended for those hard core long time fans who have grown up listening to their music, Many fans may have given up on this band but some fans still appreciate new and different things from helloween like me. If your new to helloween then I wouldn't recommend that you start here, Pick up keepers 1 & 2 or better than raw and the dark ride and give those albums a spin but if your a long time fan then give this album a chance.<br /><br />Overall: Great album none of the songs were in anyway mediocre at all and it deserves credit! And I wish they would stop adding extra songs as bonuses such as the song why? And just add em like it truly belongs in the album because I don't have it and that really pisses me off.<br /><br />BTW! Check out the music video of their blues brothers style of Dr. stein on you tube for laughs!<br /><br />Stay metal! \m/ \m/
B002YIHO7I|4.0|I love Sade's voice! This new CD is different for me though. I love all her other song but I still have to get used to some of the new ones. But I really love four of them so far, so hopefully the rest will grow on me....

1439130833|1.0|This book was reccomended to a friend by her dr.  She could not afford it so I bought the set for her.  I was definitely disappointed in it as it had nothing to do with the Bible, God, and/or Faith of any kind.  I was truly disappointed in it and did not give it to my friend.  My friend then came in and said that she had gone to the library and rented the book but took it  back after reading the first chapter.  Definitely not something I would reccomend to anyone.
B002WY65VU|5.0|If you like dark comedies this movie is a must.  Truly enjoyed watching.  Woody is a scream in this movie.  Give it a watch when you need a laugh.
B002Y5FKUE|3.0|The only thing I want to review is the quality of the DVD production   which is unfortunately horrible. They packed the entire opera,   all the set changes and interviews that were part of the HD broadcast   and all the bonus features onto one disc. This dramatically reduces   the quality of the video to barely better than VHS quality.
0312370849|4.0|I don't think I've ever read a book that had me as disturbed as this one. I guess mainly because I'd never delved much into historical fiction before. Things based on true life tragedy always piques my interest and unravels my nerves a bit more than I would like. Sarah's key is based on the big V&eacute;lodrome d'Hiver round up in Paris back in 1942 where thousands of Jew's were killed. The 1st person account by Sarah left me hollow inside; so distressing... so SAD!! I couldn't stop thinking about this book... about her brother. Picturing everything so clearly in my head. I even googled images from that time and read up on it myself. This was a really good book! I felt however, that the despair of Julia was a bit drawn out in the end, but I guess the author wanted us to understand how much this REALLY affected her (Julia). It may be masochistic, but I have a feeling I would be reading more books of this genre.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|It has been some 10 odd years since Sade had a song out.  I've missed her voice.  I became aware of her new hit \\"Soldier of Love\\" and when I heard it, I had to have it.  She hasn't changed.  She's a hit maker.  Her's is a unique voice and style.  Like Michael Jackson, there is only one. I've followed her music down through the years.  Should she go back into solitude for another 10 years, she once again will leave us with her best until her return.  Thank you for having the good sense to have her music as one of your many available online purchases.
B0027BOL4G|1.0|I grew up on a livestock farm and spent my career in the food industry.  There are needed changes we can all agree to - eg. we need to eat fewer calories and eat more fruits and vegetables.  Let's work on those and other areas of agreement rather than trashing a whole industry.
0393061310|1.0|Diamond goes out of his way to not involve culture at all. This blatant omission forces him to only talk about facts that support his thesis. Of course, geography, resources, and population density  are going to play a role in how successful a people are. But so does how they are governed, what role religion and science play in their civilization, are they accepting of foreign technology, in other words their culture.<br /><br />This book is very politically correct. The fact is that some cultures/civilizations are superior to others. Some of that advantage comes from luck in the beginning, but a large part comes from the choices a civilization makes as it develops.
B002AF4Y9G|5.0|This movie is a riveting thrill-ride all the way! Full of lots of interesting cinematographic, projection, and illusion effects. It has over 3000 cuts, whereas most movies have about 1/10th of that, and it keeps you entertained throughout. It's chaotic, obscene, shockingly and senselessly violent, and it's really damn good because of it. The Director's Cut is the only way to go...you don't want to miss a beheaded head on a stick! Mickey and Mallory (Harrelson/Lewis) are great in this action-packed cult classic mondo extravaganza. It's Oliver Stone's testament to, well, himself in all his genius with all the tricks and treats and effects, but he's earned it, with a bunch of Oscar winning films already in his back pocket. This is a must-have for any cult, action, exploitation, or slasher/splatter film lover! 5/5 stars!
B002W24E0G|5.0|If you like the wilder side of Little Richard, you'll love this album. SHEENA'S BACK sounds like it could be the sequel to Little Richard's BOO HOO HOO HOO, one of his best, in my opinion. I love this album. It's wild and raw. Crazy and mean. And it rocks like there's no tomorrow. If you love untamed early rock'n'roll, this album is a must-have.
0805209999|3.0|The Trial was not an enjoyable read for me.  The dense and surreal prose was arduous and while I can appreciate the effect of the writing and how the style added to the feeling of the scenes I did find it a struggle at times.  Many of the scenes are dreamlike with bizarre and strange things happening.  I found the bizarreness and randomness made for a heavy-going reading experience.<br /><br />I'm sure I missed and didn't 'get' what others find so compelling about the book.  I imagine that each of the characters that K. meets is an allegory of some element of culture or bureaucracy.  I'm sure that if I had worked hard enough I could have found meaning to many of the strange events and characters.  There are many interpretations to the book and different readers can find different meanings in the text.  For me it was just too tedious to enjoy or want to think about.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that the book was never completely finished by Kafka - one of the chapters is incomplete and it's uncertain whether Kafka actually intended other chapters to be written.  He certainly never got to edit his work so it is rough round the edges as a consequence.
0307463745|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I like the short essay format in particular and appreciate the note that the authors trimmed it down by 50%.    Most of the content seems like common sense - but its common sense that's not always top of mind so good to be reminded. I can see myself dipping in to this book regularly    The Hiring chapter is the one that I feel was about me ;) So many great ideas there that I've learned the hard way hiring developers for the last 7 years in the Bay Area. How I wish I'd had this book 7 years ago.     bravo

B000OVLBF8|1.0|Ghost Rider has to be one of the worst comic book movies ever if not the worst. Here I thought those old Captain America and Hulk movies were bad from the 80s, but this was terrible. Even those movies never took themselves seriously, they were just trying to entertain. Ghost Rider on the other hand was.    Where to start, ah yes the story, no I never read the comic books but the story was terrible. Then there were the actors. First Peter Fonda as Mephistopheles, that was awful. Then there was Sam Elliot as the caretaker, I really like the actor and I felt bad for him being in this movie. Third is good old Nicolas Cage, the man who can't act. At least he wasn't chosen to play superman than he would have utterly destroyed that franchise. Finally the rest of the villains who were the worst of all the villains an any comic book movie. Not even the very hot Eva Mendes could save this piece of garbage.  Last thing about this movie were the special effects. What the director/producers spent all their money on the oh so great script and even better actors that it only had enough to make a fake looking swamp and ghost town for the climax of the movie. Now to anyone who hasn't seen this movie please don't support it. Wait until Spiderman 3 comes out or go rent a movie, here I'll make a list of all the comic book movies that are better than this.    Spiderman  Spiderman 2  X-Men  X-Men 2  X-Men 3  Punisher  Punisher from the 80s  Sin City  Hulk  Hulks from the 80s  Daredevil  Superman movies  Supergirl movie  Captain America movies from 80s  Fantastic Four  Batman movies
0345314522|5.0|Written in the character of the infamous Morgan Le Fey, (Morgaine), the late Ms. Bradley brilliantly weaves a retelling of the rise and fall of Camelot, as well as those who shaped it's very existance by way of the magic of Avalon itself, the mystical isle surrounded by the Mists that were draped around it, shielding  it from the world of man, (which is told in detail of how that came to be in one of the many prequels.<br />Narrated in the 3rd person tense of Morgan Le Fey, known as Morgaine in the book, she retells the story of her life as a young girl, daughter of Igraine, Duchess of Cornwall, and her father, the Christian Duke Gorlois. Igraine, herself a former priestess of Avalon, and one of the 3 sisters who were instrumental in the legend, has 'renounced' Avalon, yet secretly practices the ancient magic of The Old Religion, which includes the use of the Sight, the ability to see between the worlds, and thereby shape the future through the use of Sending, a form of magic now known in New Age circles as 'Astral Travel', in which her daughter Morgaine is gifted with as well as her Aunt, the Lady of the Lake, and High Priestess of Avalon, Vivienne, the eldest of the three sisters, whose sacred charge is to keep the Old Religion alive in the world of Man, and prevent the New Religion of Christianity from destroying Avalon, and all that it has existed for...

B002WY65VU|5.0|WARNING SPOILERS!!!    Zombieland is a adventure/comedy with heart and yes a few zombies.    The story, there really isn't a over arching story, but that takes nothing away from the movie. In fact I liked the simple story of the four characters trying to survive in their own ways. Some times you don't need this huge story to have a great movie, and that what Zombieland is. The story is simple a geek Columbus who's managed to survive by being the loner he's always been runs into Tallahassee who's in search for Twinkies and enjoys killing Zombies. These two reluctantly team up on their journeyand eventually run into Wichita and Little Rock. They decide to go a amusement park in California because they really have no where else to go. The story is really just about the four characters and how the bond on their journey as the few last humans left alive.    The acting in Zombieland simply great. Woody Harrelson is great, his best movie I've seen since Kingpin. Jesse Eisenberg who I've never heard of before perhaps steals the movie from Woody at certain points. Emma Stone is does a excellent job as Wichita doing anything to take care of her sister, and she's hot. Abigail Breslin did a good job as Little Rock using her cuteness to outsmart the many times. Again WARNING SPOILER!!! Though most people who've payed any attention to this movie should already know who I'm about to mention. Last but not least is Bill Murray as himself. The scene at his house is simply hilarious.    I'd also like to mention the music. I'm not sure who did it, but it was also great.    Overall a great film that I think everyone should see even if you're not a fan of Zombie movies, which really this isn't one.
0140437681|5.0|Back in the days when young men and women read adventure tales there was none better in the adolescent genre that the imimitable Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-94). Stevenson was a Scottish Presbyterian who was trained in law but forsook it for the sake of fiction. Among his classics are \\"The Black Arrow\\"; \\"Kidnapped\\" and his great novella<br />\\"Dr Jekyll and Mister Hyde.\\"  Stevenson was a sufferer of TB and died at the too young age of 44.<br />  Treasure Island was published in 1883. It began as a story Stevenson narrated to his wife's son Lloyd Osborne.<br />It tells the thrilling tale of buried treasure on Treasure Island. The island is fictional but Stevenson seems to have located it near the California coast. He lived in California for a time. Jim Hawkins is the teenage narrator. When the old seadog Billy Bones comes to the Admiral Benbow Inn he carries with him a map of Treasure Island. Bones had been a sailor on a sea expedition led by the pirate Captain Flnt; he had just received a black spot sign of death from the blind sailor Pew.<br />  Hawkins joins forces with Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey and later Captain Smollett aboard the Hispanolia in search of the buried treasure. On the ship there are 19 mutineers led by the one legged Long John Silver and his famous parrot Captain Flint. After a series of adventures and much violence the treasure of 700,000 pounds is discovered and Hawkins returns home a rich young lad.<br />  Stevenson is good in melodramatic action and in characterization influenced by his mentor Sir Walter Scott. Clearly drawn characters such as Silver, Ben Gunn, and the evil Israel Hands are colorfully drawn. The author is adept at word painting excelling in lush descriptive passages of the sea journey and Treasure Island. He has borrowed the parrot from Defoe's \\"Robinson Crusoe. Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island\\" featuring young Jim Hawkins is not a deep work but is purely and simply an adventure tale to be read and reread as long as the art of writing and the practice of reading are part of civilized life.actice of reading are part of civilized life.
1439153663|5.0|This is quite an amazing debut novel.  Grissom writes that the characters of Belle and Lavinia dictated the story to her, although she did comprehensive research to keep their voices coming to her.  The tragic story of slavery and it's consequences on the lives of the slaves and their owners is not white washed.<br /><br />I loved this story of a white indentured servant orphaned and raised by black slaves along with their children.  The characters were so real and believable that I want to know more of their story after the book ended.  Lavinia's life becomes confusing after she grows up and marries into a slave owners family.  She wants life to remain the same as when she was a child.  Her marriage is a sad mistake and the consequences are severe and far reaching. Slowly and surely Lavinia is forced to grow up and take over her own life.<br /><br />Grissom's characters are real and well developed.  Her descriptions of the house and plantation life bring the story to full fruition.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more books by Kathleen Grissom in the future.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|First of all, I can't belive that someone could NOT like it! I read the twilight trio and I thought this was WAY better. This is action packed the romance scenes arn't to long... Its overall fantastic. If you liked this you should search under fiction then subcatigories under ficton then childrens then animals and then foxes and wolves. You will find this book and an AMAZING book called The Sight. I am a wolf fan and this book was amazing. Everyone should read this book. I can not belive someone could say the plot was lacking because honestly whomever said that probably cant make a better plot themselves. This was a tottal five star and I think Stephanie Meyers needs to step aside. Shiver is the better version of twilight. I think Shiver should be made into a series because I think the ending was one of those endings that you should follow up with amother book. It was a good ending all Im saying is that Shiver rocks!
0446569895|3.0|First off, I'm a sucker for almost anything Ozzy, even though his career took a dive a while ago. So I bought Sharon's book and compared to it, Ozzy's book is almost exactly the same but the stories are in shuffled order.    It is funny and you will end up finding out some things new about him even as a hardcore fan, but it's a bit of a letdown to have read some of the same things a while ago in Sharon's book.    It's fun bathroom reading.
B0001I561E|1.0|Although sold as \\"Used - Very good\\" it is very scratched and freezes a lot. Certainly not in \\"very good\\" shape like other used DVD's we have bought from Amazon marketplace vendors. Bought two videos from this vendor, both bad.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This dvd was out of stock at various places that I checked, Borders, Barnes & Noble, Target.  And I got it within a week through Amazon.   So I was really pleased.

So overall, good recommendation from me.
B002RAREAK|4.0|With an album title inspired by the 1979 divorce movie \\"Kramer Vs Kramer\\", Usher alludes to his recent divorce on his 6th studio album \\"Raymond V. Raymond\\". The songs are more upbeat than those on his previous album, the under-rated \\"Here I stand\\" with songs like opening sparse leftfield Jam & Lewis-produced cut \\"Monstar\\", the Danja-produced \\"So many girls\\" (on which he declares that \\"the king is back\\"), and \\"Guilty\\" (with T.I.) aimed at the dancefloor.<br /><br />The experimental Europop/Dance-tinged synth-driven \\"OMG\\" features will.i.am and reminds one of the will.i.am-produced \\"3 words\\" by Cheryl Cole or recent Black Eyed Peas fare. Sublime, surging and halting in places, truly lovely. Warning, it contains some autotune. Also outstanding is the RedOne-produced catchy Club anthem \\"More\\", an iTunes bonus.<br /><br />The more skeletal pair of \\"Lil' freak\\" (featuring Nicki Minaj) and \\"She don't know\\" (featuring Ludacris and pseudo African horns) should please fans of \\"Yeah\\".<br /><br />For ballads, there is the lovely lilting \\"Hey daddy (Daddy's home)\\" (with booming bass and sounding like something by The-Dream), the heavily MJ influenced \\"There goes my baby\\" (with the album's best vocal performance), the smouldering \\"Mars vs. Venus\\" and the groovy \\"Pro lover\\" (both produced by Jam & Lewis).<br /><br />Similar to \\"You got it bad\\" and \\"Burn\\" are \\"Foolin' around\\" (with a lovely piano riff), and the forgettable \\"Papers\\" (with lyrics talking about the breakdown of his marriage, and telling us he's ready to \\"sign them papers\\").<br /><br />I don't know if this album will be able to reverse his recent sales dip but that aside, I feel this is a much stronger album than his multi-platinum \\"Confessions\\". He may not rule the charts like he once did, but this is by no means a shabby effort.
B00125WAXC|5.0|This is a movie that is not only enjoyable, but every parent should encourage their children/young adults to view. It is a wonderful depiction of American perseverance, in spite of inconceivable hurdles. It's a true story symoblic of a phoenix rising from the ashes. It motivates and gives all who watch it the confidence to move forward into their dreams and destiny. It has a wonderful ensemble of actors, leaders in their field; aptly coupled with relatively new actors who are not over shadowed by the more seasoned veterans. The novices leap forward to take their place among the giants (academy award winners) Its lessons will resonate with all who view it.
B0030IIYWA|4.0|Great Package, great movie but..<br />missing Pixar short 'Tin Toy.'  It was on the older Toy Story DVD.
B000X9MFCY|5.0|Outside the US, the rest of the world knows the first Harry Potter book and film as \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.\\" This is the blue ray version of that first film. Actually the only differences in the US and British (Though this disc is probably the Canadian edition since it is region 1) versions is virtually wherever the characters say \\"sorcerer's stone\\" in the US version, they say \\"philosopher's stone\\" in the British version. Frankly I prefer the British version. This is a one disc blue ray product. The resolution is superb throughout the movie. This disc has the movie and the following special features: Additional Scenes; Capturing the Stone: Casting and Bringing the Novel to Life; Around the World Multilanguage Lips; Ghosts of Hogwarts; Yearbook Character Clips; Lesons in Qudditch and What It Takes To Hatch a Dragon Egg; Theatrical Trailers.  I particularly enjoyed watching this high resolution blue ray disc looking for those items that will be in the Deathly Hallows: the put-outter; Griphook the Goblin; the vaults of Gringotts; the first time the various characters met; the interaction between Dudley and Harry; and, of course, Snap's interactions with Harry.  I highly recommend this blue ray edition of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
B0030IIZ56|3.0|Great movie, great package.  Unfortunately missing Pixar short 'Luxo Jr.'<br />Once again, Disney does what it can to make a special edition, leave some out that was already there, and make more money off of you.  You either have to buy the Pixar shorts DVD or hold onto the old Toy Story 2 DVD just so you have the short....which is a classic.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|The movie is great!  We've watched it 4 times already!  Of course, all my family are former military and/or Marines!  Brad Pitt is great in the movie... I think he should have gotten an Oscar for his performance.  As usual, the DVD arrived within 3-4 days of the order date.  \\"Amazon does it best!\\"
1439190275|5.0|Everyone here (mostly) is talking about how great this newest installment in the Atkins series is at helping them lose weight, battle diseases and feel better. But what makes me feel great is, the Atkins people seem to understand people - we don't like to change, at least I know I don't. I don't like low fat and Atkins doesn't try to make me change. I don't want to give up meat and again, Atkins doesn't try to make me change. This diet works with me (and apparently my body too since I bought The New Atkins for a New You three weeks ago and I've lost 12 pounds in just over two weeks). That's what makes it easy to follow, not being forced to change is easy. Forcing yourself to count calories or fat is hard. Being hungry is hard.     But with Atkins, you get to eat and eat plenty. Yes, I had to give up the \\"bad carbs\\" to help my body start burning fat, but you know, it really wasn't bad. I could eat loads of vegetables, which most other diets try to get you on anyway. But I could also have chicken and beef, both of which I love. I could have olives (and olive oil), avocados, butter, cream, a fair amount of cheese and so many great foods, I felt like I was telling the world I was eating my vegetables to lose weight and cheating with all my other favorites.     Now that I'm into the second phase of the diet, I'm getting to eat more carbs and more foods. I've reintroduced nuts in the form of my favorite, peanut butter, and more types of vegetables, and of course, I continue to eat as much food as I used to - just different foods - and I'm still dropping weight like crazy. That for me is the biggest thing. I want to eat until I'm full so I'm not thinking about dieting all the time. And I'm not out of energy either. Isn't that what it's all about? Again, Atkins isn't asking me to change - I ate until I was full before I started dieting and I'm doing the same thing now. See? No change. I don't want to change. And why should I change?     Thanks to the Atkins people. They'vegiven me an updated diet with more flexibility (for even less need to change) and one that's been thoroughly researched and tested so I know it's going to be healthy for me from now on.     Anyone who can do all that, while not trying to make me feel bad because of the foods I like and want to eat, has earned their five stars. I wish I could give more.    Thanks for reading this. I hope what I'm saying makes sense.
1932100660|5.0|I didn't ever before have a reason to be vegan, nor strict vegetarian, however, within the first few chapters, I became instantly committed to eliminating all animal-based foods from my diet.   I'm tired of theory-based diet plans, and for the first time ever, here are legitimate scientific reasons for changing the way we eat.  Dr. Campbell goes to great lengths, thoroughly and consistently examining what he and other scientists have discovered to be the real culprit to human diseases; animal-based foods.  Americans are deeply addicted to meat and dairy, and The China Study flies in the face of our food traditions and beliefs, however, the 35 years of consistent study results is so compelling, I embraced Dr. Campbell's message without any resistance.  This book is an absolute MUST-READ for anyone who cares about their health and the food they eat.
B000007489|5.0|...Suicidal Tendencies and you consider yourself ANY kind of hard/heavy music fan you might as well be suicidal-call Kevorkian instead of listening to whatever nonsense you think is cool. This record came out the same year(1983) as Metallica's Kill Em All and I'm shocked and just plain disgusted that this band/album (like Kill Em All also ST's debut) doesn't get similar acclaim/reverance. When it comes to SuicidalTendencies and all the different albums/styles they put out during the 80's/90's theres somethin for everybody.     This album is mostly heavy/hyper/catchy Punk with fast/wailing solos and alternating shouted/sung vocals. The lyrics are introspective/political but wit a nice dark sense of humor. Call it HardCore(Punk) if u want but ST was never about being typecast musically or as people.  All the songs are really catchy esp the \\"ballads\\" \\"I Saw Your Mommy\\", \\"I Want More\\" and the infamous/legendary \\"Institutionalized\\" (as heard on Repo Man,Iron Man,MTV). The sound here is a big mix of Ramones,Motorhead,Hendrix,Black Flag,Iron Maiden- and this don't even do justice just a loose comparison for those not in the know. Hailing from Venice Beach/EastLA area of Cali this group also crossed cultural/racial boundaries as well as musical. Thruout the following years/albums there is no style of rock(hell- music) these guys couldn't do. Check out all their records and songs and if u don't like one you'll probably like the next.

B00003CXC6|5.0|As the week of Akira Kurosawa's 100th birthday celebration has came and past, I decided that it was appropriate to watch a Kurosawa film and what best than a film he created 50 years ago, \\"Rashomon\\".  A film written and directed by Akira Kurosawa and based on two stories \\"Rashomon\\" and \\"In a Grove\\" by Ryunosuke Akutagawa and featuring cinematography by Kazuo Miyagawa.<br /><br />Many consider \\"Rashomon\\" to be the first film that American and Western audiences were exposed to a Kurosawa film and with the film winning an Italian Critics Award and the highly coveted Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival and an Academy Honorary Award, there was quite a bit of interest in the film.  Needless to say, the film was an influence to many filmmakers and even received a loosely-based remake in 1964 titled \\"The Outrage\\" starring Paul Newman.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Rashomon\\" is presented in black and white (1:33:1).  It is important to note that the film has received major restoration in Japan by Kadokawa and the version featured by Criterion Collection on DVD as released years before the restoration was completed.  But the version shown on the DVD is good for a 50-year-old film and has its share of dust and specks but at the time of this DVD's release, the Criterion Collection did feature the film with a new HD digital transfer and restored image.<br /><br />The transfer was created from a 35mmm fine-grain master positive on a high definition Spirit Datacine.  The MTI Digital Restoration was used to remove thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches.<br /><br />Some scenes look very good such as closeups where we can see the beads of sweat on the characters.  But also various cuts during the forest and in many ways, Kurosawa's admiration for silent film is used in \\"Rashomon\\" as there are minimal sets and  kept things simple.  Also, the film utilized really technological uses of contrasting shots courtesy of cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa.<br /><br />With the Criterion Collection dedicated in releasing Kurosawa's films on Blu-ray, fans can only hope that this new restored version of \\"Rashomon\\" will be considered for Blu-ray release sometime in the near future.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />Audio for \\"Rashomon\\" is presented in Dolby Digital Monaural.  Dialogue is primarily center channel driven but for a more immersive soundscape, I chose to watch \\"Rashomon\\" via my receiver set on stereo on all channels.  According to the Criterion Collection, the HD transfer of the film includes restored sound.<br /><br />According to the Criterion Collection, the MTI Digital Restoration System was used to remove thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches.  The soundtrack was mastered at 24-bit from the original audio magnetic tracks.  Audio restoration tools were used to remove clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.<br /><br />It is important to note that the main Japanese soundtrack is included but also the original English dubbed soundtrack.  Personally, I didn't watch much of the film with the English soundtrack as it was very reminiscent to watching old Kung Fu, Shaw Brothers films in the early '80s.  But for those who can't stand subtitles, at least they have the option to select an English dubbed soundtrack.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Rashomon - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #138' comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary by Donald Richie - Film historian Donald Richie provides the commentary of \\"Rashomon\\".  As a film critic well-versed in Japanese cinema, Richie goes into depth about the filmmaking of the film.<br />  * Video Introduction by Robert Altman - (6:39) Filmmaker Robert Altman (\\"Mash\\", \\"Shortcuts\\", \\"Gosford Park\\") talks about his love for the film and Kurosawa's symbolic use of light.<br />  * Excerpts from \\"The World of Kazuo Miyagawa\\" - (12:32) A Japanese documentary (with English subtitles) based on Akira Kurosawa's longtime cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa who talks about working with Akira Kurosawa and gives viewers insight to the director and the their professional relationship.  Most importantly, the techniques used to film \\"Rashomon\\".<br />  * Trailer - (3:27) The original theatrical trailer for \\"Rashomon\\".<br />  * 28-Page Booklet - Featuring the an essay on \\"Rashomon\\" by Stephen Prince (Author of \\"The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa\\"), \\"Akira Kurosawa on Rashomon\\" (from \\"Something Like an Autobiography) and excerpts from Ryunosuke Akutagawa's \\"Rashomon\\" and \\"In a Grove\\" novel (both translated in English).<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I first watched \\"Rashomon\\" while I was a young college student and was very surprised by how the film was much different from \\"The Seven Samurai\\", especially when it came to the number of characters featured, the emotion of the characters especially the crazy Tajomaru and also taken aback by the reaction of the samurai's wife Masako.<br /><br />Needless to say, the concept of seeing flashbacks and finding out that these flashbacks were either truth or fabrications, one can't deny of how this film captures your attention as you want to know who committed the crime.<br /><br />I was impressed how Kurosawa was able to film \\"Rashomon\\" despite receiving a low budget and keeping things to a minimalist set.  Just to see how the camerawork came about, how meticulous the editing was since Kurosawa likes to shoot a scene with several cameras and of course, the character performances which were quite important in the development of the film.  In fact, prior to the film, the actors and staff lived together temporarily and it was a system which Kurosawa felt worked in bringing harmony to the set.<br /><br />As mentioned, there has been restoration done on \\"Rashomon\\" with the source material being extremely in bad condition despite the 35mm print from 1962 being in very good physical condition.  So, each scene was digitally restored and cleaned up courtesy of the Academy Film Archive, the National Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo and Kadokawa Pictures, Inc.  The film has been shown throughout the world in 2009 and one can hope that with Kurosawa's films making it to Blu-ray, the Criterion Collection considers the new restored version of \\"Rashomon\\" for Blu-ray release.<br /><br />But for now, those who find \\"Rashomon\\" can be content with the Criterion Collection's DVD release for now.  A good number of special features, solid picture and audio quality as one can expect from a 50-year-old film on DVD and an informative booklet and a few bonus features included.  \\"Rashomon\\" is definitely a Kurosawa masterpiece worth watching and having in your collection.t to the director and the their professional relationship.

B002RSDW80|4.0|I wasn't anxious to see this film, but a girlfriend of mine wanted to see it so my husband and I reluctantly went along with her to see this movie at the theaters.  What a surprise.  We loved it.  Even my husband loved it.  It's one of those feel good films.  Amy Adams is really the star of this film and her performance is wonderful. It is a low key film that is easy to watch and enjoy.  A simple story and very entertaining.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|One of the biggest announcements in cinema in 2008 was the discovering of a 16mm reduction of the original cut of Fritz Lang's 1927 classic/sci-fi silent film \\"Metropolis\\".  The 2001 restoration gave us the best representation of this classic film which has been shown in so many cuts and variations since its release back in 1927.<br /><br />But the DVD release in 2002 featured the 124 minute cut of the film and was the best version out there for the film.  That was until July 2008 and the 16mm film found in Argentina was located which contained over 210 minutes.  Spearheaded by Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung, since Feb. 2010, the restored film is currently making its rounds around the world and being screened. For those not familiar with \\"Metropolis\\", the version that we have seen recently features missing footage but the footage is told by a black screen with text, to give us information of what has happened during parts of the film.<br /><br />Granted, the explanations were enough to watch this fantastic silent film but one could imagine how much footage one had missed.  And now knowing that we have seen 124 minutes and the 16-mm found is over 210 minutes.  That is a substantial amount of footage missing.  With that being said, if I am able to catch a screening of this fantastic film, I needed to watch the previous 2001 restoration once more.<br /><br />And after the film has made its run, KINO Video has announced that will be releasing a Blu-ray version of the film which I definitely look forward to.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Metropolis\\" is a film that is available in so many formats especially in public domain.  But this 2001 authorized restored version was the best looking version of the film in the last decade until the new restored footage was found.  But a lot of time has gone into cleaning up the film and restoring it.<br /><br />The film looks absolutely beautiful and one can't help but be in awe of the special effects and how futuristic \\"Metropolis\\" looked, how clear the picture quality this film looks considering it being a nearly 80+ year-old film.  From the special effects to the costume design especially during Freder's dream of the sacrificial deity to the dream of death and then seeing this metropolis with vehicles and planes circling around the city.  It's just an amazing sight of what was created during that time period before computers and CG.<br /><br />The film is featured in 1:33:1 black and white and is the best version.<br /><br />AUDIO, SUBTITLES & INTERTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Metropolis - Restored Authorized Edition\\" features music composed by Gottfried Huppertz presented in 5.1 Surround Sound.  The music works great with this film.  Intertitles are in English, while subtitles for the audio commentary and special features are in English, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Metropolis - Restored Authorized Edition\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by film historian Enno Patalas. Subtitles are in English, French and Spanish.  Enno Patalas is very knowledgeable about Fritz Lang's work and gives us detail on the film.<br />  * The Metropolis Case - (43:49) A 2002  documentary on the making of \\"Metropolis\\" by Enno Patalas.  Patalas goes into the making of the film, the architecture, special effects, and what took place after \\"Metropolis\\".<br />  * The Digital Restoration of \\"Metropolis\\" - (8:48) Martin Koerber goes into depth of the restoration of the film and side-by-side comparisons of the film and what was done in the restoration.  In German feat. English, Spanish and French subtitles.<br />  * Facts & Dates - Text based information on production of Metropolis.<br />  * Photo Galleries - Using your remote, viewers can cycle through images such as production stills, missing scenes, architectural sketches, posters and artwork.<br />  * Cast and Crew Biographies - Featuring 13 cast and crew biographies (text based) .<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />Included is an 8-page insert booklet on the restoration of Metropolis written by Martin Koerber (supervisor of the 75th Anniversary Restoration on behalf of the F.W. Murnau Foundation/Transit Films)<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis\\" is just incredible.  What is amazing is that this 83-year old film has literally caught the attention of cinema fans because throughout the decades, there is always something new to find with this film because of the new footage and restoration that has been done to the film.  With this 2001 restored version, one would imagine that this was the best there would be of this film but sure enough, a new and longer version has been found, restored and is currently being shown in theaters.<br /><br />But still despite the missing footage that many people have seen for many decades, these incomplete films still manage to be quite entertaining and literally put any viewer in awe of how stylish the film was, how ambitious Fritz Lang was when it came to the overall production design and most of all, the science fiction elements which may have not been appreciated when it was first released but \\"Metropolis\\" was way ahead of its time.<br /><br />The film is literally dreamy and dark and just something that is hard to believe was created in 1927.  Could you imagine the vast miniature and large sets that were built to create the look and feel of this huge city where the management live and then this underground worker's city that seems dark and dismal.  With over 25,000 extras and such elaborate setups way before CGI and green screen, one can only be in awe of German Expressionism and Lang and Harbou at their very best.<br /><br />And this film has had its share of dangers as children were in the middle of rising cold water, while actress Brigitte Helm during her robot lady scenes was put near hot flames.  We get the sense of dire straits and sure enough, Fritz Lang knew how to get the talent to react as if something terrible has happened.<br /><br />When this KINO Video release of \\"Metropolis - Restored Authorized Edition\\" was released, this DVD was the definitive version to own.  But yet, not Fritz Lang's complete version.  Even with the new footage circulating at the film festivals, because of degradation, we are still a bit away from having a 100% complete copy of \\"Metropolis\\" but we are getting close.  Especially with this highly anticipated Blu-ray release coming at the end of the year from KINO Video.<br /><br />But for now, with so many public domain copies of the film out there, the \\"Metropolis - Restored Authorized Edition\\" is the definitive version of the film to own for now.  Even though we are missing major chunks of the film, we learn from narratives of what happened during the scenes not present in the film (you can view a lot of these photos via stills included on this DVD).<br /><br />The restoration done on the film is absolutely amazing and picture quality looks great and I love the musical, symphonic score for the film.  And also you get a pretty detail and in-depth commentary and documentary by Enno Patalas.  If you haven't watched \\"Metropolis\\" before, I definitely recommend watching this film.  It's a precursor to today's sci-fi films and its a film that continues to surprise people by it's look, its story and the superb acting.<br /><br />\\"Metropolis - Restored Authorized Edition\\" is definitely recommended but for those who have a Blu-ray player, be patient as there will be a Blu-ray release of \\"Metropolis\\" to be released later this year.es (text based) .<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />Included is an 8-page insert booklet on the restoration of Metropolis written by Martin Koerber (supervisor of the 75th Anniversary Restoration on behalf of the F.W.

0312983867|5.0|This is my favorite out of the whole series.  I could not put it down.  MMMMMM Ranger - need I say more?
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Product is excellent for CPU cooling. Compared to other CPU coolers, cooling is better, price is much cheaper. However, CoolerMaster tech support leaves much to be desired. My product was missing critical mounting nut and fan screw. E-mailed CoolerMaster via their RMA process one month ago. Still waiting for, not just the critical parts, but acknowledgment that my e-mail was even received. I have given up on them & found other parts that seem to work.
067960085X|5.0|I love Truman Capote and this book is exactly why. No one can come close to the beauty of Capote's prose.
B002UNMWAG|4.0|I love the Boondock Saints.  I've seen the first one probably 100 times, own 2 DVD copies of it, 1 Blu Ray copy of it, and can pretty much recite every line of the movie given the opportunity.  I'm not saying that to say I have a bias but rather because Saints II manages to get a weird backlash from the first film's fans and I don't think it's warranted.<br /><br />Saints II is definitely not like the first one.  But it's also not so far off from the first one that it shouldn't be sharing its name.  It came 10 years after the first film debuted and I believe that it does a great job of finding the \\"sweet spot\\" between what needs to be in a sequel and what can make it its own story.  It also does something you don't see in many sequels, especially ones appearing a decade later: it welcomes back the main cast.<br /><br />It has also caught flack for being \\"racist\\", \\"anti-gay\\", and a whole host of misnomers.  This is the way the east coast is.  I don't think it even crossed anyone from the coast's mind.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great followup to the first one.  It has humor, action, and fun, referring back to the \\"magic formula\\" that made the first one a cult classic.
0439023483|4.0|SPOILER ALERT    Okay...so I totally loved this book and almost gave it 5 stars, but in the beginning it was hard for me to get into and some of the names are ridiculous (The baker's son is named Peeta - seriously, come on!).  AND it was kind of a cross between the novels Graceling/Fire and the movie Fifth Element...which leads me to a big beef I have with how similar it was to Graceling and Fire.  Don't get me wrong, these are completely different stories but the strong parallels between the books is interesting...hmmm.  For example:    HG: Main character is Katniss / Grace: Main character is Katsa  ---  HG: You see a definite love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale  Grace: Love triangle is between Katsa, Po, and Giddon (Weird)  ---  Both Katniss and Katsa (and Fire for that matter) are completely anti-marriage and anti-children. Hugh...what are we teaching our youth!  ---  Katniss has the incredible survival skills of Katsa and the archery skills of Fire  Katniss is also amazingly beautiful and considered the \\"girl on fire\\"   ---  Po loses his eyesight / Peeta loses a leg.  ---  Not to mention the political unrest, corrupt governments, and mass killings.    BUT honestly once I got going, I couldn't stop and I can't wait to read the next installment. All-in-all this futuristic, sci-fi, war game novel with a splash of romance is wonderful. Collins also has a gift of leaving you hanging at the end of each chapter and the book begs for you to keep going.   I can't wait for Catching Fire and Mocking Jay.
0393072231|5.0|This is a great book.  I finally understand what happened that made so much money vanish.  It amazes me that Lewis could explain all of this in a book that reads like a murder mystery while the rest of the media is telling us that it is too complicated to understand.  Lewis deserves a Pulitzer.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|This is a fantastic film. Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt have great chemisty in this not-your-average-chick-flick.
B000ZECQ08|1.0|I have been a huge fan of the HP series both the books and the films.  I never have been dissapointed by the films no matter how different they may have been from the books. I understand not everything can be placed in the films.  However that being said.. The Half Blood Prince film adaptation was the worst... The book was gripping and exciting filled with all the things we have come to expect from the HP universe.. The film strips all that down and takes away a lot of what needed to be seen... and even adds things that either don't happen until later in other books or things that never happened... The movie was a huge let down.. I only hope they can make up for it with the last two...
1892005034|5.0|I'm really enjoying reading this book.  So much so, in fact, that I've returned here to Amazon to order the \\"Companion Workbook\\".  This book is an easy read with readily understandable examples.  I have found the implementation of the concepts to be much more challenging, hence my desire to practice with the companion workbook.  Some of the examples given do seem silly or awkward, I think because communicating clearly & revealing our vulnerable emotions is something we are not accustomed to.  I highly recommend this book because I can already see the NVC strategies changing the way I interpret other people's statements to me and the way I respond to others.  Rosenberg's \\"Nonviolent Communication\\" is a true gift!
0307269981|3.0|i am thoroughly enjoying this second installment and while I'm only a 1/4 of the way through a few things have already jumped out at me that i found a bit irritating.<br />What's with Lisbeth's whole boob job? is this really necessary since so far it doesn't seem to add to the story except to create a vision of a pre-pubescent looking young woman with large breasts? every man's fantasy right? it seemed a bit incongruous with rest of her character and considering the nature of the storyline i just found this out of place and quite hypocritical.<br />Secondly-if Miriam Wu's father was from Boden wouldn't she have a Swedish last name? and while i am not a geneticist i do have a decent understanding of the Punnett Square and i am pretty sure its highly unlikely if not almost impossible for her to have blue eyes. its like he wanted her to have a Chinese last name so she is clearly exotic but blue eyes to make her unique and striking.  Give me a break.<br />All just a bit too trite.

B002VECM4A|5.0|Precious is my favorite film although I liked many of the films this year.      The subject matter in Precious is unattractive but director Lee Daniels doesn't show full atrocities many are implied in scenes usually followed by the imagination of Precious.  Which takes her to another place to better deal with the violent incident.  And this gives in site into who Precious is and provides hope throughout the film.       In one scene Precious is at home and dressed for school checks herself out in a mirror.  Her reflection is of a slim, white, blond teenager.  Precious touches up her hair the blond teenager in the mirror does the same then Precious leaves the room for school.  The scene reminded me of any of us feeling inadequate and wanting to be what society views as beautiful.       And Precious doesn't feel sorry for herself.  One scene she talks about crying and feeling stupid the day before then she adds something like \\"forget that, that's why God or whoever makes new days.\\"      Precious is more than strong she is courageous in this film.  And gradually throughout the film in spite of spiraling events in her life Precious gains self esteem, learning and encouragement from the love and caring of her teacher, a nurse and classmates.  Something she never got at home.  Which makes you wonder, how can you not love Precious....... Her resiliency and natural intelligence is hers and she handles every ugly incident life throws her way with dignity.      Unknown college psychology major, Gabourey Sidibe carries this whole film.  I was captivated by this actress and wanted to see where she would take me as she portrayed Precious.  All the actors in the film were outstanding.    Precious is not for you if you don't care for all of humanity.  And if you assume people that look similar are all alike.  Also some subjects in the film may turn some away due to its truthfulness like headlines in the daily newspaper, \\"Mother drowns children\\", \\"Father rapes child\\".  But when a child survives and even thrives through adversities like this it is Precious.
0061251305|4.0|What I liked:  Rich insights into human behaviour, group dynamics and individual motivation.  Very useful, structured and specific suggestions - in essence, management tips that can be applied.  More readable than the average business book - well written.  I would have liked:  Less of a \\"consultant hard sell\\" tone. I think there's an emerging pattern of consultant academics writing books that over-sell the observations within, and verge on style exceeding substance. There is good stuff in this book, and the tips appear sensible, but the constant \\"move up one level at a time\\" to \\"the fifth level that we don't even know yet\\" ...maybe it's just me, but I think this book would benefit by turning down the volume; not every set of consultants' observations needs to promise a transformed world - it's not going to happen. I think this is a common problem in current business literature.  Summary:  In my view, a very accessible and useful book that possibly over-estimates its own \\"system\\".  I'd recommend it to young managers as a very good introduction to organisational dynamics, and to entrepreneurs who need a little help understanding the motivations of their employees.  This book probably augments \\"Good To Great\\" quite nicely - if you liked that, you might like this; I'd read \\"Good To Great\\" first.
0446569895|5.0|Well... Wow, just wow. It must have been said so many times before, but just how can this man take so many drugs over the all decades of his life? Like most biographies, Ozzy's covers his early childhood and some of his early `work' experiences. Unlike many biographies (although not that uncommon amongst musicians') after his initial success in Black Sabbath, Ozzy's life drops into an endless rush of booze, illegal drugs, legal drugs and substances not supposed to be consumed by human mortals.<br /><br />There is a strong humour component to Ozzy's story, in particular I liked when he catapulted himself in the back of the head with raw meat, and his experiences at the presidential dinner in the early 2000's. Don't expect much of an attempt at epiphany as you might for other biographies; one thing that can be said of Ozzy is he is himself, a booze-addicted word-slurring dyslexic crazy fool who somehow managed to live long enough to produce a hilarious, kind-of heart warming story of his life so far.
B002RDCEX4|5.0|A friend described this CD as his idea of the perfect band producing the perfect CD just for him.  As he and I share a common taste in music, I checked it out.  I have to agree this CD is really awesome! I won't go so far as to say it is perfect but it is very, very close.  There are no Cons to this CD, only Pros and lots of those.    The percussion gets to show it's stuff on Drum Song.  The guitars are not boastful or egocentric, but either supportive or softly (almost quietly) overwhelming as in Soldier On.  Dougie's vocals are uncommon and great but it's the melodies that I like best.  The melodies are simple, direct, new and beautiful.    If like me, you enjoy Metric, Stars, Phoenix, The Sounds, Shiny Toy Guns, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, you are going to love this CD. The only way this CD could be any better is if there were two of them.  Enjoy.

B002VECM4A|5.0|The realism of the movie Precious is mind-blowing. As I sat in the theater watching this movie, it was the very first time I EVER got emotional watching something that was supposed to be fiction.    Mo'Nique definitely deserved the Oscar that she won with her compelling performance of an abusive mother (Mary). Words cannot accurately describe how sadistic and sinister of a mother she was. One of the most conniving, manipulative and vicious on-screen portrayals of an abusive mother I've ever seen on-screen. Not only did she become her character, but she also added an authenticity to Mary...    Gabourey Sibide also deserved all of the accolades that she received as a result of her portrayal of a sexually, mentally and physically abused child. It's unfathomable how this movie is her first film. She became her character (Clarisse Jones) like a veteran. I've never seen a new-comer command her part the way that she did...    Paula Patton played a very compelling role as a teacher at an alternative school who takes a special liking to Precious and shows Precious love (in spite of how Precious feels about herself). She also had an interesting lesbian relationship that actually meshed really well with the movie.    Mariah Carey was absolutely unrecognizable! As I was watching the movie, I kept thinking to myself how familiar she looked. It took me a few minutes before I realized that she was the social worker. Mariah actually re-invented herself...    Even Lenny Kravitz made an insignificant role as a male nurse stand out. It's hard not to notice Lenny, but he too had a very meaningful role in Precious...    Everyone who was a part of this film turned an Urban Fiction story into some unfortunate family's life story. Precious deserves at least 5 Stars... A definite must-see..    My only complaint with Precious was how it ended; it was very abrupt and sort of open-ended leaving me to wonder what happened with a few minor details that weren't addressed before the end of the movie. I'll let you be the judge though...    Also due to the graphic language and adult situations, Precious is definitely not kid-friendly to watch...
0783114893|5.0|After narrowly escaping the knife of a deranged hitchhiker, Jim must compete in a deadly game of cat and mouse in order to stop the maniac from killing more people on a lonesome stretch of highway. THE HITCHER is a perfectly crafted suspense film built on superior characters and mood as well as a kinetic score. Rutger Hauer is as charismatic as he is deathly terrifying as John Ryder. He is instills more fear and intensity in a single smile than in a scowl. The desolate desert backdrop makes for a hopeless setting where a homicidal madman could conceivably go on a murderous rampage and avoid capture. The carefully crafted plot and structure make for a brilliant cat and mouse chase that is fueled by revenge and sport. Just when the film feels like it is at its safest, when nothing could possibly go wrong, Ryder glides in like a shark and catches both the characters and the audience completely by surprise. Eric Red's keen scripting paired with Hauer's impeccable performance both serve to create one of the genre's most notorious and memorable human villains. THE HITCHER is a high-octane ride from start to finish, and is a must-see for all Horror fans!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B0012K1ILW|4.0|Having at this point only released three studio albums in a career that at this point had been a decade long Erykah Badu decided to focus her energies on a series of conceptual albums that would keep her consistantly making music for a good while to come. This is the first volume of the series. Ever mindful not only of her love and genuine respect for not only the music but the spirit of jazz-funk Erykah follows her muse here in every possible way she can. With the exception of the intro \\"Amerykahn Promise\\" and \\"The Cell\\" the music here generally shys away from uptempo funk and in doing so does prove a point. Not only is funk by it's nature a somewhat slower music but often enough it's been felt that such a slower burning variety of groove will bring more attention to the lyrics. Of course it should also be noted that the two uptempo songs here have the most driving messages of the albums overall concept. This was released in an era where there was a lot of uncertainty in the country and world at large and the very poor economics of the period were having intense effects on the music industry Erykah was a part of,however awkward that may have been for her. The general message in this music has to do with the facts as she saw them: that a whole society of people wanting to improve the conditions of their lives in the 60's and 70's had,for one reason or another found that the generation after them had neglected that promise and/or been neglected themselves and,more importantly that no one seemed to be paying attention. Here we find tales of people still trapped in the same ghetto syndromes of poverty and lack of knowledge that had stirred so much awareness in the past so it's only fitting that this album actually has more a 70's flavor than you'd believe. The album has this charred [[ASIN:B0013384JW There's a Riot Goin' On]]-era Sly feel to it,only difference being there are a lot of hip-hop effects added into the mix. \\"Honey\\",the bonus cut here is the only song I'd have to actually stands out more as an individual piece of music on what otherwise winds up being a very album oriented project. The album certainly packs more individual punches verbally,in terms of lyrics than it does musically but it does have a nice slow burning acid funk-jazz flow to it all anyway. Honestly......the album looks a lot more exciting than it sounds in the end due to the fact everything from the vocals,the arrangements and even the powerful lyrics seem to hint at some mild personal resignations on Badu's part. But lucky for us this is not by far the end of the chapter in this period of Erykah Badu's musical career.the only song I'd have to actually stands out more as an individual piece of music on what otherwise winds up being a very album oriented project.

B002VECM6S|5.0|What's not to like about this sweet inspiring film? OK, it has Hollywood written all over it.... and it isn't hard to see they altered of left out some stuff from the original true story to make a very widely accepted movie, but it also is one of the most heartwarming and inspiring little films I've seen in a while. Sandra Bullock gives a good performance (Oscar worthy?? I don't know about all of that!), but I found it to be a bit stagey. That's not to say I didn't really like her in this wonderfully entertaining film, but even though I felt her emotion, I couldn't get past that accent. This is probably due to that fact she usually plays the same character in most of her films.<br /><br />Instead of picking on this good natured film, I have to ask myself why do I watch movies? The reason is to be entertained and 'The Blind Side' surely does that in spades. It is a very uplifting tale that will hopefully inspire you and make you feel all warm inside. (awwww now ain't that cute?) ;-b

B00080ZG1A|3.0|The Aviator, 2005 film    The film begins with a young boy being washed by a young woman. \\"You are not safe.\\" Mr. Hughes is producing a film, they have some problems. He hires Noah Dietrich to run Hughes Tool Co, a cash cow because of its oil drilling machines. \\"Hell's Angels\\" is a silent film in 1927. [The CGI effects are obvious.] Hughes can't borrow cameras from the competition. He has plans for a faster airplane and cumulus clouds. Money flows like water from a broken pipe. Then it is refilmed for sound. It's the most expensive film of its day. [Was it a great success?] Did the noise from open cockpits cause deafness in time? Hughes plans for airplanes that fly above the turbulence, and buys TWA. [The film begins to drag here, scenes of a Hollywood night club and a night flight.]    Hughes builds an airplane for speed, and test flies it for a new record of 352 MPH. Hughes wonders if he can be losing him mind. Hughes flies a Lockheed [Hudson?] two-engine monoplane around the world in four days for a new record. [Actual newsreels are used.] The Hepburn family is shown at dinner. [Are they mocked?] \\"A high-strung chap?\\" Can a big flying boat be used for transport to avoid submarines? [Yes, but not the \\"Spruce Goose\\".] Can calipers be used to measure photographs of an actress? The new Lockheed Constellation can fly cross-country non-stop. Hughes orders eighteen for TWA. Why does he burn those clothes? Mental deterioration? \\"Zippers or buttons?\\" Coal tar soap again? They show the manipulations used by big corporations to keep monopolies through Congressional committees.    Will Senator Brewster of Maine become the chairman of a committee? [This is how its done.] Can a scandal be concocted for adverse publicity? \\"Show me all the blueprints.\\" In July 1946 the XF-11 test flight takes off. [Two contra-rotating propellers to neutralize torque.] The something goes terribly wrong! But Hughes survives the crash. More bad news follows. How many bugs in the house? The FBI invades his house looking for evidence. Can America afford a monopoly airline? Hughes meets Brewster to talk over business. \\"Who the hell are you?\\" Does the stress affect his mind? Or some physical complaint? Do stock prices reflect true value?    In August 1947 Hughes went before the Senate Committee. He spoke out against Senator Brewster. Hughes explains how business works. Hughes questions Senator Brewster about his actions. Hughes explains how millions were spent for airplanes that never were delivered. {Experimental development.] Brewster's bill will be defeated, there will be no monopoly for Pan Am. The `Hercules' takes off from Los Angeles harbor. Hughes will develop jet airplanes next. Does repeating a phrase over and over have a medical diagnosis? The scenes in the last hour provide redeeming social values to this film, although some of the scenes run on too long. There is a background to these events but it can't be shown in this overlong movie. That is why a book is better than a Hollywood biography. The movie does present a feeling for events of long ago. It tells how Congressmen act for special interests, one side or the other.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|KD Lang has a pure voice.  I have been a fan since first seeing her on Johnny Carson years ago.  This album is one of her best. Some of the songs are recognizable, while others are new to me, but still wonderfully haunting and beautiful at the same time. Each song stays with me long after I hear it.  She is a true talent.
0385751893|5.0|This coming of age book demonstrates that the challenges of adolescence transcend into every culture and situation.  Bruno is a self absorbed young boy who has to learn that his perception of the world and his family are not what he has been led to believe.  He is the child of a Nazi leader of a concentration camp who is so lonely that he unwittingly becomes jealous of the community of Jewish prisoners he can see in their camp.  He befriends a young boy \\"in striped pajamas\\" unaware that he is a starving prisoner facing death, believing until near the end that his loneliness is a worse situation.  This beautifully written book shows the innocence and ignorance of youth and how unimaginable the reality of the Holocaust was.  It is an appropriate introduction to the reality of the Holocaust for adolescents in Junior High and above.  I highly recommend it for boys for whom Anne Frank may not be of interest due to the female perspecitve. Because of the difficult subject matter (children being killed) and the emotional impact on adolescents, I recommend reading along with your child.  It would be an excellent selection for a monitored book club or to be taught in the classroom.  The quality of writing is excellent. Although the theme is complex , the horror of the holocaust is revealed slowly as Bruno comes to realize what he is witnessing.  The writing is simple enough that youunger children could read it, but probably shouldn't.  I recommend following it up with Number the Stars, which ends on a much more positive note and shows the good side of humanity, as Jews are saved.

B000FC1LOC|5.0|Would you be willing to donate a kidney to keep someone you love alive?  If so, wouldn't you like to be asked and have a choice in the matter?  That is what Anna thinks.  She has two healthy kidneys and her older sister desperately needs one.  She is sick and tired of always being used for her sister's needs and the pain it causees.  Now she wants to have a say about how her body will be used.  Appalled, her mother can't even have a discussion with her.  Anna ends up suing her family to prevent the transplant.  It is a cry for help that finally gets her father to sit up and listen.  The suit pulls the family apart, and Anna doubts herself.  This is a typical Jodi Picoult book, emotional and dramatic, that has the reader thinking about the morality of live donations, using children as donors and \\"how much is too much?\\" in trying to keep someone alive.  You will not be disappointed as you read this beautiful story with a surprise ending, but be prepared for a good cry or two along the way.
0756405890|5.0|An extraordinary book,    Rothfuss does a first class job, he is an outstanding storyteller, builds real characters with unbelievably real dialogs, creates an interesting world and pays uncommon attention to language.    It describes an epic journey of an unlikely Hero and often-human fascination towards learning. Since it took more than 10 years to write, in some cases you can tell small variations in style between paragraphs.    Overall, one of the best books I ever read and the first time ever that I finish a book...and started reading it again.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|I am not a big fan of country music and listened to very little through the years, although I do keep an open mind and have dabbled in and own all types of music.  I had never listened to k.d. lang until I sampled her CD \\"Drag\\" when it was first released.  I was immediately blown away by her voice, and have been hooked on her ever since.  She has such a distinctive, transcendent style and manages to make every song her own somehow, even when doing covers that I love by the originals.  She is truly a classic, with a voice that will be remembered and revered for many years to come.  This CD represents a good cross-section of her many styles and shows how no matter what style she chooses to sing, she owns it, makes it her own.  She sings with such a deep sense of feeling, as though she is sharing an intimate glimpse into her soul, softly caressing your own soul until you lose yourself completely and willingly into the comfortable silkiness of her sound, a sound that will continue to haunt your memory long after the CD has ended.

Her reasonings for Islamic reform are not the rantings of someone who has been damaged by her experiences and is lashing out.

B0034C9CFK|5.0|Prime Cuts:  Every Now and Then, Taillights Blue, It's Just That Way<br /><br />Despite Alan Jackson's denial that there was any enigmatic motive in entitling his 14th album \\"Freight Train\\" but it is still an appropriate album title.  Just as a freight train is not about speed but about going the long haul, these 12 tracks are not about chasing the latest trends, they are quality songs that are going to be etched into the memories of fans for years and years to come.  Just as freight trains hearken back to the days of old-fashioned gait, these paeans belong to the best of traditional honky-tonk country sung in Jackson's most affectionate southern-drawl tenor.  If you like steel guitars, soft strumming of the guitar and everything rustic--this is a feast for the ears.  Jackson once again delivers 7 solidly self-written cuts, one a co-write with Roger Murrah, and 4 well-chosen covers, one of which coming from Adam Wright (Jackson's own nephew).<br /><br />If there was ever any doubt if Alan Jackson is the best thing that has had ever happened to country music, just take a listen to \\"Every Now and Then.\\"  In the tradition of Jackson's heart-tugging signature ballads such as \\"If I Could Back Up\\" and \\"Gone Crazy,\\" \\"Every Now and Then\\" brings out all the bittersweet memories of a love that has ended with so much realism that you swear Jackson has had read your own diary.  Another absolute charm is the Adam Wright co-write \\"Taillights Blue,\\" a devastating piece of heartache, which calls to mind Clint Black's \\"Nothing But the Taillights\\" but done at a slower pace with an even more gorgeous melody.  Romance in its more blissful moments do get a mention on \\"It's Just That Way.\\"  Written by producer Keith Stegall, Kylie Sackley and Vicky McGehee, this slow descriptive ballad takes its time to spell out long lasting love with rich blend of pastoral metaphors:  \\"That ole sun comes up every mornin'/And goes back down at the end of every day/It's just that way/Stars show up every evenin'/Man in the moon comes out to play/It's just that way.\\"<br /><br />Even when Alan Jackson lets go of the brakes for some rip and roar moments he again proves that he has not lost an iota of his energy.  \\"After 17\\"which tells the story of a girl starting life on her own finds Jackson telling this tale with youthful zest.  More moments of levity abound with \\"That's Where I Belong\\" -an Alan Jackson staple that pays tribute to his roots in the lines of previous hits such as \\"Where I Come From\\" and \\"Small Town Southern Man.\\" The brisk rollicking strut of \\"Hard Hat and a Hammer\\" continues the blue-collared theme giving some grits to the album. Roger Murrah who co-penned Jackson's magnum opus \\"Don't Rock the Jukebox\\" reunites with Jackson again on the extremely catchy hit-bound \\"True Love is a Golden Ring.\\"<br /><br />Noteworthy of mention is Jackson throw back to the past:  this time it is Jackson's cover of the Vern Gosdin's duet with Janie Fricke \\"Till the End.\\"  Lee Ann Womack with her traditional bend is the perfect choice as Jackson's duet-partner on this country chestnut; though their performance religiously stays too close to the original.  In a time when artists evolve with the latest trends and whistles, it's good that Jackson stays committed to one single goal: to continue to make great music that is country to the core. With such a lofty goal as its destination \\"Freight Train\\" is certainly heading in the right direction.he moon comes out to play/It's just that way.\\"         Even when Alan Jackson lets go of the brakes for some rip and roar moments he again proves that he has not lost an iota of his energy.  \\"After 17\\"which tells the story of a girl starting life on her own finds Jackson telling this tale with youthful zest.

B000I2JDEY|5.0|This film is monumental. There is no other way to describe the power of the screenplay based on the Edward Albee play and the exceptional acting other than to use superlatives. Elizabeth Taylor provides us the most outstanding acting on film by an actress. Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis are all in top form. Taylor and Burton did a series of films together but none compare to this masterpiece. This is not a film for everyone. It is a work of art and therefore open to interpretation and layered with meaning upon meaning. Some folks don't like complexity, strong irrational emotion, and a script where every word and line had meaning and double meaning. For them, this film is probably a nightmare.     Mike Nichol's direction must have been exceptional to produce such a crisp trip into the ambiguity of human relations, as exemplified in the lives of college professor George, played by Richard Burton, and his wife Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor. The use of black and white film, as in the outstanding film The Miracle Worker, heightens emotions and drama.     Elizabeth Taylor is a fine actress but in this film she is in top form. The character of Martha is a boiling kettle of unsatisfied desire, ambition, and intimacy. She is full of anger and hysteria, and yet vicious and cunning as any jungle cat. Alcohol only fuels her outbursts of self-loathing despair and fury. The target of much of her fury is her husband George. He is the one with whom she feels safe enough to viciously attack and still expect him to be there in the morning. He is the one who has committed the crime of loving her when deep down she knows she is not worthy of love. He is the one who knows her true vulnerabilities and thus he is always a threat if he selects to use truth as his weapon. All humans weave stories to make reality bearable, to make their existence make sense, to give some tiny piece of meaning to the absurdity. Relationships often require that we support each other's selfcreated narratives. When anger, resentment, erupts in a relationship, what more caustic weapon can there be than to attack and pull down the defenses and protective narrative that our partner has built around them to survive.  Rarely have we seen two people peel away each other's illusions and self constructing stories with such verbal surgical precision as is seen in this outstanding drama. Richard Burton is the other half of this painful equation, a man with dark unresolved secrets who marries a woman who will be his constant warden and torturer. He is a man with sin who is daily bombarded with his sin by his psychological jailer wife. George Segal and Sandy Dennis are perfect as a young couple on the verge of a life of resentment and pain not unlike that of George and Martha.     Edward Albee's skill with the English language is in top form in this play. George and Martha play vicious emotional games, changing the rules just as soon as the other catches on and starts to develop a protective strategy.  Ever word becomes a bomb.  Ernest Lehman's adapted screenplay is sharp as a knife.      As other critics have noted, this film is important in that it merges the psychological dramatic tradition of Eugene O'Neil, Arthur Miller, and Tennessee Williams with the absurdist, existential works of Samuel Becket and Eugene Ionesco. Sometimes the words used a weapons sound like lines from Waiting for Godot and then with raw emotion they sound like Long Day's Journey into Night.     For psychologically aware and experienced adults, this film is the genuine article.

B000EYK2GE|5.0|Carl Perkins is indeed the \\"Granddaddy of Rock 'n Roll\\". He was the first to come up with those hard rockin' guitar licks and set a standard in music that so many have followed. It was Carl that first wrote and sang \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\"-not Elvis.  Rockabilly music was born in Memphis, TN where the Mississippi Delta Blues met up with the Nashville Country sound to create what's commonly refered to as \\"Rock and Roll.\\"   If you enjoy that long gone, lonesome Rockabilly sound that Carl created and other's have imitated, then you need to add this CD to your collection.  It's only natural that some of his \\"students\\" like Harris, Starr, Edmunds, Clapton & others got together to pay the real King of Rock 'n Roll homage.
B00007K02F|5.0|Jane Eyre was rejected and abused by her aunt, and she became a governess for Mr. Rochester's daughter. She fell in love with Mr. Rochester and after many ordeals and separations, they were married. Genuine love and faithfulness created the romance of the movie. I enjoyed it being myself a teacher.

B001QWBM62|5.0|This is my 4th recorder.  I started out with a Foxtex, a long time ago, had a lot of trouble with it.  Got a Tascam full size 8 channel recorder and loved it.  Then I decided to try these portable units.  Started with the H4, very nice, simple unit, then upgraded to the H4n when it came out.  This unit is as nice as my full size Tascam.  Does everything and isn't very difficult to use.  I had also tried the Boss but the menu's were very confusing, hard to use.  I love this thing, you can create anything you could with a full recording unit.
B0035G5IOE|4.0|It took two views but I loved this movie:    A fan of both stop-motion animation and Wes Anderson, this film was a field day for me;  Anderson created a whimsical world of charming woodland animals who talk and act with the same shining irreverence and neurosis as characters from his previous movies. The characters, even as animals, all seem to have that same honest sense of lovable melancholy that always remains undeniably optimistic.      As is often the case with Anderson's films, Mr. Fox is designed beautifully with that consistent sense of colorful minimalism that spawns a magical visual aesthetic: a style that flourishes when animated.  For me, between this and Where the Wild Things are, I feel like many filmmakers are taking children's conceptions and really making films for adults. Mr. Fox was so enjoyable and also so consistently smart. The humor was unlike that in a Shrek movie with obvious jokes for children and then plenty for adults; the humor in Mr. Fox was skewed more towards edgy and ironic (without being vulgar at all).      All elements combined; this movie was artfully spectacular, and just so darn charming.     Bring the wife, kids, and your hipster cousins along because 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' has something for everyone.
0739377582|2.0|I loved Mankell's earlier books, but -- other than the terrific opening scene -- he missed the mark with this one. He unsuccessfully tried to weave too many complicated stories together without making the reader care about any of it.  The main characters were not compelling, the story was unbelievable, and the motive for the murders was telegraphed within the first pages set in the 1800's.  There was no mystery here.  Perhaps if Mr. Mankell gave each of the subplots a book of its own, it would have resulted in several must-read novels.  This, unfortunately, is not one of them.  Including a condensed version of a 5 hour political speech was especially out of place in this book.

0307454541|3.0|Based on the many positive customer reviews, and based on the fact that this is so highly ranked on the Kindle best sellers list, I must say that I was disappointed with this book.  In fairness, I had very high expectations.<br /><br />When reading any major mystery or crime thriller, one of the key tests for me is, \\"Can this really happen?\\"  Even when a book is fiction, much of the joy in reading is \\"believing\\" in the story.  Larsson sells out with believability in several parts of the story.  It makes no sense to me that someone who gets shot at several times wouldn't call the police, or go to the police for help immediately.  The lame excuse of wanting to avoid unnecessary PR is given here.  In another instance, a serial murderer who has literally been getting away with murder for decades is foiled because he neglects to shut a door-come on!  Someone who's been able to get away with murder for that long would never be so careless!<br /><br />Also, does the main character really need to sleep with every female character that he comes in contact with?  I think the story would have been just as interesting without the need to include this.<br /><br />My complaints aside, I would probably still recommend reading the book.  It's an interesting story and except for the specific hang-ups that I have, it is well written.  Based on my disappointments with this book, I'll probably pass on his next book, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire,\\" however.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Very good read. Should be required reading in our schools. More Band of Brothers, less sex ed!
B002ZG98GO|5.0|I also agree with the comments above.  It is a fantastic film, fun and serious at the same time.  It also holds an important message that is so easily forgotten in the turbulent world of today:  \\"There are only two kinds of people in this world - People who do good and people who do bad.\\"
B000QUCNP4|5.0|Based on a true story, Zodiac is a psychological thriller gem.  The director is Fincher and he creates a thick web of character-driven plot lines.<br /><br />The beginning scene shows the first murders and the victim's pain and fear.  Each scene holds your attention as the movie examines one man's obsession with finding the truth and one man's need to kill.<br /><br />In 1968, the San Francisco Chronile receives a letter with the Zodiac's ciphers.  A cartoonist by the name of Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), loves puzzles and as a former Boy Scout, he tries to decode the messages.  Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a reporter that wants to advance in his career and looks at this as an opportunity to do so.  As this is going on, several investigators from four jurisdictions ardently look for the elusive Killer.  Dave Toschi (Mark Fuffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) clash with news reporters, including Avery and Graysmith.  Graysmith keeps an interest in this case, and also writes a book about it.  The movie follows the investigation from 1968 - 1984 - a long, suspenseful search by Graysmith even after others have retired, given up, or just want to spend more time with their families.  The thriller is focused on dialogue, tenuous clues, and riveting cat and mouse maneuvers.<br /><br />Zodiac is a satisfying top-notch true life thriller
1932100660|5.0|After studying the research presented in this book, I have decided that the best way to solve the health care crisis in American is not to dump more money into the medical and/or insurance programs but it is to have each person in America to start eating a whole grain plant based diet.
B00005JMJG|4.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind takes a leap of faith that medical science can now erase specific sad or hurtful memories.  The main characters in this movie are a quirky couple, Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet).  They have a wonderful relationship, yet time and familiarity slowly tears them apart through hurt and anger. A painful fight and cutting words cause Clementine to have a medical procedure so she can erase Joel from her mind.  Joel is hurt too.  The scenes flip from time to time and at one point we see Joel approaching Clementine in a book store where she works, and realizes she does not recognize him.  He  breaks doen in front of his friends.  As he becomes desperate with heartache and pain his friend sympathizes, and gives Joel a confidential card with the doctor's name that erased Clementine's memory of him.<br /><br />Joel then goes to Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) to get the same treatment as Clementine.  As his memories begin to fade, he realizes how much he still loves her.  He fights back in his mind as the medical technicians (Kirsten Dunst and<br /><br />Most of the movie is going inside Joel's mind during the medical procedure as memories of Clementine are erased.  The fantastic camera work showing memories coming and going, disjointed flashbacks and  eerie comedic tone is stunning to watch.  The cinematography and special effects throughout are utterly amazing, entertaining and truly communicate the happiness, hurt and strange unbreakable connections of true love.<br /><br />Carrey plays his part well, not his usual over-the-top characterizations, Winslet is wonderful as the free-spirited sprite and love interest.  There are excellent performances by Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo.  The actors give a topnotch performance, full of hip catchy youthful dialogue.<br /><br />This movie is fun and different.  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a brilliant, thoughtful look at true love.  The acceptance of each others shortcomings, and forgetting and forgiving.omings, and forgetting and forgiving.

B00338QENI|5.0|I'm not in the science or medical field and had no knowledge about Henrietta Lacks of Hela, I simply stumbled upon this book while browsing at Amazon and thought it sounded fascinating.  From the first chapter, this book wove together a fascinating personal and family story and also brought topics that have gained increasingly greater attention and focus over the last 10-15 years into focus, specifically ethics, privacy and medical advancement based on genetic information.  Rebecca Skoot does an amazing balancing act with her reporting and writing here.  She doesn't get too close to her subject matter to become a puppet or sycophant for them, but she also uses their experiences to help the reader better understand the medical, ethical and moral dimensions that Henrietta Lack's story has for all with the advancement of modern medicine.<br /><br />Given all of the spate of research and investigative reporting that has led to the disclosure of government sponsored research that took place without consent and information of those research subjects, especially minorities, the background of this book was not a revelation and surprise.  However, it was fascinating to better understand the importance and impact that was enabled by the culturing of Hela cells (as well as the pervasive contamination that resulted from poor practices).  The characters in this book paint bring would conjure up a Greek tragedy if there were any ever seemingly positive side to the Lacks's family history.  However, it is a seemingly endless struggle for the generation of Lacks's that follow Henrietta that breeds an ever greater degree of contempt and bitterness than exists in most epic tragedies.<br /><br />While this book brings to life the story of a relatively unknown and unwitting person who has had an undue and unintended amount of influence the world over, it is the questions that the topic raises that permeate the very real and contentious issues in the health care debate we face today -- what privacy do we have over our genetic markers and tissues?  How can others, especially companies use this information to discriminate against us?  Will the ability to understand, treat and cure diseases be stopped by too much individual greed and bureaucracy?  These are complex questions without easy or binary answers and \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" provides a wonderful human entry into a difficult and fascinating set of issues that we are and will continue to grapple with for many years to come.we have over our genetic markers and tissues?

B00006AW2G|5.0|The Stones have seldom personified unity. They're the informants to modern-day reality - whether it's grim or pleasurable. And it's this fact that gives this recording its thematic nucleus.<br /><br />Keith's melodic construction, his rhythm-in-the-lead guitar and the buildup of the instrumentation to the songs are superb throughout. The outside musicians (including the singers) help expand the music while staying in the confines of the blues, country and the Stones' customary brand of rock. The resurrection of Robert Johnson's \\"Love In Vain\\" is far from being a sterile copy. It's pure inspiration as a country-blues. It's the only track that exposes their vulnerability and melancholy. The few other \\"love\\" songs, \\"Let It Bleed\\", \\"Live With Me\\" and \\"You Got The Silver\\" is complete hedonism. There's not even a line remotely suggesting any love with this sex. They concern themselves with power.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Rambler\\" shows Mick adapting the persona of a rapist. It's set to his menacing harp shrieks, Keith's eerie bottleneck flourishes and Charlie's aggressive pounding. This truly sounds unsettling and uncontrived. And the two brilliant anthems here, \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" give the aura that in the end all we have is ourselves. On \\"Gimme Shelter\\", Mick offers a chilling glimpse of the world for years to come. Merry Clayton's vocal actually augments the terror. And with \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", we must resign ourselves to what we can get. This is the only slice of redemption. It's the big brother to \\"Satisfaction\\". These are the Stones at their most visionary.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, this slams shut any hippie counterculture ideals. The Garden Period is now history and was only seemingly attainable. Jimmy Miller's production is first rate.
9113020730|5.0|After reading Stieg Larsson's first two books, I literally needed to read his third. I wasn't disappointed. Larsson drops his readers into the action immediately. We find ourselves in an emergency room picking up Lisbeth Salandar's life where we left it in his second book, The Girl Who Played with Fire. \\"The girl on the gurney could live with a piece of lead in her hip...But a piece of lead inside her brain was a trauma of a wholly different magnitude.\\" As this 599 page mystery progresses not only is it compelling in its plot, but Larsson reintroduces and gives new dimensions to the characters, particularly Lisbeth Salandar and Mikael Blomkvist. Readers should know that, although a quick read for the most part, attention has to be paid to the number of individuals Larsson places within this text- from the police detectives, to the SAPO members, to the Millennium staff members, to the \\"bad guys.\\" At times, I had to review names to be sure I understood who was who in relationships, jobs, etc. While this is fiction, Larsson bases enough of it on real life politics of Sweden to give his readers an insider's view of the machinations behind the scenes of a nation's government. I would also recommend treating Larsson's three books as one - read them in the order they were published. What a shame there won't be any more - I'll miss Lisbeth.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|2012 is an odd film.  It can be viewed on a number of levels: it brings to the public eye the old Mayan prediction that the earth and civilization as we know it will be destroyed on December 21, 2012, it is an exercise in computer generated graphics in the hands of Roland Emmerich, it poses a few questions as to what is important in life and how learning what is important is learning how to live in the now, and it is a roller coaster corny simplistic mess of a plot that sells out at every chance it gets to make a meaningful statement.<br /><br />The cast, watching the crumbling and burning of the planet, is huge. John Cusack is a satisfying hero/returned dad, Chiwetel Ejiofor represents the good in science, Oliver Platt propels the action with his usual ability to steal a scene, Woody Harelson is, well, Woody Harelson as dopey as ever, Thandie Newton and Amanda Peet add the appropriate glamour and love interests, Danny Glover makes a fine President of the USA, Johann Urb is a very screen-powerful presence as a Russian pilot, and Osric Chau makes a very positive impression as a personality the camera loves and a character with whom we can identify (he needs some important roles to allow us to further examine his potential).  And there are others equally as well cast.<br /><br />What will bother those who find a degree of credence and associated anxiety with the Mayan prediction will be sorry to see the silly manner in which 400,000 of mankind and animalkind are saved in boats to land in Africa to restart civilization.  But then this is Hollywood and Roland Emmerich tends to concentrate more on CGI than on content.  It is long, but then it is entertaining - to a point.  Grady Harp, March10
B000W91RUG|5.0|Funny and Smart, Of Course I recommend this Big Serie to all of you. 100% Satisfied in shipping and watching it.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I bought this CD because of the 'Love Story' song..but was happily surprised at how many other songs are amazing on this cd. She writes most of her own music, and quite a few of these songs have nice lyrics and really peaceful melodies :)
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Awesome. Well written, well acted, and the photography was outstanding. My favorite character had to be Thomas Jefferson (played by Stephen Dillane). Worth the time and money if you want to see things about the Revolution not tainted (too much) by Hollywood.
B0013FNC38|1.0|I really liked the song \\"im yours\\" so i bought this cd without hearing any of the other songs first.  Anyway the only other good song on this cd is \\"lucky\\" (which is very beautiful). I thought maybe I was just being too particular but I had some friends try and listen w/ me at a bachelorette party and they didnt like it either...not very good!!
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Why oh WHY couldn't they have just kept David Attenborough, a naturist and biologist, as the narrator for this? Even Sigourney Weaver's narration for Planet Earth was MUCH better than Oprah Winfrey's for Life. Weaver had a way of bringing gravity to situations, and her voice at least sounded smooth, and good; very complementary. Oprah's voice is slightly scratchy, abrasive, and she sort of sounds like a frustrated nun. Off of that, the way she speaks to you sounds like she's talking down to you; like a self-absorbed kindergarten teacher, who can't wait for the day to end. She doesn't even seem to have any passion or insight. I cannot stress enough how terrible her narrative for this show is. I was physiologically incapable of sitting through an hour of her grinding drivel.    Oprah should really stick to daytime TV and as a women's talk show host. I like what she does, as far as charity (although not so much how she publicizes it), etc. (?), but she has got to be such a money hog. Just because she was a helping hand for Planet Earth doesn't mean she should showboat all of its sequels.    Letterman might as well have been chosen as the narrator for this show!  In Canada and everywhere else, BBC stuck to the original narration from Attenborough. The US is the only one that decided to dumb up this wonderful series.
B002VECMAE|3.0|THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS probably will always maintain a rather small audience. The film is strange on every level, is filled with some fairly outrageous ideas, has more punch lines than  a standup comedian, and is populated by a strong cast of characters who seem to be thoroughly enjoying the madness of the story.  It is a shifting tale started by a lovesick reporter (Ewan McGregor) who discovers a military secret concerning the Jedi Warriors - a post Vietnam group developed by on Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), a left over hippie who developed a line of psychic spies who could read minds and control events just by thinking.  Two major members of the Jed Warriors were Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) and Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey) - the Yin and Yang/dark and light  sides of the movement.  Spill all of this into Iraq and a series of events that shows how absurd humans behave in war time and the fun never stops.  It is nutty, at times confusing in the manner in which the story is laid out, but it is always entertaining - if you like a touch of the bizarre superimposed on what was apparently a real story!  Grady Harp, March 10
1439102813|5.0|This book helps me keep focused on the person who still exists rather than the parts of the person who has vanished.
B00338QENI|5.0|I really enjoy books based on real people under extraordinary circumstances, and this book qualifies, even tho Henrietta didn't live to experience the circumstances. Author Rebecca Skloot spent years piecing together a story based on an unlikely premise, that a poor, uneducated black woman's improperly taken and used cancer cells would became the basis for most cellular scientific research through out the world.<br /><br />This is as much a story about science, the black experience in America, a family and our society as it is about the woman herself. It's done with a light but passionate touch, easily understood and told for laypersons to understand, and so compelling, one just can't put the book down until finished.
B001OQCV6A|2.0|It's another book to film adaption that will break your heart if you love the source material.    Robert Downey Jr. played himself. Which is great usually, but Holmes is too iconic a figure for that to work this time. His love interest seems to exist primarily to dispel any jokes or even ideas that Watson and Holmes are gay, which certainly they would seem without her presence. Holmes is also not the dry, tortured and grave protagonist of the books, he's more like a spoiled child who knows he can get away with anything. Further, the plot is silly. At the core of every Holmes adventure should be empirical science (that's what makes him so brilliant), and this leans too heavily on the magical side.    Somebody please ask Hollywood to stop financing Guy Ritchie already.
B000HEVALC|2.0|This album is sure to be a disappointment to anyone hoping to hear the four guys all playing on a song at once.  That never happens.  In fact, i don't believe there's a complete performance of a single song.<br />This is more like someone left a tape recorder going for an hour while these guys sat around the studio, talking and singing a few songs for each other.  Elvis dominates the conversation and does most of the singing.<br />If you're a musician, it's interesting, because you can hear Elvis, just strumming and singing spirituals, or songs of the day that he particularly likes.  Jerry Lee pipes in a few times, and i think i heard Carl Perkins once or twice as well, but never would have guessed Johnny Cash was in the room.<br />So if you're a fan of any of these guys, hoping to hear them performing together, you will be VERY disappointed.  If you're a player, who wants to know how these guys might sound if they were sitting around your living room, then go for it.
B00157NO0A|5.0|This is a great, but incomplete, companion to the terrific DVD of the Johnny Cash TV Show.  All the performances are enjoyable and some are absolute gems.  Ray Charles' killer take on Ring of Fire is worth the price of the disk all on its own (when I saw the performance on the DVD it was the one that made me wish there was also a DVD).  The Derek and the Dominos track, Kristoferson singing his own \\"Loving Her Was Easier\\" and Johnny, June, the Tennessee Three, Statler Bros and Carl Perkins on Belshazzar also stand out.  That said, you have to wonder why so many other great performances available on the DVD are left off the CD (Johnny and Bob Dylan on Girl from the North Country, Neil Young & Needle & the Damage Done,Johnny singing Sunday Morning Coming Down - which Kris K. says on the DVD made him, etc).  Maybe there are other disks in the future?  The other shortcoming are the fairly short and uninformative liner notes, which are a consistent shortfall of the posthumous JC releases.  Given that this disk and the American Recordings are co-produced by John Carter Cash it would seem reasonable to expect liner notes with some insights - in this case about the making of the Johnny Cash show, how Johnny got the great artists to appear on the show, his impressions of singing with them, how the tracks were selected, etc.  All of that said, as written in the liner notes, Johnny was groundbreaking in recording these live performances to 8-track and had the foresight to preserve them so we are lucky to have them at all - why nit-pick.  The liner notes also provide a disclaimer that the sound quality of the disk reflects the relatively poor source material but, knowing the source, the sound is quite good and more than satisfactory.  This is a treat for Johnny Cash fans and a time capsule from a unique era.  NOTE: Many of the other reviews are for the DVD of the Johnny Cash Show, not this CD.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|The low-rated reviews entirely miss the point of this CD. They mostly criticize McCartney's song selection, song arrangement or the quality of his singing. The point of the concert was to return to Shea stadium for the first time since the Beatles played there in the mid-60's and thrill the hordes of Beatles fans.  The CD is just an after-product.  And no, someone that is approaching 70 is not going to sing nearly as well as when they were in their 20's or even 50's.  Sinatra didn't.  So I'm irritated with the thoughtless comments that people make about this CD.  Even if Paul felt that the recording would be improved with auto-tune, then so what? Many, many singers use auto-tune, and you can't tell, which is the whole point of using it.  So the claims of reviewers that they \\"know\\" that auto-tune was used is bogus.  You don't know and can't tell.    Listeners should view this as being a historic recording which will never be repeated and be thankful that Paul even bothered to do it at all. 5 stars for a generous offering of 2 CDs and a DVD for not much money.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This disk is the 1080i version.<br /><br />Amazon's product description doesn't say what resolution it is, Discovery Channel's site doesn't either, and no help from BBC's site (even after I emailed them).  If there's a 1080p version out there, I don't know about it.  I've watched more than half of it and (as far as I can tell) there are no behind-the-scenes footage.<br /><br />You've probably heard raving reviews about Planet Earth already; it doesn't disappoint.  There are several scenes where the film is grainy and the resolution's not up to par for a 1080p screen but I understand that HD cameras weren't available everywhere.  The HD shots are incredible, almost surreal.  If you have surround sound or high quality headphones, some of the scenes have quite an impact.  This series is both beautiful and tough but I like that (candy-coating and censorship suck).  I've seen some of the Discovery Channel episodes but it was a while ago and I can't really say that David Attenborough is 'n' times better than Sigourney Weaver; however I don't have any trouble understanding him and his narration is good.  There's something nice about the BBC version, it's like I'm keepin' it real.<br /><br />Conclusion: get it, you won't be disappointed except for the fact that you won't be able to see any 'making of' shots.  Really though, it's still great.
B000001GK9|5.0|Having listened many great and impressive recordings of this symphony, i   still think of Karajan´s as the real and absolute reference, taking both  artistic and sound quality. Never before had the Berliner Philharmoniker   played Mahler this way, with so high standards of clarity, beauty, drama  and precision. This is the perfect Mahler 9th, and since any mahlerian  would not stay with just one recording, however this Karajan`s Mahler 9th   will be the authentic reference for ages.
B001HN69B8|4.0|Dr. Parnassus is a film that could only have come from the fecund mind of Terry Gilliam. He has earned a reputation for taking creative risks instead of making safe, mundane films. As a former Monty Python member, we can expect no less. Whether you like him or not, you must give him credit for his indomitable creative spirit and unwillingness to compromise his artistic vision, with mixed results. After giving us masterpieces like [[ASIN:B000G8NXZK Brazil]], [[ASIN:B000T44ONG Adventures of Baron Munchausen]] and [[ASIN:B0026FCNK2 12 Monkeys]], he baffled us with the disastrous and hated [[ASIN:B000H7J9S0 Brothers Grimm]]. As a result of his unyielding independence, his productions are often fraught with setbacks and colorful stories of their own. This one is no different, owing to the untimely passing of Heath Ledger, who plays Tony, one of the main characters in the film.<br /><br />His films are not for everyone and as such, he can be a bit of an acquired taste. I must admit I hated 12 Monkeys when I first saw it, but not so with Dr. Parnassus. I thoroughly enjoyed the wacky ride Gilliam took me on into the vastness of his bizarre imagination, partly because of the locale. Set in modern-day London, the story is about the misadventures of a traveling theatre troupe led by the title character, Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), a 1,000 year old ex-Eastern mystic. Everything about the stagecoach and its inhabitants has a wonderfully anachronistic look to it, like they doesn't belong in this world.<br /><br />Having made a deal with the devil, Dr. Parnassus traded immortality for something very dear to him, and now plays one game after another for souls, trying to outwit the devil and cancel his debt. Tom Waits is wonderfully devious, and dare I say it-- lovably diabolical as Parnassus's adversary, the pencil-moustached and bowler-topped Mr. Nick. If you don't like Verne Troyer, you won't like him here either as the Dr.'s trusty sidekick Percy. Lily Cole, who plays Dr. Parnassus's teenage daughter, is very lovely and easy on the eyes. I didn't mind her running around at the end in a little red dress at all! As for the whistle Tony uses to get out of predicaments, I've never seen this trick before! Very clever. I won't spoil the surprise. You'll have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />Gilliam's distinct visual style is abundantly in evidence here, with wildly imaginative sets and quirky characters. His worlds often look lived-in, chaotic (12 Monkeys, Brazil), and filled with junk. Johnny Depp described Dr. Parnassus as having a \\"crazed, dilapidated majesty\\" and that's the perfect way to sum up the look of this film. A lot of CG is used throughout to give the dream world the fantastical and exaggerated look of a cartoon. Some of the landscapes are bright and vivid like those out of a Wallace & Gromit animation or Nintendo's Mario games while others have the dark and surrealist appearance of a living Dali painting. One scene actually has a boy blasting objects with his [[ASIN:B000VXJEW6 Nintendo DS]].<br /><br />The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is Heath Ledger's last film. Gilliam fought to get it completed after Ledger's death and dedicated it to his memory, signing the closing credits: \\"A Film from Heath Ledger and friends\\". In a way, it was a labor of love. All the actors re-cast for his part were friends of Ledger, and this deserves mentioning. Three friends (Johnny Depp, Jude Law, Colin Farrell) play different representations of Tony in the dream world, and they're all too brief and the change from one Tony to another is somewhat jarring. But this discontinuity can be forgiven, given the circumstances.<br /><br />I found the film very enjoyable and definitely worth the time to watch. If you're a fan of Gilliam or any of the actors involved, it's a no-brainer.teenage daughter, is very lovely and easy on the eyes.

B000FA5TTW|5.0|this book is truely amazing. It shows you how important life is, along with a real life situation. i've cried, been surprised, and thought deeply after reading this beautiful book. and i can relate to Susie Salmon for i am also a teenager, 13 to be exact. this also informs many readers of rape, child abduction and murder. i highly recommend this book for young mature adults for this does have sexual graphic scenes. overall the ending set me to tears. an ending that concluded beautifully.

B000RIHBIE|3.0|It's a well written album but too un-original. Almost all the tracks are bands like blink182, Greenday, Linkin Park, My Chemical Romance and etc. This album is cool that it has many feels and many of them gives you the vibe of other bands that makes you say geez they ripped off from this and that band. The changes and structuring are very smooth and clever in it's sense. It takes alot of imagination to come up with some new innovative originalty not many bands are capable of that. Take for instance Dashboard Confessional almost all his songs  with his melodies are quite original. Other that....this is a fun album to listen too.
B002VECMAE|5.0|Realizing that I am not a typical viewer, I don't expect everyone to fall madly in love with this movie.  But I did.  The first time I saw it I loved it.  The next day I watched it again and fell even more deeply in love.  I had tears in my eyes at the end.  It is smart, well made, light and deep at the same time.  If you are one of the people who fall in love with this movie, you will know that, like the Jedi warriors in the film, you are part of a self selected group, a group with a certain mission in life, however vague that may seem to you.  Just by loving the movie you are doing your part.  The last movie I loved this much was \\"Groundhog Day.\\"<br /><br />I am already making plans to watch the movie over and over until I have memorized all the dialog.  It's that kind of movie, and I'm that kind of psychic nerd.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this and was also terribly saddened to know Mr. Jackson will no longer be performing here on Earth.    Keep this DVD since it is a piece of history.
0312356854|5.0|This book has very rich characters and it is written well. The author does a magnificent job of weaving the two plot lines together. The characters are very flawed and honestly written. I enjoyed the book and it will make you sad and thankful throughout reading it--but it also makes you learn and not just about history but human nature too.

0446569895|5.0|Quite simply one of the best rock bios out there. (at least in regards to the ones I've read)    Covers his childhood, his early years bumming about, how black sabbath came about, the rise of sabbath, the fall of sabbath, his solo career, how he met sharon (and where she came from as it were), and so much more.    If you hate ozzy reading this book won't make you love him BUT will make you realize he's a human and not that bad of a guy. If you love ozzy, this is unlikely to change your opinion of him. If you are merely a casual fan of ozzy but also a fan of music you should read this book. If you're not a fan you might find something here that is enjoyable but than that depends on what kind of books you are into reading i guess.    Must read for everyone who IS a fan though.

B000QXDED6|4.0|300 tells the story, first recorded by the ancient historian Herodotus, of 300 Spartan Warriors, led by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler); who fought off the much larger army of King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) at Thermopylae. Though all 300 Spartans perished at 'the hot gates' of Thermopylae, and thus there were no witnesses to tell what actually happened, we can only imagine. Director Zack Snyder (The Watchmen) and Graphic Novelist Frank Miller (Sin City), have, however, done a great job of bringing the ancient legend to the silver screen.<br /><br />------------<br />Queen Gorgo: Spartan!<br />King Leonidas: Yes, my lady?<br />Queen Gorgo: Come back with your shield, or on it.<br />King Leonidas: Yes, my lady.<br />===================<br /><br />It is a shame that lately Gerard Butler has become the go-to guy for lame romantic comedies like The Bounty Hunter or The Ugly Truth, as the gruff but loveable leading man. I suppose he is having fun, as you can't pick up a tabloid without reading about his backstage and H-wood party exploits with Madonna and all and sundry, but it seems like a tragic waste. He is going the Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers) route rather than the Russell Crowe (Gladiator) highway. In other words, Butler brought a lot of depth to his character in 300, but didn't live up to his potential by later choosing more demanding dramatic roles.<br /><br />----------<br />Earth! render back from out thy breast<br />A remnant of our Spartan dead!<br />Of the three hundred grant but three,<br />To make a new Thermopylae!<br /><br />~ Lord Byron, from Don Juan, Canto iii, Stanza 86, 7<br />================<br /><br />300, like Starship Troopers (I'm thinking more of the Robert Heinlen book than the movie which lampooned it), posits a militarized society, where young boys are examined for any defects, and if any are found, they are left to die. Brought up hard, made to fight from an early age, they must fight to survive. This upbringing culminates in a rite of passage whereby the young Spartan must confront a wolf with only a spear to defend himself. The real foe for him is fear. He must conquer his fear so that he can fight with a clear head.<br /><br />-----<br />Dilios: When the boy was born, like all Spartans, he was inspected.<br />==========<br /><br />Though it seems that the rigid discipline of military life is a kind of slavery, paradoxically, the idea of democracy was born in Ancient Greece. They consider themselves free men and fight to defend that freedom.<br /><br />--------<br />O love, O celibate.<br />Nobody but me<br />Walks the waist high wet.<br />The irreplaceable<br />Golds bleed and deepen, the mouths of Thermopylae.<br /><br />~ Sylvia Plath, suicide at 31, faces her own Thermopylae walking in the garden in the poem \\"Letter in November\\"<br />==============<br /><br />---------<br />Persian: A thousand nations of the Persian empire descend upon you. Our arrows will blot out the sun!<br />Stelios: Then we will fight in the shade.<br />=================<br /><br />-----------<br />\\"Go tell it\\" -- What a Message --<br />To whom -- is specified --<br />Not murmur -- not endearment --<br />But simply -- we -- obeyed --<br />Obeyed -- a Lure -- a Longing?<br />Oh Nature -- none of this --<br />To Law -- said sweet Thermopylae<br />I give my dying Kiss --<br /><br />~ In Emily Dickinson's \\"'Go tell it' -- what a message\\"<br />==========================<br /><br />The Bottomline is that 300 can be enjoyed strictly as an action film, with lots of thrilling battle scenes to get the blood pumping, but it is also a very vivid and graphic telling of an ancient tale that is referred to often by poets, such as Lord Byron, T.S. Elliot, Sylvia Plath, A.E. Houseman, and Emily Dickinson. It is a very inspiring story, and centuries later, King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans at Thermopylae are still remembered.<br /><br />------------<br />Xerxes: You Greeks take pride in your logic. I suggest you employ it. Consider thebeautiful land you so vigorously defend. Picture it reduced to ash at my whim! Consider the fate of your women!<br />Spartan King Leonidas: Clearly you don't know our women!

B002RAREAK|2.0|Um I was highly disappointed with this album. I've been jamming to the leaked songs from the album that I've heard the last couple of months. I was like wow I'm really feeling \\"Little Freak\\", \\"OMG\\", and \\"Hey Daddy\\". I was so excited because these are the tracks that really fit who Usher is. I go buy the album and I listen to it and I'm like WTF. Sometimes you have to let a  song grow on you so I listen to it again and I still feel the sameway. There were 4 to maybe 5 good tracks spread inbetween a bunch of Bull. The Confessions Part 3 song \\"Foolin Around\\" has got to be the WORST Usher track I've ever heard. It wasn't like this album was rushed so I don't understand why it was so bad. This CD is one of the reasons why at one point I stopped buying CD's all together.  The highlights of this album were..  Hey Daddy  Little Freak  Okay  OMG  and Papers.  Usher did a lot to regain his musical swagger but he falls way short with this album as a whole.

B002RSDW80|5.0|For everyone who likes a good biographical flick about 2 amazing women, this movie is fantastic, romantic and funny!!!
B002NXSRW0|5.0|This move was awesome.  I think that there should had more action then just talking about the past and how things came to be.  Very actor played their part perfectly.  The story line was about right for me to gain my attention.  The special effects were sweet.  However I think that they shouldn't have had more technological weaponry.  It would have been more better feel of this move if they went with the weapons that were in the 80's or 90's cartoon series of G.I. Joe.  I think that this was a well done movie picture.
1401323820|5.0|I'm a big fan of the TV show, so naturally, I had to read Heat Wave. To my delight, it read like the show! Great characterization and snappy dialogue and just the right amount of (sexual) tension. Can't wait for the next \\"Richard Castle\\" book.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I thought that this newest edition of Star Trek was one of the coolest movies that I saw.  I'm a big sci-fi fan and I loved the special effects were pretty awesome.  However I didn't notice but I've heard that this movie of Star Trek had the story line that some how screwed up between the series and all of the other movies.  I didn't really care.  The character that were in this movie captured the future characters like spock, bones, Etc.  I even thought that people that played Kurt was very well played.  It tells how Kurt got into trouble on a constant bases very well as well.  The actors played their parts in the movie excellently.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|So far the Pixar films look fantastic on Blu-Ray.  I own both Toy Story movies, Cars, Up, and Wall-e.  All the transfers are first rate and will show off your Hi-def TV and sound system.  The Toy Story movies are 2 of the best in the Pixar franchise.  Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are fantastic as the voices of the lead characters, and the stories themselves are fun for all ages.  There are even some jokes that only adults would understand (\\"He has laser envy\\") but the funny lines are fast and furious to keep the attention focused for everyone.  One of my favorite characters is the neurotic dinosaur toy but they are all great and have distinctive personalities.
1569242739|5.0|This cute, compact cookbook is loaded with beautiful photos and every recipe I have made has been wonderful. There is information for the inexperienced baker and tons of inspiration for an old dog like myself. At this point I've pretty much stuck to the basic recipes: Your Basic Chocolate Cupcakes, Golden Vanilla Cupcakes, Lemony Vanilla Cupcakes, and Sexy Low Fat Vanilla Cupcakes. A bit off the beaten path were the Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cupcakes, and Chocolate Stout Cupcakes, both delicious. I still have many more cupcakes to make but wanted to post this review. My only \\"complaint\\" is the yield of 12 cupcakes. I share these delicious vegan treats at work, so there are never any left over, and may I add, never any complaints. One other thing - I am a graphic designer by trade so I am sensitive to how a book is designed. They did a great job - well laid out, easy to read, no weird fonts and colors that are hard to read, liberal use of color photos throughout. This is a beautiful, very functional cookbook. I can't recommend it highly enough.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I live in a REGION A Blu-ray country (same as USA), but bought LIFE from Amazon.co.uk. UK is a REGION B Blu-ray country, and actually, Amazon.co.uk Helpdesk told me that it is a REGION B set. BUT, to my pleasant surprise, the UK Attenborough set HAS NO BLU-RAY REGION CODE!!    So, I could play it on my Region A Blu-ray player! I was actually prepared to buy a UK Blu-ray player if did not.    I could not wait for the June 1 release in the USA, so I bought from Amazon.co.uk. I am very satisfied with this purchase, especially that the British pound has dropped in value so much that it even cost less than if I ordered from Amazon.com.    Perhaps Amazon could confirm to all its customers about the Region code of the UK set.    BTW, people who love BBC nature documentaries would love the UK Attenborough set. Diehard Oprah fans who love her in ANY kind of program may wish to wait for the June release.    So, no point arguing which is the better set.    I think the makers of this documentary have made a smart move -- get BOTH the nature lovers and Oprah fans to buy the set. Clever.
0439023521|5.0|I'm easy when it comes to dystopian, post apocalyptic fiction- LOVE it- but this novel goes beyond it's setting. Populated with empathetic, engaging characters and edge of your seat PANIC, it's so well done I would have enjoyed it even set in the here and now.<br /><br />But it's not. Taking place, I assume, sometime in the future or in some sort of alternate timeline, the United States are no longer states, but districts- and those in control seem to be doing everything they can to keep them less than united.<br /><br />Each district has a purpose- to supply the wealthy, well-fed capital with all that it wants and needs- with some of the districts less thought of than others.<br /><br />Katniss comes from the poorest district, District 12- the district which supplies coal to the capital.<br /><br />Katniss, her mother and her sister don't have much, but what they do have they have Katniss to thank for. With her father dead and her mother weakened by depression, Katniss and her family have never had a rich morsel of food their entire life but she keeps hunger just barely at bay with illegal hunting and clever bartering.<br /><br />On the biggest day of the year, the day the Capital forces all youth to take part in a drawing for The Hunger Games, Katniss is wary of being one of the ones chosen from her district- as the more times you make it to the lottery, the more chances your number will be called- but she's thankful that her little sister, Primrose, who's only coming to the games for the first time, will more than likely not be chosen.<br /><br />Fear strikes her heart when low and behold Prim's name is indeed called out and before she knows it, Katniss volunteers to take her beloved little sister's place as a contender for a survival game that will mean certain death.<br /><br />The games are cruel, deadly, and put on for no purpose but to entertain the masses and Katniss is about to make history- if she doesn't die in the first five seconds!<br /><br />I loved this book! I'm not a huge Young Adult fiction fan, but The Hunger Games captured my imagination from the first words- and if you are a sci fi/ fantasy lover, you'll be hooked just as quickly! And even if you aren't a sci fi fan- I can pretty much guarantee you'll enjoy it for the the \\"fight-the-power\\" theme in this book crosses all boundaries.<br /><br />Katniss is a great heroine and one to be emulated- unlike another popular YA character we know **cough** Bella **cough, cough**- she's fierce in protecting her family and those she loves, she has a noble sense of honor, she's cleverly independent- but don't think she won't do whatever she has to, to survive.

Less of a focus on lyrics, but still the guitar is great, so that makes up for the lyrics easily.  The album received bad reviews by critics, but who cares, they're are to fools of music.    If you want a good Pink Floyd collection, get this!
006135323X|1.0|I do have to say that the first chapter is absolutely brilliant. However, the rest of the book is complete garbage. Stating obvious facts that even a five year old knows is not good enough to call it a book. For example, this book dedicates a whole chapter based on a social experiment to \\"prove\\" that... ready for this?... a 20-something college male does stupid stuff if sexually aroused compared to himself in a normal state. So, save some money and time!
031604461X|4.0|While I'll always have problems with certain details in the Twilight Saga, there is no denying all of the books are engrossing. Why else would I, and so many other Twilight complainers, continue to read these books when we know parts are going to aggravate us?<br /><br />Bella continues to beg for sex in Breaking dawn. She's in extreme pain, but won't make a sound for fear she'll upset Edward. And that name, for the love of all that's good, why? By the end of the book Bella finally manages to grow a backbone and Edward seems to be toning the controlling down a notch.If only she could have had a little more self-confidence throughout the series, I might have been able to love it as others do.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn has a good resolution, but I felt slightly let down by the big conflict scene. Shouldn't someone or something be lost after all the build-up? It was a little too happily-ever-after for my taste.<br /><br />What I see as flaws, serious fans of the Saga consider pure gold. Breaking Dawn isn't a literary masterpiece in my mind, but it was just as good as Twilight and much better than New Moon and Eclipse.
B001GQSY5K|3.0|This movie has some good points, such as the animation, and some bad points, like the lack of intro into the story.  This movie was made to introduce the Cartoon Network series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and that is what it does.  If you like the cartoon series you will want to watch this movie, but it doesn't seem strong enough to me to be a stand alone movie like the original six movies.  It is more like a longer version of the cartoon series.  In my opinion it was not meant to be part of the story of the original six movies, but a side story.

They are able to go into more depth with the characters and really start to care what happens to them.  My son was not happy when he later found out that Anakin become Darth Vader.  This cartoon brings Star Wars to a new generation, and makes it cool again.  This is also a cartoon that my husband and I can sit down and watch and not be bored or annoyed.  This is not a strictly for boys cartoon either, my daughter love the Ashoka character.  My kids are constantly playing Star Wars games now, and look forward to Friday nights when the new show comes out.  This DVD set also includes some neat extras, including art work and where some of the ideas for episodes came from.  If you liked the original Star Wars you won't be sorry to pick this set up.
B002ONC9NC|4.0|A suburban London teen finds her traditional education replaced by something slightly more sinister when an older, more worldly suitor sweeps her off of her feet while placing her future in jeopardy. London, 1961: 16-year-old Jenny is smart, attractive, and eager to start her adult life. She's grown tired of the familiar adolescent routine, so when urbane newcomer David appears in town, Jenny senses a rare opportunity to shake things up a bit. Quickly falling under David's spell, the impressionable Jenny begins accompanying her newfound beau to classical concerts, art auctions, crowded pubs, and dinners that stretch into the small hours of the night. Although it is slow, it is a large array of emotions. It is deep, emotional, beautiful, and heartbreaking. Set in 1960s England, 16 year old Jenny is caught in a whirlwind of the \\"Adult life\\". She is torn between the adult world and her childhood, and her scholarship to Oxford. Peter Saarsgard and Carey Mulligan are fantastic.  This is such a good movie, but it's definitely not for everyone.

She pulls the reader out of the 21st century and puts them square in the middle of the century and time about which she is writing. She gives you an understanding of the times that made men and the men that made the times. She offers you portraits of the major and minor personalities that make you feel as if you know them and lived around them.

B001HN694K|5.0|Tim Burton and Lewis Carrol's \\"Alice\\" books seemed, when this project was announced, to be a perfect combination. I waited with great anticipation to see the result and I know many others did too - and I was not disappointed.  The story follows an adult Alice, who is at a crossroads after being proposed to her by a wealthy heir, but one whom she feels nothing for. At just this moment, she espies the White Rabbit, who leads her into Wonderland, a strange land that she visited in her childhood, but believed to be just a dream. There she meets the familiar characters of the Mad Hatter and his tea drinking posse, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Caterpillar and the Cheshire Cat. They have been waiting hopefully for her return, as she is the one who will end the rule of the paranoid and violent Red Queen, a character amalgam of the Red Qeen from \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" and The Queen of Hearts from \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\". She eventualy becomes the champion of the benevolent but exiled White Queen and is set on a collision course with the Red Queen and her forces, including the sly and mean-spirited Knave of Hearts (who seems to amalgamate The Knave of Hearts from \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" and The Red Knight from \\"Through the Looking Glass\\") and the fearsome Jabberwocky, the dragon that protects the Red Queen from challenges.   Many, it sems, were disappointed with this. Some complain that it eschews the books fragmented plot in favour of a quest structure, while others complain of the lack of storyline. Burton, by his own admission focuses on characters and imagery rather than story. This is a valid approach as cinema is a visual medium - not like a novel. This being said, I was surprised that Burton was more interested in a version with a story than the fragmented original, although this may not have been his decision alone. The result, however, works. There is just enough of a story to give the characters more of a history and motivation - a feature of Burton's previous film adaptations of \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" and \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" - in which characters were given more depth by introducing more of a back story. Yes, as many have pointed out, the film does utilise the monomyth structure as many other recent fantasy epics have - but stories do tend to use it - and this is not the first \\"Alice\\" adaptation to do so. The film has to be judged on the merits of how it achieves its own goal, and Burton's key is in using his distinctive imagination to give this \\"Alice\\" and this monomyth its own peculiar feel. Some may miss elements of Carrol's nonsensical wit that are not here, but there is sufficient essence of Carrol in the language of the characters and the confusion Alice faces in dealing with many of them. It must be remembered that much of the plot is derived from \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" which has more structure than \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". The story of \\"The Jabberwocky\\", a poem from \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" is also used in the plot structure - introducing the key folkloric motif of the special weapon - the Vorpal Sword. The brilliant result of this is in creating a new, surreal version of the monomyth filtered through the sensibilities of Carrol and Burton.  The CGI I is used sparringly and has the weighted feel of Burton's stop motion work, making it feel more real and much warmer than much of the cold, slick CGI of other films. Some say that the 3D was tacked on and not integral, I offer other adjectives: unintruseive and understated. I ddo not want to walk away from a film with my memory focused on the special effects - to me there is a great failing in the characters if this is the case. Burton's brilliant visual quality stands out in every frame of the film - beautifully tonal and detailed. Slightly gothic and with a wonderful technicolour palette.  All actors are outstanding. The CGI characters are voiced to perfection. Wasikowska is a curious and assertive presence without gushing ather surroundings like an Alice from a bad panto adaptation. Depp is a delighfully nuanced, bi-polar Mad Hatter with the right blen of whimsy and psychological damage. Bonham-Carter is a wicked Red Queen, delightfully spoiled and OTT, but also showing the damage that made her a monster. Ann Hathaway is a warm but motivated presence who has done exceelent work in the building of her character. Some find the characters a little cold - I find an emotional honesty rather than the sentimental syrup many expect from family fantasy and Hollywood movies in general.  This is a wonderful fantasy that harkens back to great fantasy films like \\"Labrynth\\", The Dark Crystal\\", \\"The Princess Bride\\", \\"Return to Oz\\" and even Disney's earlier animations such as \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" \\"Snow White\\" and their original \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" - that were unafraid to be stylistically bold, slightly wierd, a bit scary, very whimsical and a lot of fun!

That, coupled with the amazing new products makes this a plan I believe I can follow for a lifetime. I've lost 8 lbs in 17 days eating anywhere from 1500 to 1800(sometimes more) a day. I've lost 3.75 inches altogether. I just started and exercise program 2 week ago, and I have the energy to do it! My craving for carbohydrates is practically non-existent. That didn't happen right away, and after 2 week on induction, I've turned down foods I never thought I could. You owe it to yourself to give this a try!

B0036EH40Q|5.0|If you are like me, a directors cut can totally ruin a film for you.  Tombstone is by far one of my favorite films that I owned on Video Cassette, Letterbox DVD, and Anamorphic DVD.  I had to get rid of the Anamorphic b/c it was the DC.  I couldn't watch it without cringing every time a new scene or cut hit me.  I guess I am one of those cranky film preservationists. Between the timeless story and the power of the ensemble cast, Tombstone is one of the greatest.  Whether you a fan of westerns or not, it's a sure bet.  To my satisfaction, (according to imdb.com) the directors cut clocks in at 134, the original 130.  So according to the stats here, this here blu-ray should be the Theatrical Version.  I look forward to watching this movie in HD in the coming weeks.

B002VECMAE|3.0|An affable but toothless satire of both 1970s New Ageism and contemporary military privatization, The Men Who Stare at Goats subsists entirely on the charm of its leading men.  When those leading men are George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey, and Ewan McGregor, that's enough to carry it most of the way through.  Each actor plays his familiar persona to the hilt.  Clooney does the charming, self-confident dim bulb bit he's been perfecting since [[ASIN:B00003CXRM O Brother, Where Art Thou]].  Bridges reprises [[ASIN:B00007ELEL the Dude]].  Spacey is a prissy martinet.  And McGregor--actually Ewan McGregor's charisma is muted here, but then he's been saddled with the double burdens of playing the straight man and doing an American accent.  The Men Who Stare at Goats ambles along, eventually overstaying its welcome by only ten minutes or so.  Sometimes it's fine for a movie to give you exactly what you want.
B001LF347E|4.0|I'd say that this series is a replacement for the other Medieval-era BBC production \\"Robin Hood\\" that was cancelled after its 3rd season.  That said, it's not bad, (minus the less than stellar CG effects.)  I caught a couple episodes of Season 1 on the SyFy Channel during a pre-Season 2 marathon, and despite the low budget CG effects, the production values of the rest of the show like the costume and set department is not bad.  Acting is also pretty good too, but not quite as good as say the Robin Hood series, but acceptable, from what I've seen.<br /><br />But I will say this though...why is it is that all these shows like this, always go the teen-age angst route?  Can we not have adult-driven genre shows like this?  A darker adult Camelot action-adventure/drama would be interesting.  And spending a bit more on the CG effects.  At least on par with the series \\"Legend of the Seeker\\".  Which again has a young main cast, minus Bruce Spence of course, but to me, that series works well, with all of its supporting cast.
B001UV4XWY|3.0|I found Richard Kelly's cult smash [[ASIN:B001JNNDBA Donnie Darko]] compelling if kinda dumb, but was taken with his audacious style and willingness to cram in more ideas than a feature film could possibly hold.  The Box has even more audacity, though it's also dumber, and though by its end the movie had tipped towards the latter for me, I still enjoyed the ride.  As in Darko, Kelly serves up a rich stew of atmospheric creepiness, martyrdom melodrama, lovingly recreated period detail from the recent past (there's no particular reason the story has to take place in Virginia in 1976, but that ends up being a cool place to hang out), some clunky imagery (the CGI water coffins here recall the blurry chest worms I thought looked dumb in D.D.---what is it with Kelly and translucence?), some absolutely stunning imagery (the wordless chase though the library is an immaculately eerie set piece), and a broadly sketched cosmological backstory that works best if you don't think about it too much.  But the most audacious move of all is the choice of source material.  The Box started life as a Richard Matheson short story that was later adapted into an episode for the mid-1980s Twilight Zone series that felt padded at 30 minutes.  And somehow Kelly manages to turn this wisp of a premise into a sprawling, overstuffed near-epic.    Overall, it was worth it, but I'm not sure how much of my enjoyment came from the The Box itself and how much came from rooting for its director.  A wide-eyed loopiness suffuses everything Kelly does---he's like an insanely talented [[ASIN:0767846869 Mark Borchardt]].  Watching his distinctive quirks overwhelm any material he works with is fun, but now I'd like to see what happens if he [[ASIN:B0011VIO3W reined it in]] just a bit.
B002RAREAK|3.0|On [[ASIN:B002RAREAK Raymond v. Raymond]], Usher attempts to \\"revive his swagger,\\" something many failed to perceive on 2008's underrated and underwhelming [[ASIN:B0015519VS Here I Stand]].  The album does do some good to give the singer (whose most successful album [[ASIN:B0002ZYDKQ Confessions]] sold nearly 10 million copies in the U.S.) a revisit to his glory days.  The problem is, 'Raymond vs. Raymond' doesn't feel nearly as cohesive or as convincing as 'Confessions' and at times it pales against 'Here I Stand' (I'll admit I was one of few people that actually liked 'Here I Stand').  It isn't bad by any means, and Usher sounds as solid as ever, but there is a certain 'cohesiveness' that is lacking.  I don't think people will remember this album, despite its notable moments.  Even the promotion up until the release seems understated to an extent.  And even worse,  there is no \\"Burn,\\" \\"Yeah,\\" or \\"U Don't Have To Call\\" caliber hit.  Again, it isn't a bad album, but it doesn't flow as good as previous Usher albums and the end has a few \\"giveaways\\" that could have been shaved off.<br /><br />The album opens incredibly awkwardly in my opinion with the quirky \\"Monstar,\\" which I have still yet to figure out.  Compared to \\"Yeah\\" or \\"Love In This Club\\", it just feels less credible;  both of those were #1 hits.  \\"Monstar\\" is well produced, but the vocals are hard to decipher and you feel like it is more of a production showcase than a track to grasp onto for songwriting/lyrical content.  \\"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)\\" resurrects any lost swagger Usher had, though it merges a more \\"grown-n-sexy\\" vibe than anything that would have appeared on 'Confessions'.  But one must remember, Usher is in his early 30s now.  \\"Hey Daddy\\" still successfully shows a more youthful side of Usher than most of the tracks from 'Here I Stand', save for \\"Love In This Club.\\"  \\"There Goes My Baby\\" is clearly slated in the adult-R&B vein, but not so much that it neglects a more youthful crowd.  It is pure contemporary R&B that should appeal to a crossover R&B audience.  \\"Lil Freak\\" featuring Nicki Minaj, is most aligned with Usher's \\"clubby\\" past and makes for the album's valedictory track.  If any track restores Usher's \\"swagger\\", it is the Stevie Wonder sampling, Nicki Minaj featured \\"Lil Freak\\".  Genius.<br /><br />Usher keeps the momentum going with the Ludacris featured \\"She Don't Know\\", another standout.  \\"OMG\\" featuring will.i.am isn't bad either, though it is pretty predictable writing from the Black-Eyed Peas frontman. Still, it is pleasant and provides similar effects like the cut from 'Here I Stand.' \\"Mars v. Venus\\" and \\"Pro Lover\\" are strong cuts, if they have slightly less identity than \\"Lil Freak\\" or \\"Hey Daddy\\".  \\"Papers\\" easily stands out, just as the single did when it was first released.  The production is understated just enough and the songwriting perfect.  \\"So Many Girls\\", like \\"Mars v. Venus\\" or \\"Pro Lover\\" is a solid cut, if less enjoyable than the \\"cream of the crop\\" tracks from this album.  Remaining tracks \\"Guilty\\" (featuring T.I.), \\"Okay\\", and \\"Making Love (Into the Night)\\" wouldn't necessarily be missed if they'd been cut, with \\"Guilty\\" being the strongest of the three.<br /><br />Overall, 'Raymond v. Raymond' is a step in the right direction, I guess, but it is a bit 'all over the place' organizationally speaking.  For listeners, I say take it for what it is and not 'cohesively' as there is no clearly defined narrative like 'Confessions' or even to some extent 'Here I Stand'.  Like T.I.'s 'dichotomy' set ([[ASIN:B000Q3646A T.I. vs T.I.P.]], it has its share of ambitions and inconsistencies.

B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|As with every Bruce Willis film that I have ever seen, this one was well worth watching.  Being an avid sci-fi fan, the premise was interesting and did not disappoint.  If you like sci-fi and Bruce Willis then this is a must see.
B002RAREAK|4.0|After watching Usher toss out a slew of singles and make appearances in places he never would have one, two, or even five years ago, nearly convinced me that Raymond v Raymond was the tepid waste of time he apparently feared it would be. I must admit that I never saw \\"Confessions\\" as this EPIC album (it was good, but I'd toss about five songs to make it perfect), but knowing that after the failure of \\"Here I Stand,\\" he was making an attempt to recapture those glory days made me want to give Usher's new album a chance.<br /><br />In this tough musical climate, Raymond v Raymond's apparent downfall is that it hasn't kept up with the times. Oh, there's an attempt with \\"OMG\\" (which I do love) featuring will.i.am's midas touch, but what made \\"Confessions\\" so revolutionary was the way in which Usher combined the then-popular crunk music with R&B. Nowadays, it's all about electronica/dance, a genre in which silky smooth r&b singers like Usher or Monica or even Beyonce, just don't fit. However, Raymond vs Raymond's strength is that Usher keeps it simple, regardless of his few attempts to pull in some electronica and crunk, and R vs R is a buttery and sensual R&B album.<br /><br />Before I review the album I have to say that I rearranged the tracks because the current arrangement makes the album seem all over the place. As it stands, here is my tracklist: So Many Girls, Hey Daddy, Guilty, Mars vs Venus, Lil Freak, She Don't Know, OMG, There Goes My Baby, Okay, Foolin' Around, Papers, Monstar, Pro Lover, Making Love (Into the Night), More (if you're feeling eh about the album, I suggest doing this). Thankfully, Usher retains a few of the people who made \\"Confessions\\" a really good album and ropes in a few unfamiliar faces who ultimately wrote and produced some of the best tracks. Usher's signature sound is that of a smooth playboy lover who nonetheless makes his current paramour feel special, and the majority of the songs successfully play on this image. There is the obligatory autobiographical song \\"Papers,\\" which actually drags the album down, IMO--I'm less interested in his personal drama than just good music--and the aforementioned attempts at keeping up with current trends (Lil Freak, a good song, but with sub-par rapper Nicki Minaj; OMG; So Many Girls) and regressions to past trends (crunk with She Don't Know). However, the album has tons of energy--sexual and fun--though there does exist a hint of desperation for relevance beneath the surface of each song. I would recommend this for Usher fans and even people who long for the days of \\"Confessions\\"--I just wish Usher had come with all his swagger and confidence because Raymond v Raymond is a worthy album.<br /><br />Standout tracks:<br /><br />There Goes My Baby<br />Guilty<br />Okay<br />OMG<br />Pro Lover<br />Mars vs Venushical song \\"Papers,\\" which actually drags the album down, IMO--I'm less interested in his personal drama than just good music--and the aforementioned attempts at keeping up with current trends (Lil Freak, a good song, but with sub-par rapper Nicki Minaj; OMG; So Many Girls) and regressions to past trends (crunk with She Don't Know).

B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|I suspect that a book so overly hyped as this one and now with a film adaptation out at cinemas is likely to suffer from a critical backlash similar to a Dan Brown novel and I can see that happening in the reviews here. The sales figures are about as close as the two get however (and I'm being a little unkind even making the comparison as they are so different).<br /><br />This book is of a very different style to that which the standard English or American author would write and as such it take a little getting used to. Also, being translated to English, I think it loses something as in places it does feel a little contrived.<br /><br />Having made these criticisms though, I thoroughly enjoyed the slow burning plot and the intricate back stories of the characters that are built up during the book; effectively playing out three separate plots as it goes along. The complexity of the main plot, the search for the missing Harriet, added to my enjoyment as it really allows you to get absorbed into their thinking as they go through their investigation.

B002VKE1K2|2.0|I was stuck in a hotel room and made the mistake of ordering this movie not realizing it was yet another of the failed attempts to recreate whatever \\"magic\\" was generated by the Blair Witch Project.

B0036TGSR6|5.0|Sure not to be included at any American Enterprise Institute (read: neoconservative) awards banquet or used as a CIA recruitment film, Roman Polanski is at his realpolitick best with \\"The Ghost Writer.\\"   Ewan McGregor plays \\"The Ghost\\" very well. We hear his actual name early in the film but Polanski cleverly makes us forget it after McGregor's character claims to have no family and is repeatedly called \\"man\\" by his client - former British Prime Minister Adam Lange (played by Pierce Bosnan). Brosnan plays the dodgy pol to a tee, showing us that political thrillers may be his cuppa tea. It's Brosnan's best movie work since \\"The Thomas Crown Affair.\\" (Sorry, Pierce, but Daniel Craig and Timothy Dalton are better at playing James Bond).   Polanski neatly hides the underlying problem in plain sight - The British PM's name resembles that of the headquarters of a foreign intelligence service. This is Polanski taking a John le Carre-esqe poke at Tony Blair and his Cool Britainnia and its kneeling posture vis a vi W. Bush's U.S. during the Iraq War. Think: Blair House in Washington isn't named after Tony Blair but it ought to be.   As always, Polanski's room of ideas and history is handsomely furnished. He pays tribute to past espionage thrillers in casting Timothy Hutton (\\"The Falcon and The Snowman\\") as Lange's lawyer. We recall Polanski's masterpiece - \\"Chinatown\\" - when the great Eli Wallach (\\"The Two Jakes\\") steps out from behind the door of an old sea shack. The curve-ball ending of \\"The Ghost Writer\\" isn't on par with \\"Chinatown\\" but it's compelling nonetheless.   The writer/director even manages a rehabilitation of the non-partisan press. The Ghost represents the faceless print media that Rush Limbaugh and friends love to complain about but couldn't live without. On behalf of those not likely to become a Woodward and/or Bernstein we thank you, Roman.   The Richard Rycart character bears a strong resemblance to Robin Cook, a minister sacked by Blair for not being sufficiently pro-American. If this film gets London to reassess \\"the special relationship\\" then John Bull-y for the UK.   Polanski also has a veiled message for Jews and Israelis in that the person pulling Lange's strings has the same name as a revered historical figure that converted to Judaism and became, as it were, more Jewish than the \\"regular\\" Jews themselves. A beautiful story that but also a teaching about zeal applicable to today's Middle East. Interestingly, Polanski gives this person's recruiter the same name as the most famous Jewish convert to Christianity, a point that Christians and especially Christian Zionists should reflect on.   The lesson is for Jews and Israelis to put their faith in what Russell Kirk called the permanent things (G-d and Torah) and that perpetual conversion to Americanism is a recipe for trouble with Arabs and Muslims. The Holy Land will find peace by being a multiethnic spiritual crossroads (\\"My House shall be a house for all peoples,\\" G-d told Isaiah) and not as The Jewish State or as Little Apartheid America.   But just as you're ready to join Israel's Peace Now movement, Polanski reverses field with some Kissinger-type wisdom - Lange's rant to The Ghost about airport security while they're flying on Lange's private jet (the former PM's near last words) should be taken seriously.   Polanski's message sounds notes from Ernst Mach's intellectual symphony - the world is always as we find it at that given instant and we can't wish that away. Like it or not, the past is a powerful ghost.
B002RAREAK|4.0|Usher's sixth studio album, \\"Raymond V Raymond\\" is a solid album for Usher and music in general.  This album is a good mix of his previous two albums, \\"Confessions\\" and \\"Here I Stand.\\"   What is most likable about the record is that Usher gives listeners plenty of party/upbeat tracks, such as \\"Little Freak\\" featuring Nicki Minaj, \\"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)\\",\\"She Don't Know\\" featuring Ludacris, as well as his signature ballads like \\"There Goes My Baby,\\" \\"Papers\\" and \\"Making Love (Into The Night).\\"  His guest appearances are on point, with T.I. showing up on \\"Guilty,\\" Ludacris on \\"She Don't Know,\\" Will.I.Am on \\"OMG\\" and Nicki Minaj on \\"Little Freak.\\" All of the guests shine, however, Minaj is by far the best in this case.  Usher is focused on this album, touching on issues including love, sex and cheating, much like his 2004 \\"Confessions\\" album.   Flaws with this album is the previously mentioned \\"OMG\\" featuring Will.I.Am. The song sounds like it was recorded by The Black Eyed Peas for their \\"The E.N.D.\\" record, but was cut and then given to Usher. It seems a little out of place.  Also why was the song \\"More,\\" which he performed during the NBA All Star game and used as a promotional single, not on the phyiscal album? It is easily one of the best recorded songs by Usher in these album sessions and would have been better than \\"OMG\\" or \\"OKAY.\\"  Overall, if you like Usher, you'll like this album. It's not his greatest, but it's another solid body of work. He proves he hasn't lose his touch with this record. Anyone new to Usher's music should start with \\"Confessions.\\"
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I was not familiar at all with Mumford and Sons, until I saw them in Rolling Stone as one of the \\"Top New Bands of 2010.\\"  So I went on YouTube and found a couple of their videos, and realized that I REALLY liked this band's sound.  Not easy to describe, I guess sort of a mix of acoustic old-timey/folk-rock/bluegrass.  But even though they are mainly acoustic, the harmonies and soaring instrumentation (many of the songs start softly and build to a big finish) remind me of a more folk-style Arcade Fire.  However I must say I much prefer Marcus Mumford's world-weary vocal style to Win Butler's David Byrne-type whining.    All in all this is a very strong work by a young band, which leaves me excited to see what they will do next.  Standout tracks include the driving \\"Little Lion Man\\", the lovely \\"Winter Winds\\", and \\"Awake My Soul\\" with its soaring almost gospel-esque chorus.    This CD has gotten very positive reviews in the musical press overall, except for the music snobs at Pitchfork who inexplicably panned it.  Ignore them and buy this CD by this talented young band.
B0002X1JKU|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone who has invested in the stock market or is thinking about it. The advices in this book are so simple and logical, yet so difficult to follow in practice because you get caught in the market psychology. I'm sure if everyone followed this book wholeheartedly we would all be richer and we would not see things like the dotcom bubble or the current financial crisis. Furthermore every chapter ends with some comments and updates that makes it relevant even for today's investors (remember this book is almost 40 years old), but still the advices stand the test of time.    I would also like to point out that this book is about value-investment, the idea to find sound companies selling at a bargain, and not technical analysis. But even though you believe in technical analysis I would still recommend reading this book too.    So pick this book up and read it thoroughly before you start investing and follow the advices, else you're almost guaranteed to lose money in the long run!
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I agree with everyone here. This amazing series is ruined by Oprah.  I wonder how much money was wasted on getting her to narrate?
B00000JPYD|5.0|If you are a fan of edgy, blues rock, soulful deep vocals (Dewar), incredible guitar work (Trower) with melodies that stand up to the very best Rock ever had to offer, then this is your album.  Enough comparisons to Jimmie Hendrix who was great, yes..but these guys have their own style that today's musicians can only envy.  There are no \\"filler\\" songs on this album. Every one is a gem. Even the slower tunes are a pleasant respite from the hard edge ones, or a nice lead up to the next.  I am a major music fan as many as you are. This is my one favorite album of all them, hands down.  I'm 53 years old, listened to this album when I was a freshman in college when nobody knew who they were in the U.S. it seemed. And here I am, crankin this album in my car with my bald head feelin like a real badass.
0446563048|5.0|\\"Delivering Happiness\\" has become the trade phrase for Zappos.  In this hard-to-put-down book, Tony Hseieh (CEO of Zappos) tells the story of how his life became entangled with the life of Zappos.  Starting with his childhood, Tony tells how he has always had an entrepreneurial spirit: he tried to raise earthworms when he was 9, he held garage sales and sold lemonade, he had a newspaper route (and decided it was just a way for newspapers to avoid child labor laws:), he wrote a newsletter of jokes he tried to sell to friends, he sold Christmas cards, he made custom photo buttons.  Then in high school he discovered computers and began learning.  He got a job testing video games, then became a programmer.  The little jobs continued throughout college, where he tried to find the easiest path through his classwork.  When he graduated college, he took a job at Oracle just because they offered the most money.  And he found a way to do as little work as possible there too.  Because he was bored, Tony and his roommate created LinkExchange which they eventually sold to Microsoft for $265 million.  Bored again, this is where Zappos enters his life.<br /><br />Much of the rest of the book is a fascinating history of how Zappos evolved and grew from nothing to $1 billion in gross sales in less than 10 years.  Along the way, Tony explains how he learned business lessons from a summer fling with playing poker in Vegas.  One of those lessons was to figure out what he really wanted to get out of life.  He dabbled in investing and day-trading but found them unfulfilling.  He dabbled in angel funding (Zappos being one of the companies he funded).  He realized he was passionate about building a company, and the beneficiary of his passion happened to be Zappos.  He poured a lot of his own money into keeping Zappos alive and learned lessons about inventory, warehousing, and outsourcing.<br /><br />About half way through the book is where I started highlighting and folding down page corners.  Tony talks about company culture and how he lead Zappos to invest their time, money and resources into 3 areas: customer services, culture, and employee training.  Tony lists a great \\"Top 10 ways to instill customer services into your company\\" and explains (in great detail) the 10 core values of Zappos culture.  He gives examples of interview questions that they ask to see how the person will fit into the company culture.  He lists some of the course titles that are offered to employees that choose to learn new skills in order to advance their title.  He lists the \\"Top 10 questions to ask when looking for investors and board members.\\"  And then Tony tells the story of how Zappos became a \\"marriage partner\\" to Amazon.<br /><br />The final section of the book is about applying the science of happiness.  This was an outstanding section and the entire book is worth the price just for this section alone.  Tony mentions several books ([[ASIN:B000WCTRW8 The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom]] and [[ASIN:0071492399 Happier: Learn the Secrets to Daily Joy and Lasting Fulfillment]]) that formed the foundation of his research into happiness along with books that taught him about company culture ([[ASIN:0066621003 Good To Great: Why Some Companies Make The Leap...and Others Don't]] and [[ASIN:0061251305 Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization]]).

B001OQCV6K|4.0|3.9 stars<br /><br />I love Holmes in general, from Doyle's finely written stories to the portrayals by Rathbone and Brett, my two favorite screen Sherlocks. While I wouldn't place this Guy Ritchie effort in that league, it comes close and is in any case entertaining and a very fine dose of eye candy; the CGI rendering of 1891 London is excellent, dark and foreboding and almost fog-free! That may be a Holmes first.<br /><br />The highlights are the scenes with Law and Downey together; their interplay is quick and sharp and quite faithful to Doyle, as is the exclusion of the deerstalker cap. Downey lacks the air of deep intelligence that Rathbone and Brett convey so masterfully, but makes up for it with a dry wit and good form in the action scenes. There is indeed plenty of action here, more than perhaps any other Holmes, and it's all typically well-shot by Ritchie, who's sharper than he's been since Snatch. His take on Holmes is fun to watch, and while it's no masterpiece, it's a decent showing, though I must admit to occasional, fond thoughts of The Seven Percent Solution while watching this, as well as the prototypical Holmes, Rathbone, who I'm now going to watch for the nth time in Dressed To Kill before sleep overtakes.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Holmes, Downey, Law, Ritchie, McAdams, or/and action thrillers, you'll probably enjoy this.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|This is there best album yet. Better guitar, better bass, better drums, better vocals. Some songs are more personal then they've done in the past, but it's still a concept album with a good story.  The DVD is awesome, an in-depth look at there writing process with a lot of funny moments. Also they give an explanation of the albums overall story line. Also they explain each individual songs meaning and a bit about making them. Also a lot of photos.   Get Crack The Skye now, because its great, every versions worth the price but those that have the DVD are far better, although I believe there is a new version that includes more music and DVD content pluss cool packaging and even the booklet has more.
1594201749|4.0|The book reaveals the story that made New South Africa.  A brilliant and fluid resume from young Mandela to the great idea of the Rugby World Cup in 1995.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I love this record just like the first one. Every song is a stand out, by my favorites are need u now, our kind of love, hello world and american honey.  some of the the reviews i have seen it magazines have gotten this record wrong.  What would u rather listen to, britney spears?

B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie shows a real (no BS) Christian family - not preaching - but, doing the right thing - which is to love and have compassion.  I will be buying many move copies of this movie and giving them as gifts. Loved it.
0984074422|5.0|This book is one I saw in the library during a Cunard cruise, and just HAD to get for myself.  I also purchased copies for each of my retired neighbor couples to enjoy with their grandchildren.
B002QVOQ0Q|5.0|They are a full blown musical trip. There is a message in their first four albums which includes this on (4), love and life is a feeling, sentiment, mood and sorrow?    Who knows.  These guys got it together. This one is a good start.
B00008CM4J|5.0|This novel is captivating and well written. You'll get caught up in the story. As it relies heavily on the Indian sub-culture in the UK, a knowledge of the history of India benefits the story to no end so I recommend reading books like Salman Rushdie's \\"Midnight's Children\\" beforehand (like I did). The books compliment each other to no end. Also do some research and figure out what's going on in this book (like the history of Thatcher's Children)! It brings the story to life when you understand everything going on.
B0028SVXR6|4.0|Alix review has it pretty close to my own sentiment about Mars Volta's music and Omar's solo projects.     This one is another shining composition by this band    Will be one of my favorites for the rest of my life!      PEACE
B003DEMV1Q|5.0|As with most new albums, you really have to give it time to grow on you. I personally found a lot of these tracks very enjoyable right off the bat, and a couple had to grown on me. There is a really good mixture of club hits and slow jams! Usher is really a pioneer for the R&B genre, so my hat is off to him for coming up with a new flavor, but also catering to that old R&B sound we have grown to love about him. Worth the purchase hands down!
B001OQCV2O|2.0|Watched it last night(3/30/10). If not for some decent CGI and Woody Harrelson's comic character, I would have ejected the disc out and chalked it up to over hype. 2012 had all of the potential to spin a tale about the Mayan prophecies but it failed miserably. Giant Arks in which only the politicians and wealthy survive, Egads! Do yourself a favor and save yourself 20+ bucks.
1423119509|5.0|I bought this boxed set as a gift for my 4th grader, and he loved it.  He has taken a real interest in reading the books (which is not the norm for him), and he thinks the chest of books is very cool.  The box arrived in pristine condition, as did the books.  Overall, I would recommend it as a great gift.
B003DE9W3Q|5.0|I rated this as 5 stars just because I really like \\"It's Just That Way\\" and I really like Alan Jackson's music.  Just note that Amazon will ship the CD to you for $2 less than the download price.  I get that they want to charge more for the convenience of downloading but with respect to \\"green\\" policies, why would there be savings associated with a physical item that has to be delivered vs. direct download?    Seems like it would be a good \\"green\\" initiative to make the physical CD at least equal in price to the download version.  Just my two cents.
0439023491|5.0|Well I purchased this book for my girlfriend, as she was halfway through the first in the series, \\"Hunger Games\\" and was enjoying it. I found the book through amazon, great deal, fast shipping, and waited for her to start reading, and finish reading \\"Catching Fire.\\" So after about a week or so, I got the verdict. Two thumbs up. She said it was better then the first in the trilogy, was exciting from start to end, incorporated some emotions, some attachments; everything a good book should have, it had it, and then some. She's an avid reader of all sorts of books, mostly from the Twilight series, to House of Night, with a couple various genre's in between, but she has good taste. I would definitely recommend this book to any reader looking for something exciting, possibly addicting, with some good twists and turns in between. If you've already purchased both \\"Hunger Games\\", and \\"Catching Fire\\" I recommend waiting on the release of \\"Mocking Jay\\" which I am also doing. Hope this was helpful.
1597770736|1.0|I liked the idea of getting Joy Luck Club on CD and having it read by the author because my tenth grade English students are starting the book. However, \\"abridged\\" means just that: whole paragraphs and pages are left out! There are no warnings or any cues about when the narrator plans to skip ahead.  By the time readers figure out what has happened, they have missed key ideas. My kids were so lost by the time we got to page 23, that we just quit. This recording might be fine for someone driving down the road just listening to get a taste of what the novel is about. It is useless if you want all the nuances of Chinese American culture that are possible with a close reading of the book. lk
1410420442|2.0|I loved Hunger Games, and this was simply more of the same. It's like meeting someone new and thinking they've got a great personality, then seeing them the next day and having the same conversation. I felt like I was reading the same stuff. Hunger Games was so unique and different. No way I'll be reading the third book.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|A new, more complete print has been discovered in Buenos Aires. In 2008, a safety 16mm negative, struck from the deteriorating 35mm nitrate, was made. It was transferred to Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Stiftung which, despite the damaged and compromised nature of the print, undertook a restoration of the original film. It's expected to be released on DVD around the end of 2010. Many questions will be answered on this page:  [...]<br />-- and in an FAQ link from that page. This is quite historical; the edit released in many theatres bordered on incoherency at times, due to large and important bits of the story having been removed. I look forward to seeing Lang's interpretation. My rating is only because one was required; obviously it's premature.
B002VECM6S|2.0|It is a nice story.  A wealthy white woman takes in a poor black kid.  But the family lives in a mansion and never in the movie do they show their black servants.  The house sits on a large, beautifully landscaped lawn.  Where are the less than rich servants who mow the lawn, tend the gardens and shrubbery and keep the place so beautifully manicured?       The movie leaves out the real life of the rich, benevolent family.      In the movie, the father owns 85 fast food restaurants.  They talk about the fast food restauants selling unhealthy fried food but never visit one; probably because the audience would realize the father controls the lives of over four-thousand mostly black employees in Memphis.  Eighty-five fast food restaurants paying minimum wage in Memphis would earn the dad about eight-million dollars a year.  The average employee would earn twenty-five thousand per year.      In the movie the family goes out to dinner often but never to one of their own restaurants. They always go to fancy, up scale eateries where the black employees live in what the mother, played by Sandra Bullock, call the projects.     Now it is nice this very rich family adopted this one poor black boy but what are they doing for the four thousand employees?  And, why does Hollywood hide this side of the story?    In this movie the audience is \\"Blind Sided.\\"    It is a real fantasy movie.  One that should begin, \\"Once Upon a Time.\\"
0691142165|4.0|Reinhart and Rogoff have assembled data, history and theory to conclusively demonstrate that \\"this time is NOT different\\" regarding financial crises.  All financial systems in all times are inherently volatile and unstable.  The combination of too much debt together with overinflated asset prices always leads to a collapse.  Greed, ignorance, risk taking and emotions lead markets to simultaneously encounter asset price bubbles and too much leverage.  The one true constant is the ability of intelligent, historically sensitive, well-meaning individuals to creatively devise compelling explanations for why \\"this time is different\\".    The authors have assembled a massive burden of historical proof.  Their statistical, graphical and textual breadth and depth is impressive.  The work spans eight centuries.  It covers modern, emerging and primitive economies and shares the experience of one hundred countries representing all continents.  Banking, credit, external default, domestic default and inflation crises are analyzed.  The 291 page text is complemented by 216 pages of prefaces and appendices.    The authors also provide patterns, mechanics and theories of the five types of crises, their relation to each other, the role of contagion in spreading damage, ways to detect pending crises, and potentially effective policies and responses.  This analysis rounds out the book, but is not nearly as convincing as the shear weight of the data and episodes in describing the universality of financial crises.      Reinhart and Rogoff also focus on the current \\"second great contraction\\", placing it squarely within the framework of history, describing the warning signals, comparing the impact to other major crises and predicting significant ongoing pain prior to recovery.  The authors seem to have overstated their case, as the current slow recovery lead by emerging market growth is ahead of the comparisons.    This book should be required reading for bankers and policy makers every 10years.
1567315682|4.0|The one thing most worth remembering from this fascinating book is the distinction between income and net worth. Many people may have a high income, but because of high expenses and poor savings patterns, their net worth is low. Conversely, some people are able to build \\"prodigious\\" amounts of wealth (the authors' term) by being careful with their purchases, investing well, and planning ahead. While reading this book, I was able to identify friends of mine in both categories.<br /><br />The advice that the authors give is solid and pragmatic. They tend to be a bit repetitious, and the book could have been at least 50 pages shorter without losing any of its impact.

0805209999|4.0|At times, reading Kafka is comparable to deciphering a Dali painting or viewing an art-house film; that's not to say Kafka's prose is particularly surreal, but rather, slightly detached from reality. There are moments throughout the trial when things border on the peculiar and even the absurd, but unlike, say, The Metamorphosis, he retains some semblance of plausibility here. Reading Kafka is almost like a sensation - much like that one gets well dreaming; although the dream is not reality, for the moments your asleep it SEEMS like reality.<br /><br />What exactly is the meaning of The Trial? Like Kafka's The Castle, the central theme seems to be bureaucracy, but upon closer inspection the real focus is law. What exactly is law? Who enacts it, enforces it, violates it, and who pays for these violations? Can a man break the law unwittingly? I think what Kafka touches on here - and this is just my own personal analysis, as this novel is wide-open to interpretation - are the sometimes almost all-too-apparent hypocrisies  of law, foremost among them, the unquestionable infallibility of law itself. Many of the novels' characters ( perhaps all of them) are inexorably bound by the law - and to the court which enforces it - but not one character, with the exception of the protagonist, challenges or questions the nature of law itself. The more the main character Joseph K. struggles against the law and the charges laid against him, the less progress he makes, and the guiltier he becomes. It is a depressingly oppressive view of people and their place in the moral hierarchy of society.<br /><br />Kafka refuses to pose the question directly: if man is fallible, and man enacted law, does that not make law fallible, or at the very least, flawed? One could argue that Jewish law is considered infallible, because it is the word of god, so Kafka shies away from such a dilemma. However, a simpler and more correct perspective would be that in Kafka's world, there is no hope, no question of escape. The law simply exists, much like how in The Castle, The Castle and it's subordinates exist, more or less as forces of nature, and to struggle against such forces would be an exercise in futility. This is the precursor to an Orwellian Dystopia.<br /><br />That's not to say the novel is completely bleak - it contains bits of black humor, and the beginning is rather optimistic. But in Kafka's world, the man who struggles against the system has lost even before he has begun, and in this particular case, the man spends almost the whole of the tale figuring this out.law simply exists, much like how in The Castle, The Castle and it's subordinates exist, more or less as forces of nature, and to struggle against such forces would be an exercise in futility.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I did this DVD because I started a weight loss pact w/ my best friend. She told me about this 20 minute workout and I figured, what have I got to lose w/ only 20 minutes? It's been almost 2 months since I started this work-out and I'm almost down a full dress size. It's taken me a little bit longer than 30 days because level 2 took me a bit longer to get used to than 10 days and so has level 3. So don't be discouraged if you take longer than 30 days to get through the DVD. My recommendation however, is if you want to do this the right way, you must do it EVERYDAY. I did and I'm so happy to have finally busted out of a 14 and down to a size 12. Everything has toned up beautifully, my arms, my thighs, and most importantly my abdomen. I have my 2-pack back!!! Level 2 I'd say is the toughest for me. Level 3 is no joke either, it's pure cardio but it's also the funnest level of them all in my opinion. Jillian has completely motivated me to push through my weight loss pact and shred down to a size 8. I plan on doing this with her other DVDs, the \\"Banish Fat Boost Metabolism\\" and \\"No More Trouble Zones\\" DVD. With shredding down a size in just 2 months, I'm sure I'll be down to a size 8 by the end of this summer, God willing!

B002VPE1B6|3.0|It is a visually amazing picture with hues and depth in action, some drama with romance and yet it struggles to appeal to the viewers artistic stance with computer graphics and three dimensional effects. What was apparent to me within the first hour of the film was the age-old repetition of the conqueror versus the indigenous. You have all the elements here.<br /><br />You have the mechanically and militarized superior race of men whom disregard the indigenous culture as weak and inferior, even referring to them as \\"indigenous\\" and \\"savages\\";<br /><br />You have the greedy industrialist that hire the military to \\"pave the way\\" for a valuable resource, not unlike oil, natural gas, coal, gold, uranium etc.;<br /><br />You have the sympathetic and culturally driven scientist (anthropologist or religious missionary) that study the \\"natives\\" and see their plight and survival as valuable;<br /><br />and you have the \\"natives\\" that are engulfed in the environment, nature, animals, plants and spiritual existance that naturally gets in the way of \\"man's civilization\\".<br /><br />Take away the SCIFI and the computer graphics and you may have any number of films that deal with the basic issues of greed, militarism, anthropology and indigenous cultures, beginning with American history.<br /><br />The only difference being that in reality, Geronimo does not live happily ever after and the American Indian does not run or regulate the casino, but becomes the janitor instead.
B00064VR0W|5.0|Rod Stewart at the Royal Albert Hall is as good as it gets. This Live performance is  the ultimate concert - show on DVD. I have plenty, including the incredible Leonard Cohen  London Concert. However, Rod Stewart and this performance are better than any  mood enhancing drugs. The show is breathtaking.  I got to know about this DVD from a friend of mine, who is dying of cancer.  When he is 'down' - and that happens frequently now - he puts on 0ne Night Only  and feels better immediately. This way I have watched the show on numerous   occasions and bought the DVD myself to cheer myself up. Thank you Rod - and team -  for a show well done! My friend, from Buchholz in Northern Germany knows about  this review and is in total agreement....

B002V9PEUE|3.0|This is a typical Stallone-vs-bad guy movie, but I bought it in blu-ray for the scenery and the action and I wasn't disappointed. The Rockies in HD are magnificent and the surround sound is excellent, which adds a lot to an otherwise mundane bad guys vs good guys storyline.<br />John Lithgow is a hoot as the head bad guy; he can play comedy and evil geniuses with equal panache and he is up to form here. Stallone is his rugged action-hero self and his performance is typical Stallone. If you love Sly, you'll enjoy this movie.<br />If you love beautiful scenery along with some fun action, you may also enjoy this movie and if you have a blu-ray surround sound home theater system, it should increase your enjoyment of the movie even more.<br />In short, this is not great movie but it's not awful either, so if this type of story is your cup of tea or if you are a Stallone fan, I think you'll enjoy it.<br />While this isn't exactly a 'movie-of-the-year' level film, it's a good trip for those who enjoy action adventure stories and I recommend it for a fun of it.

Kelly would do with the metaphors.<br /><br />Pro Lover  **** 4 stars- love the reggae vibe on the track, Usher gets his mack on.<br /><br />Foolin' Around ***** 5 stars- J.D. gives Usher his Confessions vibe and this is a hit.<br /><br />Papers ***** 5 stars- Once again giving the classic Usher/Confessions vibe, Usher at his most expose moment on the album.<br /><br />So Many Girls ** 2 stars- This is the weakest track. Couldn't get into. Press fast forward.<br /><br />Guilty\\" (featuring T.I.) ***** 5 stars- Wow, a great song. Excellent production. T.I. fits perfectly on this track.<br /><br /> Okay **** 4 stars- A mid-tempo jam. Usher once again laying his mack down on a chick.<br /><br />Making Love (Into The Night) ***** 5 stars- This one has a classic 80's slow jam vibe. This is the baby-making track.<br /><br />Over all this Raymond Vs. Raymond gets 4 Stars. Usher got his swag back on this one. Minus a few missteps this is a superior but not a classic album. I wish he would've worked more with Jermaine Dupri but never the less this was a good album.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|In the genres of action and sci-fi films... this is the very best film that I have seen in my 57 years of life.  It is truly spectacular.  The detail is incredible.  The computer generated material is seamless.  The story is interesting and the action is really excellent.  Even the military stuff is remarkably well done.  The scope, imagination, and spectacle is unequalled in film to date.  I never thought that I would ever say that a film blew away LOTR 3... but Avatar did.<br /><br />Look at the stats.  $2.6 BILLION dollars worth of viewers can't be wrong.  This film doubled the #3 grossing film of all time... LOTR 3.  It has almost equalled the revenue of all three Lord of the Rings films combined!!  And of course it has eclipsed the former #1 film... Titanic... both domestically and internationally and it is still in many theatres!!<br /><br />I don't care if they create a dozen versions of the DVD.  This film is so special that the pain of buying the DVD is soon forgotten when one sits down and watches this amazing motion picture.  The studio is entitled to its profits.  They gave us top quality entertainment.<br /><br />My $.02<br />Bree
0061564893|1.0|This was an easy read - the author is indeed good at his craft. However, it is not factual and yet portrays itself as such. I could have rated this higher if the books admitted that the outlandish ideas presented are speculation. Everything, though, is presented as facts. This is misleading, and has caused many readers to misinterpret wishful theory as historical fact.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I can confirm that the Indianapolis distribution center is shipping the Blu-ray version with theatrical English subtitles.    Nothing more really needs to be said about the film that hasn't been said hundreds of times before. It's a five-star film that will stick with you and you will welcome opportunities for repeat viewings for years to come. Probably as good an adaptation of the Lindqvist masterpiece as anyone could ever hope for (save for a few of the deleted scenes which really should have been left in the film).    Highly recommended for any film lover.
B001P3SA94|5.0|My DVD arrived before I expected it and was as advertised.  Thanks.  AAA+++
B002VPE1B6|2.0|In 2-3 years once the 3-D home technology is perfected (and cheaper)I'll buy the Blu-Ray 3-D edition. For now I'll just rent this so my wife can finally see it.    I already feel burned as now I want to REBUY many DVD titles in Blu-Ray format (some DVDs have only been watched once) and I'm starting to wonder if I should just scrap buying movies and just renting them.     After all, with so many new movies coming out every week, how many times are we really going to watch the same movie over and over again in the next 10 years? For most of us just once or twice yet a lot of us feel we need to OWN it.    Well, at least for me my Blu-Ray price point is $10 a movie or less. If it's not there now it will be soon enough.    In a perfect world we would rent a movie for $1 and use the other $9 to help out somebody with REAL problems...but alas, we are definitely not in a perfect world!
B002M9WW30|4.0|I purchased this item because I'm currently trying to build my blue ray collection and I figured you couldn't go wrong with a box set of rocky movies.  I've always liked the rocky movies and the sale price on this was pretty good for a blue ray set.  I am currently an amazon prime member so the two day shipping on items is awesome.  Love this set but gave 4 stars in the review because my case was scratched when it got here.  I've shipped several things back to amazon before because of this though and didn't ask for a replacement this time.  Just didn't pay attention the day the item arrived and request a replacement.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I think the title of my review says it all.<br /><br />It's hilarious. The script is great. It's like Ocean's Eleven in stop motion.<br /><br />The little touches are great - how they eat (like wild animals), Mrs. Fox's huge paintings actually tiny in human hands, etc. etc. Genius.<br /><br />Slighly gory, the shot-off tail. But otherwise kid-friendly.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Ignore those reviews lamenting that this Blu-ray may not be the Directors Cut.  I've seen both and both deserve 5 stars.  I would, however, wish that Amazon was providing some details of the extras included on the disc.  \\"Tombstone\\" is one of a very few westerns of the past 25 years that belongs on list of Great Westerns.  Everything works amazingly well in this movie from script, cast, sound track and even direction.  I say \\"even direction\\" because the story behind the direction of \\"Tombstone\\" has become legend itself.  Who really was responsible for what is seen remains a mystery.  I like the theory that Kurt Russell was ultimately the man behind the movie but the truth remains elusive.  Without a doubt this is the best work ever done by Val Kilmer and he does steal many scenes in the film.  However, I would also rate this as Kurt Russell's best work and he holds the focus of the story from beginning to end and has many standout moments.  The remainder of the cast is truly remarkable and helps to add great depth to the experience.  All this reflects the original movie and previous DVD's and not the Blu-ray which I don't expect to see until \\"Opening Day.\\"  I'll update this review after seeing the latest version of \\"Tombstone\\" and hope that it will meet my expectations.
B0035V35P8|3.0|Entertaining enough, and very bloody, in the vein of Kill Bill. Lots of hacked heads and limbs. The story is good enough for this sort of outing, and the hero is sympathetic enough. Some great fight choreography.
1597801577|5.0|this book is covered well, i just had to say thanks to mr bacigaliup for a great read. for near dark future fans, this was totally worth it.
1594488843|3.0|\\"Drive\\" starts out very strongly with interesting concepts but becomes repetitive and uninsightful very soon after the first few chapters. Some of the ideas are certainly worthwhile for readers but as a reviewer mentioned, those can easily be obtained from summaries and interviews with the author . The book itself summarizes each of the chapters in the end. The last seventy pages or so contain mostly fluff and almost no substance.     Pink also repeatedly mentions the \\"science\\" of motivation. The repeated use of the word \\"science\\" is deceptive. The material is interesting and certainly worth studying but does not qualify as science. Of course, a book need not be science to be worthy. Economics and psychology need not have science envy but they are worthy in their own right. The book also lacks controlled studies which is ironic given that it boasts to be science. The author has a knowledge advantage which he uses to display data in a way that favors his point. Not enough critical analysis.  Overall, interesting ideas but I recommend reading a summary instead of the whole book. 3 stars because it is not a big time investment and despite its flimsiness adds value.
B001TK8TJO|5.0|When I first picked up this book I thought: \\"What could I possibly learn from this?  Has this guy Chapman really come up with something I don't know?\\"<br /><br />I had two reasons for thinking that way.  1] My wife and I have been married 47 years, we have 4 children and 14 grandchildren, and there is still a lot of love, affection and romance in our relationship.  2] I have taught countless workshops that emphasize the power of love, and authored several dozen audio programs known as \\"The Love Tapes\\" that have sold in the millions.<br /><br />Why didn't I just put the book down and go on my way?  I was curious. I've always been interested in the subject of love and its importance, not only in our personal relationships, but in every aspect of our lives, including health, happiness, and financial success. So I began reading, and, lo and behold, found out that this old dog could learn some new tricks.<br /><br />Gary Chapman is \\"right-on\\" in his analysis of the different languages of love.  I could see where my wife and I, as successful as our marriage has been, were often speaking different love languages.  Had we been aware of the strategies offered in this book, we probably could have avoided some misunderstandings that produced tension and stress that neither one of us enjoyed. Fortunately, we got through these times, but only because of our deep underlying love and sense of commitment to each other.<br /><br />I'm confident that you will see yourself in this book and become aware of some of the simple, but effective steps you can take to enjoy greater harmony, peace, and love in your family.<br /><br />I believe their is something of value in this book for everyone, even for \\"Mr. Love Tapes.\\"
B00004RD54|5.0|Strangely, according to a review I read a while back, the original album did not include credits for the band - Pentti Glen (drums), Prakash John (bass), Ray Colcord (keyboards) and  Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter (guitars).  I say strangely because it was undoubtably a concert made by the collective musicianship of that band.  I've personally never thought of it as classic Lou Reed, so much as a perfect coming together to produce stunning versions of his songs.  Perhaps most comment has usually been regarding Wagner and Hunter, but Prakash John in particular shines and Pentti Glen is more than adequate on drums.    Likewise the intro to Sweet Jane is so riveting as to make that track the most talked about, but I find the gradually intensifying jam in Rock n Roll to be on a par.  If one wanted to be pedantic I guess it could be argued that Heroin is just a tad long, but all things considered there is not really a weakness in the album.    I'm going to make a big call.  I first listened to this sometime shortly after the release of the original, perhaps mid-seventies, and I am even more certain today that this possibly rates as my favourite live rock album ever.  Even if someone was not a real Lou Reed fan, I'd be perplexed if they could not at least appreciate some of the more sublime instrumental passages.  They're simply amongst rock's most spine-tingling ever.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Wow! This is the best vampire series  that i have ever seen. I'm addicted to \\"TRUE BLOOD\\".  I think the writer for this series is really *BRILLIANT*.  All the characters really play their role. The story lines  are *EXCELLENT and UNIQUE* and there's never a dull moment.  I can't wait for season 2 to be released on dvd in May.  Each episode keep you on, the edge of your seat.    This season is definitly a must see and a must buy.  IT'S ADDICTIVE!!!!!!!!!
B0018M6J90|4.0|[[ASIN:B0018M6J90 Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (Widescreen & Full Screen Edition)]] feels like a 1920s cocktail party (although the movie takes place in 1939). The plot follows the chance encounter of Mss. Lafosse, a rich socialite, and Miss. Pettigrew, a governess. As the two spend more time together, their worlds and moral values collide. [[ASIN:B0018M6J90 Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day]] has a lot of energy. The dialogue is very quick and the charleston soundtrack sets a fast tempo. For the first hour, it almost feels like I'm watching an overcaffeinated movie. Nonetheless, [[ASIN:B0018M6J90 Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day]] combines good acting with spunk and is certainly much better than most romantic comedies these days.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I was debating [[ASIN:B000AJIF4E Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone]] vs [[ASIN:B0001FTVDQ Sennheiser HD-555 Audiophile Headphones]] because at the time (November 2009) they were priced within 20-30 dollars of each other. In the end I ended up buying both. I can honestly say I love both for different reasons. I would say the sound quality of the MDR7506 is amazing. While the same is true for the Sennheiser  headphones in the treble range, in the bass range a lot of instrument timbre is somewhat lost. Which is not to say that the level of bass output is low, because the bass can get pretty loud, but the ability to tell what instrument is producing a very bass note is kind of lost. The reason I love the Sennheiser headphones is that they are extremely comfortable! After using the sony headphones for more than a few hours my ears start to get kind of sore, however the Sennheiser headphones remain comfortable after 4+ hours of straight listening. As far as durability go, the sennheiser headphones seem like they can take more abuse than the MDR7506 based on the fact that the MDR7506s have more moving parts and exposed wiring. Because of this fact, I actually ended up later buying a second pair of MDR7506's in case the first break.
B0033AGPEE|5.0|Ordered this on 180g vinyl. Excellent double album set and Jimi never sounded so good. The mastering on these songs have been done exceptionally well. Some versions of these cuts I've never heard before. Highly recommended.
0743201140|3.0|The book itself is great, I would give it 5 stars, but just be aware that you will not get the unique code with a used book.  I didn't know that the code was part of the book, so I didn't even know to be concerned about it.  I ended up having to buy a new book from a local bookstore because I needed the code for a class that I was taking.  If you just want to read the book then it is great, but the code adds a ton to the reading experience
B0017IKR7K|5.0|This is one of my favorite country CDs.  Brad Paisley is one of the best guitar pickers I've ever heard.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Dan Brown should quit while he is ahead.  This book was more of the exact same but less interesting.  It could have ended about 4 times during the conclusion and would have been better off.  Lastly it seemed a little preachy at then end.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Amazing, Beautiful, Colorful, Sleek, Sexy, Intense! A must have for any fan. Need I say more.

B002M9WW30|4.0|The video quality on Rocky I-IV is a bit soft. Probably the best that the studios could do.
B0029PO9L0|5.0|I love this film, which touches on a bit of reality in our society.  A brother, torn by racist propaganda, kills two black crips who tried to jack his car and lands in jail, where he learns things aren't as simple as black white.  But, upon leaving prison and discovering the only reason he left in one piece, he now has to convince his little brother that hating people solely because of skin-color is wrong.  A terrible ending, which I won't tell you about. . . watch the film!
0739377582|2.0|A good read for the first hundred pages or so but goes badly off the rails after Brigitta leaves for China.  I lived in China for four years and none of this part has a trace of reality.  The Chinese plot to offload the masses to Africa is simply ludicrous.  Deeply disappointing after a spirited start.
B002RAREAK|2.0|Three, possibly four good songs.. They are: Daddy's home, There goes my baby, Okay(my favorite..just makes you wanna do very bad things when daddy gets home), and kinda sorta; lil'freak. With singer's like Trey Songz on your heels, Usher shoulda known he had to come better than that. Very dissappointed.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Great family movie but have the tissues ready.  Neat part for me was being there pretty much on set as this film was made, as my office building was right near the train station they used in the film.  Secret is, I even got to pet the dogs used in the movie...they were the real stars!
B00005AWMF|5.0|Sade is the best!  This is a great CD - I also have her new CD, Soldier of Love - I listen to both of these CD's over and over again!  I have to admit - she has become my very favorite female singer!  I think her voice is unique and I would recommend everyone who enjoys this style of music to buy both of these CD's!
B00079FUI6|5.0|After seeing the Desperate Housewives commercials, back in 2005 on the canadian channel Radio-Canada, I was very intrigued by Marc Cherry's show, which was supposed to be claimed very controversial in the United States. And after watching its pilot, I was, for the first time, seeing an incredible and unique dramedy. A universe where Mary Alice Young, a wonderful housewife married to an excellent husband and raising a charming son, kills herself in less than a few hours. And as the season unfolds, we discover the lives of her four best friends, all living in the same street, who try to figure out the mystery of the suicide of their best friend.<br /><br />Now the first thing that really amazed me is how Mary Alice, instead of just being a narrator who tells us what is happening on the screen, is a real character. She comments what she sees and manages to pinpoint to us several things that occur during the episode. not only that, her narration is well integrated in the editing and the story of each episodes. and personnaly, I think her character is one of the main reasons why Desperate Housewives is fun and very exciting to watch.<br /><br />As for the other characters, it was amazing to see how these characters interacted between each other, even though their perosnalities were completely different. While Gabrielle is superficial and vain, Bree is a perfectionist and Lynette is a control-freak. As for Susan, she's a very desperate romantic who almost worships her gorgeous plumber, Mike Delfino. And even though the viewer's ideals can be in conflict with certain characters, the writers manage to give to their characters believable emotions and reactions. And so we get some empathy for all these characters, with the way they interact with their family, and even when they argue or do some horrible things to each other. Once again, it is as if we are witnessing real characters interacting with each other. And witness several incidents that could, or did, happen in our lives, whether at school or on our own street. With excellent guest characters like Maisy Gibbons, whom I would love to see again in the future, Helen Rowlands and Carlos Solis.<br /><br />As for the directing, I just loved the frenzy and the sweet madness that the director of the pilot, Charles McDougall , managed to put. As the music as well by Steve Bartek, for the first two episodes. They were both important reasons as to why people just adored Desperate Housewives and it is sad really theat they couldn't collaborate on more episodes than that. Fortunately , we got Steve Jablonsky for the music and Larry Shaw as a director. Two great additions to the series. Including Danny Elfman's excellent main theme.<br /><br />Thanks to all these ingredients, we finally get a dramedy that stands out of the ordinary for its humour, its incredible and mysterious atmosphere and especially for the incredible, but believable, incidents that can, and sometimes do, happen in suburbia.school or on our own street.

B00111YM5G|1.0|I bought this movie after reading all the rave reviews posted here.  I thought It was AWFUL!  The acting was so bad that I was embarrassed for the actors and wondered how they didnt break out in laughter at each other.  I wish I could have seen in this movie what everyone else saw.  I was so disapointed!  The only actors that werent a laughing stock were andy whitfield and the actress who played Jade-everyone else was pitiful.

0385528752|5.0|I read an awesome book by Chip and Dan Heath called Switch - How To Change Things When Change is Hard. I really enjoyed their previous book Made to Stick.<br /><br />What I like about Chip and Dan's books are that they are founded on real research and have some depth to them. Although I love reading business books, I am finding that many of the books I read are fairly shallow. This one is not shallow.<br /><br />One of the key concepts that the book uses is that of the elephant and the rider. The elephant is that part of you that is automatic and does things without thinking. Although they don't call them this, I would call these habits (or in my case I like to think of them as success habits). The rider is the self discipline which can cause the elephant to do certain things.<br /><br />One concept of the rider is the rider actually does not have an inexhaustible supply of energy so when the rider has to do too many course corrections, the rider simply wears out and the elephant ends up taking over and doing things the way the elephant wants to do them. I think it's an interesting concept to thing in terms that self-discipline as a limited resource and as such we need to figure out how to use it well.<br /><br />The gist of the message is use the rider to develop habits so the elephant has the right habits.<br /><br />I have always said change is opportunity and I have always loved change at one level. However there is clearly a part of me that does not like change<br /><br />The book has many practical examples on how to make a switch (or change). They include :<br /><br />Follow the Bright Spots - Investigate what's working and clone it.<br />Script the Critical Moves - Don't think big picture, think in terms of specific behaviors<br />Point to the Destination - Chang is easier when you known where you're going and why it's worth it.<br />Motivate the Elephant<br />Find the Feeling - Knowing something isn't enough to cause change. Make people feel something.<br />Shrink the Change - Break down the change, until it no longer spooks the Elephant.<br />Grow Your People - Cultivate a sense of identity and instill the growth mindset.<br />Shape the Path<br />Tweak the Environment - When the situation changes, the behavior changes. So change the situation.<br />Build Habits - When behavior is habitual, it's \\"free\\" -it doesn't tax the Rider. Look for ways to encourage habits.<br />Rally The Herd - Behavior is contagious. Help spread.<br />I interviewed Dan Heath:<br />Can you describe any tie ins and differences between Made to Stick and Switch. After Made to Stick - why Switch.<br />When Made to Stick came out, we had the opportunity to work with a lot of people who were trying to make their ideas stick. Most often, they were trying to create some kind of change: a museum director who wanted to inspire other museums to be more accessible to the visually impaired; an entrepreneur who wanted IT directors to adopt his software; a teacher who wanted to change the culture of his private school.<br /><br />So that was our \\"duh\\" moment--the realization that people were using the book's ideas to lobby for change. Made to Stick discusses effective communication, and that's one tool that a leader needs in creating change, but it's not the only one. So we set out to research the question, \\"How can you improve your odds of changing things?\\" And in combing through the psychology literature, we began to find really compelling answers--answers that sometimes surprised us. For instance, psychologists have found that our self-control is exhaustible. It gets fatigued, like a muscle. So one consequence of that is that we shouldn't try to change too many things at once, if we can avoid it. Because when our self-control is exhausted, we'll find change very difficult.<br />In short, we got excited by the research and stories we found, and so we started writing Switch.<br /><br />How did you find working with your brother? Has writing the book made youcloser or not? (I was in business with my 3 brothers for many years so it is a point of curiosity.)<br /><br />It has been a great experience.

The books have given us something to work on together, which is nice. Some brothers fix up muscle cars; we write non-fiction books.

B001W6RRJ8|5.0|Sharon Kay Penman writes like a woman with scores to settle, and after having read her unmistakably brilliant Ricardian novel, THE SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR, I am just about ready to take up a Whyte Boar and Rose-en-Soleil banner myself. So intricately woven, so completely human is this tome that one cannot help but feel as if they have known the characters personally and can vouch for the redeeming qualities of Richard of Gloucester first hand! Penman not only shows a remarkable historical knowledge (if she doesn't already have a PhD, she deserves one) but also an intimate familiarity with the human condition, and every emotion she portrays seems unerringly genuine. The dialogue was at once witty, complex, and realistic. Her every word sparked some sort of emotion in me as I was reading--I hated Elizabeth Woodville as I never had before, rooted for Richard and Bess and Francis with an almost unsettling earnestness, and felt a sense of loss when many of my favorite characters died. Also, an aside: Ms. Penman writes the most riveting battle scenes I've ever read.<br /><br />I cannot praise THE SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR enough; it is so remarkable a feat that I have hardly read any historical novel to equal it, not even those which are my tried and true favorites, and to be honest, this period of history is not my forte so I usually stick to novels which take place in later centuries. Nonetheless, Penman has ignited a new interest in me.<br /><br />Having previously read two novels that dealt with the same events in history, more or less [Daughter of York by Anne Easter Smith and The White Queen by Philippa Gregory], I can say that this easily surpasses them both and if anyone is thinking of reading them, I would strongly recommend reading this first. It is not only just downright enjoyable and possibly addictive, it is very informative. Not that anyone should read historical novels for their factual information--this can get you into trouble with Gregory, for one--but it introduces a wider range of historical figures and scenarios, so that you can at least feel that you have some footing. In fact, I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone, even if you are not the biggest fan of historical fiction. I know a few people who do not exactly share my enthusiasm for reading about people long dead, yet they loved it almost or just as much as I did. Truly a masterpiece. If I could give this more than five stars, I would.e of historical figures and scenarios, so that you can at least feel that you have some footing.

B001OQCV6A|2.0|When I stop a film that has just come out even before the end, and I'm a film fan, it just doesn't work for me.  Downey and Law are brilliant as Holmes and Watson and I sincerely hope the next time they pair up to do one of these it is going to be the pre-quel to this film.  The mystery behind who's committing murder in Victorian London.  Because that is a much more intriguing premise than this rather tiresome piece.  The special effects are grand.  Really good.  But as with so many modern films, special effects are being used in lieu of story or to bolster up a tired script.  With economies melting down in part due to government mismanagement both here and in the U.K., does anyone really care whether or not the Houses of Parliment are done away with?  I mean as a story line?  I don't think so.  And the over used and now very tiresome addition of \\"chemical warfare\\" which we have heard way too much about in the last 8 years in real life and on film comes off like a last minute solution for a quick wrap.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and rent or buy Basil Rathbone's Holmes film \\"The Scarlet Claw\\".  A terrific thriller.  Or Rupert Everett's two films as Holmes.  Or Jeremy Brett's many films and series. But I suggest you pass on this creation and bug the movie company to come out with a pre quel and Downey as Holmes doing some serious and realistic detective work.<br /><br />By the way, the actress who played the villain \\"Irene\\" comes off as about as dangerous as a cream puff.  All the fancy footwork and such does not a villain make.  Irene was scarey because of who she was and how she was to Holmes and the society she lived in.  NOT because she knew judo or whatever.  As for Watson's fiancee role, was that actress playing her even breathing?  What a lackluster performance from an actress I have watched before simply steal scenes in other films.<br /><br />I was hoping for something terrific.  But once again, the old addage, \\"older is better\\" is proven.  Holmes was Holmes before martial arts, inane plots, and special effects.  And his stories were compelling in book form and on the screen because they were GOOD stories.  A very simple idea.  K.I.S.S.  And then some!arts, inane plots, and special effects.

1400082773|4.0|FINALLY got to sit down and read this after sneaking peeks of it at Wal-Mart, on the Internet, etc. In spite of a slow middle section (sorry - I grew up in northern Illinois and the first newspaper I read on a regular basis was the Chicago Tribune, so the inner workings of Chicago politics are not exactly novel to me), I found this to be fascinating reading. I was particularly intrigued by Obama's frank depiction of his teenage years (at the risk of sounding naive, I really didn't expect the f-bomb to be dropped more than once in a book by a sitting president) and his in-depth examination of the lives of his father and paternal grandfather, whose stories have been (unsuprisingly) vastly oversimplfied in the mass media. In conclusion, I think you'll find this to be a insightful and well-written work regardless of which side of the political fence you sit on.

B0036TGSR6|5.0|The Ghost Writer (2010) is the type of movie I love and the film making at its best. Mystery/thriller, in this case a political thriller/suspense, is among my favorite genres and Roman Polanki's film never disappoints. I also think of it as of the masterful Ghost film. The ghosts are everywhere in the film, the ghosts of the past and regrets, including the references to the director's own personal ghosts.<br /><br />All directors who think they know how to set and make a thriller / suspense need to watch the movie made by 76 years old Roman Polanski and learn how to make a highly thrilling exciting movie without special impressive effects or overindulgence with blood, gore, shooting, and sex. The Ghost Writer is magnificent - intelligent, exciting, and dark. Each character is not a two-dimensional cardboard figure, but an interesting personality, each with a ghost in their past. Pierce Brosnan with each new movie shows that he is more than Bond. James Bond. Ewan McGregor did remarkably well in the lead role of the man without a name, a successful \\"ghost writer\\" who has received an enviable contract to make a bestseller of the autobiography of a former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Brosnan). Lang had to resign and now is facing the international tribunal on the charges related to the crimes against the British citizens during the war in Iraq. McGregor's hero with no name snatched the dream contract after the previous \\"ghost writer\\" who had been with Lang for years, tragically and unexpectedly died.<br /><br />I also want to mention Tom Wilkinson in a small role of the distinguished Harvard professor who has known the former PM since their students' days in Oxford. Olivia Williams makes Ruth Land, Adam's wife, such riveting screen presence and her character one of the most interesting among all.<br /><br />The film was made with such assurance, confidence and skill that it never lets the excitement and tension go for a moment. The majority of film takes place on the Martha's Vineyard Island in New England, Massachusetts, during the winter when it rains incessantly, creating oppressive and unforgiving atmosphere of imminent danger. Alfred Hitchcock whom Polanski seemed to pay homage with this film would have been pleased with it. Some scenes are worthy of the cinema textbooks. I only say that I don't recall the expression \\"The Ghost in the machine\\" been so remarkably well and cleverly used as in The Ghost Writer.<br /><br />I highly recommend to watch and re-watch The Ghost Writer because after it is over and you already know who is who and why, the film can be enjoyed as a beautiful piece of filmmaking and you can pay closer attention to the wonderful music, to creative camera work, art direction, production values and everything else that makes a film not just a flick but an event.Island in New England, Massachusetts, during the winter when it rains incessantly, creating oppressive and unforgiving atmosphere of imminent danger.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|bloody unrealistic story of love lost, but so enjoyable to watch! starring the handsome Rupert PenryJones, and beautiful Sally Hawkins - they were cut out for these roles. if Jane Austen adapted to film is your thing, this is the pick. great casting, extreme close-ups, countryside shots, pain and hurt, slimey cousin, Jane Austen speak, an hour and a half of delectable viewing.
B001W63DY6|5.0|What a great DVD and in Blu-Ray.  I was taken in from the very first bars of the Funny Girl overature. The orchastra was terriffic, but first things first. First of all the blu-ray is fantastic, clean, crisp and the sound is great. You see Barbara up front and personal.     Barbara is a wonder. It shows her in a totally different light, relaxed, more human and touchable.  The voice is still there, intact and still a thing of beauty and with total control.  The voice has matured but its nice.  The songs she has sung for years take on an entirely different texture and meaning.  Just like Sinatra, the woman has lived a life and it is there in her music. I must say I loved every minute of it and was surprised that I would. I actually wanted more. Il Divo could have stayed home but it was ok.     I am a fan all over again.  I am searching on Amazon for CDs that I had on vinyl and have not heard in years. If you like Barbara this concert may make you love her, if you already love her, well then you most likely already own this DVD:)
159102594X|5.0|I finished reading The Blade Itself last night. The novel had a lot of hype and acclaim, and so I was expecting great things from it. Fortunately, I was not mislead, and I closed the book with a profound sense of excitement and curiosity.<br /><br />The Blade Itself is the first book of The First Law trilogy. Written by UK author Joe Abercrombie, the book is a realistic, brutal and bloody look at the fantastic. The book starts with Logen Ninefingers fleeing from a group of Flatheads, and I was hooked from the get-go. Logen gets separated from his travelling group and each assumes the other died. He continues on his own. The next character introduced is Inquisitor Sand dan Glokta, a crippled torturer with a dark past. The torture scenes from this book are bloody, but deeply enjoyable. Glokta is charged with getting to the bottom of a conspiracy by any means he sees fit. Enter Bayaz, the First of the Magi. He's a name everyone in the Union knows, but he's a legend, not a real person. Or is he? Finally, Jezal dan Luthar is a Captain in the army, born of high and noble blood, and training for the annual Contest, dreaming of glory and honor.<br /><br />There are more characters in the novel, making fun and entertaining chapters to read and reflect on. Dogman. Ferro. West. Too many to write on, but they all have a roll to play in the plot. By the end of the novel it almost feels like this book is just an introduction or prologue to what is to come.<br /><br />Abercrombie hints at magic, but nothing too deep. He writes of the First Law and the Second Law. He talks about the Shanka and the Eaters, never fully describing them, which is unsettling and immensely entertaining.<br /><br />The writing style reminds me of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. The use of profanity and vulgar words are frequent, but not over-the-top and do not detract from the story. Keeping the \\"magic\\" as a mystery is also like GRRM.<br /><br />My favorite character is probably Glokta, but I'm equally intrigued by Logen. I can't wait to see where this story is going, especially for these two. Hopefully I'll get my copy of Before They Are Hanged soon. Overall, The Blade Itself is another reminder why the fantasy genre does not have to be boring and cliche. People like Joe Abercrombie, Pat Rothfuss, and Brandon Sanderson are breaking boundaries and re-defining the field. I can recommend this book easily to you, but be warned, it's brutal and will hook you in, kind of like the way a torturer's blade may pull your intestines out and have you screaming for more.can't wait to see where this story is going, especially for these two.

B002GYVRRI|2.0|So...how weird is this? Played great in my acura tl which supports dvd-audio. however, on a sony player through my adcom preamp that supports dts, there were constant drop outs. even weirder, on my dvd-audio cd player, what resulted was a truncated trio version. for instance, starless, all that came through was the rhythm sections, voice and soprano sax. interesting. toward the end, more instruments came in. sounded interesting, actually. yet, had they included a dolby digital option, i could have boomed it downstairs with no problems, running through mcintosh gear. oh well, the price of being fancy and snobby...

0375826726|3.0|I cannot tell you how happy I am to be done with Brisingr. For those of you that don't know, this book is the third book in the Inheritance Cycle, which begins with Eragon and Eldest. These books are written by Christopher Paolini, and these are his first major works. I read Eragon years ago when it first came out. I was a younger lad then with a different outlook on books, particularly the fantasy genre. Needless to say, I enjoyed the first book, and I was immensely satisfied with the sequel, too. Brisingr was to be the conclusion of the series, but the story grew too large and Paolini needed to add a fourth book to tell his tale, which, at the time, was fine by me. If you haven't read these books, particularly Brisingr, then be warned that there may be plot revealing statements below.<br /><br />*****LOOKOUT FOR SPOILERS! THEY'RE LURKING BELOW*****<br /><br />This book starts on the heels of Eldest. Eragon is learning to live with his family problems--Morzan, Murtagh--and also grappling with his role as Alagaesia's savior. In this book, Eragon and Roran must save Katrina from the vile Ra'zac, Eragon must travel to Farthen Dur to secure the Dwarve's position with the Varden, he must travel back to Ellesmera to learn more from Oromis & Glaedr, he must find a true Rider's sword. The novel also focuses on Roran Stronghammer, Eragon's cousin and friend, and his travels with the Varden.<br /><br />There are points in the story that I really enjoyed. For example, I love the close relationship Eragon and Saphira share, and it makes me wish I could have that sort of close contact with someone or something. I liked the mini quest of searching for a Rider's sword, particularly under the Menoa tree. I like the nuances of the languages spoken in the land, but sometimes I feel they're a bit ridiculous.<br /><br />A couple years ago I thought the Ancient Language mechanics to invoke magic was unique, but now I think it is a very complicated, complex, and messy system.<br /><br />Honestly, the only reason I read this book was because I was (and still am) a little interested as to how Galbatorix will die and his reign end. He will most definitely die, of that I have no doubts. The story is too \\"young adult\\" and light for there to be a plot-twist where Galbatorix wins. I also hold the belief of starting a book means finishing a book, and in this case, starting a series means finishing a series.<br /><br />*****END OF SPOILERS*****<br /><br />Overall, I give Brisingr a 2.5/5.0, or a 50% positive review. The story did not have enough Realism for my liking. After reading Pat Rothfuss' brilliant work, The Name of the Wind, and George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire books, I enjoy the realistic approach to fantasy as opposed to the cliche fantasy. Don't misunderstand the previous statement: I enjoy some of the atypical books in the fantasy realm, but others are too akin to each other for my liking. I appreciate uniqueness and creativity, which Brisingr employs, but not enough for my satisfaction.ook was because I was (and still am) a little interested as to how Galbatorix will die and his reign end.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|This was definitely an updated 'look' for Sherlock Holmes. Robert Downey plays him as a slovenly but brilliant character as opposed to the tidy, aristocratic version made popular by Jeremy Brett. He stays true to the important elements of Holmes' character; socially awkward, substance abuse, unbalanced when not engaged in a case, etc. I enjoyed Jude Law's more vital and energetic interpretation of Watson - more of a true partner than just a sidekick. I also liked the menacing introduction of Professor Moriarty - a clear staging for a sequel if Ive ever seen one. Overall I think Guy Ritchie did a great job creating a more athletic, human, and fun version of Holmes than we're accustomed to while retaining the elements that make the character great.
B00394DOE8|4.0|This book is sad, but it teaches a lot. Once I started reading it, I could not put it down. I do  not want to ruin the story and I hope this does not spoil it. I will try my best not to, but if you are afraid of hearing more, then you might not want to read from here. This book is about two woman from different generations who are married to the same abusive man. It gets into the lives of both of these woman prior to marrying. This book gets into the poverty of Afganistan; I feel bad for the people who live there who are suffering from starvation and poverty, but this book really educates people around the world and makes them aware of what is going on. I like how he uses the language in the book and I loved learning new words. It was interesting to read about the culture.
B001U0HBPG|4.0|The film has a lot going for it. For one, most of it takes place in Old New Orleans (my home town for awhile) and you can't go wrong--provided you capture the flavor (which I feel the movie did). It has 3 fantastically popular & attractive \\"stars\\" (and I must confess I haven't seen much of their work, particularly Brad Pitt's.) It has a great overall cast too. The African-American actors were particularly effective I thought. And, of course, it has a very mysterious & unlikely storyline.<br /><br />On the debit side, the movie was too long for what it had to offer (or failed to suggest in the script). I think 15 mins. could have been deleted--and my aim would be the whole scenario about modern dance. Not cut completely, but cut nonetheless.<br /><br />It was sort of funny that Tilda Swinton should be in this age-generation-bending little epic, considering her own role in ORLANDO where she not only age-bent, but gender-bent as well. I like her, but was not particularly keen about her Moscow scenes. There was just something superficial about them--not her--them.<br /><br />So far I have not seen a Brad Pitt film where I could say, Wow, he's a really good actor; but as I said, I've only seen a few movies he was in, but not really \\"starred\\" in. This film didn't help because so much of his character depended upon technicalities (make-up, special effects, etc.) over technique (as in acting). As to his physical beauty, that was really only featured in a short scene with Cate Blanchett (my own reigning diva at the moment.) Sorry, girls...you're in luck, though, if you like tiny little old men.<br /><br />I found the production interesting enough to see it twice in a row. I was mesmerized by the early scenes--and LOVED the big scene at the revival meeting. The little Benjamin was really, really cute & great to watch. These were the best scenes I felt. They caught the (inter-racial) mood of turn-of-the-century New Orleans. I noticed another reviewer had a problem with how the father was portrayed in the movie rather than in the book. A major reason to have read it first because there was something that just didn't click or ring true about it for me either.<br /><br />Finally, what I will remember most about the film is the music--it was wonderful, perfect. Sometimes you could barely hear it, then at the appropriate spot it would amplify ever so gently--like a music box or from an old time circus. It was one of the best movie scores I've heard lately. Whimsical, mystical, magical to compliment the theme.<br /><br />Despite the lack of the 5 Star rating, I know I'll watch the movie again...maybe even tonight (it's a rainy, stormy night--lightening & all, perfect night for a sweet fantasy.)<br /><br />'night, y'all!ie rather than in the book.

0756984408|5.0|The Book Thief is a powerful book. It's a book that I would call beautiful and epic and unique. With personified Death as the narrator, the story is told from a unique perspective that's strangely akin to a human's.<br /><br />It's hard to describe how wonderful this story is. While it's set in Hitler's reign of Nazi Germany, the story is filled with humor and life. Many times I found myself laughing out loud at something that was said or done. The protagonist, a young orphan girl named Liesel, learns to live with her new foster parents, to make friends in Munich, to follow the Nazi propaganda, to learn how to get on with life during the oppressiveness of war. Her life's story is amazing and inspiring.<br /><br />Death's perspective describes many things in colors and sounds, and the adjectives throughout this book are as close to realism as possible. It was as if I could reach out and touch what Death was describing. And since Death talks about his life during World War II, the descriptions are surreal and ghastly.<br /><br />Liesel soon discovers that stealing makes her feel alive, that taking things is her way to stay apart. She turns to stealing books, and the book thief is born.<br /><br />I liked how Death eased the burden of his tale throughout the story, by foreshadowing what was to come. This caused the novel to be tinged with tragedy everywhere, but it was not overwhelming. And even though I knew the direction the story was headed, I couldn't help but feel sad by the end of the novel. Actually, it made me feel like I should cry, but I couldn't bring myself to.<br /><br />My favorite thing in the book was the relationships Liesel had with Rudy and Hans. Rudy was her best friend, and the two had a great friendship. Hans was her foster Father, and their love for one another was obvious.<br /><br />There were many scenes from the book that were memorable, but I hesitate to write on them to remain spoiler free. Suffice it to say that the book was unforgettable.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like in the book was that it was marketed as a Young Adult book, targeted for teens. The author, Markus Zusak, did not write the book with a YA audience in mind, but this was decided by the publishers to market it this way (presumably because the protagonist was an adolescent/teen girl.) So if you abstain from YA books, don't let the tag scare you away, it definitely works as an adult novel.<br /><br />All in all, The Book Thief was a superb novel. Its realism is phenomenal, its story is brilliant, and its characters are believable. I'm likely to remember this story for a long time, and it's one that I can see myself going back and reading again, enjoying it a second time around.<br /><br />Two of my favorite quotes from the book:<br />\\"You see, even Death has a heart.\\"<br />\\"'Don't get caught.'

But there is one animated film that will be in my heart forever: Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas.

That's where he discovers Christmas Town. He decides to let Santa \\"take it easy\\" and take over Christmas.

B0031Y4AQC|5.0|This record was the first Doors album I ever recorded to tape, so that I could carry it around and listen to it. It carved a very deep, lasting groove into my consciousness. Sure it has flaws and a few \\"what were they thinking ?\\" moments, but when you take this record in its vinyl configuration and listen to it from beginning to end, it gives you a great idea of what alive Doors' show was like. But it brings much more than that. To me, it reveals an echo of the rapidly decaying \\"Woodstock\\" ethos. Things were getting dark and a little creepy both in America and among The Doors themselves. The gloss of their impeccably produced studio records is nowhere to be found. A dangerously unfettered Jim Morrison was doing weird-assed things on stage and you never knew if the deferential and polite Morrison, or his Id-driven alter ego Jimbo was going to take the mike. That this is now back on the Billboard charts, simply on the basis of a new vinyl edition, with no corresponding CD version, shows what that experience means to much younger audiences than we baby-boomers.     In 2010, rock music is forced, tired and as stiff as Scott Stapp's singing voice. Each new record release is orchestrated by record company buffoons to get attention from a yawning audience. There is nothing for the theatre of the mind, much less the soul, in most new bands. This rough shod piece of Doors' live shows from 1970, released while Morrison was still with us, gives some like me a fond look back to a time when rock mattered, when it spat where it ate, and where poetic license had some legitimate meaning, because rock was being played by real poets. That's all I need to know to buy this, yet again, on vinyl.For younger listeners, it gives a view of a record as a subversive act, and shows how to make great music that doesn't rely much on technology to get it's point across.    And the point of \\"Absolutely Live\\" ? I have no idea. I just know that it made that point with a frightening, primal \\"WAKE UP! \\", not 120 Db of overproduced guitars.     Uh, can we get the original cover and a spiffy new remaster job on CD anytime soon ? Just wondering.
B000HT2P9S|4.0|I've just finished reading Neil Gaiman's American Gods. The book leaves me thinking many things.<br /><br />1. I'm really not sure whether or not I fully understood the book. Some things were explained, others were left up to the imagination. This is fine by me. But what did I glean from the novel? What was the theme? From what I gather, gods need people to believe in them, or they cease to exist. More important is the life of America. Does America change so much, growing in culture and mythos, that it forgets long-forgotten beings?<br /><br />2. I really liked the style of writing. I felt like I was thrown into a meta-stream-of-conscience/third-person novel. Sure, I was lost on occasion, but I was always intrigued.<br /><br />3. The fact that I did not, do not, completely understand the book gives me mixed feelings. The concept of magic and mystique was vague, but implied, while grounded in the real world. I felt that this could be explained better or more fully, but Gaiman knows what he's doing.<br /><br />4. The allusions: there were many, many allusions and references to pop culture and past culture. Several sites, towns, etc really exist here in America, making the novel fun. Also, I felt like many themes and ideas were connected to the Sandman comics, which I've posted on here. Too many to mention, in fact.<br /><br />5. Mythology: I am a big fan of mythology and folklore. If I ever decided to continue my education, I think I would want to take classes in folklore, fairy tales, myths, and the like. With that, American Gods has extensive characters from many cultures and religions and beliefs from all over the world. I didn't know who some of the characters were supposed to be, but I liked them.<br /><br />6. Denouement: The conclusion of the story was acceptable. There seemed to be one main plot, the fate of the gods, and a few subplots (Laura, Lakeside, identity), and all were resolved satisfactorily. Though, it did sadden me a bit that Shadow met Easter, while Laura did not.<br /><br />7. Laura: This was the most confusing character in the book. Laura is Shadow's recently deceased wife. Why does she come back from the dead? How? There were many questions about Laura, but her character was important for the development of Shadow.<br /><br />There you have it. Some meager reflections on Gaiman's novel.

I realize some people have a hard time accepting Jake imprinting on Nessie, but I didn't find it disgusting because it is not sexual.

0307266303|5.0|This is an amazing, amazing read. I love how the story is told. It keeps it interesting. The thing I love most about this book is it reminds you of why running is so great. Strip away the races, the pressure, the companies trying to sell crap to you... and you get down to what running is really about. It makes you want to go out and run like the Tarahumara, and even more so, try an ultra!
B00336C3EY|1.0|I rented this one not knowing anything about it.  I like to be surprised by a movie.  I did see the description as a dark comedy, so I'm thinking \\"Great!  A new movie from the Big Lebowski brothers.\\"  An hour into this I was thinking I haven't laughed once, so all of this character development is building up to something fantastic.  I could not have been more horribly incorrect.  Worst ending of any movie I have ever seen.  As the credits rolled I was audibly shouting WTF?  That's it!?!? to my TV.
B00006FDCD|4.0|To start, It was a made for TV production. So lots of the elements from the book were toned down if not removed. That's expected so otherwise well done.<br />Little to medium things are changed and edited to speed the pacing, again expected considering the length of the book. A few large story items are changed, such as the henry bowers character is much less filled out in the movie.<br />The child actors seem to be a little rough at performing in the beginning but they get much better as it continues. My opinion about the adults is the same. Both of these complaints mainly come the character Bill, stutters being difficult to portray convincingly.<br />All together I enjoy the book and do enjoy this movie. Fun to watch them come together as kids and make tougher journey of reconnecting again as they're older.<br /><br />This DVD is a double sided disc and flipping it half way through is necessary. It's not so bad since being a two part miniseries there is an obvious break point.
B00337KM2S|5.0|According to the tagline of the film, \\"Up in the Air\\" is about \\"The story of a man ready to make a connection.\\" The irony is that Ryan Bingham, our protagonist, is a corporate downsizer, a man traveling across the country to fire employees. He is hired by their employers who would rather not see them in person. He spends his days traveling around the country to meet people he knows he will never see again.    \\"Up in the Air\\" is a comedy drama, but its subject matter is immediate and very serious. Another irony of the film is that Ryan Bingham, the corporate downsizer ready to make a connection, is played by George Clooney, one of Hollywood's most likable stars. In fact Ryan, always efficient and professional, is able to charm his way through life. Ryan is so confident, and perhaps he should be, though we are aware that behind the amusing (and satirical) sketches of him there is something missing in his life.     Things get more complicated for him when Ryan meets two women: Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga), an enigmatic frequent flyer Ryan sleeps with, and Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), his ambitious coworker selling her own idea to Ryan's boss Craig (Jason Bateman): firing people through the Internet and video camera. Obviously Ryan's life is about to change, but can he really connect to other people? Or what does he want in his life?    Having seen \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" and \\"Juno,\\" I think Jason Reitman is one of the most talented directors of his generation. He turns controversial issues into drama with humor and thought-provoking challenges for viewers. He knows the right way to do it. You may not like what his characters are doing - and they often do it with confidence - but you definitely care them, or are at least interested in them and their life.    Not everything is perfect, I admit. Though her acting is fine, Anna Kendrick's character (her back story about the boyfriend, for instance) doesn't really convince. The story is told with good pace, but some part ofit is a bit familiar, and charming Melanie Lynskey is sadly underused. Still \\"Up in the Air\\" is an intelligent comedy drama with one serious theme, bolstered by superb acting from the three leads, George Clooney, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick.
B002RSDW80|3.0|This movie features an incredible performance from Meryl Streep.  The Julia half of the film is interesting for that reason alone.  The Julie half of the equation didn't work for me at all.  She's self-centered, obsessive-compulsive, manipulative and somewhat of a whiner.  There really was no connection between Julie and Julia except in the fantasy world of Julie.  Towards the end of the movie we find out that Julia hates Julie, no doubt because Julie is exploiting her contrived psychic bond w/ Julia for fame and financial benefit.  Check out the movie for Streep.  That's all...
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was hooked on this book from the start. It is amazing how the author has such a realistic point of view of the military and our lifestyle. I also took some pointers from the story when the real outbreak occurs. Great book very well written the author treats us with just enough of a glimpse into each character to understand their emotions during their plight. I recommend this to Anyone who is a Zach fanatic lol :) Thank you for a great read.
0753801728|5.0|This is an excellent and thought-provoking book that made me consider new perspectives on the holocaust.    Although there is more than one theme here, I think the most striking is the one in which Bernhard Schlink uses the relationship between a 15-year old boy and a 30-something year old woman to address the strange ambivalence of attraction and revulsion that the German generation born after the holocaust felt toward its parents and older generations for their involvement in the holocaust.    Through the eyes of the 15-year old boy who grows up during the course of the novel, we come to see how difficult it was for the generation born after the holocaust to simply mark its elders as \\"evil\\" or corrupt. While the children of that generation wanted to hold those who were involved in (or who allowed to take place) the holocaust as criminals, it would have been impossible for those children to escape the fact that those criminals were their mothers and fathers, or their kind neighbors.     By the end of The Reader, no matter how much the narrator thinks he has broken away from the influence of his former lover, he finds that the memory of her haunts him in every area of his life - just as the German psyche would have been completely inescapable to any young Germans wanting to break away from their identification with Germany and the horrors that the country and its people committed during WWII.
B00008I8IF|5.0|I understand the Jayhawks were in fact from Minnesota, not Kansas, but it is of little import. This was a quintessentially heartland band, as midwestern as cornfields. Honest, unvarnished. I know it is generally regarded that the Jayhawks were at their best when Louris & Olson were together, but this disk is at least as good as Hollywood Town Hall or Green Grass. Highlights include Will I see you in Heaven, Tailspin ... but its really not about highlights. The totality is greater than the sum of the parts. It hangs together well, as an album. The bonus disk is nice, but this is a great record, with or without it (though the acoustic version of waiting for the sun is particularly nice.
B00328G4XY|1.0|First off, \\"Electic ladyland\\" was remastered for a 3rd time in 1997 and by the Estate of Jimi Hendrix, the brought in no other than the iconic Eddie Kramer (who was the original engineer and produced much of Jimi's original recordings)plus they said on the 1997 remasters to have used the original mix-down tracks, I mean why 13 years later do we all a sudden need a new re-master? Jimi has been \\"remastered\\" now so many times its a joke! The catalog first came out on CD in 1990 on reprise records and they sounded like shiet! Then they were very quickly re-mastered, actually within just months of their intitial release, they were deemed so horrible that they were quickly remastered and resold with just a small sticker on the box (they had CD's in long narrow boxes then) the sticker just said \\"remaster\\". This wasnt a true remaster but a quicky job using some system called \\"sonic solutions\\", a way to remove static and such from the songs, but thats about it, but still big improvment. Also to be noted, Electric ladyland was originally released as a 2 CD set, the remaster changes it to 1 CD.  Then in 1993 when Alan Douglas moved to the MCA label, they were agian re-mastered and given new CD covers (dumb idea) they all looked liked the \\"Voodoo Soup\\" ill fated CD cover. Those were true remasters and said to use the original mater tapes. Then in 1997 Al and Janie Hendrix wins there lawsuit over Alan Douglass and all the CD's were once again remastered, just 2 stupid years later! The gimmick this time was they went back to the original mix down tracks and remastered from those plus as well as brought back the original artwork. Then now they move to sony/legacy and what do they do.....???  REMASTER the songs......get real!<br />Then after all that is said....<br />++ PLUS I can say this: VOODOO CHILD (Slight return) is STILL NOT remastered correctly!<br />I have this on the original Reprise records vinyl. Voodoo Child starts out with a \\"hum\\" or \\"buzz\\" in the background, prob from Jimi's amp and it starts out in the left speaker and comes into both speakers within 4 seconds, the buzz tho is heard until the song kicks in after the intro.<br />The song does NOT fade at all but sounds more like the tape running out. Now this song even had 1 more remaster (if you can believe that!) In 1985 reprise released \\"Kiss the Sky\\" a greatest hits and was the very first album to have remastered Jimi songs on it and I first noticed this botch back then, infact the song fades out early and is a few seconds shorter than the original mix put out in 1968. Let me hear it the way Jimi approved it in 1968 with all it's inperfections.<br />Im just sick of record companies making a huge splash over remastering, you listen to this and listen to the 1997 remaster......the diff is well......you cant tell. many have said these are the same 1997 remasters bogusily being resold as new, whereas some say they are new....whatever the case, its not justifying buying the new cd.....or with the crumy DVD promo film you get with it. Why didnt they throw in the 70 min DVD of the making of Electric ladyland?  Na, they want you to buy that as well.p and it starts out in the left speaker and comes into both speakers within 4 seconds, the buzz tho is heard until the song kicks in after the intro.

B002RAREAK|2.0|The only Usher album I've ever listened to other then this was his most popular one, 'Confessions', which I liked a lot so I decided to check out his new one. That was a bad mistake..... This has some good songs on it, but not many.... The only songs that sounded good to me where-    Monstar: I loved this joint, it sounds like something MJ would make  Hey Daddy: The best song on the album   Foolin Around: This reminds me of the songs on \\"Confessions\\" so I loved it  Guilty: I didn't \\"get\\" this one at first, but the chorus grew on me     The rest of this album is very mediocre....If I had to say anything good it would probably be that I KIND OF liked the production on 'Lil Freak'. The rest of the album however is a mixture of annoying pop, synth beats and boring ballad songs with no cool melodies or hooks.    Iumak gives this one a 3/10    (Note to Amazon: Are you manipulating the helpful points? 10 out of 18 found this review to be helpful before.... Why does it say 4 out of 12 now?)

0385523904|5.0|I took one day out of my paternity leave for pleasure reading. I selected a new Kindle book I bought after hearing the author interviewed on NPR: Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea. It was utterly fascinating. I devoured it.<br /><br />Demick weaves a gripping narrative which puts the reader in contact with daily life north of the DMZ. And the story is more than just exciting and interesting: the relationship between Mi-ran and Jun-Sang (not their real names) has to be one of the most romantic stories I've ever read.<br /><br />Demick focuses on people from the area around the North Korean city of Chong-Jin. She can tell such intimate stories about citizens of a closed country under an oppressive regime because she spoke to them personally. They all defected (or, in one case, were tricked into defecting and only then defected!) to South Korea where Demick, the L.A. Times Korea correspondent, was able to interview them.<br /><br />Not all of the defectors were born dissidents. Several were classic true believers in the regime who only reluctantly gave up their religious faith in the \\"Fatherly Leader.\\" Once inside South Korea, most of them expressed some desire (sometimes) to go back northward.<br /><br />Reading this work gave me a deep sense of righteous anger at Kim Il-Sung and his son Kim Jong-Il. I had already viewed the latter as a ridiculous man: he wears silly jumpsuits and is always followed by fawning military officials in massive caps. Now I view him as culpable for the deaths of millions. Ideas have consequences, and when your economic policies kill your own citizens you need to take responsibility and change the policies. Instead, the North Korean propaganda machine went into overdrive: \\"Let's all eat two meals a day!\\"<br /><br />Kim Jong-Il appears to believe his own propaganda. If everyone around you agrees with everything you say and proclaims you an expert on everything from industrial glass production to the best bovine fertility practices, perhaps it's inevitable that your pedestal's height starts to put you out of touch with the people on the ground.<br /><br />As I read I was filled with a desire to do something for these people--and then I started to realize what that might mean. South Koreans certainly have realized it, according to the book. Rehabilitating an entire half-nation and bringing them up to the high-tech standards of the other half would be costly and difficult. Add to this the fact that a lifetime of conditioning has influenced the thinking of everyone. Even defectors have a hard time making it in the South. They have to go through a special government deprogramming.<br /><br />But nonetheless I have prayed that the true King of this world would depose the leader He, for His own purposes, set up decades ago (Psalm 75:7; Romans 13:1). Kim Jong-Il deserves to answer for his crimes, primarily that of defacing the image of God by putting such little stock in the lives of God's image-bearers.<br /><br />Buy this book for an education on the politics and history of North Korea, and read and enjoy this book for the many personal stories that you can follow from their beginnings under oppression to their breakthrough to (political, at least) freedom.estal's height starts to put you out of touch with the people on the ground.

B003162R7E|5.0|*First the Album is awesome, a true 10! This review is on the cheap advertising attempt to get the general public to buy a new CD. This album first came out in 1997, it was REMASTERED using EDDIE KRAMER and working with the Original mix down tracks (one step deeper than just using the Orignal Master tracks, but going one step beyond those and getting the original mix down tracks. I don't think technology has advaced to such a degree that warrants a brand new rematering. You wont notice any difference. You will get a small mini-documentary DVD, but is it worth the price of buying this all over again? NO. If you dont own this CD, then certainly buy this edition.<br />THE ALBUM REVIEW............This was supposed to be the next studio album after Electric Ladyland. Jimi worked on this project for 2 years, recording, remixing, over dubbing, recording again, you name it! He at a few times wanted his next album to be a 3 album set. He died before this album was finished, infact Drummer Mitch Mitchell came back in the studio and layed down some final over-dubs for a few songs (\\"Angel\\" for one) and also co-produced the final product. Buzzy Linhart was brought in the record vibes and \\"Drifting\\" after Jimi's death. The album was originally released in Jan 1971 in a shortened 1 album set called \\"The Cry of Love\\" where it reached #7 on the Billboard top 200 album charts and \\"Freedom\\" was released as a single but failed to chart. It became out of print in 1995 when then owner of Hendrix estate (Alan Douglas) released the re-packaged CD as \\"Voodoo Soup\\" in which he HEAVILY RE-MIXED the songs (which angered many of Jimi's fans). The songs selections were different. In 1996 when Al Hendrix (Jimi's father) won a lawsuit and once again re-claimed all of his sons estate, \\"Voodoo Soup\\" was immedialty deleted from the catalog and released a later as \\"First Rays of the New Rising Sun\\" This album captures more of the true aspect of what was to be Jimi's next studio album, tho a few songs made it on this CD that wouild Not have been included (My Friend fro one) and a few songs were left off that surely would have made it (Poly Gap, Saving My Love for Linda, Valleys of Neptune). But what you have here is a amazing collection of songs that shows much deeper arrangement texture and pain stakingly percise overdubs that make up the most personal and complex album ever by Jimi Hendrix. Whats gone are the flashy show-man style songs like \\"Foxey Lady\\" but songs written on social commentary (\\"Straight Ahead\\") songs also of peace and understanding (Hey Baby, new rising sun). Had this album been released in Jimi's lifetime, it would have garnered the attention of many and would have put him in the realms of John Lennon, songs of SUBSTANCE. It is therefore sadly Jimi's least popular album because it's not a acid rock and roll album complied of songs about partying, women and having fun. Listen with your mind and see the vision Jimi was heading. I can fully understand why he took 2 years on this album and it still wasnt finished, it would had changed the entire perception of this man and headed Jimi into a completely new direction of music.<br /><br />Quick Note on the REMASTERS:<br /><br />Jimi has been \\"remastered\\" now so many times its a joke! The catalog first came out on CD in 1990 on reprise records and they sounded like shiet! Then they were very quickly re-mastered in 1991 using some system called \\"sonic solutions\\" not a true remaster but just a way to remove static and such.

B001RIY4WE|5.0|This Skynet realease is SO MUCH BETTER than the first bu-ray version. The PQ and AQ blows you away. This is how blu-rays should look and sound! Buy this one!  Make sure you don't buy the earlier version. I got rid of my earlier blu-ray version. The Skynet release has DTS-MA 6.1 Audio. The Skynet release does start up a little longer (mine takes about four minutes) but the wait is worth it. - this is the one to buy.

If you really want to know how this conflict started,was fought and finished from all points on earth this is the ONLY collection that will teach and make you understand how this horrific conflict started,was fought and completed and still effects all of civilization to this day. There is no better way to learn about WWII.

B001IDHK88|5.0|Very bizzar story. If you liked \\"The Blair Witch\\" or \\"The Ring\\" you should love this. It's three stories running at the same time tied into each other. I doubt it will ever see the silver screan. I liked it so much I'm ordering a copy to replace my original that I can't find. Signed too. You might not want to read this at night when your all alone.

I love the historical information you learn from these books about middle ages Europe. The characters are very richly developed in these stories. You find yourself despising some characters & rooting for others. Follett gives us several heroes & villains to keep up with. The main characters are decedents of the characters from Pillars. Most of the story takes place in Kingsbridge again. A lot of the general themes are similar to Pillars, but there are new characters & story lines. I found myself wanting more even after 1000 pages!
B000003TAW|5.0|If you haven't heard of Weezer before, this is a good CD to start with.  While they're not the most popular band out there, they have a decent following and they aren't exactly unknown either.  The songs are I guess considered punk, but they're more like the pop or rock you'd hear on an average radio station.  I've seen them in concert twice putting on a realy great show.  Their songs have a good beat and/or are funny or amusing.  It's one band my wife and I can agree on when we're driving in the car.  They're really talented and I fully enjoyed this purchase.  If you like this one too, be sure to check out their Green and Pink albums.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|If there ever was a television series that could capture the heart of many, and be watched over and over again, Gilmore Girls would be that series. I, like many others, have fell in love with this quirky series and have watched all of the episodes countless times. Gilmore Girls is a magnificent seven season television series that ran from 2001 through 2007. This whimsical dramedy plays on the storyline of a mother and daughter who are closer than most and only separated by sixteen years. After hearing that the basic plot line of Gilmore Girls is about the relationship between a mother and daughter, many may find it hard to understand how this series can be all it is cracked up to be. However, after giving this humorous, and often sarcastic, television series a try, many will wonder why it took them so long to pick up the remote.    In its most basic form, Gilmore Girls is the story of the unusually close relationship between a single mother, Lorelai Gilmore, and her daughter, Rory.  Lorelai and Rory live in the small eccentric town of Stars Hollow, where life is never dull and everyone knows everyone's business.  Lorelai became pregnant with Rory at sixteen and ran away from her parent's lavish life to become her own independent person in Stars Hollow. The series starts when Rory is fifteen and progresses until her college graduation at the age of twenty two. Throughout this series, viewers see family feuds, dating mishaps, struggles of school and single parenthood, all wrapped in a nice little package, jam packed with so many popular culture references it is hard to keep up.  Gilmore Girls is one of the fastest talking, wittiest and most vibrant television series available.    Owning the complete series is something that any Gilmore Girls fan needs to acquire. That being said, Gilmore Girls: The Complete Series box set is a must have. This DVD box set contain forty two DVD's numbered 1-42, with all 154 fun and witty episodes.  There are also extra bonus features aswell. Some of these special features include a \\"Welcome to the Gilmore Girls\\" documentary, deleted scenes from a few of the episodes, numerous \\"behind the scenes\\" extras, and a commentary by the creators, Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, on the episode called \\"I Jump, You Jump Jack.\\"  There is also an Episode Guide Book that gives short explanations of all the episodes, makes it easy to find whichever show you want to watch, and is full of pictures from throughout the series. Another extremely useful extra that is included in this box set is the \\"Gilmore-isms\\" booklet. This booklet is a helpful tool that tries to clarify the many popular culture references that are used throughout the series. This booklet says what the popular culture reference is and which episode it appeared in to make it quick and easy to find exactly what you are looking for. Besides the Barbie-like cover that does not do the series justice and does not fit the personality of Gilmore Girls, this box set has many extra features along with the magnificent series that make it worth purchasing.     Gilmore Girls is a series that I would strongly encourage anyone, even those who are skeptical, to watch. This fast paced, whimsical dramedy will capture your heart, and you won't be able to take your eyes away. All seven wonderful season are full of new and interesting plotlines and characters that will keep you coming back for more.
B001AX60KU|2.0|Sony/BMG purchased RCA years ago and since then they have destroyed the entire Elvis catalog and saturated the market with multiple compilations --How many times do we need to have \\"Hound Dog\\"?????-- instead or reissuing Elvis' original catalog in a fine remastered way with eco packaging and original artwork--as is the latest trend and one that is quite appealing. But, what else would you expect from a foreign company? (Sony/BMG is a German company).<br /><br />However, SONY/BMG does not hold the rights to everything that Elvis recorded. In fact, Graceland has formed FTD (Follow That Dream records) and they issue top-quality cds for the true Elvis fan. Hard to get performances well worth the money--a few dollars more than the standard cd.<br /><br />So, if you really want Elvis' music as it should be, you can find the original studio releases and then go to [...] and purchase great cds from Graceland! Say NO to Sony/BMG!

1554684838|5.0|I loved this book. Colum McCann is a very talented writer: his prose is elegant, spare, and evocative. I was totally engaged from the moment I read the first paragraph. I was not able to put this book down and I told all my friends they just \\"had\\" to read it.<br /><br />I recommended \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" for our book group (10 women, all of us have kids, and we meet once a month). Almost everyone in the group loved it.  There were a couple of people who thought it was too complicated and had trouble with the fact that the first chapters seem almost unconnected from one another, until you realize that each deals with a character who is experiencing the same events from a different perspective. But most of us agreed that this was one of the best books we've ever read.
0740748475|5.0|I don't just love this set of Calvin and Hobbes, I ADORE it!  There's a lot behind Bill Watterson that people just don't know.  The first book introduces his back story, and a bit about how he came about creating the characters.  It adds to his already wonderful comic!    I love that this is the whole collection of Calvin and Hobbes.  I've been a fan for many many years, and have quite a few of the books.  This set is simply amazing.    Warning: It's VERY heavy (but why wouldn't you expect that seeing it's his complete collection).  There's 3 books inside a box (so it really makes a great collectors set).    If you or someone you know if a C&H fan, I highly recommend!  It's a keepsake to cherish!
B0000AK7AB|5.0|I bought Babe for my grandson. He calls it the \\"Pig Movie\\" and watches it daily. He loves to watch the animals talk and laugh!
006056251X|3.0|It amazes me that people loved this book so much.  It must be just me, because I can't fathom how a wallflower who is not at all pretty, is socially awkward, and stutters more than speaks coherently can possibly be expected to snare St. Vincent.  I realize that St. Vincent needs money, but considering how many women dangle after him, I should think that finding an heiress wouldn't be too difficult.  So, that hurt the plot a little bit.  I like them to be a little more believable.  She should have had some other quality that made her irresistible or something.  Maybe her wit, maybe the way she looks seductive...SOMETHING!  The whole time I couldn't get past the fact that a man like St. Vincent wouldn't look twice at her, especially once she opened her mouth.    With that in mind, there is still something to be said for the underdog.  It would be a real bore if every woman was blindingly beautiful, had a brain as sharp as a tack, etc.  But the love story between the two never really made me feel as though he loved her.  I think he felt sorry for her and what she went through.  It seemed to be a dark story, not only in the love aspect but even the setting, and title.  I'm sure that was intentional, but I sure didn't like it.  It completely steps away from the cheerfulness of [[ASIN:0061259349 Secrets of a Summer Night (The Wallflowers, Book 1)]] and [[ASIN:0061259330 It Happened One Autumn (The Wallflowers, Book 2)]].  I absolutely loved both of those books.  I felt the love between the characters wasn't forced but rather an undeniable attraction that blossomed.  I'm all for the marriage before love aspect.  It usually makes for some interesting plot twists, but I found that St. Vincent seemed to be more interested in the gambling club than Evie.  And Evie more interested in her father/brother/horrible family than St. Vincent.      Another reviewer mentioned this, and it rings so true.  For a man that seems to have no heart (St. Vincent), so much so that he kidnaps hisbest-friend's girl to force her into marriage with him, he all of a sudden seems not so horrible throughout this whole book.  No evil streak, no getting over him being evil.  He just isn't.  That seemed weird and not with his character up until now.    I think there are a little too many obstacles in the characters of Evie and St. Vincent (both internal and external) where the love just supposedly happens somewhere when they are conquering them.  I'm much more of a sucker to learn about the love by them interacting on a more continual basis, and the problems in their relationship be between them, not the past.  Man, but I hate it when characters have the I-had-a-troubled-childhood-so-I-am-a-broken-person-until-my-lover-can-save-me-from-my-past. Please.  Rarely does that plot work, unless it's the man.  Then it can seem sexy because he is distant/closed/cold/heartless.    While I've been bashing the book,I wouldn't say don't read it. It's just not up to par.  I think it's an average book, so it gets an average rating.  I much prefer the first two in the series.  I LOVED both of the main characters in those stories.  I felt I knew them on a deeper level.

B002RAREAK|4.0|Usher certainly does not disappoint with Raymond Vs. Raymond.  All talented entertainers have that one breakthrough album in their career and in most cases its hard to duplicate that success.  I say this to make the point that so many people expect a Confessions Part 2 and its not going to happen folks, let it go!! Here I Stand was a solid effort but not highly promoted.  This go around it seems Usher decided to go more edgy but still provides the fans with trademark ballads.  The album opens with Monstar which is quite different but has a nice feel and after a few listens I was hooked, other highlights are There goes my baby, the club hits Hey Daddy and Lil Freak.  Mars vs Venus which is my favorite, ProLover, Okay and Making Love into the night are clearly for the grown and sexy and Usher's vocals are on point as usual.  He has proven over time that he is here to stay in the game, record sales don't matter at this point, been there....Nice album!!!!    Favorites  1. Mars Vs Venus  2. Foolin Around  3. Pro Lover  4. Monstar  5. Making love (into the noght)  6. Oaky  7. Lil Freak
B002VECM4A|4.0|As a teacher I know of many kids similar to this predicament but this is the story of one set in Harlem circa 1987 and about an extremely obese 16 year old Clarice Precious Jones, who has below average reading levels and has severe problems of self worthiness, she has been abused by her father since she was three. She reads at about first grade level and when she is found to be pregnant by her father for a second time, the counselor arranges for her to enroll at the alternative high school. Although she has a desire to learn, her mother strongly discourages her attempts to educate herself and insists that she get welfare. The movie chronicles the growth of Precious in to a woman who is ready to take responsibility and even head for college. If you notice the words at the beginning of the film are misspelled but at the end they are spelt correctly which in my opinion indicates that not only her literacy skills have improved but the world has also begun to make more sense.<br />The center of the film is the abusive relationship that Precious has with her mother and her ultimate solace in the classroom under the watchful, caring and kind eye of her teacher, Blu rain played by Paula Patton.  Gabourey Sidibe is wonderfully cast in the title role and gives us a remarkable performance. Mariah Carey is Mrs. Weiss, in an important role as a welfare worker. I thought that anyone could have played the role but to see Mariah without makeup is a revelation in itself. Lenny Kravitz is an assistant nurse and he is suitable in the brief role. However the home run is hit by Mo' nique who gives us a great performance as the evil welfare mom, in a scene that makes you both hate her and feel sad for her,  she accuses Precious for stealing her man when she learns that she is pregnant with her second son. She is also excellent as the depressed withdrawn person who lives on welfare and only steps out to play lottery. Just watch her in the scene with Mariah Carey and Precious in the movie's final moments.<br />Although this movie is depressing enough it is in the end optimistic and offers hope to the many Precious's out there. I gave it four stars. 3/31/10nal moments.   Although this movie is depressing enough it is in the end optimistic and offers hope to the many Precious's out there. I gave it four stars. 3/31/10

B001FB55L2|4.0|Brothers' is about two brothers and an American version of a Danish film `Brodre'. They are played Jake Gyllenhaal and Tobey Maguire, they are also not alike. Jake is an ex con and Tobey is Marine Corp who is a family man married to Natalie Portman and getting ready to go to Afghanistan. He is deployed and in a few days the news arrives that he has died. But he does not instead he is captured by the Taliban and as a prisoner of war undergoes some gruesome torture. His sorrowful wife is unable to believe that he has left them but somehow during the course of the absence becomes very close to his brother Jake Gyllenhaal (Tommy), but they maintain a platonic relationship. The children become close to their uncle and the family starts mending their frayed relationship with Gyllenhaal. Until, one day Sam (Tobey Maguire) returns but he is a changed man both physically and mentally and the strains start to show. In my opinion, the story while sufficiently powerful was not enough to make this movie watchable but the chemistry between the lead actors and the direction. All three leads put in a brave, balanced and a polished performance that is beyond their years. I loved Tobey Maguire and how he managed to convey the mental anguish of a traumatized soldier. The child stars are great in their roles and the rest of the cast supports well. The movie is a reminder of the service that our servicemen are providing out country and the heartbreak, trials and tribulations that they and their families go through every day. This movie while not overtly political does question the futility of war. Finally the song Winter by U2 has been used to great haunting effect. I liked the movie and I give it four stars. 3/29/10
B0013MWVYC|3.0|The reason that I gave it a three star is I actually find it very helpful for myself.  I always had a \\"fixed\\" mindset (bad), and now after reading the book I feel more \\"growth\\" mind set (good).  Interestingly there is not much else in the book.    Like most reviewer who gave a low score, I do agree that this should be more like an interesting article than a whole book.  Basically reading the first chapter and last chapter is good enough to get the idea of the book, all the stuff in between are basically \\"padded\\" examples.  So well done on the marketing and publicity department for making a book with so little.    A practical follow up guide will definetly help both the reader(how to put theory into practice) and the author (financially).  So this is a win win situation.

B001OQCV2E|4.0|2012 was hyped up as the ultimate disaster movie, but I really wasn't sure what to expect going in.  The trailers made it look like it was going to be...possibly hokey, but I heard great things about it.  It's directed by Roland Emmerich, who has never helmed a boring movie yet, but at the same time they usually have some intangible weakness that keep them from coming together and reaching their full potential (at least in my opinion).  [[ASIN:B00005JMXX The Day After Tomorrow (Widescreen Edition)]] was visually fantastic and had a few good angles in there, but the story felt overly contrived and didn't gel for me.  [[ASIN:B00008G8M4 Independence Day]] and Emmerich's version of [[ASIN:0767817478 Godzilla]] both started off awesome.  The first twenty minutes or so of Godzilla made it look like it was going to be a dynamite movie, and the first 45 minutes or so of Independance Day was incredible, but both movies started steeply downhill shortly thereafter.  Now, all these were worth seeing, but...   As for 2012, imagine the opening parts of movies like Independance Day that look so promising, and then imagine that it never goes downhill, but lives up to its full potential.  2012 did that.  Emmerich pulled all the elements together and delivered the film of his career, and one of the best big-budget disaster epics ever.       Based loosely on the fact that the ancient Mayan civilization's highly detailed and accurate calendar ends abruptly in the year 2012, a point that some have interpreted as a prophecy of some dire event in that year, the movie 2012 opens with everyday research into solar activity coming up with some sharply disturbing data.  The amount of neutrinos - tiny subatomic particles emitted by stars - that are coming out of our Sun is escalating sharply.  Neutrinos are so small that the vast majority of them pass through an object even as large as the Earth without connecting with anything: they just slip right through the gaps between atoms and molecules.  However, a very small amount of them do bump into an atom here or there, but the effect on anything larger than the sub-microscopic scale is infintessimal.  2012 posits that with a huge surge in the number of neutrinos and hence the number of neutrino impacts, the results could be unpredictable and bad.  In the movie, the result that's already begun from this increase is that the inner Earth is starting to heat up - quickly.  This information is brought to the world's leaders, who keep it secret but actually start taking actions immediately.       Fast forward to the year 2012 and the heating of the inner Earth is escalating far faster than the scientists predicted in their gravest calculations, and it appears Doomsday may be imminent.  When disaster begins hitting, it is indeed what it looked like in the trailers - every conceivable disaster movie angle from floods to earthquakes to volcanoes and beyond - all breaking loose at once.  But they've actually gone and worked out a single root cause to tie it all together, which is a big plus.  There's a wide cast of characters, including the scientists who originally discovered the internal heating, a novelist (John Cusack) who wrote a disaster novel whose events parralell many of the happenings and who stumbles into the main flow of things, his family, including his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and their children as well as the ex-wife's new beau (in a nice change from stereotype, neither the 'ex-husband' or the 'new guy' gets cast in the 'jerk' role, and the two actually work together well as the group attempts to find safety amidst the chaos), the American president and his daughter, a Russian billionaire and his entourage, and so on.  Basically - a wide, diverse group.  The characters are actually interesting and, for the most part, likable.  The good guys aren't necesarily perfect, and the shady characters generally aren't without some redeeming value.  So you've got a large group of people you really care what happens to.  Throw in the fact that the moments of wit and humor really work this time out instead of falling flat like they sometimes do in big action epics; plus crust displacement theory and references to the fact that the Earth's poles actually have switched positions over the eons; plus awesome visual effects; and even some inspirational themes that don't come off as forced, and you've got one powerful epic.       Critics will point out that 2012 isn't necesarily the most realistic movie ever made, but it's not so glaringly Un-realistic as to be a pain.  Actually more believable than I thought it would be, and a few sequences that might be a tad 'over-amped' or excessively optimistic can be justified in a blast of a movie like this.  And any excess can also be cleared away by the unexpectedly strong message of the movie that in a catacylsm like this, maybe it would actually bring out the best in the world instead of an instant turn to global barbarism.  2012 is recommended for all, but especially for fans of disaster movies like [[ASIN:B0002V7OI8 Deep Impact (Special Collector's Edition)]] and [[ASIN:0783225547 Dante's Peak]], or of Emmerich's previous movies like [[ASIN:B0000844I8 Stargate (Ultimate Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0012Q732O 10,000 B.C.]] (his two best before prior to this one, in my opinion).
B00005N5S2|5.0|\\"MacArthur\\" is a thundering triumph of a film, much as MacArthur was as a man. Released in 2001 by Universal Studios, \\"MacArthur\\" is 2 hours and 10 minutes in length, and stars Gregory Peck as the heroic, egotistical, and brilliant General of the Army and Medal of Honor recipient Douglas MacArthur. Peck's performance of his role as the great General is not just an ordinary role in an ordinary movie- it is the performance of a career, of a lifetime. It is some of the best acting I have ever seen. And its not just Peck, though he could have easily carried the entire film by himself. MacArthur, with his love of dramatics and delight in being the center of everything, knew no other way. Director Joseph Sargent did a superb job, especially with the aid of the magnificent Jerry Goldsmith as the designer of the movie's soundtrack. Compared with the books on MacArthur such as \\"American Caesar\\", \\"MacArthur\\" is very short and devoid of many details. But to make a movie that truly told the story of Douglas MacArthur from beginning to end, you'd have to make a series of four-hour films, not just one that runs half of that. Sargent compressed the story of MacArthur's career from before Bataan to after Korea very well.<br /><br />MacArthur was outrageously egotistical and dramatic, always wanting to put on a show when he could have done what most people would have called the more sensible or practical thing to do. On one occasion in the film, a GI warns him to stay down while he is visiting a frontline area, noting that his unit had killed several Japanese snipers nearby not long ago. Not disturbed in the slightest, MacArthur nods approvingly and says, \\"That's the best thing to do with them!\\" During the siege of Bataan, he was seen more than once calmly watching the Japanese planes attacking- standing outside the bunkers. This film deserves the same recognition 'Patton' enjoys, and I confidently rank George C. Scott's performance in that film and Gregory Peck's in this one on the same level. MacArthur was a man who could turn the making of a cup of coffee into an epic saga worth writing a play about, and this movie captures that part of him superbly. It depicts his brilliance, his total disregard for the danger the enemy posed, his colossal ego and his incredible skill as a strategist and as a leader. All those remarkable traits build him into a five star general and Medal of Honor recipient as the film goes on, until his becomes this unstoppable force that bowls over the Joint Chiefs, the Red Chinese and North Koreans, anyone who gets in his way. Until he meets with Harry Truman, played by yet another superb actor, Ed Flanders, who when learning of the General's flaunting his authority and destroying his attempts to establish a cease fire with the Chinese with a ludicrously arrogant ultimatum, declares, \\"I'm gonna fire his insubordinate *** right now!\\" MacArthur, a man who had gotten used to having his way, had finally run into someone who was as stubborn as he was. Relieved of command, he returns to the United States, received by an enraptured and joyous American public. At the conclusion of the film, Peck makes a stunning rendition of MacArthur's \\"Duty, Honor, Country\\" speech that is every bit as good as the version done by the General himself.<br /><br />To anyone who is interested in learning about one of West Point's most distinguished graduates, a man whose incredible brilliance, unparalleled strategic skill, unquestionable courage and colossal ego made and ended his career, I highly recommend \\"MacArthur\\". It is truly lamentable that this film is not anywhere near as famous as it should be.vel.

0812973992|1.0|I got this book based on the reviews.  I am sad to say that I did not find this book interesting at all. It started out pretty good in Ireland and then just kept going downhill from there.  I did not find any of the characters interesting.  I read about 1/4 of the book and gave up.  I have to say, I read a lot of books and this is the first one I didn't finish.  I think this book is way over hyped.
B0036EBARO|5.0|The eighties sound made a big comeback last year with acts like La Roux, Empire of the sun, and Patrick Wolf. The rennaissance continues in 2010 with acts like Ellie Goulding, Groove Armada, and Delphic.<br /><br />Add to that list, English Electronic duo Goldfrapp. Their new 9 track CD \\"Head first\\" recalls Irene Cara, Donna Summer, Madonna, and even Pet Shop Boys.<br /><br />Bouncy Synth driven numbers like lead-off single \\"Rocket\\" and \\"Believer\\" wouldn't have sounded out of place on the \\"Flashdance\\" soundtrack. Other upbeat songs are \\"Alive\\", the quivering \\"Dreaming\\" (perfectly showcasing Alison Goldfrapp's feathery vocals flitting from lower register to sky high falsetto), the bouncy Glam Rock/Pop \\"Shiny and warm\\", and the dark yet beautiful \\"I wanna life\\" (on which she sounds a bit like Gwen Stefani in places, lovely vocal layering too).<br /><br />\\"Head first\\" is a beautiful synth ballad. The atmospheric \\"Hunt\\" is a lovely reverb-laden ballad, while closing is the trippy psychedelic instrumental \\"Voicething\\" with a flickering synth riff, and adorned in places with ethereal humming and harmonies.<br /><br />Nothing is ever less than thrilling. Listening to this album is like floating carefree in the clouds. Another winner from the pair.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|I've read lots of opinions about the ending, most of which say Teddy was insane and was Andrew, the killer of his wife.  There are a lot of compelling reasons for this theory, but most are missing one thing.  In the movie it is stated that the project at the island might be to make unfeeling sleeper soldiers.  Someone saw Teddy, with his troubled background, (somewhat obsessed with the killer of his wife, a guilt-wracked soldier from WWII) as a perfect candidate fit for the \\"job\\".  Thus the drugging and psychological brainwashing to make him think he is the insane Andrew.  The verdict on his \\"healing\\" (brainwashing) came out negative.  They couldn't break him.  He would not be a sleeper.  That is why he said the last line.  He would rather die a good person (lobotomized or whatever -- for sure never leaving the island) than live as a monster, meaning an unfeeling killing machine for the military.  His calling the doctor Chuck is sarcasm -- rubbing it in that for all the doctor's efforts, Teddy was the stronger man in the end.

B000002C2E|5.0|I've been a Dylan fan since I was 14 and  never listened to anything after \\"Blood on the Tracks\\". I heard the \\"better\\" selections from the later albums on greatest hits collections etc. but never thought investing in another complete album would be worth my time...how wrong I was. This album, as many others have stated is right up there with the other classics. Dylan is fierce on this album.<br /><br />I realize what it is I have been relating to in Dylan all of these years. It's his simmering anger that appeals to me most. His defiant yet realistic expression, a careless hopelessness. I dig it. In this album he's burnt out and doesn't care anymore. He's sick of love and cold irons bound and gonna walk on down that road until his eyes begin to bleed. The air burns and I know what he means.<br /><br />It's funny how my favorite lyricists, Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan, feel OK about expressing a sense of hopelessness and disdain for humanity in a time when we need hope. But I guess it's always been that way.<br /><br />\\"It's hard watching something beautiful decay\\" says Dylan \\"but it's harder still when your heart turns away.\\" The sound of the nail being hit on the head is what makes Dylan reign supreme.<br /><br />Buy this album, go through the drive through liquor store, turn it up,crack open yer poison and head on down the road.
B0038P59A0|5.0|This is the first movie I have seen this year that was worth a crap. I wouldnt have pictured Downey / Law playing Holmes / Watson, but they did an excellent job. The visuals were great, it had a story line that kept me very interested, and the fight scenes were very cool (whilst still remaining within the laws of physics most of the time). IMHO this is an incredible movie that was probably drowned out by hype over New Moon. Sorry ladies, no sparkly emo kids here, or sweaty shirtless dog boys. Only 2 hours of mystery, explosions, and good old fashioned ass kicking.

B0026OE2NY|3.0|Five stars for stunning visuals and final message that gives a glimpse on alternative energy but...    narrator killed it big time. I just could not connect with female narrator. It appeared to me as if a Mathematics teacher is writing equations on board while speaking and never turned to audience for the entire lecture (yes it sounds lecture).    The voice-over script changes from \\"you've damaged the environment\\" to \\"we've to sort it out\\" so many times that it makes you wonder if the script was written by dozens of people and nobody reviewed it during compilation.    If you are like me, who already understands the seriousness of issues pertaining to global warming and doing his own share of service, just enjoy it on mute (although I somehow survived the unfriendly voice).

B000005DQR|5.0|Turbid, impudent, and at times, soothing, Entroducing..., DJ Shadow's debut, is by far one of the best experiences I've had in, not simply in rap, but music in general. Taking over a hundred samples and weaving them into pure orchestra fashion, Shadow is original in every way. You've got your highs, lows and in between affliction. In view, the only other producer that can snag my ears without self made vocals as in this album is J-Dilla (R.I.P.). It's not the 96' expression of pop rap fusion soon to come or the violate gangsta personal that dominated the airwaves at the time that brandishes it's sound, but the simplistic, authentic, emotional spectacle that can be thrown at you in its 60+ minutes of pleasure. ***** ALL TIME CLASSIC

He wasn't the greatest writer in the world structurally or stylistically, but his IDEAS sing and soar beyond that.<br />Electric Sheep isn't an easy book to understand if you come looking for Blade Runner because that is only about 1/4, or less of the book. Most of the book is a rather humdrum account of a mans' slide into some sort of odd mental state helped by a dying world, a crass wife and a very VERY odd religion.<br />If you want Blade Runner, read the novelization.

B001HN694K|2.0|i thought about this. this movie has terrible values. most over-blown large budget film making often does. there was no need for yet another version of 'Alice'. and this one is the worst. it makes the Irwin Allen adaptation look good.     who would be so foolish as to let a kid see a movie where a young girl walks up to a very old woman and tells her she's deluded? she's an old woman with very little time left to change. that was bratty, rude, and uncivil. Carroll believed in civility and would have trumped that situation fast. there was no point to it. it was wrong. Burton's Alice needs to grow up and stop bossing everyone around.   also it's foolish to tell your children \\"that some of the very best people are insane\\". insanity and mental illness are much more complex than that. children should be careful about mental illness, it's a dark unhappy thing and some mentally ill people can be dangerous. not all, but some. so be careful!                                                 Tim Burton's direction and Johhny Depp's performance were very good, but Linda Woolverton's screenplay was ridiculous tripe and not worthy of the original story by Carroll. I hated everything about the way she ended this. equating feminism with commerce and rudeness. shame on her, she is a total beast.   you are better off with the beautiful Jonathan Miller version or the original Disney cartoon classic than with this idiotic, over commercialized junk.    if you must have your children watch this than you get what you get. it's maybe not the worst film in the world, but it's shallow, thoughtless and vacuous. is that how you want your children to grow up? if it is, then i would'nt want to be YOU for anything in this world. i've pretty much had it with everyone's brainless tampering with all that is right, sound and clearly good.    goodbye, good luck, and GOOD RIDDANCE! the very idea indeed!                                                 james(the 'Alice' fan)

There have been so many movies out there with psycho stalkers, and all have been pretty lame.   While this movie has basically the same plot line, it differs in Derrick; the main character does not show any interest in his psycho stalker Nicole.  I mean NO interest.  He is very clear with her that he is happily married to his wife Sharon.  Still she stalks him and has crazy delusions of their imaginary future together.  This chic is absolutely crazy!  Sharon finds out about her husband's stalker when Nicole (the stalker) tries to commit suicide in Derricks room during the work outing.  That is not even the worst of what this crazy bitch does to these poor people.  You'll have to watch the movie.  I will tell you this; Sharon (the wife) is bad ass!  In other movies the wives seemed fragile, you felt bad for them.    You do not have to feel bad for Sharon, she is no joke!   Let's just say she gets her revenge, and oh how sweet it is.  This movie was great!   It had me fired up the whole time.  Ladies, I am telling you, you are going to want to go through the TV and kick this girl's ass for Sharon.   Gentlemen this may be a chic flick, but if you take anything from this movie I hope it is this;  NEVER EVER keep something like this from your significant other.   It will not turn out good for you.  Crazy chics just don't go away. They just get crazier.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I have read thousands of books thoughout the years and this one takes the cake as my favorite. In Shutter Island, Dennis Lehane takes you on a ride that you will never forget and you won't find in any other book. This book is highly recomended and will be the best $5 you will ever spend!
B00129H7VS|5.0|I have been waiting and waiting until I finally broke down and brought this excellent production. It was well worth the wait, I am not a fan of war movies but I saw Saving Private Ryan it was excellent work and it was the only reason I was interested in this production. This collection is the way to go.
B00325WFH6|5.0|From the back cover: Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood. I never asked to be the son of a greed god. I was just a normal kid, going to school, playing basketball, skateboarding. The usual. Until I accidentally vaporized my maths teacher. That's when things really started going wrong. Now I spend my time fighting with swords, battling monsters with my friends and generally trying to stay alive. This is the one where Zeus, God of the Sky, thinks I've stolen his lightning bolt - and making Zeus angry is a very bad idea.    I had the Percy Jackson series on my TBR list for a really long time, and when I found out a movie was made I decided I had to read it sooner rather than later. I really enjoyed this book. I briefly studied ancient Greek myth at university (which I loved) and it was so great to revisit these characters in a whole new way. Without giving away any spoilers, I loved what Rick Riordan did with them, translating them into a modern context, and how he used them - especially Dionysus, it's just too funny. I don't think it will effect enjoyment of the story if you are not familiar with Greek myth, the characters are all well developed and described. All the traditional elements of the hero's journey including hazards and triumphs are included and keep the story interesting.    I loved that Percy is not a straight A kind of student, that he has a difficult home life, learning difficulties and a few behavioural problems - his quick comebacks are so clever, I'm sure Rick Riordan has used a few of the ones that have been flung at him during his time teaching middle school! Percy's friends provide a lot of great humour as well, I found much of the story pretty amusing, and I'm sure when I was younger I would have found it hilarious.     Overall, I really enjoyed this book, and strongly recommend giving it a read if you like reading children's books. It is probably also a good book for reluctant readers.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|It is great to have the best of KD's songs all in one collection, gathered from albums--recent and not so recent.
B000001GGV|5.0|Somehow strange, I decided to get this album - Ivo Pogorelich playing 15 Scarlatti Sonatas - many years after it was recorded and issued by Deutsche Grammophon. It simply happened shortly after attending Ivo's live recital in Bucharest during the \\"George Enescu\\" International Festival in September 2003. On that occasion, he offered some Beethoven Sonatas - the F sharp minor op.78 and the celebrated op.111 - coupled with pieces by Rachmaninoff and Scriabin. Though flawless from technical viewpoint, his approach raised then many doubts (especially in Beethoven works) concerning the rhythmic licenses he indulged himself. Namely, he developed and employed a very slow pace, phrasing against the use, in order to convey the musical truth of those scores and - perhaps - to ostentatiously shade a new light on them. But this questionable manner in which Pogorelich decided to lead then the Beethovenian discourse baffled the audience. An audience aware of the fact that it was experiencing a great virtuoso's music-making, but unable to assume what it was hearing. For many, such an approach seemed totally inappropriate and even disturbing, causing the frustration that the world conjured up from the keyboard was quite totally Ivo's and not even a single bit Beethoven's. The concert-goers' habits and expectations were blown up from the very first bars. For others - taking Beethoven as a mere pretext for a personal confession - was quite the clue of that evening. However, the procedure was less bothering in Russian repertoire filling the second half of the recital. The sole encore to come at the end of the recital (Balakirev's Islamey) exhibited such a muscular power and delirious tempos as if Pogorelich wanted to convince us that he knows very well what we were expecting from a high calibre virtuoso like him and can offer that. But only if he feels - and wants - to!<br /><br />Therefore, incited in a way by that live performance, I went for his recordings. I must say this Scarlattiselection can be definitely considered as a gem of the catalogue. Pogorelich shines at every moment, exhibiting different facets and moods of his artistic personality. He plays in a sparkling youthful way, with a graceful touch and a natural tempo - obviously, more vivid and evocative than he uses lately - adapted with particular inflexions to every sonata he chose to include in this programme. A programme once more attractive, since Pogorelich knows how to imbue it with that Iberian flavour Scarlatti was aiming at. Centered on the witty Sonata in G major K 13 which evokes a Fest at the Spain Court, the recital alternates serene recollections with elegant upsurges. The lively finger-work is not a vehicle but part of the music's essence, as Scarlatti entitled his sonatas `Essercizi'.<br /><br />The sound is excellent and the album constitutes a true landmark of the recorded Scarlatti. Delightful and inexhaustible source of joy!
B003BYYDXW|1.0|Bought this for my 12 year old daughter who \\"HAD\\" to have it. Absolutely worthless album. Formula, predictable.. I teased her by humming along in the car the frist time I heard it. This is another Disney creation, kid turned over to studio musicians becomes front man for teen band. BTW, the kid who HAD to have it, listened to twice before she moved on.. it's a yawner. Turns out she likes the idea of Justin Bieber better than actually have to listen to the music of Justin Bieber.
B0001O2KQW|5.0|Literally hundreds of Elvis live concerts have been released, both by RCA and the bootleggers, but this is one of his all time best. Released just one year after his famous \\"Aloha\\" concerts, this performance is superior in every way. Elvis is full of good humor and sounds very at ease with his hometown fans. It's a shame this album sold so poorly in comparison to \\"Aloha,\\" This is one of the very few Presley albums to win a Grammy, for the inspirational powerhouse \\"How Great Thou Art.\\" His vocals on that song and songs like \\"Tryin' To Get To You\\" are nothing less than awe-inspiring! If you're a new Elvis fan and would like to add a few live shows to your collection, then this is a fine place to start!
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I received the DVD a few days earlier than expected, and in an unexpected way.    There was a knock on the door, it was maybe 2 in the morning. I don't really remember. I slowly got out of bed and peeked through the doorhole to see who it could possibly be.    It was Bill effing Murray. Dressed up as a ghostbuster. When I opened the door, he clicked a remote to turn on a stereo boombox he had with him. Ghostbusters theme blaring, he starts dancing. 70's disco style.    After \\"WHO YOU GONNA CALL,\\" he held the DVD case up to my face and paused the song. I was silent, he lowered the case and put it in my face again.    \\"Ghostbusters?\\" I asked.    He started the music again, put the dvd down on my doormat, took the boombox and danced away.    I opened up the DVD case when I got back inside, and on the INSIDE of the SHRINK WRAPPED DVD CASE, I kid you not there was a note that read    \\"No one will ever believe you. No one buys DVDs anymore.\\"    I got noise complaints from other people in the apartment the next day. I told them I was sorry and wouldn't play my music so loud. Let's face it. No one would believe otherwise.      Excellent DVD. High quality video and audio, and the extras are AWESOME.

0517548232|5.0|This is the most easily-understood book on economics I have ever come across. It should be required reading beginning in 5th grade. If one can understand true economics, one can understand why America is beginning to deteriorate as a World Power.
B0036XN2L2|4.0|I've been a Scorpions fan since '84 when Love at 1st sting hit the rock world. I have mixed emotions regarding this album because it is the end of the road for one of my all-time favorite bands. This album is very fitting for a grand finale IMO. Most songs sound like they could have been recorded in the 80's, which is not necessarily a bad thing. My favorites on \\"Sting in the tail\\" are the title track, (Sting in the tail) Turn You On, No Limit, & Lorelei. The thing that I most like about the album is that this is no-frills, fun Scorpions. There are so many elements of classic Scorps heard in almost every song. I guess it's ok to steal or recycle riffs from yourselves?  Of course, (ironically) this is also a slight letdown because I don't feel that it is a new Scorpions record. It almost feels & sounds like a reunion album. I would compare it to KISS-Psycho Circus... A retrospective album that includes riffs, lyrics & other references to previous Scorpions songs or even a previous era. When you listen to any song on this album you know that it is the Scorpions because it sounds like the Scorpions. The Scorpions took the AC/DC approach here... \\"if it ain't broke, then don't fix it\\". I can not help but think about how long these guys have been rocking, and how great they were. The good news here is that the band sounds great, and there's no hidden agenda or message. This is not a deep album like Humanity or Face the Heat. This is more like Stay Hungry or Metal Health. I'm sure that these songs will sound great live in concert, and they will fit right in with all the classics. Overall a great effort from an AWESOME rock band!!!
1932100660|1.0|I started this book hoping for some good information on the links between diet and disease, specifically cancer. The author had a pretty amazing dataset to work with and could have drawn some interesting theories from this dataset. Instead he uses the data to blindly promote his own biases towards 100% veganism. I eat very healthy, organic food and probably 90% fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. So I have no bias towards people who promote whole foods and mostly fruits and vegetables. In fact, I'm probably biased towards them. However, I did have major problems with the sloppiness of this book. Just some of the problems:    1) The author gives us many correlations between meat and disease and jumps straight to his conclusion that meat protein causes many diseases. But not once does he off a theory as to why this occurs or the mechanism by which this occurs. How is that science? Where is the theory?    2) The author went into the study of the data looking for these correlations. He was not unbiased. Therefore we should already be very skeptical of his conclusions.     3) Where is the discussion of the diet on which humans evolved? Clearly the most healthy diet is the one we evolved on. That diet includes meat. Not much meat, but it certainly includes meat. Again, the author loses much credibility by not even mentioning evolution and diet together. Very disappointing.    4) The author does not once make an exception for fish. It is well known that many, if not most, human cultures evolved on the coasts and ate a lot of fish. We know fish is very different than red meat in terms of how the human body processes and uses it. Yet the author lumps fish in with steak and chicken.    5) In probably the most incredible leap of faith the author has the gall to say that it doesn't really matter if you eat organic foods or not. Just don't eat meat and everything will be fine. You can't get most diseases if you don't eat meat, according to the author. That is downright dangerous advice.     If you want to read well thought out, unbiased books on nutrition that are incredibly well written read the books of Michael Pollan. In Defense of Food and Omnivore's Dilemma are the bibles of nutrition to me.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I love this movie I did not see it in the theaters and eagerly awaited the Blu-ray release and not disappointed in this movie...not one bit, action packed the fight scenes how they go over them in detail I thought was very cool, the CG were amazing. I love some of the history in the other posts that I have read here and actually read the book when I was a little boy and can remember some of the details discussed here. Robert Downey Jr. is fast becoming a favorite actor in my house.

B002UZXJA6|5.0|I don't typically buy this kind of CD but when I saw an ad for it on tv, I just had to have it. I'm so glad that I got it!  If you love beautiful voices, great lyrics and Irish music, you will LOVE Celtic Woman. There are classics like, Amazing Grace. There are also some very lively Irish folk instrumental pieces and even a song written by Billy Joel.  I don't usually like other peoples' covers of his music (I'm a huge fan of his and I think he does his own music better than anyone else).  Celtic Woman did B.J.'s \\"Lullaby (Goodnight my Angel)\\", and it is so beautiful!.  I would recommend this cd for anyone who likes a good old fashioned Irish jig, songs with great lyrics that tell beautiful stories sung with beatiful voices and all of it backed by an amazing orchestra.

0393072231|5.0|Big Short tells us an important part of the story of the recent financial catastrophe in this country.  It was  entirely foreseeable.  But, it wasnt foreseen by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury,the SEC, or any other agency responsible for protecting the public interest.      This has important consequences for future policy.  We learn what we already knew or should have known:  Wall Street cannot be relied upon to protect any part of the public interest.     So,we must create a financial environment in which incentives do not favor dangerous short term bets over long term investment.  That a small group of traders, brokers, originators,  and  their bosses made themselve rich from the  \\"profits\\" they earned when times were good, but dumped their losses on the public when times were bad,  is profane, and dangerous.  This must be fixed.  Or else.    The consequences of the catastrophe will affect our lives for generations.  We have spent several trillion dollars bailing out the financial industry, ourselves, and the economy as a whole.  The culprits kept their bonuses and, in many cases, their jobs.    The problem is we did not have several trillion dollars to spend.  Instead, we  borrowed the money from our grandchildren.    This has consequences.  Either (1) the money must be  repaid,  with interest,  which  will mean  it cannot be used to invest, create jobs, or pay for socially beneficial programs in the future; or (2)  The debt must be repudiated, either openly or by inflating ourselves out of the debt.  Either result will mean a worse future for our grandchildren.    All that we got for this meaner future was to be able to pay a handful of traders and their bosses fortunes that often exceeded in one year a lifetimes wages for the typical worker.     This is not only wrong, it is dangerous.  If enough voters come to conclude the game is rigged, and the result is a meaner future for their children and grandchildren, our experiment with economic Democracy may cometo an end.      Justifiably so,  most would say.
B0027BOL4G|3.0|Very left wing view of what's happening...so some of the blame game is a little far fetched...this problem didn't happen in just the last 10 years. But the info, descriptions and processes that are ACTUALLY filmed are alarming, and needs to be brought to the public.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I got these headphones at Target for $9.99 and I love them.  I use them at work to listen to music primarily.  One of the main reasons I like these is the fact that I can still hear the phone ringing or people that come up to me and need to talk.  The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price.  The comfort is good as well.  I wear these headphones several hours a day and my ears are not sore at all.  I did have to buy an extension cord because the cord is not very long.  Overall, I highly recommend these if you want a good sounding, comfortable pair of headphones at a great price.
1400052173|5.0|What a triumph of research and writing, turning what might have been a dull, scientific treatise into a work that reads like fiction, but has the snap and style of a nonfiction feature perfectly fact-checked and copyedited in The New Yorker.    Rebecca Skloot's book will be -- has to be -- a finalist candidate for the 2010 National Book Awards, the Pulitzer Prize and the New York Times Best Non-Fiction Books. For that matter, it should win all three.    Skloot writes with the poetry of Collum Mccann, the human passion of Steinbeck and, even better, the story moves along, backwards and forwards in time, with the rush of a Stieg Larsson mystery.    Rather than replay the Story Outline button, which many on this page have done, just consider this a well-founded, from-the-heart suggestion: READ THIS BOOK!
B002HWRYJE|1.0|As I watched this film I kept thinking to myself \\"well, hold your judgment, you can let that one slide, give it a chance\\" - and I did to the bitter end. And while the film certainly had its enjoyable moments, seeing it was an entirely bittersweet affair. The opening scene promptly lost its dramatic element through its sheer ridiculousness. The attempt to rush the sorrow of George Kirk's (Jim's father) death, the happiness of Jim's birth, and the pleasantries of baby naming into a minute long conversation during a joyride into the center of the Romulan ship was in fact quite indicative of what was to come in the film, as action always took priority over good drama and plausability.<br /><br />This was a film that at its core seemed to be ashamed of what Star Trek has built, and determined to replace that monument with a slam-bam story of feverish spliced together scenes that, even when they were good, were gone too fast to use their spark to ignite the movie into something really special.<br /><br />It was not enough to see Kirk run into the bridge with his life-saving intuition, he had to have hands swelled up like the hamburger helper's and McCoy constantly giving him (strangely painful) hyposprays for comedic effect. It wasn't enough for Kirk to be chased by one ferocious snow creature when he was marooned, instead that creature had to be eaten up - Star Wars style - by a far more ridiculous creature, that, had it not been colored such a happy shade of red, would have fit right into Stephen King's \\"The Mist\\". It wasn't enough just to get Mr. Scott to the Enterprise, we had to have him fly through a bunch of water tubing just for fun, even though Simon Pegg's talent was more than adequate to forego such shallow (pun intended?) misadventures. It was not even enough to take orbital parachutes to that weapon platform to confront the Romulans, there had to be some hearty \\"Pirates\\"-style swashbuckling to finish it off.<br /><br />Rather stunning, also, was the complete irreverance to everything that Trek has established in over 40 years, despite repeatedly promises from the filmmakers to the contrary. Most notably of which was the \\"Nero screwed up the timeline so now we can do ANYTHING we want with your beloved universe\\" strategy. The most important alien planet in Star Trek is promptly eliminated, and the consequences of what should be a monumental tragedy for the Federation are highly glossed over. Engineering was turned into something resembling the basement of a 20th century wastewater facility. I half expected Scotty to be wearing a Roto-Rooter patch style patch (considering the shameless Nokia advertisement forced into the young kirk scene, it sadly may not have even been that unexpected). The phasers (both hand and ship ones) were changed from the familiar directed energy beams to \\"pew-pew-pew\\" shooters much more suited for Han Solo's belt than any ship or person in Star Trek. Even the ship itself had a more cartoonish look - it just did not look very majestic, nor did the insides of the ship match the outside well. When the shuttle doors were open it appeared the bay took up half of the entire hull. In short, the writers just didn't care very much what was previously established to fans, even if it couldn't be explained by the big-middle-finger-alternate-timeline-theory.<br /><br />Star Trek has always been praised for both spurring new scientific advances, and at least somewhat representing current theory in a palatable form. Those days are no longer. The uses of a black hole in this film were nonsensical, and laughable even to someone who's only knowledge of astronomy was gleaned from a semester of the subject in middle school. The horrendously unimaginative \\"red matter\\" was never explained, it just was magic stuff that makes black holes. (In addition to being fun and gooey!)<br /><br />The acting was not what made this film fail. It was the writing and production. Indeed, every original cast member (with maybe the exception of John Cho), did an admirable job of reprising the classic roles of their predecessors. Chris Pine lacked Shatner's dialogue style, but he had the swagger. Quinto was a more than believable Vulcan (except during the gratuitous make-out scenes with Uhura, which were stunningly out of place and character). Urban and Yelchin captured their character's vocal cadence and personalities well. Bana could have been a more engaging villain, but I fault his lack of opportunity to be tragic and evil more on the writers than his acting ability. It was worth the price of admission when I saw this in the theatre to see Leonard Nimoy as Spock again, despite the weakly concocted \\"oops I let Romulus blow up\\" story that could have, with just a little more effort, been much more intensely and believably relayed to viewers. I will give kudos for showing the inside of a mind-meld on screen, though. The effort, despite the substandard story relayed by said mindmeld, was cool.<br /><br />There was also plenty of reference to previous Treks, but more in the form of token moments than in actual film construction. There were the quizzing computers on Vulcan reminscent of Star Trek IV, the mind control bug thing from Star Trek II, the much anticipated Kobayashi Maru simulation (which in itself was would have been very satisfying if so many other scenes also didn't stretch out for cheap laughs.) The lines you expect our dear characters to say were delivered, if just to fill an obligatory requirement. This is in fact perhaps the funniest of all the Star Trek films, but Star Trek isn't a sit-com. I can laugh with everyone else, but at the end of the day, I didn't feel like I was laughing with the movie, I felt like I was laughing at it's ridiculousness.ob of reprising the classic roles of their predecessors.

B0036XN2L2|4.0|\\"Sting In The Tail\\" reflects a concerted effort by the band to go back to the \\"Blackout\\" ~ \\"Love At First Sting\\" ~ \\"Crazy World\\" period, and why not as that was the height of their popularity. It's a good record, but it's been done before and better, by this very band no less.... That said, I like the record as it is light years better than \\"Humanity Hour 1\\", which was a huge disappointment after the stellar \\"Unbreakable\\" (latter day Scorpions best CD IMO). Every band with a four decade career has its ups and downs, but for the most part the Scorpions have been very reliable and while I am partial to the \\"Taken By Force\\" ~ \\"Lovedrive\\" ~ \\"Animal Magnetism\\" era, I can really appreciate what this band is doing in today's current environment.    As for this being the end, I'm not sure I'm buying into that. It seems like a great way to drum up tour attendance figures if they hit the road. I know I'll go see them, some thirty years after I first saw them on the \\"Lovedrive\\" tour, they deserve the nod for this has been one of the best bands of a couple of generations.    *I'll append my review by stating that, after multiple listens, I really like \\"The Good Die Young\\" and \\"Turn You On\\" as standout tracks on this disc.

6300215881|5.0|I love this film, even though it might not deserve all the 5 stars I have given it. The DVD versions are (so far, up to Spring 2010) really poor transfers. Plus, it is not a movie for all tastes, because it was one of the first attempts to bring moral ambiguity, and psychological drama, to the western genre.<br /><br />The film works extremely well on two levels, but is weak in another. The central plot is that Malden betrays Brando when they were both bank robbers. Malden uses the stolen money to \\"go straight,\\" while Brando goes to prison. The clash between Brando and Malden, once Brando is out of prison, is tensely done and expertly acted. We might sympathize somewhat with Brando's character, because he is hot headed, passionate and vulnerable; but we know he is still a criminal. Despite being sheriff of Monterey, Malden's character has not changed at all. He still has a criminal mind but now wears the badge of legitimacy. There are no pure men (the women are flawed too) in this film. Their consistently wicked behavior, compared to the beautiful Monterey Peninsula setting, makes us wonder about the goodness of the human heart. This is the philosophical heart of the film and was striking even on my first viewing. The weakness of the film is the ending. It feels phony. In fact, the legend is that the ending was changed, on orders from the studio, to make it happy. I say, So What? Red River had a phony ending and it is one of the absolute classic westerns.<br /><br />The fine acting by the two co-stars is alone worth viewing this film. Add the beautiful cinematography and we have a slightly flawed yet ground breaking western. The acting is excellent. How could it be otherwise? We have here Karl Malden, Slim Pickens, and Ben Johnson. Three of the most solid actors of their generation, in addition to Marlon Brando. Watch this film and be prepared for a surprise -- Brando could direct as well as act!<br /><br />WARNING: Do not buy a DVD of this movie. All are poor in quality, because the film is now in the public domain. Even some of the VHS releases are poor.

1439190275|5.0|First, I must say this is my third Atkins book, my last being the \\"New Diet Revolution\\" published in 2002.  There are many important revisions in this one, but the largest are (1) the elimination of all the vitamin supplements replaced by one multi-vitamin, (2) the addition of \\"foundation vegetables\\" for the induction phase and (3) full menus throughout the phases to give you several weeks' choices in menu planning.  Plus, the newly revised Atkins website provides even more detailed information along with forums.    One word of warning to you gout sufferers, of whom I'm one.  There is no mention of gout in this edition.  However, the previous edition has several sentences in preventing higher uric acid levels: \\"if you have elelvated uric acid prior to going on the program you must be sure to keep your water intake up....you can also ask your physician about the drug allupurinol, which consistently lowers uric acid levels\\" (pg 112, paperback edition \\"The New Diet Revolution\\".  That said, I know from personal experience to severely limit my intake of bens--especially garbanzo beans--increase water intake and watch brocolli consumption.  Seems in my case garbanzos and brocolli are big culprits.  I also take allupurinol which is a very inexpensive prescription drug and also  lowers uric acid level.  Finally, on the Atkins website are many forums and several threads devoted to the prevention of gout o the diet.  Interestingly, itseems to occur primarily in the induction phase; once you're allowed milk, more carbohydrates the condition seems to clear.    To sum up: this is a welcome addition to the Atkins' library. COmbine this with the recipe book and you have not just a diet to lose weight, but a lifestyle that's a pleasure to follow
B002VECM4A|5.0|This is an excellent and very disturbing film.  It should be shown in Junior High and High School classrooms across the country.  In the past I have been a teacher (science, secondary school),an Eligibility Worker, and an Employment Counsellor so I am familiar with the problem of incest as well as the problem of low income, and low esteem.  This film presented all the problems in an intelligent, easy to understand, yet not condescending way.

The conditions of North Korea were somehting I had read about many times but for me the most interesting part of the book was China.<br /><br />This story is in part an expose on just how atrocious the Chinese government is towards escaping North Koreans.  When caught, these escapees are sent back to North Korea and to certain death.  A student of history will recall that the Chinese are responsible for the North Korean dictatorship, responsible for the creation of this volatile nuclear state, the gulag conditions and indirectly responsible for the death of many hundreds of thousands - maybe millions of Koreans.<br /><br />There is another, excellent viable option for China.  Send escaping North Koreans to South Korea!  It would cost the Chinese nothing and would be a great humanitarian gesture.

B00013RC8O|5.0|EXISTENTIAL CRITICISM AND THE MOVIE \\"VANISHING  POINT\\"  by Geoff Ward  There is, of course, no reason why Colin Wilson's existential criticism should not be applied to performance texts, such as those of cinema and theatre, taken as sub-divisions of literature, as well as to written ones, despite the fact that unlike a novel or a poem, they are not the products of a single author's mind but the creations of a large number of individuals, from directors, writers and actors through a whole range of technicians and other contributors.       I doubt if existential criticism has been applied to a movie before, but Richard Sarafian's Vanishing Point (1971), because of its notable existential temper, lends itself rewardingly to an application - and an illumination - of Wilson's philosophical approach.       Vanishing Point tells the story of Kowalski, a car delivery driver who, high on benzedrine, and at the wheel of a supercharged Dodge Challenger, leads police on a chase across four western US states. He's made a bet that he can make the trip from Denver to San Francisco in 15 hours. Catching Kowalski turns into a massive police operation that attracts the gaze of the national media. Through a series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Kowalski is a Vietnam war veteran with a Medal of Honor for bravery, but that his girlfriend drowned, and that his subsequent careers as a twice-promoted police officer, a motorcycle speedway rider and a stock car driver all ended in failure. After that, he was reduced to being a demolition derby driver and even an \\"auto clown\\". The movie ends with Kowalski's death as he appears to deliberately ram a roadblock.      On one level the film can be seen as a straightforward thriller (with plenty of exciting stunts and a fine contemporary music soundtrack), but on a deeper level as depicting the existential odyssey of the protagonist, whose ultimate gesture of defiance is typical of the Romantic outsider - a gesture which few indeed would be prepared to give, but one against which there can be no recourse. It is reminiscent of the Poet in Thomas Gray's The Bard who hurls himself into the abyss after cursing the royal line of Edward I. Kowalski is an anti-hero, a misfit, a solitary, defiant in the true Romantic sense that he is prepared to die rather than give in to the establishment. A laconic loner, he rejects the \\"norms\\" of both culture and counter-culture.       As an example of popular cinema, although having gained \\"cult\\" status over the years, Vanishing Point presents itself as particularly accessible to the existential critic whose first consideration is to know exactly what a book, poem or movie is saying; being  \\"true to life\\", artistically satisfying technically, or telling a story convincingly are secondary matters. Vanishing Point is also a good example of how Romanticism remains unique among artistic forces in that it retains perennial vigour and youthfulness, as well as audience appeal.      But most importantly, Vanishing Point examines how profound loss of meaning leads to a radical questioning of existence, and in so doing emphasises the corollary, that profound perception of meaning, as in the \\"peak experience\\", validates existence, and anticipates the evolutionary direction. The movie shows   what happens when the natural peak experience - achieved by Kowalski in motor racing - is lost, and an attempt is made to recapture the feeling artificially through the use of drugs and fast driving on the highway: both kinds of \\"speed\\".       It is speed that gives Kowalski a sense of release from a world he seems to see as largely meaningless, and in the latter part of the film, the blind DJ Supersoul announces that his radio station is to be re-named \\"KOWalski\\", \\"in honor of the last American hero, to whom speed means freedom of the soul\\".  Supersoul, incidentally, seems able to tap into those latent powers of the mind that Wilson describes as \\"Faculty X\\" , to use \\"intuition raised to a higher level\\" - Wilson's own definition of  Faculty X - in his (Supersoul's) apparent telepathic contact with Kowalski on at least two occasions. Ultimately, of course, Kowalski's release is shatteringly final. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, his peak experiences having forsaken him, turned to opium in greater compensatory quantities. The tragedy at the heart of Vanishing Point is that, similarly, Kowalski is unable to regain that naturally optimistic state which can lead to the peak experience.       Wilson, in The Books in my Life, during a discussion of what he describes as the \\"bird's eye view\\" of existence, as opposed to the normal \\"worm's eye view\\", says that in the former state it is as if \\"our minds cease to plod along on the level of material reality, and seem to soar up into the air. The result is an odd sense of becoming what we really are\\". Describing how he thinks Wordsworth and Van Gogh achieved this state, he then adds, suitably for this essay: \\"A racing driver probably achieves it driving at 100mph.\\"      At the moment in Vanishing Point when the media seize on Kowalski's story, there comes a telling exchange between a television reporter and Sandy, the man in charge at Argo's Car Delivery, for whom Kowalski works:      TV reporter: But as a professional driver, he never really made the grade, did he?       Sandy: Well, you know why? He never really wanted to. So far as I'm concerned, he was number one then, and he's number one now.       That Kowalski \\"never really wanted\\" to make the grade seems particularly significant. It implies a certain element of defeatism , reminding us of Wilson's concept of  \\"the age of defeat\\", set out in his book of that title which is part of his Outsider cycle. Indeed, Wilson's original introduction to The Age of Defeat is entitled \\"The Vanishing Hero\\", and in the introduction to the 2001 edition, after mentioning Shelley, Goethe and Hoffman, Wilson says: \\". . . all these romantics were overwhelmed with a sense of the authenticity oftheir `bird's eye views', even when they had to admit defeat in translating them back into terms of everyday life. This was the cause of that romantic despair that led to so many premature deaths.\\" And: \\"The vanishing hero is not simply an intellectual or literary problem. For better or worse, it is one of the consequences of this Western society . . .\\"       Heroism, in its purest definition, says Wilson, is an appetite for freedom, a desire to live more intensely. Kowalski possesses both these traits. But the realisation of heroism \\"depends upon the liveliness of the potential hero's imagination, upon how far he can understand his own latent needs, and devise an outlet for them\\".  And Kowalski seems to be one of those romantics who cannot translate his \\"bird's eye views\\" back into everyday life - hence his   penchant for fast driving on the public highway and his use of amphetamines.   As a fictional character, Kowalski at first glance may seem to represent Wilson's \\"vanishing hero\\", reflecting the negative and defeatist world in which his creators live. It is tempting even to see in the title Vanishing Point the eventual and complete cultural exit of the \\"vanishing hero\\" after a long process of literary attrition. But in actuality, in his own way, Kowalski rebels against the unheroic premise, the \\"hypothesis of insignificance\\", by setting his individuality against the system, whether it be the prevailing culture, or the counter-culture, of the time. It is supremely ironic that, ultimately, he decides to pay for this stance with his life.       But as Wilson points out, the authors of 19th and 20th century literature had no qualms about loading the dice against their heroes and heroines. In a sense, the character of Kowalski is related to this literary \\"tradition\\", yet his moral perception indicates that he is in no way merely defeatist, but that, true to romantic type, he is unwilling to play by the established rules, to perform what (any) society expects of him.For example, he stands out against police corruption, to his own personal cost; he checks to ensure that drivers he outruns are not injured in various road accidents, risking capture as he does so; he takes only the amount of \\"bennies\\" he needs, despite being offered more; he resists the offer of casual sex from the girl on the motorcycle.      The questioning of existence which pervades the theme of Vanishing Point is symbolised during an aerial shot in which we see Kowalski's car tracks create a giant \\"X\\" in the desert sand of Death Valley. Primarily, \\"X\\" indicates the Unknown. It is the ultimate \\"sliding signifier\\", equating anything with nothing, and it is under the shadow of  \\"X\\" that Kowalski moves, all the way from \\"point zero\\" to \\"vanishing point\\". The narrative of the movie is all about crossings - X-ings - literally, as Kowalski crosses the central reservation, the railroad line, the state lines, No Name Creek;  figuratively, as he \\"crosses the line\\" between what the authorities/establishment will and will not tolerate, especially as he \\"crosses\\" the police, appropriately driving a Dodge Challenger, dodging the cops and challenging the system. Kowalski also crosses the line between optimism of the past and pessimism of the present, and ultimately, the point of no return at Cisco, where he becomes resigned to his doom, his own personal \\"vanishing point\\".      All this is underpinned by an ironic sub-text, comprising some 40 captions including road and other signs, ads, graffiti and newspaper headlines, which runs throughout the movie. A telling contrast of focalisation is created between this sub-text and the main narrative which is shifted, in a balance of opposites, towards placing emphasis on terms not normally given precedence in Western culture, destabilising or subverting the traditional hierarchy, thus:  law-breaking over law-enforcement; defiance over compliance; non-conformity over conformity; speed over caution. Much of the sub-text attempts to weight the balance the other way in a contrapuntal sequence which continually warns of the precariousness and danger of what Kowalski is doing. For example, the road sign \\"Stop\\" appears prominently no less than ten times; \\"End speed zone\\" suggests an anti-drugs message as well as giving a wry commentary on a police chase. Ironical comment is a key function of the sub-text; for example, a police roadblock is shown clustered around a sign saying \\"Welcome to California\\".      Yet the sub-text also indicates the synchronic values which Kowalski appears to be rejecting in American society by force of his own individuality, repressive aspects of society which the Romantic seeks to shake off , eg, \\"Coca Cola\\", \\"Mobil\\" (big business, materialism), police insignia (the establishment, authority), \\"Jesus Saves\\" (religion, dogma), \\"Love\\" (the counter-culture). The juxtaposition of these static images against those of the fast-moving action demands the active interpretative engagement of the viewer who is called upon to make the imaginative connections. Meanwhile, Kowalski himself seems to evade the signifying system. Argo's Car Delivery alludes to the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, the crew of the ship Argo who sailed in search of the Golden Fleece, and who had various adventures along the way, and obstacles to overcome, just as Kowalski does. But if the Dodge is Kowalski's Argo, en route (via the \\"Drug Center\\") to the Golden State, he finds no equivalent of the Golden Fleece, only X-the-Unknown, and oblivion, beyond his crossing point between life and death.      The movie's title is, of course, crucial, and functions on a number of different levels simultaneously:  1. The point where the sides of a highway converge at the horizon through the action of perspective - the point towards which Kowalski is always and inevitably heading; where the sightlines converge, itself an illusion.  2. The point at which Kowalski ceases to be a person and becomes a symbol - hero or villain, depending upon viewpoint - created by the DJ Supersoul.  3. The \\"vanishing point\\" of any stable or ultimate meaning.  4. The point at which Kowalski \\"deconstructs\\" himself in a deliberate act of self-immolation - the suicide crash; the point at which he vanishes from the world.       At the beginning of the movie, in a kind of \\"flash-forward\\", after we see Kowalski drive out of the symbolic \\"graveyard\\" of rusting hulks of old vehicles and head back towards Cisco on the Sunday morning, the Challenger and a black Chrysler pass each other on a stretch of road; the scene freezes and the Dodge disappears. This may represent Kowalski's point of no return, his own last ride and \\"vanishing point\\". As the action then proceeds analeptically from the Friday night, Kowalski is shown delivering the black car in Denver.       So, then, how does Vanishing Point score with Wilson's existential critic? The answer is, I think, quite highly. The movie does attempt to get beyond the values and limits of the \\"natural standpoint\\", and to investigate the question of existence itself - what human existence is for - through the character of Kowalski whose actions, past and present, seek an intensity or fullness of experience, but which are acutely contrasted with the content of the sub-text, representing the restrictive forces operating against him. In this way, one may assert that the film is successful in revealing existence as potentiality.       At the same time, however, it raises the spectre of what Thomas Hardy called the \\"Immanent Will\\" (what today, less grandly, we would call \\"Murphy's Law\\"), that impersonal and unconscious purpose which works itself out through history and is indifferent to the welfare of humanity in its thwarting of aspiration, revealing the disparity between the possible (the desired) and the actual (what the Immanent Will wills) - bringing in the inevitable element of pessimism, or defeatism, one of the \\"consequences of Western society\\", which   Wilsonian criticism detects as endemic in the literature of the 19th and 20th centuries. That an evolutionary expansion of consciousness should be able to \\"inform\\" the Immanent Will, so to speak, and thereby gradually overthrow the defeatist attitude, the \\"fallacy of insignificance\\", is implicit in Wilson's philosophy of the new existentialism.      At the end of the movie, the chorus of the gospel-influenced Kim Carnes song Nobody knows is repeated several times as the camera tracks away from the crash site to a panorama of desert and sky. It seems to be saying that it takes death to make us see the actual potential of life, of existence - as does the Dr Johnson quotation to which Wilson is fond of referring: \\"When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully.\\" But we always slip back into everyday consciousness (which Wilson, in a famous phrase, maintains is a liar) and let the \\"robot\\" take over so many aspects of our lives, drawing a veil over that potential.       Kowalski, who decides that he will not return to the \\"robotic\\" life, takes an escape route which his pursuers cannot follow and, in the words of Nobody knows, his \\"soul goes free\\", suggesting a kind of metaphysical victory over the world. This, of course, cannot be valorised in existential terms, but it is nevertheless the impression created by combining the film's concluding images with this particular song. As a whole, however, the movie depicts graphically how the realisation of human potential, and the validation of human purpose, are frustrated not only by the very institutions which we create, but also by the very way we think, as the American psychologist George Pransky, much lauded by Wilson recently, has pointed out. One could say that Kowalski sacrifices himself in order to bring this powerfully to our attention.  * Regrettably, the 1997 made-for-TV remake of Vanishing Point is devoid of existential quality and the context of \\"outsiderism\\". Displaying the lamentably inevitable 1990s political correctness, this version has Kowalski's long-distance delivery of a vintage Dodge Challenger (identical to the one in the original film) go haywire when his expectant wife is suddenly hospitalised in danger of losing their unborn child. Mistakenly vilified, a desperate Kowalski eludes the FBI and police of four states as he races to cover 1,200 miles separating him from his family).

B0036B8MXC|5.0|As a major fan for years of epic, period, historical movies and series such as ROME, (I'm the #1 fan I do believe), SPARTACUS is raw, gritty, and delivers powerfully, a very close portrayal of what it was like in ancient Roman times as a slave and Gladiator. The Romans killed for gain, power, wealth, and their slaves were like furniture, and they were discarded as if they were nothing. Since the ROME series, 300, Gladiator, and others, when I first saw Spartacus, I told friends that it was a cross between those 3 movies. It is for sure, and I was hoping that Spartacus lived up to that expectation, with a new kind of style also.<br /><br />Spartacus was betrayed by the Roman General Glaber, and sold in to slavery to Batiatus to train at his Ludus Gladiatorus, which was the gladiator school in Capua, Italy. On the first episode I was not sure, but I am hooked now and am totally sold on the series, especially because of Andy Whitfield's performance. (he has a striking resemblance to a close family member,which really freaks me out but in a good way). I think Andy Whitfield will enjoy many years to come in the movies! I am rooting for him to break free from Batiatus and Lucretia, and his emprisonment there.<br />John Hannah, a old favorite from The Mummy series, is great as Batiatus, whose family owned that Ludus for many generations. He plays his part to the hilt and it blows me away, seeing a side of John Hannah I have never seen before. I think he is superb in this by being the ultimate tyrannt of his house and school. I have known about Lucy Lawless but have never watched her before. She and the rest of the cast do round it all out very well. There is some amazing talent in this series!<br /><br />I find myself looking forward to each Friday to find out what happens next.

B000MCH5P4|5.0|An ominous shot in the Moroccan hinterlands echoes in a Mexican village, cracks across Tokyo`s metallic skyline.  Are the consequences of our actions so interconnected, so inextricable from one another?  According to Alejandro Inarritu`s masterful creation, `Babel,` the answer is yes.    Few plots are as labyrinthine as `Babel`s,` and even fewer manage to remain as comprehensible and engaging as this one.  An impoverished Moroccan family of goat herders barters for a new hunting rifle to help protect their flocks.  The herder`s sons taunt each other into ever greater feats of marksmanship when a fateful target looms into view:  a tourist bus lumbering up a mountain highway.  His turn to trump his brother`s paltry aim, the younger son pulls the trigger and soon sets off an avalanche of unforeseen consequences.    The stray bullet finds home in an embittered American housewife (Cate Blanchett), angered and confused as to why she and her husband (Brad Pitt) are sweating things out in such a desolate destination.  The renegade shot stops such musing short as she slowly bleeds out and her husband`s increasingly ugly American behavior takes over.  An American shot in an Islamic backwater...it must be `terrorists.`    As the bus veers into a nearby village for medical assistance, the shot sounds an echo heard worlds away.  Tokyo police search out the original owner of the rifle, while the American couple`s children back in Southern California are shuffled off to their Mexican housekeeper`s (Adriana Barraza) Baja village for her son`s wedding.  Sound convoluted? Preposterous? Unlikely in the extreme?  As Innaritu`s skilled direction weaves the storyline ever deeper, your disbelief becomes thoroughly suspended as the improbable, the impossible comes to life.    As Tokyo`s police track down the gun`s owner, his deaf-mute daughter (Rinko Kikuchi in a truly heart-wrenching debut performance) unloads a Pandora`s box of hidden pain.  Deprived a mother by suicide, Kikuchi`s character is adrift in a world that neither understands her nor she it.  The film shows that even when words are clear and intelligible, they rarely mirror the truth of our desires and needs.  Kikuchi`s character is a pathetic case in point.  Treated as an outcast by the speaking world around her, her hunger for human connection intensifies.  She screams for contact, yet nobody listens.  She finally resorts to the only language left her, her physical body, to convey her loneliness and hunger for connection.  Yet, those confronted by her glaring behavior and physical directness miss the deeper message.  Signals are misread, and meanings get lost in translation.  She, like all the film`s characters, gets lost in a babel of words bereft their true message.    Innaritu`s film shows a human community stumbling ever further away from comprehension, from connection.  Botched transmissions and fumbled receptions clutter each frame. Lies overlap lies until words are but empty vessels, stripped of content.  In the village where Pitt`s character scurries helplessly, English-language television networks ramble on about `terrorist cells` and an `American tourist killed` (she survives).  When the Moroccan gendarmes descend upon the goat herder's family, misinformation swarms like flies.  The police thugs beat up those whose `answers` make no sense.  As the housekeeper returns from Mexico with her American charges, her nephew (the fiery Gael Garcia Bernal) engages in a verbal cat-and-mouse game with the border guards until chaos overcomes.  The housekeeper, with her limited English, is unable to clarify an otherwise straightforward situation.  Confusion spreads like a cancer and the consequences approach the catastrophic.    Despite the cacophony of voice and miscue, `Babel` does not descend into absolute despair.  Innaritu does offer hope that understanding is still possible.  The children of this film carry its redemption.  Throughout the film, they knowingly and unknowingly set rightthe confusions adults sow.  The housekeeper talks to her American ninos in Spanish and they passively, instinctively comprehend.  In the Moroccan village, while parents and police turn to violence, the youngest son (Mohamed Akhzam in an amazing performance) ends the mayhem by divulging the truth the adults have failed to grasp.    `Babel` ends painfully, tragically.  A boy chocks the wheel of violence but not without a horrible price.  A housekeeper saves her charges but loses her freedom.  A lonely girl threatens suicide.  What makes these moments all the more pathetic is that they could have been avoided.  Innaritu suggests our babel of tongues, customs, and walls deny us the chance of celebrating our common humanness.  The best we can hope for is support from those closest to us, namely our own flesh and blood.  The muted, misunderstood teen clings to her father, the hapless American tourists realize their children hold the keys to contentment, the deported housekeeper finds refuge in her son`s arms, and the Moroccan father grieves a murdered son, saved perhaps an even worse fate.    While Innaritu`s political subtext may grate some viewers the wrong way (Are American lives worth more?), don`t let that scare you away from a provocative, thoughtful and emotionally enriching experience.  While the big names (Pitt and Blanchett) fill the film`s minor roles, it is the unknowns and child actors who deliver `Babel`s` masterful performances.  `Babel` celebrates those outside the Hollywood pale...the Bernals... the Barazas... the Kikuchis... the Akhzams.  Combined with Gustavo Santaolalla`s evocative soundtrack (a great follow up to his Brokeback Mountain work) and Rodriego Prieto`s lush, encompassing panoramas of Sahel scrabble and Tokyo steel, their all too human portrayals make `Babel` a film for the ages.
0345477618|5.0|\\"Making Of\\" was written a few years ago by J.W. Rinzler. He was able to comb the Lucasfilm archives and unearth dozens of interviews that were conducted contemporaneously with the making of the original film. This, along with tons of production artwork, photographs, and behind the scenes materials are what comprise the book. It was both a difficult read, and an easy read. After reading the introduction by Peter Jackson, I plowed straight in to the book. It's not a terribly long book (around 300 pages), but it a big book - thick and unwieldy - printed in an almost sadistically small font. It's also printed on heavy stock paper, with just enough gloss to make it challenging if lighting conditions aren't ideal. There - that's the bad - all physical issues with the book itself. Now on to the good.    As a fan, I pride myself on knowing a decent amount of Star Wars trivia and folklore. Still, I was amazed at the things I learned in the book. It's been 33 years since the original film came out. I, like some many others, have grown up with the Star Wars mythos as part of the fabric of my life - it's easy to take for granted. For most of us, we don't really remember a world without Star Wars. (I'm also happy to say that I've passed my love of \\"Star Wars\\" done to both of my kids.) With that perspective, I found it fascinating to Lucas struggle to pull this new world together. You get to follow that evolution through four different versions of the script, and ultimately to what we all know and love from the film itself. You can see Lucas as he struggles to meld the ideas that he has, refine them down., and deliver a true \\"modern fairy tale\\". You also see his unyielding self criticism, and unhappiness with how the movie eventually turned out. It's easy to understand why he revisited the films in 1997 to \\"fix\\" them, and try to put on the screen the story he always wanted to (except for the Greedo incident - there he should have left well enough alone - Han ALWAYS shoots first.End of story).    Along with the evolution of the script, you get a good look at what it took to start a special effects company from scratch (ILM), and get a movie that no one believed in, made in the late 70's. There were many stories I had heard before - Luke Skywalker was originally called Luke Starkiller; and many that I had not heard - he was called Starkiller up until just shortly after principle photography had started. Lucas felt, with the Manson murders in the news, that Starkiller might not play well. They hadn't yet filmed the scene where Luke introduces himself to Leia in the Death Star prison cell, so the change was made.    If you are a \\"Star Wars\\" fan, or just a fan of movies, you should read this book. I am giving it five stars. I almost gave it four stars because it was so physically frustrating to read but, in the end, I just enjoyed it too much. \\"Star Wars\\" was a seminal event in film history, and I loved to get a look behind the scenes of how it came to be. Rinzler is publishing a definitive history of the making of \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" - due out this summer. I've already got it in my shopping basket on Amazon.
0307454541|4.0|The first bit of the book is hard to get thru but is worth the work. Once you get past that, the book turns out really good.

Lisbeth is tough as nail, sharp as a tack and as dangerous as a cornered snake.
0061537969|5.0|Very real life and balanced perspective on how a family tragedy can lead to such awful behavior...and yet the character perseveres.  NOt a terribly introspective book.  The reader provides most of that.  The author leads you along.  You provide your own emotion.
0143170104|5.0|Oh wow, was this book ever good! After becoming heavily invested in the characters after reading the first in the series, this book took me to new emotional heights. I held my breath and read as fast as I could up until the last sentence. Then, went I read the last word, I actually shouted out loud. I am waiting on pins and needles for the last book in the series to come out.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|I LOVE this movie! It's fresh, fun, and clean with gorgeous music that all romantics will love. What a delightful movie to watch, and the kids can too! Katie Holmes is adorable as the nation's First Daughter in her first semester at college, and Marc Blucas is dashing and debonair as her fellow student/boyfriend/undercover Secret Service agent. The supporting actors are excellent, and add excellent depth to the movie. If you're looking for a clean, amusing \\"chick flick\\", I completely recommend it. Wish that Marc starred in more leading man roles like this!!
B002RAREAK|5.0|This is definitely a great album from Usher. Though it isn't as great as Confessions, I think it's up there and serves it's purpose well.
1568493541|5.0|When you pick up a Vonnegut novel, it's so easy to breeze through it that you tend to underestimate the complexity of the ideas that are presented. Vonnegut has a gift for making plain, declarative statements that are seemingly simple, but which help you see the world in all its absurdity.     In \\"Breakfast of Champions,\\" Vonnegut shows his mastery of this technique. About guns: \\"Sometimes people would put holes in famous people so they could be at least fairly famous, too.\\"  About speech: \\"Most white people in Midland City were insecure when they spoke, so they kept their sentences short and their words simple in order to keep embarrassing mistakes to a minimum.\\"  About our economic system: \\"The planet was being destroyed by manufacturing processes, and what was being manufactured was lousy, by and large.\\"  And so on.    These witticisms or social comments, or whatever you want to call them, are strung throughout a book that moves at a frenetic pace. Ostensibly, it follows the converging paths of obscure novelist Kilgore Trout and insane businessman Dwayne Hoover. As Trout travels to Hoover's town, Midland City, we learn about Trout's negative philosophy of life through the plots of his novels, which inevitably end with the only innocent or good character or positive human creation being senselessly killed. Hoover, meanwhile, is a success in our real-world sense, and he even has some good personal traits (such as hiring African American workers when others wouldn't). But he has lost his grip on reality after his wife committed suicide, and he is questioning the value of living. Near the end, Trout and Hoover collide, and harm ensues for several people -- though those events also set of a chain reaction that the narrator tells us will eventually lead to worldwide fame for Trout and his negative philosophy.    Nonetheless, plot isn't as important as the observations that the narrator and the characters in the novel toss continuously.  While you're chuckling at the statments, you're also re-evaluating how you see the world. Things really are bad in a lot of ways, and it takes either blindness or an absurdist sense of humor to come to grips with it.  Vonnegut is shaking us up by showing the absurdity in all its vividness.      The most remarkable thing about the book, from my perspective, is that it was published in 1973, but it feels fully relevant today.  Some of the comments about environmental pollution, war-mongering, bland consumerism, latent racism, random violence, etc., seem as if they could have been written in a blog this week.  The issues were on the cusp of common consciousness in the early 70s when Vonnegut wrote \\"Breakfast,\\" but he saw them clearly at the time, and he sent out a warning. Too bad it hasn't been heeded.
B001E3E1J8|3.0|I bought the book cause I love the movie adaptation. Its funny normally the book has so much more than the film but in this case the movie in my opinion was so much better than the book.  The book is set in the 50's, its very clean The book was nice very clean dated in the 50's so I suppose it has to be but I didn't feel the chemistry between the two main characters so I was really disappointed.
B002VECMAE|5.0|The jedi jokes are only the beginning of this wild ride of a film.  I'd send anyone on this trip through the mental desert of psi warfare.  I am still chuckling over some of the lines, and the acting is top notch.  Some folks may not get all the humor, but if you remember any of the first or second Star Wars movies, you'll enjoy this film.  Any truth to it?  Who knows exactly how much, but even without the 'true story' factor, 'goats' stands on it's own.
B0034JKZ3G|4.0|Disney has proven that 2D is far from outdated but is instead a distinct and equally dignified artistic medium of animation as Pixar and Dreamworks's 3D. The Princess and the Frog tells a succinct and cute story who's charming simplicity is reminiscent of the good old days of earlier Disney films. The visuals are hands down DAZZLING; joyful explosions of color but all with a very unique aesthetic that avoid being psychadelic. At the same time the story remains fun, compelling, and at times wonderfully poetic without being sappy. And the characters are some of the most uniquely lovable and memorable I've seen in years.
B0036CWK8O|5.0|I was not sure what to expect from this album.  It is conceptual and very unique to be sure.  Personally, I like it very much.  I have been a die hard Helloween fan for over 20 years, and I would suggest this album to any fan who feels the same.<br /><br />This album is not hard rock, It is soft rock/jazz/classical remake of previous songs.  The obvious pinnacle of this album is the keeper trilogy with an 80 piece orchestra and chamber chior.  It is the most fascinating 17 minutes of music I have heard to date from any band.<br /><br />All things considered I am very happy with this album and as always, cannot wait until they release their next album
1406325635|4.0|This book was a pretty good read, but it was predictable overall and more of a little kid book than I thought it would be. However, the book included several twists that I thought were interesting, and you didnt really want to put it down. I would definitely recommend this book for pre-teen audiences.
1416550550|5.0|This was a page turner and I loved the mystery, setting and the garden!  It came recommended to me by a friend as a great read and that was the truth.  Highly recommend.
B000002UHG|3.0|A conceptual sound scape in the maudlin key of melancholia. At best it bears comparison with Robert Wyatt[[ASIN:B000VFGQDE Comicopera]][[ASIN:B000006AXS Rock Bottom]]but at times it falls into the trajectory Floyd took after Dark Side of the Moon. Sinéad O'Connor's vocal contributions make the whole tribulation worthwhile. And thats something to entice further listening.
B0000549B2|4.0|Anything with Denzel in it is worth owning he is a great actor and sssooo cute
0790744759|4.0|I liked this movie but that song is the main reason i bought the movie, Judy is great,
B000002H2H|5.0|A departure from KILL EM' ALL, this album gets more complex, musically and lyrically. The material takes a more mature tone, dealing with themes such as fear, unjust punishment, (suicide?) no... getting your gear stolen before a show, rebellion, nuclear warfare and even one based on a historical event. There is an instrumental based on Lovecrafts' Call of Cthulhu. Mustaines' influence is found on this album, but not as strongly as on their previous record. Metallica's first ballad appears here and the album is isn't all thrash. It takes a more melodic and thoughtful turn at times, moreso than before,  and Kirk Hammets' background in classical guitar begins to shine through. The jewel of the album is of course CREEPING DEATH, a track originating when the late Cliff Burton made a comment while watching The Ten Commandments, \\"It's like creeping death!\\" during the lambs blood painted door scene. This album is a must have and only hints at what was to come next!<br /><br />A lock - 5 out of 5 stars.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm not the type of person to do an at home workout.  I like to go to the gym  to get a full workout of cardio and strength training.  In the last year  I have let myself go and I am having a hard time getting back in to shape.  After reading reviews I decided to buy this video.  I just completed my first  workout and I am feeling great.  I finished level one and it was quite difficult.  I wasn't bored.  I can see myself doing this workout for at least a month and then  alternating with other cardio.  I also purchased her yoga video and will try it later  today or tomorrow.  Can't wait!
0756405890|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss's the Name of the Wind, the first book of his the Kingkiller Chronicle, is one of the most remarkable debut novels I have ever read. The Name of the Wind succeeds on multiple fronts: it features a compelling protagonist whose development as a character is truly remarkable; it features a solid, intriguing plot; it is superbly written from a technical standpoint.    The protagonist, the titular \\"Kingkiller\\", Kvothe, is a famous magician, musician and adventure. By his mid-20s, the age at which we are first introduced to him, Kvothe is a legend, more myth than man. Although Kvothe can, at times, be a little too perfect (what I mean is that he is typically exceptionally good at just about everything he tries), he is also extremely human. He makes mistakes, acknowledges them and learns from them. He has grown bitter and disenchanted with himself and his world. He has faults, namely pride, which conspire to cause him tremendous harm.    Indeed, the plot of the Name of the Wind is almost exclusively character development. The story is Kvothe's. It is his autobiography, dictated in hopes of allaying all the myths and legends that have surrounded him. In other words, Kvothe wants to get the record straight. In doing so, the character does not seek self-aggrandizement, but rather humanization. He explains away the myths that make him seem larger than life (the myth that he is, for example, bloodless, was actually based on his taking a drug which stopped bleeding prior to being publicly whipped). It is fascinating and, indeed, a nice break from normal fantasy writing, to see a character who has accomplished so much explain it in such human terms.    That is, I think, what is so superlative about the Name of the Wind. Rothfuss manages to create a greater than life, exceptionally powerful, brilliant and talented man, and make him human, bringing him down to the level of the reader. Rothfuss makes us care for Kvothe almost immediately and, indeed, very fiercely.As a reader, I tend to prefer limited but well explained magic systems. Of course, I prefer not to have magic at all. But failing that, I prefer that the system not merely be some vague wave of magic (a la Steven Erikson's Gardens of the Moon), but rather thoroughly explained. Although not as detailed as Brandon Sanderson's allomancy in his Mistborn trilogy, Rothfuss's magic system is well explained and realized. The well explained magic system lends an air of realism to the Name of the Wind.    But my favorite part of the Name of the Wind is the technical writing. As a long time fan of the fantasy genre, I have accepted that most fantasy novels are not particularly well written. I love the plot, I love the characters, I love the mythologies. But the writing itself? Typically, the best we can hope for is adequate writing. But Rothfuss is a stellar writer, from a technical standpoint. Kvothe is, as much as anything else, a dramatist. Writing from Kvothe's perspective, Rothfuss writes an elegant, dramatic prose that manages, at the same time, to avoid coming off as overly dramatic. Some of the descriptive turns of phrase Rothfuss employs are downright beautiful and artistic.    All that being said, no novel is perfect. Because of the Name of the Wind's focus on Kvothe, very few other characters are well drawn out. Of course, this makes sense given the perspective from which it is written. But a stronger or deeper cast of characters would only strengthen the novel overall. Also, although Rothfuss's prose is very strong, his dialogue is, in some cases, somewhat unrealistic. The instances are few and far between, but there are a couple passages where the reader might find it hard to imagine that someone would actually speak like that.    In sum, the Name of the Wind is one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read and, indeed, one of the best novels I have ever read. It is certainly one of the most impressive debut novels I have ever read. But Rothfuss has set thebar very high for himself. The second novel in the series, the Wise Man's Fear, is already well overdue and, with luck, will be released early 2011. My expectations are through the roof for the rest of the series and, coupled with the wait increasing my interest, I hope Rothfuss does not disappoint. But even if the rest of the series were to turn out to be an abject failure, I would strongly urge anyone to read the Name of the Wind.     In my opinion, very few novels warrant a 5 star rating. The Name of the Wind definitely deserves it.
0307704513|5.0|I've been closely following Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson of 37Signals since 2004.  Their well-written collection of essays in REWORK distills their philosophy on business into one great little book (or in this case, a 3-CD audiobook).  This thing's packed tight with thought-provoking wisdom.  I recommend it enthusiastically.  I can't wait for the sequel, RE-REWORK ;-)
B000002H33|5.0|where does one even begin? this third installment of the metallica legacy is a MASTERPIECE. i never use that term lightly. if popular opinion doesn't convince you then just listen for yourself. the album opens with some ominous acoustics, and then the hammer of justice is brought forth in judgement of the rest of the metal world. this album is sleek and dangerous, heavy and brooding, intelligent and far superior to almost anything out there even now. if i have to make a comparison, the only other record that even comes close to this metal heads' wet dream would be REIGN IN BLOOD. the great CLIFF BURTON shines here, the bass more prominent than ever before, kirk outdoes himself and is simply unleashed and lends his diverse musical background perfectly. lars is always lars and james is just super pissed, barking and snarling and setting the tone as always. the lyrics are mature and fresh. we experience what it feels like to be a living force, we explore cocaine addiction, more of LOVECRAFTS' monsters and an insane asylum. we cast out false religion and die as soldiers, experience the surreal of space through an instrumental and learn who to call if we feel the need to destroy. this is a supernova of metal, a guide for the lost and the emperor on the throne. i believe this can never be duplicated. and MUSTAINE had nothing to do with it....    throw as many stars as you like and i'll fill em all up.    but for now, 5 out of 5.
B00361HV02|4.0|Great new album from BRMC...raw, energetic, rocking...with some touches of Howl here and there...gets better with every listen.
0141003960|4.0|It seems to be David Crystal's trademark, books that are both academic, full of information, and fun to read. This book is not an exception. Highly recommended.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I would advise getting the Attenborough version.  Do you remember how bad the Sigourney Weaver narration of \\"Planet Earth\\" was?  Attenborough was much better.  Don't waste your money on the Oprah version of \\"Life\\".  I've watched the Winfrey version currently on Discovery...I wished I hadn't.  Oprah should stick with daytime tv.  She doesn't have the voice for this type of work.<br /><br />Thank goodness the Attenborough version will be available on June 1, 2010!<br /><br />It's too bad there isn't a zero star rating....
0060853972|4.0|Crazy, crazy, crazy book.  I was reminded of reading Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy while I was reading Good Omens (and felt the same way I did with Hitchhiker's as well.. as if about 90% of the book was just flying over my head).<br /><br />It was crazy in a very fun way though.  I chortled and laughed dozens and dozens of times. I found myself scratching my head and re-reading certain paragraphs again and again, and at times I felt my eyes cross because there was just  so much  happening.<br /><br />I loved the portrayal of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse.  Famine was especially my favorite, I think mostly because I can see something like that happening today! It's not at all far from where we are as a society.<br /><br />The one thing that confused me the most was, for having Agnes Nutter in the title, there really wasn't all that much having to do with her prophesies.  I did enjoy them when they showed up, it just didn't seem like a central part of the book.<br /><br />But that aside, I did enjoy it.  I actually ended up purchasing a copy because I knew, just like Hitchhiker's, it would be a book I'd need to re-read again and again to \\"get\\".
B00158K0S8|5.0|After viewing this film for almost 40 years on television, and all the viewing limitations that entails, it was refreshing to see the whole picture finally.
038073186X|4.0|I love Lehane's stories, but his writing isn't quite my favorite. He's kind of \\"Grisholm-esque........a better story teller than writer. It really clarified the movie's ending for me, which is why I wanted to read it. Like an idiot, I saw the movie FIRST!
B001P4ESFS|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this show. Season one was awesome, and I didn't know if season two could compete, but it did! And it added to all of the characters, while telling a compelling story line. Plus, this is one show I enjoy watching over and over, to get all the small clues. Season three is panning out to be pretty d-mn good too.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|Well I guess I will Wait on this one because the next one comng in may is gonna be in 3D and it will have all the extra footage and content
0553573403|5.0|I will spare the details as there are plenty in prev. reviews. I will add that IMO this is the only book in the series that I would let my 13 year old daughter read with minimal hesitation (if she wanted). The violence and sexuality is toned down compared to the later books. Seems his editors began catering to the greater reading demographic in books 2,3,4.<br /><br />Personally I loved it. GRR.Martin is a genius.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started this workout dvd a little over a month ago.  My goal was to lose about 10-15 pounds and tone up. I am about 5'2\\" and 136 pounds. Before this, I hadn't exercised in years.  When I first started this dvd I couldn't hardly do it and my legs hurt so bad I literally couldn't hardly walk on them.  This dvd really works your body!      After the 30 days, I have only lost three pounds, but I have definite muscle in my legs and arms.  My butt has gotten tighter and smaller, and my pants are looser.  I am going to stick with it everyday and hopefully make my goal!  It is very hard at first, but stick with it, every day it gets easier.
B00009V7P8|5.0|It was not too many years ago when this album did not leave my CD player for at least ten months. Even now, years later, I am strongly considering doing much the same thing for another ten months. Each and every song on this album is wonderful in its own right, and yet possess that same pleasantly haunting underscore which makes me want to close my eyes at one point or another. Damien Rice has created a sound that is just enough unlike anything I have ever heard to make it timeless in my book. O, in its entirety, is one of the best examples of true music that has been created within the last ten years.
B000002JSJ|5.0|1976's PRESENCE by Led Zeppelin was recorded right after the huge success of Physical Graffiti, and its sound is in total contrast to that album. I think that it's a good thing, though. What I appreciate about this album is its simplicity. It consists of Jimmy's guitar, John Baldwin's bass, and John Bonham's intense drumming. Bonham shines on this album, especially on ACHILLE'S LAST STAND. I really dig his fills on that song, and the rest of the album, for that matter. PRESENCE had the misfortune to be released in the same year as THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME (live album), which affected sales. However, we're talking about Led Zeppelin here, and everything they've touched has turned into gold, eventually. It took many years for the critics and the public to get on board Zeppelin III, and that album is considered a fine work, and a classic. PRESENCE is blues-oriented, and has their roots embedded for the 7 tracks. This was an important release, because it is considered to be the album that kept the band together after Plant's accident in 1975, and as it turns out, the last album until 1979's IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR, which followed tragic events in Plant's life, and the resulting time off. I like the whole album, especially TEA FOR ONE, ACHILLE'S LAST STAND, FOR YOUR LIFE, and ROYAL ORLEANS. Overall, PRESENCE is a good album. Sometimes something that's thrown together can be better than something that's carefully planned. This was a great effort under extenuating circumstances. 9.5/10
B0020MMBL2|4.0|I had to keep in mind throughout the book that this was Cecilia Ahern's first novel, she wrote it at 21, and she never really intended for it to become a book in the first place. I preface with that because while the writing was moving and touching in all the right places, at times, I felt it was a bit undeveloped and \\"tell-y.\\" Some of the timelines moved forward a little too quickly as well.    Holly Kennedy is bereft with grief and doesn't know quite how to put her life back together after her husband Gerry dies. Holly is only 30 and has her whole life ahead of her, and yet she doesn't want to continue living. But when she discovers a series of notes from Gerry meant to help her move out of her grief and back into the real world, she begins looking forward to living again.    Each month, she sweetly waits until midnight of the new month, opens the note, and cherishes each word. It's a way of holding onto Gerry for just a little while longer. As readers, we discover that Gerry is slowly letting go of Holly just as Holly needs to let go of him.    What I loved most about this book was Ahern's ability to touch on the emotion of grief so significantly. Most of the books I read have happy endings. I look forward to that. But Holly also found a happy ending even if it wasn't the way she anticipated. Ahern explored the effect grief has on friendships, family relationships, and even new love. She left no stone unturned, and for a first-time writer, she succeeded brilliantly.
B002VECM72|5.0|Michael Lewis is my favorite writer. I have read all his books from Liar's Poker in 1989 to The New New Thing in 2000 to Moneyball in 2003, The Blind Side in 2006 and Panic in 2008.<br />I have seen many of Sandra Bullock's movies, including her breakthrough film Speed in 1994 and Crash in 2006. Her acting in the 2009 film The Blind Side is the best of her career and she was rightly awarded a 2010 Oscar as Best Actress.<br />This is only the fourth film that John Lee Hancock has directed. He avoids all the cliches that could have sunk this movie by being faithful to a real life portrayal of the leading characters.<br />Don't miss the special features found in the blu-ray edition, which are some of the best I have seen.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|This one has very much a James Bond feel to it, in that the plot twists and turns, the hero travels around the world seeking villains and has lots of cool gadgets to play with.    His head of R&D is 'M' .. there is Moneypenny and the head of the CIA. Not sure which character Michael Caine plays though.    The biggest give away is the capture of the international money launderer .. it starts with James (er, sorry Bruce), on a yacht with a bunch of beautiful women, and ends with a skylift from the top of a tall building.     Unlike your typical JB movie, which stretches the boundaries of believableness (is that a word?), this breaks those boundaries and turns into a true fantasy, where our hero has almost no limits to what he can do .. but that's ok, because our villain also has no limits to his ruthlessness (that is a word), being able to set bombs off at will anywhere in the city he pleases, without anyone having the slightest inkling that those barrels will explode if ignited.     The movie makes you concentrate in order to follow the plot, which others have pointed is flawed in so many places, but then so are the plots of most JB movies. My biggest gripe is reserved for the last scene, where 2 ferries are battling it out to see which will crack first to blow up the other. It's just silly. Even if one person cracked, they would be responsible for the deaths of 100's of people and almost certainly sentenced to the death penalty, so Mr. Joker .. your game is flawed from the start. Not only that, but why would a ferry that is capable carrying several hundred people be full of convicts? I could not imagine it possible to leave several tons of explosives on any public ferry in the world without someone asking the question .. 'er, anyone know why our hold is full of explosive barrels?' Oh yes, and throwing what looks like a home-made (unstable) detonating device out of a porthole into the water .. what are the chances that is going to cause the detonator to go off (Or was that the point, and I missed it?)    In summary .. if you like fast-moving thinking JB movies, and taking the stunts and fantasy to an extreme does not bother you, this movie is great. Just try to ignore the many obvious flaws in the storyline.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I love Lenny Kravitz's voice and he is an extremely talented songwriter as well. This CD has all of his greatest songs and I love almost all of the songs. It is such a great CD that I often listen to it repeatedly in the car. Awesome buy!
B001OQCV6K|5.0|After finally catching serial killer and occult \\"sorcerer\\" Lord Blackwood, legendary sleuth Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson can close yet another successful case. But when Blackwood mysteriously returns from the grave and resumes his killing spree, Holmes must take up the hunt once again. Contending with his partner's new fianc&eacute;e and the dimwitted head of Scotland Yard, the dauntless detective must unravel the clues that will lead him into a twisted web of murder, deceit, and black magic - and the deadly embrace of temptress Irene Adler. An incredibly action/mystery story that also has great character development and brought to life the incredible partnership of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Mark Strong is terrific as the villainous Lord Blackwood. In addition to the great acting, the movie was visually stunning with 19th century London come to life. Terrific movie.

B002VECM6S|5.0|THE BLIND SIDE    I did not get to see this in theaters but I did hear nothing but good stuff about it, including one Sandra Bullock's performance. Then of course came the Oscar nomination and the win right afterwards, I hadn't seen the film but I was happy for her. Sandra has done some good stuff before so she earned it, although I had seen \\"Precious\\" and thought for sure the leading lady in that had it. Regardless I was not upset and thought good for Sandra. Since then I have seen it and Sandra's husband has cheated on her, kinda sucks I guess since her whole acceptance speech was about him having her back. Any way on to the review, Mr. KIA had basically said all that needs to be said on this film but I will write any way. I recommend reading his review.    This is the true story of Baltimore Ravens [hey I once lived in Maryland] player Michael Oher and the family that took him in. After a man helps him get into a good private school Mike still finds himself homeless, and basically alone in the world. That is until Leigh Anne Tuohy [Bullock] notices him talking to her son S.J. [Jae Head]. Later on she sees him walking in the rain and offers him a ride and a place to stay. The rest as the say is history, well there are some hurtles in the way. After taking him in they help him reach his potential in football, and basically in life. His story is very touching and inspirational and I am glad it worked out for him.    I had a good time watching this movie and even all the hype did not kill it for me. I thought the filmmaking was done greatly by writer/director John Lee Hancock. Based on the book by Michael Lewis I think they did a good job although obviously things have been left out. Still everyone did a good job especially the cast and Quinton Aaron especially who played Big Mike. Jae Head and Lily Collins are good as the kids and of course Kathy Bates is great in anything. Country singer Tim McGraw does a great job as Sandra's husband and may be the person who didn't get enough credit for the performance. Then of course there is Sandra Bullock who is now an Academy award winning actress. Does she deserve it is not up to me but I am happy for her and I am glad she got it.    I thought this was a good movie that has a lot of heart in it and I would recommend every one see it. Also for those who are interested I also recommend you read Mr. KIA's review. Whether you think Sandra deserved or not is pointless because this film is meant to be enjoyed. I think it is entertaining and I say go ahead and buy it, we did and I don't regret it.
8492429372|5.0|When I saw the movie of \\"Eragon\\" the history captivated me. I was looking for the books when I found out that they were a trilogy. Nevertheless, here in Costa Rica they were not to the sale. One month ago when I was for the capital of my country I was the first book. I read it and I was charmed with the history, since it is much better than the movie. Then ... I devoted myself to look for the lacking books in Amazon and well .... I must be grateful deeply for the seller of the book. In spite of being of the second hand it was coming in excellent condition and it ended for satisfying my need of reading.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This is a great movie.  I saw it in the theater and knew I would have to have the DVD.  It shows MJ as a real person with a great sense of humor and respect for his musicians and the knowledge of his music.  This is great opportunity to see MJ with out all that media hype that has plaqued him for years.  Highly recommended.
B00204AA0O|5.0|While one could make an argument that this album was overproduced and it lacks the 'Regina' touch to it, I would still disagree.  This was first Regina Spektor album I purchased, then I purchased Soviet Kitsch, 11:11, Begin to Hope, and finally Songs.  Being able to listen to Regina's work from her beginnings in 11:11 until this point is a great experience.  Through the series of about nine years you can feel the growth of her music and the growth of herself.  The most negative critiques of this album have been from people who either were in love with Regina from 11:11 or from people who caught onto her when Begin to Hope became mainstream and popular.  Her progression through the years has been dynamic and inspiring.  She always sings with deep, deep lyrics and taps into real emotions of the listener.  How she accomplishes this changes from album to album - which in my mind is beautiful.  Growing and changing is a part of life, and her music reflects this - but I still hear the foundation, the rock on which she stands.  Her piano playing, captivating lyrics, and unique voice are just as present in this album as they were in her other albums.  This album is interesting because she goes into new territory with songs like 'Machine' and I have to applaud her work.  I suppose what I appreciate about this album is the depth of emotion and her mastery over metaphor.  This album also does a great job of putting you into the story of the song, taking you out, confusing you, and finally letting you decide what happened.  All in all this is a wonderful album and I would recommend it to anyone.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|we took our daughter to see the movie when she was a little over one and she set throught the entire movie. when the DVD came out, my mother in law bought it for her.  it's been one of her favorite movies.  she loves balloons and dogs, so may be the combination makes her like this movie. we watch it everyday after the first 2 months we got it and now we still watch it at least once a week.
B00004RJ74|5.0|True Kill Bill style and you get George Clooney, vampires, lopping of limbs, George Clooney, jets of blood, tattooed George Clooney, and terror. Just a great date film.
B00005JM02|5.0|we used to play this every night for my daughter before she goes to sleep. now that she has a few more dvd she likes, we alternate. but when we go on long trips, we always bring this for her. when she sees sharks, turtle, fish and sting ray on tv, she calls them out by their names. definitely get one if you have kids.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game, different every time you set it up.  If you're playing with less experienced people the game play is more like 2 hours not 1 hour as I have read at various sites.
6305558167|5.0|When this first came out, I thought it was the best movie I had ever seen. I had read most of the Arthurian legend books, and Sir Thomas Mallory's L'MORTE D' ARTHUR was the best, and still is. This movie is as faithful to Mallory's work as the now greatest movie(s) ever made, The Lord Of The Ring Trilogy, is to Tolkein's books. Having now watched it again after buying and downloading, I still feel the same way, that it's one of the greatest movies ever made, period, and thus easily the best King Arthur legend movie ever. A true work of art.
B00005OM4N|4.0|The music of this album is one of many that's from Britney, adding with unique design, that I like.
B0000UJDLM|1.0|This DVD only operates in region 1 (USA), so beware if you are buying for any other region - we are unable to view it and are very annoyed that it is not shown as REGION 1 on the sales sites of AMAZON. Absolute waste of money. especially as we bought 2 other DVD's at the same time also region 1 only.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I have quite a few Jane Austen adaptation movies in my collection, so I'll give you an idea of my taste. My favorite versions have been Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley, BBC Pride and Prejudice, the new Masterpiece Sense and Sensibility, and both the new Masterpiece Persuasion and the one from the 90's. This has to be my favorite Emma by far. I enjoyed the Gwenyth Paltrow version because of Jeremy Northam, but I have never felt that it did the book justice. Besides, Gwenyth is decidedly NOT British. This new version is fantastic though. The actor playing Elton is actually the same guy that I loved in Mansfield Park, so that threw me a bit. However, he was perfect in the part, especially since Elton is supposed to be good looking, and it seems they rarely cast a good looking actor for the part. I love Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller as Emma and Knightley. They make the film. Michael Gambon as her father is perfect as well. Emma has never been my favorite Jane Austen story, but this film does it justice and makes the characters likeable.
B00000F14B|5.0|the music man was just a great movie of the 1960s. good family viewing. and very sentimental.
0743579275|5.0|This review is about the really outstanding audio cd version of this book. Both Dawkins and Ward read (or is it lecture) very well.     The switching between the two voices helps with focus and details. This excellent presentation helps keep the listener focused and listening to complicated and detailed information.     (Those who buy cd's to pass the time while driving may wish something requiring less concentration.)
B002RAREAK|5.0|I am satisfied with this album. This album is going to go multi-platinum! He returns to his original medium-making songs into masterpieces that illuminate the struggle between man and legend. He has come into his own as a sage artist, skillfully capturing the stirring emotions of the human heart in a complete, balanced album in soul-stirring jams, in serious grown man fashion. This album is priceless!
B002SGKI3S|5.0|Not one looks backwards,onward still he goes,  Yet ne'er looks forward farther than his nose.  No less alike the politic and wise;  All sly slow things,with circumspect eyes:   Men in their loose unguarded hours they take,  Not that themselves are wise,but others WEAK.  But grant that those can conquer,these can        cheat;  \\"T is phrase absurd to call a villain great:  Who wickedly is wise,or madly BRAVE,  Is but the more a fool,the more a knave.  Who noble ends by noble means obtains,  Or,failing,SMILES in exile or in chains,  Like good Aurelius let him reign,or bleed  Like Socrates,that man is great indeed.    The French Pegasus who walked on the wings of the 20th century and allowed us to see that man is only confined by his own inadequacy if he allows those that bequeath in their own mendacity the grasp and hold that far exceeds their own reach.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|This album is timeless! This album is a simple matter of integrity and authenticity, as in songwriting. The music assumed a more eclectic identity. She never wants to repeat herself. This album is going multi-platinum. I love SADE!!!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I saw this in the theatres and I've since seen it on DVD. Although it's only a day old in it's release, we all know that this is rushed and the more complete compendium is well on it's way. Patience.<br /><br />That being said, I found this to be a quite gritty, tenacious holding to the original text. I'm not sure how he does it, but Guy Ritchie found just the right actors, dialogue, stylists, and set designers to make this an ebullient gem. You can almost smell the cordite, creosote, coal smoke, dried roses, and dank rooms in this film. Mr Downey Jr.'s performance was admirable and well-played and Mr. Law was delightfully restrained and an intensely strong performer, as per his usual performances.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Ritchie! I can scarcely wait to see the behind-the-scenes extras that, I'm sure, are forthcoming.
1416955070|5.0|A divine mix of Harry Potter and Twilight, more Harry Potter-ish but sexier. Recommended by Stephenie Meyer.  Absolutely AWSOME SERIES!!!
B000002IJO|4.0|My favorite Ratt album.  It had no hits on it that you will still hear on the radio today or that you really heard when it came out either but I didn't care.  Does not have one song that I want to skip when listening to it.  Slip of the Lip is a great song.
B0002XVQNU|2.0|First, let me clarify my preferences so the reader can understand where I am coming from in this review:<br />1) I like DD as a comic character, but don't follow him regularly. I do have a bunch of the Frank Miller books and love them. The DD Noir stuff is dead-onto the character, in my opinion.<br />2) I hated the theatrical version of this film. Boring, without plot, and seriously lacking in character development. The film is a giant pop-rock music video with PG-13 violence for the kiddies.<br /><br />Okay, that said, I found this director's cut to be a bit of an improvement over the theatrical cut (T-cut from here). For one, there is a bit more plot which almost makes the characters interesting. There is a lot more Foggy Nelson and Ben Urich, two characters that were sorely missed in the T-cut. The majority of additions are a sub-plot that ties Kingpin to a supposedly open-and-shut murder case. It ultimately serves two purposes: a) to showcase Matt's talents as an attorney, and b) to show how the Kingpin's hand reaches into all aspects of the criminal justice system in NYC. Those are both worthy foundations for a better plot. We also get to see a bit more drama between Elektra and Matt, which is nice since the T-cut made it look like a love story instead of an inamourada tale.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite the improvements made in this cut, the film still suffers from its most fundamental flaw: Writer/Director Mark Steven Johnson. His \\"ultimate vision\\" of Daredevil is still a giant music video with no basic understanding of character. These are the problems that plague everything this man touches. He simply is a mediocre-at-best director and a terrible writer. Daredevil purists are going to have problems with the origin stories (or lack there-of in most cases), and general viewers are going to wonder how Elektra is a spoiled little rich girl and still a martial arts expert. Bullseye is still under-done and the Kingpin is never given the reverence he deserves.He is little more than a very wealthy bully in this film. Too bad.<br /><br />Overall, I give this 2 stars. 1 star for the film itself, and 1 star for the effort to turn a piece of trash into a slightly less disgusting piece of trash. Mostly, this last star comes from the fantastic on-screen chemistry between Jon Favreau and Ben Affleck which is revived by this extended cut. I recommend this version of the film to anyone who liked the T-cut and also to those who feel the need, like I did, to try and give it one more chance not to be terrible.
B0007YN74A|5.0|Ten Apples Up On Top is clearly the most underrated of the Seuss books, and perhaps the best!  My son absolutely loves the three characters and he's earned so much about counting to ten.  It's a fun little story and it's not simply page after page of ridiculous rhymes.
0515141429|4.0|The condition of the book is excellent but it tool 13 days to receive it. I understand this is the fault of the USPS. Many thanks!

B002GY9F9K|5.0|Thank you for filling and mailing my order for Ledgend of the Seeker:The Complete First Season so promptly. I recieved the DVD in the time period you promised and each member of my family enjoyed watching each and every one of the disc.  Thank You Again MKT
B000W4HIX6|4.0|Several reviewers have stated this is not much better than the DVD OR that it's an upconvert.  Neither is true.  The quality is true 1080P and looks as good as the original elements will allow.  Frankly it looks as good if not better than when I first saw it, which was at USC film school, a week BEFORE the film opened!  (Yeah, I was one of the first in America to see it, followed by a Q&A with McTiernan afterwards.)    Oh yeah, also -- I'm a post-production encoding tech, I stare/compare SD to HD transfers all night long at my job, I know the difference. In fact, in many cases, I'm one of the guys in the chain QCing the picture you see in your homes.    If you wanna see a bad Blu Ray that really is just a lousy SD upconvert, then buy \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" an indefensible move by MGM video.  I'm writing them now and sending that blu ray back for credit.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is one of the best movie epics I've ever seen... A truly fabulous, movie with superb acting. It was completely engrossing from the moment it started until the final scene. It is a work of art!  I truly recommend this movie... but extreme caution with allowing children to watch. There are a couple of extremely disturbing scenes which you may want to bypass for the sake of children.<br /><br />I was amazed at how well Paul did in his role... as did Linny. I had no idea he was this talented. He surprised me with his outstanding performance. Both were completely believable as if they were the original figures they portrayed and looked very close to the original couple as well. I almost did not recognize her without her blond hair.<br /><br />I also wanted to make note of the excellent musical score. Normally, I don't mention this but this was a unique sound combination of Irish flair violin and military cadence... very enjoyable. I was extremely impressed by the musical score.<br /><br />The movie also has a feature which brings up extensive historical notes throughout the entire film which you can opt to turn on. I recommend trying this on the second time you watch the film... it would ruin the movie if you do this on the first viewing.<br /><br />I enjoyed it so much, I intend to watch it more than once. It was that fantastic. I was quite astounded to find the movie so intriguing. It was a quality production on the scale of high dollar epics such as \\"Hawaii.\\" I can't say enough great things about it. I'm glad I didn't read any of the reviews prior to watching the movie. I'm not sure what movie these negative nellies were watching... but it wasn't the same movie I saw. I was completely immersed in the movie from the moment I turned it on until the final scene.<br /><br />It was refreshing to see some of the historical events finally being shown in the spirit of how they really were instead of the sugar coated facades we have been fed most of our lives... such as the Boston Massacre. It was provoked by a huge mob of 200-400 throwing rocks and ice inside snowballs at the British sentries. The incident was used by the colonists as propaganda. Sam Adams was a true rabble rouser just as depicted in the film. He was the biggest ringleader in the break from Britain with his drunken mob, \\"The sons of Liberty\\" who pulled all kinds of nasty deeds to drive out the British and start the revolution with England. (Tarring and feathering were indeed some of their deeds). While they were indeed the main catalyst behind the break from Britain... they weren't the fine, respectable gentlemen history had shown them to be.<br /><br />This movie shows them more accurately for the tavern mobs and street gangs they truly were. But depicting them as they were realistically, does not diminish the fact that it often takes a mob mentality to find the gumption to fight improprieties and crimes against liberties. Those with no hope, often don't have the strength to fight back as we've seen in slavery. But to show history other than it was is a disservice to us all. This movie brings back that reality to our history.<br /><br />For John Adams to have defended the hated British sentries so successfully after the shootings, in front of a Boston jury of colonists, is a tribute to his skills as an attorney and evidence of how badly this mob of colonists behaved.<br /><br />However, the depiction of the unbridled display of public ranting in the courtroom was totally unnecessary and I doubt accurate. I don't think any court... especially one still under the rules of the British, would have tolerated a rowdy public exhibition of the colonists in a courtroom. It almost ruined the viewing experience. Reminded me of the Trial by Q on Star Trek TNG Farpoint. Very irritating.<br /><br />No court would not have allowed the witnesses or accused to have been pressed in on and their testimonies intimidated and threatened by ranting, nasty crowds. However, Sam Adams wasindeed, every bit the hothead he was shown to be in this film.<br /><br />While it is true that 2 of the soldiers were actually found guilty of manslaughter (which was not depicted in the film)... their only punishment was to have their thumbs branded. Fortunately for the British sentries, one of the slain members of the mob provided a death bed statement as to the actual events which helped defend the actions of the guards. It wasn't the huge issue some reviewers made of the differences. You can read about this trial and incident online. [...]<br /><br />I was a little puzzled by the film first showing the Adam's to be living in town... and then showing them to be living on a farm outside of town. It is my understanding that they always lived on a farm but the massacre did take place within view of Mrs Adams. But the two houses were a bit confusing unless they had 2 homes at the same time?<br /><br />On the minor negatives, the one thing that was distracting to me was seeing Paul Giamatti's shaved bald head in the early scenes each time he came into the house and took off his wig. Colonial men did not shave their heads. They wore their hair long. So, every time they showed him pulling off his wig with the shaved head, it totally ruined those scenes for me because it broke the mood of the character and became an irritant. It was like having the actor take off their makeup during the scene. They need to keep the actor in character... not transpose 21st century hairstyles. Fortunately, they stopped doing this after the first DVD. Why go to the trouble to be historically accurate and then do something like this?<br /><br />The scene of cutting off his daughter's breast was totally unnecessary and uncalled for. There was no reason to subject the audience to that kind of thing... it is as bad as showing literal amputations. We don't need to see things like that. The film can make the issue known without showing us a gory graphic depiction of it. How would they like to see a graphic castration? This scene was mortifying and I would hate to think any child might be subjected to that. It was bad enough for adults. This was a VERY BAD lack of judgment on the directors part... and the producer who should have been keeping track of what the director was doing.<br /><br />Again, there was no need to horrify the audience. This film should have been a family docu-drama... and still can be with elimination of a couple of those unnecessary scenes.<br /><br />The other scene which was a negative issue was the tar & feather scene. Most people who watch a historical docu-drama are not expecting full frontal nudity for one with half exposure of the genitals... 97% nudity at least... especially if they are showing this to their family. It was also quite brutal, too literal and far too much time spent on it. It could have been depicted without forcing the audience to endure the full ordeal. While it may be authentic... it was not necessary.<br /><br />We also did not need to see the graphic depiction of the pox vaccinations and the daughter's ordeal. It is ok to include it but the level of graphic details were not needed. It was really quite disturbing. Accuracy does not always required graphic display. For instance, we do not need to see the contents of the bucket to know that someone has thrown up. The sound alone is more than enough to indicate the same.<br /><br />I also agree that they should have shown more about the political mudslinging with Jefferson and Hamilton and more about the animosity that was occurring at the time he lost his bid for re-election. It was a major issue of the rift between them. There were also too many do-nothing scenes of Adams sitting in the gutted white house and not enough of Adams interactions with politics and politicians. They really showed nothing of him being president.<br /><br />Having lived in France during the 66 Exodus of Americans, it was refreshing to finally see the behaviors and attitudes of the French being portrayed more true to life on a film and Adam's reaction to them. The reason this is important is because it helps to understand why there has always been such bitterness between the French and British and Americans. In fact, there were things a lot worse than was shown on the film... from hygiene, to attire and behaviors I have witnessed in person, which are so bad I cannot repeat them on here. I can only imagine what our diplomats encountered 200 years earlier. (Tourists don't see these things. If you haven't lived in the older, unmodernized sectors of the country... you don't know the these aspects).<br /><br />While Benjamin Franklin was amazing on a lot of things... there was a dark side to him which was not that pretty for history or public consumption. It was refreshing to see this other side of him for a change. I had read about Ben Franklin's lewd habits from many sources... especially his escapades in France. He spent nearly all of his life overseas and almost none in the colonies until after the Constitution. While he was quick of wit, funny and brilliant... he was also a shameless, lazy lothario who spent all of his time partying with ladies from the brothels and had no use or time for his wife or family. Fans of Franklin's don't like to hear about his darker nature... but that's how he truly was by his own admission whether his fans like it or not. Celebrities are not perfect and some have very bad sides as was the case with Benjamin Franklin. He was admittedly a dirty old man, self indulgent who completely ignored his own family and children. He was lazy and irresponsible and admitted to spending most of his time fornicating with the lowest and nastiest of street women as depicted in this movie instead of doing the job he was sent there to do. His behavior was shameless and many lives were lost while he partied to satiate his own debaucheries.<br /><br />There is an excellent DVD of Franklin's life in the history channel set \\"The founding of America\\" showing a lot of Franklin's true behavior... but this Adam's miniseries did an excellent job showing Franklin's (rarely exhibited) caustic personality and reactions at having his shameless, x-rated cavorting disrupted. He used his popularity as a weapon of power and usually kept this dark side hidden from public. He reveled and garnered public adoration by using wit, humorous anecdotes and quips in his publications. He also enjoyed amazing the uneducated masses with sideshow tricks already known by scientists of that era... but which awestruck the commoners whom had never seen such things. Static generators had long since been developed before his kite experiment but his stunt made it appear to the masses he was the first to deal with such things. It was all presentation for the attention he so readily craved.<br /><br />He enjoyed having his ego stoked & fed with clamoring crowds of admirers. The people of France treated him like they did Jackie Kennedy... as a celebrity. They had his face printed on all kinds of souvenirs and gadgets. Franklin's face was on so many things that the King of France had a bedpan made with Franklin's face... which should give you an idea how Franklin's personal pursuit of celebrity attention for his own pleasure had actually damaged the King's impression of the colonists and caused him to look down upon us. Thus, Franklin was not doing the job so desperately needed by our soldiers and Gen Washington... but the colonial congress was full of egocentric dandies who weren't any better than Franklin... and weren't any more interested in holding up their promises to the troops either. They all thought Franklin was great fun, thus Franklin was never reprimanded. He had free reign to indulge his indiscretions without oversight.<br /><br />To get even more attention, Franklin even took to wearing coonskin hats... something he never did anywhere other than France. The ladies even designed their hairstyles over his hats. He liked beingthe center of attention to bring him endless ladies and parties.<br /><br />Adams wanted to get down to business and talk details of supplies and support for the colonial troops. But Franklin didn't want Adams to screw up his own egomaniacal celebrity status in France which brought him endless droves of ladies, parties and personal attention to stroke his ego. Franklin spent years in France partying with the ladies instead of doing his job to get funding, weapons and military support for our troops. Sure, he finally got it... After we won a decisive battle and they did turn the tide at the end... but how many soldiers died in the interim so that Franklin could enjoy his years of brothel lifestyle?<br /><br />He didn't want Adam's rocking the boat for his personal entertainment. The depiction of the animosity on this film was excellent and the best rendition I have seen of the \\"real\\" Benjamin Franklin which the colonists never got to see. Franklin spent the first 70 years of his life in England and nearly a decade in France. Only the final years after the Constitution did he live in the US... after his wife died while he was cavorting in France.<br /><br />While some reviewers made a big deal out of Adam's relationship with his son Charles... Franklin had the same with his own son and didn't speak to him. But the portrayal on this film was accurate to the historical info available from many other reference sources. However, Charles was one of those kids who never listened and was constantly getting into trouble. There are just some kids who are like this regardless of the parent. John Adams also raised a son who became President... so he had a son at each end of the spectrum... so that doesn't indicate the parent was bad. Often, the younger sons act out toward older brothers who they perceive as the parent's pet. You see this with royal families all the time. A lot of families with multiple boys usually has two opposite boys. Just look at Princes William and Harry. So for a reviewer to blame the father seems more like a personal issue. A broader view will show this is a common thing in larger families and especially in families of notoriety. But can also be due to parental or position related favoritism as well.<br /><br />Congress sent Adams abroad to get rid of him. As a lawyer and an honest man, he was particular to details and honor and making good on promises. The Colonial Congress didn't support Washington's troops with the supplies, food, money and munitions they so desperately needed. As Adams stated... they just liked hearing themselves talk and thinking of themselves as important men. They were only interested in their own social standings and notoriety... much like Franklin, although in a different manner.<br /><br />One other scene which was poorly done was the scene with King George. Very badly written and even worse portrayed by the actor. The way he stood there by the chair, you were questioning whether or not he was the King at all or whether he was a footman. This scene should have been completely redone. It was one of the few badly written, badly acted scenes in the entire movie.<br /><br />Adams wasn't a \\"good ole boy\\" or one of the \\"social elite\\" so he didn't play along when the rest of the representatives who didn't keep their words or do their duty. He believed in being forthright, honest and responsible. Adams would have rocked the boat in the congress rather than let our troops suffer the way they did... so they sent Adam's to Europe to get rid of him. Unfortunately, being a man of integrity and honor bound to duty... he did what he was told. He should have just gotten on a boat and come back or refused. But being duty-bound, he allowed them to run him around without disputing it. The only way Congress would have done their jobs would have been by tossing it back in their laps. This movie did an excellent job showing the egotism, selfishness and petty bickering of our representatives of that era. Not sodifferent from today. Unfortunately, Adam's didn't have the fortitude to speak out and stand up against them. He was a \\"loyal patriot\\" who did whatever they assigned him to.<br /><br />However, it was also refreshing to see that realism of the petty bickering in Congress and the impotent group they truly were instead of the sugar coated facade we have been shown in school most of our lives. Like Adams said about the painting at the end... the image was a fraudulent depiction from how it truly was and our politicians have made sure history was redesigned to make them all look like gallant saviors. Adams & Jefferson did most of the work while the rest bickered and whined.<br /><br />The behavior of the colonists depicted by this movie is indeed authentic... as was the behavior of John's hothead, rabble rousing, political agitator cousin, Sam Adams. The colonists did behave like lawless mobs. This movie did show a realistic depiction of how they really behaved at that time. In fact, most of them would get liquored up and stirred into a frenzy then go out into the streets looking for someone or something to transfer their rage against. Sam's \\"Sons of Liberty\\" were made up of the hotheaded drunkards who spent most of their time in the taverns. This is a historical fact whether or not people like it. It is unfortunate that some immature people create idyllic images in their minds which have no bearing on actual events whatsoever. Even worse are those efforts history has made to glorify or demonize various events in a manner which has no comparison with the truth... and then teach those falsehoods in our history lessons.<br /><br />It was about time that someone did a realistic rendition of the true events and circumstances of our history. We need to see history as it truly was... not as we would like it to be.<br /><br />An excellent film. I highly recommend it but I would advise extreme caution on the two or three scenes if you intend to allow your children to watch. You should locate and preview those scenes before you allow your children to watch... then you can skip past them when permitting your children to view the film so they won't be subjected to it.sonality and reactions at having his shameless, x-rated cavorting disrupted.

However, Charles was one of those kids who never listened and was constantly getting into trouble. There are just some kids who are like this regardless of the parent. John Adams also raised a son who became President... so he had a son at each end of the spectrum... so that doesn't indicate the parent was bad. Often, the younger sons act out toward older brothers who they perceive as the parent's pet. You see this with royal families all the time. A lot of families with multiple boys usually has two opposite boys. Just look at Princes William and Harry. So for a reviewer to blame the father seems more like a personal issue. A broader view will show this is a common thing in larger families and especially in families of notoriety. But can also be due to parental or position related favoritism as well.    Congress sent Adams abroad to get rid of him. As a lawyer and an honest man, he was particular to details and honor and making good on promises. The Colonial Congress didn't support Washington's troops with the supplies, food, money and munitions they so desperately needed. As Adams stated... they just liked hearing themselves talk and thinking of themselves as important men. They were only interested in their own social standings and notoriety... much like Franklin, although in a different manner.    One other scene which was poorly done was the scene with King George. Very badly written and even worse portrayed by the actor. The way he stood there by the chair, you were questioning whether or not he was the King at all or whether he was a footman. This scene should have been completely redone. It was one of the few badly written, badly acted scenes in the entire movie.    Adams wasn't a \\"good ole boy\\" or one of the \\"social elite\\" so he didn't play along when the rest of the representatives who didn't keep their words or do their duty. He believed in being forthright, honest and responsible. Adams would have rocked the boat in the congress rather than let our troops suffer the way they did... so they sent Adam's to Europe to get rid of him. Unfortunately, being a man of integrity and honor bound to duty... he did what he was told. He should have just gotten on a boat and come back or refused. But being duty-bound, he allowed them to run him around without disputing it. The only way Congress would have done their jobs would have been by tossing it back in their laps. This movie did an excellent job showing the egotism, selfishness and petty bickering of our representatives of that era. Not so different from today. Unfortunately, Adam's didn't have the fortitude to speak out and stand up against them. He was a \\"loyal patriot\\" who did whatever they assigned him to.    However, it was also refreshingto see that realism of the petty bickering in Congress and the impotent group they truly were instead of the sugar coated facade we have been shown in school most of our lives. Like Adams said about the painting at the end... the image was a fraudulent depiction from how it truly was and our politicians have made sure history was redesigned to make them all look like gallant saviors. Adams & Jefferson did most of the work while the rest bickered and whined.    The behavior of the colonists depicted by this movie is indeed authentic... as was the behavior of John's hothead, rabble rousing, political agitator cousin, Sam Adams. The colonists did behave like lawless mobs. This movie did show a realistic depiction of how they really behaved at that time. In fact, most of them would get liquored up and stirred into a frenzy then go out into the streets looking for someone or something to transfer their rage against. Sam's \\"Sons of Liberty\\" were made up of the hotheaded drunkards who spent most of their time in the taverns. This is a historical fact whether or not people like it. It is unfortunate that some immature people create idyllic images in their minds which have no bearing on actual events whatsoever. Even worse are those efforts history has made to glorify or demonize various events in a manner which has no comparison with the truth... and then teach those falsehoods in our history lessons.    It was about time that someone did a realistic rendition of the true events and circumstances of our history. We need to see history as it truly was... not as we would like it to be.    An excellent film. I highly recommend it but I would advise extreme caution on the two or three scenes if you intend to allow your children to watch. You should locate and preview those scenes before you allow your children to watch... then you can skip past them when permitting your children to view the film so they won't be subjected to it.
0393072231|5.0|There are history books and then there are special books that help personalize history. Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" is widely acclaimed as THE definitive book about the plight of the working class around the turn of the last century. John Steinbeck's \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is also a must-read to personalize the Great Depression. In my opinion, decades later, \\"The Big Short\\", will be THE definitive ancestor of these two past books, providing future generations, the human story behind the banking crisis of 2008.<br /><br />All three books educate by storytelling. There are a lot of people who can write books on history. But very few can take complex subjects and break them down into digestible bits weaved with the power of good story telling.<br /><br />The unforgettable character's in this great book are Steven Eisman, the outspoken moralist, Michael Burry, the one-eyed doctor turned investor, Gregg Lippmann, the \\"whack job\\", and Charlie Ledley, the born contrarian.<br /><br />Like Larry David's \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" all of the characters are hilarious and at the end become pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that come together in a comical way to counter-intuitively make the reader understand the crisis and become angry.<br /><br />This book is not only a good read, but it's original hardcover, will be worth a lot of money, many years from now.
B0008ENICU|5.0|George Cukor directed this wicked tale about a bunch of high society women in New York City who intermingle with each other. Starring a who's who of some of the best actresses in Hollywood in the 1930's, \\"The Women\\" starred Norma Shearer, Rosalind Russell, and Joan Crawford, with Joan stealing the movie from her co-stars. Although not the biggest part in the film, Crawford, desperate for a meaty role after playing shop girls for over ten years, agreed to the part saying she would play Wallace Barry's grandmother if it were well written. Crawford's depiction of Crystal, the man-stealing husband with claws of an alley cat, is her first depiction of bitchy roles that she would become famous for. The movie is known for having no male acting parts and according to some even the animals were female. 1939, the year in which \\"The Women\\" was made, was one of the best years Hollywood had with \\"Gone With The Wind\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"  playing in theatres. In 2009 a remake of \\"The Women\\" was made with Meg Ryan, but is simply best forgotten. This DVD comes with vintage documentaries as well as trailers for \\"The Women\\" and \\"The Opposite Sex\\", a 1950's remake starring Joan Collins in the Crawford role.

B003ELOQD4|5.0|Right. While I wasn't at the Norman Oklahoma show - I WAS at THIS show and I can tell you that it was hands down the BEST concert I have ever been to. Bono and the boys put on a FANTASTIC show and surprisingly, the Black Eyed Peas put on a GREAT show themselves *thanks to the surprise appearance by Slash*. But U2 definitely delivered. I especially loved Bono's shout-out to his MEXICAN fans in Los Angeles during \\"Vertigo\\" with his shouting \\"Viva Mexico\\", it drove us ALL crazy! I will CERTAINLY be buying this when it comes out.

0385528752|5.0|Easily one of the best business / psychology book on changing behavior and culture.  With the simple framework of making change easier by understanding a process (rider - rational mind, elephant - emotional mind, shaping the path) and multiple anecdotes, the authors make a compelling argument on how to make things happen.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0439023491|5.0|I read this book in two sittings.  It was incredible.  Most say it's not as good as the first but I strongly disagree.  What a fantastic follow up!<br /><br />The Hunger Games introduces us to the lovable characters, the crazy insane ways of the Capitol, and the  despicable games themselves.  But Catching Fire just adds fuel to already huge flames. In this great sequel we dig deeper in to the relationships Katniss started with the Capitol in the first.<br /><br />The Capitol forces each of twleve districts to send two children -one boy and one girl- to fight to the dead in an arena.  The event is televised and is supposed to be a reminder of a previous rebellion against the Capitol.  Katniss (the main character) finds a way to win the annual Hunger Games with a partner!  Usually only one victor is crowned.  I'll leave it at that for those who haven't read the first book yet.  But man, hurry up and get to it already you won't be sorry!<br /><br />In Catching Fire, Katniss starts to finally become aware of the power she has and what she is able to do with it.  She uses her knowledge to inspire rebellion against the Capitol with the help of some friends and family. Again I don't want to give away too much.  But this book and the first are truely inspiring.  They make you think about how crazy the world could get, what to do when give the choice of doing something easy and doing something right, humanity, and other issues.<br /><br />These books left me longing for more.  You won't be sorry for reading them! And please, Ms. Collins lets have the conclusion already!

B000MV8XPG|5.0|I bought this for my 3-1/2 year old son and it is a great product. My only complaint is that it took me over an hour to assemble (I don't do this kind of thing very often) and that I made a mistake, which could not be undone - the digger still works though.
B001KVZ6G6|1.0|First off, the movie looked and sounding excellent, but the story was absolute GARBAGE! The first 20 minutes are so touching and sweet and then the whole thing just falls off an absurd cliff.  The whole plot (if you can call it that) was lame.  Great character setup and then the dumbest plot scenario pixar has ever done.    That being said, when you put the movie in you are FORCED to sit through stupid preview after preview of straight to video movies no one cares about.  When Disney forces you to sit through this crap it takes the re-watch-ability factor to zero. Next, in order to get the bluray, you have to buy DVD and digital copy.  They pulled this crap with Monsters Inc as well.  An old movie that just about every pixar fan ALREADY OWNS on DVD and they expect us to buy it AGAIN.     DISNEY! knock off this type of garbage or people will stop buying your releases

B00006DEFA|5.0|Between film and theatre, there lie many discrepancies in focus that set the two art forms vastly apart. In theatre, everything is exaggerated and enhanced for theatrical effect. There is much imagination and symbolism, while realism is largely diminished for theatrical and dramatic purposes, but also for budgetary reasons.  In adapting a theatre piece into a film, these differences must be considered with great care, so as not to simply set in motion the filming of a play. The realism that theatre lacks must be sufficiently developed and captured on camera in a way that sets apart the two interpretations. With Amadeus, Milos Forman skillfully manages to balance and differentiate what elements make a film, and what elements make a play.    The realism that Forman manages to draw out of Peter Shaffer's play and screenplay adaptation can easily be attributed to the director's thirst for authenticity, which can be seen oozing from the pores of his 1975 film, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. During production on Cuckoo's Nest, he had his actors staying at Oregon State hospital, where they had intimate experience with genuine mental patients, and where the film's interior scenes were shot. This \\"on-location\\" style of filmmaking served Forman well then, drawing out terrifyingly real performances from the cast, most of whom were unknown at the time, again adding to the reality and pretense of the film.  These are the same kinds of techniques that Forman uses once again in Amadeus, made in 1984, roughly nine years after Cuckoo's Nest. The movie was shot entirely on-location in Prague, Czechoslovakia, which was under communist rule at the time. Foreman is also from Czechoslovakia, and his familiarity with the country allowed him to envision the city of Prague as being the perfect filming location for the setting of the script: Vienna. Because the country was under communist rule, the city of Prague was essentially decades behind in appearances and technology, which added tothe authenticity of being able to film anywhere without danger of capturing anything too modern.     Watching the film, it indeed seems as if Forman and his cast and crew time-traveled to 18th Century Vienna, and began filming. An opening sequence set in a mental hospital was filmed in a neglected military museum, and the debut of Mozart's Don Giovanni was shot on location in the theatre where the opera actually premiered more than a century prior. In addition to the on-location filming, Foreman once again chose to cast largely unknown actors in the lead roles. F. Murray Abraham, who won the Oscar for playing Salieri, had been in the business for a time, but had never received much recognition. Tom Hulce had done some work, but Mozart was and still is his most notable performance to date. The performances, and the Prague location ground the film in a deep and magnificent realm of reality and drama that Forman captures in a way that only he could have done. He develops an atmosphere of pretense that his characters manage to mimic and parallel in their actions. Salieri pretends to be Mozart's companion, while secretly he consistently plots to sabotage his career in a fit of jealous madness. There is pretense shaded into the film just as it is shaded into the actual production, which emulates Forman's style and technique.     It is also worth noting that in Amadeus, the music of Mozart is the third main character. It does not suggest or dictate what we, the audience, should be feeling. It stands alone as an independent force of emotion, just as Jack Nitzsche's theme in Cuckoo's Nest does, and so it is no surprise that one of the film's eight Oscar's was for best sound.
B0030Y10QQ|3.0|Savatage is one of those bands to which no best-of compilation can do justice. Each period, from the band's early era to their encounter with Paul O'Neill during their mid era where they produced their absolute masterpieces (Gutter Ballet - Streets - Edge of Thorns) to their more progressive and symphonic stuff, is vastly different and should be listened to in its entirity. It is virtually impossible to cover the Savatage sound in a double CD.<br /><br />Therefore, this compilation is primarily recommended only to die-hard fans and completists. I doubt even they would actually prefer to listen to Still the Orchestra Plays, though. Listening to only two or three songs from an album is far from leaving a huge effect, especially if said songs are from concept albums such as Streets, Dead Winter Dead, The Wake of Magellan, or Poets & Madmen (which is represented with just one song -- blasphemy!).<br /><br />When the band released the compilation From the Gutter to the Stage in 1995, they included some bonus material, of which \\"This Is Where You Should Be\\" and the acoustic version of \\"D.T. Jesus\\" were absolutely mindblowing. Still the Orchestra Plays also contains three bonus tunes: acoustic versions of \\"Anymore\\", \\"Not What You See\\", and \\"Out on the Streets\\". All of them were recorded in 2009 by Jon Oliva. I remember reading somewhere that Jon also plays the guitar on the songs, but the booklet won't confirm me. The songs sound okay, but nowhere near as powerful as the original versions, especially \\"Not What You See\\". I was looking forward to hearing this one in an acoustic setting and Jon's unique singing, but it sounds totally uninspired and it seems like they were recorded because they had to be recorded as bonus material for a compilation.<br /><br />My point is get this package if you want to have a DVD copy of the band's Live in Japan disc (recorded at a club in Kawasaki on 11/12/1994). This has already been available on VHS tape for years, but having it on DVD is still great. For those of you who haven't heard/watched this show, the lineup consists of Zak Stevens on vocals, Alex Skolnick on lead guitars, Johnny Lee Middleton on bass, Jeff Plate on drums, and Jon Oliva on keys. Given that this album came out shortly after Handful of Rain, the first album without Criss Oliva on lead guitars, it mostly contains songs off of this record to accommodate Skolnick's style of playing. Exceptions are songs like \\"Edge of Thorns\\", \\"Damian\\", and \\"Jesus Saves\\", but I've always felt the lead guitars on \\"Edge of Thorns\\" sound quite different even though I love Skolnick as a guitar player. Also, while Zak Stevens is an absolutely perfect singer, he doesn't capture the same intensity on the Jon Oliva pieces. Oliva also does some vocals at the end of the show, sharing vocals with Zak on \\"Gutter Ballet\\" and wrapping things up with \\"Hall of the Mountain King\\".<br /><br />This is a digipack -- I've always favoured jewel cases, so I can't say I am thrilled by that. Also, there is nothing special in the booklet: no liner notes, no new pictures, or anything. The booklet contains lyrics and credits, and the cover art looks rather rushed compared to the band's studio releases. At least the SPV reissues that came out a few years ago had great liner notes, explaining the songs and how they were written and recorded. This one pales in comparison to it. The songs are arguably remastered, but Savatage has always been one of the greatest produced bands on the planet, so the original songs sounded perfect already. Maybe the ones on this compilation are slightly \\"louder\\" but honestly who cares about the loudness war?<br /><br />Bottom line is get this if you want to have the DVD.

B002WA4O8K|5.0|The Brilliance of the Seven Spiritual Laws: One Cell- One Universe   By Marcielle Brandler     \\"If you look at any cell in the human body, you will see through its functioning the expression of these [seven spiritual] laws. ... DNA is a perfect example of pure potentiality.\\" -The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success, Deepak Chopra 105. Deepak shows us scientifically the quantum physics of the spiritual laws of the universe that gurus, saints, and simple people have employed throughout history to improve life on this planet, thus improving their own lives and their own value as Spirit. By giving, a person like a cell receives. The cell is part of a larger whole and cannot harm another cell without harming itself. So, we follow that same plan. We are bodies in the larger body- like it or not.     Our lives must be about preserving Community, which is our larger societal Universe. Cooperation and harmony (not force) are necessary to preserve Community. A piece by Martin Luther King, \\"Pilgrimage to Nonviolence,\\" denounces force and promotes nonviolent protest. It supports the Laws of which Deepak speaks. King uses Gandhi's model and says that the goal of this kind of resistance is to shame the abuser into realizing that Community must be served, and that if we use violence, we oppose Community, thus we cannot succeed. The idea of a cell in the body, a group in the larger body of humanity, and a being in the greater universe, and of the spirit inside the larger Spirit is very powerful and has convinced me that my former idea of using force to fight an oppressor was incorrect.     Deepak also says, \\"If you want something, help others get it.\\" Many of us have seen this in action. When we serve others, we provide for them, thus they are willing to pay for our services or we just add to who we are. John Rohn calls this, \\"becoming more valuable.\\" - The Art of Exceptional Living. Deepak discussed how meditation works. \\"The spaces between your thoughts is the link to infinite power.Rational thought does not do this. Every cell in your body has this computing ability.\\" You know when something is a wrong decision, because you feel discomfort. You know when it is right, because you feel pleasure. It is built into us. And, remember that confusion is discomfort, so we cannot rationalize our way out of making an incorrect choice when we make a decision based on confusion.     Karma is not a tit for tat payback system. If I give to Mary and expect her to give me the equivalent in return, I am not giving unconditionally. My \\"reward' may be in the act of being able to give, having the ability to give to one who cannot give, by virtue of her position in society, or even her emotional or psychological ability to give. My \\"reward\\" may come from some other quadrant and at some other time altogether. By giving, we receive. We become strong and we become \\"more giving,\\" that is, our capacity to give is expanded, thus making us bigger people. Is not our purpose on this planet to grow? All things grow or wither. Those who withhold their love and bounty, wither. Those who give, expand.    Marcielle Brandler is a prize-winning poet and author of The Breathing House.

B001G7R9FA|5.0|This is a very good book, BUT you need to have some sort of background in Physics to read this book. It is too difficult to understand what the author is driving at. Another problem with this book is that the author goes on too many rants.    The First half of the book is to provide a general overview of the history of the development and the results of experiments in the fields of quantum, sub atomic, particle physics etc.    The second half of the book is an attempt to convey to the reader what the author has issues with in regards to string theory. The problem is he does not concisely outline his issues. You never know what the author is driving at.    To get a better understanding of this subject I recommend reading the following two books in the following order: 1) Fearful Symmetry by A. Zee. 2)  The Trouble with Physics by Lee Smolin.      Fearful Symmetry starts with the very basic, and then builds up to the state of string theory as of circa 1987. Lee Smolin (2005) then very concisely describes the issues with string theory on page 187.     I recommend reading \\"Not Even Wrong\\" after reading the two books mentioned above.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Salma Kahlo   By Marcielle Brandler     I saw a Biography segment on A&E Channel on Salma Hayek of whom I was vaguely aware. She was shopping her biographical Frida Kahlo idea around Hollywood. Thank God she did not allow them overlay what I call the Hollywood Formula onto her idea. She finally got Julie Taymor (Lion King stage play) to direct it, and what direction it was! The colors! The moods, everything was so Mexican! Taymor's experience with puppetry was put to dazzling use in the entire film. I was blown away by her dream-like, or (should I say) nightmare-like sequence of doctors and spines, revealing the poignancy of Frida's physical pain and hospital stays. It was comic and horrific, harking back to Day-of-the-Dead comi-tragic imagery.     Kayak's courage in attempting some daring scenes and appropriate nudity caused me to admire this beautiful model. There is an erotic spirituality about this film. It is very woman-like, also with remnants of what among poets and fiction writers used to be called Magical Realism, peculiar to Latino writers of this century.     I enjoyed Frida's manly qualities and wondered if they really belonged to her or merely of Salma's interpretation of her. When Frida dances with Ashley Judd, I felt the sexual tension coming from Salma but not from Judd. In an interview, Judd said that scene made her uncomfortable. That moment was lacking for me, possibly because I have seen real tango dancers in Argentina with the sensually arrogant machismo both the male and female dancers exude.     A friend of mine complained that there was one huge flaw in the film. The real Frida Kahlo had several parrots and other birds in her home. Yes, that was part of Kahlo's life, but there were so many startling moments, that such a detail does not matter a damn to me. I told my friend that perhaps since it was such a complicated film to direct. that more animals would be a distraction from the story's tension. Bird images are very common to those who know, even peripherally, Frida Kahlo's paintings.     In other countries, people really do spontaneously break into song, and in this film such moments occured at just the right time to bare Frida's anguish and touch our souls.     It can be a temptation to make an unfaithful lover look like a complete cad, but Alfred Molina manages to play Diego Rivera (Frida's famous artist husband) as simpatico. We love him in spite of his numerous transgressions. That, in itself is a real coup.     Visit Marcielle Brandler's website at: [...]  She is a tv producer, college educator, author, and hiker.

B00003CX8Y|3.0|This DVD film looks great on the screen...    The packaging looks like it was created by a blind robot.  The print of the inserts is amateurish.  As if the originals were printed on a color copier.     MISSPELLINGS!  It's as if they used OCR (optical Character Recognition) to obtain the text and didn't bother to do the first spell check.  There are things in the main TITLES of the sections that make absolutely NO SENSE.  Like, \\"Be Our Guest To An Al HTS!\\"  and \\"Bonus Feature Highlig L-New DVD Experience!\\" and \\"Disc 1: Navigntional overview\\".     These are but a tiny sampling of the mess that is the DVD insert.  Apostrophes that are commas, double-spacing that shouldn't be, words where the letters are all re-arranged, etc.    I'm starting to think that either I've been sold a bootleg or Disney's stamp \\"Made in USA\\" on the back isn't exactly true.    When you pay $30 for a DVD that was purchased online with no overhead, you think you might get better quality and some attention to detail.  After all, this was supposed to be a \\"Platinum Edition\\"!  Disney's best?
B0034C9CFK|5.0|Packin' up the Freight Train after more than 20 years with Arista Records, Alan bids a consistent farewell to a Remarkable chapter of his career!  This album (out now for just a day) most admittedly does not hit you like \\"Good Time\\" the best country album from 2008-2009.  In terms of Country Music awards \\"Good Time\\" was the most over-looked album in over a decade.  Why?  Maybe the Nashville-elite didn't like the fact that Alan Jackson went it alone and wrote all 17 tracks on the album with great success!  It was a career first for him, although he has always been a prolific writer of \\"simple-songs\\" and most of his own biggest hits.  Well, on \\"Freight Train\\" he lets a handful of others into the mix on 3 tracks and pulls off a fantastically country-to-the-core cover with Lee Ann Womack on the Gosdin penned \\"Till the End.\\"<br /><br />  \\"Freight Train\\" might lack many of the number 1 knock-out hits that made \\"Good Time\\" great, however, I think that it is more consistently good...  There isn't a weak track of the new album's 12 tracks, while the last had a couple of \\"I Still Like Bologna\\" & \\"Nothing Left to Do\\" type tracks that weren't horrible yet put a few kinks in an otherwise outstanding 17 track line-up.  [For my tastes, anyway]  \\"Hard Hat and a Hammer\\" is another in a line of tribute to the \\"working class hero\\"-type songs that Alan has been so good to put out over the years... This gets the album off to a decent enough start which highlights include, but aren't limited too the first single \\"It's Just That Way,\\" \\"Freight Train,\\" \\"Taillights Blue,\\" \\"Till the End,\\" \\"Big Green Eyes,\\" and my personal favorite upon my first listen \\"True Love is a Golden Ring!\\"  Alan Jackson's songs make a great soundtrack to the life a \\"simple-man\\" which probably explains why he's my favorite living country artist.  For me he is up there with Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson; Patsy Cline; George Strait; Martina McBride and any other Country Great in any conversation on the topic.  His discography just got that much deeper and its as important as any body recording in any genre of music today.  In one word this album is \\"Genuine\\" country...  This is a buy, even if the 12 clips that Amazon let's you hear don't get you, the quality of the effort as an artistic whole will!<br /><br />  Lastly, if this doesn't convince you, then just go back and listen to or buy \\"Drive\\" and your mind will be blown.

B00065MDRW|3.0|I write this review in memory of a great friend, wonderful man and excellent rock drummer, Chris Taylor, may he forever jam in peace. Amazon asked if I was over 13 - well, yes, dammit - I was over 13 when this first came out in '69 and can scarcely believe that was nearly half a century ago. Chris loved this record which, at the time, struck me as messy and pretentious. But with the passing of oceans under the bridge how does it sound to me now? Answer: Messy and pretentious. However, in memory of my dear friend I have to admit that it does have one, albeit dubious, redeeming feature: the single worst cover in the history of rock!    I imagine that this album appeals most to guitarists with pedalphilia (an inordinate love of distortion fx) or perhaps to those more recent additions to the human race who are nostalgic for a period they never lived through.    I should guess these noises are much more fun to make than to listen to but for those intent on trying to recapture the genuine feel of the sixties you could do worse than listen to CSN's first album - any track of which is capable of propelling this old hippie back to that short but golden era the like of which we shall never see again. Peace and Love man.
B001BMXFX0|4.0|The Lovely Bones, a beautiful and individual novel by Alice Sebold, is a story about a girl, Suzie, who is murdered by her neighbor. The entire book is written in first person, while Suzie is looking down on her family's grief from heaven.     It is a bit of a mystery, as the police have no leads and don't know who the killer is. The father and his other daughter have an instinct, but the police won't believe them without evidence. This story is intriguing and will have you hooked from the beginning.    I would most definitely recommend this book because, as a high school student, I believe that all girls should be aware of the danger out there and that not all people have good intentions. It is tough to get into in the beginning, because of the graphic imagery, but after the first chapter, it is a truly inspired story.
0385532458|5.0|This is a wonderful book of 7 short stories and another example of John Grisham's great imagination and/ or perhaps life experiences.    These stories take place in Ford County and in Clanton in Mississippi and they deal with various contemporary issues of these denizens, and range from funny and comical to serious and as a pathetic reminder to our messed up world. They are the stories of simple folks, some of whom face their challenges with the only way they know.   We laugh at the hilarious story of the incompetent blood donors, who were forced into action, as well as the story about the retirement home escapades. We marvel at corrupt small town lawyers, a negligent doctor, whose unchallenged incompetence has lead to serious birth defects in a child and we confront death penalty at the 'big house' Parchman which is familiar to Grisham readers. There is casino gambling on 'indian tribes' territory, with a man who 'beats the bank', and corrupt lawyers and insurance companies anger us and finally we see the effects of AIDS on a community, family and victim. He tells the stories of very believable people, sometimes strong people, who do the best they can, and shows the often terrible chasm that exists between the legal world and the rest of the world and how often there is very little understanding and that many people live lives of quiet desperation.....a very readable and enjoyable book.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|I bought this movie thinking with all the hype that it would be wonderful.  Not so.  A waste of money.  I have seen many disaster movies in the past that were much better.  eathquake was one of them.
B0039OFMA2|5.0|This is and excellent book for all ages, especially if you grew up reading Curious George books.  There are 399 pages full of cartoons and is easy reading for children of ages 7-12 (depending on reading level) the chapters are as is:<br /><br />1.Curious George, 1-56<br />2.Curious George Take a Job, 57-104<br />3.Curious George Rides a Bike, 106-152<br />4.Curious George Gets a Medal, 153-200<br />5.Curious George Flies a Kite, 201-280<br />6.Curious George Learns the Alphabet, 281-352<br />7.Curious George Goes to the Hospital, 353-399<br /><br />A great CURIOUS GEORGE BOOK.  YOU HAVE FOUND THE ONE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.
0312360266|1.0|I haven't finished the book because I could barely handle the ridiculous, \\"Oh my gosh!\\" theme throughout the book.  Maybe this book is good for 10-12 year olds--oh but wait, maybe it is too mature for them during the sexual (BJ) moment and other sexual and drug related moments/contents.  So that is why I'm confused, is this book for mature audiences or pre-teens?  I'm embarrassed that I purchased this book because the cashier must have thought I was nuts.  I'm too old to read a book like this and I'm not sure who I could give it to since it seems to invasive for anyone under 16.  This book was a waste of time, paper and space. Yuk!
031286504X|4.0|Not quite done with the book but so far so good (only a few chapters to go).  This is the 1st book I've read in a while.  Three kids under three doesn't allow me to read as much as I would like to. If I didn't have distractions I can tell you it would be one of those books that you wouldn't be able to put down.<br />This is worth a read IMO.
0307454541|1.0|I can't believe how bad this book is.  I couldn't get past the second chapter.  Why it's getting rave reviews is beyond me. It's confusing, it's boring, it's overrated.<br /><br />I have just read other reviews and am so grateful I'm not the only one who things it's not a good book.  I hate the idea of abuse of women (or anyone for that matter) and wonder if people just rate it high because they got a little thrill out of the explicit sex.<br /><br />So many good books to read -- I refuse to waste my time on something like this.
B001G60FVG|5.0|get ready to read the most amazing book ever! This book will blow your mind away! This book will show you how life can be so short, and how you don't appreciate people that is around you until u cant be with them.    The story starts with Susie. She's a normal girl, living life, going to school, and just being with the people who make her happy. Everything for her and her family gets worst when she is murder by her next door neighbor. As she sees her family go through pain and trouble without her, she tells us the story from the heavens above. She encounters people in heaven whom she becomes very close to as to family from earth who have died like her grandpa and their family dog. As the years go by, she realizes that sometimes we don't want things to happen, because we want them to last long, but once the problem is done, there's nothing to make everything go back to normal.
B00006CXSS|5.0|A must have for anyone interested in WWII. A very realistic depiction of events in D-Day, Market Garden, and the Battle of the Bulge, along with post war europe. along with interviews with the men who were there and survived to come home Heros to the American people!
B002VKE1K2|5.0|This film is like Blair Witch times 1000. Although I liked that film this one is sooo much more awesome in structure and everything. The characters in this story were cool. However, that guy micah really annoyed me and pissed me off. But besides that, this was a very cool and seriously scary experimental horror film. Funny story, my sister borrowed this and she was afraid of going to the bathroom at night by herself LOL. And this movie scared the living Hell outta me too. That is another reason why I loved it! This was a cool movie!

B002TSIMEC|3.0|I wanted to write, been there done that.  How many times can Robert Langdon find himself getting mixed up in some form of religious symbolic turmoil?  Still, if you forget about the previous editions and concentrate on this book alone, it is, as all of Dan Brown's books are, very entertaining.  He weaves the story, adding in factual data in such a gifted way that it keeps you turning the pages, up until the end that is.  The last thirty or so pages made me wonder why in the world I was still reading this book.<br /><br />Robert Langdon is lured to Washington DC under false pretense.  He finds himself wondering around trying to figure out where his fictitious lecture is being held, only to happen across the severed hand of his good friend and head Mason Peter Solomon.  Peter has more money than God himself so one would think his security might need a little tightening.  Still, Robert gets a mysterious phone call from his protagonist and everything starts unraveling from there.  I am not sure how much of the storyline we need to delve into at this point.<br /><br />There are lots of twists and turns, the CIA gets involved, you learn numerous facts about the capital, government structures located in Washington and interesting tidbits about our forefathers.  They were a bunch of sultry heathens it sounds like.  Not to mention those Masons.  It seems like they control the country with their bloodletting rituals of death threats and beatings.  It is exciting how many of our politicians are Masons.  I wonder how Masons can be so secretive yet our politicians can't keep their mouths shut, ever.<br /><br />As the book winds down it does throw a twist in at the end I was not expecting.  I won't divulge it at this point but it really did blow me away.  I pride myself on anticipating the unexpected and I honestly didn't see this one coming.  The sad part of the book is the ending.  After the climactic finality the book continues as it wraps up and explains \\"The Lost Symbol\\".  This could have been done in a couple of pages but it drug on for what seemed an eternity.  For such an entertaining book it left a horribly sour taste in my mouth which was unfortunate.<br /><br />Unless you have lived under a rock the last several years you have seen a movie or read a book that was influenced by Dan Brown.  You won't get anything unusual with \\"The Lost Symbol\\", but that is not always a bad thing.  You will get exactly what you expect, which is an entertaining ride down the twists and turns of a mild adventure.  I enjoyed the book as I anticipated, but absolutely hated the monotonous ramblings that formed the conclusion.in a couple of pages but it drug on for what seemed an eternity.

B0030ZOYHC|4.0|First of all, I'd like to say I've only seen the first episode of the original Neon Genesis Evangelion, and with that I can appreciate just how much work they have put into this reproduction.    Evangelion 1.11 is the final version of the first film in what looks to be 4 films covering the entirety of the original \\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\\" anime.    It's a great film that will entertain anyone who has enjoyed anime in the past. You *don't* need to be a mecha fan to enjoy this stuff because it has a much broader storyline than that.. at least from what I can tell.    Thats the only flaw of this film.. lack of solid story. It's hard to say its a particularly bad point because theres no doubt we'll be filled in with \\"Evangelion 2.22\\", the preview for it at the end of the film indicates plenty of things will happen - whereas Evangelion 1.11 just gets you started, introduces the characters, the base concepts and situation of the story. It's extremely hard to tell how much plot there is behind it.. but I can say I'll be pre-ordering Evangelion 2.22 as soon as it becomes available because at the end of this film you're left wanting more. A lot more.    The animation is fantastic, flawless on this BluRay. Audio is also brilliant (I watched with the original Japanese audio) and subtitles are clear - much nicer than subtitles ever were on DVD.    Highly recommended.
B002VHI8FE|3.0|I had a hard time making it through this book.  It was almost a collection of independent broken up short stories about  7 or 8 main characters with very little linkage between many of them until quite close to the end of the book.  The degree of development of all of these characters though is quite different.  I really didn't like many of them either. I thought it got quite a bit better near the end of the book, once they started coming together. There are still some of them though that are floating in space and haven't really been brought into the main story yet.  I was debating on whether it should be a 2 or 3 star and opted for 3 as it was good enough near the end to carry me on to the next volume.
B00005N5RM|4.0|Excellent scifi movie. I saw the first version by STEVE McQueen, but this is better(effects,technology,etc).
0393072231|5.0|I just finished reading The Big Short and I thought it was outstanding! In checking the reviews on Amazon I was struck by almost the same number of people giving it 5 stars as the number of people who gave it 1 star. This is rarely done. The book apparently brings out strong feelings on both sides of the equation. I thought Lewis did an admirable job explaining to the average person credit default swaps and how the nature of wall street and \\"traders\\" brought about one of the worst financial disasters in history. Lewis has a knack for engaging the reader in the lives and psyches of the people involved and his writing style is clear, precise , funny and always entertaining. I can't imagine how you could rate this book 1 star as several reviewers have done just because he doesn't repeat the thesis and characters prominent in Zuckerman's book. I was so engrossed in this book that I stayed up to the wee hours of the morning to finish it. As a result I now have a much clearer understanding of how the crisis occurred and of the fascinating contrarian characters who were shorting the bonds. This book will stand the test of time as Liar's Poker and Moneyball have done and will be considered one of the classics in understanding the crisis we have all been experiencing. You definitely should read it!
B002UD56I6|5.0|[[ASIN:B002UD56I6 Michael Jackson: This Is It [Blu-ray]]] This was an 'eye-opening' Video for me, whom I would definitely say was not a Jackson Fan. This video showed the tremendous Talent Jackson & his team had in putting together a great show. I hadn't realized what all the 'hoopla' was about by Jackson Fans, but now I see he was a very talented performer. \\"This is it!\\" is an excellent video not only demonstrating his Talent, but also his very caring nature. Actually, I originally purchased the Video from Amazon.com for my wife, but now I think I'm a Fan! Bob
B002RAREAK|5.0|Hats off to Usher for putting out an effort that embodies everything he was trying to say artistically and keeping his swagger on full tilt. He also pushed the limits with certain tracks like Monstar, More and OMG--and you can't help but give props to an artist who tries to push the limits and actually pull it off. I see why he had Will.I.Am and RedOne help out with the aforementioned tracks: they're the two producers behind the highest selling singles (...EVER!...) while adding his own spin to it. I've tried listening to Confessions straight trough but i can only get past the first four tracks before wanting to skip. I even liked Here I Stand, but that one wasnt consistent either. He said he put his all in this one and it's evident throughout the album. he did an excellent job!
B0035G9ABG|5.0|The Gorillaz never dissapoint and I've been listening to this album ever since it arrived. Songs like Rhinestone Eyes, Stylo, Superfast Jellyfish, On Melancholy Hill, Plastic Beach, and Pirate Jet will keep you listening to this album for years and years. After listening to the album many many times through I can say without a doubt that this will be the best album of 2010. Probably of the decade.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|I've been a fan of Quinton Tarantino's films, and \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" is one of his all-time best.  Clever, quirky, controversial, envelope-pushing - only Tarantino would have the guts to do a film \\"reinterpretation\\" of WWII.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is funny as heck as the leader to the group of Jewish-American soldiers, \\"the Basterds,\\" on a mission to kill and scalp any and every Nazi solder they find (not to mention taking a baseball bat to the skulls of captured Nazis who refuse to spill the beans), while giving those whose lives are sparred a little \\"souvenir.\\"  Tarantino hit the mother load casting Austrian actor Christolph Waltz as the Nazi \\"Jew Hunter\\" Hans Landa.  Like actress-comedienne Mo'Nique's performance in \\"Precious,\\" Waltz's turn won him every \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" award during the 2009 awards season, up to and including the Oscar, for his role in \\"Basterds.\\"  As with Mo'Nique, Mr. Waltz was deserving of the accolades, as his performance in this film is nothing short of outstanding!<br /><br />I rank \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" up there with \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and the \\"Kill Bill\\" films as film-maker Quinton Tarantino operating on all cinematic cyllinders.
B000001EUP|5.0|If there's any album from the 1980's Scorpions that you /must/ have, it's this one.<br /><br />This has the classic Scorpions sound, the one that got them all the airplay during the 80's... hard, loud, rocking. Time to blow your speakers out.<br /><br />It starts out with the title track, which is a good solid rocker, full of the 'classic' Scorpions sound with the blazing twin guitars and Klaus Meine's searing vocals. And while that is an excellent song, the album only gets better from there. The next two songs, \\"Can't Live Without You\\" and \\"No One Like You\\" actually made the radio playlists, and they're good solid rockers - great stuff. \\"You Give Me All I Need\\" starts out a little quiet, but it soon blooms into another solid rocker.<br /><br />\\"Now!\\" and \\"Dynamite\\" are the next two, and they are the loudest, heaviest songs on the album... especially \\"Now!\\", which can easily wreck your speakers. \\"Arizona\\" is a little odd, but still darn good - another classic rocker. \\"China White\\" - now that one is weird, especially the lead break... but it's still good. \\"When The Smoke Is Going Down\\" is the mellow one on the album... if you can call anything on this album 'mellow'.<br /><br />All in all, if you're looking for classic Scorpions, this is the best album to get - it's got it all, and it'll blow your speakers to hell and back. Righteous stuff.
B002VECM4A|5.0|I don't often get emotional watching movies.  However, while watching \\"Precious: Based On the Novel Push by Sapphire,\\" there was just no way for me not to.  This film grips your heart and does not let go - until long after the closing credits.<br /><br />You can read what the film is about in the description, so I won't repeat the plot here.  I will say this: the acting, direction, screenplay adaptation, soundtrack, and overall production all set a platinum standard of excellence in film-making.  To say that acting newcomer Gaborey Sidibe did a great job in her first professional acting role would be an understatement.  She knocked it out of the ballpark!  I will be very upset if I don't see her in future films, as she has definitely shown that she has the chops to succeed as an actress.<br /><br />Comedienne Mo'Nique... well... what can you say about her, except that her performance left me with emotional blisters!?  I absolutely love seeing performers known for one particular zenre (in her case, comedy) take a chance and \\"flip the script\\" on the audience by not only taking on a role that we're not used to seeing them in, but milk it for all its worth.  This is exactly what Mo'Nique does in this film; her performance is brilliant, monstrous and downright frightening all at the same time.  She didn't play it safe in this role as Mary, the welfare mother from Hell.  She went for broke and it paid off in spades.  No wonder she scooped up every \\"Best Supporting Actress\\" award in the world during the 2009 awards season leading up to her win at the Oscars.  She deserved every one of them.<br /><br />The supporting cast (including Mariah Carey, Paula Patton, Lenny Kravits, Sherri Sheppard) all beautifully contribute to one of the most heart-wrenching and heart-warming stories ever put on the silver screen.  \\"Precious\\" is high-quality film-making at its finest.
B0029O08WA|5.0|The soundtrack is great- includes a few great bands with a few new, less known ones. Great flow from song to song and it doesn't scream- TWILIGHT SOUNDTRACK!- it's just a really great compilation.     I recommend buying it!

B002NOYX54|5.0|To date, I have purchased 6 copies (one for myself, others for gifts), and I plan to buy more as friends' / family's birthdays roll around.  This project has such a powerful message of world peace that I want to share it with all of my people.  The music is AMAZING.  The documentary / backstory is INSPIRATIONAL.  You will be MOVED.
B003063HLA|4.0|This has always been and probably will always be one of my favourite all-time albums. Tracks like &#34;Everybody Wants To Rule the World&#34; and &#34;Head Over Heels&#34; will also be among my all-time favourite songs. However, overall, this album still falls short when compared with their brilliant debut &#34;The Hurting&#34;. TFF goes blatantly commercial here and succeeds overwhelmingly with this album becoming their best-selling ever. This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of the Deluxe release though is a bit of a mixed bag. As far as mlps designs go this is very average as it is poorly assembled out of thin cardboard that looks like it will come apart soon when the glue gets old which is sad given the amount of mullah they expect you to part with for this. Ironically the inner sleeve is actually better designed and assembled than the main sleeve! The sound has been remastered though and hence is an improvement over the original release. Also included are a hard cardboard square replica of the original vinyl centre circle and a fold-out with all the lyrics in Japanese and in English. There is also a very neat glossy, colour 24-page booklet with photos and an essay on the band by Paul Lester.<br /><br />There is no disputing the quality of the content though as in addition to the original track listings we get the single &#34;The Way You Are&#34; as the first track on disc 2. The other bonus tracks on the first disc are mostly filler material and unessential:<br /><br />9. The Working Hour (Piano version) - interesting but not essential<br />10.The Marauders - filler at best<br />11.Empire Building - ditto<br />12.The Big Chair - pretty interesting<br />13.Pharaohs (Single version) - just a variation of &#34;Everybody Wants To Rule The World&#34; and hence a little better than filler<br />14.When In Love With A Blind Man - just a variation of &#34;Working Hour&#34; and hence a little better than filler<br />15.Sea Song - pretty interesting musically<br />16.Broken Revisited - interesting but still filler<br /><br />The second disc is more interesting and especially for the 12&#34; tracks i.e. track numbers 8 - 12:<br /><br />1. The Way You Are - not their best work but still an interesting and enjoyable single<br />2. Mothers Talk (Short version)- okay but nothing spectacular<br />3. Shout (Edit) - like the album version but without the guitar solo so you already know that this is just filler<br />4. Everybody Wants To Rule The World (7&#34; version)<br />5. Head Over Heels (Dave Bascombe 7&#34; N. Mix)<br />6. I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording) - interesting variation of the album version<br />7. Mothers Talk (U.S. Mix) - no big deal<br />8. Shout (U.S. Remix) - pretty good<br />9. Shout (U.S. Dub Version) - very interesting variation of the album track<br />10.Everybody Wants To Rule The World (Urban Mix) - I enjoyed this one very much<br />11.Mothers Talk (Beat of the Drum Mix) - ditto<br />12.Broken/Head Over Heels/Broken (Preacher Mix)- Nice track and good way to end the deluxe release<br /><br />Overall a mixed bag as far as mlps releases go but the content in some ways makes up for this.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />UPDATED 19 Apr 2017 for Blu Ray Audio Release:<br /><br />5 stars<br /><br />The Steve Wilson Mix is a true revelation; especially the DTS HD- MA 5.1 surround mix which sounds like a whole new album.  There are sounds in the original mix that I didn't hear until Steve Wilson did his fantastic work here.  There are two other versions here: the original mix and the 2014 Stereo Mix but the DTS surround mix is by far the best sounding.  &#34;The Working Hour&#34; suddenly becomes the best track on this album with an excellent mix and so does &#34;Head Over Heels&#34;.  A major improvement on the sound quality and for me now the only way to listen to this great album.<br /><br />Very, very highly recommended for the blu ray audio DTS-HD MA 5.1 Steve Wilson mix!especially for the 12\\" tracks i.e. track numbers 8 - 12:    1. The Way You Are - not their best work but still an interesting and enjoyable single   2. Mothers Talk (Short version)- okay but nothing spectacular  3. Shout (Edit) - like the album version but without the guitar solo so you already know that this is just filler  4. Everybody Wants To Rule The World (7\\" version)  5. Head Over Heels (Dave Bascombe 7\\" N. Mix)  6. I Believe (A Soulful Re-Recording) - interesting variation of the album version  7. Mothers Talk (U.S. Mix) - no big deal  8. Shout (U.S. Remix) - pretty good   9. Shout (U.S. Dub Version) - very interesting variation of the album track  10.Everybody Wants To Rule The World (Urban Mix) - I enjoyed this one very much  11.Mothers Talk (Beat of the Drum Mix) - ditto  12.Broken/Head Over Heels/Broken (Preacher Mix)- Nice track and good way to end the deluxe release    Overall a mixed bag as far as mlps releases go but the content in some ways makes up for this.    Recommended.
B00168OIOE|4.0|Recently I bought a Blu-ray, against my own thinking because I had to get a player so might as well join the hype. Needed a Blu-ray disc to see if it was worth it so i bought a few discs including this one BECAUSE it was rated as 1 of the top 50 movies to own on Blu-ray by a number of reviewers and I saw this this movie and enjoyed it a long time ago on DVD.    It was worth it ... the detail is excellent ... and I'm no expert but I am meticulous to quality. I do not believe Blu-ray makes a big difference because the quality is in your HD tv ... I have original dvds that look just as good on a Blu-ray playing on the same tv. Don't be fooled, Blu-ray isn't automatically better. Your tv makes a difference.    That being said, this Blu-ray is worth it ... quality is improved over a dvd disc.
B003063HII|4.0|I have to admit that I didn't take to this album right away when I first heard it. It's fine for you guys who were introduced to TFF through this album but for guys like me who were blown away by \\"The Hurting\\" and impressed by \\"Songs...Chair\\", this album represented a big shift musically from what we were used to.<br /><br />For one, we had for the first time, a vocal soloist who plays an MVP role in the first 2 tracks in the great Oleta Adams. We also had jazz influences in major doses! Add to that a clear departure from their very original sound evidenced on \\"The Hurting\\" and evolving on \\"Songs...Chair\\" to a mish mash of said jazz and The Beatles' \\"I Am the Walrus\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" days as we get a clear attempt by TFF to experiment with genre's and past bands that had influenced them.<br /><br />Once fans like me, assuming they could get over this major style change, decided to forget the first two albums and to judge this one on its own merits, it became clear that this was indeed a good album with very interesting songwriting and musical ideas. One thing that thankfully still remained from at least \\"The Hurting\\" days is the guys' still writing lyrics that touched on social and political issues.<br /><br />\\"Woman in Chains\\" covered gender discrimination, \\"Badman's Song\\" covered religious bigotry and hypocrisy, \\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\" covered Roland's political beliefs and his anti-Tory pro-Labour stance and a nostalgic look back to the late 60's \\"flower-power\\" scene. My favourite track, \\"Advice to the Young at Heart\\" covered the need for young adults to painfully albeit reluctantly but necessarily face up to the responsibilities of \\"growing up\\" and moving on to the next phase of life.<br /><br />TFF then take our attention to the plight of the majority of our brethren on our planet who suffer greatly while we live in blissful ignorance/\\"don't give a damn\\" attitudes. The last 3 tracks cover the violence in the world and the inevitable outcome this brings.  For those new to TFF, if you want to get the best these guys have ever done, get the first 3 albums.<br /><br />As far as mlps designs go this is very average as it is poorly assembled out of thin cardboard that looks like it will come apart soon when the glue gets old which is sad given the amount of mullah they expect you to part with for this. Ironically the inner sleeve is actually better designed and assembled than the main sleeve! The sound has been remastered though and hence is an improvement over the original release. Also included are a hard cardboard square replica of the original vinyl centre circle and a fold-out with all the lyrics in Japanese and in English and an essay on the band by Richard Smith.<br /><br />There is no disputing the quality of the content although in addition to the original track listings we get bonus tracks that are mostly filler material and unessential:<br /><br />9. Tears Roll Down - interesting but not one of their better works<br />10.Always in the Past - uninspiring<br />11.Music for Tables - filler<br />12.Johnny Panic and the Bible of Dreams - pretty poor filler<br /><br />Overall a mixed bag as far as mlps releases go but the quality original album content in some ways makes up for this.<br /><br />Recommended.want to get the best these guys have ever done, get the first 3 albums.

B0036EBARO|5.0|Goldfrapp has released some of the most interesting pop music in the last decade.  They've explored warm electronica, electro, glam rock, disco and acoustic folk.  They are also a very intelligent band who uses their knowledge of their musical influences to their advantage (as opposed to simply making music which is a rip off of legends).  They create exciting, new music which is retro in nature - and they do it very well.    'Head First' sounds like it could have been released in the 1980s.  When I hear this album, I feel like I've experienced a time warp and I am back in the 80s - the era of Dynasty, shoulder pads, bright colors and synthesizers gallore.  This album is such a guilty pleasure!    \\"Rocket\\" reminds me of Van Halen's \\"Jump,\\" while \\"Alive\\" steers into Olivia Newton-John's 'Xanadu' era.  The title track brings to mind ABBA, and sounds like a marriage of \\"I Have A Dream\\" and \\"The Visitors.\\"  \\"Hunt\\" manages to combine 'Touch' era Eurythmics moody synths, along with a splash of Laurie Anderson and David Bowie (think \\"O Superman\\" and \\"Loving The Alien\\").  And speaking of Bowie, \\"Dreaming\\" recalls his 1985 collaboration with the Pat Metheney Group, \\"This Is Not America.\\"      Overall, this is a glorious addition to Goldfrapp's amazing catalogue.  If you love Goldfrapp, the 1980s and synth pop - you'll love this.

0312370849|5.0|A story with the Jewish-Nazi theme, however with a twist.  The focus of the story is not so much what the Nazi regime did in France but what the French government did in 1942 towards it Jewish population.  The style of the story is well done.  Its back and forth from 1942 to the present keeps the reader attentive and one does not want to put the book down.  The story has two heroines.  One lives a severe tragic life, the other sets out to discover how was her tragic life connected to her.  I relished the plot but probably the French people would be embarassed by it.  Some today, would not know about the Jewish round-up of '42.  Truthfully I didn't.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|For just over a $100, you couldn't ask for more. It is a great flash that is compact, easy to use, and delivers the extra light desired. It also has the ability to bounce the flash, which is great for fill light. I would recommend the Sto-Fen diffuser. It is a little expensive, considering it's just a $.25 piece of plastic... but it can make a big difference in some shooting situations. It won't fulfill your wildest dreams, but it will do it's job. I would highly recommend this flash. For the price, it can't be beat. And third party flashes are crap, so don't even bother. Just buy the Nikon, and you'll love it. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this flash at all. Well constructed, and takes normal AA batteries, which can be easily replaced wherever you are.
1408460300|2.0|It took me 3 days to read this book. By the page 200 I knew exactly how it was going to end. I just read it fast to make sure I was right. And I was: 100%. But it was better than Deception Point, since I couldn't read more than 40 pages of the book. He uses the same formula, it's like reading The Da Vinci Code with just a different scenario. Solomon x Sauniere, Silas x Mal'akh. No creativiy!Do you know that Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh (again?) wrote a book about the FreeMasons: \\"The Temple and The Lodge\\"? [[ASIN:1559701269 The Temple and the Lodge]]. As Einstein said: \\"The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources\\".

B000089RVR|5.0|I love this cd. The whole cd has wonderful rythyms and Dido sings so powerfully. Some tracks on the cd had a feel very reminiscent of the classic disco diva, Donna Summer, for me. I can listen to the whole cd and find myself repeating them. Truly beautiful. I will purchase her other cd's in the near future. Bravo, Dido!
0743578171|5.0|I got the audio book faster than expected which was nice. One I started listening I found it hard to stop. Im the person who is a great starter but often dont finish reading books so the audio book was fun and exciting to listen to and I didnt have to do the work, also reading often put me to sleep so thats another great reason the audio book was perfect for me. This audio book offered lots of insite and I think it should be in every teenagers home library as their bible to live by. I found the content of this audio book very helpful in helping me to put down that old baggage and walk away. I totally recommend this product and the price was fantastic... totally worth the money.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Rebuild of Evangelion is a must buy for any fans of the original Evangelion. The production quality, once the worst part of Eva what with their budget issues, is now phenomenal! Some of the original voice cast is back (Shinji, Misato, word is out on Asuka since she's not in this one) and the replacements are all quite good, they just take a little getting used to (Kensuke and Gendo in particular).    Anyway, if you're a fan of Eva, buy this. Buy this now. Don't bother with rebuild 1.01, it's on disc 2 of 1.11. Enjoy the high definition defeat of the first three angels and ponder at the changes to Tokyo 3.
B001LPWGE6|5.0|The Bourne series is amazing! Matt Damon is at his best here and there couldn't have been a better choice for Jason Bourne. All 3 films are action packed with some good gunplay, fist fights, and car chases and they never seem to get old. If your a fan of a good spy/espionage movies than this is for you!  Only complaint I have is that the price is a bit high. I have seen this trilogy in stores for OVER $100!! who is paying this??? Even amazon's price of $65 makes each film almost $22. If the price  could get into the $35-$40 range i would give the Bourne Trilogy 6 stars if possible!!!!!

The only way that I get anything done is by following the excellent advice from Brian Tracy on prioritizing tasks and setting goals.

B0009HLD0K|5.0|My absolute favorite movie. Anyone who is a fan of cycling will love this movie. Certainly worth watching, well directed and great acting. I don't know what else to say, its just great!
B0031S4K5E|5.0|package arrived quickly as always. Movie is really good. This was the only way my daughter could get the stuffed Ponyo, otherwise might have gotten the Blu-ray. This movie is right in line with other Hayao Miyazaki films. He is the master of these family friendly films.
B000C13Y2S|5.0|These little lights are proving great as extra light sources for my table top macro studio.  Removing the keyring lets them stand stably, and the adjustable head angle makes for great little spotlights. The LED gives a nicely neutral white light which serves me well for this use.
B002VKB0M4|3.0|This movie is very French; little resolution tempered with a healthy dose of depression. I purchased it because I love Paris. You do get to see quite a bit of the lovely city-so it has that going for it. Otherwise, this movie is only for die-hard French cinema fans (I enjoyed it, my husband hated it; I speak French, he doesn't).
0061807400|5.0|this is a good read. Although there is quite a bit of foreshadowing...I still enjoyed it.
B002BSHXJA|2.0|This collection does not include the song Henry the Eighth. If you are looking for that song it is mysteriously absent from the collection. The other songs I could take or leave. I listened to them all once, would not listen again.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Pretty much the best Guy movie ever made (my opinion). Can't go wrong with this movie.
0793518326|3.0|I was really looking forward to this as I had been given a copy of one song by a friend.  The scores are really accurate and complete and having both notation and tab is great.      However, when I got it the size of the page was smaller than the one I had been given originally and, apparently, when the publisher shrunk it down to fit a smaller page they did not do a very good job of reproducing it.  The tab is cramped, hard to read and the print is kind of darkish gray rather than black.      It is still good to have this in one document and it is usable (I guess), but it almost makes me consider that I might have done better for myself if I had gotten the pirate version off bittorrent that was recommended to me.  It would not be fair to pirate something that took so much work to pull together and publish, I think, but on the other hand it is not fair for the publisher to sell an inferior version of the material.
B00000IBVC|5.0|The definitive production with lavish sets and costumes, amazing setting and fabulous voices. Puccini's opera comes to life. We have watched and listened to this many times and it never disappoints. If you don't know this opera you will love its romantic and stirring music.
B002SF9YNO|4.0|I have a different interpretation than most Americans watching this film. I think it's about the outcasts in Japanese society called the Burakumin. The Burakumin typically tan leather and deal with the dead, occupations that are seen as somehow unclean in Japan. Hence the cellist taking a job with the funeral director is also accepting a huge loss of status. This is why his wife and neighbors are so upset at his new occupation. By showing the care taken by the funeral director, the movie is arguing for the humanity of the Burakumin.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|I saw the new lead singer for Alice in Chains at Rock on the Range in Columbus OH well before the release of this album so as soon as it was released on CD at Amazon it went on my Christmas list! I love this album. I hope they re-release some of the older tracks with the new lead singer providing vocals. His live rendition of Man in the Box sent chills up my spine because it was so good.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this love story as well as the period costumes and scenery. It was well acted and definately worth the price. I would recommend this to anyone who likes these types of movies.
B00275EGWY|2.0|I can accept that film makers take some dramatic licence to make the plot work, but in a modern war film, the plot line has to be realistic or the movie just becomes ridiculous and scene after scene in the Hurt Locker are just not believable. This started in the opening scene, where the sophisticated robot is pulling a flimsy handcart that falls apart at the first obstacle. The worst scene has to be the sniper scenario, where an incompetent British SAS team is wiped out by Iraqi snipers from 800 yards using AK47's and the heroic Americans promptly show that they are also trained snipers, capable of hitting a moving target at nearly 1000 yards range! The movie can only go downhill from here and of course it does, with a ridiculous scene where our hero goes out after dark in combat fatigues on a futile mission to try and find \\"Beckham's\\" killers and then calmly walks through Baghdad without getting a scratch. Then we have the strange episode of the reluctant suicide bomber, who the insurgents have encased in explosives and put in the middle of the town square. When Rambo arrives, the first thing he sees is a watch hanging from the bomb that says, \\"I'm going off in 2 minutes, please keep away\\"!     Honestly, how can rubbish like this possibly garner 6 Oscars including the top awards. One can only imagine what the rest of the competition must have been like.
B000009RNM|5.0|This is more for the casual Bowie fan who wants everything or at least the best of Bowie from this period. This is what I was after at least - all the classics from \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\", \\"Ziggy Stradust\\", \\"Jean Genie\\", \\"Diamond Dogs\\"<br />As far as I am concerned a great little package in on nice neat cd without having to spend a fortune.
B000UAFDP2|1.0|I very much enjoyed this movie, and even more so enjoyed Heinlein's book.  I have the movie on Laser and on regular DVD.  However, the Blu Ray version will not play on a brand new Sony Blu Ray player, though this machine plays dozens of other Blu Ray films faultlessly. The vendor (through Amazon Marketplace) even gave me another copy which behaved the same way in the machine. So, I don't know what to say. I like the film and the book and my original DVD copy---have any of you had trouble with the Blu Ray version?
B0036CWK8O|4.0|I've had this album for around 2 months now as it was released much earlier on Amazon UK. - the bad thing about getting it early was that I missed out on getting the bonus track `Why' which was included here.<br />From a personal viewpoint, I wasn't all that pleased when I saw the track listing, but we all have different favourites.<br />The interest is in how they reworked/rearranged the songs. Across the album you'll find on different tracks: a 70-piece orchestra; a choir; guest musicians; and even kids!<br /><br />Personal Highlights:<br /><br />The sound quality - absolutely awesome when played loud through a decent sound system.<br />The production is crystal clear -If I Could Fly is a definite highlight with Deris staring here - his new more limited than before vocal range suits this track perfectly.<br />Future World works really well and includes a surprisingly entertaining short percussion passage near the end.<br />The Keeper's Trilogy is awesome. Have a listen to the high-intensity orchestration come in after the quiet intro to the `King For A thousand Years' section - unbelievable! Ala the James Bond `Live And Let Die' type of excitement. Sonically, it works as well as when the guitars & drums come crunching in on the original version of 'King...'.<br />Perfect Gentleman - before I had even heard the album, I couldn't picture this track working very well in another format and ended up pleasantly surprised. - the lyrics are much clearer on this version.<br /> The priceless version of Falling To Pieces blew me away from the first bar. It's at least as good as the original. It's very rare when you have a great song and then an alternate version which is different but equally as good. The word `beautiful' probably best describes this rendition with another well-suited vocal by Deris..<br />What almost works perfectly is I Want Out. Deris delivers it well enough and kids do the backing vocals which is okay but it's a bit of an overkill as in `Another Brick In The Wall Pt. 2'. Kids are okay but I prefer dogs. Still very catchy though.<br />Musically, this upbeat Dr Stein is very catchy with the brass addition & backing vocals, but I don't think Deris's vocals quite work throughout the track. In fact, his new vocal range sounds uncomfortable at times and does drag the album down a notch although still very good to excellent in certain songs or sections of songs. The guy has been one of my favorite vocalists in the past with his passionate delivery but I think nearly all my other favorite male vocalists (Plant / Gillan / Halford) have all come across problems with their vocals as they have aged.<br /><br />The DVD is well put together with interviews about how they made the project come together. The guys do come across as being likeable and down to earth.<br />It also contains a typically loaded Helloween-style film clip of Dr Stein.<br />There is one thing that bothers me: how could they call this a 'best of' when it's clearly just a re-working of some of their songs in another format backed by outside guests?? - kind of like Page/Plants Unledded album.<br /><br />Overall, the album is brilliant most of the time but doesn't always work. The usage of the special guests is extremely effective (apart from the kids).<br />Helloween stated on the DVD that they were very proud of their achievement and that it wasn't an easy project by any means. Their great effort is very rewarding.<br />I'm definitely glad they released this and I don't miss the hard-edge of the originals when I'm in chill-out mode.<br /><br />Would I recommend this to Helloween newcomers? Maybe. I'd firstly recommend any album apart from Pink Bubbles, Chameleon, and Rabbit, which I still like enough anyway. Get this after you know the original versions, or if you don't particularly like hard rock - the songs stand alone in any format - so yeah, knock yourself out.dogs. Still very catchy though.

B000F9RB9Y|3.0|A new PS3 slim was our family Xmas gift and we purchased a number of Blu-Ray movies that we already had on regular DVD to go with it. This was one of those movies and am disappointed to say that the age of the movie takes very little advantage of the outstanding quality of Blu-Ray.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|This is a great item for watch novices looking for a nice piece to compliment business/formal attire. I've had this mistaken for a Rolex Daytona a few times, which is always nice. A few things I've noticed that allude to the lower price point:    - The Cronograph markings on the bezel are slightly offset, with the 0 marker about half minute increment off from 12 o'clock  - After owning the watch for 6 months, the second (stopwatch) hand resets to about the 58th minute marker after the knob is pulled to reset the date/time (this is remedied by running the stopwatch for 2 seconds, then leaving it there...a little annoying)  - I feel like the watch has lost a few minutes accuracy over the 3 years I've had it, but I never took the time to test it.     Those things aside, the watch has nice details like screw down knobs, and Invicta logos impressed into the clasp and middle knob for that added touch. I've had mine for about 3 years now and will probably replace it. Money well spent.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I LOVED this album!   It is mellow, soothing, and beautiful.   I can't stop playing it.  It fills my soul.   I hope she doesn't wait another 10 years to release her next album.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Features some of their best playing. The vocals of Cloverdale and Hughes work beautifully together and put anything Ian Gillan ever did to shame. The songs are strong - not a single dud here amongst them. The arrangements sound tighter and the tunes have great riffs and solos without getting lost in the haze. Very economical sounding - no endless doodling here as each riff, solo and vocal exchange seems to have a distinct purpose. This is definitely a classic, must have hard rock album that no hr fan should be without.
B0027BOL4G|1.0|One shouldn't get to complain about having wasted time and money on a propaganda piece when the packaging already states a disclaimer: \\"From the company that brought you An Inconvenient Truth\\"    But complain I will.    This \\"documentary\\" is a brainwash session prepared by and for people who have blinders on. Like any true propaganda film, facts are mixed with inaccuracies and incomplete information, so that the viewer is left with a wrong impression of reality, or an unstated blatant lie.    An example of incomplete information is the treatment of corn, and how it's used by Big Bad Businesses. The movie presents corn as the source of American obesity, without regard to the countless studies that show that primary causes for obesity are a dramatic increase in caloric intake and lack of exercise. The standard applied to causality between corn and obesity is such that one could equally well say that spoons are the cause for obesity in America.    Strangely the \\"documentary\\" has no actual scientific experts offering opinions, perhaps because such interviews were not deemed necessary, or their content ran contrary to whatever agenda the producers have.    One underlying tone is that Big Bad Corporations are out to get the farmer and the consumer, and that they are enabled by Bad Evil People, such as anyone appointed by President GW Bush. The producers don't seem to find it inconvenient to gloss over the fact that agricultural policies and the Big Bad Corporations depicted go back decades, not just the 8 years from 2001 to 2008, and that appointees of Presidents Clinton and Carter are of necessity engaging in the same Bad Evil activities.    In short, save your money and time, unless you like your blinders firmly planted right where they are.
B002RAREAK|5.0|from myBlog [...] (go check it out!)<br /><br />...Usher's 6th studio album \\"Raymond v. Raymond\\" will be released March 30th, and I'm so proud to report that this one is worth the purchase. 2008's \\"Here I Stand\\", had Usher playing the \\"devoted husband and father\\" role and I think the album and it's promotion suffered because of it. Not a terrible album by any means, but his live performances were severely lacking and his interviews became intolerable with him trying to convince everybody how much in Love with his new wife he was. And than just a few months after that album dropped it was announced that he was getting a divorce. This album starts off by making the point \\"there are three sides to every story. One side. The Other Side. and The Truth\\" and the rest of album seems to just point out the different sides and doesn't really seem to deal with the truth. However that's not a complaint, because pretty much everything about this album is great. Just on a production level, this is one of his best albums. The various producers ranging from Jim Jonsin to Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis offer Usher tracks with so much depth and complexity. Even though the album sticks to what Usher is good at, R&B, there is a good bit of diversity on the album as far as it's tracks. And even on the Dance/Pop'ish tracks it's not just the typical and lazy repeated loop of a keyboard sequence, there's always something new coming up with each minute on each song.<br />Lyrically it's also very on point, as I keep listening and noticing clever lines and even some thought provoking ones. The albums BEST (yeah I said it!) track \\"Mars v. Venus\\" is a great example, where he uses space travel and astronomy terms to equate with sex and love. \\"Pro Lover\\" is another well-written track, you might miss the genius of the lyrics at first because the track is so fun and his vocal delivery is so creative, but listen to the lyrics on the second go round. Throughout the album, like I said before, he shows the different sides of what can make a marriage go south. And I definitely appreciate that he's not blaming anybody, (well at least not on every track), he accepts his part and also acknowledges how the female in the relationship might feel. It's a really well-rounded album lyrically.<br />And Vocally, Usher is on fire on this album. The lead in track \\"Monstar\\" almost doesn't even sound like him, his vocals are way more relaxed and even conversational on this Disco inspired track. And even though \\"Foolin' Around\\" plays like \\"Burn part Two\\", his vocals actually save what might be considered a dated track. The difference from this album from the last album vocally is Usher seems to be a lot more present and determined to let his voice be the star even though he has A+ tracks to sing over. He plays with his voice in so many different ways, and truly shows that he does have some major talent outside of his dance skills.<br />I can't wait to see some Live performances from him to show if he's Really back, but this album is a winner. There's really not a bad track on the album, and even if certain songs have things lacking, the amazing production lyrics or vocals save it from floundering.es of what can make a marriage go south.

B002VECM4A|5.0|Once a movie or book has garnered a significant number of reviews I always read the one and two star reviews to try and assess why a minority of people feel so strongly that a work is so overwhelmingly bad as to merit the ultimate negative reviews.  With Precious there is an interesting trend (or trendlet?)of dissing the movie for being depressing.  This should hardly come as a surprise to anyone who's read or heard anything about it before seeing it.  Of course it is!  And avoiding being reminded of the more distressing aspects of life does nothing to dispel the realities for all too many people.  Precious is not, contrary to one negative review, thoroughly unlikable, rather she is shielded and guarded by a fantasy life from the worst moments of inescapable misery and horror.  She lives entirely in her fantasies as an escape, dissociating herself from that which she cannot literally remove herself.  She has no friends, no adequate defenses, and only the hope to be found in her technicolored rock star/supermodel dreams.      I find it interesting that the negative reviews completely avoid the obvious: Precious is a film about the ultimate stereotypical Welfare denizens, poor, Black, and multi-generational losers mooching professionally off the system and wanting nothing else.  There is a significant segment of our society who would clasp this film to its collective bosom whilst chanting \\"See?  Like them!\\"  Veddy in-te-res-tinck.  But the film is more than that; it is a powerful example of the impact a little attention and effort to reach out to those who hurt can accomplish.  No, the movie doesn't end with flowers and rainbows everywhere, it ends with a wan ray of hope shining in the dark.  In the end, Precious escapes her hopeless prison by deciding she will define herself.  One can only hope she manages to do so, against all odds.

B001GSV3EC|5.0|So how do you rank great guitar players?  By style, personal musical preference, media coverage?  I suppose that's an individual's prerogative.  I know many non-musicians who rank players by reputation and sometimes that's not accurate, especially with Eric Clapton, who is the world's most overrated guitarist in this guitar player's opinion.<br />  I would have to classify by overall depth and just plain personality, and for my money, the greatest guitarist of all time was Chet Atkins.  Nobody had a broader understanding of music in general, all styles and history.  For my money, Jeff Beck is the greatest living guitarist, and one of very few, if any, true peers of Jimi Hendrix.  It is well known that Hendrix marveled at Beck's work with the Jeff Beck Group and his landmark album \\"Truth\\".<br />  However, because Jeff chose to record when and how he preferred, never considering massive commercial appeal, his reputation has been somewhat limited to the musical community, but in that sense, that same reputation is much higher than just about anybody else, including Van Halen, Steve Vai or Joe Satriani.  The problem with these type of players was a lack of depth and reliance on overkill and endless wanking that made them ultimately boring after a while.<br />  Jeff has never succumbed to the wanker mentality, nor, as Van Halen, has he abused drugs and alcohol to the point of nearly killing his talent.  As \\"Performing This Week  . . .\\" demonstrates, Beck doesn't merely play - he feels every note, and every sound he coaxes from his axe is under complete control with a delicate touch unparalleled in music today.  Jazzy, noisy, metallic, symphonic, bluesy - all melt into a style only a true master could create.<br />  Every tune is great, with highlights including Tal Wilkenfeld's great bass solo on \\"Because We've Ended As Lovers\\", the furious \\"Scatterbrain\\" and \\"Led Boots\\", and the whammy and slide work of \\"Angels(Footsteps)\\" and the set closer, his now classic \\"Where Were You\\".  The sound is great, the band smokes, and once again guitarists should meekly return their instruments to the pawn shop or get to serious work if they ever hope to even glimpse at the heights this great man has already achieved.  A no excuse for not owning CD if there ever was one.classic \\"Where Were You\\".

B000002KAG|5.0|I bought this album in 1967 at a Woolworth's cutout rack for $1.99. I was enthralled with what was happening in San Francisco at the time, and any band that released a disc was on my turntable. When I got it home, the Ramones-like pace was an unexpected blast into the center of my brain and ignighted all the nerves & synaps in my teenybopper body. I still connect to it the same way many, many, many (did I say many?) years later. I smile remembering the cheesy organ rave up & the first chords to \\"Golden Road to Unlimited Devotion\\". Par-ty ev-ver-ery day! (Full disclosure: I'm more of a Nuggets garage punk kind of gal. I didn't really \\"get\\" the Dead beyond the first four albums until I was middle aged.)

B0030Y11XS|5.0|Michael Moore has made one of his best documentaries so far, showing how the criminal Wall Street bankers performed their \\"financial coup d'&eacute;tat\\" in 2008.<br /><br />To begin with, under Reagan, they pushed the deregulation process.  One of the best scenes of this movie is the chairman of Merrill Lynch saying to Reagan while he was actually delivering a speech : \\"you have to speed it up\\".  It is one of those very rare instants when you actually see who is acting and who is in control !  After the Wall Street boys got their deregulation, they invented all kind of new ways to make money in their insane casino, one of them being called \\"derivatives\\".  Moore asked some Wall Street gurus, including a Harvard professor, to have us explained what a \\"derivative\\" is, and neither of them succeeded.  And that's exactly the point.  Make it complicated, and project high returns, and no questions will be asked.<br /><br />The banks made a home run.  They got in trouble, but taxpayers were invited to pay for it.  In 2008, Bush used the old trick of 9/11 again, and used *fear* to orchestrate what Moore calls a \\"financial coup d'&eacute;tat\\".  Two months before election, we were told by the mass media that \\"the economy would collapse\\" if banks were not saved.  That was a major fraud.  Through a backdoor agreement involving the president and the president-to-be, an agreement was reached to inject $700 billion of tax money in the criminal banks.<br /><br />In the meantime, people have lost their houses, and are still losing them, at a flabbergasting rate of every 7.5 seconds !  Moore makes an important point when showing how the middle class lived 30 to 40 years ago : one wage-earner was enough to support a whole family, own a house, have a car, take yearly vacations, have health care, could rely on a pension, etc.  This model looks from a distant past, although it was part... of our childhood !  Wages have been in steady decline since the 80's, and pensions and health care have been privatized.  In the process, the middle class is virtually ruined.<br /><br />Citibank calls what's left of the US democracy a \\"plutonomy\\".  Following their definition this is an economy \\"powered by and for the benefit of the wealthy\\".  Following the same memo, the top 1 % of the American households has more wealth than the bottom 95% combined.  Moore also highlights the fact that this memo considers \\"the most potent and mayor threat is societies demanding a more \\"equitable\\" share of the wealth\\".<br /><br />If the economic system fails and if the democracy is not working at all, then maybe it's time to go back to the essence of honest business and real democracy.  One of the solutions highlighted by Michael Moore are cooperatives, where the pay is fairly distributed, and decisions are made together.  As complementary reading, I would recommend John Abram's [[ASIN:160358000X Companies We Keep (Revised & Expanded): Employee Ownership and the Business of Community and Place]].<br /><br />The Extras on this DVD - with some interesting interviews - highlight another solution : CSA (community supported agriculture).  The way out of insanity is definitively empowering local communities.the middle class is virtually ruined.    Citibank calls what's left of the US democracy a \\"plutonomy\\".

Ich verstehe die schlechten kritiken überhaupt nicht, in Deutschland obwohl der erste teil dort Verboten ist gibt es eine riesige Fan gemeinde, weil der erste und auch zweite Teil der Serie einfach Genial ist.

B001HN694K|4.0|As an \\"Alice\\" purist I generally cringe at the assortment of attempts to adapt either of Lewis Carroll's works \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and/or \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" to the movie screen.  These have been of varying quality but even the best are no more than satisfactory (\\"Dreamchild\\" being an exception but it was more about the real Alice than about the Wonderland Alice).     But I had a pretty good idea what I was getting into before shelling out the bucks to see this Burton effort in 3-D.  I knew that despite what many have said and despite its title, this is not an adaptation of Carroll's books.  Accordingly I knew that this would greatly increase my toleration level.   They could do what they liked with the traditional characters and play around with whatever sort of plot elements intrigued them; I would not take particular offense.    That said I had no real problem with anything about the film.   In Burton and writer Linda Woolverton's story, Alice revisits Wonderland/The Looking Glass House 13 years after waking up from her original dreams.  Alice, now almost 20, is attending her sister's garden party, which she discovers is intended to be her engagement party.  Cringing at a marriage proposal from the unappealing son of her father's former business partner, she runs from the party and follows a white rabbit down an immense hole.    Her seemingly endless fall is arguably the best scene of the film and is by far the best Hollywood has ever assembled; even including a slick twist at the bottom where her hair is standing on end.  Then she repeats the drink-me eat-me shrinking-growing bit from the book.  And these two sequences are pretty much the only thing other than the characters that come directly out of the book.  One advantage of having a 20-year-old Alice is that her clothes do not shrink or grow with her size changes.  She must improvise on each occasion and this adds a touch of physical comedy to the transformations.     For her part Alice seems to have suppressed the memory of her two childhood dreams, showing little familiarity with the characters she is meeting for a second time (in some cases a third time).  And initially they are unsure that she is the same Alice who visited them over a decade earlier.  But for the white rabbit, the dormouse, the Tweedles, and the smoking caterpillar she has be the right Alice because they have lured her back to fulfill a prophecy.  It has been foretold that  Alice will slay the Jabberwocky (a dragon worthy of the lizards in the old 50's sci-fi films) with a magical sword.   This will change the balance of power, with the good White Queen getting the crown from the wicked Red Queen. We've seen this thing before, insert: \\"Narnia, Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings\\" here. And they throw in a few visuals from \\"The Neverending Story\\" series.     Ultimately Alice goes all \\"Joan of Arc\\" or at least \\"Jane and the Dragon\\" and becomes a knight in armor.  Many have lamented this action adventure turn of the story but the actual showdown takes only about 10 minutes so I don't think it is that big of a deal.  And it has some considerable basis as Alice had been the White Queen's Pawn (because the Queen's daughter Lily was too young to play) throughout the chess match in \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". That story was just one big chess game with a lengthy combat segment between the White Knight and the Red Knight, as well as a fight between the \\"Gladstone\\" Lion and the \\"Disraeli\\" Unicorn for the crown.  The only problem I see is that the combat is all too predictable.    Mia Waisikowska strikes a perfect balance as the title character, playing the bravest heroine in literary history requires a lot of nonverbal stuff and she sells her reluctance nicely along with giving her character a subtle sensual dimension.    Helena Bonham Carter pretty much steals the film, although she is upstaged on occasion by the grinning Cheshire cat.   Depp's Mad Hatter never quite comes into focus, playing the character as a schizophrenic (at least that's what I assume he was doing) introduced a little too much pain into this type of story; in much the same way that his take on Willy Wonka just brought the viewer down.  A run-of-the-mill lunatic would worked better.    As the White Queen, Anne Hathaway was pretty much irrelevant and was most likely cast because of her \\"small\\" head (her features seem to take up her entire face-especially with the extreme make-up),  a kind of good-guy bad-guy balance for her evil sister's big head.   But I did like the off-kilter Morticia Addams take she gave her character; rather than playing her as a goody-two-shoes.      The audience during my showing was attentive and entertained from beginning to end (well almost to the end as the film goes out on a couple of extremely weak scenes back on the surface).  But most bolted before the closing credits, which played over Avril Lavigne singing \\"Alice\\" (Avril also appears in the film's trailer).   Given that it is mostly up-scale theaters with state-of-the-art sound systems showing this film, those who left missed one of the best moments of the whole viewing experience.  Not unlike those who missed the great closing credits animation sequences at the end of \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\".    Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.    Trippin out  Spinning around  I'm underground  I fell down  Yeah I fell down    I'm freaking out, where am I now?  Upside down and I can't stop it now  Can't stop me now, oh oh    I, I'll get by  I, I'll survive  When the world's crashing down  When I fall and hit the ground  I will turn myself around  Don't you try to stop me  I, I won't cry    I found myself in Wonderland   Get back on my feet, on the ground  Is this real?  Is this pretend?  I'll take a stand until the end    I, I'll get by  I, I'll survive  When the world's crashing down  When I fall and hit the ground  I will turn myself around  Don't you try to stop me  I, I won't cry    I, I'll get byI, I'll survive  When the world's crashing down  When I fall and hit the ground  I will turn myself around  Don't you try to stop me  I, and I won't cry

Genius is really the only way to describe her level of talent.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This is a show that only gets better with time.  Every season the writers find new and creative ways to keep us coming back.  We all knew that Dean would not stay in hell forever, and I was very curious how he would get out.  Never did I imagine that in addition to all the demons and ghosts we would have angels too.    This season the main story line revolves around the book of revelations in the bible.  The demons are breaking the 66 seals nessasary to raise Lucifer from hell, and the angels are supposedly trying to stop it.  It turns out that while Dean was in hell, he broke the first seal and put everything in motion.    Dean, Sam and Bobby are working their hardest, along side the angel Castiel, to prevent the seals from breaking, but are not haveing much luck.  It turns out that some of the angels want lucifer to rise in order to force a battle that they are convinced that they can win.  The entire season is not completly dedicated to the angels and demons storylines.  It would not be Supernatural if it did not include a few episodes mixed in that make us laugh.  My 2 favorites are Wishfull Thinking, and Yellow Fever.  Wishfull Thinking involves residents of a town whose every wish is being granted via a wishing well in a chinese resturant.  The only problem is that the wishes go bad.  Dean test it out, and wishes for a sandwich, only to get food poisoning from it, and a little girl wishes for her teddy bear to become real and life size, only to get life size teddy that drinks all day, steals porn, and tries to commit suicide because he feels that life has no meaning.  Yellow fever involves a new twist on the tradional ghost story.  Dean and Sam head to a town where healthy residents are droping dead of heart attacks.  It turns out that they are infected with ghost sickness, which makes them afraid of everything, extremely paranoid, and will die after 3 days unless they scare the ghost into exercising itself.  Dean winds up infected and there is an extemely entertaining moment of him running down the street in fear of his life from a small dog with a pink bow in its hair.  The season finale does a grerat job of wrapping up the season and setting up the next season.  We also find out the full truth about Ruby, and she gets what has been long coming to her.  The only real sour note is the ongoing storyline of Sam being addicted to demon blood.  I thought that was a little to crazy even for this show.    The dvd extras are a little thin, but I recommend that everyone pick up this season.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Hey, there used to be reviews of this album but they've disappeared, as have the ratings. Most of them were in the 4 & 5 star range.<br />The album is a success, and the music is pure Harrison. In the midst of life changing events George Harrison was writing the music that would mark the end of his career and his life on this earth.  It's riveting and emotional, and for a long time I avoided it because it was such a deep and penetrating piece of work.<br />Now I cherish it for it's honesty and complexity.  George Harrison didn't skimp when it came to his opinions, and his observations about (his)life and the never ending search for God are as evident here as they were on Living In The Material World, with the added wisdom of the sage that he had become.<br />If you are already a George fan, don't miss this fine album that is full of beautiful melody, thoughtful and sometimes whimsical lyrics, and the expected mesmerizing slide guitar that he perfected.<br />If you're new to his music and considering this, be prepared for a luxurious musical experience. George was a classic, and this solidifies his place in modern music's hall of fame.
B002VECMAE|2.0|Twenty-five years ago, I perused an issue of International Combat Arms - a strange stew of well-researched articles worthy of Janes combined with, well, crackpot journalism.  Among the strangest articles was one on Soviet research into \\"psionic warfare,\\" and the U.S. Military's attempts to match it.  \\"Goats\\" is a satire based on a non-fiction book about the once-classified program.<br /><br />Viewers expecting a laugh-out-loud farce are advised to spend their money elsewhere.  Trailers endlessly feature George Clooney's character killing a goat through thought-power to imply that this movie is a comedy, but it's not.  In typically satirical fashion, the film sneers at both the Cold War hysteria which led to this program, and the New Age/Hippie philosophies which the program was supposed to investigate.  \\"Goats'\\" tone is only mildly amusing, with a lot of maudlin moments mixed in.  Casting is just too predictable, with Jeff Bridges as the Hippie leader of the program, Clooney as an earnest crackpot (tapping into his character in \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\"), Kevin Spacey as a neurotic weasel, and Ewan McGregor (Obi Wan Kenobi) as the journalist/apprentice to this \\"Jedi\\" military program.  McGregor's performance is the worst, as he struggles to maintain a neutral American accent.  The older co-stars just phone in performances they've done many times before.<br /><br />Perhaps the most telling indictment of this movie is that the special features - which include interviews of the book's author, and former members of the \\"Jedi\\" program - are much more interesting than the film itself.  Be forewarned.

I am really disappointed discovery sold out the integrity of this HD nature series just because Okra wanted to do it. So if Discovery says no...then what??? Oprah buys them out and fires everybody?? Come on!!     I..... like everyone else in the known universe, loved Planet Earth. You got HD set up with BluRay and you wanted to \\"awe\\" your friends/family ...Planet Earth is what you put in! I so waited for this new series... The second I saw it was narrated by that ...I asked myself \\"why\\"????????  I mean look at the super low amount of stars this got by so many people . Why?? is the series bad...nope, this is a great visual series and it pics up where Planet Earth left off! But the way she dumbs down the narration is like pulling off a band aid very very slowly with a chunk of scab stuck on it. Wow she's terrible.      Only Oprah-natics would think shes actually doing a good job. Anybody with half a brain and a 2nd grade education will instantly see the difference between Planet Earths narration and this one. She's horrid! I will still buy it, but it will be the BBC version for sure!! At least over there ... integrity still means something.

B002ZG99D6|2.0|If you didn't get your fill of sappy Nicholas Sparks melodrama with the February release of \\"Dear John,\\" grab a box of Kleenex and head to your local theater, because \\"The Last Song\\" has finally opened. Sparks must get some psychological fix from making audiences cry. There's nothing wrong with catharsis, but I do take issue with stories that try to manipulate in such obvious ways. This movie, so far as I can tell, has no ambition other than to toy with our emotions, and not in a way that's clever, intelligent, or subtle; it simply goes from one contrived situation to the next before ending on a shamelessly sentimental note. How could it end any other way when it makes use of such an inherently ominous title?    When I reviewed \\"Dear John,\\" I stated, rather inelegantly, that, \\"I can't feel a certain way when a movie is telling me that I'm supposed to feel that way.\\" Here's my chance to say the same thing, only more refined: A movie should not tell me to feel the feelings I'm supposed to feel. If I'm to have a genuine emotional payoff, the story must work with me and not at me; \\"The Last Song\\" was so aggressive in its attempts to get a reaction that I felt not like an audience member but an unwilling participant in a psychological study. There's nothing to be gained by making us sit through a series of events so manufactured and heavy handed, they seem to have been borrowed from a weepy after school special.    I can find nothing wrong with the casting of Greg Kinnear, a decent and accomplished actor who does the best he can given the material. But the casting of Miley Cyrus is problematic. While her performance isn't especially bad, it's hardly remarkable -- any young actress could have played this role and been just as good. Ah, but not every young actress has her face adorned on album covers, shampoo bottles, T-shirts, posters, and magnets. She's marketable. If it's advertised that she will star in a movie, people will come to see it. I do have hope that she willsomeday shed her teen idol image and emerge as a serious performer, but until then, she will have to make do with her status as a packaged product.    Cyrus plays Ronnie Miller, a seventeen-year-old piano prodigy. She hasn't spoken to her father, former music professor Steve Miller (Kinnear), ever since he divorced her mother (Kelly Preston) and returned to the small, quiet beach community of Tybee Island, Georgia, his hometown. Moody and rebellious, Ronnie has stopped playing the piano, and she flatly refuses offers to attend Julliard. Against her wishes, she and her kid brother, Jonah (Bobby Coleman), are sent to spend the summer with Steve, which he hopes will finally give them a chance to reconnect. Ronnie's attitude is a pall that hangs over the whole thing, as is Steve's mission to rebuild a stained glass window from a church that burned under mysterious circumstances.    But what would this movie be without a romance? Here enters Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth), the hunky Volleyball player who's also a mechanic and a volunteer for the local aquarium. Popular, charming, and annoyingly persistent, he soon gets Ronnie to drop her misery act, at which point they fall in deeply in love. He eventually takes her to meet his wealthy parents, who, naturally, snub their noses at her in the most polite way possible. Will has his own tragic back story, although you'd hardly believe it -- there are precious few moments in this movie when Hemsworth isn't showing off a big dopey grin, drastically undermining his character's personal problems.    Other dramas weave throughout the story, including a secret known only to Will and his best friend (Hallock Beals), a troubled young woman befriended by Ronnie (Carly Chaikin), and that troubled young woman's boyfriend (Nick Lashaway), a good-for-nothing thug who enters and exits every one of his scenes as if he were drunk. Each could have contributed something meaningful had they not been so underdeveloped. A few light hearted moments are reserved for little Jonah, whose precocious dialogue and clever handling of money suggests the filmmakers were not inspired by an authentic ten-year-old. Consider a montage midway through the film, in which Ronnie tries on a number of dresses in a clothing store. In the annals of wardrobe montages, has there ever been one in which a young boy was an active participant?    If it seems like I'm ranting, if I'm coming off as bitter and jaded, I'm sorry, but this movie rubbed me the wrong way. Everything about it was just so artificial, and it was all forced upon me. Even the title was an attempt at my heartstrings, which is infuriating because it doubles as the movie's own spoiler. I now realize that Nicholas Sparks is not a master manipulator, because manipulation is by definition underhanded; emotionally, he doesn't want to trick you so much as beat you into submission, and his weapons of choice are formulaic plots with melodramatic turns of events. I can't fault him for being successful at what he does, but I am starting to wonder why so many people are making it possible for him.

B00004RGUI|5.0|This recording is truly exquisite. John Herberman has a incredible touch on the piano and in my opinion, is moving towards transcendent with his gift. His playing & the musical arrangements of these songs really fit with Dan Gibson's nature sounds, which are amazing in themselves (with a great back story!). This is one of my favourite CD's, along with Solitude's Forest Piano and Rhythms of the Sea (I also esp. like Country Retreat). We used the song \\"Wishing\\" from this CD as the processional song at our outdoor wedding at the cottage. This CD, along with the others I mentioned, do not 'rev' up the adrenalin in my system, but have the opposite effect. They seem to bring my system back down to a restful, settled place. They also have a healing effect on the emotions. Am quite serious about that! Very highly recommended. Some of these solitudes albums are a gift to the world, along with Dan Gibson's nature recordings. Thanks to the Gibson family & those at Solitudes for continuing after Dan Sr. passed away in 2006. This CD is a wonderful addition to any home.
B0033TJATW|1.0|Amazon leads you to beleive this is a re-release of the original Moonwalker DVD, but it is NOT. It looks like an Asian bootleg copy. You are better off saving your money and watching one of the high defition uploads of it on YouTube.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This is not your average murder mystery.  It becomes and obsession, exciting and thrilling.  It keeps you thinking pensively through each page because it's so different. Larsson's style is refershing as mystries go and it takes place in a part of the world that stirs your imagination to visualize it's whereabouts! The location is as chilling as the book.  Great on the Kindle!
B00337KM2S|4.0|This was a pretty good if not great story of a business traveler who spends almost all of his time on a plane--that is, when he isn't firing people or training others in how to do the same.  The film explores the lack of connection and empathy on his part in regard to the horrible job he has, and how others  can spend time with family while he has almost no one to spend time with except on a temporary basis.    I'm not sure why this had so many nominations.  It's solid work from Clooney but certainly not his best role by any means.  His role in O Brother, Where Art Thou?  was much stronger and more substantial.
0061537969|5.0|Great story narrated by a Dog (Enzo) and his perspectives of life.  Fast read, because I didn't want to put it down.  Great book to take on a vacation.  It's a man's novel too as it has a lot to do with Car Racing, but never boring for a woman either.  I truly think everyone should read this book.  Great messages!
B000BKACO8|4.0|When my 8th grade English teacher assigned To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee for us to read, I thought it would be boring or maybe give me some hunting tips. The first half of the book was a little lacking, but I soon came to love this book! It follows the lives of three children (Scout and Jem Finch and their best friend Dill Harris) in the 1930's, and at the same time follows Scout and Jem's father Atticus in his legal battle to save an innocent black man from the charge of raping a white woman. Over the course of about two years, the kids make mischief, learn life lessons, and try to get their reclusive neighbor, Boo Radley, to come out of his house. With believable characters, an excellent use of accents and satire, and a surprise ending that will leave you guessing, it's a wonderful novel that I recommend to anyone that can read
B000FA5TTW|1.0|This was the biggest waste of my time!! Absolutely one of the worst, disjointed, unbelievable stories I have read in many years. Don't expect to be able to follow any train of thought. There simply isn't any. Ms. Sebold evidently cannot write about anything without going off in multiple directions that have nothing to do with the original thought.  She seems to be mesmerized by everything and anything. None of which has anything to do with the story.    If the movie is anything like the book, I'll be walking out.
1400052173|4.0|Non-fiction book of the Life and Times of Henrietta Lacks.  Her cervical cancer cells were extracted at Johns Hopkins during the early 1950's.  The cells grew like nothing the scientists and researchers had ever witnessed.  Her cells were given to any researcher who wanted them.  She died never knowing that her cells were extracted.  Her name was eventually released to the public and then her family found out.  Due to low education levels of her family, they never really understood what was happening.  They just knew that millions were being made from these cells - and yet they couldn't even get health insurance.  A riveting story of the HeLa cells and their effect on her family.
