B000MV90IU|3.0|This is a classic film,which deserves a five star rating.But anyone interested in seeing it as it was originally filmed may want to hold onto their older DVD copy.As Amazon notes here,Bullitt was shot in the 2.40 to 1 aspect ratio,which means there should still be the usual black bars on a 16x9 set.Instead,Warner Video cropped the ends off to fill the screen.It's still a fantastic film,and the image quality is fine,but...  If I had known,I probably would not have bought it.
B0034KHFM4|5.0|At first I wasn't a big GaGa fan, but Bad Romance and Love Game got me.  When I bought Fame Monster, I played it continually.  My mom bought it too and we jam out to it when we are together. Gaga is so unbelievably talented. She just keeps wow'ing and leaving us begging for more.  Born This Way is guaranteed to be even better than Fame Monster and Monster.

0553593544|5.0|I didn't expect to like this novel.  I'd tried to read Ludlum 20 years ago, because my ex-wife used to take his novels on vacation, and every so often I'd pick one up to see what was all the fuss about Ludlum.  I couldn't get through them (I don't even remember which ones they were).  His characters were so overdone as to be unreal, his plots were ridiculously grand scale and the things that happened were like something out of cartoons.    So I decided to read The Bourne Identity after seeing and enjoying the Matt Damon movie.  I approached the book with some skepticism, but was quickly and pleasantly surprised.  Bourne is instantly a sympathetic character, since you meet him after he's been horribly injured, and has no idea who he is or where he came from.  The novel unfolds from there, with Bourne successively learning bits about his past as he realizes he's a trained killing machine.  He has genuine anguish about what he does to the people who are chasing him, and is even more tormented by what he may have done in his past to have these mysterious people trying to kill him.  The love interest he develops is believably handled and tastefully done.  The action scenes are not only exciting but realistic.  This is a great thriller that deserves to be on a short list of classics like Day of the Jackal, Three Days of the Condor, LeCarre's Smiley series and The Hunt for Red October.
B004132HZS|5.0|If you haven't seen this get it. And get it for someone else too. Great gift. Cumberbatch is fantastic as Sherlock. Smart, witty and appropriately odd. Martin Freeman (The Office) gives a multi-dimensional Watson. His story is as compelling as Sherlock's. The writing is first rate. The show is very inventive and looks great.
0143038419|1.0|It wasn't exactly like she cast her fate to the wind and took off on an adventure. She was paid by a publisher to make this journey and write a book. This wasn't real, it was about money and a business deal. That is why she seemed self absorbed, it is because she is. Don't waste your money on a phony!
B003L20ICE|2.0|In terms of acting, it's a great film. Each character is fleshed out to the point where they seem like real people. The problem with slice of life pictures like this, is they often don't offer a reason to watch. It's so much like life that is boring. Nothing ever happens. I don't mean that there needs to be explosions, or car chases or death. But beyond a few arguments, there is nothing here to make someone feel like the story should have ever been told, if there were a story at all.<br />Conflict sure.<br />Climax... sorta....<br />Resolution... not really.<br /><br />Just, a few bickers, a flighty affair, and then, nothing.<br />Nothing is changed, solved or resolved.<br /><br />Again, actors are great, the story is not.

B000LC4TJ0|1.0|Upon coming across Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake people who have never seen a ballet may feel qualified to express the view that the experience was earth-shaking.  People who have never seen an opera and are confronted with this recording may also feel qualified to comment upon what Mozart and da Ponte had in mind when they put together the Marriage of Figaro.  To prevent such individuals from making complete fools out of themselves, here are a few explanations.<br /><br />The Marriage of Figaro offers overwhelming evidence that, no matter what Aristotle says, a tragedy does not necessarily end in catharsis.  In other words, a tragedy does not necessarily lead to resolution.  The Marriage of Figaro is a tragedy. Susanna, the Countess, Figaro, the Count, Cherubino, Barbarina -- are all attractive and caught in the steel net of human emotions, urges and passions.  They thrash about trying to assuage the yearnings that choke them, and fail totally.  When the opera ends, absolutely nothing has been resolved.  We feel for them because we have all been there. But we feel doubly for them because they are more attractive than we are and it seems unfair that, perhaps, they hurt so much precisely because, unlike us, they are attractive.<br /><br />I discovered the Marriage of Figaro fifty years ago, in Graduate School, when I realized I had locked myself in the wrong discipline.  It is no exaggeration to say that this opera kept me from committing suicide.  Since that time, I have collected every recording ever made and I have repeatedly gone to Milan, Vienna, New York and Salzburg to see what different artists were doing to this marvel.<br /><br />This recording is a sacrilege.  Using tiresome variations of Scandinavian angst as a starting point, it has violated the exquisite taste of the composer and the urbane melancholy of the librettist.  It has introduced a deplorable creature with feathers to point at the obvious, and, in the name of modernity and innovation, it has made Susanna, Figaro, the Countess, the Count and Cherubino not attractive at all.  Over the years, I've listened to worse singing but nowhere have I witnessed a comparable determination to make a stupendous work of art look third-rate.<br /><br />It is possible that someone for whom opera is terra incognita will see this travesty, think it's just great, and become curious about an art form that is far removed from disco music. Curiosity may then lead to a systematic exploration of what looks like an alien universe.  When some familiarity with the universe in question has been secured, the former ignoramus will feel deeply embarrassed that he rushed to give his vote of confidence to something he knew nothing about.<br /><br />Hopefully, he won't do it again.ntess, the Count and Cherubino not attractive at all.

B000002U8G|4.0|This is a review of the 1994 release of \\"Meddle\\", which runs to 46:51 minutes long. In some ways I find it a bit like The Rolling Stones' album \\"Let it bleed\\"...they dabble in certain American music genres. However, I find Pink Floyd's approach to have worked, where I just found The Rolling Stones' version unsatisfying...generally I'd say that if you want to listen to country of blues, don't listen to the Stones do it...listen to American acts of those genres. No such complaints with this Pink Floyd release though.      The best tracks:      One of these days - \\".\\".  5:58 minutes long. I'd say that I knew this song when I heard it, though from where I couldn't say...not a prevalent song on the radio in any case...don't think I've ever heard it played there. Bookended by the sound of wind, the opening starts off with exploratory bass notes. Guitars double, then you get into a chuggah chuggah rhythm. As far as the bass goes, maybe here you get a foreshadowing of their later track \\"Run like Hell\\"? Synthesiser notes are familiar...the sharp ones in any case - where from, I can't say. Some psychedelic noise occurs. Drums sound big at times. Guitar sounds like a roaring motorbike engine at times on this track. For all intents and purposes this is pretty much an instrumental track.    Fearless - \\">[.]\\". 6:09. Liked this song enough to note it on my second listen. Another peaceful track. A semi-acoustic guitar may feature on this song. Song occasionally has a \\"Wake up little Suzie\\" vibe to it (a song by The Everly Brothers). Guitar has a country twang to it. Vocals are smooth. Sounds like a crowd was recorded at the Kop...one wonders if they would have sounded so hearty had they been recorded a year from now, with Liverpool relegated to the next division down (as they seem to be headed that way at the time of writing). The football crowd parts sound spacey at times.      The rest:      A pillow of wind - 5:11. Mellow track in a King Crimson type of manner. Acoustic guitar and the electric lead guitar has a country twang to it. Lyrics seem to hark back to Pink Floyd's original lyricist, Syd Barrett, with reference to eiderdown.    San Tropez - 3:44.  Not sure if \\"rag\\" is the right word for this style of song...I'm not musically trained...seems an odd kind of musical genre in any case. Instruments played include piano, acoustic guitar, bass and a guitar with a country twang to it later. Maybe the guitars can be said to sound Hawaiian at times too. Piano, bass and drums sound a bit jazzy at times too.    Seamus - 2:16. Lazy, mellow blues track with dual acoustic guitar and maybe the semi-acoustic guitar too. Piano and a subtle sounding harmonica feature too. A howling dog joins in at times! A touch of Robert Johnson to this track too (the pioneering blues recording African American guitarist/singer).     Echoes - 23:31. Yes, that's right...this track takes up the best part of half an hour! I didn't think that vinyl LPs could record a track of more than 22.5 on one side, but it appears I was mistaken on that...so this track obviously made up one entire side of the original vinyl release! Drumming on this track is interesting...a contender for my list of the best drumming tracks.  At the start, you hear a sonar ping, like you would hear on a submarine (presumably!). Found myself drifting off for most of this song...maybe on both listens...but not so much second time around. It's the track's pleasant and mellow nature which is responsible for this...so, it's not a criticism about the track being boring or anything. Like I say, the drums are interesting on this...both the playing and the texture of the drums themselves. An organ features and yet another twangy sounding electric lead guitar. Guitars do have different texture to their sound at times though. The bluesy electric lead guitar put in mind Mark Knopfler's playing with Dire Straits...so maybe he was influenced by a band like Pink Floyd on an album like this? There is a pretty vocal melody at times too. 7 minutes into the track the sound quality seems to change...for the better. It has presence and is not subtle, like the rest of the album. This passage of the song has a smooth, extended jam with organ, bass, electric lead guitar and drums. The jam ends with some howling wind and eerie, ghostly moans on the synth. You also hear what sounds like ravens and weird synth 'voices', I think. This part reminds me of the classic Jean Michel Jarre album \\"Oxygene\\". Perhaps he was influenced by material like this? Bassy sounds on this track have a sort of \\"The happiest days of our lives\\" vibe to them, I think. Outro has disconcerting noise at the end...maybe if there wasn't that jarring element I might have noted this track as one of the better ones.       Pink Floyd recommendations (albums up until this one):      More soundtrack - has a couple of their heaviest rock songs...perhaps heaviest ever, as well as some mellow stuff too.  8/10    The piper at the gates of dawn - a strange but compelling album. I'm sure it has a lot of repeat listen value to it too.  75+/100

B004GNYGTI|1.0|This movie plot is extremely predictable, even by action movie standards.  I am still trying to figure out how Angelina Jolie keeps getting selected for these roles.  If you have seen Tomb Raider or Mr. and Mrs. Smith or Wanted then you have already seen this movie at least once.  Move on.
B003M5AXN4|5.0|Alright, so the layout is as such, the movie is great, the acting is amazing!! Minus the younger brother, probably the worst acting I've ever seen, the only other part I can't stand about this movie is the animation, I start to watch the movie, Rex and Speed, played by Emile Hirsch, are in the car, and its so obvious that hes in front of a green screen, i mean, they didnt even remotely try to blend it in, and make it realistic, and i know, that this movie/show is kinda supposed to be like that, its just so cheesy it's almost unbearable.    Next, Speed is grown up a little, and he's finally a racer, he is in his car at the racetrack, and the graphics are just stunning, i love every part of that race scene, his car the track, the camera angles, everything, i just love it. At this point in the story, i forgive them for what i said before. He is then confronted by a man named Royalton, obviously a shady egotistical man, played by Roger Allam, he did a really good job with the part. He invited them to become partners, now this is where you get a peek at the history of Speed, how he became a racer and learn about who and what kind of person he is. After the much internal conflict, Speed respectfully declines which makes Royalton's true self come out. The acting and graphics throughout this whole scene was amazing, again, except for the kid.    Until it comes time to actually go off the track into the wild, when Speed enters the \\"forbidden race\\", i couldn't wait to see how it was gonna look, the second he got into the forest and the desert, i wanted to shoot myself to spare me from the 2 year old sketchbook animation, it looked like they had hot wheels on strings, especially the helicopters, barf. That's all that can be said about that.    So, Speed won the race and got entered into the grand prix, with help. At the start of it, the animation goes back to being thee amazing one of a kind thing, and they get stopped in id say a ravine, now here comes the fighting scene, something I could almost not bear to watch, now again, i know they were trying to give that speed racer old school vibe, but ughhhhhhh, terrible!!!!     Speed won the grand prix and the are on the stand celebrating, it looks like its in someones basement, they could of at least shown a few people in front of it, no, its just them on it, clapping their hands looking stupid, this is another part where I just wanted the younger speed(Nicholas Elia) to shut up.

0345479092|1.0|Her tone is opinionated and frustrating.  If you disagree with anything she says, you're wrong.  Her advice on breastfeeding and the introduction of solid foods contradicts even the AAP's recommendations.  She seems to prefer formula-feeding to breastfeeding, and reading her chapter on feeding would surely convince any tired mama to give up on breastfeeding.<br /><br />I've read several baby books, and I find that most of them have some good advice and are worth the read even if I don't agree with everything the author has to say.  This book, however, has the potential to HURT rather than HELP struggling parents.
0143036424|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I read The Cold Dish. I was gratified to find another author I enjoy. I love the writing, the surprise ending, and the characters--who are not movie-star glamorous, superior sleuths, nor incomparably wise and good. I liked them for their humanity and I came away thinking about the good in all of us flawed human beings. The book is fast-paced and a compelling read. It shows the heart of the characters, especially Longmire, who feels deeply for the victims of the crimes he has to solve. I highly recommend it. I look forward to reading the rest of the Walt Longmire mysteries including Another Man's Moccasins, which was a finalist for the High Plains Book Best Fiction Award along with my novel, Kyleah's Tree.

B00479SVBU|5.0|This thing just works. Took it out of the box, plugged in a USB jump drive that happened to be laying on the desk, went to the pickup, plugged it in to a power port, set the FM frequency, tuned the radio to that frequency, and the thing just worked. The FM signal is strong; better, I think, than my XM radio's FM signal. The audio reproduction is very good. Tried it with an SD card. Same great experience. Have yet to try its remaining input port. The monitor has just enough information to make it easy to use. Tells you what FM frequency you're on, the name of your folder from which a file is currently being played, the name of the song, the name of the artist, which file number in the folder is playing, and the minutes and seconds elapsed. Pretty good for a small outfit that does not gum up the works or interfere with things on and around your vehicle dash. Very happy with it. Bought 3 more for more vehicles. I suppose there could be better ones somewhere for more money, but my search is over.
0156711427|4.0|A Passage to India, written by E. M. Forster in 1924, is on many short lists of greatest novels written in the 20th century, and deservedly so.  It is a period piece, set in the British Raj of the 1920s.  It is rich in imagery and symbolism, focusing on bigotry, hypocrisy and mistrust among the various nationalities and religions present within the story.  Idealism, naivety and human nature also play parts.<br /><br />At its heart, is the friendship between the Muslim Indian professional, Dr. Aziz, and the English dowager, Mrs. Moore, who has accompanied her son's presumptive fianc&eacute;e to meet him in Chandrapore.  Aziz, Mrs. Moore and Mr. Fielding, a British schoolmaster, struggle to bridge the abyss existing between the British and native cultures.  For their troubles, they are punished, each in distinctive ways.<br /><br />Having seen the movie, an excellent flick by the way, I was intimately familiar with the tale.  The Victorian style of writing, however, really brought the story to life and breathed life into the characters.  Some may find the writing too florid or archaic for their tastes, but I found it beneficial in setting a mood for the story.<br /><br />While the driving force behind the book is the social interaction (or lack of) and the cultural divide between the British administrators and what they view as their morally and intellectually inferior native Indian subjects, a subtext is the mistrust and tension existing between the Hindu and Moslem religious communities.<br /><br />As Aziz becomes increasingly disenchanted with his British overlords, he begins to fall in with Indian nationalists.  The question of the viability of an \\"Indian\\" state, in the presence of such a politically, ethnically and religiously fragmented populace is periodically raised.  Very perceptive writing, coming as it does over twenty years prior to Indian independence, civil war and ultimately partition.

B004G6009K|3.0|I went into this movie not expecting much. Most recent Disney movies have sucked. I was very surprised by the quality of the animation in this film. They put some serious effort into the background scenery, the water flowing, the lighting, ect. Many of those shots are worthy of framing. I did not like the character style, however. It reminded me of my daughter's Barbie movies and was very un-Disneylike when compared to the classics. Not bad, but not what I have grown to love.     The story moved along fairly well with nothing terribly unexpected happening. My biggest disappointment was the music. A great Disney movie uses the music to set the theme for the movie and the music moves the story along. With a few notes you can pick out the theme songs of Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, or even the Rescuers. I can't remember a single song from this forgettable score and I just saw it yesterday. I got the impression the songs were stuck in there because all animated Disney  movies have songs, and not because they actually cared what the songs were.     In the end, my daughter loved this movie and my wife enjoyed it. So it is better than the component parts. I will probably buy it, which is more than I can say for most Disney movies of the last few years, but it will not be a favorite.

0823016714|5.0|This book may not be necessary for everyone, but for sequential artists looking for consistency and emotional involvement, it is. I hope this series expands to produce books the size size focusing exclusively on people in their 20's, people in their 30's, and so on.    One drawback is that if you're drawing a story which concentrates on people in their 20's, you'd have about six different faces for males, and six different faces for female characters. This book is a great overview of many ages, but does not concentrate on one demographic. I hope the publisher, Watson Guptill, will expand the series by age in the future.    The sequential expressions are fantastic, and the Phonemes are extremely useful as well.

B002ZG993Q|3.0|I knew it wasn't an action thriller going in, but the slow pace still put me off a little. The plot was a little open-ended. The plot was the typical bad guy(gangster/spy/hitman), something happens to him, he becomes human, he wants to stop after one last job, sometimes he finds love, and sometimes he even survives.  Movies with a similar plot would be Carlito's Way, Grosse Pointe Blank, the Angel and the Bad Man, etc. This movie is a little more subtle than the others, but not much.    Clooney was very good, but I think he might have been miscaste a tad, although he looked very lean and mean in the movie. The priest was good. He had a great face and personality. The Italian girlfriend/hooker was ok, but it wasn't much of a part. I'm not sure why Clooney fell for her. The scenery was good. The endless roads and streets were interesting, but boring after a while. Even though I never found out what exactly is going on in the movie, predicting what was happening next was not difficult, so it seemed long for its running time. The movie used twisting country roads or narrow confusing streets as a metaphor for the plot, but it is not that complicated.     In summary, the acting and scenery was good, the plot was ok but vague, and the pacing was slow.

B000LPQ6DE|1.0|The script for this loose BBC adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's 1847 novel is so deplorable as to be unwatchable.  It discards key elements of the plot, distorts much of the rest, and flattens the story into a mere Gothic romance largely lacking the novel's penetrating social criticism.  Barely a hint remains of the steely ethical and religious imperatives that both mold and fetter the characters and elevate their sacrifices to invoke grace and redemption. ~ The screenwriter substitutes modern vernacular for Bronte's stately prose, stripping the characters of majesty and depth.  The glittering, self-deprecating humor between Mr. Rochester and Miss Eyre is gone, and all they can do together is pout or flirt.  Crudeness replaces cordiality.  Rochester's first words to Jane on falling from his horse are not a restrained, \\"You must just stand on one side...thank you,\\" but a repugnant, \\"Get away from me, witch!\\" ~ Much of the dialogue is simply pedestrian.  Readers who cherish the master's indignant reproof, \\"You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!\\" must now endure, \\"The devil, you will advertise!\\"  Rochester no longer alludes to the historic source of his misery by beseeching Jane to \\"imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you there commit a capital error,\\" but instead says, \\"You have to imagine a young man...who has made a mistake, not his fault.\\"  One fears BBC's next update will have him say, \\"I made a boo-boo.\\" ~ Ruth Wilson brings intelligence and intensity to Jane but is far too forward and familiar to be credible as a product of repressive Calvinist charity.  Toby Stephens plays Rochester as a sneering and abrasive boor.  When Jane answers his proposal of marriage by saying, \\"I can hardly believe you,\\" the viewer sympathizes. ~ Whether you're a purist or just prefer a far richer adaptation with beautiful language and diction, stick to BBC's 1983 version with the dashing, despairing Timothy Dalton and the demure yet indomitable Zelah Clarke.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|Don't get me wrong.  Winter's Bone--starring Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes--is supremely acted, sublimely scripted and a deservedly-so Oscar contender; a true slice of American life. But, just how big is that slice of Americana?     Frankly, I can't decide which genre is beginning to bore me more:  rednecks or ghetto blacks. Both claim to be representative of the \\"real America.\\"  For the life of me, I have to go many miles and far out of my way to run into either. But, I'm sure that somewhere in these great, golden plains of ours there are older sisters saddled with the responsibility of raising their younger siblings in rundown trailers on land cluttered with abandoned cars and pick-up trucks and--to be sure--there are older siblings who (in time-honored survival training) teach their younger counterparts how to shoot a double barrel shot gun and skin a squirrel for supper. But, Holy American Flag, if such dramatic depictions were really the broad stroke of Ameican life, we'd have more congressional (population-based) representation in states like Montana, Wyoming, South and North Dakota, etc. No.  Most Americans live in throbbing (for good or bad) urban centers.       So, while I enjoyed Winter's Bone and highly recommend it as an artistic achievement and a film to be consumed and appreciated, I wish our film makers would cut back on exporting American myths and legends in their art and portray in their films what is the \\"real America\\" to most Americans: middle-class, day-to-day survival in a city or suburb not far away from a natural park or rednecks or ghetto blacks.  Boring?  Maybe, but a challenge I hope someone takes us \\"real Americans\\" up on.
B000784WMW|5.0|Purists will prize BBC's 1983 adaptation of Jane Eyre (DVD, 311 minutes).  The screenplay is faithful to Charlotte Bronte's 1847 novel about a young woman torn between desolate freedom and imprisonment in either immoral love or lovelorn duty. ~ Timothy Dalton is dashing but desperate as the godless Mr. Rochester, while Zelah Clarke's Jane is pious yet compassionate, vulnerable yet indomitable.  Dalton's ringing baritone and lavish trilled r's, his imposing stature and impulsive physicality form a fascinating foil to Clarke's soft-spoken sympathy and cerebral restraint.  The script preserves much of the Bronte's stately prose, both within the dialogue and throughout narrative passages, and the actors speak with impeccable diction.  The glittering, self-deprecating humor between Mr. Rochester and Miss Eyre is a delight. ~ Unlike other adaptations, this screenplay avoids degenerating into a mere Gothic romance.  It addresses most of the steely ethical and religious imperatives that both mold and fetter the characters and elevate their sacrifices to create meaning. ~ However, the script stops short of revealing the depth of Rochester's surrender through grief and remorse to humility and piety.  In the novel, this crucial step is a prerequisite for his redemption from depravity and his ascendancy to grace.  When Jane first reunites with him in this screenplay, Rochester reacts with wrathful pride to his mistaken perception that she now regards him with pity.  This seems a pointless departure from the original text. ~ Even so, the final scene makes up for it; and although Rochester does not actually bow his head in prayer and thank God for tempering judgment with mercy, Dalton portrays his renewed marriage proposal with almost agonizing poignancy.
0385341008|5.0|This book was a labor of love and it is apparent with each word. The unique format makes it a quick and easy read. This is another one I place upon my favorites list. I read it in one sitting, unable to put it down. You will find it just as delightful, I am sure!
B00026WU64|5.0|When people say Bob Dylan's songs are timeless, they are so right. We always had an album to two on hand, but felt that we needed to \\"complete\\" the collection. Now in our 60's, we're getting more out of his songs than ever before. These lyrics were so important when they were new, but they haven't lost anything in the 30 to 40 years since. Can't believe we never had this album, yet we know most of the songs by heart. It's a treat to hear the original verions of each one. The only usual complaint is that the lyrics are never included on any of Dylan's albums. Bought the lyrics book \\"Bob Dylan yrics 1962 - 2001\\" and it is pure literature itself, but also a good companion to his albums. As one reviewer said, this is a beautiful album to listen to anytime, anywhere.
0064430227|5.0|This. book. rocks. Uncluttered art (black lines for Harold and otherwise just his purple pencil marks); unclutterd story line; realistic portrayal of child's play; and considered example of an obstacle and how to overcome it, make this a powerful example of how one's imagination can build worlds. Great length for a 2-4 year old to sit through, but the art makes it a great \\"me do it!\\" reader, too.   To top it off, Harold's slightly grey and undetailed rendering means he could be either black or white. This makes him a role model to help even *more* children learn what crayons can be used for other than redecorating the livingroom.  Grab a roll of butcher paper to try a \\"Harold-style adventure\\" game with your kids and watch their imaginations and grasp of narrative take off!
B004APVI1G|5.0|All features and content are excellent. I bought it because the movie I liked it at all, but when I see those extras I breathtaking about it.  Time to delivery was perfect, less than they estimated.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I used to be a runner, ran marathons, was a gymrat, loved pilates, but after a knee injury and job change, running went slowly to the wayside. I gained 35 pounds the last 2 years and was looking for something to do at home during the winter months besides pilates.     Jillian's DVD was very good and I kept up with level 1 fine, level 2 with more modifications and didn't look at 3 yet. I did both together because I had the time although I will do level 1 alone tonight.    My reservations are her \\"You can do it, ANYONE can do it, I teach 400 pd women, etc\\"   My knees can't do deep squats and you don't have to ever do more than the instructor showing the modifications. Sometimes she makes it seem like the advanced instructor is the prize, but you don't have to do that. You do have to work hard to see results, I always pushed myself, but with sense...this isn't the 70's with the \\"no pain, no gain\\" mentality. I work for an orthopaedic office and have a friend who is a physical therapist and see we see the results of not being sensible. You can do similar exercises using 2 body parts, and not do the exact ones she is doing. The idea is to use 2 muscle groups and not stop, whether it's jumping jacks, plank, etc. doesn't matter, and varying it will make them less boring after a while.     I also felt good that the abs seemed easy after years of pilates even  though I have a little padding on them now. Maybe she should try that too...helps flexibility and nothing beats the \\"100\\" and other pilates moves for abs. : )
0439023513|3.0|After reading the first two in the series (actually, I listened to the audio-books), I needed to hear this final volume. That should tell you that I did like this trilogy. Of course, The Hunger Games is best, but I did enjoy this final book more than the second. A lot actually happens in this story of the rebellion against the capital. It was fun to follow up with characters I had come to care about. And there were some surprises (which I won't spoil for you). I especially liked the ending. Very cool. What I didn't like was Katniss's personality. She regressed from the first novel. She was less strong and less mature. She was an engaging heroine in The Hunger Games, but in Mockingjay, she turned into an indecisive girl, indecisive in both war and love. I recommend this as something you almost have to read if you've read the first two of the trilogy.
1441965904|4.0|I am a PhD student in Philosophy and I occasionally I have to present my work to an international audience. Before reading this book I was extremely nervous about giving presentations, but this book has helped me overcome all my problems and I am now much more confident (though not perfect yet!). I think the most important thing I learned as that I tend to make the same 'mistakes' in presentations independently of whether I am giving the presentation in English or Italian (my mother tongue) - in fact, provided that you practice enough, the English language is not really the main problem. More important is good clear slides and a lot of preparation. My only reason for not giving this book five stars is that if would have been useful to have an accompanying DVD.

B0002F6BQU|5.0|always loved this movie and am happy to be able to see it any time I want----its a very heartwarming story
0143118420|5.0|I thought this book was great- I had no expectations, really, and had never read any other reviews of the book nor had I seen the movie.  I bought it on a whim in an airport.    Looking at the other reviews, it seems that many who disliked it seem to think that the author should have just gotten over her drama without the travels and experiences in the book.  The ones who liked it seem to think that it is a very nice story of personal growth and spirituality, and they aren't overly judgmental about her being such a \\"drama queen\\" to begin with.  I happen to be the 2nd kind- I found it a very engaging read with real wisdom in it that shows an aspect of the human condition.  Well done.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I purchased \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" because I wanted the song \\"IT HAD BETTER BE TONIGHT\\" from the movie The Pink Panther.  Michael Buble is probably the only young vocalist I am aware of that has the talent to sing these old standards and do them justice.  Most of the songs on this CD, except for a few, are old classics and as with any classic, new interpretations give them new life.  Great listening!
0062515675|1.0|Unfortunately the book has not arrived... It was for January the 11th but I'm still waiting...It's an excellent book though.
B000ILYYJE|3.0|When I reviewed this product, I thought to myself 6CD/6DVD boxset. This has to have a lot of stuff that I have not heard or seen before. So I spent the money. I was also considering The Doors Complete Box Set, but it was a little more. Unfortunately, this boxset's CD's have some different versions of their songs, but I found them more redundant than refreshing. As far as the DVD's go I was also hoping for more LIVE performances and unseen footage.This too was a bit disappointing.

1599218011|5.0|....there was a beautiful princess who partied like a rockstar and woke up one day not feeling so well.  From there the news got worse..and worse.  She not only had cancer, but it was rare.  She really didn't get much encouraging news.  And so, this beautiful princess pulled out her sword (it's the 21st century, right?  A Princess carries her own sword now!) and she decided to fight back!  Her fight has been amazing, courageous and full of passion.  Along her path she has tested many theories, alternative paths and her energy, kindness, education and enthusiasm has just magnified!    This book is amazing.  It's not about being sick, though the sick may definitely benefit.  It's not about what you are doing wrong, it's all about what you can do RIGHT!  It is full of fun and education and energy and possibilities. And it's beautiful! Really... you could spend the cost of this book on a dinner you won't remember the next day.  And this book just might CHANGE YOUR ENERGY and CHANGE YOUR LIFE!    This writer is introducing this new way of life to the 3rd person she knows who is fighting a dangerous disease.  And this writer is embracing this life style to clear her mind and be the best she can be.  Be the best you can be!  Jump on board!  It might be the beginning of something you can't see now...just like the princess who was told she was sick, but found instead a life she could not dream of...we all have the privilege of chosing a similar path and being wonderfully surprised!  See you there!

1599218011|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Kris Carr is an amazing, inspiring, fantastic wellness warrior who encourages readers with her upbeat attitude & hilarious sense of humor.  This book will truly make you want to cut the crap from your life - and not just junk food.  I was already living a fairly healthy life when I read this book, but Kris has inspired me to make further healthy tweaks to my diet (and my lifestyle habits), and for that, I am forever grateful.  This book is everything I hoped for & more.  I laughed, I cried, and I felt empowered while reading it!  Vibrant health & happiness is something that everyone deserves, but not everyone knows how to attain (or maintain).  \\"Crazy Sexy Diet\\" is a fantastic tool for anyone looking to live their best life NOW.    I am nearing the end of the 21 Day Adventure Cleanse (detailed in the book), and I have never felt better in all my life!  This is not a \\"diet\\" in the sense that I had to deprive myself for three weeks & motivate myself by looking forward to Day 22 when I could go back to my old bad habits.  Instead, I feel so wonderful that I have chosen to make this a permanent lifestyle change!  I mean, why stop when I feel this fabulous?!  And deprivation played no part in my lifestyle makeover.  In fact, I feel like I have never eaten so well & never felt so nourished.  Living this way is actually FUN!  Kris explains that this way of living isn't about \\"giving up\\" anything; instead, it's about minimizing the not-so-good-for-us stuff, while maximizing the great-for-us stuff.  There is so much deliciousness going on that I haven't once missed the old junk that I thought I \\"couldn't live without!\\"    Don't even think twice about buying this book.  Do yourself a favor & just go for it!  It is so good that you will have a hard time putting it down - and once you finish, you'll read it again & again!    Peace, love & veggies!
0811847365|5.0|Wildlife of Star Wars is one of my favourite of all Star Wars reference books. The thought and imagination that has gone into this book is excellent as are the fantastic illustrations. A how to of making your own world and seeing how creatures interact within a habitat is a great learning experience for all ages. As a primary teacher this is a great book for boy and girls to stretch their imaginations and to see some astounding artwork. My only downside is when there will be another volume with some other wild and wonderful creatures and habitats from the Star Wars galaxy. I already have the hardcover edition for home and this one is going straight into my classroom. 10 out of five!
B002JVWR4U|5.0|If you flipped on this show out of nowhere - in the middle of an episode - it would look completely retarded and you'd have no clue what was going on. It's actually pretty different from Whedon's usual stuff - no demons, vampires, lesbians - and okay no one's going to win \\"Best Actor\\" off it but it's actually really good. The idea is pretty awesome, to begin with, and although Whedon throws you around a lot, it's fun to watch and even better once you understand what's going on. Obviously you should watch season 1 first, but I liked season 2. I only wish there'd been more! I can't wait to see what Whedon does next... although Buffy's pretty hard to beat.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|At a certain point in Wilco's career, didn't the insanity have to stop?<br /><br />Known for creating messed-up, art-rock masterpieces like Hotel Yankee Fox Trot and a Ghost Is Born, didn't Wilco have a to sit down and just right a good rock record? You know, one you could put on Saturday afternoon and chill with? In Sky Blue Sky we get the sound of a band relaxing and stretching out into a beautifully constructed set of mellow rock gold.<br /><br />Now this being Wilco their amazing musicianship still shines through, the guitar playing on Impossible Germany being that rare example of a superbly crafted, dense, yet simple tune. But throughout all of Sky Blue Sky Wilco courageously rejects the ideals of alt-rock superiority, to just allow them to be the chilled 70's sounding rock band even their most arty of records shows can't really hide.

B000005Z0E|1.0|Bad digital copy, one of the songs was incomplete,and the cover was made out of the same material as a cereal box with a photocopy of the original CD taped on the front. I ordered this CD to build my collection. It was cheap but now I have to go buy it again. Very disappointed
B0009VBTA0|4.0|I just rediscovered this cd after not listening to it for I don't know how long.  I am reminded that one of the things that sets Andreas Vollenweider apart from other new age artist is that his music while relaxing, still has momentum and diversity.  Not just another boring ride through snoozville. I also liked white winds, and down to the moon.  Dancing with the lion was pretty good.
B000002GYR|5.0|My introduction to Tom Waits was back in 1975 and I was hooked. His voice, lyrics and music were perfect for what you'd want to be listening to late at night in exactly the sort of settings he painted with each wonderful tune. He captured the mood of late night perfectly. Heart of Saturday Night was the first album of his that I purchased, and then this one.    After these two albums his voice became gruffer and more gritty, the songs (to me, anyway) less melodic and they lost the balance that the first two displayed. Well, this review is not about the later ones, it's about the first one, Closing Time, and its a masterpiece.  His voice and phrasing fit the images, melodies and lyrics perfectly and this is one very well-balanced album.
0307266303|5.0|The quality of the copy was indeed \\"like new\\". Superb read. Quality inspiration for the inspirable and a fun read for even a stubborn, skeptic, fatty.
B003VB5E2E|5.0|I am not a huge blues fan, so this review comes from the perspective of someone who is not real familiar with many of the artists featured in this concert. That said, I enjoyed most of it. Some of the artists and music I liked better than others but then that's to be expected when you have a variety like this.  Many of the reviewers will give you their opinions (which some seem to feel are fact) as to which performances were the best but what one person thinks was great will be what someone else feels is not so great. All I can say is there is enough here for everyone and you'll wind up liking some parts better than others.<br /><br />I purchased the Blu Ray version and the sound and picture are excellent, especially the sound. This is one to really turn up loud. Now that I've seen the entire concert, I'll skip a few parts next time around but overall this is one great disc and highly recommended. The level of musicianship was very high.

B00004R99J|1.0|This DVD looks like it has been recorded off of video.  The images are not crisp and motion has interesting color changes.
B0018BXMXW|4.0|This mini-lp replica sleeve version (mlps) of Focus' most popular album is a real treat for fans as it has been very well designed and assembled and the K2 HD mastering treatment has improved the sound quality a great deal as well.  Most people are familiar with the powerhouse rocker \\"Hocus Pocus\\" but to judge the whole album on just their most popular hit single would be inaccurate.  We get some classical influences on \\"Le Clochard\\" and some jazz fusion influences throughout and indeed the other tracks are not as hard rock power-driven as the opening track but are more mellow and varied.  In fact, I was reminded of King Crimson's work on \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" on some of the tracks as well as of some of Yes' better works.<br /><br />It is safe to say that if you are looking for just one album that showcases Focus at their best this one would be it.<br /><br />Great mlps design, great content and excellent remastered sound quality makes this a worthwhile addition to any fan of progressive rock's sonic library.<br /><br />Recommended.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Horror fans around the world cried foul when the phenomenal Swedish vampire tale LET THE RIGHT ONE IN was scheduled for an American remake within one year of its DVD release. Thankfully, writer/director Matt Reeves manages to pull together an equally beautiful film that retains the heart and soul of the original in its overall mood and aesthetic. LET ME IN follows Owen, a shy boy who is constantly tormented by his peers. When a strange young girl moves in next door, the two bond out of their shared loneliness to form a close friendship. What Owen doesn't know is that his new playmate is an ageless vampire, and that she is sustaining herself on the blood of their neighbors. Reeves uses the same drained color palette and restrained shooting style that can be found in Alfredson's film, filling each scene with cold blues and muted browns in order to give LET ME IN a bleak but timeless look and feel. Its story and characters share the same level of warmth and depth from before, brought over from the portion of John Ajvide Lindqvist's original screenplay that was left intact. This would have meant nothing without the stellar leads played by Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chloe Moretz, who bring the characters to life with a pair of incredible performances from such young actors. With few exceptions, LET ME IN also remains as subtle and effective as LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, however there are a few moments that have been cheapened through the unnecessary use of computerization. These minor trespasses are easier to overlook when Reeves has gone to such great lengths to honor and respect the film's source material. In the end, LET ME IN proves to be one of the most confident and skillful remakes to come out in recent years, yet it still begs the question \\"Why?\\" when so little has been changed. Still, it more than serves its purpose in retelling the same exact story for lazy American audiences that can't be bothered with subtitles.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B002ZG98C8|5.0|Usually, ultra-violence leaves me cold, but this masterpiece of retro 70's action and Spaghetti Westerns, had my laughing as Machete slashed his way to my heart.  As a Texan, this film was not only campy, funny and enjoyable; it also had ring a truth to it. Except, all the militia guys here in Texas are from Michigan. Also, the Mexicans, rarely hang at those day labourer places. Most already have jobs lined up, as depicted in fellow Austinite Richard Linkleter's Fast Food Nation.  Corrupt Politicians and law enforcement working with Drug Cartels. That plot seems pretty right to me, and its not even supposed to be taken seriously.  To me, this was the best of Grindhouse films.  It was so nice seeing Danny Trejo as the good guy and lovable. I can't wait for Machete Kills Again!
0439023521|5.0|In the distant future, the former United States has become the nation of Panem-- a collection of 12 districts ruled by an omnipotent Capitol. Every year the Capitol requires the each district to provide one boy and one girl tribute for the Hunger Games as punishment for a rebellion led 75 years ago by a mysterious 13th district. In the Games, the 24 tributes fight until only one victor remains alive, and the entire event is televised for the Capitol's viewing pleasure.        This tyrannical political environment is the backdrop for Suzanne Collin's The Hunger Games trilogy. The series follows the adventures of Katniss Everdeen, who gets pulled in to the violence and political intrigue of the Games when she volunteers as a tribute to save her little sister, Prim.        What truly impressed me about this book is that Katniss is such an incredibly written female character. She is the primary provider for her household, and she does this by hunting wild game outside of the fence surrounding her home in District 8. Not only is she a well-trained and talented archer, she has a keen survivalist instinct that actually makes her a contender in the Hunger Games-- something very uncommon with tributes from her district.  Katniss' only flaw-- if you can call it that-- is that she is emotionally unaware. Most of the conflict in the book (aside from the obvious) has to do with her misunderstanding other people's intentions, her difficulty in forgiving others, and not being sure how she really feels. This makes her a non-stereotypical heroine in my opinion. Women are usually squishy and dramatic, but Katniss is neither. She is bold, brash, and spunky. She is also unfailingly loyal to her friends and family. Katniss' character manages to be noble without being annoying, which makes it easy for the reader to cheer her on through the ordeal.       The male characters are generally less complex, but they are far more emotionally aware than Katniss, which makes for an interestingdynamic. Gale Hawthorne is Katniss' friend and hunting partner from District 8. He too supports his family since his father and Katniss' father were killed in a mine accident several years ago. Frustrated with conditions in District 8, Gale uses their time outside of the fence to vent and say things that would be considered very treacherous. Opposite Gale is Peeta Mellark, the son of a baker, who becomes Katniss' fellow tribute in the Games. He is a quiet fellow who inadvertently gave Katniss the will to survive when her father died. Although Katniss doesn't know Peeta well, he has a lot more going on beneath his quiet exterior than she knows.       The characters spark, and the narrative catches fire. Everything in this book is dynamic and thrilling. Even the most reserved characters have a strength and a will that make them incredibly compelling.  Readers will find themselves swept up by the story in no time-- The Hunger Games trilogy is truly a high-interest read.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It took me to long or me to get a hold on this book and the time I red it in impressed even me!!! But, seriously I'm so glad Rick Riordan decided to write books, otherwise I'd probably hate reading. Thanks a lot man YOU ROCK RIORDAN!!!!!!!!!
B004132HZS|4.0|This entertaining dvd contains three episodes:<br /><br />1.  A Study In Pink - a dead woman wearing pink is found and Sherlock Holmes solves the mystery.<br />2.  The Blind Banker - a banker is murdered and Holmes gets the killer.<br />3.  The Great Game - various murders take place and yet again, Holmes solves the mystery.<br /><br />Admittingly, this took a little getting used to since I have seen so many of the Basil Rathbone movies.  The new actors are entertaining, though, and I did enjoy the three episodes.<br /><br />Will be interesting to see if another season will be produced.<br /><br />In the meantime, watch and enjoy the newest edition of Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Recommended.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Thought-provoking, witty, moving... Not only is this movie full of genuine laughs and both heart-warming and heart-breaking moments, but it offers a fabulous social commentary as well. The movie is well cast, with some great moments by Stanley Tucci, and has fabulous character development. As Olive says in the opening minutes of the film, it's not another angst-y coming-of-age high school drama. It's not often that I find a movie that is smart, funny, compelling, and empowering. As soon as it's over, I'm ready to watch it again.<br /><br />\\"Easy A\\" gets an easy A+ from me!
B002ZFQD0O|4.0|`Elect the Dead Symphony' is Serj Tankians reworking of his `Elect the Dead' album and is performed with the Auckland Philharmonia orchestra. The first thing I noticed is that this is much better arranged than the similarly themed `S&M' album from Metallica. Whereas that album sounded like a string tribute album with the band playing along, `Elect the Dead Symphony' is much better arranged so that it has better flow and more impact. This is in no way just a classical version of the original album, it is a credible reworking and new musical offering in it's own right. There are two new tracks to keep existing fans interested and they fit in well and stand up on their own merit. The booklet is excellent and despite the awful digi-pack format this makes for a good overall package; especially when you take into account that this features an audio CD and DVD as well. Great value for money in anyone's eyes. To be wholly honest Serj's voice doesn't always suit the music and whilst his surreal and unique vocals sit well with SOAD albums or his own rock albums, sometimes they stray just a little too much for comfort. This is a minor niggle though and doesn't detract from the feel of the album. If you are a fan of Serj then this will be a delight and will be an excellent stop gap until the next album comes along, but if you are new to his work then I suggest you try the original album first to then fully appreciate this when you come to it down the line.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is truly my favorite adaptation of A Christmas Carol. Michael Caine is perfect, you forget he's one of the few humans in the story. Great music too.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|From the impressive opening sequence you suspect that `Star Trek' will be something special and by the time the end credits have started to roll you will know it for a certainty. As far as sci-fi films go this is outstanding. You get a great storyline, amazing space scenes and CGI and good acting from all involved. This film is a prequel to all the Star trek films that already exist and this introduces us to all of the crew we know and love. It even shows how some of them grew up and how they met one another. The casting is excellent, especially the actor who plays Spock, and there is even a cameo from Leonard Nimoy. This shows how Kirk started off as an impetuous and even arrogant cadet and gives us an insight into his character that is evident in later films. This is a good film in it's own right and adds to the series exceptionally well. There are plenty of classic lines and in-jokes for existing trekkie fans and action and adventure for those new to the franchise. This is a top sci-fi adventure and an engaging film and is well worth checking out at some point. P.S. the space scenes on Blu-Ray are especially impressive if you get the chance to view this in that format.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1594202842|4.0|It doesn't surprise me in the least that so many people have opinions about this book. It appears that there is a confusion of literary genres in this country. How many books were published that went out to prove how false [[ASIN:B001IC0I7E The Da Vinci Code]] is, even though it is a fiction book? Errant book reviewers have done it once again. They've assumed that Amy Chua's new book, \\"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother\\" isn't a \\"how-to\\" book on parenting. In reality, it's a memoir, and an engaging, confrontational, and ultimately rich read of the life of a family navigating its way through the complexities of parenting.<br /><br />No doubt many reviewers haven't actually read the book, but read an \\"excerpt\\" of a list found in the book that Chua states are \\"rules for parenting\\". However, reading that and judging the book is like taking a single passage out of the Bible and saying we understand God. Amy Chua purposefully chose to raise her two daughters, Sophia and Louisa (called Lulu) using the Chinese parenting style she grew up under. Her daughters grew into musical virtuosos in their respective instruments, piano and violin. But as Chua readily admits, and it simmers through the book, her style of parenting led to disharmony with her youngest daughter Lulu, until she finally had to give in.<br /><br />Chua doesn't mince words as a mother. Reading her honest confession, it sometimes comes across as harsh in the ways she addresses her kids. She justifies some of the more painful interactions with proof of the success of her children. Both musiclally gifted, they achieve high honors early in their careers. Chua wouldn't accept anything less.<br /><br />It was also clear to Chua to distinguish between \\"Western\\" style parenting and Chinese parenting. Here is probably the harshest part of the book, and ultimately why I reduced my rating down a star. Clearly, Chua's disdain over Western style parenting techniques shows up on many of the pages. She needed to do so to justify her choices as a Chinese parent. However, it runs the risk of alienating some of the audience that would have reacted more kindly to the book. However, Chua is merely being honest.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|When you talk about classic animation it doesn't get much more revered or classic than `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. The animation here is simply beautiful, even by today's standards, and this is all the more impressive when you take into account the year this was made, 1937. Even better, it is now digitally restored for it's latest release. This is a wonderful fairytale that is full of charm, none of which has diminished over time. This has the delightful dwarf characters and each one adds something unique to the film, of course Dopey is the most hilarious and the one that had me laughing out loud regularly. These dwarfs have now become representative of Disney's early art and are still seen around the parks and on advertising even today. This film has a dark edge to the story that is lacking from the saccharine modern Disney films and this darkness compliments and highlights the light in the rest of the film and in my opinion it is all the better for it. There are nice animated touches throughout, like the detailed carvings in the dwarf house and the forest animals expressions and actions and show the attention to detail Disney brought to his films. This package includes various extras and games, most of which are aimed at kids, but there is a commentary by Walt Disney that is fascinating and of interest to an adult audience. All in all this is classic and beautiful film and well worth adding to your Disney collection.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

I don't read a lot of books of this type, but Ken Follett got  my attention a long time ago with a book he wrote, so I always check out his new ones, I got a sample on my Kindle, and I was totally hooked.
B001MW0IY8|4.0|Although `The Crying Light' is another good album from Antony and the Johnsons, I have found it moves me a lot less than `I am a Bird Now' or their debut. It's hard to put your finger on quite why this is so as it has a similar feel to the other two albums and you still get Antony's unique vocals and song-writing style, but something seems to be missing this time round. But only slightly. The strings are more to the fore on this album and really shine through throughout making things sound more lush and they compliment everything perfectly. My favourite track has to be `Another World' where Antony's voice and the piano together sound raw and heartfelt, just like how I adore from the previous albums. This was a long time in the making and for fans of Antony and the Johnsons this will be as worthy addition to your collection, but if you are new to them then I suggest you try `I Am A Bird Now' first and then come to this at a later date. Overall this is a solid album.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

It does not make the work simple it just tells you what to do step by step and shows you what each thing looks like. All the projects are rated for difficulty. It is up to you to decide whether to tackle these feats. Also, it can give you a great deal of knowledge about what the person working on your vehicle is going to have to do.

So we went and bought the CD somewhere else. Giving 5 star rating because I love the CD but if it was for service it would obviously be zero.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This film is labeled a documentary, but its entire format is really that of a sermon by Rev. Algore. There is very little documentary here. Included are also occasional testimonials by supposedly notable figures. There is much political jabbing, some of which is justified, but most of which is not. Approximately 95% of the entire film has at least 40% of the screen filled with Rev. Algore's face. There are multiple clips that just don't relate to the thesis of global warming, such as a complaint about how the votes were tallied in Florida, with the subsequent Supreme Court ruling, and no explanation as to what this had to do with the \\"inconvenient truth\\" of this film. The film is entirely about global warming, but unknowingly shows how Rev. Algore is particularly skilled at depleting carbon units, although he is exempt since he alone is allowed to consume mass quantities of energy. I can't imagine the energy required to run Rev. Algore under the North Pole in a nuclear submarine and surface through the ice, just to add a 2 minute episode to the sermon. I could go on and on. Rev. Algore sanctimoniously suggests that the family farm quit growing tobacco because of the concern over lung cancer, yet it almost certainly was a result of declining reimbursements from tobacco. Rev. Algore's tone of voice, inflections, and speaking style were much more like a sermon than a documentary. The fools who gave this film an Academy Award fail to offer how this film stood out in quality and credible research. The entire thesis of the film is based on supposed rising atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, while Rev. Algore maintains a schoolboy belief in the accuracy and significance of the data and its extrapolations, without any questioning of the data. It shows the absurd fallacy of having a lawyer/politician pretend to be doing credible science. There is no doubt that there is some truth to what Rev. Algore is saying. There is a retreat of glaciers in the last few decades. There are certain interesting climate changes. Yet, Rev. Algore fails to substantiate the exact causal nature of these events, and chooses instead to promote emotionalism and extreme reactions, exactly what he accuses the Republican party of doing, though on other issues. If Rev. Algore didn't make so many hard jabs at his political opponents, he might have gained a few more sympathetic ears. Making the weather a political rather than a pure environmental issue makes Rev. Algore ineffective and suspect as to his true intentions for making this film. It is thus hard for me to give this film even one star. It is not worth purchasing, though a single viewing is of value only to see the many gorgous faces of Rev. Algore. Global warming supporters may have a credible argument, but it certainly is not given in this film.re certain interesting climate changes. Yet, Rev.

0553805371|4.0|The Grand Design by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow mostly succeeds at being accessible to the average reader given the academic subject matter. Still, it was hard to wrap my mind around some of the concepts. The examples were clear, but like physics itself, understanding them often required thinking in multiple dimensions.<br /><br />This book, as others like it, is a welcomed continual plea to bring scientific thinking to the greater public. The world surprisingly still leans heavily on superstition in trying to make sense of this mysterious space called the universe.

B003L20IJM|5.0|I loved the first movie and love Emma Thompson, so I was anxious to see this sequel and was not disappointed, nor were my children.  The story takes place with a different family, but pulls aspects from the first family into this film.  The lessons learned are the moral ethical lessons we all need to be reminded of.  Courage, bravery, loyalty, sharing, forgiving, humor and humility are all there. There is a menagerie of animals and antics along with the most colorful of characters that will leave you delighted and tearful - I cried twice.  My \\"8\\" and \\"10\\" year old loved this movie, so this is one we will purchase.  Enjoy!
0060763280|4.0|The most valuable part for me was Wealth File #11 \\"Rich People choose to get paid based on results, Poor People choose to get paid based on time\\". Just like Gordan Gekko said in [[ASIN:B004A2AN5G Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]<br />\\"the one thing I learned in jail is that money is not the prime asset in life. Time is.\\"<br /><br />This book also had a chapter than reminded me that Rich people don't run from problems. Rich people are bigger than their problems while poor people are smaller than their problems. This is great advice that I can actually used next time I run into a problem, will I back down from the problem thinking I can't solve it or will I bear down and realize I am bigger than my problems.<br /><br />Once you hit the The Ice-Cream cone analogy the book will probably click for you. I don't want to spoil it for those who will read it but trust me this analogy will be with you for life once you read through the book. The book was interesting enough that I was able to push through it in just two days. Each chapter was great advice that made me realize how much of my thinking dated back to what I had seen growing up.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B004DK49DW|3.0|Social Distortion's [[ASIN:B00000272D self-titled 1990 release]] ranks as one of my favorite albums ever, so I snapped this up as soon as I could. Unfortunately, there's no way I can listen to this without comparing it to that.<br /><br />While still unmistakably Social D, their new sound is more bluesy, more twangy, and less aggressive than the whiskey bottle through the window rock `n' roll of my (their) youth, sharing more with [[ASIN:B000001Y1N the Wallflowers]] than [[ASIN:B000002LDX the Ramones]]. Track one, an instrumental, is my favorite, as it retains more of their raw power and lacks the hackneyed lyrics found elsewhere on the album. Still, I have to show some love for the [[ASIN:B000005DQ5 Hank Williams]] cover and a couple of the tracks are catchy, if not particularly punk... were those gospel singers on backup?<br /><br />Three-and-a-half stars from me, but you might like the \\"mature\\" sound more.

B002ZG99A4|5.0|I sometimes cringe when I see movies that are loaded down with big name actors.

The development of each character came along in a fairly natural way.      Rewatchability of this movie: *****

B002E01LTI|4.0|After reading many of the reviews and especially those made for the Blu-ray release, I felt I needed to comment as I found a lot of opinions, but few that summarized what I wanted to know. That said, I am not rating the movie itself; you're big boys and girls and can make those decisions yourself. I am rating the quality of the product.<br /><br />Is it better video quality than the DVD version? Yes. A DVD is lower resolution and has been compressed (i.e. data discarded causing loss of picture quality) to fit on a DVD disc. It can potentially be compressed even more to allow for extras. The Blu-ray was taken from the same master copy as the DVD and was upconverted. This means the Blu-ray version is of better quality than the upconverted DVD. Since I own both DVD and Blu-ray editions, I can confirm the quality is better, looking at items such as faint wisps of smoke, sparks shooting from dying vamps, sharpness between light and dark colors, reflected images, etc.<br /><br />If you are someone who buys movies more for the other stuff on the disc, you will be disappointed as there is no menu or extras. It shows a screen where the menu would be stating the move will begin in moments. Once it starts, you only have the basic control menu (up arrow menu). Also, this is just an upconverted version with no new remastering so some items will still be a little blurry on the edges (like some of the closer sparks when a vamp dies).<br /><br />All in all, I had to give this product 4 stars. I subtracted 2 stars from 5 because it was not remastered nor had extras, but added 1 star because they gambled and released it on Blu-ray in this economy and after Wesley's incarceration.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Let's be brief; there's plenty of long reviews to read. The DVD picture quality is great; a preserve format of the theater, so it does have the landscape bars top and bottom; but otherwise, the details are really sharp.  Next, Best Buy & Target have the same price, $16+, so unless you're combining for free shipping, enjoy instant gratification by buying from a 'brick & mortar'. Next, the Blu-Ray comes with two (2) discs:  Disc #1 includes a great commentary track with (Golden Globe winning) director, David Fincher and another track with (Golden Globe winning) writer, Aaron Sorkin; Disc #2 has a 'making of' and a 'facebook featurette'.     Even having just the (Golden Globe winning) movie is well worth the price!     In the past, I've found that a great way to be introduced to great artists and products is through statements made in related product reviews?  A recent song by Joey Contreras, sung by Marla Mindelle, titled \\"[[ASIN:B004F8XZQO My Simple Request]]\\", uses \\"Facebook\\" as its backdrop to tell a story of desire & obsession, with a twist of humor. Enjoyable to share with family & friends, or anyone who uses \\"Facebook\\".

031603438X|4.0|Let me get this straight right away.  This book is a must read for any Rolling Stones fan.  It was entertaining throughout.  However, as you will see, I had hoped it would even be better.    A few questions always springs to mind when I start reading a biography like this one.  First, there is always a co-author for such books.  You can't exactly picture Keith tapping away at a laptop for months on end, now can you?  Such a book is made by the co-author interviewing the subject at length and then shaping the recordings of those interviews into a written draft, which the subject then reviews and edits.  So clearly, the co-authors have to work well together in order to create a good final product.  You wonder if the co-author will retain \\"the voice\\" of the subject in shaping the writing.  The reader will certainly benefit from having a book that is lucid and articulate, but you want it to sound genuine as well.     \\"Life\\" is very good in this regard.  You feel that you are sitting with Keith, listening to him tell his story.  Too bad the audio book version is read by Johnny Depp.  I'd like to hear Keith reading it to complete the picture!  So the book is genuine.  You hear blunt, salty language throughout, but also real affection for lots of people, and a real love of music.     Next, you wonder initially will the book heavily focus on \\"gossipy\\" anecdotes to the detriment of discussions of the subject's real accomplishments, inspirations and passions?    In this case, folks who are casual Rolling Stones or even casual music fans may be interested in buying a book to hear what it is like to be the world's most famous junkie, but would probably be bored with discussions of Keith's use of open tunings or how specific songs were composed and recorded.  They would want to hear about Keith's feuds with Mick Jagger and Brian Jones, his \\"adventures\\" with Anita Pallenberg, but probably not care about what his favorite gigs were and why.     Here, I think \\"Life\\" is better thanthe average celebrity autobiography.  It is way better in this regard while discussing the 1960's.  Richards talks a lot about his love for Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter and other Chicago Blues artists, as well as Chuck Berry.  He describes how open tunings became prevalent in early blues recordings, and that trying to replicate the sounds he heard in those recordings sparked the evolution of his own playing style.  He describes writing \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Gimme Shelter\\" among others.  However, once you get past \\"Exile on Main Street\\", much of these insights regarding the Rolling Stones disappear.  They reappear regarding Richards side projects, like his work on the Chuck Berry concert film \\"Hail Hail Rock n Roll\\", his first album (\\"Talk is Cheap\\") and tour with the X-Pensive Winos and his recording of Jamaican musicians \\"Wingless Angels\\".  Those accounts are great, but hardly discussing Stones albums and tours in any depth from the mid-70s on, certainly makes them feel insignificant to Keith.  I'd be surprised if that were really true, but when all Keith has to say regarding the \\"Some Girls\\" tour is \\"we were rehearsing for the 1978 tour in Woodstock, New York.\\", and when he never mentions \\"Tattoo You\\" at all (an album that I love), it sure seems that way.     Anyway, Keith doesn't gloss over any of his \\"questionable\\" behavior, and rarely apologizes for any of it either.  You definitely hear a lot about Richards drug escapades, his scrapes with the law and his periodic attempts to clean up.  He describes life in the South of France as a tax exile and target of police interest around the world.  You hear about how he takes his 7 year old son, Marlon,  on tour and how they take turns looking after each other.  Keith obviously makes many choices that most of us wouldn't, however he never comes across as malicious.  He marches to the beat of his own drum throughout, without seeming to notice how irresponsible some of his behavior seems to most others.    Again, much of it is fascinating, and essential reading for any Rolling Stones fan, however, I feel that the music was slightly short changed.  I do recognize that the published book is 576 pages long, and that the publishers probably couldn't accept it any longer.  However, I still would have preferred that Keith describe the inspiration, writing, recording and the place in rock history of every song he has ever done.  Ideally, just adding this to the current book.  If that added 200 pages, what do I care, I read it on my Sony e-reader anyway.  It  wouldn't weigh any more!    To be fair, Keith's book is better in this regard than Ronnie Wood's autobiography \\"Ronnie\\".  That book talks far less about the music.  However, still a fascinating read for Stones fans or general British rock fans, as Wood hung out and/or played with everyone!    There are a few books that I have read that have explored the music to the extent that I am looking for, although only one does this in the context of a biography.  That book is \\"Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now\\" by Barry Miles.  Miles, an old friend of Paul, the other Beatles and many British rock musicians, built this book using extensive interviews of McCartney conducted in the 1990's.  Basically, Miles sets up the context of each facet of Paul's and the Beatles story, and then drops in long McCartney quotes telling his remembrances of each event.  Regarding the music, Paul describes the writing of virtually every Lennon/McCartney composed Beatles song. That facet is what is missing from Keith's book.    Some other books that explore this territory in a satisfying way, in my opinion, are Paul Williams series of \\"Bob Dylan: Performing Artist\\", volumes 1, 2 and 3.  Williams isn't interested in gossip at all, and biography only to the extent that it relates to the music.  Williams' insights and enthusiasm are infectious and guaranteed to boost anyone's understanding and appreciation of the music of Bob Dylan.     Bottom line: good book Keith, Stones fans will love it, but can you follow up \\"Keith Richards: Life\\" with \\"Keith Richards: Music\\" which talks about ALL the music!

B003L20ICE|5.0|The Kids Are All Right tells the story of a lesbian couple with two children that were conceived via anonymous sperm donor, but it succeeds by telling it in the same way it would if the couple had been heterosexual. Director/co-writer Lisa Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg make their lesbian couple no different from a typical married couple and largely avoid the clichés that could cause this film to be labeled a \\"gay movie.\\"    Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) are a married couple living in California with their two children Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson). Nic is a doctor, while Jules is trying to establish herself as a landscape designer after several failed business ventures. Their marriage is a bit rocky, but they have two well-rounded, intelligent children conceived via anonymous sperm donor. Laser, at 15, has grown curious about his mystery father and asks his 18-year-old sister to find out who the man is. Leaving for college soon, she reluctantly agrees. The donor in question is Paul (Mark Ruffalo), unmarried, with no children, the owner of an organic restaurant, and naturally curious about these two kids. Joni and Laser find him cool and likable, but agree that their moms must not find out. When they do find out, they insist that Paul is invited over for dinner. Paul is so likable that only Nic remains skeptical of the man.    The film is a comedy, but its humor stems from the characters' sense of humor rather than just exploiting the characters by putting them in humorous situations. The tone is kept light, never getting too heavy but Cholodenko knows not to let dramatic opportunities go to waste. With that said, the film never overdoes the emotional stuff. Where most movies allow an emotional holocaust to unfold whenever a character finds out something devastating, The Kids Are All Right has characters that react much like real people would which makes the emotional scenes very effective and very affecting.    WhileI don't consider it a misstep per se, infidelity does factor into the plot. This is something we've seen countless times, but it's handled much better than it could've been here. While not always unpredictable and fresh, I found this film so charming, funny, and inspired I can forgive it for being occasionally overly familiar. What this film has is a good script with great characters enriched by how great they're played by the actors involved.    Nic and Jules have been married for nearly twenty years, a marriage which Bening and Moore make believable. They're not a perfect couple, but they're not constantly at odds with each other either. They convey the believability of their relationship with body language and their general attitude towards each other; assisted by the great dialogue they're given. Both Moore and Bening are perfect and I'd be torn to choose who gives the better performance. They both avoid the stereotypes, never emphasizing how taboo their characters may seem to some, and they bring such humor and humanity to their roles while playing them as very normal people; two people who are married, have real emotions, and are struggling to do what's right while working through a rough patch in their relationship.     Mark Ruffalo is almost exclusively responsible for the likability of Paul. The role seems simple enough, but it's easy to see where another actor could have brought the wrong nuance to the role and seemed immoral and somewhat immature rather than laid-back and comfortable with himself. His final scene in the film is remarkable; despite his mistakes, you can't help feel some empathy for him. Ruffalo brings out Paul's emotions in a way you really believe someone like Paul would and the way he smiles at Laser in the last moments of the scene brings a terrific amount of closure to his character. If Ruffalo and Bening are nominated for an Academy Award, this is the scene where Oscar voters would decide that. Ruffalo makes Paul one of the most likable characters of 2010 and gives the rare kind of performance that doesn't need to be explosively dramatic to get recognition during awards season.     The Kids Are All Right is a funny, at times touching film driven by its exceptionable cast. With a lesser cast, I admit this may have been a lesser film but sometimes everything just aligns perfectly. This is one of my favorite films of 2010, with a cast doing some great work that I hope will be recognized. It's not a perfect film, but it does so many things right that other films of this kind get wrong.    GRADE: A-

B002ZG99QS|5.0|I loved the original and I can say that this movie is an excellent sequel.  They added depth to the world by better showing the civilization in the computer world.      There is more action than in the original as well but not overwelming so as to detract from the story.  Once again there is the lightcycle and disk battles on the game grid.  Those are a little bit longer than the original (I always wished the original had more) but with better graphics these are very nice.    The decisions for the actors/actresses I feel was very good.  Bringing back Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner works very well for bridging with the original movie.  Garrett Hedland performed well.  Olivia Wild was excellent and I thought she was beautiful in this movie.    There is a story here with substance to it and it was thoroughly enjoyable.  I hope you will enjoy it as well.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Some of the images are so intense I would not recommend this for small or extremely sensitive children.  I found this series even better watching it the second time around because I was able to follow the characters a little bit better.  Sometimes its hard to tell who is who when everyone is wearing military issue.  My husband is a WWII  buff as his father was stationed in the Pacific during the war.  His father rarely talked to him about the war time experience and now he has a better idea why.  So glad this was completed while some of the men were still alive to get their personal perspectives as well.
1584282584|4.0|This is a short, easy-to-read book with good, practical advice on using on-camera flash. The only other *good* book I've read on flash so far is Joe McNally's \\"Hot Shoe Diaries\\", which is excellent. I found myself comparing these books after having read them both.<br /><br />The technical information presented at the beginning of the book was pretty good, and on par with other books I have read.  I found it interesting how McNally's technique is quite different than van Niekerk's. Granted, \\"Hot Shoe Diaries\\" really focuses almost exclusively on off-camera flash(es!), and this book is about on-camera flash, but still, the choice of camera modes and techniques to measure exposure are very different. For example, Van Niekerk recommends the Zone System and manual exposure, and McNally recommends using aperture priority and using the camera's matrix metering. To each his own, I guess.<br /><br />I found the chapter on flash sync to be decent, but not as clear as it could have been. The chapter on light modifiers was pretty thin. Some of the example pictures near the beginning of the book I found difficult to relate to (since it seemed they weren't always apples-to-apples comparisons). There was a panel of images that was supposed to show varying the degree of ambient light, which I expected to show differences in shutter speed, but it showed comparisons of different apertures (which obviously affects DOF).<br /><br />The rest of the book is purely about how you should be bouncing the flash to get best results. There are some good examples given throughout the book showing ambient light, the setting, and the shot with and without flash, to really give you a good feeling of what's going on from the point of view of the photographer (and not just the final picture). Not every example is like this (it'd be nicer to have more). On the other hand, some examples did give the different view points, but it didn't always add to the explanation (sometimes, it was puzzling exactly what the picutre of the environment was supposed to show).<br /><br />I liked how this book shows some good examples of how a single on-camera flash combined with cheap gels and light shapers, can produce very good results if used properly. This is unlike McNally's book, which shows great images (often stunning!), but McNally is often using much more expensive equipment (even with just one flash, most picutres from the \\"Hot Shoe Diaries\\" use diffusers, panels, umbrellas, and other gear to get everything \\"just right\\"). I realize that again, it's difficult to compare, since that book is most about off-camera flash.<br /><br />All in all, this was a great read. Recommended.environment was supposed to show).

B002UXRGM0|5.0|Tried to watch this on Discovery Channel and became sick to my stomach with the nursery rhyme tactics of Oprah Winfrey attempting to narrate as a clueless naturalist. So I waited for the Blu-Ray to my great satisfaction. David Attenborough<br />never ceases to amaze me with his enthusiasm for the natural world. This series delves more deeply than Planet Earth into the animals and wildlife of this spinning green, blue ball. The filming is breathtaking and eye mesmerizing! Learning from the Planet Earth series they now included the making of diaries on the Blu-Ray, which they left off of the BR on Planet Earth. BBC continue to be top notch! Not sure what will happen if David Attenborough ever leaves this planet earth, I just hope Oprah does not replace him in the narrative department. What a sad planet that would be!
0698400852|4.0|Dicken's \\"A Christmas Carol\\" should be read by everyone who loves Christmas (and everyone who doesn't) at least once a year but, each year is even better.  This particular version/printing is one that should be treasured and passed down from generation to generation as the illustrations are lovely!
B004AHNIGM|5.0|In the liner notes for \\"Low country blues\\", Robert Gordon writes \\"A river runs through the blues, and Gregg Allman continues to navigate it. This album deposits Gregg at a fresh place on the bank. He's a traveler, sometimes riding with the current, swimming upstream when he prefers\\".      This new release is proof of the success of Gregg's journey. When I received my copy of \\"Low country\\", I sat uninterrupted through all twelve tracks. Twice. Some musical projects are memorable for well written songs, thoughtful sequencing and great instrumentation. Others are so complete, so satisfying that you just don't want to listen to anything else for a while. \\"Low country\\" falls into the latter category.       Ace producer T-bone Burnett is also responsible for B.B. King's latest, the wonderful \\"One kind favor\\".That disc kicks off with a very dark version of Blind Lemon Jefferson's \\"See that my grave is kept clean\\". The opener for this disc, Sleepy John Estes' \\"Floating Bridge\\" is a song similar in format, but where \\"Favor\\" is a plea, \\"Bridge\\" is a bitter recollection. Both songs, and on both cds, the presence of Dr. John's masterful piano is as important as that of the stars.        \\"Little by little\\" is a Junior Wells staple that starts off with a funky B-3 intro by Gregg, then features more of the good Doctor with great guitar fills by Doyle Bramhall II. \\"Devil got my woman\\" shows Burnett's greatest strength as a roots music producer- the ability to take a Skip James song from the 1930's and remake it in 2011-without sacrificing any integrity. Gregg's vocals are almost ethereal, with dual guitar interplay between Bramhall and Colin Linden on Dobro.         \\"I can't be satisfied\\" is one of Muddy Waters' most beloved compositions, and Gregg and company do this song justice while showcasing the groove created by drummer Jay Belrose and bassist Dennis Crouch.         \\"Blind man\\" is the first appearance on the disc of trumpeter Darrell Leonard's horn section. Leonard has beenrecording for years with tenor sax player Joe Sublett as the Texacali Horns. Here they're augmented by Lester Lovitt and Daniel Fornero on trumpet with Thomas Peterson and Jim Thompson on baritone and tenor sax. The horns appear on five other tracks giving the disc a powerful classic r&b punch, especially on B.B. King's \\"Please accept my love\\".          The sole original on the disc, \\"Just another rider\\" was co-written with Gregg's partner in the Allman Brothers, guitar master Warren Haynes. Very reminiscent of another Allman/Haynes collaboration, \\"The high cost of low living\\"(from the Brothers' 2003 \\"Hittin' the note\\"), the song seems to address the same protagonist as the earlier track. On \\"High cost\\", Gregg admonishes \\"using up all your good friends\\" and on \\"Rider\\", you can almost see him shake his head  as he sighs \\"seems like a long time- since you had any peace of mind\\".          \\"I believe I'll go back home\\" is an old public domain number with Mike Compton adding mandolin to the mix, while Magic Sam's \\"My love is your love\\"is enhanced by the beautiful female chorus arranged by Bill Maxwell. The closing traditional, \\"Rolling Stone\\" is one of the many highlights, again featuring Colin Linden's Dobro in a soft acoustic jam.            This fine recording belongs to T-bone as much as it does to Gregg. Production is excellent and choice of musicians couldn't be better. Gregg set out to make a recording he could be proud of. With \\"Low country blues\\", he just may have made the album of his life.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|I have all of Joe's albums and I have enjoyed this one so much that I have my friends listening to it.  I like how all the musicians had a part in this cd.  I get the feeling that they were all well into the sound of this one.  The recording is good too.  The bass is much cleaner than some of the other recent cd's.  Thanks JOE!!  Black Swans just rocks!
030746363X|5.0|I've read many approaches to exercise and nutrition and I've failed and every one.  This isn't necessarily because of the approach or even the author but more personal.    I'm not sure what it is about Tim's book but reading it is like talking to myself.  The approach, theory and motivation seems to ooze out of the book.  Also, the fact that it feels like he's talking to me is just crazy.    I'm only on day 2 of the 30 day slow-carb but the motivation level is just above and beyond anything I've tried in the past.  I actually look forward to eating and the next day!!    So stop reading this review and just get the damn book!!
B00479SVBU|5.0|I purchased the Soundfly MP3 player to play music I had saved on flash drives in my car.  The price was right and I just expected to have decent sound; what I got was just astounding.  First it arrived earlier than expected, so plus one the company ships promptly.  Second it was extremely easy to install, just plug in the power jacks in my car.  Third it comes with the attaching cord to plud directly into the MP3 port on my car radio or I can use a blank radio station, both work great.  Personally I like the radio use since the name of the piece I'm playing apppears on my radio.  More information is displayed on the units screen, but where my power jack is makes it difficult to safely read the screen.  The fouth surprise is the remote control and the features it controls.<br /><br />The biggest thrill I had was the sound.  I'm a classical music nut and have allot of symphonic music stored on flashdrives.  I was amazed at how detatiled and clear the sound is.  I can navigate between files and tracks, fast forward and back and bookmark a spot when I leave the car and even disconnect the unit and when I come back it will pick up right where I left off.<br /><br />If you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars this is the perfect unit.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  If you're cinsidering an MP3 for your car buy this one you won't be disappointed.

B003JTHESA|5.0|I have to admit , this album is not one of the best Maiden's albums. A Matter of Life and Death is way better and got much better guitar riffs and solos. But just for being Maiden, I give them 5 stars on the album. This legendary band deserves that much just for being the pioneers of metal scene for over 3 decades. For those people that think that this band deserves less than 4 stars, than there is no need in saying anything at all. UP THE IRONS!!!!!!
1907016414|5.0|Having read A Girl's Adventure, I was thrilled to see a new Chloe Thurlow book and, I must say, it did not disappoint. This is the story of a bored young woman who swims out to a deserted rock off the Canary Islands in Spain, where she is captured by people smugglers and taken by ship south along the African coast, and eventually across the desert to the slave market in Timbuktu. On the way, a young Sheikh who uses her for his own sexual gratification finds after she's sold to slavers that he's in love with her and gives chase to find her.     As with the first Chloe book I read, Trade Girl has amazing descriptions of - well, sex in all its shapes and colours, but you are drawn in by the power of the story. In fact, the descriptions of Africa, especially the desert, are just as sensuous as the story of the heroine's discovery of pleasure through subservience. If her lover can find her in the Dark Heart of Africa, she knows she can be the perfect concubine. Great stuff, well worth the read.
1594202842|4.0|I read Chua's book in a day.  I live in a highly populated, competive Asian school district in Orange County, and our school often comes in 1st place.  But at what cost?  The robot child that can memorize or have to do 20 pages of pre-testing a night in math as Chua's daughter Lulu did, because second best was not good enough?  Where is the critical thinking?     We live in a play free community, where beautiful parks go empty in the afternoon in favor of all the study time.  Children break down at school when they receive a less than stellar grade, because of what their parent will do to them when they get home.  If Ms. Chua wrote the same book as an American mom, she would have most likely been brought up on charges.  She was abusive, without regret.   What did Lulu actually learn?  Not much.  She became an angry rebellious and explosive teen.  Ms. Chua criticizes the western parents who put the same effort into sports.  But why?  It is the same.  The drive may be \\"best\\" for the child, but who receives the accolades?  The parent.  The showoff.  Ms. Chua in her constant need to show off her prodigy.      Her complaints about what she had to do or sacrifice at work,  to pull her child out of school for extra practice.  The frustration shown even by her parents when Ms. Chua could not even vacation without commanding her young daughters to practice.   Sadly, she states the worst offense of a chinese child is to participate in drama,and yet Ms. Chua's own husband was a drama student at Juilliard following his undergraduate degree at Princeton.  He was asked to leave Juilliard for insubordination, and continued on to Harvard Law School. Chua of course states this as a much better choice.  But come on! Don't discount the fact, the man went to Juilliard!   Imagine the difference if drama queen Lulu were able to participate in theatre arts, and have her dad as her parenting mentor?  I am sure we would have seen a different outcome.    The saddest parts of the book are when the dad points out to Chua that she has gone too far with her words.    Ms. Chau set out to show the reader why Chinese mothers are better.  I walked away glad to be just a plain ole' American mom with high achieving, happy children.
190776111X|5.0|I was given this book by a friend - a girlfriend - as a birthday present. I'd never read any erotic fiction before and have to say it's pretty steamy stuff - at first, I was a bit shocked, but then the story draws you in and I started to see that there's a whole world out there to explore - in a literary sense, unless my luck changes.     The story is about Greta May, a failed actress who meets a `dark' stranger who draws her into his bizarre world of discipline and erotic pleasure. As Greta learns more about her own true nature she seizes the illusive prize: to play the role that will put her in the spotlight. What I liked was that this is a real story and we really feel for Greta as she goes through the erotic hoops that lead finally to her achieving her dream.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|Risk has been getting a bad rap ever since it was released. A lot of people didn't like the new sounds, which sounds more like a mix of industrial rock and techno rather than the original thrash metal sound. Critical reception is still mixed even to this day. I will admit that this is not Megadeth's best, but it's not as awful as many people say. I'd give Risk 8.2 out of 10 because there are still some very good songs on this album. \\"Insomnia,\\" \\"Crush 'Em,\\" and \\"I'll Be There\\" are several examples of Megadeth's new sounds. They may not be as satisfying as, say, \\"Addicted to Chaos\\" or \\"Hangar 18,\\" but they still pack a punch. \\"Breadline,\\" one of the softer songs, has a very pop-like sound, and it would most definitely put off the band's most diehard fans. I, personally, think it's decent, but I wouldn't call it a great song.<br /><br />Risk is, in short, underrated. I find nothing wrong with Megadeth trying out new sounds. I wouldn't want all of their albums to sound like Peace Sells....But Who's Buying; it would be very repetitive if they kept their original sound through the years. Risk isn't one of their best, but it's not really their worst, either. It has some good songs, and it doesn't really deserve to be somewhere at the bottom.<br /><br />Grade: 8.2/10<br /><br />Also available from Megadeth:<br />Rust in Peace (9.3/10) [[ASIN:B0002EXH5O Rust in Peace]]<br />Countdown to Extinction (9.4/10) [[ASIN:B0002EXH4K Countdown to Extinction]]<br />Youthanasia (9.9/10) [[ASIN:B0002EXH40 Youthanasia]]<br />Cryptic Writings (9.4/10) [[ASIN:B0002EXH4U Cryptic Writings]]<br />The World Needs a Hero (8.9/10) [[ASIN:B00005EBQE World Needs a Hero]]

B001ECE6C6|5.0|There is real magic on this album. Highly recommended. I am not a huge fan of Metheny's work, but this is within shouting distance of as good as it gets. I will certainly be picking up more of Jopek's work.  There is simply nothing not to like. I saw a negative comment about the quality of the master, but I have no complaints.
B00433QE3M|1.0|I purchased several songs, those most highly recommended in the reviews here, in hope. I am a long long time fan of Carlos, from Caravanserai to Shaman. But, these are among the worst things I will have ever bought on Amazon. Uninspired, warmed over milquetoast versions of great classics. I feel like I've just been listening to, say, kristen stewart covering black magic woman, sold out by someone who phoned it in. Boo! Santana. What did metatron say about this? Rubbish! I suspect.
B002ZG994U|5.0|I think this is a great movie. I never saw much of the original TV Show but the acting is great and Liam Neeson is awesome. Definitely worth owning!
B003HARV3Y|2.0|Here's my take: if you've read the book, you'll probably be very let down by this film. It's not terrible, but so much has been changed, it's virtually unrecognizable. It's one thing to drop secondary characters and scenes that don't affect the outcome of the story; that happens in almost all adaptations. It's quite another to change main characters' personalities (in some cases, drastically), eliminate secondary characters that play a major part in this AND subsequent books, add characters that had no part in the story to begin with, and alter plot, motivation, and oh yeah, THE MAIN VILLAIN. You know you're off to a bad start when the title character's age has been upped almost five years, which flies in the face of the narrative thread that runs through the entire series! (Namely, the Prophecy involving Percy when he reaches 16). One can only deduce that this was made with little regard for fans of the book, which makes little sense, since those are the ones who were looking forward to it the most and most likely to see it in theatres.   The actors try, and Logan Lerman is an appealing Percy, but all are let down by a truly lame script that casts them adrift in cliche and tedium. If you haven't read the books, you're far more likely to enjoy this, but you may leave wondering what all the excitement was about.
B001UV4XWY|5.0|When I first saw this film some time back, Langella with his gift shaped box, presented a definite Faustian visage, and I was hooked. I kept it on my wish list for a long time, but for one reason and another, I did not get it until recently. The Ancient, yet timeless proposition that bites at humanities essence is presented in this film in a chilling , systematic, slightly supernatural, but wholely other-worldly way. For all the foibles that we see in the couple , played by Marsden and Diaz, they have some very simple questions to answer; for them, what they see is the small picture, and yet, through the course of the film, the utter terror that we discover in Arlington ( Langella), and his many \\"employees\\" is what might be part of the \\"big picture\\". And the big picture is, maybe, similar to   Lot asking God what would God do if he finds but 10 good people? Well, Arlington is not God, And Arlington is not employed by God; this is a cold, factual examination, and maybe that is why it is so chilling? Or Maybe it is because we don't know who works for Arlington, and we don't know who has come back from the dead. Trade some time to examine your own motives, you might not like what you see.
B0019Y67V2|5.0|Back when artists weren't always following strict formulas to craft albums filled with similar sounding songs, records often had a few songs you didn't like, but you bought them for the ones you did like.  This album had a whole series of hits that I've liked since my mother bought it for me when I was 2.  I played it for 7 years, during 5 of which it was warped and during 1 of which it was cracked.  Try playing a cracked CD without a problem.  I just recieved a copy of the original on vinyl and it sounds as good as it ever did.  It would be hard to find an American who was alive in the 1980's and didn't know at least one of her great songs.

B0034G4P7G|5.0|There are too many reviews of this fine film achievement, but I wanted to get my 5-stars recorded. Back-stabbing behavior is prevalent in many films, and some of the finest, like Network ('76) and Amadeus ('84), are only 2 examples that come to mind. The rapid-fire script, directed by Fincher with a cast of our best young actors, is an example of an old story meant to apply to modern sensibilities. The screenplay also allows some room for consideration that Zuckerberg had a few ideas of his own, elaborated on some inspirations, and ran with it. As a film, I found it immensely entertaining. A fine film; Recommended highly.

The action is fast-paced, funny, violent and meticulously scripted. The plots are wonderful and well thought out. The British actors are exceptional, particularly Jason Statham and the actor who portrays BrickTop. Dennis Farina has a hilarious role in this as well. All in all, this couldn't be any better.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|Excellent series to own however this set does not store the disc's well because the plastic pieces break easily....recommend that if you purchase this version that you be prepared to find a better storage method for the disc's.....this set looks good but does not store the disc's well at all. The 7 box set(one box per season) is far superior for storage but cost wise it cost's much more to get the complete series that way and no matter which way you purchase you get the same thing. I give the series 5 stars its the poor quality of this set that gets 3 stars
B002ONC9NC|4.0|The actors in this film were really phenomenal. I'm very impressed with Peter Sarsgaard's ability to be almost, almost very likeable, but with the barest hint of sleaziness that lets the audience know that something's not quite right. Carey Mulligan portrays the excitements, frustrations, and vulnerabilities of being 16 and 17 very accurately; watching the movie, I kept sitting there thinking, \\"Yeah, I've totally been there.\\" The sexual scenes were so perfectly awkward, exactly the way they would be in real life.    In terms of acting and actual movie production, I can't find much to complain about. But I think the plot fell a bit short. Sarsgaard's character leaves so abruptly for all the development his personality is given, and we get only a taste of his personal life. Mulligan's character goes from jilted and hopeless to recovered and successful over the course of a one minute montage, which seems a little too canned for this movie. In general, after the film's climax, the ending came too quickly and left me feeling let down, wanting to know more about David, and what becomes of Graham, and how Jenny picks herself up again, and with more of a taste of her new life at Oxford, rather than just a shot of her riding off into the distance on a bicycle.    But all-in-all, it's a good movie that takes a very honest approach to coming of age. I'd recommend it.
0312600844|1.0|After all the hype about this book, I was really excited to read it.  However, I was sorely disappointed.  The writing is horrible...boring, long, verbose.  This book might have been better if it was much shorter.  I liked the beginning of the book and the characters and the story, but not the middle and end.  It should have been a lot shorter.  Very disappointed.  I usually am sad to finish a book, but I am relieved to have finished this one.
6305537321|4.0|I watched \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" the other evening as part of my build-up to reading Sam Wasson's [[ASIN:0061774154 Fifth Avenue, 5 A.M.: Audrey Hepburn, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and the Dawn of the Modern Woman]].  As a first step, I read Truman Capote's original novella, originally published in 1958.  [About Capote's work: it surprises with its freshness at its 50+ year mark...and makes the reader realize what a sad waste of talent Capote became in the second-half of his life.]<br /><br />Second step: watch the movie directed by the great Blake Edwards.  Hopefully the Centennial Collection edition of the DVD has solved the sound problem.  The 'regular' release suffers from a muddled sound quality, especially the (literally) breathless stream-of-consciousness coming from Audrey Hepburn's lips. The otherwise enjoyable adaptation comes to a screeching, nails-on-a-blackboard halt whenever Mickey Rooney appears as Mr. Yunioshi.  It's a deplorable characterization, surely as offensive then as it is today.<br /><br />George Axelrod's screenplay makes major changes from Capote's work: the setting is then modern-day NYC (1961) rather than Capote's WWII time period; the narrator has a name (Paul Varjak vs. simply the 'Fred' Holly bestows upon him in Capote's work); Fred seems to have, ahem, switched teams; and the ending is dramatically altered (let's just say that Capote's version doesn't tie-up nicely into a happily-ever-after Hollywood bow).<br /><br />Furthermore, Edwards' version of the tale is even more oblique than Capote regarding Holly Golightly's, shall we say, 'source of income.'  There are indelicate men ('rats') hanging around, wild parties in her apartment, visits to Tiffany's at 5 AM in an evening dress, and references to $50 payments from men in the powder room.  Spying the money left on Fred's table by Patricia O'Neal, Holly slyly notes that there's not too much difference between the two of them.  The obliqueness is part of the movie's - and Holly's - intrigue.  Today, all that would be communicated in a far more direct - and probably less interesting - manner.t would be communicated in a far more direct - and probably less interesting - manner.
B001VL536I|5.0|I didn't think I'd ever say this, but I think Lois is becoming my favorite character on the show...and that's saying a lot cuz I love Clark Kent and the way Tom Welling portrays him.  It must be the magic between the 2 characters and the 2 actors that leads me to say...Lois rocks. I just wish they had shown more episodes of these 2 as a couple. I am a bit sad that we won't get more of episodes like Infamous anymore now that the series is ending. I love the strength of Lois and the vulnerability as well.  It makes her more human and the perfect person for Clark Kent. Strength and vulnerability...yeah...that's what I enjoy seeing in a real hero.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Return to Oz(1985) is an underrated family movie. When it came out in 1985, the film was criticized for being \\"too dark, scary, and downbeat\\"! I first saw it on syndicated television in 1988. Time has been kind to Return to Oz. Director Walter Murch and company did put some effort into the movie. Back in Kansas in 1900, Dorothy Gale(a young Fairuza Balk) is suffering from depression. Aunt Em puts her in a clinic to get electro-shock therapy! A blonde girl helps Dorothy escape and she's transported back to the Land of Oz. The Emerald City has fallen into ruin and the Tin Man and Cowardly Lion have turned to stone! Oz has been conquered by the Nome King and Princess Mombi. With new friends Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, and the Gump, Dorothy must save the Land of Oz.    Piper Laurie and Nicol Williamson are quite good in Return to Oz. David Shire's music score is superb, too. Watching Return to Oz on DVD was a nostalgic treat. It reminded me of watching it on TV on that warm, spring afternoon of 1988 with my brothers and sisters. Someone once said that home video is an afterlife for cinema. Return to Oz deserves to be watched again in that \\"afterlife\\".
B001JQR9MQ|4.0|I love the scene where Jimmy figures out that Clark is the red/blue blur.  Every time I see this epi, I want Clark and Chloe to tell him he's right. Even though I know what happens, I still want it to happen. I think this is also first time Lois calls Clark on the phone for help...which is good indicator that she already sees him in a different way. He's been her protector for longer than we give him credit. He's been doing it since the day they met but we don't think about him in that way because Lana was always in the picture.  In reality, he's been protecting Lois since day 1 and she is finally accepting that.  Finally, how creepy is Chloe at the end?
1594202842|5.0|It is time for all of us to first read a book before making judgement based on critics from the WSJ or the NYT.   Ms Chua is making some very sound comments on education. If we took some of the determination expressed in her book maybe US students might be able to rank higher on International testing. Our students suffer from over exposure to too much technology and outside interests. Alaa! the day still only has 24hours and students need to rearrange their priorities with help from educators and parents. Excellence can be reached with patience and hard work. Why is it that so many young musicians nowadays are by large of Asian background. Because they practise every day.  Everybody should read this book we all might learn something.
B001L5LWT6|3.0|I tend to skip over this episode because the story revolved totally around Chloe.   Despite this, I do have to say that the scene in Clark's fortress is an emotional one for me.  For Clark to give up his best friend's memories to protect her...well...perhaps a bit misguided but certainly a sacrificing act...his best friend won't know who he really is.  This is probably my favorite scene of the episode.
B00456PKG4|2.0|What was once a great video game has been turned into a big money special effect movie.  Unfortunately the movie falls flat and gets boring fast. I'm into action movies, but it's got to have a good story too, which this does not.
B000YENUI6|4.0|This is an excellent film, however the violence in parts of the film was a bit much to endure. I felt that the film had a carefully unfolding so that the viewer was never certain of anything except the moral character of the nurse played by Naomi Watts. Now this is a nice plot devise to have one character on whom the viewer can trust to make ethical decisions and thus it allows you to suspend judgment about all the other characters and try to sort out the puzzle pieces one by one as they are revealed.  Violence is not implied in the film, it is usually shown in full gore. Likewise the plot is not always obvious and the film pulls a couple of surprises on you. The film depicts the Russian underground crime families living in London, a group hardened by the Soviet Union realities and the hardships they endured in Russia. The acting is superb and I was glad to see that Vincent Cassel was included in the top billing with Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts since he had a very difficult role to play which he delivers with great power. Mortensen does a super job in this film for he plays a driver for a Russian mob family who gradually is involved in more violence and is allowed into the inner sanctum by Kyril, the mixed-up son of the Russian godfather.  The nude steam bath fight scene is as terrible as anything I have seen in a film in a long time but it was highly realistic and amazingly filmed, though I have to admit I looked away a couple of times because it was intense. Armin Mueller-Stahl is the actor who plays the elderly Russian godfather of the underworld family. He seems like a grandfather but his dark side is gradually revealed and Mueller-Stahl plays it wonderfully for he remains understated from start to finish.  The plot is carefully filmed so that the viewer is shown details, clues, and character flaws one at a time until a picture of what is actually going on begins to reveal it. The ending is not sentimental at all and whereas it resolves in the minds of the viewer what happens in the future, it is not necessarily a happy future for all. I would recommend this to folks who can deal with a complex plot and a good deal of violence.
0393072231|5.0|I could be biased in evaluating anything that Michael Lewis writes, because I truly believe that he is the best contemporary writer out there. I was amazed by the fluidity of his narrative when I first read \\"Liar's Poker\\" ten years ago, and he continues to impress with \\"The Big Short\\". I am sure that anybody can agree that he's entertaining, and can make the most boring financial jargon bearable by us simpletons. Also, this book reflects and narrates better than anyone else the chain of events that lead to the stock market crash in 2008.<br /><br />I would like to point out that \\"The big short\\" is not about the small group of colorful characters that Michael Lewis follows through their journey of CDS riches. The stories of the people who bet against the subprime mess are entertaining nevertheless, but what's fascinating is the story of who was holding (creating the market) the other end of these bets, the house. The house was corrupt starting from the unscrupulous NINJA loans institutions, to the bond geeks creating the Collateralized Debt Obligation derivatives who nobody could understand, to the bond rating agencies (Moody's and S&P), lack of internal auditing, lack of regulatory oversight, combined with executives turning a blind eye towards these unrealistic earnings they were making.<br /><br />The factors that lead to the recession we are still experiencing today are all in this book. It's a slightly different angle than \\"Too Big To Fail\\", but far easier to read and weep. I also like how Michael Lewis doesn't place a lot of blame on the naivet&eacute; of the people taking the loans. The immigrant cherry-picker in Southern California with a 750k mortgage was not to blame. Neither was the Vegas stripper with five mortgages on five houses. They did it because they could. While I am a conservative to the bone, I agree with Michael Lewis to not blame the NINJAs for taking on these loans.<br /><br />The real criminal behavior is attributed to the list that I mentioned above. This was the biggest get-rich-quick scheme of modern finance,  and Michael Lewis has hit the nail in the head.<br /><br />This book would make a perfect read for anybody, but it should be especially examined by Wall Street traders, rating agencies pencil pushers, government bureaucrats, and anyone interested in finance and economics.t get-rich-quick scheme of modern finance,  and Michael Lewis has hit the nail in the head.

0385333846|4.0|Overall this isn't a bad book; however I think its geared towards the generation of the 1960s and 1970s (I'm 30).  This book is touted as an antiwar book - I just didn't see that in reading it.  The style and the story is easy to read and I like how certain events are linked to each other; such as Billy Pilgrim hiding under a hospital bed cover only to awaken in a makeshift hospital room in Germany.  I also found the use the phrase \\"So it goes\\" after the mention of someone's death an interesting literary device.  My major negative point is that I don't feel any attachment to Billy Pilgrim, he's a character I really couldn't grow to have any concern for or feel any emotional connection to...then again, this might have been by design.

0321543726|5.0|After a few months of playing with Arduino and some other micro-controllers, I thought it might be helpful to take a serious stab at learning C++. Moreover, I wanted a text that not only \\"covered\\" C++, but did so with an overarching goal of teaching the principles and practices of good computer programming. I am not disappointed with Dr. Stroustrup's book.<br /><br />Now I am not claiming that this is an \\"easy\\" book, but it absolutely does the job of teaching a novice the language of C++. I began this effort with very little computer knowledge beyond that of an experienced PC user. I struggled to get the basic \\"hello_world\\" program to work, and initially felt overwhelmed in trying to learn my way around the Visual C++ IDE, but no more so than I struggled to figure out what to do at a C:\ when I first touched a computer 20 years ago.<br /><br />This book delivers. I found that with careful reading and then some re-reading and experimenting, I was able to figure out exactly where the bugs were in my initial programs and now, several chapters into the text, I feel completely comfortable as I fill in vast holes in my knowledge.<br /><br />Dr. Stroustrup gives absolutely brilliant advice about how to learn programming and how to read and study his book. One of his best points is not to worry about not figuring it out the first time. Indeed, I did read chapters 0-2 and appendix C several times before I really understood how to get the computer to say \\"Hello World\\" in C++, but once I got past that hurdle, I find that I am flying through the text, and for that matter, the initial climb would not have been nearly as steep had I been able to follow his advice to obtain some coaching from an experienced programmer.<br /><br />Dr. Stroustrup doesn't try to pretend that computer programming is a simple task and leave the novice feeling like a ninny for failing to \\"get it\\" the first time. Instead, he patiently explains what needs to be done. Then he gives the reader license to be a bit baffled and to go back and try it again.<br /><br />Of course the first few chapters are loaded with material that is completely new for most readers, but by Chapter 3, Dr. Stroustrup settles into a practice of briefly introducing new terms and techniques, intensely focusing on a particular new technique that has already been briefly introduced, and continuing to reinforce material taught in previous sections until it is thoroughly ingrained. I like the way he signals that he is reviewing something for the last time and henceforth will assume that the reader is already able to do a certain task without reminder. I have generally found that by the time he signals this, indeed I HAVE nailed it down.<br /><br />Hampered by the schedule of an adult with a family and a career outside of the computer field, I am moving at a slow pace... about 2 weeks per chapter. However, if I had the schedule of a college student I am quite confident that I would be able to work through most of the text in a semester, even without, but especially with the aid of a good professor.<br /><br />Beyond teaching programming, Dr. Stroustrup gives outstanding advice for students in general. He lays out a study plan for his material that would serve any student well in any field. I can only wish I had been exposed to a professor like him as a college freshman. I suspect my undergraduate, and even my graduate school years would have been much easier.<br /><br />In summary, an excellent text and a great value. I am pleased that I bought it.d try it again.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|I don't get why people are so nitpicky that George Lucas made tweaks for this Blu-Ray release. They are only minor and the soul of the movies are still definitely there. If you are going to concentrate on minor quibbles for things like \\"Vader didn't say Noooo! in the original theatrical release of Empire Strikes Back\\" then you will simply never be happy.<br /><br />Fact is, these movies are fun to watch (and hear) on Blu-Ray!  If you have a nice home theatre system, it's a must have. The experience is nothing short of amazing and this box set sets a high water mark for mastering and audio quality.<br /><br />Would I prefer that Lucas didn't go in and make minor tweaks to certain things? Yes, I would probably prefer the theatrical released versions instead.<br /><br />Do I let this hamper my enjoyment of these classic films action-packed films? Absolutely not.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I am almost finished the kindle version of this book. It is the first book that I have read on my new kindle and I must say that I am surprised at how easy it is too read. It isnt horribly hard to understand like some english novels of the time. It also isnt boring and has some mysteries at every turn of the page. It isnt at all a purely male book as I thought. This version does have some issues with editing so I give it four stars. A great free classic!

0060936223|5.0|Patti Smith writes beautifully about her intimate relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe and their dedication to art. Because it takes place in New York City (Greenwich Village area) during the late 1960s and 70s, her story also offers readers a vision of what life and the arts scene were like during that era. Included in the book are photos and drawings; it feels as if you are looking through a personal journal. Her writing flows smoothly and is well crafted -- evidence of her years as a poet. Robert would be pleased.

031603438X|5.0|I got this for Christmas from my daughter and it was a great gift.  I am surprised by the one star reviews here on Amazon.  I've read lots of musician autobiographies and biographies - especially those about jazz musicians (Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong, etc).  I must say this is one of the more entertaining I've read - far better than Miles Davis' autobiography and that book, well it was something else for sure.  A single word to describe this book is \\"honesty\\".  You get all the details, an honest confessional of sorts<br /><br />I like The Stones.  I'm not a huge Keith fan, for example you will never hear or read something I've written referring to him as \\"Keef\\" as one of his minions might.  I don't know the guy, using his nickname is silly.  In fact, after reading \\"STP (a terrible book that is full of factual errors), my opinion of this guy was mostly on the negative side until I read his book and I liked it... a lot!  I think Richards is a very interesting cat who is/was both tragic, triumphant and wise - and I like the guy, how can you not like him.  His honesty, his humor, his humanity.  You don't have to agree with him to like him.<br /><br />I like the narrative style, it's like he's having an intimate chat with you.  It is funny the way he got others to write a lot of his book, he really pulled a Tom Sawyer there I think, you know?  Whitewashing the fence sure is fun!  ha ha!<br /><br />I must say I was a bit shocked at how openly he shared the gory details of hi.s falling out with Jagger back in the 80's, that was probably the biggest surprise in the book, he really dishes it out!  Lots of anecdotes about his companions and fellow musicians.  He does actually get down into the music as well.  It isn't just about his self-abuse and debauchery.<br /><br />One disappointment is that after 500+ pages I don't think anyone else besides Keith Richards understands what \\"guitar weaving\\" is from the perspective of his playing.  Weaving what?  I've been playing for over 30 years with and without other guitarists and I don't understand his concept.  If I listen to someone like the 1980's incarnation of King Crimson I can hear \\"weaving\\" all over the place.<br /><br />On the other hand, Keith breaks down Street Fighting Man, the instrumentation and it's fascinating.  I've always wondered about how they got the sound of the guitars on this one. There is not a single electric instrument used on that track!  The drums come from a little portable practice kit that fold out of a suitcase.<br /><br />I liked the book a lot, I was a page turner.  Now I feel that I better know the guy, he's a family man and a committed artist.  I still won't call him \\"Keef\\" though.  5 star reading for sure!<br /><br />After some further thinking about this book there are some things that bothered me about Keith's book.<br /><br />1.  Richards' is a  revisionist as far as the history of the Stones goes.  He does not give Jones the props he deserves for founding The Rolling Stones.  It's all Stu Stu Stu.  Fine, Stu was there and a partner of sorts to Jones but you can't deny the guy's place in music history just because you didn't like him. You read ANY other account of what happened when The Stones were formed and Jones gets the nod as the driver.<br /><br />2.  Richards doesn't even mention Peter Tosh... How can that be?  Really, not even a nod to this incredible man whom the Stones helped make a star by signing him the very first record deal on Rolling Stones Records.  The very first star to sign?  I fail to understand this.  It's a GLARING omission.  One begins to sense that when Richards decides he doesn't like someone he either withholds any acknowledgement or revises history.<br /><br />3.  His put down of Bob Marley really wasn't necessary.  I love Keith's music but he doesn't even approach the genius and spirit of Marley in my opinion.<br /><br />4.  He fails to accept any accountability for what happened at Altamont.<br /><br />5.  There's a bit of machismo in a few places that borders on silly really.  You're gonna cut my throat Keith for dissing one of your friends?  Come on man, it's goofy.<br /><br />I still loved the book and thought it was entertaining and a great read but it does have these problems.You're gonna cut my throat Keith for dissing one of your friends?

B001FB55L2|5.0|Brothers is an emotional, realistic motion picture that tells the story of what can happen when someone is missing in action during wartime and presumed dead--and then returns back home to everyone's amazement. The casting was superb and the script, musical score and editing were all very well done; this is a gripping drama that had my eyes glued to the screen to find out more as the plot progressed and then to see what came of all of it. Another reviewer writes that this \\"is as real as it gets;\\" and indeed it was all so believably done I felt as if I were there!<br /><br />When the action starts, we meet Marine Captain Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire); he goes to get his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) out of prison; Tommy will now be on parole for a bank robbery. Sam also gets ready to leave his family to return to Afghanistan for yet another tour of duty, much to the chagrin of Sam's wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and his daughters Isabelle (Bailee Madison) and Maggie (Taylor Geare).<br /><br />It isn't long, though, before Sam and some of his men are shot down during a helicopter mission; and Sam along with his Marine buddy Joe Willis (Patrick John Flueger) are held by the Taliban as hostages. Because they cannot be found and the crash was very bad, the military tells Grace that her husband Sam has been killed in combat; and the entire family, including Tommy, begins a painful mourning experience. This includes many snide put-downs Tommy must endure from his father Hank (Sam Shepard).<br /><br />Things gets more complicated when Tommy innocently tries to console Grace and the young girls; he goes to great lengths to put some happiness back into their lives--in fact, Tommy and his buddies even build a new kitchen for Grace!  Grace and the other family members start to rebuild their lives--and that's just when Grace gets a phone call that Sam is actually still alive and is returning home quite soon.<br /><br />But Sam has changed very much because of the incredible psychological trauma he experienced at the hands of his captors. He has had to do something nearly unspeakable in order to be released from them; and Sam can't even tell them what he had to do. Sam is also possessed with the false notion that Tommy and Grace have started an intense romance in his absence when all they did was share a very brief and awkward kiss--just once.<br /><br />The rest of the plot is for you to learn as you watch the film. Suffice it to say that Sam's scars are profoundly deep (he has post-traumatic stress disorder) and he refuses to believe that Tommy and Grace have been just very good friends.<br /><br />There is some violence and a few four letter words in this movie; it's not for young children but adults may like this movie very much.<br /><br />The DVD comes with a few extras including an optional running audio commentary with director Jim Sheridan; a featurette entitled \\"Remade in the USA: How Brødre Became Brothers\\" and \\"Jim Sheridan: Film and Family.\\"<br /><br />Brothers impressed me; the cast does a wonderful job and that's grand.

B0034G4OY0|1.0|This was hands down the most pointless, boring movie I have ever seen. I went to see this film simply because Clint Eastwood has been making very good movies lately. I figured that this film would more of the same of his work.     This movie was slow, boring, and lacked substance. It made you believe that within the next scene or the scene after that, something would happen to make the movie interesting. This film was so poorly done that I decided to wait for friends in the lobby of the theater instead of enduring any more of this film.     Do yourself a favor, do not watch this film. You will waste money and more importantly, time.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|I found it very interesting and thought provoking - but that would be a normal response.  The time of the script to the end of the filming must have a been a masive nerve trip - of course that is the way that it should have been.  The WW1.  The insight was erie.  Like most films today the artwork for the posters would be something that catches the film goers eye regardless of how much time that this scene is captured on film.  I do not believe that a picture with sound could have captured as much provication as the silent one has remarkably done.

0321525655|3.0|I don't know much about Zen or Japanese culture, but after reading this book I do now!  Unfortunately, along the way I didn't learn nearly enough about presentations and how to avoid \\"death by PowerPoint.\\"    In order to stand out on the virtual shelf, Presentation Zen uses Zen philosophy as a teaching method.  Personally, I found this distracting and superfluous.  Ironic, since one of the book's key philosophies is to keep your presentation basic with the \\"less is more\\" concept.  See, I guess I did learn something from the book.    The book was an enjoyable read with a view of an entirely different culture than the one I grew up in and, occasionally, I did learn a few key points about presentations.  Because of the narrative nature of this book, extracting advice for giving presentations was difficult to discern. Typically in technical books, the authors teach key points with use of the main text and then put miscellaneous extras on the side.  In this book, the technical points were on the side and philosophies, interviews, and cultural icons appeared to be the main focus.  Overall, the book dealt with the nuances of presentation rather than a direct guide on how to prevent your audience (and you) from falling asleep when the lights go down and your presentation begins.     I do recommend the book as a starting point in your journey to create better presentations.  Instead of giving specific tips and instruction, overall ideas and concepts are presented in this very quick read.  In particular, presentations should be about the presenter and not about the slides on the screen.  The slides should supplement and amplify what the speaker is saying, rather than the speaker being the spokesperson for the slides on the screen.    Pros:  Nice window to Japanese culture and Zen philosophy with application to presentations  Cons:  Lack of firm structure and clear instructions on presentations    3 out of 5
1599218011|5.0|I've been thinking of dabbling in \\"veganism\\" for awhile now.  I have lots of great cookbooks and I fully understand where the hard core vegans are coming from...  but I'm a little scared of giving up CHEESE (most of all) and the convenience of meat, etc.  After reading through Kris Carr's book, which is so smart and classy and motivating, I'm ready to jump in and give it a try.  My favorite quote from the book is this, \\"Do the best you can and if you stumble, don't marinate in guilt.  Get back on the wagon and start anew.  Life is too sweet to be bitter, so JUST DO YOUR BEST.\\"  What an amazing attitude.  It is found throughout the book... along with funny lines and stories and also awesome nutritional information that is backed up with studies.  It is going to be a process.... and I feel like that is okay.  The book is also BEAUTIFUL and just plain fun to read.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Not that mythology in general hasn't always been of interest, but as an elementary school librarian, I've seen students as young as second and third grade wanting not only to read the Riordan series, but also to read anything else I have on mythology in the library, even in the reference section! Riordan does for mythology what Rowling's Harry Potter series has done with magic. The writing is sound, the characters true to form with wonderful voices, the action full of surprising twists, and the sound of audible sighs when the last word has been read in anticipation of the next book. Bravo Rick Riordan!

It isn't an easy read throughout, but some parts are entertaining and even funny. I just finished reading  \\"The Dirty Life\\" by Kristin Kimball, which brings the topics in Pollen's book to the personal level.  Both books are worthy of your attention if you hace interest in how your food comes to you.

1594202842|5.0|I agree with Carol's review (# 122): Most of the reviews I have read have not picked up on the important theme of \\"Chinese Parenting Is an Inherently Closet Practice,\\" which runs throughout Amy's book.  As an immigrant myself, I know only too well how different immigrant cultures, speaking different languages at home, are forced to hide their thoughts and opinions from the outside.  I would also agree that cultural-linguistic expressions found in other cultures would be automatically labeled \\"abusive\\" or politically incorrect. It is precisely for this reason that most Asians or other immigrants have not DARED to \\"come out\\" with the truth.  They fear it will only feed into already existing negative cultural stereotypes.  They are forced to only \\"criticize\\" a culture, using the DOMINANT Western framework for criticizing. But by being forced to adopt only the dominant western lens to criticize their own culture, they have not been allowed to explain, or \\"voice,\\" their own culture in the first place.      Amy Chua's book breaks out of that cultural straightjacket of preexisting norms and stereotypes. She dares to take on all those stereotypes, and forces the reader to better understand that what might sound \\"abusive\\" to one culture, may have a completely different meaning in another culture. When a Chinese mother (or other immigrant, for that matter) says to their kids \\"You are garbage\\", might not that also signify: \\"You know we love you and believe you can do better;\\"  \\"the prevailing standards surrounding you might say that is acceptable, but you should not shoot for mediocrity\\"; \\"If you adopt the prevailing norms, you are lowering yourself and your true self-worth - and that is garbage in our eyes.\\" I have many friends who, after reading Chua's book, started crying.  \\"Yes,\\" they said - \\"those words of LOVE and EMPOWERMENT are exactly what I took away from my immigrant parents' upbringing, and yet until now, we dared not go public. To Americans, those words sound inherently \\"abusive.\\"      Another important theme of Chua's book - on GENERATIONAL DECLINE - has also been completely missed by the readers and reviewers. One book review even deliberately took quotes from Chua's book out of context, and made it sound like she was only obsessed with her own family's success. In fact, Chua voices the concern that many first and second generation immigrants have - that once the family becomes more economically prosperous, lazy habits take over. She quotes a famous Chinese saying:  \\"Prosperity can never last more than three generations\\".  There are obvious parallels throughout history and the world - with the rise and fall of civilizations and empires.      Chinese American children growing up in the U.S. are told repeatedly by their schools, teachers, counselors, and friends' parents that the Chinese parent is \\"abusive.\\"  They bear the biggest psychological burden, growing up in a society where the prevailing Western norm leaves no room for a genuine understanding of the immigrant culture.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I picked up Room: A Novel for my Kindle because Amazon was touting it as #1 Bestseller for Kindle. I can see why. As a writer, I was floored by the pure technique required to sustain the point of view of the five year old protagonist through the whole story. As a reader, I was awestruck at the way that story was revealed. That may sound like hyperbole, but in this case, I feel it is justified.    Jack has lived his entire life in Room. Door only opens to let in \\"Old Nick\\", and he only comes at night. Jack and Ma watch TV, and do Track by moving Rug onto Bed. They count the cereal and care for Plant. It is a confined existence, but all he's ever known. Until the day Ma starts \\"Unlying\\" and the world becomes a completely different place.    I recommended it to a friend, and on reading the description, he said it sounded \\"delightfully disturbing.\\" It is. Compelling, disturbing, \\"scave\\" (you'll know what I mean when you read it) and wonderful. This is definitely a keeper to me. Highest recommendations.
014241543X|4.0|This book should be considered a novella, I read it in one sitting. If I Stay is a short look at the traumatic experience of a family car accident where all members are lost except Mia. Mia who is close to her immediate family, friends, and boyfriend has an out of body experience where she sees herself being loaded first into the ambulance and then later into the medivac, and treated at the hospital. At first she is unclear if she is alive or dead, but soon realizes she is not a ghost but rather unconscious and can see herself and those around her working to keep her alive. Mia must decide if she wants to live or die, and she retells her life story and readers watch as it flashes before her eyes. Mia must ask herself \\"If I stay\\" what will happen and what will it be like without my family? Is it worth it? Can I do it?<br /><br />The traumatic retelling of the car accident, emergency surgery, and ICU is graphic and disturbing, but even more emotional for anyone who has experienced it or had a close family member or friend involved in some accident with similar procedures and outcomes. I found flashbacks and emotions of my own being re-played in my head as I relived my own experiences in the waiting room of hospitals. This connected me deeply to both the main character Mia as well as her family and friends.<br /><br />Forman's description of Mia's life and growing up is juvenile and sometimes annoying, as if a middle-schooler rather than a graduating senior is speaking. Mia also loses focus as she switches back and forth from present traumatic happenings to life as it once was. Both of these critiques can understandingly be justified however. First the book is YA, so naturally it is written on a simplistic level. Secondly, Forman is using the flashbacks to build suspense and stall the reader from identifying the surprise ending. Regardless, I was able to connect quickly to the character, not just based on similar traumatic experiences, but because of her love for the cello and classical music. This theme of music is woven throughout the novella and ties people, places, and things together. The book is about life decisions and even the ultimate decision of whether to live at all, but it all plays out in front of the backdrop of music.  It is not the most uplifting of books, but it is touching, short, and sweet.<br /><br />This is also suppose to be coming out as a movie soon.al music.

0307408833|3.0|My quick assessment:  lovely book with great ideas...but it's for those with either deep pockets or deep convictions about food ingredients - both great things, I just don't happen to possess either.  I love the idea of this book (we eat GFree at our house), using extremely high quality ingredients, but there are two problem for me:  1) where do I find these ingredients  2) how do I afford these ingredients.     So, in the end, the book went back to the library after sitting on my kitchen counter for several weeks with shopping lists to buy the specific ingredients...and not a single recipe was made or the ingredients ever purchased.  I really wanted to get on board, but just didn't end up taking the leap.

0465022227|5.0|First off, let me point out that I'm reviewing the first edition of this book (1993) which I very recently bought. Had I known a second edition was coming out so soon, I would have bought that instead. Anyway, this book is basically advice for young people who are interested in a career in science. If you are planning to go to graduate school (for a Ph.D.), it will be especially of help. There are 8 easily readable chapters that take you from graduate school all the way up to establishing yourself as a reputable scientist. Given that the book is only 100 pages or so, the material is obviously succinct. There is also some useful material on preparing (and delivering) scientific presentations, and writing science papers.<br /><br />As a young scientist myself (in academia), I can relate to much of it and also learned a few things (e.g. in terms of what to expect at this point). The only issue I had with the book is this. While Feibelman's background is physics, his advice his still largely applicable to people doing research in other areas. However, his perspectives are very US-oriented. The depictions of processes and life in both academia and industry are therefore not very accurate if you look at science and scientists in other countries. In fact, taking his advice - assuming it all works the way he says they do - in *your* country, could actually be detrimental to your career. I found myself shaking my head at times, realizing that this may be how it is in the US, but it's a bit different where I'm from. Some things are better, some things are worse. Ultimately, as a scientist (whether in academia or industry), you should basically want to do the best science you can in the time you have. If your intentions are genuine and work thorough, you are more likely to be the most satisfied at the end of the day.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|To Mr. Cameron,    Having been a student of filmaking for many years now, as well as a writer of Science Fiction, I offer you two different perspectives on your collectors edition of Avatar. On one level I thought the extended version was excellent where the few added minutes helped to accentuate the film. On another level I felt you should have taken more time to release this version in order to complete and add to the overall film the 45 minutes of source fragment material that were a joy to view. You see, many of those scenes placed greater emphasis on the bond Jake Scully had made with the Naavi thereby making his leadership with their battle against the humans at the end of the story that much more credible. Heck, if I can sit and watch the 5 hour directors cut of John Woo's mighty film Red Cliff in one viewing then sitting and watching a 3 3/4 hour viewing of Avatar would be like being in heaven. Good Day!

B003L20IFQ|4.0|After waking up in a small wooden coffin, Paul Conroy (Reynolds) uses everything he has (lighter and cell phone) to find a way out.  The movie opens with no sound or picture for about 30 seconds, then the lighter flicks on and we see Conroy.  That's where the camera stays the entire time.  Except for a short cell phone video Reynolds is the only person we see in the movie.  But much like Tom Hanks in \\"Castaway\\" he is enough to carry it alone and you forget you only see him.  I know what your thinking...how good can a movie be if it only has one person in it the entire time with only a lighter and a cell phone.  The answer is simple.  Fantastic!  This movie feels so real, (the claustrophobia aspect helps) that it is the most tense I've been while watching a movie since I can't remember.  You are right there feeling his frustration and outright anger at the people he calls you want to throw something at the screen.  Not to give anything away, but the ending will leave you breathless.  That also leads to the one downside of the movie.  Like the \\"Sixth Sense\\" its not one that will have the same effect when watched a second time.  I give it an A.
1594202842|5.0|Read it in two airports as my flights were delayed.  Finished it Saturday morning.  (Needed bar time after delayed flight/12 hours in airports.)  I was engrossed, I laughed, I almost cried, I thought to myself \\"Amy, let it go!\\" and so on.  I couldn't put it down.  Loved her sense of humor.  She laid yourself out there for us.  Yeah, I even got mad at Jed a little, but I loved Amy, Jed, Sophie and Lulu and even Coco and the other puppy.  At times suspected overdramatization.  That is until I thought of my own Korean born wife (now passed) and her epic battles with my son, especially when he was a 9th grader.  They had a knock down drag out.  My wife was Confucian, influenced by her grandfather who had the audacity to teach a young Korean girl Chinese characters.  (Got to love Korea, what other country puts Confucian scholars (T'oegye and Yulgok) on their currency?)  Okay, so last Saturday I went to a wedding.  Bride is former student, and four of five bridesmaids were former students.  I passed my copy of the book on to one of the bridesmaids, young woman who is now an architect, she plays piano, duh!).  Told her jokingly that this was a `chick book' because it made me cry.  I spotted her engrossed in the book later at the reception.  Funny thing is Sunday morning, the bride (one of my best critics) talked to me for a good 20 minutes.  She wanted to know why I didn't give the book to her.  She'd read the WSJ piece on the book (I linked it to her on Facebook - yeah, I know FB is evil).  She made her hubby a white guy like me read the link.  Her mommy is Ilocano and her daddy is Jewish.  (Don't worry, I'll `gift' her a copy, plus have to get another one to keep.)  Am irritated by some of the flack author is taking and the knee jerk reactions including the review in the NYT by Kate somebody, who I seriously doubt had read the book.  So she quotes Amy (out of context, of course) and stirs up criticism.  I was bothered by that because they missed the point so totally.Three more things.  First, author didn't own up to her Legalist heritage, she is an intellectual daughter of Han Fei.  Also, why didn't she cede the point to Lulu earlier?  All Lulu was doing was updating a Confucian precept:  \\"In serving one's parents, a son (daughter) may gently (well okay that's a reach) remonstrate with them. If he (she) sees that they are not inclined to follow his (her) suggestion, he (she) should resume his reverential attitude, but not abandon his (her) purpose.\\"  Second, you are out of balance, you need a little Daoism in your life.  You need Chuang Tzu.  More than that you need Li Po (Li Bai) and you need Chinese poetry.  Why are you having your daughters do written toasts, when they ought to be writing poems in the great tradition of Li Po, Tu Fu, Wang Wei and so many others?  (I do go on, don't I?)    Too many people read this through their own provincial ('Western' or 'American') lens.  Sad, cuz they are mising a really thoughtful book.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|... he sings, but there's nothing left to prove here. This is the mother of all box sets. As I've played with this for almost two months now, I've found that I mainly go back to the Houston bootleg. I ripped the audio and must have listed to this in the car or on my stereo twenty or more times. In fact, I find the Houston version of \\"Prove it all night\\" is worth the price of the box set alone. I've heard such guitarwork lately only when Tom Morello was guesting. Other great tracks are \\"The Fever\\", and \\"Point Blank\\". Generally, I find this concert a great addition to the '75 Hammersmith gig as this one contains much of Springsteen's best work with the Darkness songs. It goes without saying that the rest of the box set is great, too. Buy it, guys!

B0007OASII|5.0|-Over the years, Kamelot has made quite a name for themselves, a title that few bands have matched. This is, in my opinion their greatest work... even better than 'Epica.' Just barely. Personally, I think that both albums are practically essential to any power metaler's collection.It makes me sad to think that this is the same band that came out with the underwellming mediocre release, 'Poetry for the Poisoned.' As we all know, this is a concept album, continuing the story loosly based on the tragedy of 'Faust.' Apart from being an amazing singer, Roy Khan is also an excellent lyricist. Khan abandons the traditional power metal lyrical themes of slaying dragons and stuff, and introduces us a more serious atmosphere... one that I much prefer. Let me begin with the actuall song-writing. Thomas Youngblood is in my opinon, one of the most underrated guitarists ever. Just watch the DVD 'One Cold Winter's Night' and you'll know what I'm talking about. Unlike the vast majority of guitarists that mindlessly shred throughout every song just for the sake of shredding, Youngblood compliments the songs with his more subtle touch. His memorable riffs and songwriting abillities leave lame bands like Dragonforce in the dust.   -This album features Shagrath from symphonic metal band Dimmu Borgir on 'March of Mophisto.' Yes, I know they claim to be Black metal, but these days, They share more charectoristics of Symphonic metal than Black metal in my opinion. But whatever. Then we have Simone Simons of Epica contributing aswell, in 'The Haunting.' Both are really cool songs, but then again, pretty much all of these tracks are great! It's quite  progressive and  Oliver Palotai's  keyboard work is masterfull, but not overdone. (Ironically Oliver is currently in a relationship with Simone... just throwing that out there;)Sean Tibett's bass playing is right on aswell, it's unusuall that a metal bassist should use only his fingers when playing (Alex Webster comes to mind.) This is even more impressive to me, considering that most just use a pick to make it easier to keep up. Again, I would highly recommend watching 'One Cold Winter's Night,' as his skills are best demonstrated here. I'm probably just covering ground that has already been tread, as this record gets alot of attention, but this is my two cents contribution. In conclsion, get it. Now.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|1) This was an awesome action packed movie that follows the games really well -- there is even a fight scene the follows the one it RE5 game shot for shot!<br />2) The 3D is perfect! I didn't experience any ghosting at all , the image was crisp and vibrant I am going to watch it again this weekend<br />3) The audio was superb<br /><br />This turned out to be my favorite RE movie yet<br /><br />If your an action or RE fan then just buy it I am sure  you will enjoy it and if you have a 3D TV you HAVE to add it to your collection now!
B000IAZPKM|5.0|-This is by far the greatest live DVD I have seen, (besides the celtic woman one that came on pbs, that was cool too.) To anybody that thought that Roy Khan was an amazing vocallist, but was worried that he may not have been able to re-create that same sound live, be without fear. Noth only can he capture that same flawless tone- he IMPROVES it! But don't worry-there's enough evidence to proove that none of this DVD was dubed over in studio. No, what we have here is raw, natural talent. The energy that went into this show was simpily phenominal! I really can't spot any flaws on it, even after repeated listens... on the conterary, it just gets better. Khan's voice, combined with his comanding stage presents really brings the show to life, but he certanitly is not the only highlight.<br />Thomas youngblood really deserves a metal for his performance here. I never paid a whole lot of attention to his playing before this. I mean, I knew he was a good player, I just underestimated his genuine talent. If I could compere him to any other guitarist, mabey it would be Nightwish's Emppu Vourien, who's subtle touch compliments the music instead of overpowering it. His solos may not be that technicall, but it suits the music. Youngblood has a similer method, just a different syle/sound. he doesent seem to invoke as much tremelo/whammy usage, and does more pinch-harmonic stuff as dimonstrated on 'March of Mophisto.' He has never been one to take the center stage, but is always there to support Khan's charisma on the side of the stage.<br />-Keyboards are great aswell. It is a common fault of many powermetaller's to allow the keyboards to get way out of hand. This guy knows how much is too much, and really adds to the music without ruining it. My peronal favorite track with him would probably be 'The Center of the Universe.' superb.<br />-The bass player really impressed me hear aswell. Just the fact that he uses his fingers as opossed to a pick is amazing, but to do so while maintaining a steady tone with no noticable mistakes is even more amazing. He stood out on 'When the Lights are Down,' imitating the guitar work with several key changes.<br />The crowd seems to really be into it, and honestly, with a performance like that... who wouldn't be? I don't care if your a kamelot fan or not, If you were there, right below the stage, you'd be going crazy.<br />-Simone is there too of coarse, complimenting Khan's voice with her own on 'the Haunting.' I like the live version better than the music video! They go together like fire and ice. Oh, and let me just say, I've seen some impressive headbanging prior to this, but... dang. Just watch the vid and you'll understand what I mean. Shagrath on the other hand was absent. That's a shame. I wanted to see him do some creepy stuff on stage. They had a replacement of corse... and he was ok,just not as evil and... for lack of better words, just not Shagarth.Then again, I thought that they should have made his vocal contributions on march of mophisto louder, you know? I wanted to here him ROAR!!! Never the less, the sound was right on with the heart-pounding 'March of mophisto.'<br />-We also get to enjoy beatifull ballads such as 'Forsaken.' That one was powerfull. Khan has proven his abillities to the world, and really gave off alot of versatility. All and all, this single disc is well worth the cash.<br />The second disc is cool too. nothing essential, but pretty cool. I won't go into too much depth, as I would prefer not to spoil anything more than I allredy have. This DVD is highly recomended for fans of Kamelot, power metal, and everyone that shares an open mind with the capabillities of appriciating good music. Go buy it, and you won't be disapoited. I SPEAKETH THE TRUTH!
1594202842|5.0|Love her or hate her, you've got to give Amy Chua credit for stirring debate.  I live in DC, and her WSJ article is the topic of conversation at the gym, work, social outings.  Of course, most of us would find her parenting extreme (and destructive on many levels), but it has caused my husband and me to realize that we could stand to be a little more \\"Chinese.\\"  While I don't think my kids need to practice piano or violin for 3 hours a day, I could introduce music, and pay closer attention to their homework (so I can encourage them not to just rush through it to get it done, but make an effort to do their best.) Plus, it's a good read - you really are drawn into the story, and it's fascinating to get a window into how other parents (and cultures) approach and see the world.

B0049OSQ18|5.0|\\"The King is Dead\\" the new and sixth album by Portland's finest \\"The Decemberists\\" sees Colin Meloy and chums return with an album of much more straightforward songs than their previous theatrical concept outing \\"The Hazards of Love\\". The consequence for this reviewer is unadulterated pleasure since while Hazards was an impressive piece of work it is the Decemberists of the \\"Picaresque\\" era which really starts the pulses racing. Having listened to this album for two weeks streaming on NPR you will find a hugely accessible and accomplished set full of crisp Americana based songs with enough hooks to catch mackerel as evidenced by the thumping opener \\"Don't carry it all\\". In the background throughout \\"TKID\\" you will also detect the influence of two master musicians namely the jangle guitar miester Peter Buck from REM and one of gods representatives on earth, Gillian Welch the great Appalachian style country singer who sings on seven of the ten tracks.<br /><br />Listen to the huge alt country ballad \\"Rise to me\\" or the gentling rolling \\"All arise\\" full of guitars, fiddle, accordion, harmonica and pedal steel to detect Welch's direct influence and it is a force for good. Not that this greater simplicity has blunted Meloy's wordy gymnastics. Anyone who can rhyme \\"enzymes\\" with \\"fault line\\" deserves a pat on the back as does the use of REM style \\"Reckoning\\" era motifs in the brilliant \\"Calamity song\\". The rootsy \\"Rox in the box\\" sounds like a nod to Mike Scott and his folk fest \\"Room to roam\\" and for good measure the Decemberists throw in a snatch of the folk standard \\"Raggle Taggle Gypsy\\" to add spice. Meloy's acoustic guitar picked ballads are always lovely and sumptuous and \\"January Hymn\\" is one of his finest yet and will one day figure on the \\"Best of the Decemberists\\". To add icing to the cake they partly reprise it with the equally sublime \\"June Hymn\\" later in the album. Another of the album's many highlights \\"Down by the water\\" starts with a haunting Springsteen like harmonica and brilliant backing vocals from Welch and combines with faint echoes of REMs \\"The One I love\\" tantalizing in the background. It's stirring stuff and destined to rock summer festivals. Meloy also admits that the excellent \\"This is why we fight\\" owes a huge debt to the Smiths with its Johnny Marr guitar lines and rousing pace (perhaps the title of the album also tips a nod to the Smiths epic \\"the Queen is dead\\"?). The brakes are put on however for the final track the ever so gentle \\"Dear Avery\\" where Welch enlists her musical partners Dave Rawlings and fellow Portlander Laura Viers to provide backing vocals.<br /><br />\\"The King is Dead\\" is an understated album devoid of complexity, twelve minute prog epics and Gentle Giant like chord progressions. As such if this is what attracts you to this great band then some disappointment will follow since the template here is Neil Young's simple wonder \\"Comes a time\\" which has provided Meloy with the source inspiration for the mood of the album. This is very much the Decemberists \\"Americana\\" roots album, strong on songs, melodies and with choruses designed to infiltrate your head with greater effectiveness than a Paul McKenna hypnotist session. It is a real pearl of an album and proves what a great songwriter Colin Meloy has become. All in all a fantastic opener for 2011.monica and brilliant backing vocals from Welch and combines with faint echoes of REMs \\"The One I love\\" tantalizing in the background.

As such if this is what attracts you to this great band then some disappointment will follow since the template here is Neil Young's simple wonder \\"Comes a time\\" which has provided Meloy with the source inspiration for the mood of the album. This is very much the Decemberists \\"Americana\\" roots album, strong on songs, melodies and with choruses designed to infiltrate your head with greater effectiveness than a Paul McKenna hypnotist session. It is a real pearl of an album and proves what a great songwriter Colin Meloy has become. All in all a fantastic opener for 2011.

B0047IIYQI|5.0|The most successful British invention since the internet? Ok a bit of an exaggeration but this London band are taking the world by storm and equally generating a movement and a vast range of copyists. They are also a force of nature live in concert and as someone who recently lost 3 pounds \\"bouncing\\" at one of their gigs the Mumfords are the best diet you can undertake while getting throughly drunk.  As the NME tells us with pinpoint accuracy this band was \\"Formed in late 2007 through a shared love of country, bluegrass and folk, the Mumford's belong to a clique that's already scaled grand artistic peaks; performers such as Laura Marling and Noah And The Whale taking the shambling, confessional style of the New York anti-folk scene and fleshing it out for broader commercial appeal\\".<br /><br />You know the story by now so check this band of fresh faced folkies, decked out in waistcoats and beards having the time of their life. There is certainly a dash of the Pogues influence here, a bit of the Waterboys there and some Richard Thompson thrown in for good measure. Ultimately their sound is unique while the songs are all very passionate,  well written and expertly sung by Marcus Mumford through a very distinctive voice. To single out a few for your attention the lovely ballad \\"After the storm\\" is achingly beautiful and what a mature work for such a young band. Similarly the single \\"Little Lion Man\\" is a banjo driven foot tapper but with superb lyrics and narrative. Other standouts include the initially soothing \\"I gave you all\\" which is a slow burner that builds to an excellent and powerful crescendo. Mention in dispatches should also go to Waterboys \\"Fisherman blues\\" era stomp \\"Roll away your stone\\" and the thrilling high tempo folk of \\"Thistle and Weeds\\", the thumping title track and the sheer passion of \\"White Blank Page\\". You search in vain for a real duffer on this album which is hugely impressive and with the \\"The Cave\\" they have recorded one of the songs of the past decade. True this import is a bit on the expensive side Stateside although some research should find a cheaper version. In the package you get an extra song the rousing \\"Hold on to what you believe\\",  a storming live concert from the Shepherds Bush Empire in London with some versions of the songs equally as good if not better than the studio album and a fascinating DVD documentary of the band on tour.<br /><br />It's great to see that Amazon USA named this as their album of 2010 (even though it was released in 2009 in the UK). Its not perfect, but it comes very close and for a debut oozes huge potential and places a hefty weight of lofty expectation on a precociously and massively talented new band to follow it with a brilliant second outing.

B0034G4P7Q|3.0|I was so fired up to watch the Social Network because I'd heard such a huge buzz about it. I should have known that the actual social network itself is the master of modern buzz and that the hype was propagated by those in it. Don't get me wrong. It's fascinating to see how Facebook came to be and to see technical genius at work but I actually liked \\"Pirates of Silicon Valley\\" -   the story about Bill Gate and Steve Jobs - better. The movie was well done but one of the things that really bothered me was that there were highly technical discussions going back and forth and the movie makers felt the need to have loud background music during some of these discussions. Maybe they were trying to give it an essence of cool or maybe they were going for some special effect but it was more frustrating than anything else. There were a number of us of different ages watching: the teenagers went to bed because they thought it was boring and my husband went on Facebook because he felt it was more entertaining. I plugged through it but those two hours plus could have been better spent reading the Wikipedia version of what happened and then watching Toy Story 3 or The Town. I hope this movie doesn't win an Oscar although if the score does it would make sense since that's what you hear most anyway.
B002ZG980U|3.0|The concept is quite novel. Individuals can enter the dreams of others to plant ideas, as if they are the dreamer's own. It was a great topic of conversation after watching and even caused my husband and me to return to scenes for things we might have missed.<br /><br />My husband loved the movie, but I was a bit more critical. It is very similar to the Matrix; which if individuals can in many ways create their own reality in the dreams, I was confused as to why some things were possible while others were not.<br /><br />Considering in Greek Mythology, \\"Ariadne\\" is the Mistress of the Labyrinth, I was convinced that the majority if not all of the movie was proof that Leonardo's character was still trapped in a dream. His totem was unreliable due to the fact that he had sabotaged and taken it from his wife. The voices of his children on the phone were older than the images of his children at the end of the movie, so I believe at some point in the film he got trapped. Particularly before the introdution of the Ariadne character because that is an uncommon name and she coincidentally was creating mazes for the dreams.<br /><br />Its an entertaining film. Starts to get a little long around the 4th level dream, but worth watching.
B00005MP58|5.0|I was very familiar with the A&E production of Pride and Prejudice. I wanted to give it as a gift to a very dear friend of mine, not especially for Christmas. However, it came before Christmas to my amazement. She was thrilled and I was thrilled because I could not have given her a better gift. I am now and have always been completely sastisfied with everything from Amazon.
B0042U94UQ|3.0|I think Steve Carell is comedic genius. The voice created for this film is great. But, I was pretty bored throughout. I think it would be a perfect watch for the under 8 crowd, particularly boys. Lots of gadgets and machinery.<br /><br />I was hoping more for a Shrek-type film that finds common ground between children and adults. Despicable Me is cute and harmless, but one of those you may put in for the little ones when you have chores to do.
B0034G4P7G|2.0|After hearing and seeing the Golden Globes huype thought give this film a try. I'm definitely a programming nerd and thought this might be up my alley. Unfortunately found this extremely boring and at times had to wake my brain up to concentrate back on the movie. Definitely don't understand the good reviews!!
0671510991|3.0|I suppose I will try to veer from a controversial review about a controversial man. But, of what I do know of Henry Kissinger, this book was read with a grain of salt (or two).<br /><br />It was an engaging read. I was rather impressed with the writing style. Kissinger is not an easy man to listen to, with dull monotonous Draculian tone, but makes for a much more pleasant read. The history account up until the 20th Century was enjoyable. With the 20th Century, Kissinger begins to account for the foreign policies of all subsequential presidents following Woodrow Wilson. I am personally no fan of Wilson nor FDR, so he and I clash on ideology, but still the book remained impressively objective. The chapters on Nixon were possibly a bit too long and tedious, but understandable considering Kissinger's association at the time.<br /><br />I think you can tell the character of a person by not only what they reveal, but what they omit. I found it intriguing that the entire presidency of Jimmy Carter was omitted. Carter's name was only mentioned indirectly in 4 sentences in the book. It was interesting that the resignation of Agnew was overlooked. Though Kissinger did state that Gerald Ford was the only appointed U.S. president, I found it interesting that he didn't state that close associate Nelson Rockefeller was the only appointed U.S. vice president.<br /><br />I found it not only tacky, but revealing, that he referred to Mao as that \\"occasionally murderous revolutionary\\". Considering it is estimated some 6 million were killed and hundreds of thousands more \\"re-educated\\" under Mao's leadership- he may have well be saying that of Hitler and the Holocaust. Either he has a sick tongue-in-cheek sense of humor, or he is void of couth.<br /><br />Overall, worth reading, but perhaps with caution.
0312323867|1.0|After I read this book all I wanted was my money back. The lead character is a jerk and the book is predictable. I usually love the author but this is one book to skip.
B002T921DE|5.0|George Michaels was at his very best. Loved everything about the concert. Have been a GM fan for a long time and he didn't disappointment me.    The quality of the Blu-ray was excellent.
B00003CXA2|5.0|It came in great time for Christmas and was a hit!  For some reason Grandpa loves this!  He thinks it is the funniest thing and quotes it all the time.
B003H6KRIE|1.0|just like the other lady posted...the bourne identity disc is defective...it was not reading in both my PS3 and a separate Samsung Blu-Ray player....talk about disappointment...
B0000253J9|3.0|I love this cd and wanted to have this version of moments in love . What a beautiful song. It was in good condition plays fine and I am satisfied. def buy again from this seller
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Another great series from HBO on the events of WWII. If you haven't watched this, order it right now you will not be disappointed. This series will make you lie in bed and really think about your life and realize what a nation we really are. 10 out of 10.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|The book was a big hit in the UK years ago and the 'movie' version does it justice. The acting is great, the cinemaphotography brilliant, the intrigue and human foibles captivating. Makes me oh so nostalgic for those old English country days, in fact I have just bought Season 2!
B002JVWR9U|4.0|I read the books. The series is not close to them but in fact it s better than expected.  The 3 majors actors are good.  For people who like Twilight.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|After reading over the reviews i thought i would try this controller out. I let it fully charge and i read the instructions and synced it to the PS3.  I must say i am surprised with how good it works, i have used it for 3  days playing Gran Turismo 5 and i am very happy with the results.  I really enjoy the xbox 360 feel to it and not getting thumb cramps. Or the PS3 'CLAW'.   I give it 5 stars because it is the best feeling controller for the PS3 that i have used.  Compared to the toggles on a PS3 controller, there is a very slight dead spot, but it is so slight that after you get used to using the Power A controller, you dont notice it. You can make smooth turns, hold the racing line.   Also with the xbox 360 toggle layout and the dip in the top of the toggle, compared to the PS3 toggle with the hump, it feels like you have more control.   I am very happy with my Power A controller.  Update as of 2/7/2011 , after playing Gran Turismo 5 for awhile and playing the Killzone 3 Beta.  I am very impressed with the Pro Elite. Even with the default sensitivity settings of 30% with the Killzone 3 Beta ,it works great.   I know with alot of games you can adjust your sensitivity, i think more people should think about making the right adjustments in game , make sure the controller is charged and synced to their system.  I give the Power A Pro Elite a A plus.   Its the best none sony controller out there with the xbox layout.  Update as of 3/11/2011. After playing Killzone 3 and Call of duty Black Ops with this controller, I love the controller even more.   My advice to anyone who buys one of these controllers and it ends up having a HUGE dead spot in the stick movement sensitivity, return it for another one. Some of us do not have this problem and the controller works great.  Update, its 8/17/11 and the controller is still working great.  Update ,11/27/11, controller still works great, i have played ,Gran Turismo 5, Killzone 3, Black Ops, BF3, and currently playing MW3 everyday with the Power A controller. i am so happy with it i am going to buy a second one.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|i love this greatest hits, I didn't have on e by Bon Jovi. Will be seeing them in concert in February. can't wait!!!!
B00192IV9U|4.0|Much ado has been made about whether or not it is Michael singing the vocals.  Controversy aside, after listening to the album, Michael, I still enjoyed it immensely.  Starting with Hold My Hand, you can't help but feel the sense of loss when you hear Michael sing so poignantly, \\"This life don't last forever, so tell me what we're waiting for.\\"  I can't help but to tear up whenever I listen to this song.  Hollywood Tonight always gets me on my feet.  I can't see how anyone can stay still while listening to this song and especially to the beat boxing at the end.  The other songs I enjoyed are Keep Your Head Up, (I Like) The Way You Love Me, Monster featuring 50 Cent, Best of Joy, (I Can't Make It) Another Day,  Much Too Soon, and despite the ongoing hullabaloo of the vocals, Breaking News.  Having said all of this, my most favorite song on Michael, is Behind the Mask.  From the opening sound of the saxophone to the catchy lyrics, this song, which samples Behind the Mask performed by Yellow Magic Orchestra, is unmistakably Michael through and through.  I can't say enough how much I love this song.  Therefore, for those still debating on buying this album, I highly recommend it.  I'm not sorry I bought it and I listen to it daily.  That's how much I enjoy it.
1597801585|4.0|Very nicely crafted future world view.  The western culture, driven by hydrocarbons, has collapsed.  In its place has arisen a set of empires built on \\"calorie delivery\\".  Genetic engineering has caused a collapse in natural seed stocks, and only well funded high tech companies can stay one step ahead of the viruses and develop disease resistant staples.    Set in Thailand this is a tale of an undercover agent from a calorie company who is trying to locate a hidden seedbank so that his company can raid the gene stock for new product.    He is plunged into a labyrinthine world of oriental politics and culture, religious ascendancy, a surviving monarchy, powerplays by leading generals and foreign players.    A well constructed world with defined and satisfying characters that we care about.  A readily envisaged near future makes the whole construct more plausible.  All in all the best Sci-Fi read I have found in years.  No space opera or fantasy here.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Just saw this film this past week.  It was nothing short of WONDERFUL !  I've already bookmarked for a notice when the DVD becomes available.  I would see it again and again!
B003TML0VO|1.0|I have been a Santana fan since the Woodstock days. I have practically everything he has ever put out. Some are incredible, some... not so much. But through it all, one could always rely on the guitar work to carry the day. Although there is some good guitar work on this release, it certainly isn't enough to make this mess enjoyable. This is truly a piece of crap!!! Save yourselves!!!!!!! Plug your ears and run away if you ever come into audio range of this stink bomb!! I still love Carlos and will purchase further releases, but I feel that I got hosed on this one.
0307270807|5.0|I read this book when it was released back in the seventies, I in my tender twenties at the time. This book had a profound affect on me and molded the way that I will always remember the Viet Nam war. It made me aware of the true horrors of war and what we expect from our young men and women who are sent into this hell on earth. I have often thought back to this book and now think that perhaps I should go back and revisit the experience. There haven't been many books that have stayed with me this may years down the road.
B002ZG98C8|1.0|Just watched it last night with a group of 9 friends and one thing we all agreed on was that the movie looked better in the trailers. Some complained about the plot, other complained about the crucifixion of the priest and the shooting battle in the church. We did enjoy the priest, he had some great lines but the shootings and crucifixion went too far for us and ruined the movie, we dont mind the gruesome killings and slicing of body parts or the nudity, but even when you're pushing the envelope there is a limit.<br /><br />I love Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez, but I cant even imagine having this movie in my library even if they did look amazing.
0425166805|5.0|This is a very interesting book, makes you wonder everything you were ever taught!! I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this kind of topic. The author did a great job arguing topics that have been taught to us for ages now.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|I am a big fan of the Predator movies, but have been disappointed with the latest releases.  This movie takes it back to the basics, with the original soundtrack and a sound plot.  The extra features give you a great insight into the concept of the movie as well as the entire production process.  Great buy.
B004DCB62M|2.0|Kindle: It could be because I had to transfer the book from my computer via USB (I doubt it), but the table of contents and links did not work for me. I agree that the formatting is kind of strange. I don't recommend this version.    Sherlock Holmes: An amazing series!
B0042RUMJG|5.0|I received this DVD concert yesterday and could not believe the quality of the recording. I just purchased a new receiver and this concert was amazing. Not only is the video amazing but Sting shows a comical playful side while putting out one of the most amazing vocal performances backed up by the Philharmonic Orchestra as well. To top it off, it is over two hours of pure enjoyment. Do yourself a favor and purchase this top notch piece of entertainment. You will watch it over and over again.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|I am not a huge fan of this movie. It showed up on the doorstep Christmas Eve so the delivery was awesome. (earlier than stated) DVD in great shape. The case was warped but soon went back to normal shape in the heat of the house. My boys love it so it's great.
0385737955|4.0|Shucks! This book definitely kept me on the edge of my seat last night as I was wrapping up the last hundred pages between laundry loads. I've read both great and okay reviews of this book, but at its heart I believe the book seeks to be a great, gripping adventure story, and I think that within those confines alone it does deliver. Yes, there are a few pacing problems. Yes, I felt a mad rush at the end for something *big* to happen, and yes, some of the characters were a bit underdeveloped.   But as far as young adult science fiction dystopia goes (breath), I think it's a good book. The maze itself and the myriad of strange (and bug-like?) antagonists provide this sort of bizarre, other wordly contrast to the modern, common sense personalties of the boys--(reminiscent of another \\"stranded\\" tale called \\"Lord of the Flies\\"...ever hear of it)? And there's enough trials and conflicts the young men \\"must figure out\\" or \\"defeat\\" which keeps the plot line intriguing and complex. Boys especially would enjoy this work. (There is one female in the book, but she stays largely on the periphery until the end. Hopefully we'll see more of her in the \\"Scorch Trials\\").   I've read other reviews where Tommy is called a bit of a *wino*--I didn't find him \\"whiny\\" at all personally, and actually grew to trust his instincts and was able to cheer him on without pity playing a part in it what-so-ever. I liked this book. I thought it was a fun read, and I'll definitely pass it on to those middle and high school aged boys who complain that there's not enough fiction for them out there. Boys, this one....was made for you. Enjoy.
B000HEWEJO|4.0|Showed up on Christmas Eve so it was great timing. I really like this movie. Bought the DVD to replace my VHS. perfect condition.
B0043RGY60|5.0|As huge 30STM fan I could hardly wait to get this Deluxe Edition! It includes 3 bonus tracks and the DVD is so worth watching. There are 4 different covers available, I got the pink one, a friend of mine, too. I guess they send all girls the \\"pink\\" edition and boys maybe get the blue, black or gray one :)
B003JSSPSY|5.0|For anyone who loves fantasy adventures, this series is a must.  Great acting and great story (based on book by Terry Goodkind)!  I recommend purchasing it.
B0049JPU8A|5.0|This has to be the best CD put out by  The Script. Absolutely love this album. The drumming and guitar work is wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|This show is really hilarious, and yet serious in its underlying messages. This 2005 film is an adaptation of the 1964 book of the same name, which was written by Roald Dahl.<br /><br />The first message is that of loyalty and the price that comes with betrayal. Because of this, one of Charlie's grandfathers lost his job, along with all the other human employees.<br /><br />The second lesson is that of hope and destiny. Charlie, and his parents and all four grandparents live in a run down hut. His hope is to get a golden ticket that would allow him to tour the Chocolate Factory and get the opportunity to get a 'grand prize'.<br /><br />The sets and the music in the movie are really catchy, the Oompa-Loompas (all played by Deep Roy) are really cool... It is amazing how they had him do all of those roles, especially when synchronized.<br /><br />The most important lesson that I feel that this movies teaches is that children ought to obey and respect their elders. Otherwise there can be dire consequences, which are as so graphically portrayed in this film. It is a very enjoyable movie for the whole family to watch.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|After watching Band of Brothers, I anxiously awaited the release of The Pacific. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Pacific lacks the cohesion of Band of Brothers. It is difficult to feel like you ever know the characters well; the story is too disjointed. The language was foul. There were graphic sex scenes which were not necessary for the story line. The Pacific is horribly graphic. I get that it depicts war, which is graphic by nature, but The Pacific seems to focus on the gore and the deplorable atrocities committed by US soldiers. It was nauseating. I finally quit watching after the eighth episode because I realized it wasn't going to redeem itself. Instead of inspiring me with the courage and character of US soldiers and helping me to understand the war and history better, The Pacific was a story of gore and the low points of humanity. I would never have guessed Band of Brothers and Pacific were made by same people - they are so vastly different. I'm bummed.
0385341679|5.0|Not since I finished the Harry Potter series have I been so satisfied with a 'final' book. So many series peter out and fizzle. Not this one! All the characters stay true to form and no - 'I woke up and it was all a dream' For one moment I thought it was going to end like that and I was sliding into gloom but... and I head into spoiler territory. Do I wish Mack and Barrons had got it together earlier? Yes, but hey, their relationship was more than that.<br /><br />Hope Ms Moning has not finished in this genre.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I first saw this movie on Dish VOD in high def and loved it! So the first place I came was amazon to buy it in blu ray! When I first heard of this movie I was not sure what to think, and if it was not for my husband; I probably would not have ever rented it. I was so wrong! This movie is just fun from the start to the end. It was great to see all these actors together that I grew up loving. Mickey Rourke's character is fabulous in this movie. I cannot tell you how many times this movie made me laugh out loud. Yea the action and adventure is out there....unbelievable, maybe even a little superhuman . . . but isn't that what made these guys famous to begin with? They are all still looking pretty darn good to me. LOL I loved it and I am happy to now own it on blu ray.
0817439390|5.0|The book is easy to follow and understand. I would recommend this book to readers of all skill levels and ages 12+
B003L20ICE|3.0|Yes, this movie is probably being at least a little overpraised by the critics.  I suspect many of them consider it \\"brave\\" for a film to depict an ordinary American family, whose parents just happen to be lesbians.  Let's face it, awards voters and critics love anything that deals with race, homosexuality, or any of the other hot-button social topics (witness the dreck known as \\"Crash\\" winning Best Picture a few years ago).      None of which is meant to detract from The Kids are All Right, which is still quite an enjoyable small film.  The acting especially is uniformly good.  Annette Bening is sure to receive an Oscar nomination (well deserved), for her fantastic performance as Nic, the tightly-wound, more responsible half of the married couple formed by herself and Julianne Moore.  Moore is also excellent playing Jules, a more aimless free-spirit type - their differences are a source of much of the comedy in the film.  In all respects but their sexual orientation, they are a typical suburban married couple, with all the happiness and challenges that entails.    Mark Ruffalo continues to be one of the most reliably good actors working today.  He gives another standout performance as Paul, the biological father of Nic's daughter Joni and Jules' son Laser.  As is often the case in his other films, Ruffalo's acting has such ease and charm that he makes his performance look deceptively easy.  In lesser hands the character of Paul could have been the stereotypical charming bad-boy we've seen before in movies a million times.  But Ruffalo gives him a warmth and humanity that makes the audience root for him (even when he screws up).    My biggest complaint about the film was with a major plot twist involving Jules and Paul that seemed completely out of character to me.  I realize the director was trying to comment on how Paul's more accepting nature gave Jules something she was not getting from her wife Nic - but the way it was done in the film strained credibility.  Ialso thought the script was rather mean in its treatment of Paul in general... he was basically just discarded at the end of the film without even a chance at an apology.  Meanwhile, Jules makes a rather pat speech about marriage, all is forgiven, and we get a pat and not-very-satisfying ending.  The film seemed to border on being anti-male, at least that was my perception.       A word about the 2 young actors who play the kids... they both give fantastic, natural performances and are clearly talents to keep watching for as their careers progress.    Overall the great acting is what carries the rather slight story, and it is worth watching for Bening's performance alone (both she and Moore are completely believable as a lesbian couple, for what it's worth).  While I do not think it is Best Picture material, it is an enjoyable and occasionally moving portrayal of an almost-typical American family.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He loved it. He did not think I would ever find the gift pack. I knew if there was one Amazon would have it.
B0042X9L6A|3.0|The SB700 is much weaker than I anticipated. Secondly, changing the power setting is more cumbersome than on the SB800. Finally I am also having a problem that it is shorting out my D700 and I don't understand why.
096798467X|5.0|Such an inspiring book--I wanna go play in the mud, and sculpt dragons and other fantastical creatures. I've had the pleasure of eating from one of these ovens, which food was as tasty as the oven was beautiful. And the author and his wife are such very nice, and helpful, folks.
B000001G16|5.0|I love this CD! It's absolutely amazing. Personally, I like Richie's vocal style more than Jon's and Richie brought on his solo album :)
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|this box set has so much to it that my brother, already a huge MJ fan, loved it and found it full of his favorites and some he hadn't heard before. It made a great gift.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Having ordered items from Amazon in the past, I knew that I would first be getting a quality product sent in a timely manner. I was very well pleased with the whole process - from finding the item and finding the right one that I felt was the one that I knew my wife wanted. Then being able to order the item, using some of the gift certificates I had in my account.    My concern was the timing of the delivery but it came without any delays and I was able to track it's process so I knew where it was at everyday.    I will continue to shop and use Amazon because they know the meaning of customer service!    Thanks,    Don
B004AKCME8|5.0|Got this as a present for my 12 yr old sister - she had already read the books and loved this cartoon. I must say that the quality is great, looks like it's in HD even though I had purchased DVD quality. Definitely recommend this item!
B00479SVBU|5.0|I wanted to add flexibility to my car stereo and this did it.  Couple the unit with an 8 GB USB memory and you have a Hugh database of music to choose from. Having music arranged in folders makes it easy to find items.  Nice thing about is that it not only transmits the music but also file, and song information to radios that display such (so far a GM rental and my GM pickup). Great product does what it says at a great price.
B0042RUMIW|3.0|DVD is OK for on e viewing but probably wouldn't look at again. CD is OK but not the best of Sting
B000MNP2KI|5.0|The action was better than any previous Bond film. The characters, Bond (this version of Bond) and Vesper, were mesmerizing and empathetic and fascinating. I would have loved every minute had their story taken place in a grocery store rather than exotic locales around the globe at a whirlwind pace. The subsequent Craig outing, Quantum of Solace, is a mere four-star movie in comparison. This is a five-plus. Perfect across the board with twists, quirks and superhumanly imagitive bits that left me in awe.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|this is a useful book and for all those noobs out there who dont like this book you fail! this book has good info and is also funny so read this book or you will not surive the zombie horde
0312600844|1.0|I gave up halfway through this book because I just really hated it.  It annoyed me that the female character wrote her autobiography in the third person.
B0015346OM|5.0|the story is gripping and exciting but also has the senstive side to war and how it is like in  war. when in war we lose people some people say who cares we can keep on fighting but to other people it is like losing a brother and everybody who reads this pray for the soliders.
1416972250|5.0|I read this book in one day because I just couldn't put it down.  The characterizations are perfect, the action sequences are well-written, and the book is full of suspense, mystery, drama, and romance!  I'm super excited about City of Fallen Angels, which is coming April 2011!  As I said in a previous post, get these books NOW!<br /><br />By the way, Sebastien is on the cover.  I couldn't figure it out, but I googled it out of curiosity.  Good to know!
0756405890|5.0|I started reading this on the advice from a friend of a friend of a friend :) It was a very enjoyable experience.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a fantastical atmosphere with realistic characters.  This one draws you in.
0385341679|5.0|Its hard to know how to describe this book-- Its detailed its dense-- it has a little bit of everything in it.<br /><br />Theres the long sought after happily ever after...but then theres the stories that are left unfinished.  A confrontation with Dani, what will happen to Christian, what exactly is Barrons?<br /><br />Theres intense sex scenes and even more intensely emotional scenes as the rug is pulled out from Mac again and again.<br /><br />Reading it I understand now why KMM had such a hard time picking out excerpts-- there is no wasted scenes here-- no fluffy fillers used to increase page size.  Everything done and said had a purpose-- driving toward that final reveal.<br /><br />To me books are like movies-- and your favorite ones you watch over and over again-- maybe just the favorite scenes maybe the whole thing-- but each time you do you pick a up a nuance you missed previously a piece of information that makes you say WOW how could I have missed that -- its soo important -- integral to the story.  Thats how this book is-- maybe thats how she wanted it to be -- like the fabled sinsar dubh-- each time you think  you have a handle on who someone is-- what someone is-- the book is going to change the rules and leave you guessing again.<br /><br />The book is an awesome experience, get it, read it, you'll love it.
0525951652|1.0|There are a few mildly entertaining notions in this book: The first is that the educated classes are bad and the uneducated workin-classes are good. The monarchs are, of course, the worst. They are all a bunch of bumbling idiots: the king of England is a buffoon-idiot, the austrian emperor is a geriatric-idiot, the german Kaiser is an incompetent-idiot and the worse of the lot, of course, is the czar of Russia who is an idiot-idiot. The earls, grafs and counts are just a little above this level. The Welsh coal miners and the Russian factory workers and peasants are so much smarter, resourceful and articulate that it makes one wonder how is it that they are so low on the social scale. Oh, but one does not need to despair in agonizing wait for the right answer. It is rihgt here, dear reader. You silly you, did Follet not make it clear that the upper classes are bad? And oppressing? And bumbling idiots?  The second novel idea in Follet's works, not seen in any other of his, is the depravation and decadence of the priests. They all want to bugger little boys and are hard at work in spying the smart lower classes and conspiring with the not-so-smart upper-classes to keep the lower classes, well, low. The Orthodox are just as bad as Catholics (vive l'egalite, Mr. Follet!). No matter if some details are not right (Orthodox priests tell bad upper-classes individuals what good lower-classes say in the confessionals...oops, Orthodox do not have confessionals; Orthodox priests preach that it is a sin to lay with your own wife...oops, Orthodox priests actually marry and have children...). These are just details in an otherwise superbly researched book, full of historical insights and never-before seen footage of world leaders (oops...this is MY oops, I have confused the book with the movie on which it is based...).  The 3rd genial idea: sex scenes sell books (say this three times fast!). But I wonder...how does the description of a penis advance the great narrative of the fallof the giants? How does it help to make the point that society all around is changing? Maybe it does (it is a pointy object, after all) and I am just a petty nit-picker.  Most of the time, the characters are cartoonish, dialog is stiff and full of platitudes and action is predictable. A few times the author gets some things right and one can see that    he is not the worst writer of all time.  Unfortunately, bottom line: this book is a joke.  Why did I buy it? Did not, was a  gift. And I will not buy or accept the next volume of the trilogy. I would rather wait until it enters public domain (life of author + 100 years, I think) and then download it for free from GoogleBooks.
B0000DIXLM|5.0|great album
0740797719|5.0|The book, Color and Light by Mr. Gurney is the most scientific, best written, best organized, easiest to understand, and best illustrated reference book for painters that I've ever had the pleasure of reading. So glad to have found it. It will stay on my shelf, always ready to help me solve those sticky problems.  Thanks
B00005J6T0|5.0|This is Madonnas' best album. She was at her peak during this era. You will enjoy this album. Get you one.
B0044430H8|5.0|The Golden Globe award for the Social Network soundtrack will hopefully bring new listeners to the music of Trent Reznor. For those folks, let me suggest two albums by Reznor to explore if you like this soundtrack. While his band Nine Inch Nails is largely known for its industrial rock songs, in recent years Reznor began writing more gentle (but quite moving) instrumental pieces such as are found in the Social Network soundtack. As other reviewers have noted, the all-instumental Ghosts I-IV {[[ASIN:B0015FQZ94 Ghosts I - IV]]} is the Nine Inch Nails album most similar to this soundtrack, so that's a great place to start. But I would also encourage you to explore Nine Inch Nails' less well-known Still EP (also known as disc 2 of And All That Could Have Been){[[ASIN:B0009R0DJC Nine Inch Nails: And All That Could Have Been Cd 2]]}. Half of the tracks on this little gem are early instrumental pieces that lay the groundwork for the sound of Ghosts and the Social Network. The other half of this EP consists of classic Nine Inch Nails songs redone in accoustic versions that might appeal to some listeners who want the emotional power of Reznor's songwriting, but at a lower decible. The Still cd can be difficult to find (and expensive), but Amazon currently has it available via mp3 download. If you are want to start off with a couple tracks, I recommend two remarkable instrumental works, \\"The Persistence of Loss\\" and \\"Leaving Hope\\". The Still EP should be an essential part of any Nine Inch Nails fan's collection.
1594202842|5.0|After read some negative comments to WSJ article, I felt a sort of that many readers, especially readers of Chinese or Asian background, seemed falling into the trap of the editor of the article. The title was added and the article was excerpted by the editor to make the article more controversial and popular. I have to say the case of educating her daughters by Ms Chua is extreme even from the perspective of a Chinese parent, however, the extreme, I have to say on the other hand, is perfect sound and valid, a logical derivative from a perspective of Chinese culture and history, which are fundamentally different from the Western culture and history. If we have some basic knowledge of Chinese culture and history, we know from on Tang dynasty (middle 9 century AD), Keju (a selective system by national examination for all people) started until around the end of Qing Dynasty. This thousand year's system fundamentally changed Chinese people on education since all officials will be selected by the examination. Some Chinese sayings in language reflects the value of education such as there is a golden house in book, there is beautiful woman in book, etc. This month there are 1.5 million students took a national graduate examination in China, and some people called it a modern Keju. Last year 600 Shanghai school kids took examinations on math, language etc by a world organization set for over 30 countries, the Shanghai students ranked on all top three on the 3 subjects. The value of emphasizing education is continuing in China today, and for most Chinese people in US as well who might criticize Ms Chua's article but they are doing the same as Ms. Chua, only on a less extreme extent. This value works for both parents and kids, of course it requires effort and sacrifice, but can a life without effort and sacrifice become a decent life today? A balancd approach is actually an outcome and conclusion from reading Ms. Chua's book. This approach is really lacking in US education system. Don't blame teachers, blame self if failed on school!    Personally I echo and appreciate Ms Chua's book, from my personal effort experience and also from my son's, who is a college student in one of top 10 US colleges now. I have never taken the exetreme measures like Ms Chua for my son, but I never ignore the sight of his education either. However, if I wrote a balanced approach on education, the book will never be noticed, let alone criticized by people!
0743454537|1.0|This was one of the worst written books I've read.  The character development was poor, the writing was choppy, and the narrator changed at whim..  I kept having to double back to figure out who was talking.  I kept reading, hoping it was just a slow start.  Wrong.  The book gets worse as it goes along.  The plot is unrealistic.  Who would ever let a 13 year old girl sleep at the firehouse and go to the fire scene?  How do the lawyer I understand the mother's need to fight for her daughter's life, but could she be that uncaring about her other daughter until the end of the trial?  I found myself skimming pages to get through it.  The ending - well, it was so far gone for me at that point it didn't matter, but there are enough reviews about what a poor choice that was.  The changing text size is annoying.  This is the last Jodi Picoult novel for me.  I don't know why it was so popular.  Maybe people were hoping it would be better based on her previous work.
0307474712|3.0|This book doesn't live up to it's hype.  Most of the ladies in my book club would not recommend it.  We felt Dexter had no redeeming qualities, so felt no connection with him.

B002SQNM9A|5.0|Taylor Swift is one amazing songwriter, mature way behond her years, with emotional depth to each song.  She makes the songs fun to listen to and some of them are very deep and thought provoking.  The best !
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I remember my Mom taking my brother and I to see the very first Toy Story. I fell in love and have grown up with them over the years. Toy Story 3 I bought for my daughter for Christmas. There were tear jerking moments and humorous moments. This is by far one of the best Disney/Pixar movies of all time.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Gregg Allman has been making records both solo and with the Allman Brothers since the 1960's. He has never made an album like this before. With one original tune (\\"Just Another Rider\\") and a few familiar blues covers (\\"I Can't be Satisfied\\". \\"RollingStone\\" \\"Little by Little\\"), the main focus of this new CD is less familiar acoustic and electric blues songs.Producer T-Bone Burnett and Allman selected songs that are well suited to Allman's talents.   Gregg's voice is still in top form and he has the backing of a top notch band here, including Dr. John and Doyle Bramhall II. The backing is more sparse on this CD than a typical Allman Brothers CD, spotlighting the vocals a bit more. Of course, fans of the Allman Brothers Band and Gregg's solo work will love this and he may even make a new fans if some people who are not fans listen to \\"Low Country Blues\\".
B001AQTWF2|5.0|The CD was great! Whitney's voice is still absolutely powerful and she does'nt disappoint in this album. I can listen to the entire CD without skipping tracks.
1439107955|5.0|I'm not a science person. I studied the scientific method for my dissertation, but that was for psychology. I know little about chemistry, biology, and other hard sciences, BUT I couldn't stop reading this book. Some parts of it were beyond me, but I simply could not go on to something else. Most of the book is a gripping saga about people; illness; doctors and their craziness, obsession, pride, determination, and passion to discover the secret of this enormous enemy of mankind.     I learned so much just reading the history of this dread disease, and I'm still reading. My advice to readers: read this book. Knowledge is power and maybe you won't be so fearful about the unknown after you gain some understanding.     Most highly recommended. Many thanks to the author for his outstanding contribution.
1594202842|4.0|Many (including myself) were probably drawn to reading this after reading the WSJ article but the book is quite different from what one might expect. Being Chinese and brought up by a 'Tiger Mother' I can relate to her older daughter while my younger sibling was the rebel in the family. The attributes she highlights are fairly common traits in Chinese mothers although their focus tends to be academic rather than musical achievement. I would say that this approach works well for some children in driving them to achieve the seemingly impossible while in others, the psychological damage is considerable. The book is fairly light reading and I finished it in one evening. Some parts were actually quite funny particularly when she talked about her underachieving dogs (Samoyeds). The parts about her sister with leukemia were quite touching and rather than proffering advice to mothers, I think the book was actually intended to emphasize her angst and self-doubt about her parenting style as her younger child began to rebel. I actually felt quite sorry for her although clearly most of the problems were of her own making and she does admit to this. At times, her disdain for less gifted and high achieving individuals does consciously or unconsciously come through and this will undoubtedly annoy some people. Being a highly successful Yale Law Professor, I thought she was very brave to publish a book of this nature. Very few high profile professional women I know would take this risk. The act was also singularly un-Chinese where 'face', the public preservation of dignity and prestige, are highly important.
0689854684|5.0|This is a great introduction to a really fantastic story.  Great for the elementary student who excels in reading.  We've loved reading this book over & over and enjoyed the story so much that we'd purchased three copies for our school library.  If your kids are reluctant to read it show them the movie first.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I am reading the books now and its kind of differnt but  i love it and am so glad i purchased these. Def have to get the rest of the series!
0440236738|5.0|This was THE book that got me hooked on Coben, and to this day I've read most of his books.
B0046UGSNS|3.0|I would say that this is more a story about marriage/relationships.  The context of the partners being gay was different, but as for the deeper message \\" marriage is a marathon\\" that holds true despite the type of marriage.<br />There were not really any big funny haha moments , except when Julian Moore (Jules) described herself as a \\"sad sad middle aged lesbian \\".  Part of the humor being that it is hard to think of Julian Moore as a sad sad anything.<br />Annette Bening so far has gotten the awards but Julian Moore's performance was no slouch.<br />The actors who played the kids did a good job also.<br />But this is not a comedy.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I ordered this movie from Amazon.com and the movie is  delightful and wonderful to view. It's like a fairytale but gives one hope for a greater turn around when hoping for the best in life.  Great viewing.
030746363X|4.0|I like Tim Ferriss. He's definitely crazy, but his writing style cracks me up and I admire his intense passion. This book has some great ideas and insights and a certain coolness factor in its extremeness.     There are some approaches I have been and will be experimenting with in my own diet and exercise programs so the value is definitely there. That said, some are too extreme for me (taking ice baths) and are really only for the \\"all-out\\" type of person.     I give people the same advice about reading this book as I do with Tim's The Four-Hour Workweek: His ideas may be a bit radical for your taste, but most can be modified to a lesser extent. He makes you challenge your assumptions and consider a very different approach which is worth tons if you are open-minded enough to take a hard look at your current habits and behaviors. Change is difficult but hearing about a crazy yet successful approach is sometimes the kick in the pants we need to realize just how crazy some of your own \\"normal\\" approaches are.     I give Tim credit for using himself as a human guinea pig for the sake of being able to offer the rest of us an alternate way forward. There's a lot of detail in this book that I suspect may be lost on most people but he does give several options for skipping the detail which I also liked. For those who are interested and take the time to consider how they might take his advice and work with it to achieve their own goals, it'll be a valuable resource.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Shipped in time before Christmas and everything worked out wonderfully and the package came in one piece. Amazon is one of the best places to buy movies besides Best Buy.
1423134206|4.0|I bought this book and it arrived in fairly decent condition. The corner of the book was slightly bent (nothing major). I would suggest using better packaging materials. Loved the book. All in all, a very good buy.
B004AKCME8|3.0|I didn't watch the movie. I rent the movie for my 6 grade kid who read the books twice. Here is her review;           It was a wonderful work of animation, but the story is horrible. I can think of around 5 differences from the books at a time. There are personality defects, I think some of the owls look weird, and most of the story is cut out. If you have watched a bit, there is no enchidna in the story either, (though 'the doubter' part was funny.) Also, some of the diologe sonds a little corny (out loud). Bacicly, they cut out too much from the books and added worse stuff, or nothing, in place of it. I wish they had sticked more to the books.
B003L20ICE|5.0|I know there are many people out there against \\"lesbian\\" films (I know some of them myself) and I wish these people would see this movie, its not just a \\"lesbian\\" movie but about the power of love, family, and togetherness.   The film starts out introducing us to Nic (played the always fabulous Annette Bening in one of her best roles to date) an OBG/YN and Jules (portrayed by the equally talented and overlooked Julianne Moore) a stay at home mom and their 2 children Joni (Mia Wasikowska of \\"Alice In Wonderland\\") and Laser (Josh Hutcherson of \\"Bridge To Terabithia\\")in L.A. and the summer before Joni is leaving for college.   While on the outside Nic and Jules seem to have a \\"perfect\\" relationship, things aren't as what they seem. Jules has a dream of starting a landscaping business and Nic (having been through past similar situations with Jules) is less than supportive. Meanwhile their 15 year old son Laser wants to get in contact with his biological father, Paul (portrayed by Mark Ruffalo) and enlist his 18 year old sister Joni to contact the sperm bank and get the information (minors are not permitted to access such information).  Joni and Laser end up meeting Paul and take an instant liking to him and develop a secret bond with him behind Nic and Jules's backs. Laser is forced to reveal the truth to Nic and Jules after being confronted about a friend of his. The 5 have a dinner together and Jules is as welcoming as Laser and Joni but Nic is less than warm. The conversation turns to Jules' business and Paul hires Jules to do his yard.  One day working Jules confesses to Paul how Nic has never been 100% supportive of Jules' dreams and impulsively kisses him. This leads to an affair between the two. One night Nic decides to give Paul a chance and motions that they have dinner at his home (also to see Jules' work) and it seem to be working. While in the restroom Nic notices Jules' hair on a hairbrush and in the bathroom she confronts Jules who breaks down and admits to the affair.  Tensions become high in the home as Laser and Joni turn against Jules and Paul (who wants Jules to leave Nic and take the kids and be with him but Jules is determined to win her family back). The night before Joni is to leave for college Jules sets her family down and begs for forgiveness saying \\"marriage is work.\\" All 3 accompany Joni to her new school the next morning and share a tearful goodbye. With Laser in the backseat he says to Nic and Jules \\"You guys shouldn't spilt up. You're too old.\\" Nic and Jules look in the rear viewed mirror and share a giggle as they hold hands driving off.  Overall a FABULOUS movie. Great script, great story, and great performances. I HIGHLY recommend it! I can see this as the year that either Annette or Julianne will get their long overdue Oscar.
030746363X|5.0|I found the book 4 Hour Body both helpful and entertaining I like Tim's writing style as well as his zest for life and knowledge.  While i first read the book cover to cover I suggest reading it cafeteria style you will find some things appealing and somethings not so.  I especially like the new ideas for me at least of exercise that include Kettle-bells and Functional Movement Screening.    Good job Tim
B0041KKYEM|5.0|What a crazy, but wonderful, movie (and I am not a big fan of thrillers but Darren Aronofsky can almost make a fan out of a non believer) and this is one of Natalie Portman's best performances to date (\\"Closer\\" is also on that list) and she deserves all her raves she has gotten. This is the only performance (other than Annette Bening in \\"The Kid's Are All Right\\") who deserves the Best Actress Oscar this year.  The film first introduces us to Nina Sayers (Portman) who is a member of the corps de ballet of a company in New York living with her mother, (portrayed amazingly by Barbara Hershey...who deserves a Supporting Actress nod) a failed dancer herself living through her talented daughter.  The ballet is starting its new season with a production of \\"Swan Lake\\" and the retirement of principal dancer Beth (a recent AWOL Winona Ryder) and the director Thomas(Vincent Cassel) tells Nina she would be the Perfect White swan (the body of naivety and innocence)but lacks the passion to play the counter part, the Black Swan but newcomer Lily (Mila Kunis) does. He tries to test Nina but kissing her and in turn she bites his lip...causing her to get cast.  As Thomas continues to pursue and test Nina (not limiting to masturbation) and get her to come out her shell, Nina begins to have hallucinations that Lily wants to take her role (not limiting seeing herself in Lily and her mother's artwork coming to life)   One night Lily shows up at Nina's apartment wanting to take Nina out on the town and after overpowering her mother, Nina goes out. The girls proceed to go to a club and take ecstasy and return to Nina's and have sex. The next morning Nina oversleeps and rushes to rehearsal and sees Lily in her place. When Nina confronts Lily about not waking her up, Lily is confused and says she hooked up with a guy from the club. Nina and Lily's hook up was another hallucination.   A few nights before the opening Nina goes to visit a hospitalized Beth (who was hit by a car...thought by Thomas to be deliberate and a result of Beth's instability). While Nina is placing a nail file (among other items from Beth's dressing room) on a table in Beth's room, Beth reaches out and starts to stab herself. Nina runs out of the room and discovers she is carrying the bloody file.  The night before the opening Nina has some of her strongest hallucinations thus far as she is practicing. Her eyes become red and swan like, her legs becoming contorted like a swan, and she pulls a black feather from a persistent rash on her shoulder. The next night Nina overpowers her mother again (who called and said Nina was too ill to perform) and goes to the performance.  During the first act Nina's partner drops her during a lift and Nina retreats to her dressing room in anger to transform from the White Swan to the Black Swan. Lily knocks on her door dressed in the Black Swan costume and Nina's rage comes to head as she shoves Lily into the dressing mirror and subsequently stabs her in the abdomen, killing her and hiding her body. Nina goes out and brilliantly performs the Black Swan number, turning into a swan. Nina rushes back to get ready for the final act when there is another knock on the door. It is a very alive and well Lily coming to congratulating her. Nina sees that the mirror is STILL broke but looks down and sees she stabbed HERSELF. Nina goes out and does the final act and as the White Swan commits suicide by going over a cliff, the mortally wounded Nina falls into the hidden mattresses. The curtain drawn the company gathers around her and Thomas ask \\"How did you feel\\" and Nina responses with \\"I Was Perfect\\" (achieving her dream of perfection) before the screen goes white.  Overall...lots of twist and turns that are unexpected and head scratching. While Natalie's performance was great and the dedication is to be admired, it is really hard to say if she will beat Annette. The supporting cast (in particular Winona and Barbara) are what carry this movie. I do recommend this movie...another one of the best of the year!
B0042EJD8A|4.0|This movie/expose is a must see for all people where hydraulic fracturing (\\"fracking\\") is being done or proposed. Fracking, like some of the other methods of energy production and mining, is an environmentally unsound and dangerous practice that will likely cause long-term environmental damage as well as the immediate consequences shown in the movie. The movie shows a number of instances where groundwater, surface water, soil and air have been contaminated following fracking and where people and animals have been sickened and died as a result. It doesn't take a genius to figure out it's not a good idea to pump millions of gallons of water containing numerous toxic and harmful chemicals into the ground, yet this is occurring at tens of thousands of gas wells around the United States and in other countries. This movie has received lots of criticism from the gas industry and some regulatory agencies, so it appears to have struck a raw nerve with them. That's usually a good indication that there is even more \\"dirt\\" the industry would like to keep secret. It's interesting to note that the gas industry and most of the regulatory agencies chose not to participate in the movie by granting interviews.    If you are not directly affected by fracking, this is still a must see movie. The energy we are using must be produced, and that production is harming others, even if you don't think you are being harmed directly. It is just more evidence that we need to reduce our dependence on non-renewable energy sources such as gas, coal, oil, and nuclear, by conservation and more wise use of energy. We need to develop renewable and sustainable energy such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric.

141694740X|1.0|It's pages and pages of whining and excuses. What a waste of time. Never even finish this book. I don't get what the hype is about. The movie was excellent, this book is the complete opposite. I guess I'm not much of a self-help book. I much rather The MANual: A True Bad Boy Explains How Men Think,Date,and Mate--and What Women Can Do to Come Out on Top by Steve Santagati. Much better than this pity party book.

0764207407|4.0|I'm sure there will be a collective gasp across the internet when I say this, but I had never read Jane Austen before.  I'm not sure why, I just never had until I was given the opportunity to review this Insight Edition published by Bethany House.  I have to admit that I am not going to be a Jane Austen fan.  I struggled with Sense and Sensibility.  I actually felt like Tom Hanks in `You've Got Mail'.  It just was not my cup of tea, which is strange because I love books that take place in Regency England and I love Jane Austen themed books.<br /><br />But, I'm not really reviewing Jane Austen here.  I'm reviewing the Insight Edition.  This annotated edition is filled with trivia, themes of faith, and other nuggets meant to enhance the reader's experience.  I have to say that I like this concept with classic literature.  I enjoyed taking a break from the story and reading the side notes.  The notes are written clearly on the pages, but they do not get in the way of the story.<br /><br />One devoted Austen fan told me that reading a book like this is like watching a movie with the commentary on.  That can be a good thing or a bad thing.  Sometimes a reader just wants the story and nothing else.  Other readers, who may have read Sense and Sensibility several times, may appreciate having that little extra.  If that is the case, I highly recommend the Insight Edition of Sense and Sensibility for those who want to add to their Jane Austen experience.
B00386EZJU|5.0|Loved the movie and had to get the soundtrack too! I love the Celtic flavor of the music and the use of regional instruments. This music really adds to the movie.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Outstanding story if you deal with animals. It can teach you patience and insight to help you handle them with care that is based on \\"thinking like they do\\".
B001AQT0RC|4.0|Yes this is one of the only movies my Mom and I both like.  When I was young, she had me watch Cosmos with Carl Sagan on PBS.  This movie reminds me of that because it is dedicated to Carl Sagan. I knew she had seen it previously and liked it, so I got her the bluray for her new bluray player.    Jodi Foster is excellent as usual as a frustrated scientist listening to signals coming to Earth from Space in hopes of possibly finding proof of intelligent life in outerspace. Matthew McConaughey plays a very liberal preacher who isn't such a believer in her work but seems to like her very much. She's all science, he's all religion, so there's friction for a sort of attraction as a subplot.  When a signal comes to her crew from outer space, she of course wants to follow the instructions in the message to build a device/portal to take her to the originators of the message. Add in government interference, a rich old eccentric man who supports her, and a crazy religious zealot who opposes science at any cost and you've got a good movie.  It may seem sentimental and slow to some viewers, but they can't all be action movies can they?
B003L20IHO|4.0|I absolutely love this movie! It pulls at your heart strings and Zac Efron is just incredible! He is truly blossoming into someone like Leonardo or Brad pit in his acting abilities as well as in the looks department! :) The provider of this movie was good. The movie was in good condition the only complaint is there was a small scratch on the disk so there was about 15 seconds of skipping at one point in the movie. For a used disk i was satisfied though.
B000JLSM00|4.0|Although I am not a big John Wayne fan, this is a movie that I can watch every couple of years.  I bought the bluray for my Dad who just got a new bluray player. He grew up in Southern Utah where many of these type of films were shot, and he likes these type of movies. While John Wayne's acting style isn't the best or most believable and the main Native American characters look like Caucasian actors in make up, if your a movie buff, you should see this at least once.  Some of the supporting characters are very amusing as well.
0307454541|4.0|Best descriptions I've heard of this book is: \\"Dan Brown meets Silence of the Lambs.\\" There are parts that drag, but it has it's intense parts too. I was entertained.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The story is drawn out well over 500 pages and could have been edited down to maybe 400.  I did find the story slow in the beginning and here and there it took me awhile to want to read again.<br /><br />However when Stieg hooks you with a bit of info it pulls you in further.  Almost two-fifths in I found ways to take a quick break from work to read as much as I could.<br /><br />Granted there are characters that didn't even need to be mentioned.  I could have done without the detail of making coffee and sandwiches; but it sucks you in.<br /><br />I'd love to give it a Five-star; but it just missed the mark in my opinion.  I'm not going to rehash what others have already written about the details of the story.<br /><br />I can honestly say, you'll either like the book or hate it.  I doubt anyone will just be okay with the story.
B000Q66JXA|5.0|\\"Excalibur\\" is, quite simply, brilliant filmmaking, by an uncompromising, master director, who is a true artist, a poet and a painter. Boorman may be compared to visceral, British visual stylists, such as Terry Gilliam, Alan Parker, Adrian Lyne, Ridley Scott, Tony Scott, and others. But unlike other directors, he is out to please no one, only to remain true to his artistic integrity. \\"Excalibur\\" is tough and visceral, masterfully crafted, like a classic wooden roller coaster, not like the modern steel coasters (or heartless CGI effects) of today. It's like an acid trip or fever dream that gets under your skin and sweeps you into the screen. Boorman has made \\"trippy,\\" psychedelic films before, but this is his masterpiece, with meticulous attention to detail. The film only has hints of magic, not an onslaught of effects, and shows great restraint in this respect, making it a mature, realistic, adult fantasy with real themes and philosophy to chew on.    Many shots are stunningly beautiful, like a painting from one of the great masters, in terms of composition, texture, lighting and details within the frame. The iconoclastic director is a great provocateur. \\"Excalibur\\" relentlessly engages the viewer with tactile imagery and unsettling themes. Visceral elements include water, fire, smoke, mist, blood, mud, steel, rock strewn streams, craggy moats, castles and swamps, with memorable images of a woman's swollen, pregnant belly, impalement, dismemberment, armor on flesh, a crow pecking out an eyeball, rotted corpses hanging from a gallows tree, horses' steaming breath, a forest on fire, silhouettes of fighting knights, green light on the sword as it rises in slow motion from the lake, Merlin trapped in a block of ice, the list goes on. . .  Unsettling themes include adultery, incest, rape, matricide, and patricide. Boorman taps into our primal fears and instincts. A child witnesses her mother raped, a baby kidnapped, taken from its mother's breast, bloodlust, lust for a woman we cannot have, lust for true love, lust for power, hating your parents enough to kill them, taking your father's place, being a rebel trapped in a cruel dictatorship, fear of our inevitable deaths and what lies beyond. . .    Most people do not realize how masterful Boorman is at drawing us into the screen, engaging our eye and senses, and our intellect at the same time. His manipulation of pacing, tone, time, space, story ellipses, turning points, surprises and new story information, all make for an absorbing, believable experience few directors could match. His skill is precise and unwavering, invisible to most, and worthy of close examination. Many films may have bigger budgets and effects, but they are usually hurried and do not ring true, made by directors with smaller intellects, out to please audiences, without true artistic integrity. Boorman is honest and takes his time, knows what he's doing, and does it right, according to his own agenda. He makes it feel real, and you can't ask for more than that.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am a sophomore in college majoring in Computer Science and Economics (and Math), and my brother is an entrepreneur, so I can relate to this movie on so many different levels.  That's one of the reasons I love this movie so much, so I can understand if you don't think the movie is that great.  Also, I realize that this movie may not accurately depict the story that it tells.  I don't care.  The story was fantastically written and portrayed.<br /><br />I like this movie for so many reasons, but like any movie, the central focus is the characters and the interactions between them.  The characters in this movie are SO well done.  Mark Zuckerberg is simultaneously the protagonist and the antagonist.  Eduardo Savrerin is such a likable guy that gets betrayed.  The Winklevosses really don't want to get into conflict, but get dragged in anyway.  And every character has clear motivations for doing what they do.  Again, maybe it's because I relate to these people so much, but I really got attached to these characters.<br /><br />The future of every one of the characters lies in the span of this movie.  You get to see the most important moments in their lives.  You know from the beginning that Facebook is a multi-billion dollar corporation, and you get to watch as the characters vie for their stake in the company.  And in the end, you wonder if it was worth it to tear apart friendships for money.<br /><br />I have never liked a movie so much that didn't have any fancy plot twists or really cool action scenes.  My favorite movies are The Lord of the Rings and movies by Christopher Nolan, but somehow this movie drew me in like few movies ever have.  I really can't explain it, but this is definitely one of my favorite movies ever.
B00000G3AZ|3.0|Product was in good shape and arrived on time. Gwyneth Paltrow has about as good of an English accent in this movie as Kevin Spacey has of a southern accent in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Either way, it's one of the Jane Austen novels set to movie so as far as the plot goes, it was a good.
0545123275|5.0|This book keeps your interest! Great characters! Unable to put this book down! Just waiting on forever to come out in kindle addition the suspense is killing me!
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|There was a special edition VHS that had a \\"making of\\" monus material that this dvd did not have so I was a little disappointed in that respect. Otherwise a good investment. The product arrived on time and in good condition.
B0028ER4PK|5.0|I noticed a number of people complaining the vinyl they received skipped/looped. Mine did too on side B but then I cleaned it and taa-dah no skipping. New vinyl does not == clean vinyl.<br /><br />The packaging is nice, the clear see through part on the front is a trip. The sound is wonderful. Time was put into this and it shows. Subtle effects seem more pronounced such as rain on riders of the storm come through nicely. The bass guitar sounds amazing, I kid you not much better than the digitized version.
0375831002|5.0|The book was an easy read (it's for young adults).  It also provided a different perspective in story telling.  Death provides an objective and impassionate point of view as the narrator.      The main character Lisel is real with real human flaws - I'm sure that's what makes her so likeable.  Yet she also is an extraordinary young girl who exhibits great courage under extremely dangerous circumstances.    The book is for young adult readers but old and young alike will not be disappointed.    This book can give young girls a much better role model than many of the young adult books on the market today.    The Book Thief is a great read - you won't be disappointed.
B0036TGSIK|1.0|Another childish attempt at shallow humor...The story of a teenager doing 'anything' to be popular is so trite but what is really disgusting is the portrayal of the Christian students who are presented as dimwits...Anyone who has any exerience in public schools will tell you that for the most part the kids who are influenced by the Christian, Jewish and Buddhist teachings are usually the school leaders, great students and filled with common sense...but this character smirking must go on so as to diminish the influence of people who have found POSITIVE ways to live compared to these down graders of our civilization
B003UESJHO|5.0|Overall, you'll appreciate the realism of The Fighter. The characters struggle through emotional, worn out lives. Unlike the clean Hollywood settings, this film shows it in the homes and communities of average Americans. Additionally, the movie portrays people and their conflicting relations. The actors performed this exceptionally well. Bale portrayed a fallen champ struggling with addiction, and Wahlberg prepared three years for his fighting skill and body. The boxing was real and painful as he confessed on NPR. In the end, The Fighter goes toe-to-toe with life and knocks it out.
B002PLALCO|5.0|ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE BEST CONCERT DVD'S I'VE EVER SEEN AND AM SO GLAD TO OWN! IF YOU'RE A PINK FAN...THIS IS A MUST TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION! EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT A PINK FAN...YOU NEED TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION! I GIVE IT 100 STARS!
B004DK49DW|4.0|Getting some new Social Distortion is always a good thing, but unfortunately it doesn't happen often enough. I would say if you are a fan of Social Distortion or the solo albums by Mike Ness then you will really enjoy this album. It starts out with the instrumental \\"Road Zombie\\". I'm not really a fan of instrumentals especially when there are only 11 tracks on the cd, luckily though the other 10 songs are pretty good. I love the cover version of Hank Williams' \\"Alone and Forsaken\\" and also \\"Machine Gun Blues\\" which is one of the few harder rocking songs on the album.  There isn't a whole lot different on this release than previous Social Distortion albums. The songs \\"Can't Take It With You\\" and \\"California\\" have some female backup vocals that I could really do without, but that is my only complaint so far.  Overall this release is a little mellower than  past albums, but a really solid album as usual from Mike Ness and Social Distortion.  I am definitely liking it even more and more with each listen.
0312600844|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Perhaps even a great one.  The one-star haters for the most part never tell you WHY they dislike it so and dismiss a five hundred page book in three sentences!  We're supposed to be guided by remarks like \\"you're a loser Oprah!\\"  Come on people.  Get off your sedentary backsides and THINK!  At least pretend to be articulate.<br /><br />Freedom, like Vanity Fair and Balzac's Human Comedy contains many stories within it, each shedding light upon the many and diverse types of a generation.  And that is Franzen's objective--to not just tell the story of a person or persons but to chronicle a generation's high idealism in the 1970s to the nadir of the Bush years in the middle of the second Iraqi war.  The book is witty and sharp and the author spares none of us our hypocrisies (THAT in my opinion is the singular reason so many hate it.) Though I will say he is particularly harsh on conservatives. Hates them with a passion.<br /><br />We first meet Walter and Patty when in college and their journey through marriage, along with their rock star friend and gentrifying neighbors.  As their stories unfold and kids are brought into the fold, Franzen balances their lives with a fascinating look at our culture; our wanton consumption; our obsession with all-things cool and our so-often frustrated attempts to find happiness and a bit of meaning in this sloppy mess.  The digressions into politics and culture are not merely casual rambles, they are wonderfully integrated into the lives of characters who are looking for money, power or meaning in a world that is decaying physically and morally.  You may not like the message but it is powerful and beautifully realized.<br /><br />Twenty-five years ago Tom Wolfe was hailed as the chronicler of a generation.  That mantle in my opinion has passed to Jonathan Franzen, and he wears it very, very well.<br />Give this book a try, and try it with an open mind.  It has much to offer.
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|The first of the 4 movies rebuilding Evangelion is very close to the source, and is very good. I won't talk much about the movie because i think this is not the purpose of reviewing a product.    The presentation of the blu-ray is great, a digipak package, it comes also with a good booklet that is indeed worth reading.    The movie is presented here in one of the best transfers i've ever seen for an animation, everything is amazing and full of detail, color balance is also very good, i'd ive 5/5 for this amazing image.    The problem with the edition is really the extras, there's almost nothing for the fans, just a 15 minute slideshow with production evolution of the movie with music, the rest is just trailers and a music video, very disappointing, sometives i feel that the producers held back the extras for another relaese, which is a thing many do and that have been done with Evangelion in the past. Well if they do this after the fourth movie, then i'm ok since will be watching this blu-ray many times.    If you're a fan of Eva and japanese animation you should buy this.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|From the opening harmonica of \\"Don't Carry it All,\\" with the beautiful harmony of sung voices and wonderful instruments, to the final chords of \\"Dear Avery,\\" the newest release from the eclectic prog-folk band the Decemberists is a great addition to their impressive catalog.<br /><br />The King is Dead is in many ways similar to the types of songs the Decemberists are known for.  Catchy tunes, entertaining ballads, and music that sounds great to the ears.  However, what's different with The King is Dead is the simplicity of the songs.  A lot of stuff seems stripped down and bare, yet through it all it has a strong Decemberists vibe.  In fact, the simplicity gives almost a feel of listening to some old folk album, something almost Americana, almost country, but not quite.<br /><br />One noticeable difference is how short this album is.  There's not a song over five minutes long, which again seems odd for the band, but each song on TKID is tight and well-done.<br /><br />One final note was that I really enjoyed the guest vocals Gillian Welch offered on a few tracks.  I'm a fan of her music and voice, and her harmony with Meloy is nothing but natural.<br /><br />If you're a fan of slow songs that belong to the forgotten genre of country music, this album is for you.  If you like your old-school folk, this will certainly fit in your collection.  Really anyone who likes simple music, great singing, and strong songwriting would enjoy The King is Dead, or I imagine they would.  As a fan of all the other albums in the Decemberists discography, this one does not disappoint.  Not the best, but still exceptional.
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|First off, why did this film receive so many accolades?  And why did this film receive so much attention?  Facebook is a social and technical phenomenon. 2010 in essence was the year of the Facebook, capped off by FB founder Mark Zuckerberg receiving \\"Man of the Year\\" distinction by Time Magazine. And the fact that he's worth billions of dollars.<br /><br />Let's get to the movie. Aaron Sorkin's script is superb mainly because this is largely a conversation-driven movie, with very little, if at all, action. If your movie is going to be largely conversation driven, it better feature sharp, crisp, and crackling dialog. And Sorkin does it. The actors are superb in their delivery. But I found myself half-way into this film, becoming bored. Yup, bored. It became a tiresome exercise watching how Zuckerberg \\"screwed-over\\" his business partner and the twins who to this day allege that Zuckerberg stole their idea for FB. Justin Timberlake does act well as Sean Parker. And it's interesting to learn how important a role Sean did play in getting FB the VC funding it needed to get so big.<br /><br />The fact is, you know the outcome of this film from the beginning. So why is this story so engaging from the start? It's actually not a terribly engaging story to begin with. But the fact that there's never been a film done before on a young individual such as Zuckerberg who founded a billion dollar company makes it novel. I've lived and breathed the Internet start-up atmosphere so watching it on screen didn't make it anymore entertaining to me. Again, the controversy surrounding the founding of FB, the relationships that Zuckerberg had with his business partner and his alleged stealing FB from the twins at Harvard, just didn't captivate me the way it seemed to everyone else.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. This is a well-made film. But I don't see any reason why I would watch this movie TWICE. So instead of buying the DVD, I recommend you go rent this film out from your local library. I don't think this film deserved all the accolades it has received and I don't think it deserves best film of 2010, either. Again, all the hoopla behind FB is what propelled this movie to begin with. Much more so, than the \\"greatness\\" of this film.film deserved all the accolades it has received and I don't think it deserves best film of 2010, either. Again, all the hoopla behind FB is what propelled this movie to begin with. Much more so, than the \\"greatness\\" of this film.
1439181780|5.0|I loved THE POWER as well as THE SECRET. I recently watched some videos on YouTube explaining an experiment done by a Russian scientist on emotional-frequencies and DNA. Apparently, we only have a few DNA strands that are active, and the rest scientific (West) community calls \\"junk\\". What these Russian scientists did was to see how emotion of LOVE affects DNA, well, it ended up having a very high frequency (shorter wave length), so it touched many parts of DNA -thus activating it. With fear, the wavelength was long, so it only seldom touched or activated DNA. If you search on google for \\"Groundbreaking Russian DNA Discoveries\\" you should find some info, as well as watch videos on YouTube \\"Russians Change DNA with Frequency Experiments (1/2)\\" and \\"The DNA Phantom Effect\\".<br /><br />I also encourage everyone who liked THE SECRET and THE POWER to watch \\"What the Bleep Do We Know\\" and research work of Masaru Emoto, who explained through his experiments that when we isolate our thoughts, be positive or negative, and focus them on specific objects, such as water or rice, we affect their physical manifestation. The water particles affected with LOVE thoughts and GRATITUDE presented the most beautiful snowflakes (these can be found on Google Images). Same outcome was confirmed by the rice experiment.<br /><br />Also, if anyone is interested in NDEs (Near-Death Experiences), what can be noticed is that 99.99% of NDEs describe God as Non-Judgmental Unconditional LOVE, and what a better example one can follow than God?
0380820846|5.0|There is something very personable about Penelope and Colin. That Colin doesn't know what to do with his life isn't a usual dilemma the hero faces, but I understand that about him so well! That contrast in Penelope, at once self-doubtful about herself because she's a spinster and also so strong and certain as a friend/writer/sister is soo endearing and admirable. This is all made possible because Quinn is a hilarious writer and develops her characters well. It's a lovely story about a friendship that develops into a love. And that scene on the balcony in the end has to be the most cleverly written, wonderfully romantic, hilariously dramatic scenes of all time! :)

006056251X|5.0|I think I know why people adore this book, so much so that it became the first of Kleypas' books to hit the New York Times. The reason is Sebastian: 1) Sebastian loves sex, that he insists on another chance with Evie and the bargain he makes is delightful awfully shocking, but such a guilty pleasure to read... -.- 2) The absolute shattering love he feels for Evie, that gun shot scene is terrifyingly delightful, such dark drama. 3) Evie has her way with him near the end. All right that's not really Sebastian per se, but his reaction to it the whole time with endearing and hilarious. In other words, the dark brooding hero typical of Kleypas makes this novel, but what a hero!!! Get it, it'll make you shudder in delight. ;p

B004132I4S|5.0|Futile Devices: The acoustic guitar is not representative of the work as as a whole and reminds me of Kings Of Convenience but with more instruments. A short, gentle start.   Too Much: Here we first hear the electronic beats, brass, strings and backing vocals that pervade much of the album. It is a very dense sound with a cracking tune. Phenonemal track.   The Age Of Adz: Big Booming Intro with dramatic backing vocals give way to more multi layered beats, follow on trumpets, electronic baselines and choirs. Settles down at the end. The music probes and swells and comes to rest and is admittedly very good although there is something very uneasy and edgy about it throughout. Another total winner.   I Walked: great vocals here by Sufjan with personal break up type lyrics. more of a relaxed poppy style here. - sounds a bit 1980's - really great   Now That Im Older: oos and aahs just at the right time - singer can look at love differently now he's older - absolutely gorgeous - wonderful track   Get Real Get Right: 'With the Lord' - Tuneful. a decent track in the context of the Royal Robertson theme. Prophets. A spaceship is mentioned - as is outer space. Not quite as good as the others so far  Bad Communication: Sufjan slows down - sufjan resolves conflict with ray guns rather than talking things through in an adult fashion  Vesuvius: a very strange track - not my fave but hey  All For Myself: The album picks up a bit again here. The electronica does not distract but rather enhances - decent cut.   I Want To Be Well: Sensational Track. Deeply emotional lyrics about someone struggling with illness and i think the most successful blend of electronic bleeps, traditional instruments, backing vocals and lyrics, tune, the lot and the type of thing sufjan was striving for on this record. Not one for children's parties. Best on the album and probably in his career thus far.   Impossible Soul: This exhausting record concludes with this 25 minute track that twists and turns in various directions yet hangs together rather well.There are lots of subtle touches that reveal themselves with repeat listening - this one has grown on me a great deal. I really like the 'long lunar note' just before the final part.  wished he'd released the below on 1 cd - on a different musical plane at times is sufjan - what next ?  Too Much  Now That Im Older  I Want To Be Well  All Delighted People (Original Version)  The Owl And The Tanager  Djohariah  Impossible Soul

B00000AFFF|2.0|was a little dissappointed...and... sleepy \\"zzz...zzz..zzz...\\"i cannot blast this record with the one star rating i typically save for crap like britney spears, menudo, or michael bolton, or beyonce.however, this album is kind or boring and not very memorable. yes some of the arrangements are ok. there are a few decent tunes on here, the most noteworthy is God give me strength, which was included in the movie, grace of my heart. i will sort of give it the benefit of the doubt, maybe i simply haven't given this album enough listens for it to grow on me. but, that being said, i have owned it for a quite few years already and maybe have heard it five times or so. unless you're a hardcore e.c. fan, you may want to pick up a 'greatest hits' comp, or my aim is true. also, there's some great late period stuff, like spike or if you venture into the world of bootlegs, try to track down mccartney and mcmanus, a series of unreleased recordings with e.c. teaming up with paul mccartney (the songs they worked on on those sessions made their way onto assorted solo efforts from both artists,albeit in different versions0

B00377V6J2|4.0|le CD n'a pas d'intérêt si vous avez déjà la version normal.  le DVD est une pièce inestimable pour un guitariste.  quelques soient ses défauts,peu importe.  vous aimez la guitare quelque soit le style.c'est un chef-d'oeuvre.  ok,la session 1 est de mauvaise qualité sonore,mais c'est ça l'intérêt.  elle est brute,montre vraiment selon moi,qu'A KING ne voyait Stevie Ray avant ces sessions que comme un autre guitariste blanc qui voulait jouer du blues.  et plus la session 1 avance plus il voit le génie qu'il est en train d'écouter.  A.King est un génie lui même,tous les guitaristes du monde jouent ses plans à cette même seconde.  et là,on lui présente un petit guitariste blanc dont il pense(comme ce sera plusieurs années plus tard avec Gary Moore)qu'il va lui en mettre plein la vue techniquement.  mais la session 1 devient un Buff entre le maitre et l'élève qui est un génie.  et Albert King adoube l'élève en direct.  la session 2 est tellement retravaillée et remontée,j'imagine pour ne pas montrer Albert king moins bon que Stevie Ray.,bref,qu'elle est moins intéressante que la session 1,même s'il y a de morceaux terribles pour un amateur de blues que c'est toujours indispensable.  tout est indispensable à un amateur de blues ici.

B003DZX44I|5.0|Bought this for my wife over the holidays. You can definitely tell that it has been remastered and this is also the first blu-ray I have purchased. We were very satisfied with the quality and bonus features, etc. It didn't hurt that this is probably the best Disney animated movie in 30 years.
0312600844|1.0|Hated it. A complete waste of time, hours of my life, I will never get back.  Don't waste your time reading this book. It was awful. Thanks Oprah, you are a looser.
030746363X|4.0|I know the author tells you not to read it cover to cover, I found this book overwhelming in its scope - but in a cool way. Its like some crazy odd reference book that I can see myself looking into for years.
1416550550|3.0|The book was okay. I got sucked in quickly and ended up devouring it, which is a good thing. By the end, however, the constant era and perspective switching was fatiguing rather than interesting. As someone who used to absorb fairy tales at a frightening rate, I found the fairy tale parts kind of boring. Real fairy tales are dangerous - they get into the primal parts of your brain and muck around in there. The fairy tales embedded in this book felt neutered and overly biographical. And a lot of the minor characters felt like they had almost the same voice.     Overall, if you liked the other books by Kate Morton, I'd guess that you'd like this one... but it won't be your favorite.
B000LB7G00|4.0|I bought this mouse for use at work in SolidWorks 2011.  It works awesome for what I need it to do, which is simply manipulate models so I can mate them together or alter them.  Much less painstaking than using the keyboard and mouse to zoom, rotate, and pan.  I really like that you can customize how the two side buttons function, and you can adjust the sensitivity of the controls.  I like having the zoom set to a semi-high speed so I can get around, and it was very easy to adjust this on the fly.  You can also turn the LED light under the cap on or off, so if you are running this on a laptop battery and want to conserve electricity this comes in very handy.<br /><br />I use this mouse as well in Google Earth (on break of course (: )and it makes it a lot of fun to zip through cities and over mountains.  The only complaint I have is that sometimes when I try to decrease elevation (press down perpendicular to the table) the view starts rotating counterclockwise, but I don't know if this is an issue with the mouse or the program, since I do NOT have this problem in SolidWorks.<br /><br />I was introduced to the SpaceExplorer at a training course and liked using it, but didn't need all the extra buttons.  If you're looking for a 3D mouse that is very easy to use right out of the box and you don't need all the bells and whistles of the other devices, this purchase would definately be worth your money!<br /><br />Update - December 29, 2011<br />The 3D mouse I purchased started having some issues in SolidWorks where the model would spin uncontrollably. I contacted the 3donnexion customer service and they ran me through some tests.  When those came back negative they shipped me a new mouse free of charge, I only had to cut the cord of the faulty device and send a scan cord end with tag as proof of destruction.  Customer service gets a gold medal in my eyes.  Very professional, knowledgable, and courteous.  The new mouse works like a dream.  Absolutely AWESOME product.
030758660X|5.0|I love this book with it's many different and creative patterns.  I have made atleast half a dozen of the wolf hats in the child size and they knit up really quick.  I can do 2-3 in a day depending on how much knitting time my family gives me.  The pattern was easy to follow and I found no mistakes.  Definately a great book for any one who is into the Twilight or Vampire Diaries series like I am.  I love the names of the patterns too and the little Vampire and Werewolf tidbits added through out.  Wonderfly done.
0783226888|5.0|My teen son watched it and said I'd like it. He was right. How could you not love a movie with Bruce Willis, Richard Gere, and Sidney Poitier in it? The drama & story line are original, the action is fun.
B002MHG47W|5.0|I've never quite understood most Jazz, but that doesn't seem to matter with Vijay Iyer. He creates some of the best music to listen to in all situations, background music, driving music, and best of all he truly entertains when I just sit down, close my eyes and listen. While all Vijay Iyer albums are great, this one is definitely the best.

B004DK49DW|5.0|I bought this album this morning as it was just released today. I've given it a good listen, and if I had to come up with one word to sum it all up, it'd be mature. These guys sound as if they're 100% in their element. It sounds as if they had a lot of fun making these songs. While not punk for the most part, they do convey a lot of energy in their own right. It's 25% rock, 25% country, 25% blues, 15% punk and 10% rockabilly.     The album comes in the newer cardboard packaging and contains a very cool fold-out poster with lyrics on the other side.      As mentioned by another reviewer, if you enjoy the solo efforts by Mike Ness or Social Distortion's Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell, you'll most certainly enjoy this album. Social Distortion has evolved through the years, but they've also gotten older. I've been a fan for over 20 years now and can say I'm moving right along with them. Alghough I still listen to a lot of punk, heavy metal, and alternative rock, I find this album to be very refreashing. I've never been a fan of country outside of greats like Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard, But in this case it works. It works because Social Distortion has effortlessly tied together their influences to bring us a very enjoyable album.     There aren't a lot of artists out there that can provide the same level of energy and compassion after playing for over three decades. However, Social Distortion has managed to capture and bottle that energy up, which makes for some fun listening. Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes may not be for everyone, but if you're like me and have aged (not so gracefully), and evolved musically from the early punk days of the 80s, do yourself a favor and pick this one up. You won't be disappointed.
B00275EHJG|4.0|We all love the Toy Story movies and the third one is just as entertaining.  I like the first one the best but my pre teen kids love them all.  Gotta see the special features and the \\"shorts\\"  lol......
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I have watched many a British series, but this is by far the best. I wasn't so sure the first few episodes, but by the fourth I was hooked! So much more uplifting than any of the other characters. And I've read a few negative comments about Thomas the postman and I must refute them. I think he is played splendidly. And I've actually known people like him so I don't think it was ridiculous writing at all! In fact, all of the characters are believable and well developed. It's a joy to watch.
B002ZG981E|5.0|From the beginning, you know you're not in Kansas anymore. Inception had me hooked with it's well thought out plot, amazing musical score, mind-blowing special effects and a really good performance by Leo. This is a must see in Blu-Ray.

B0038BBA4I|5.0|Sigh No More is by far the best disc of 2010. The quality of the music, lyrics, and harmonies is incredible, particularly for a debut album. I can't get enough of it!
B0046U4KG0|3.0|This film was entertaining enough, as far as remakes go.    However, why would you call a film that promotes KUNG FU, KUNG FU and even more KUNG FU \\"The KARATE Kid\\"??? It had nothing to do with karate, and if they had named it \\"The Kung Fu Kid\\" I think people would have understood that it was a plot remake.    It's insulting to both karate and kung fu. Think I'm exaggerating? Answer me this: Would you make a film about baseball and call it \\"The Longest Yard\\"? Would you make a film about football and call it \\"The Bad News Bears\\"?    They are to distinct and separate sports / martial arts. The title of this film promotes the orientalist mentality that everything Asian is indistict: \\"It's all the same. All those people look the same. Karate? Kung Fu? It's all the same.\\"
B0046UGSNS|2.0|Excellent cast. Spotty script. Viewer must be prepared for inclusion of porn. I thought the way porn was introduced was too direct and detracted from the storyline. However, I may just be a fuddy-duddy.  Anyway, it became apparent at story's end that \\"The kids were not all right\\".
B000JK8OYU|5.0|George Martin is a genius.  Many purist hate this album because George and his son Niles cut and pasted (edited) many songs together e.g. Drive My Car has the guitar solo from Taxman.<br /><br />The sound is incredible.  George & Niles used any recorded Beatles whether on the released version of a song or whether on an alternate take in the vaults e.g Martin used an alternate bass line for Hey Jude.  The only song where something new was added was While My Guitar Gently Weeps.  This was the original demo that George introduced to them with just him singing and playing acoustic guitar.  It is very beautiful and personal but George Martin felt somehting was missing so he asked Olivia Harrison (wife) if he could add strings.  She agreed but had the final say.  She loved it.<br /><br />Some of the standouts are:<br />Because:  Just the voices.<br />Eleanor Rigby: Re edited and makes it more beautiful.<br />I Want To Hold Your Hand: They way the intro is set up makes you feel them in the room.<br />Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows: WOW.  Spliced and must hear it to believe it!<br />and every other song which has too many details to discribe.<br /><br />This is as good an album as any of their others!<br /><br />Now the topper.....I got to see the Love show in Las Vegas and it was on the same level of excitment as seeing Paul McCartney live for the first time.  Really.  Each seat has two speakers in the arms, behind your head, and in the back of the seat in front of you.  INCREDIBLE!  It was a very moving show having grown up with The Beatles.  I went with my wife and adult children who also learned to appreciate The Beatles with them paving the way for new and different things.  This was a very emotional experience hearing this album with a visual.  It was so good I went back 6 months later.
B00158K0S8|5.0|This is a classic movie that I highly recommend.  The soundtrack is wonderful and adds a lot to the movie.  My family enjoyed the purchase of this Blu-ray edition of Patton because of the extra features.  The bonus material was very interesting especially the history of Patton and where he came from. The segments about how people felt about Patton good and bad was also very interesting.
030746363X|5.0|I've picked up a few book on working out and diets over the years and to be honest they all pretty much repackaged the same old ideas. Tim's book is different. Very different. Those old repackaged ideas are challenged or debunked and new exciting alternatives presented. If you've been looking for something new to change the way you look at the gym and working out this is the book to buy.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|This is a very good CD. Greggs voice is the best I have heard him sing in a long time. He takes every tune and make's it his own. Now that he has is health back he is singing with a passion I have not heard in awhile.  I highly recommend this CD you will not be disappointed.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|So...we got this for my father-in-law for Christmas.  He's the type of guy that's impossible to buy for because he hates computers, cell phones, most any type of modern technology, doesn't care about clothes, and has more tools than Sears.  However, he was in the Navy when he was younger and tends to love war stories on VHS or DVD (now that we finally got him to learn how to use a DVD player!).  When he first opened this, he thought it was a documentary, said a cursory \\"thanks\\" and that was about it.  Since he's had a chance to watch it, he's realized that this is a story, and he's been telling EVERYONE how great this story is!  Now, having not seen \\"The Pacific\\" myself, I have no idea if the story would appeal to everyone, but for the guy who is impossible to buy for and loves war stories, this is apparently a GREAT set of DVD's.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Looking at the reviews it seems like many viewers haven't understood this movie for what it really is - a comedy!    THE TOURIST is an absolute parody of today's quintessential spy thriller, and the brilliance is that I went into this film thinking it was a drama and realizing by increments that it was the absolute opposite.    20 minutes in I began to realize that one can look at it two ways: it could be an awful, awful attempt at a dramatic thriller with awkward lines and over-utilization of it's eye candy main leads. The look of the film, with plenty of Venice and Paris in the mix, is gorgeous - but Angelina Jolie is used almost as a setting in herself with so many long pauses for the audience to presumably savor the look of her. And the plot line, swooping music and script itself is stale and recycled.    Or those awkward lines, pauses on Angelina, and god-awful Russian gangsters are something else: absolutely hilarious. THE TOURIST, whether or not it aimed to be so funny, succeeds in being a top-notch parody of traditional thrillers. By the end, the bizarre twists and humor had reached such a peak that I was practically crying from laughing! Watching actors Depp and Jolie interact is fascinating when viewed in the right light - it's a parody of a dramatic whirlwind romance, not a real one.    Lighthearted and unexpected, THE TOURIST is hilariously awkward in the best way possible.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|\\"The Way of Kings\\" is the first book I've read on a Kindle, as the device was a Christmas 2010 present from my parents. I have to say that the Kindle is a lot more comfortable than holding a 1000-page book, especially when you travel. I'll first comment on the book generally as a work and then make a couple of Kindle-specific comments at the end. I don't intend for this to be a review of the Kindle, but I do think it's fair to comment on aspects of THIS book as I read it on that device so that others considering the e-book purchase will have the benefit (if any) of those thoughts. I also want to avoid spoilers. As one of the lead reviews said, I read it spoiler-free and I found that to be very valuable.    I was quite impressed with the book. I've read \\"Elantris,\\" the Mistborn trilogy, and \\"Warbreaker,\\" as well as the two Wheel of Time volumes, and as far as Sanderson's own work goes I think this one is the most mature work so far. I've always loved a good LONG book that will absorb you to the point where you can get deep into the story before the book is over. It frustrates me insanely when a book feels like it's over before it gets started. \\"The Way of Kings\\" definitely doesn't do that. But it's also not written to a depth that makes it impossible to follow what's going on or to track the multiple storylines. As much as I love the Wheel of Time, it can get frustrating trying to remember which character is doing what at any given point (a problem surely exacerbated by the slow publishing schedule, though I recognize the extenuating circumstances there in recent years). As other reviews have noted, this book focuses on three main characters and sticks with each one for several chapters at a time, allowing you to immerse yourself in that character's activity before the focus moves. I like that because it allows me to absorb myself more than the style where each chapter jumps you to a different place. That latter style can be effective in giving you a frenzied feelingif a lot is going on, or if storylines are converging, but \\"The Way of Kings\\" is the first volume of what is to be a massive series. The other thing Sanderson has done is that he's introduced some characters who will clearly play big roles in the future, but he's held off on focusing too much on them, perhaps so as not to fragment the story too much too quickly. I appreciate that. If you read this book, you MUST, and I underscore MUST, remember that you are reading the first volume of a very long series, so you cannot allow yourself to get too focused on a plot point that isn't explained or a character who only appears sporadically.    I also rather like the lack of explanation of a lot of things in the story. Sometimes I find it frustrating when a fantasy author introduces new concepts without explaining them. This is the first time Sanderson has done that; in the Mistborn trilogy, for example, I thought Kelsier explained Allomancy fairly well. In \\"The Way of Kings,\\" we learn about the highstorms and the spren and some of the world's history, but we don't learn a LOT about them. We don't even necessarily learn a lot about some of the major characters, other than the backstory relating to Kaladin (told via a series of flashbacks). Robert Jordan would have used his famous line \\"RAFO\\" (\\"Read and find out\\") in reference to a lot of these things, and now that I've finished the book I think that a lot of the questions the book leaves open seem to me to have been written that way as plot points for future volumes. Sanderson loves to throw in some major plot twists that will surprise the reader, and this book is no exception. But here, those plot twists serve as major points that will--if you enjoy this book--whet your appetite for future volumes. I'll also mention that some other reviewers have noted that some of the magic in this book, particularly at the start, shows some similarities to the Allomantic material in the Mistborn trilogy. When I started reading the book Iwas initially a bit wary because I wondered if we'd be seeing something of the same sort (perhaps along the lines of how some readers criticized David Eddings's Elenium and Tamuli series for largely telling the same story that the Belgariad and Malloreon told). After reading the whole book, it's apparent that the particular type of magic in question is something that is to be developed in future volumes. So if you start reading this and your alarm bell goes \\"Mistborn Redux, I already read this,\\" hit the snooze button on that alarm!    All in all, a very well-done work in my opinion. I thought that some of Terry Brooks's early Shannara books (the original trilogy and the Heritage of Shannara quartet) had a depth to the story that has been lacking in most of Mr. Brooks's more recent works, and (aside from the Wheel of Time) I've been waiting for another author to come up with a deeper story along those lines, as opposed to the shorter trilogies that have become common. Terry Goodkind came close with the Sword of Truth series, and while I enjoyed that series a great deal, some of the lengthy speeches and a few repetitive plot points (Richard feeling betrayed by Kahlan) took away from an otherwise good work. Where I think \\"The Way of Kings\\" differs from those works is that Brandon Sanderson has done more than simply inventing characters, countries, and a system of magic. He's invented a world in which he's contemplated the full ecosystem, if you will--the weather, the creatures, the history, the lost lore, etc. To put that differently--every author has weather involved somewhere. It snows on Caradhras (Tolkien). Belgarion nearly causes an ice age with a thunderstorm (Eddings). Sanderson has taken the weather and made it into an important--though by no means fully-explained as of yet--aspect of the plot. I'm going to be interested in seeing where he goes with this one.    I said I'd mention a couple of points about the Kindle edition. I would have given this book five stars, but I took off a point for the Kindle edition because I found the maps and illustrations extremely hard to read (in some cases, almost impossible). I would have liked to have studied the map of Roshar in detail, but the Kindle simply doesn't allow you to zoom in enough to do this in the level of detail I'd prefer to do. I found myself going back to the map fairly frequently, and the Kindle's \\"Back\\" button is very useful for returning to your point in the text when you do that. One of the lead reviews here on Amazon talks about the artwork in this book being outstanding and a rare addition to a book of this sort. That may be--but if you read it on the Kindle, as I did, don't expect much in terms of the artwork. I do not know whether the inability to zoom and move around the images is a limitation of the Kindle itself or a limitation set by the publisher. I suppose I should do some nosing around online (maybe Sanderson's site) to see if I can find a downloadable map of Roshar. The other thing I have to wonder is whether the chapter artwork might prove to have some meaning at some point. Like the other art, the chapter art just isn't really all that distinct on the Kindle, although I haven't looked at the hardback to compare it. I recall how in the Mistborn trilogy the quotations and other blurbs that began each chapter proved to be very important in terms of revealing things, so I can't help but wonder if the chapter illustrations here might prove similar. As someone who intends to continue reading future volumes of this series via Kindle, that concerns me a bit.    I think on the whole the illustrations aren't a huge issue and so I'd probably take off half a point, but Amazon does not allow half-star values in rating books. Therefore, I gave four stars because I didn't think it was right to give five when I thought there was a negative that bore mention. I don't want any potential Kindle reader to get put off by my comments about the illustrations. It's still well worth the read, and it's beyond dispute that reading a 1000+ page hardback is a lot easier when you read it as an e-book compared to hauling a hardback around everywhere you go. (I was so absorbed in this story that I've been taking my Kindle with me to Washington Capitals games so that I can read during intermission and between warmups and the start of the game. I would not have taken a 1000-page book to a hockey game!)
B004856SQ8|5.0|I missed most of the 80s living in Italy. My wife is trying to correct that by making me watch shows, listen to music and trying to explain Flock of Seagull hair to me.<br />So I've watched exactly one season of the A-Team. She said the rest of the episodes were pretty much the same thing. BA didn't want to fly, Face flirted, Murdock was nuts and Hannibal loved it when a plan came together, lots of bullets, very few deaths.<br />The movie followed the theme of the tv show perfectly. There was a bare thread of a plot that worked just well enough to give everyone a chance to fight, shoot, plan and flirt. It was just as funny as the original tv show. More intentionally funny, although the part that had my teenager in stitches was Liam Neeson's accent slipping in and out.
B004HAG40O|4.0|It took this album to make me admit I haven't loved The Decemberists more recent work as much as I would have liked. For all the great moments on The Hazards of Love and The Crane Wife (and there are many), there were also copious amounts of convolution and sort of awkward prog rock (see: The Island/...). The result was never strong enough to rob The Decemberists of their title as my favorite band, it just left me feeling like I should still be loving them more.     One listen of The King is Dead is all it took for me to remember why I still love this band, and it took none of the effort I had to invest in their bigger albums. The Decemberists, to me, don't write pretty music or clever lyrics as much as they conjure up a portal to somewhere far more romantic and beautifully tragic. Songs like Grace Cathedral Hill or On The Bus Mall still never fail to pull me into their worlds. This time around, things are far simpler than they ever have been, but the effect is similar. There are no long songs, nothing that will require 15 minutes of focus and a dictionary to figure out, nothing set in the late 1800s, and no tragically doomed romance. The result is a beautifully coherent album that may not pull you out of reality like their past works, but it will wrap this world in a gauzy glow for the sublime 40 minutes it sticks around.     I'm once again very excited to see where they go from here, but so grateful to have this in the meantime.     4.5/5
B002ZG9774|5.0|I loved this movie. Yes, I'm a Christina Aguilera fan and have been for a decade now, but I've always been particularly excited to see her in her acting debut, as I've always known she'd be amazing. When the movie opens up to Christina, or Ali, at her job in Iowa, and she immediately starts out belting the Etta James classic, 'Somethings Gotta Hold On Me' after the diner she's managing closes for the evening, I got the feeling right away that this would be a feel good movie. Having been a long-time Aguilera fan, seeing her in concert four times since 1999, it takes a lot from her to keep impressing me more and more. Within the first 10 minutes of Burlesque, I was highly impressed with Aguilera's acting chops. Far far better than anything her peers or even her elders could ever pull off, especially in their acting debuts. Christina's career now seems to be just starting off, having been reinvigorated by this movie and the promotional performances surrounding it. Cher - the legendary, one and only Cher - amazing. I have to admit I was not too familiar with some of her work from early on in her career, but in this movie I was most impressed by the fact that this woman A) doesn't age, B) still has the talent she did when she started out, but it's gotten better, and c)the voice - she is a powerhouse and always has been!     If you're not a fan of Cher or Ag, you may not like this movie since it's centered around them. But, if anything, see it for that hot shot of Cam Gigandet's fine ass!
6305311463|5.0|I watched this so many times, and love the movie. Michael Bay is an awesome director, and Love the movie he did about an astroid coming to Earth. What is with meteors with this guy, he did this, and Transformers, still meteors crashing on Earth. He has an grudge against the Earth... not... just kidding. Couldn't resist it.
1594202842|5.0|Having raised two daughters who graduated from college, then received masters degrees and now have professional jobs in New York City, I was very interested to hear Amy Chua's ideas about child rearing.  She would be the first to admit she was \\"over the top\\" Some of her remarks have been extremely controversial, but seem more \\"tongue in cheek\\" than anything else and intended to be humorous and self-deprecating. Certainly, we have to recognize that extreme parenting can back fire and every child is different. Her younger daughter, Lulu, taught her as much!  Nevertheless, there are important lessons here. What's important here is that 1) parental involvement and 2) control are the two crucial factors in helping your child achieve academically.  Parental involvement and control takes work and intense emotional commitment on the part of the parents, a price too many parents are unwilling to pay. In many families I know, parents have minimal involvement with their children, allow them to spend inordinate amounts of time watching TV, surfing the NET, or on Facebook, rather than tending to their academics.  Too many parents I know believe that controlling their children's time and activities is a lost cause, given all the other noxious influences in their life, and that too impose demands on their performance only \\"hurts their self esteem.\\"  Certainly, Amy's viewpoint is common to immigrant families who believe that their success in America will not come as a gift, or because they have \\"connections\\", but will only come with hard work and achievement. Immigrant parents believe their mission is to be \\"tiger parents\\" - to do what is necessary to help their children succeed as adults in a very competitive and sometimes, unforgiving world.
B004HAG40O|5.0|The King is Dead is a huge shift from the Rock Opera complexity of the Decemberists  previous  \\"Hazards of Love\\" album.  My favorite song in the King is Dead is the straightforward ballad \\"January Hymn\\" which begins  \\"On a winter Sunday I go,  To clear away the snow, And green the ground below\\" and drifts softly to memories of a lost love. \\"June Hymn\\"  has a similar seasonal theme and feel.  Both \\"Calamity Song\\" and \\"Down by the River\\" are knowing tributes to REM and most of the the songs have a country-folk feel.  The Decemberists are joined by REM's Peter Buck and country songstress Gillian Welch to provide a wonderful cross pollination.  While the album follows an intentionally stripped down Americana style compared to the Decemberists previous British folk influenced albums the lyrics continue with their trademark literary complexity.  For example in Calamitity Song one playful line is \\"The year of the chewable Ambien tab.\\" which Meloy stated in an interview \\"doesn't mean anything\\" or of course perhaps it does. As allways for the Decemberists the ironic and playful lyrics are a great part of the enjoyment along with their great musicality. I am enjoying the new direction though still a classic Decemberists thematic approach.

B00008YJBL|5.0|Of all my Cash albums,this is my favorite. Johnny Cash lived more in his lifetime than most of us will ever know.However;he could see the day coming where he would leave this life and because of his great faith;he was ready to go to his reward.He did not have an easy ending ;losing June so suddenly,and he probably had enough of sering and health problems.<br /> After all the years of success and such a huge following of fans who loved him;he decided to put all his feelings into this set of songs ;and probably knew it would be the last thing he would leave for his friends and family.<br /> Of all the songs he could have chosen ,he chose songs that conveyed immense feeling.What I found most surprising about this album is that if I were to pick the songs that he would put on the album;I not sure I would have picked any of them.That is not to say that I disagree with his choices;what he picked was unbelievably appropriate.As he sings each song,it sounds he is putting every last bit of strenth and feeling into that song.One just have to wonder if he ever thought he would finish each song,let alone all of them.The video\\"Hurt\\"that comes with the set is also extremely moving.<br /> Anyone who followed Johnny Cash's career and loved him and his music will surely want  and enjoy this,his farewell album.

I mention this because the eagle-eyed fan will notice that there are 3 B-sides NOT featured here (and there was room for them) - they're on the superlative \\"Music From The North Country\\" American Recordings 2CD/1DVD compilation from 2009.

Tracks like \\"Blue\\" and \\"Two Hearts\\" were standouts anyway on the original CD, but here they sound just gorgeous. The remaster also makes you rehear a lot of the lesser-lauded gems on the record like \\"Pray For Me\\" (with Victoria Williams on Backing Vocals - lyrics above) and the pretty \\"Ann Jane\\" - they now sound 'so' good.<br /><br />As you can imagine - the previously unreleased stuff is a mixture of the great and the ordinary. The 2 B-sides on Disc 1 are only OK, but the 3 outtakes are surprisingly good - especially \\"Sweet Hobo Self\\". The plaintive \\"You And I (Ba Ba Ba)\\" could have been a great lost classic - it starts out so well, but then seems to get lost in a lyrical mess that the band forgot to come back to - to sort out.<br /><br />Disc 2 offers up a whopping 18 demo versions. With so many songs recording in one gulp - and being demos - mistakes and glitches are left in and the production is basic (a lot of hiss on the Oct 1992 sessions) - but it actually imbibes the songs that didn't make the final cut like \\"Won't Be Coming Home\\" and \\"Poor Michael's Boat\\" with a stripped down intimacy that will thrill hardcore fans.  The \\"Blue From Now On\\" demo for instance is as gorgeous in rough-cut as is the finished version (eventually just called \\"Blue\\"). Some are dull though like \\"Red's Song\\" and \\"Bloody Hands\\" - some surprise you like the excellent \\"Ranch House In Phoenix\\" while \\"Nothing Left To Borrow\\" is as lovely as The Jayhawks get. While it's not quite the wow the Deluxe Edition of Whiskeytown's \\"Strangers Almanac\\" is (see separate review) - it's still very good indeed.<br /><br />To sum up - the remaster is superlative, the packaging is excellent and the 'works-in-progress' extras give us a 'deeper' feel for the album and are often shockingly good.<br /><br />Recommended.on of Whiskeytown's \\"Strangers Almanac\\" is (see separate review) - it's still very good indeed.

B001AQT11M|5.0|I received this movie faster than expected.  This is one of my all time favorites and my 2 yr old niece loves it as well.
B004856SQ8|5.0|The movie is a must watch. It has the action, comedy and a little bit of romance. I have seen this movie several times and it still makes me laugh.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This movie is an inspiration, a reminder that there's nothing to stop one from becoming the best version of oneself. If you are at a point of your life when you are down, watch it and you to see that you can do anything if you believe.    The story is about a reluctant king, who wasn't suppose to become one, but in the end carried his burden with dignity. Duke of York, known for his terrible stammer and a timid personality, was supposed to remain in the shadow of his older brother and raise two beautiful daughters with his beloved  wife but faith had a different path for him.  Shortly after he becomes King George VI upon the abdication of his brother. He has to give a speech to announce to his people that the nation is going to war with Hitler. It's a real challenge. He had already gone through countless sessions of therapy in the past to help him overcome his stammering to no avail. Until a very different man appears in his life, someone who not only becomes his greatest teacher and servant, but also his best friend...    What an excellent tribute to the strength of human spirit!
1401324029|4.0|This is an attempt by ABC to capitalize on the popular Castle TV series.  Richard Castle is shown as the author, and it may be presumed that this is a psuedonym for the writers of the TV show.  ABC Studios is shown as the copyright holder.  The main characters are NYPD homicide detective Nikki Heat and, for the novel, the writer Jameson Rook.  It is a combination of a murder mystery and an account of their love life.  The plot drags a bit at some points and, perhaps, has a few too many sub-plots.  The action, at points, starts to lean towards Keystone Kops with a stolen corpse, etc.  Overall, it is an interesting read that will draw you into the later part of the plot as situations develop.  It is not a page turner, and is not award winning literature.  It is more of an average mystery that you will finish reading (as opposed to some that I never did finish).

0385341679|5.0|I received the book on Saturday, and am currently starting it again for a MUCH SLOWER reread...<br /><br />Shadowfever does answer a lot of the questions readers have had through out the series. There is only one question that wasn't answered, that sticks out in my mind, but because of the circumstances surrounding the question and answer - and Mac's acceptance of the fact she may never know and no longer NEEDS to - I don't feel I need an answer either. Vague much? Yes, but the Q&A is too spoilery.<br /><br />And there is one thing I will strongly caution all the reader's against: DO NOT SKIM THE BOOK. DO NOT GO LOOKING FOR ANSWERS AHEAD. If you must, go ahead and read the last page (front and back), you'll get enough of an answer to one question to keep you satisfied not to seek answers to the rest.<br /><br />The way KMM has written this last book, with each turn of the page - the theories that we've all come up with are constantly challenged and evolving and half the fun is trying to figure it all out before it's finally revealed.<br /><br />And KMM has written and woven another magical Fever novel. And it does bring up new questions, which will probably be explored in the spin-off series... But the questions that pertain to Mac and Barrons and V'lane? The three main leads in this series? Those are the answers we get.<br /><br />I thought this book was a bittersweet end to a much loved series. Steamy, erotic, dark, emotional, torturous, gripping, fantastical... A rollercoaster ride. One I'm already looking forward to revisiting after only finishing it three days ago.<br /><br />Two thumbs way up, KMM!
0810997827|5.0|My oldest asked for this for Christmas and he is the type to prefer video games to books, so of course I had to get it for him. The books, which are now spawning movies, are cute and funny. Nothing too complicated and my kids love the comic illustrations. Good buy considering they go for about $60 at the local bookstore.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Having heard little bits of Hawaiian-born American singer Bruno Mars here and there on Youtube (enough to remember him), I saw this in the supermarket today and took a gamble on it. Glad I did! ... It's not my usual thing (I'm more into Ska, Rock and Indie), but I took an instant warm to \\"Doo-Wops and Hooligans\\".     I suppose, given his LA/Hawaii roots, his musical style is somewhat understandable: from the first track, my room filled with an uplifting (and stylish) mixture of breezy, summery pop (lightly influenced by cool, urban reggae -- though it's more pop than anything). Bruno's soft (lightly falsetto) voice is perfectly matched with his cool-beats and Caribbean-toned music. It feels like you should be listening to this on a hammock with a glass of coconut juice and crashing waves beside you ))     The songs are a blissful mixture of sunny romantic ballads and lazy chillout tracks. Personal highlights, are the addictive opener \\"Grenade\\" the appropriately titled (and infectiously inspirational) toe-tapper \\"The Lazy Song\\" (\\"Today I don't feel like doing any-thing...\\") and the moving \\"Count on Me\\". That said, though, there isn't any really any filler on the album: due to the style it's just perfect for kicking off your shoes and lying down with a of cuppa ))! My only (\\"slight\\") niggle, is that track 2 \\"Just The Way You Are\\" sounds very similar to Alicia Keys \\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\" (Element of Freedom). So close as to be little more than a complete rip-off!....(Search out the mashables online, they fit almost perfectly!)     Quibble aside you can't really go wrong with this album. If you like lazy, chilled-out, uplifting music go out and get it -- it's the perfect tonic for all those blue, wintry days.
0525423273|5.0|I just LOVED this book. It was one of those fun reads that you totally get lost in the characters and the relationships and the setting. I couldn't put it down (literally read it in like 2 sittings). I have recommended it to all my friends with the warning that they WILL fall in love with Etienne so their boyfriends/husbands might get a teensy bit jealous. The worst part of this book was that sadly it came to an end. I have Stephanie Perkins next book waiting on my wish list and will no doubt be pre-ordering it as soon as it's available. THis is a book that I will turn to when I want a good YA romance read that I know won't let me down :)
B00192IV9U|5.0|All ten tracks are the best. I love this record so much that I repeat the entire album. The songs on this CD needs to be on the Billboard top ten singles. I love to dance to the entire CD.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I ordered the wide screen version and it only plays on one DVD player, not the one we take when we travel, which is what I had wanted. It was a disappointment. So, be very careful which view you order. I didn't really know there was a difference.
1400034205|5.0|It is no wonder that many of Maugham's books have been made into movies (The Painted Veil, The Razor's Edge -twice-, Of Human Bondage). His writing is impressive and delicate at the same time. I love reading the old fashioned words of that era; however, the words still lay out a most powerful story in each case. This book is one of the most important books addressing PTSD than any other I have read. A great and important book.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I watched Rome when it first aired on the BBC in 2005 and thought it was amazing. It's been 5 years, now, and I saw it was fairly cheap on Amazon so got it for Christmas. It's only 3 days later and I've already seen most of the first series!     The thing that stands out this time around is just how good Rome was. The fall of the Roman Republic is quite possibly the most tumultuous period in Political history so the writers were always onto a winner when writing a big-budget drama. Watching the drama and violence may seem over-the-top, but practically all the major events and murders depicted here happened. In fact, if anything, despite this being one of the most violent and perverse mainstream dramas broadcast, the writers have shied away from the darker and more indulgent aspects of ancient Rome -- Mark Anthony, for instance, had several gay (as well as countless heterosexual) affairs and used to attend wild parties dressed as a god, in a chariot pulled by lions! (Anthony here, played superbly by James Purefoy, is still outrageous by modern standards, but surely the reality would have been too much to stomach for the BBC).     Where the writers succeed, though, is meshing this story onto strong, utterly-compelling character-driven plotting set within a landscape so fantastically realised that practically every shot takes your breath away. The day-to-day dirty, violent, horny reality of life in ancient cities has surely never been more accurately and beautifully portrayed. The streets of Rome are alive before your eyes, and the characters whose lives you follow through them are equally captivating (the hilarious and brutal story of unlikely friends, Centurion Lucius Vorenus and legionarie Titus Pullo; the family drama of high-society Atia and her children Ovtavia and Octavian (the future emperor Augustus); the political and military careers, the lives and loves of Anthony and Caesar; and supporting plots concerning the plotting against Caesar, the working conditions of Rome, the pagan religions and sacrifices, not to mention the careers and demises of Cato, Cicero and Brutus). As I say, the writers already had writing gold before they even put fingers to keyboard, but the effort they have put in to covering so many of Rome's facets, to also create memorising and loveable characters, has to be lauded as one of the best written dramas of our age.     Rome does have its faults (some historical inaccuracies and -- largely due to the events covered in series one being so powerful -- the second season isn't quite as strong), but there is nothing else like it (if you have been put off watching this from seeing the Tudors, give it a go, I think you will be surprised by the difference). I think I enjoyed Rome more second time around. I guess because it has been and gone and nothing has come close to matching it for sheer extravagance, debauchery and spectacle. I can't wait to watch it on Blue-Ray )     If (as I) you are interested in reading more about Caesar and Rome after viewing this, I'd recommend Rubicon: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic (which covers the same period as season one) and Caesar: The Life of a Colossus (which is a comprehensive biography of Caesar, and covers his early life and military career in Gaul as well as events after the Rubicon).
030746363X|1.0|This book fires on all the typical fitness industry cylinders. It promises you the world and is essentially nonsense. Not to say there aren't certain things that are true but primarily this methodology will not contribute to long term fitness gains and weight losses. Slickly written trash.

I wanted to slim up and gain some muscle,  I have been following the diet for 17 days now and have lost 15 lbs.  If you are looking to get into shape, lost weight, or gain mass, this is the book to read.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a gripping read. It's a story fueled by morally gray decisions based on survial. Primal instinct is brought to the forefront but not without the heartbreaking sacrifices characters must make in the end. The plot remains simple throughout yet tightens towards the fantastic climax leaving you riveted.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|If I could have avoided all of the hype that's been buzzing about over Black Swan, I would have. It's just that with this film being up for so many awards, it's been absolutely impossible to avoid all of the people gushing \\"this movie is so awesome- Portman is amazing!\\" Unfortunately this just didn't fully live up to the hype for me.<br /><br />The movie's story is a good one, with Portman playing a beautiful & talented ballerina who may or may not be getting harassed by a more talented peer. When the suspense does kick in, it's a very good film. However, for every good moment of suspense there's just as many where not much really happens & I sort of sat around waiting for anything, something to occur to help move the plot along. Portman does do a wonderful job with the film & when the movie hits its high notes it's a very well done film. It's just that there's too many moments where nothing happens & the film just gets a little repetitive at times. The movie is almost 2 hours long but felt more like 3, but not in a good way.<br /><br />I do have to say one thing about the film- the ending is incredibly well done & is truly the highlight of the movie. I just wish that it didn't feel like it took so long to get to it. The choreography is also something to be admired & like I said above, when the movie gets into it's groove the suspense & tragedy really does hit you pretty hard. I also have to admire Winona Ryder's role in this film- she plays a ballerina past her prime that loses everything to Portman's character & she does an awesome job of it.<br /><br />Maybe it's all of the hype that ruined the experience for me- I just kept expecting it to be this amazing experience & perhaps later on down the road I'll have a better time rewatching it. For now, though I have to say that this film will really only be appreciated by a certain group of people. Those who are going in hopes of it being some high tension film or a movie where something happens all the time will be highly disappointed.
0312370849|5.0|Absorbing story about a Jewish girl, Sarah, and her family who were victimized in Vichy France in 1942 -- which is interleaved with that of a journalist, Julia, who learns about Sarah 60 years later while researching the events at the Velodrome D'Hiver on the anniversary.  Connections between the two families come to light, and the impact of the original little girl Sarah becomes much larger.  Strong, appealing characters combine with an informative story about the (historically) less-publicized persecution of Jews in France, as well as the family challenges of the journalist who takes such a personal interest.  Didn't want the book to end.

1582701709|4.0|Some people will go back to normal life after watching the movie or reading the book.  Some say it's too hard to live with Passion and Motivation.  Yes many times in life that is true.      But at all times, simply saying \\"Thank You\\" to the universe, your God, your family, your friends, just for the simple things in life is easy to do and gives unimagined rewards.      I believe The Secret has opened so many lives to a new way of thinking about what it is in life we each want.  And with simply thinking about what we want, the best life will manifest itself.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|David Fincher has a knack for seedy underbellies, and he finds a juicy one to stab in \\"The Social Network.\\" Working from a wordy script from Aaron Sorkin and a bravura performance from Jesse Eisenberg (as Mark Zuckerberg), he boils the creation of the most successful internet site down to friendship, betrayal and insecurity, with side servings of jealousy and greed. It's the same old story you've heard a million times before, just updated for the 21'st century.<br /><br />Eisenberg shows the kind of detached brilliance of the uber-nerd stereotype, and he makes Zuckerberg into a believably arrogant genius. His zingers are cruelly on target, even though many of them are delivered at deserving targets. (It also is worth noting that had these things been said in an actual legal deposition, the speaker would have been escorted away.) However, you see essentially a hurt young man whose brilliance doesn't impress many folks because he is an overbearing ween. This fact is set up in the brutally dark comedic exchange at the movie's opening, where Zuckerberg is trying to score points with a girl, all the while continually berating her. One drunken revenge hacking later, and the seeds of Facebook are planted.<br /><br />But it is that isolated anger that fuels \\"The Social Network.\\" When the spoiled rich Winklevoss twins (played with a bit of trickery by one Armie Hammer) are trying to sue on the grounds of intellectual theft, Zuckerberg snaps at the lawyer representing them that his thoughts are \\"back at the offices of Facebook, where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing.\\" Then to drive his irritation at the attorney home, he sneers \\"Did I adequately answer your condescending question?\\"<br /><br />There are snakes all over this grassy web, all trying to get to Zuckerberg's money, and at the same time, Zuckerberg stabs one of the only people to show him kindness, his co-founder (Andrew Garfield) Eduardo Saverin. It's hard to comprehend Zuckerberg's reasoning for trying to jam his one friend out of the business, although the snake oil spewed by Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake, who seems to be playing himself) seems a likely explanation. The way these three triangulate forms the emotional core of the film, with Parker playing demonic mischief maker, trying to grease his way into a spotlight that he envies Eduardo for having. The rapid-fire back and forth between all these spokes still centralize back on Zuckerberg, and \\"The Social Network\\" turns on how much you either believe the story or how much you can tolerate two hours of listening to these wealthy but morally bereft children spearing each other.rfield) Eduardo Saverin.

B001AQO400|1.0|I am generally a Bill Murray fan, but this movie was not up to par with what I've come to expect from him.  I tried to give the film a chance and watch it from start to finish but I kept drifting off to sleep.  It was slow and I don't like to use the word boring, but it was boring. Don't waste your time with this Bill Murray flick, go watch Groundhog Day again.

B002ZG999U|4.0|I bought this for the boy for a stocking stuffer-- I usually don't go for the macho, Stallone, action-type movie.  Finding out it was actually WRITTEN by Stalone, I thought, \\"Oh, this should be price.\\"  I was suprisingly surprised!  =p  The plot line was pretty good and kept me interested throughout-- not just a bunch of macho gumbas punching each other and shooting guns (I mean, there was plenty of that, but it was \\"tasteful.\\")-- the fighting scenes/special effects were interesting and unique, and the love-story-that-never-was kept both me and the boy interested.  The cameos worked and were not cheesy. Surprisingly, I give this movie an enthusiastic thumbs up! :)
B0041KKYEM|4.0|In the first half of this film I felt like I was locked in a room with the air being slowly drawn out.  It's hard to take.  You feel sorry for Nina (played perfectly by Portman), the talented ballerina who's trapped in a situation and buffeted by too many strong forces for her young life.  She is fanatical about ballet and perfects herself to the point of neurosis. Her mother (Hershey), whom she lives with, is smothering and over-controlling.  Her fellow ballerinas are jealous and bitchy, and she has an arrogant, predatory director who hits on his young female employees and who's constantly harping on her to be loosen up (he calls her frigid in front of a male dancer), be more sexual and less cautious.  I'm thinking all the time how Nina's life seems trapped in a box surrounded by all these pushy jerks, which makes me feel trapped as well.<br /><br />A \\"bad girl\\" (Lily; who's quite the hottie, very flirtatious & takes drugs) comes strolling into the company and befriends Nina, but you don't know if she's doing it to help her or to manipulate her.<br /><br />Nina gets the nod to play the Swan in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, while Lily is the understudy.  Nina is a natural for the \\"White Swan\\" role but she appears too inexperienced and tentative to play the seductive \\"Black Swan\\".  More tension is added when you think that Lily is having a sexual affair with the director Tomas (played with European arrogance and flair by Vincent Cassel), to influence him to give her the role of the Swan, instead of Nina.  All throughout the movie you're wondering if Nina can pull off the \\"Black\\" role whilst under this incredible pressure and personal conflict.<br /><br />< Spoilers Below ><br />The kicker is that Portman's character starts becoming (more) psychotic and you don't know in any given scene if she's hallucinating or it's real.  The hallucinogenic scenes start becoming more intense after Lily takes Nina out on the town and slips some drug into her drink, which makes you question Lily's motives in befriending Nina.  These scenes of psychosis/hallucination involve her mutilating her hands, watching an aging ballerina stabbing herself, experiencing a very realistic lesbian sex scene, and the final traumatic scene.  I think that the film over-does the hallucinations, but it certainly adds loads of suspense to the second half, leading up to the shocker of the finale, which I won't disclose.  The shock of the last scene coincides with the climax of the Tchaikovsky ballet & music (and crowd), which really pumps the viewer up emotionally.  The finale is nicely done!<br /><br />HOWEVER, after it's all done, you wonder what message was conveyed.  The protagonist has MANY things that are strongly needed by American teens today:  she's disciplined, has a work ethic, a close relationship with her mother, she's doesn't do casual sex and and no drugs or alcohol.  The movie, to teenage girls (or anybody) conveys the message that people like that (\\"good girls\\") are messed up.  So she's portrayed as being psychotic.  Her \\"bad girl\\" opposite sleeps around (probably with her Boss), uses sex to get what she wants & takes drugs.  She's portrayed as the \\"cool\\" one, the mentally stable, confident girl.  IN REALITY, the sleep-around girl will get STDs and/or get drug addicted or other such societal diseases (think Linsey Lohan).  Also in reality, the cool director who hits on ballerinas is going to get sued big time. Also IN REALITY, most women who are disciplined, talented, and close to their parents will do much better at work and life.<br /><br />But it's the \\"good\\" girl who is portrayed as going waaaay to far the other way in this film.  MESSAGE:  \\"Only the good die young!  Loosen up and be a hedonist!  Sleep around, sleep with your Boss, and don't get hung up!\\"  So the message is hard to swallow.<br /><br />In summary, I liked the emotional kick that \\"Black Swan\\" gave me, it's a suspensful story, but with a message that I don't like.  Is it Oscar material?I think that Portman and Cassel should be considered for Oscars, but the movie relies too much on hallucinations and shock scenes to win Best Picture.
B002ZG980U|4.0|I give it only 4 stars because of the sheer craft, the special effects and outstanding use of sound effects and a brilliant music soundtrack all contribute to a terrific experience for the audience. I dock a star from it because Nolan could have done so much more with the great comic actors he had at his disposal (Caine, Page, Gordon-Leavitt - remember him in \\"3rd Rock from the Sun?). I know, I know, we shouldn't criticize what he didn't do, but Nolan might have had a Best Picture Oscar for this one (hey, it still might win!) had there been better use of his resources from the character perspective.<br /><br />I've only seen this on DVD, not Blu-Ray, only because I didn't have a player when this came out. Now that I do, I plan to get the BD version - anyone want a slightly used DVD?
031603438X|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my husband.  He started reading it Christmas morning and mentioned several times what an amazing book it was.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Ok, it has been 21 years since I first screened Miller's Crossing, and one of the ways that I judge films(or music or literature, for that matter) is how they stand up to the test of time. It's as good today as it was 21 years ago: it is a flawless gem of a film. When I first saw it, it was obvious that they had borrowed, or alluded to, a great deal of the plot framework of Dashiell Hammett's great novel the Glass Key. At first, this sort of bugged me. But then, after looking at the differences between the two stories, it gradually became apparent to me that they had identified certain weaknesses (at least in terms of cinematic representation of the work) and set about to refashion the lump of clay to eliminate them. The end result still gets into the insider's sophisticated amoral view of politics and organized crime during Prohibition--which was the great strength of The Glass Key--while telling a more complex and believable storyline between the characters. This is a sophisticated proposition. In both the film and the book, the man who stands behind the great chair(Mr Inside-Outski) and whispers in the ear of the Great Man is a gambler having a string of bad luck, who usually knows how to play all the angles. There is a woman whom the gambler thinks is dangerous for the Great Man--and the Great Man will not listen. There is a rival with psycho overtones--who orders the beating of said gambler. There is a falling out between the gambler and the Political Boss, and a great trap that is laid by the gambler without the Bosses knowledge or comprehension, to deal with all these complications once and for all. Beyond those comparisons, Miller's Crossing serves up some scenes that are so memorable, so poetic, that they are simply breathtaking. A small boy stands staring at a corpse in an alley. After a long pause, he grabs the toupee off the corpse and runs away. Later, the Political Boss says: \\"They took his hair, Tommy.  Jesus that's strange. Why would they do that?\\" Then, there is the Political Boss, teeth clamped to a cigar, standing in his slippers in the dark, firing a steady stream of light from a Tommy Gun at a fleeing car to the strains of Danny Boy playing on an old Victrola. There is a young John Turturro, being led through the woods to his own execution, begging and pleading for his life. \\"Look in your heart, Tommy! Look in your heart!. We're not like those animals back there! We don't bump guys!\\"    It's a film that tells a story in a very cinematic way, driving the viewer forward relentlessly, and the complexities build towards a surprising and inexorable conclusion. In short, it uses the full power of film to take the user through a labyrinth of red herrings, false starts, subterfuges, illusions and complications before the truth is laid bare like a fillet of sole.\\"I never say I told you so, and I don't like people who do.\\" This is a great, great film.  Just remember, I told you so.

B000H1QYXY|5.0|A wonderful overview of a brillant career. This album has all the major hits except one. A highly enjoyable product.
B004EE30DW|3.0|That this album sounds a bit different from the last few Decemberists albums is only to be expected. Colin Meloy has stated explicitly that this album takes some of its inspiration from the band R.E.M, with R.E.M band member Peter Buck guesting on three tracks. As a change in direction, I was, I'll admit, a bit skeptical of an R.E.M infused Decemberists album; I didn't see that mix coming at all. But change is not necessarily bad change, and I have to this moment been a  loyal fan, so I got this album today as it came out and dutifully listened to it front to back. While there are a few standout tracks on this album, I couldn't help but feel a bit let down. Much of what made the Decemberists so unique, the tone and feel, the epic stories as per \\"Mariner's Revenge Song\\" or \\"the Crane Wife\\" the clever lyrics and song structure, have been intentionally stripped down. What is left is a set of pared down, and to my ears, fairly standard songs. Not bad, but not what I've come to expect from the Decemberists, a band whose every album up to now I have loved.     If the Decemberists have excelled at anything, it is creating a world for their songs to occupy. Listening to their first three albums, the real strength was in the relation of the music to the lyrics. \\"Legionnaire's Lament\\" did a wonderful job of conjuring up images of a dejected French foreign legionnaire stranded in the desert longing for his home. \\"On the Bus Mall\\" similarly brought to mind the teenage runaways of the song's lyrics. The beauty of these songs was the images and feelings they could conjure. On \\"The King is Dead\\" I struggle to think of an example of a song that quite is able to conjure up images like those previous albums. Songs like \\"Don't Carry It All\\" and \\"Calamity Song\\" sound so ordinary in comparison to what was practically musical storytelling in earlier albums. Another element that I loved so much in older Decemberists albums was the feel. Even when they contained upbeat songs, the feel of their earlier albums was undeniably darker: some songs overtly so, but even their most upbeat songs, \\"July, July\\" and \\"16 Military Wives\\", had lyrics at least hinting at something deeper and unsettling at the heart of the music. That tone is almost lacking entirely from this album. Perhaps some may be fine with that. I lament the loss of what was I think relatively deep music.    Luckily, there were a few choice cuts that really rose above the rest of the album. \\"Rise to Me\\", \\"January Hymn\\" and \\"June Hymn\\" are all great ballads in classic Decemberists style, the successors, perhaps, to \\"Right Red Ankle\\". Chris Funk adds some excellent steel pedal guitar flourishes on \\"Rise to Me\\". \\"This is Why We Fight\\", the closest thing the album has to a real burner, is also excellent, and a showcase for Meloy's guitar work, which I did not know was as good as it is. The album closer \\"Dear Avery\\" is in my mind easily the strongest track, recalling the best the Decemberists have to offer. On the strength of those five songs I can say that this purchase was not a waste for me.    \\"Hazards of Love\\" was itself a major change in direction for the Decemberists, and a polarizing album for Decemberists fans, so I have chosen not to reference it in this review. I will, however, draw comparisons to to the core collection of Decemberists albums that really represented their style until very recently: \\"Castaways and Cutouts\\", \\"Her Majesty\\", \\"Picaresque\\" and \\"The Crane Wife\\". Despite the strength of a few great tracks on \\"The King Is Dead\\", I can't but say that each of those albums is superior. Some who were put off by the change of tone in \\"The Hazards of Love\\" (I'll say that I loved it, actually) expected this to be a return to form for the Decemberists. Rather, it is yet another direction, but this time, a less unique and, I can't help feeling, a less emotionally powerful one.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I am 6 weeks pregnant with my sixth child and was looking for something different, something a bit more active with a great routine for strengthening muscles and good cardio, appropriate for pregnancy. I have been using Jillian Michaels workouts sporadically at home over the last year, so I haven't been completely sedentary, but sporadic enough that my endurance isn't very good.    I found this DVD to be appropriately (for pregnancy) challenging and fun. She does move quickly through the moves sometimes, but if you just modify it and work at YOUR pace, stick with the double-time reps when she moves to singles, etc., I think a beginner could do this workout just fine. As your endurance and strength increase, and as you become familiar with the moves and routine, you will feel stronger and your pregnant body will be toned and ready for delivery. I am using the DVD in this way - to build up my muscle strength and endurance while I'm still in early pregnancy, and then to give me a good workout throughout my pregnancy. I did this workout for the first time this morning, and now, an hour later, my obliques and abs (upper abs, under the ribs - sorry I don't know the technical term) and quads are tight and I can tell I got a good workout. The music is a little hokey, but I didn't notice it much. She has a great personality, great knowledge of fitness, good posture, etc. She is a lot of fun.    The partner workout looks like it would be fun. She uses her husband to add resistance to wall push-ups and other strength moves. It could be a fun way for you and your husband/partner to do something together. It seems designed to give an opportunity to work out/spend time with your partner or a friend, and by increasing the difficulty of the strength moves, it thereby increases your muscle strength and muscle tone.     I haven't looked at the post-natal workout, but I am optimistic it will be just as great as this one.  Great DVD, great buy!
B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|Coming from a Kanye West hater,I purchased the album during the $3.99 sale and I felt sick with cheapness as if I had stolen this album.<br />It's good ,in fact it nearly perfect , I will never like Kanye the person but I will surely buy his next album at full price.
B001EN71CW|5.0|If you don't believe me go rent it and decide for yourself.  Not alot of modern storytellers have the talent of Joss Whedon.  I was never a buffy fan but I the guy delivers.  WHEN WILL THEY MAKE MORE!!!!!!
B004856SQ8|5.0|It turned out to be good. Loads of fun, action and good actors' set. This movie is what 'the A-team'really should be like. It was a pleasure watching it. I'm hoping they would continue with the 'A- team' and bring something else in another year to come.
1608870081|5.0|Folks, seriously, this is wonderful. I couldn't help jumping up and down every time I turned a page. I'm a massive Harry Potter nerd and this book, although I'm fonder of the book series rather than the movies, is simply wonderful. Pop-up scenes are GREAT, no other word to describe them, and the props and replicas are fantastic. Definitely my best purchase so far.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I can't say how much I love this headset.  It's wonderful to not have all of the extra wires laying about that my cats can chew on....The sound quality is great, and the voice morphing is a lot of fun to mess around with.  There aren't many G-Keys, but I didn't really care about that.  In all honesty, it's a headset.  I didn't see the point in having it bogged down with a ton of g-keys.  There are now 5 people in my gaming guild with this headset, or the wired version, and everyone sounds crystal clear over Ventrilo.<br /><br />All of that being said, there was an issue with my wireless internet and this headset.  Every time I turned it on, my wireless would stop functioning.  It was fixed by changing channels and messing with the settings of the router.  Although....It is now causing problems with the wireless fence that we have for one of our dogs.  I've had to stop using it because it randomly beeps or shocks her even when she is still well inside her containment area.  Hopefully I can find a fix to this as well.<br /><br />All in all, set up is easy and it's a great headset if you want to be able to move through the house while still listening to music or talking to guildies over Ventrilo.
B001VNB54A|4.0|It's ironic that the word for the planet's largest ocean means \\"peaceful\\" when the Pacific theatre of WW2 has become synonymous with probably the bloodiest and most ferocious warfare in human history.<br /><br />Spielberg's 10-episode \\"Pacific\\" miniseries in homage to the servicemen who fought against the Japanese in that enormous theatre of war is inevitably compared to its sister-series, the seminal \\"Band of Brothers\\" - a serious contender for the best-ever TV drama of any genre. \\"Pacific\\" has proved to be more controversial than the almost universally praised BoB for a number of reasons. Here's my take on it.<br /><br />Inspired by Stephen Ambrose's book and with the majority of survivors staying in contact as a cohesive group of veterans who had shared the same experiences in the same unit at the same places and times, BoB was an exceptional opportunity to follow the continuous month-by-month narrative of Easy Company's time in the European theatre. These factors worked in its favor to allow for the realization of a novelistic story developed over 10 hours of TV, diverting only to focus on this or that individual week by week as Easy's campaign took them across Europe in 1944-45. We got to know these men, to care about them and understand them.<br /><br />In contrast, the source material of \\"Pacific\\" comes from the stories of three separate individuals: Medal-of-Honor winner and national hero John Basilone killed at Iwo Jima, and survivors Eugene Sledge and Robert Leckie who both later (much later) wrote best-selling memoirs about their WW2 experiences in the 1st Marine Division. This more ambitious concept makes for a somewhat fractured narrative, especially after episode 3 set in Australia when the stories of Leckie and Basilone diverge. On first viewing the series, it's not easy for the viewer to stay with who everyone is, especially some of the secondary characters, or to care about them. This definitely improves if you view the series a second time but it must be said that the overall concept, direction and editing might have made a slightly better job of this.<br /><br />Another issue is the extreme contrast between episodes focusing on the uncompromisingly violent and horror-filled combat-zones and those which take place in the USA (mainly focusing on Basilone's time there as a medal-winning national hero being used to sell war bonds, falling in love and getting married etc.), Melbourne (the whole of episode 3) and the Pacific R&R base at Pavavu, including Leckie's time in the hospital. I think in truth this works quite well: this is how the Pacific War was conducted and the format illustrates how extreme was the experience these guys went through whilst fighting the island campaign and how it affected them psychologically. We're shown vividly that compared to the taken-for-granted comforts of peacetime life, being in these island battles was like being on another planet, or entering the Gates of Hell, and it was impossible for anyone not there to even begin to understand what it was like. The contrast is extreme, and illustrated well.<br /><br />A point of objection from some is the amount of profanity in the script. The language is realistic and how these guys in that situation talked: however, it might create some parental-child-viewing decision issues. The combat violence is as extreme as we've ever seen on film: heads blown off, limbs blown off, guts ripped out, Japanese soldiers burned alive. The marines, and the audience, get used to this level of carnage very quickly. As Spielberg says of this series:<br /><br />\\"It's brutal, and it's honest, and it's right there in your face - as it was for them.\\"<br /><br />Heated debate has been generated here on amazon and elsewhere over the graphic depiction of \\"atrocities\\" committed by marines in combat situations. Some viewers find this actually offensive, and it puts them off the series. Well, gold teeth WERE removed from the mouths of dead (and not always dead) Japanese soldiers with bayonets and collected by marines: this is attested by Sledge in his memoir, and by other veterans. The reasons why marines eventually behaved this way was because they were forced to witness persistent Japanese Army atrocities on civilians and captured prisoners, and this was not (in my opinion) explored as fully as it might have been. Japanese soldiers would never surrender, or hardly ever. They fought to the death. The Bushido code created a ruthless, murderous, cruel and fanatical enemy who fought with a suicidal ferocity found in no other army in WW2, and to prevail against an enemy like this US servicemen simply were forced to adapt and do likewise. The process which led to this could have been explored with a bit more illustrative detail.<br /><br />The acting is excellent throughout, often understated and subtle. All the three main leads are superb, especially James Badge Dale playing Robert Leckie with irony, intelligence and wit. Again this is more appreciated on second viewing. Even Rami Malek playing \\"SNAFU\\" Shelton who initially comes over as a kind of hard-as-nails psycho type mellows as we get to know him; his character works better on second viewing to reveal him as a bit more complex and nuanced, with a good and caring side, who has learned to cope effectively with the horror of his situation and the continuous loss of friends in his own eccentric way by building a hard shell around himself.<br /><br />Is \\"Pacific\\" the equal of BoB? Wrong question. It's different. BoB has a kind of shining nobility personified by the integrity of Dick Winters, played to perfection by British actor Damian Lewis, which ran like a seam of gold through the series. At the conclusion set in late 1945 in Austria, with Lewis' voiceover relating how the survivors of Easy's campaign returned to civilian life, the audience feels genuine heart-affecting emotion. In contrast, by the conclusion of episode 9 (on Okinawa), \\"Pacific\\" leaves the audience with something of a downer, drained and dispirited with little to mitigate the relentless carnage, the filth, the dismembered and rotting bodies and marines gradually becoming psychologically more unhinged as their buddies are killed off one at a time. Were these sacrifices worthwhile? There's little indication that any of the surviving marines felt they were. The final episode 10, showing the guys returning home in 1946 and rebuilding their lives, is an excellent and valuable bookender to the story and goes some way to mitigate the gloom, but does not succeed completely in doing so. Don't miss it.<br /><br />Worth seeing? You bet. Watch it twice; it's better the second time round when you have absorbed the mood and start to know the characters better. The extras on the Blu-Ray edition, including the \\"enhanced viewing\\" option (consider watching the whole series a second or third time with this facility engaged) are truly excellent. The bios on disc 6 are well worth seeing and bring the real people to life. The musical score is sombre, epic yet understated: near perfection.<br /><br />I'd rate this series about four-and-a-half stars, which is pretty good. It has a lot going for it, but is unlikely to leave you filled with warmth and nobility as did BoB, feeling it was all worthwhile. However if you haven't seen \\"Pacific\\", I'd strongly recommend you do. If you tried to watch it already and abandoned viewing part-way through because of any or all of the reasons explored above, give it another try. This series is a notable achievement with its own special character, and it will likely endure the years well.this is attested by Sledge in his memoir, and by other veterans.

0312370849|5.0|I just finished this book and literally could not put it down.  I could not wait to turn each page and at times felt like I was there, looking on while the jews were being rounded up. I thought of my own family, my children and put myself in the place of Sarah and her family during this terrible time. Its a sad book but I feel sure there are many, many stories such as these.  I like reading a book like this as it shows the strength people have during times like this.

0132350882|5.0|This book nicely describes very good patterns for developing maintainable software in a concise way. Really worth reading. All examples are in Java but any real OO programmer should be able to read and understand it.
1591843162|2.0|Wow! Ok, the first 48 pages are complete crap. I guess he was trying to motivate people, get them riled up. But, really, there is no need for the one-sided represntation of history (Ford) and class warfare histrionics.    The rest of the book has an important message: work fearlessly, with passion. There are some great anecdotes, and some great heading titles, \\"Anxiety is Practicing Failure in Advance\\". But the last 200 pages could have been put into 20 and been more effective. I guess Godin couldn't sell it for $15 then though.    I came here expecting to see a 3 to 3.5 average review. The fact that so many have given this book 5 stars leads me to the question: Just how many sheep are there?

We didn't buy it for awhile because we were worried about the US discs not working on our DVD player here in Australia. But they all work fine, so it was well worth the risk.  Delivery was efficient and came within the timeframe given. Got it in time for christmas.
0312330537|4.0|So this book was written as novel; probably to protect the guilty. It would be interesting to know how much of it is \\"novel\\" and how much is truth.<br /><br />The author's story by itself is incredible, but when you add in all the glimpses he gives into the subcultures of Bombay - the slums, villages, black markets, mafia - it is even better.  He really gives you a feel for India and the people.<br /><br />I'm not sure where he got a lot of the philosophical sayings that were used, but my favorite is, \\"We concentrate our laws, investigations, prosecutions and punishments on how much crime is in the sin, rather than how much sin is in the crime.\\"<br /><br />Don't let the fact that this book is about 1000 pages deter you; it is well written and goes by quickly.
B00006AW2G|5.0|I've bought all the Stones studio albums since Beggars Banquet, pretty much as they were released.  I think this is my favorite.  There is a combination and demonstration of musical styles that makes it more fun to listen to than the others. Even after 40+ years.  The breadth of music here is sort of overlooked now that we have 40-year complilations and personal playlists.  But this is one of the Best Albums Ever. Sex, drugs, and revolution.
0385341679|5.0|Wow, where to begin?  First of all, read all 4 previous books first. Second, take your time, you'll be in for a wild ride.    I think that it's important not to discuss plot points as this whole series has been about solving the mysteries from book one.  For KMM's Fever fans, suffice it to say that all questions are answered, and after having spent quite a lot of time reading the forums out there, we weren't even close (or disappointed, either).    I can only say it was worth the painful wait for Shadowfever, though reading it was exhausting (I couldn't put it down for the nearly 9 hours it took me, and I'm a speed reader).    Happy reading and here's crossing my fingers for KMM's next book(s) to be even half as addictive and entertaining.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|If you're a commentary and stuff like that, then you're better off waiting for this product to go on sale again, cause what you see in the \\"special features\\" sections here, add Music Videos to it and that's it.  Heck, even if you're a fan that doesn't really care about those things, just wait for this product to go on sale again to like $20.  Even if it had LOADS of extras, I can't really justify spending $40 on this, because we all know, come holiday times, it's gonna go on sale.    As for the show itself, I love Castle.  When Season 2 was announced, I jumped. =]  S2 builds on S1 and let the actors and actresses flesh out their characters and background.  So bring on S3, S4, etc!
B001FB55I0|2.0|This is by far the weakest Terminator movie mainly because it is just sloppy and careless. The kids (young Kyle Reese and the young black girl) are the best part of the movie. We are somehow supposed to believe that the machines would build a perfect human based cyborg without some override or control mechanism. We are also supposed to believe that John Connor and the resistance are stupid enough to use the cyborg's heart to save Connor when the cyborg is the perfect mechanism for infiltrating the machines and the only one who can actually fight them. We also are supposed to believe that the humans still are using guns against the machines that cannot damage them. Also why is it that in the obligatory final fight scene that there is only one machine participating when there are thousands of them handy? Then why is it that the machines always toss around our hero instead of just dispatching him? Lastly, why was it necessary to lure Connor to Skynet and to capture Reese in order to kill them when the spiffy cyborg could have easily killed both? I think one notable politician said that you had to \\"suspend disbelief\\". Of course that makes no sense, rather Terminator Salvation invites you to suspend belief. Maybe I will read the book by Alan Dean Foster. Its got to be better than this mess.
B00493AD74|3.0|Not a good or bad movie. I found it a little drawn out. It could have been made a lot shorter and would have been better.
1579128149|5.0|I bought this book for my young teen son, who loves science. He has shared it with his science teacher and I caught my husband looking at it. It has wonderful pictures and is a smaller coffee table sized book. The pages are overall black with bright photos. We originally had the poster made by the same author. My son, saw this and has been coveting it since the day he saw it. Hence, a wonderful gift for him. I haven't read it yet, because I can't quite get it away from him....
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I first stumbled upon Castle a year and a half ago while channel surfing for something to watch at 10pm.  I came upon Castle and instantly loved it (I'm a sucker for crime shows)  The cast is great.  The basic storyline (murder of the week, suspect, etc) has been done to death (CSI, BONES, Law and Order, etc), however to me, it's still very enjoyable and unpredictable.  So naturally, when I saw this on sale for $12, it screamed to me \\"BUY ME!\\"      The acting, writing is good, and the interaction between the characters are good.  It has action, crime, mystery, comedy, and murder all in one.  I'd say it's quite a catch.    I'm not much of a commentary fan, behind the scenes, etc fan; however, the ones on the DVD are quite interesting.  I mainly brought this to show my love for the series and to watch whenever I feel like it.
B002ZG994U|5.0|this was one of the best movies of this type(remake)or any other action movie i have seen in a long time!! definitley woth watching if not purchasing!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|After watching this DVD, I realized again why I liked it so much after seeing it in the theater.  I am a Trekkie, and this movie is definitely for fans.  It's like watching \\"Star Trek Babies;\\" each character has his or her introduction and one delights in comparing it to the characters portrayed in the series and the movies.  James T. Kirk comes from tragic and heroic origins but lives a reckless life prior to enrolling at Starfleet.  Spock is singled out for being half-human and half-Vulcan from childhood.  Other characters are presented in sympathetic, tongue-in-cheek fashion.  The ensuing adventure, however improbable, sets the stage for the stormy forming of the U.S.S. Enterprise's top brass.    The visual effects are all the more effective because the producers of the film went out of their way to incorporate *photography* over CG, where possible.  This produces a very radiant and breathless cinematography.  It is not for no reason that this movie won an Oscar for Best Make-Up over \\"Avatar\\"; it uses real make-up on real actors and actresses!    Highly recommended.
B00356CO1E|5.0|wow.  I wasn't sure I would like it 'cause of Jillian's \\"tough\\" attitude, but she actually keeps it reasonable and motivates quite well!  The workout is fantastic and I truly sweat, which I can't say of all exercise I do.  No time to get bored with a routine 'cause you're on to something else.  She has sequences, but they're short.  I remember the old aerobic routines where by the end I would be \\"this again\\" to myself and bored 'cause I had done it so many times.  Not so with this.    I was also concerned about my joints, but because the moves switch after 30 seconds or so, my knees did really well.    Regarding doing this every day, it goes against what I've always heard about muscles needing a day to recover.  Because of this and my joints, I'm going to stick to every other day.    I was very pleasantly surprised.  Great buy and I highly recommend!
B0034G4P7Q|2.0|starts off with a lot of aggresive and crisp dialog, edgy logic and emotionally involved.  problem is movie eventually falls into the stereotype of the socially awkward nerd and the ultimate betrayals don't feel right emotionally and end up depicting zuckerburg as much too naive.  i think the screenplay took too many liberties with the history and ends up feeling false and contrived, with the elaborate dialog undermined ultimately by a hollow emotional feel that doesn't add up.

0156012197|4.0|As much as I love and adore this book, I was disappointed to find that my book was carelessly packaged. The ends of my book were bent pretty bad in the box and there appeared to be dirty marks on a couple of the pages. However, this is an amazing book with a great message for everyone to take in.
B000002ZR7|3.0|Several reviews have noted that the interpretation here is feminine. I might suggest another way of saying this is she doesn't play with authority.  Certainly, parts are meant to be delicate, but there are parts which are much more successful played with some force.  Granted, this may be a matter of taste, but the music doesn't grab me here where it does in the Gould and Perahia CDs.  It's almost as if she is playing the music but isn't really into it. My wife, a Bach nut, didn't immediately recognize it, which is extremely unusual and telling. She is one who comes up with a BWV number after hearing about eight bars.    To my ears the engineering leaves something to be desired, not bad, but I found myself wondering if something was wrong with my system.  There is very little presence.    So, one star off for the interpretation/playing and one star off for the recording quality.      Disappointingly, this CD likely won't be seeing much play in my house/auto.

B004ID52YO|5.0|With the onslaught of retro Europop bands that have infected the airwaves over the past 5 - 7 years, White Lies previous release was an oasis in a bleak musical desert.  While it teetered on the brink of plagiarism at times, it managed to instead take in all the GOOD parts of the late 80s and early 90s alt.pop sound and make something that didn't get old quick (again).  At times \\"To Lose My Life\\" seemed to be that lost record you didn't know existed back in the day.  It was unique.  It was brilliant...I never took it out of my various audio devices it was that good.<br /><br />Enter Ritual...have they done anything new, nope.  But that's what again is BRILLIANT.  With a little success at their backs, they've created ANOTHER masterpiece that is haunting, yet poppy.  Smart without being pompous, and truly, truly emotional without sounding the slightest bit contrived.  This record is filled with more sonic guitar and keyboard assaults with Harry McVeighs eerily familiar voice scratching it's lovely nails across three decades of poorly done copycat disasters.  Listening to White Lies is like getting Joy Division, The Cure, Depeche Mode, Bauhaus and Duran Duran all together for an orgy and holding that sweet little love child into it's new life as our musical protectors.  With a little more of an electric influence showing it's face, Ritual is big, deep and loud and definitely something that will go down in history as a genre saving piece of music.  After one listen I already feel like these songs have been with me for years...good times.
0545265355|5.0|If you like Harry Potter or Enders Game, its like a mixture between the two series.  It is a little dark in feel but I am glad I bought the trillogy because the auther is really good at keeping you hanging at the end of every chapter and book.
1577314808|2.0|There are many paths to enlightenment but only one path to salvation.  That I believe this is irrelevant, or is it?       Tolle describes [what seems to me] a solid psychological meditative technique in his book, in a simplistic way that even I can understand, but hasn't meditation, per se, been taught and practiced, especially in Eastern cultures, for centuries?        How the ancients must be laughing at Tolle's attempts to explain it anew.  Well, they could if there were, as Tolle clearly believes there is *not,* life after physical death, that is, death when the heart stops beating, not the pseudo figurative \\"death\\" to the physical that Tolle would no doubt speak of.   As a Buddhist might say of nirvana (liken it to Tolle's encounter with \\"Being\\"), \\"Those who say do not know and those who know do not say,\\" a fact even Tolle acknowledges:  \\"...and yet I am saying,\\" he writes, emphatically.        In any event, Tolle teaches useful coping techniques seated in meditation, but what is his real agenda?        If you cannot see by the time you reach the final chapter that he wishes to convince all that there is no God, no deity, of any kind; that we, upon practicing his techniques can become \\"God,\\" you haven't actually been paying attention.       He says that the concept of God has merely been misinterpreted and misunderstood by the masses all these years.  (So, may all ye who believe and worship in the God of your forefathers know that you have had it wrong all along.  Eckhart Tolle says so.  I hope you understand I am being sarcastic.)        Tolle makes countless statements specifically debunking the Christian faith and, by less obvious implication, any other faith whereby one believes in a deity.  He saves the bulk of his blatant onslaught against Christianity until the very last chapter, though he touches upon it and hints upon it from the very beginning.       Tolle stops just short of calling himself another Christ.  Actually, he does equate himself with Christ, whom he considers a fellow fully enlightened one, granting with no hint of egotism whatsoever, that through practicing his techniques, all of us can become equal to Christ, per his definition.       On the paper jacket of the hardcover copy, in a biographical blurb, he claims that he had his first encounter with his \\"Being\\" at the age of twenty nine--in his thirtieth year.  You know, they say Jesus Christ was 30 when he appeared on the scene, performing miracles and bringing \\"the good news\\" to the masses.       NOT having read a variety of spiritual works of numerous spiritual leaders, ancient or modern, as that is not a need of mine, but having read The Power of Now, my only positive take away from the book is this:  a solid psychological technique which, if applied wisely, can make life as I know it here on earth easier, better, or happier, in any circumstance.  Life may even feel like one step this side of Heaven at times, but I know it isn't. Heaven, that is. I do not buy Tolle's argument that this \\"Being\\" I may get in touch with while meditating is my salvation, my God or anything other than a pure state of peace of mind--a creation of and a state allowed by, my mind.  This I know; how Tolle missed it while studying the Christian scriptures, I will never understand.  (There are certain things you do not want to be in denial of, Mr. Tolle.)       The mind is a powerful tool; master it, but be careful who or what you worship.    ~~~

B000007WNN|5.0|If you like any song by the Cult buy this album. You will not be disappointed at all. I great piece Rock and Roll. Every single song on here I have listened to hundreds of times and I am still not tired of them. Lil Devil and  Aphrodisiac jacket are tremendous standouts.  Even Born to Wild is not that bad    I suggest even getting the Vinyl.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I don't like any of the actors but somehow they brought it together to make an entertaining and feel good movie.  Movies like these are far too rare in todays world.  You will like it.
0007274939|5.0|This is an outstanding survival book.  It has everything in it from how to set up your survival kit to preparing your mindset for surviving any situation you could find your self in; be it land or sea, arctic or tropic.  Useful full color pictures and descriptions of poisonous and edible plants and animals are also included.  I am completely satisfied with the content and scope of this handbook.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, one of the best movies of the year and one of the highest quality blu-ray releases of all time.  I believe that part of the reason I enjoyed this movie so much was because I am a video game and superhero nerd.  I'm sure there are a lot of references that will go right over some people's heads.  That aside, I did watch this with one of my less nerdy fans, and he thought the movie was fantastic.  Also: the action/fight sequences in the movie are surprisingly great.    If you've played the video game on the XBL Arcade or Playstation Network, you will be pleased that this movie goes right along with the game and you will love seeing some of the things from the game in the movie (and vice versca).    What I really need to speak of is the fantastic extras!  This is why this movie is one of the greatest blu-ray releases ever.  The director, Edgar Wright, really crams this thing full of extra content.  There will never be an \\"Ultimate/Super/Ultra\\" whatever you want to call it re-release of this movie, because I'm not sure they could find any more content to include.  I can't remember how many commentary tracks there are but pretty much every one of the actors is included as well as the usual behind the lens crew.  Something I really enjoyed was the outtakes.  Almost all of the actors had some time in the outtakes, you can tell that everyone really had a good time making this movie.
B002JG67L4|5.0|Teen daughter very happy with it. I bought it for the DVD included w/it to make it different from the usual music CD.
044654759X|3.0|2.5 rounded up     It's not so much that there is anything bad about this book, it is just that it is.... boring. A very large portion of the story is devoted to describing the day to day life of the characters who live in a small, seaside town. What one does as they get up, what they eat, how they cook, the routine conversations between family members, what they buy at the grocery store, which tablecloth to put out etc. etc., comprises not only most of the book, but each of our own daily lives. While familiar, it's NOT what most sit down to read about. We all live it. It doesn't need to be endlessly explained.  We KNOW already! Most people choose to read for an escape from the workaday life, not to re-hash it. That, along with the over-the-top climax makes this a rather disappointing attempt by a talented author

B00005BKZJ|5.0|I loved watching this quirky, fun movie years ago, and was delighted to find it available for sale as a CD. We need lots of CDs handy because after a hurricane, we get electricity back but have to wait a week or so more until all the connections are fixed to get cable TV. The whole neighborhood trades CDs to help entertain us. Sometimes it helps to drown the noise of the chain saws going on all around us!
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves Coldplay. Gave it to her for Xmas hoping there might be something on it she hadn't seen. She loved it and has watched it several times since receiving it.
B003PIUC02|3.0|I will be exchanging my copy for a new one because disk 1 did not play well.  Disk 2 had one glitch and 3 & 4 were perfect.  I only have one blue ray player, so I did not compare in another machine.  UPDATE:  I did return the original disk set.  The new set plays fine on all four disks.
030746363X|5.0|This is a revolutionary great book and will inspire you to complete your fitness goals. I've read many books and have been on a lot of roller coaster diets. So far this one is really great and has many tips outside of dieting to get your body hacked into shape. Some of the information seems a little bit scattered, but other than that is well organized.
B001IF5YLQ|4.0|This adapter is similar to the VGA-styled one of course, and now that I have both for different applications (DVI for 2nd monitor on Mac Mini at home, VGA for projector at work) I can say one thing, the DVI adapter at least allows the DVI plug to actually \\"plug in\\" completely and the screws can be secured, whereas with the VGA adapter insertion and rubber bands are about the best I can do.  But they both work.

B003DZX3SA|5.0|I'm a child at heart and still treasure childhood Disney animated movie classics. When seeking light entertainment, I enjoy watching family movies and I find that I have never gone wrong with a Disney feature film, especially if there was child in the home. Nominated for best picture, 1991. As with most Disney films, \\"Beauty\\" has a wonderful story and a timeless message... and if you watch closely, a dance scene between Beauty and the Beast that boasts a then state-of-the-art technical sequence for an animated motion picture.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I own the Mono and Stereo Cd set. I find the sound to be great . Then for my birthday I bought myself the Linn  Akurate Ds and a ripnas . I ripped all my music to flac and the sound was much better than my cd player  a Linn Ikemi. I found it hard to believe that the USB would sound better than both the Stereo and the Mono .When the Usb came in I made sure not to lift it by it's stem , it took about an hour to upload it to my ripnas . The only  problem is it will put Rubber Soul in an untitled folder  . With my I phone  I had all three versions and could play them randomly on my stereo system  . I decided to have a blind test on three subjects who were all musically inclined . The first two songs Blackbird and Eleanror Rigby which  they all preferred the 24 bit usb over  the other two formats . They all pick the mono as the least enjoyable . I liked  the mono but I was influenced ,being the only one who could see  the different formats . We listened for over an hour  and each time the order was the same 24 bit usb the 16 bit stereo and Mono . I did not play anything from Let it Be or Abbey Road being that they are only in stereo and I left Yellow Submarine alone. A few days later I listen again this time to Abbey Road usb vs cd I listen to Come Together first the 16 bit cd format very nice indeed but then I heard again on this time 24 bit and I was floored!!! It was richer, more space the sound stage  wowv . Not louder just better . I am very happy with The Beatles USB .
B002SAUCBC|5.0|by: zagnuts@yahoo.com  this king book is one of the many king books that i   just couldn't put down,even though i had a little trouble understanding the end.I had to rate it five stars because of the outstanding plot of the story.
B002ZG98C8|1.0|I thought this would be a fun movie, like Mexicans fighting Mexican corruption in Mexico to better the lives of Mexicans in Mexico.  Nope. Machete is worthless political trash with whitey Americans being the usual profiling target and illegal immigration a glorious social acceptance and human right. I mentally puked at the political platform and brotherhood-sisterhood of Mexicanism being the celebrated theme justifying illegal immigration into the United States.       De Niro is an idiot for being in this movie, like many of the other actors (who obviously needed the work). Or maybe it was their hypocritical world socialist/communist pseudo political left worldview which made them do it (support its political overtones). Oh and I read an earlier review which said this movie made fun of the liberal/left...a typical lie. This movie, in some sick twisted way, attempts to give legitimacy to violence (revolution?), sympathy in breaking Federal Law and ignorance in the U.S. Constitution. Even though attempting to be a slick \\"B\\" movie, this movie is no civil rights movie, just one of political stupidity and acceptable ethnic violence. It gloriously preaches a justification of a \\"Mexican Railroad\\" (sneaking in illegal immigrants into the United States) grotesquely trying to make similarities to the African American slaves of the Underground Railroad. Historically Sick, just like the \\"liberals\\" and uneducated who support this movie.       After observance of Martin Luther King Day, this movie really makes me ill.       Truly sad. It could have been a great movie if it were about Mexicans fighting Mexican Corruption in Mexico to better the lives of Mexicans in Mexico. This movie is as worthless as a Nazi propaganda movie. I'm glad I only barrowed it.

0307463745|2.0|Bought the book for my iPad    1) Very quick read     2) Lot's of quick simple ideas    3) You job will be to find the one or two that you can use in your company.  Don't try 10, just pick one or two.    4) Skim the book again in a year - find your next item or two.    5) At first I felt like I was reading, \\"Ignore Everybody\\" by Hugh MacLeod.  Or was it Linchpin by Seth Godin?  Turns out this book was not as good as theirs.    6) One or two ideas...for the year
B00364K6YW|5.0|Impeccable rendition of this classic.  From costumes, musical score, and brilliant acting this is a matchless performance.  With wit and dialogue, conspicuously absent in our modern times, these characters sparkle and amuse.What a breath of fresh air!
0812973992|3.0|It was an interesting read.  I wasn't sure where the plot was going until I had read a few chapters about different characters and how their lives would eventually all come together.  I was most intrigued with how the story of the tight rope walker was woven around the stories of the other characters.  I was really intrigued with the stories of the two Irish brothers were intertwined with Tillie and Jazzlyn.
B002BPQ0Y2|5.0|While similar to their older albums, it is unique and catchy.  Definitely a good album for parties to dance to.
B000TM1CKQ|4.0|The show is so funny, but when I got it in the mail, the box that I got it in was broken!!! It looked bad on the outside and the extra disk holder on the inside was broken. I was giving it as a gift too, and didn't have time to return it for another. That really stunk!!
B000JIHP88|3.0|I purchased recently for our son. The top part of the mobile is great with the moving leaves and hanging animals. The only thing that dissapointed me was the light up area with the music. It really does not light up very bright. Overall if you are looking to not spend a fortune this is a good mobile.
0345505387|1.0|I have been enjoyed reading and re-reading each addition to Gabaldon's Outlander series.  I was very disappointed in this book and would not recommend it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Having previously purchased the movie \\"Serenity\\" I felt compelled to order \\"Firefly\\" since the trials and tribulations of its crew had piqued my interest.  It was a very worthy purchase as the series provides a fine blend of imagination, adventure, humor, and drama, as well as insights into each the characters.  I wish the powers that be would resurrect Firefly or make a follow-up movie(s) to Serenity.
0545265355|5.0|The product came in a timely manner, and boy those books are amazing!  I couldn't put them down and had to borrow them from the people I was gifting them to.

0060254920|5.0|Got this book as a gift for our 4 year old along with a Rapunzel doll. Rapunzel obviously won on Christmas. However, after reading the book the first time, we have been reading it atleast once every day...my little one has memorized the words and indulges in a wide variety of pretend play. Family time is now pretend play time and we love it. Everytime you read this book, your kid will think of something new and exciting.
B0026OR2PE|4.0|In first 2/3rds or 3/4ths of the book it had lots of interesting facts about world-known inventors and inventions that are not known to an average person not have studied history of innovation. Besides - these facts were involved in really interesting ways to tell the story and prove different myths wrong or right. Though the last 1/3rd or 1/4th of the book became a bit boring with \\"You should do this\\" and \\"You should do that\\".. \\"to become innovative\\" type of read which I did not really enjoy as I really expected to get more facts and information here, not become innovative.    It is an interesting read, but I could have wished for a better ending.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I couldn't have for ask for better service. There was great care in packaging and seeing that the dvd did not get caught up in holiday mailing. I receives it in plenty of time for the  holiday. The condition was just as promised . I will not hesitate to ues this seller again.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|A remake of a Swedish horror film, a boy is being picked on by bullies at school and he encounters a young girl who just moved in next door. She is not really a girl, but a vampire who has befriended the boy. The girl needs blood to stay alive, creating a need for the man she travels with to take the lives of local residents. This is a very effective horror film that does not deluge the viewer with violence, but engrosses the moviegoer in the developing relationship at the film's core, and the fate of the schoolyard bullies of whom the boy is fearful.Very similar to the original, which is also good.
B001PB3RU8|4.0|I normally steer clear of most chart music these days after the onslaught of X-Factor and other cheap manufactured music, but when I heard Florence and the Machine on the radio I had to check the album out and I am so glad I did. This offers up a selection of tracks that will raise a smile, get your heart pumping and all performed in Florences's unique vocal style. The album opener `Dog Days are Over' is great and that drum beat is infectious and gets me clapping along with it nearly every time. There are so many good tracks on offer but I love `Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)' and `Howl', the latter one has a great chorus that will have you singing along to. This album has been highly lauded in the music press and industry (and garnered praise and awards at the Brit Awards) and that is normally a death knell for any self respecting band., but this album manages to live up to the hype and makes for around an hours great listening. Who couldn't be captivated by those vocals on album closer and cover `You've Got the Love'? Well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|A group of locals rob banks in a Boston neighborhood. The leader of the gang becomes involved with a woman who witnessed a robbery, and his relationship with her threatens the bond with his lifelong friend and partner in crime. The leader wants to leave Boston, but is forced into doing on final job. Ben Affleck really knows these Boston neighborhoods and their people. The film's authenticity is its strength, along with some taut, exciting bank robbery scenes.
B0026JWDQW|4.0|`Sunny Side Up' is a great album from Paolo Nutini and is a complete departure from his previous album, but it is still excellent. His voice really shines through on this CD and this has a great soul feel to it. The album opener `10/10' has a great upbeat ska feel and has me bouncing in my chair every time I play it. `Candy' and `Pencil Full of Lead' are the singles from the CD and are great songs but my favourite has to be `No Other Way' which has an amazing soul feel to it and when Paolo sings towards the end he reminds me of Otis Redding with that raw, emotional feeling he achieves. Paolo manages to show the depth of his talent more fully on this album and his voice is shown to be more mature and whilst at times I got the feeling he was trying to be a male Amy Winehouse, he manages to pull off this motown/soul sound that is so in vogue at the moment. This has some great tracks, top song writing, impressive vocals and is well worth a listen.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|A girl going through high school not so much as a misfit, but as an anonymous face, gains notoriety by pretending to be promiscuous. She becomes the target of a group of students led by a Christian girl who does not like her allegedly immoral ways and resents her newfound popularity. Easy A combines offbeat humor and a realistic look at high school life to bring to the audience an entertaining romp that will amuse and involve.
B0002BO0HG|4.0|After buying `I Am A Bird Now' and being completely captivated I quickly went out and bought the self titled debut CD by Antony and the Johnsons and if you enjoyed their second album it is a pretty safe bet you will enjoy this as well. It is mostly in the same style and still has Antony's wonderful and unique vocals. I love `Atrocities' and the piano playing throughout this track is both melancholy and beautiful. I also adore the chorus on `Divine' which raises a smile every time I play it. This took me a few more listens than IAABN to fully get into it and I found the strings a little more obtrusive on some tracks, but once you do you will be just as enraptured and impressed. The artwork is original and unusual but that sums up Antony and the Johnsons perfectly, original and unusual, but always great. Well worth checking out at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|A group of strangers are together on an elevator located in a high-rise building, when the elevator suddenly stops, and strange occurrences begin. An intriguing storyline that provides some thrills, but does not seem to quite live up to its promise. All of the players involved are unlikeable and there is little mystery as to what is occurring. There are some positive aspects to the film because as the lights go out, the audience anticipates what will happen next, but it all ends in an unremarkable conclusion. The film contains some good scares, and is a movie that is unremarkable but does contain some redeeming qualities.
B003H9MSPG|5.0|This gun is really cool! I love that it comes apart and it looks really intimidating because of its size. I like that it is clip loaded - you can fire up to 6 darts per clip - making it easier to use. I bought this as a gift for my 6 year old son and he absolutely loves it. The only thing I would change is to be able to remove the butt end like the front is removable, but once it is locked in it can't be taken out. It is great that it will hold 2 extra clips and it fires a REALLY long way! Great product if you like dart guns!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|A film that chronicles the process through which Facebook was created. Some young men attending Harvard discussed starting an online forum for college students to post personal photos and information, enabling them meet new people and develop relationships. One of them takes it upon himself to create the site, thus allegedly stealing the idea of the others. The story is told in flashbacks, with time alternating between the arbitration of the case and the time when the events happened.  Every aspect of the film is solid, from the musical score to the lighting to the acting. A little humor is sprinkled throughout, making it entertaining. Very well done, the movie is engaging, with strong performances all around.
1569242739|5.0|Vegans deserve awesome cupcakes too! And here are so many recipes! I am not vegan, but my boyfriend is, and his eyes lit up when he saw this book. These days there are awesome replacements for both eggs and margarine, so most recipes are so good you can serve them at a party of mixed diets, and no one will tell the difference. I love this book!
0307269760|4.0|To continue with my reading of Canadian literature, I decided to read Alice Munro's Booker Prize winning collection of short stories. Usually, it takes a lot for me to take a chance on short stories. I typically find them to be either too short (and I want a novel-length more) or too long (and I wonder why it bothered being a story at all). However, Munro is a master! She gives the reader just enough to keep you intrigued and unable to put the book down. Yet, each story feels complete and you can walk away from the collection feeling satisfied.    I enjoyed this collection a great deal because the stories dealt with some heavy issues that I think most short story writers shy away from. In this book, Munro tackles issues of spousal abuse, child abuse, adultery,  and long-kept secrets. Many of the stories do not have a traditional \\"happy ending\\" and most of the characters are far from being heroes (or even likable). Somehow this does not seem to be a problem for I couldn't put the book down from the second I opened its cover. Perhaps the reason is because Munro's work isn't really about the plot or storyline of the story but instead about the characters and the emotions that the illicit in the reader. With each story Munro triggers a different emotion or question to ponder from how to forgive, to what is degradation, to what is the difference between hatred and fear. Though the characters faded with time, these questions still run through my mind.       Due to these topics, this is not a book for a dabbler or one who is hunting for a good beach read. This is catered towards those who want their literature to challenge them, disturb them, and above all make them think. If you are one of those kinds of readers, you will not be disappointed.
B002FE5XVK|5.0|Having been a fan of Talking Heads right from their beginings... I had to grab this Blu-ray version of their movie.  It is so good, makes me regret even more, that I never got to see them in a live performance.  Listening with the commentary on was very enlightening... more good stuff.<br /><br />With the surround sound 'cranked', this movie is a real time trip... straight back to the 80's!<br /><br />Long live the Talking Heads... on DVD and CD!
B002ZG99CC|5.0|absolutely loved this movie. so appropriate for the way the world is today- overcoming obstacles and earning respect of the people around you. watched it with my daughter and she liked it too. very motivating, especially if your child plays sports to teach them to focus. highly recommend this movie!!!
B000W746GK|1.0|I was guaranteed that this movie \\"the chamber of secrets\\" would arrive in time for Christmas. That never happened and then I was informed that it was cancelled and no longer available. I was very disappointed and feel the site is not very responsible.

B002SRQ214|5.0|Quality product that has a speed to cost ratio few products can even come close to. Installed without a problem and it just shrugs off any task I throw at it.....some times I think it mocks me saying....\\"is that all?\\". If you have $160.00 burning a hole in your pocket and you desire computational speed then look no further !
B000X107GI|1.0|Received these batteries to replace the ones in the bathroom scale.  After several searches I ordered these as the price could not be beat.  Waited patiently for them to come arrive from somewhere overseas.  When they did arrive they looked as pictured; a sealed blister pack of 5 Maxell batteries.<br />Sadly not a single one of the batteries worked - they are stamped with \\"09\\" on every single battery (not sure if that is their expiration year but regardless they are duds.<br />Too bad as it seems like these got a large number of postive reviews.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|These headphones are really great.<br />The sound is good and the fit is comfortable.<br />A friend I play with on XBOX Live commented that the quality of my voice sounds much better, too.<br />I would highly recommend them to anyone.<br />One important note, these headphones are for the Xbox 360 only.  If you're looking for something you can use with multiple consoles (PS3, Wii, etc) you should look elsewhere.<br /><br />Things I really like:<br /><br />1) Sound is great<br />I use the included optical cable with my Xbox and it sounds great<br /><br />2) Integrated voice<br />This is what separates these headphones from non-gaming headphones.  You have a volume control for the normal game sound and a second one for the voice chat.<br /><br />3) Movable/removable mic<br />You can move the mic up and out of the way or completely remove it.  Nice.<br /><br />4) Very comfortable<br />The headphones don't squeeze your head and are very comfortable.<br /><br />There are a some things that would make these great headphones even better.<br /><br />1) Easier to use controls<br />Controls on both the headphones and chat cable could be better placed and easier to identify by touch (since you can't see them when they are on your head).  Make them stick out a little and oversized (no jokes, please).<br /><br />2) Rechargeable batteries<br />The headphones use two AAA batteries that last 15-20 hours, I'd guess, which is reasonable. It would be nice if the stand had a built in charger so you could use rechargeable batteries.  Yes, I know I could use my own rechargeable batteries, but I'm lazy and would like to be able to set the headphones on the stand and recharge without me having to change them out.<br /><br />3) Ear cups don't really block outside sound<br />This isn't really an issue if you're in a relatively quiet room, but if not, outside sound can be easily heard.  This may be preferable to some.<br /><br />All in all, a very good product.  You won't regret getting them.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|Ever wanted a fifteen minute escape into a world of music and fanasty? Then this is the movie for you.  This is a short fifteen minute cartoon about a young boy and a magical snowman.  There are no words, just a great story and beautiful music.  It can be enjoyed by all ages from young children to grandparents.  It is a personal family favorite for us that we watch each Christmas.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Best headphones I've ever played with. Audio is just right and very comfortable. The only complaint I have is battery life. I don't know how many sets of batteries I have all ready gone through. A good improvement would be some sort of charging set up with the receiver.
B0000AC8LR|4.0|I had never seen this movie in its entirity, so I had to get it and there were no disappointments, American movie noir at its best. I also got the soudtrack which I would not recommend unless you like to park your mind in a musical loop, most of the tracks sound alike except for the two with great lirics describing donnie's revolving threshold between reality and?     You write up the end.

B0037YOMWS|4.0|The calculator feels light and cheap in the hand and although the buttons click, there is inconsistency in the way they feel from button to button on the same calculator.  For that matter, I tried out several in a store and all had a different feel.  This is a reflection of the cheap quality of goods commonly made in China these days.  The calculator feels nowhere as solid as my old US made HP 12C.  But having said that, it adds several features my old one doesn't have and therefore is useful.  I like the solid heft of my 25+ year old 12C and will continue to use it for everything except those features that only the 30B has.  I don't feel like the 30B will be with me 25 years from now, particularly if I use it as much as I do my 12C.<br /><br />However, the calculator is faster than the standard 12 and offers many more features such as advanced mathematical and statistical functions not found on the 12C or 10bII.  All current HP calculators suffer from a cheapening of the keyboard, but the 30b still offers so much for the money.  Unfortunately, HP has decided to discontinue it in favor of the older 10bII with less features.  The 30b is a better looking calculator than the 10bII, offers many, many more features (scientific, mathematics and statistics) and has a better screen.  The keyboard and screen are superior to the 17bII+ which is still being made at a higher cost.  And compared to the competition this calculator has more features and is still better made than its TI and Casio counterparts.
B004EJ14V2|2.0|I had been looking forward to watching this movie for awhile. I'm a huge fan of 80s movies and I liked that this movie had intentionally modeled itself after John Hughes' successful formula. If they did it right, there would be more movies like this in the future.<br /><br />To put it simply, this movie was too unbelievable and clich&eacute;d to be enjoyable, even by John Hughes' standards. Beautiful girl who's supposed to be an outcast? Check (by the way, for an \\"ugly\\" invisible girl, she spends most of the movie successfully advertising for Victoria's Secret). Giant, rich high school where all the students look like they're in their twenties? Check. Christian fundamentalist stereotypes, just because? Check. Huge expensive pool party for high-schoolers? Check. Bland, perfect guy who gets the girl because the movie said so? Check. Nonstop overly-clever quips from precocious teenagers a la Juno? Check.<br /><br />This annoyed me in the same way \\"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist\\" did. The formula behind this movie was so blatant. If you're dying to mash up John Hughes and Diablo Cody and line your pocket with teenagers' allowances, can you be a TINY bit subtle about it? Maybe Penn Badgley really could be our generation's Ferris Beuler/Lloyd Dobbler, but making him stand outside a window with his iPod speakers blasting Peter Gabriel, just short of winking at the audience, is ridiculous. Yeah, we got it, even without the 80s movie montage.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|A gift for my dad. A very well done series, though not as good as Band of Brothers. Still worth watching.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Great movie, only one disc to watch in either blu-ray format or regular format. I bought this for the blu-ray.  I didn't watch any of the special sections on the blu-ray disc because all I wanted was the original movie in all of it's glory.  Didn't look at the other disc, just standard definition I assume.

0141439661|4.0|\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is the first published novel of Jane Austen.  Originally published in 1811, the novel went through several versions perhaps starting with \\"Elinor and Marianne\\" in 1795, though it is not certain.  I suspect that \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is the second best known work of Austen after \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and I would say that it is not as easy to read as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  One of the reasons for this is due to the importance of what was considered proper behavior at the time, and without an understanding of that standard of behavior, the motivation of the characters is hidden from the reader.  Nevertheless, it is still worth the effort to read and overall it is worthwhile.  At the same time, it is well worth reading an edition like the Penguin Classics version, which helps the reader understand the period and societal standards which play an important role in this novel.<br /><br />The main characters of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" are the sisters Elinor and Marianne, who are the daughters of Mr. Dashwood and his second wife.  There is a third daughter, Margaret and of course his second wife Mrs. Dashwood.  When Mr. Dashwood passes away, his estate passes to his son by his first wife, leaving the Dashwood women into lives of reduced means.  The two elder sisters experience nearly the same situations.  Both find love, then the shock of learning that those they love are pre-engaged.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is written in three volumes.  The first deals with the transition of the Dashwood women to their new lives where they leave their Norland home move to stay with distant relations (the Middletons) at Barton Park.  Elinor cares for Edward Ferras, the brother-in-law of her half-brother, and Marianne meets and is courted by John Willoughby.  Willoughby leaves suddenly for London, causing Marianne distress.  This volume also introduce Anne and Lucy Steele, two relations of the Middleton's who arrive as guests, but their arrival causes problems for Elinor who learns that Lucy is secretly engaged to her Edward.  In Volume II, it is Marianne who learns that Willoughby has become engaged to another, due to his wasting his fortune and need for wealth.  In Volume III the situations with the two sisters and those who they thought they loved is resolved, though in different ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\", in my opinion, is more difficult for a modern reader to digest, but that does not mean that it doesn't have anything to offer.  There are some wonderful moments and when presented in a scholarly format with detailed notes it can still be enjoyed the same way it was when first published.  I don't personally rate \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" as high as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but it is still a very good novel and an important piece of literature.
0385341679|5.0|**slight spoilers**<br /><br />It has come to an end. My most anticipated book of 2011 - I might not feel an obsession like this for a long time to come. Did we get answers? Oh yes. Are there still things to learn? Oh yes. Am I satisfied? More than I ever imagined I would be.<br /><br />There is so much that happens in this book and I don't want to give anything away. It feels like an impossible review to write. Mac is no longer MacKayla Lane. She is a new determined woman, ready to take on the world if that means she gets her Barrons back. Watching him die at the hands of her spear, almost threw her over the edge. But like Barrons always tells her - if you don't spread the ashes and poke it around for three days, it doesn't mean it is dead - and even that might not stop Barrons from coming back.<br /><br />What Barrons is we don't exactly find out, and I kind of liked that. We are not given a name to his kind. I assume in future books, this might be explored more. But we do learn about him, the things he is capable of and more about the eight men that resemble him. We learn the reason he seeks the book - and that reason very much shapes that man he is. It explains so much about his behavior.<br /><br />We learn who and what Mac is. We learn V'lane's roll in all of this. We learn more about Rowena, Alina, and Dani. Christian is still a big mystery becoming someone or something he is not even sure of. I don't think anyone is. I've heard rumors that Ryodan and Dani get a series, if that is true, I so hope that Christian plays a prominent role in those books.<br /><br />And of course, I was rooting for Mac and Barrons - that HEA that everyone was a little (or a lot) nervous about. I was very pleased with the end. It is a very \\"Barron-esque HEA\\" in my opinion. Intense, wild, dark.<br /><br />Shadowfever surpassed every expectation I had. For as many theories I have discussed, I was completely shocked at most of the outcomes. There was not a single aspect I was disappointed in. My favorite part is that Barrons and Mac stay so true to their characters. Barrons doesn't change, or yield to Mac. And I think KMM does an excellent job with keeping him so consistent. He stays broody, and possessive, and mysterious. An excellent end to my favorite series.c stay so true to their characters. Barrons doesn't change, or yield to Mac. And I think KMM does an excellent job with keeping him so consistent. He stays broody, and possessive, and mysterious. An excellent end to my favorite series.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I bought these headphones for my daughter to replace a Dell set that cost over $80. The first purchase was one of those where I didn't know anything about headphones but wanted to buy her a good set so I fell into the \\"more expensive must mean better\\" mode. The second purchase of the Plantronics set was done with the attitude of \\"well I'm not going to buy another expensive set if she's going to let the dog chew them up!\\" She likes the Plantronics set much more than the Dell ones, more comfortable, more clear and the mic is more sturdy & folds back into the set, very good idea. For less than twenty five bucks I don't think you can beat it![[ASIN:B001E45XT4 Plantronics GameCom 367 Closed-Ear Gaming Headset]]
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I had long been apprehensive to read Gladwell's books. I heard his style to be somewhat lacking in the sense that he never really develops his ideas. However, I finally bit the bullet and read Outliers simply because a conversation with a friend referred to a section in the book that I found fascinating: the effect of language on the comprehension of mathematics. I thought \\"what the heck\\" and decided to just read it.    Well, I must admit that this book IS exactly what I was afraid of, but it wasn't so bad after all. In fact, I found it to be concise, interesting, and, all in all, a rather pleasant read. Had the book been any shorter it would have seemed to lack substance, but even a page longer and I would have become bored and restless. It was kind of like watching a documentary about an interesting new subject in book form. It piques your interest, and then sort of leaves it at that...    I do think that he underestimates the power of genius and hard work, and that sometimes he makes it seem like success just fell into successful people's laps. As such, I can see some people arguing against his logic. However, if there is one thing we can take from his opinion, it is that we all deserve a chance' because those who had the chances are the ones who succeeded. (However, if such logic were actually applied, where would we be? Communism? What would be the point of competition at all?)    Anyways, I would recommend Outliers because it contains some interesting facts and opinions(well, as factual correlational data can be, I suppose), but if you're looking for \\"The Story of Success\\" and how it might apply to YOU personally, this will likely be a bit of a let down.    TL;DR: Nothing really happens, but it's short and sweet (and interesting!). Should have been titled: \\"Outliers: The Story of what may have made a lot of others successful, but not you\\"

0786868724|5.0|Knowing that I needed something uplifting to read after a recent surgery, a good friend gave me Mitch Albom's Have a Little Faith: a True Story.  Well, uplifted I was!  I started Have a Little Faith that night and didn't stop reading until I finished it the following day.  I have become a big fan of Rabbi Albert Lewis and the Reverend Henry Covington and especially, author Mitch Albom.<br /><br />Albom grew up in South Jersey and attended a synagogue founded by Rabbi Albert Lewis.  Although he married outside his faith, Albom still attended synagogue with his parents on Jewish High Holidays.  On one of those visits, Rabbi Lewis asks Albom if he will write his eulogy when he dies.  While Albom can't refuse the rabbi, he tells Lewis that he needs to get to know him better as a man.  So Albom begins an 8-year journey befriending his childhood rabbi and learning that this God-like man was actually human.  They laugh, they cry, they share, and they reminisce.  Through it all, Albom grows to know a rabbi who finds true joy in the Jewish religious, a rabbi who sings his way through life, a rabbi who has given most of his adult life to nurturing his flock.  At the same time, Albom is drawn to Henry Covington, a pastor who runs I Am My Brother's Keeper ministry for the homeless in Detroit (Albom's adopted home).  Albom relates the sad story of Covington's history, his drug use, his crimes, his jail term, etc.  But Covington has turned his life over to God and ministers to Detroit's many downtrodden.  Covington's church needs lots of financial help--the heat has been shut off, there is a large hole in the roof, the homeless in Detroit increase because of the poor economy.  But something about Covington's past keeps Albom from fully committing his help.  Over time, Albom is able to see the similarities between Lewis and Covington despite their different religious backgrounds.  Through his writings and his fund-raising efforts, Albom brings much needed attention and help to Covington's church.  The author also comes to understand that you serve God by serving man, and that it doesn't matter if that cause is Christian or Jewish.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed Have a Little Faith for a number of reasons.  I grew up with several Jewish friends in South Jersey, so this book brought back many childhood memories.  Albom is an accomplished writer, and a caring and compassionate man.  His journey of growth becomes his readers' journey as well.  In fact, when he finally gives the eulogy for Rabbi Lewis, he states \\"I sometimes wonder if the whole thing [the eulogy request] wasn't some clever rabbi trick to lure me into an adult education course.\\"  On a negative note, I was shocked to discover that Pastor Covington passed away suddenly in December 2010 at the age of 53.  However, his family and his church elders have declared that his work will continue.<br /><br />Have a Little Faith is not the type of book that I generally read.  But I am grateful for my friend's gift--it was the right book at the right time.  I have been told that I must next read the author's Tuesdays with Morrie.'s church.

B001USHRCK|5.0|We bought this Lego set for our ten year old son who loves Castle Lego. It took him about three hours to build. The tedious part is finding the correct pieces for each page. He was so excited when he finished building it and he plays with it and his other lego sets constantly. It is an expensive item, but no more expensive than any other lego set. It is Lego, though, and definitely worth it compared to other companies who sell similar items. The pieces always fit together without trouble.

But, would not buy from them again! Or reconmend them  to anyone.
0446195529|5.0|I've never read any of Mr. Baldacci's work before but after reading this story, I'll have to consider more of his work. It was just a fluke that I picked this book up as I was browsing B&N and saw a big stack of these near the back of the fiction aisles. I discovered that it was a political/military type thriller and though there did not appear to be any of the atypical DaVinci Code premises associated with most thrillers nowadays, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The story goes from one twist to the next and never seems to let up. I turned page after page wondering what was going to happen next. I really had no idea. That made the story that much better because, though I was never very good at second guessing things, in this case, I really had no idea what was going to happen next.<br /><br />The story is well written in short bursts that are easy to read and well-paced. I can't compare this book to any others he has written so others may see this story as not his best, but for a first time exposure, it was sure a fun ride!<br /><br />The plot twists kept on coming right to the last pages where there was a big surprise. Luckily, it turned out the way I would have wanted, otherwise I would have had a much different review.<br /><br />The brisk pace and constant twists and turns of this story made for a great thriller. If anything, he may have overdrawn the hero's expertise just a tad. He draws the hero as all-knowing and almost invincible yet he still gets fooled and almost killed in the process. He also alludes to a lot of his mysterious past but never lets the reader know too many of the details. I guess we'd have to read the earlier books to find that out. Otherwise, the story worked very well. Highly recommended.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|A sharpener in you pocket as well as your kitchen bench , this versatile tool is something everyone one should have. It has three sharpening modes , two draw notches and a fold out diamond steel, ideal for sharpening serrated edges and similar irregular shaped blades. You can also use it to sharpen blades \\" butcher's style \\" .    The first of the draw notches has two carbide cutters intersecting as a \\"V\\" at the bottom . Drawing your knife though this sets the angle of the edge , eliminates nicks and produces a sharp cutting edge . The second draw notch is made of ceramic cutters arranged in a similar way and these HONE  the knife edge to perfection, (not found on supermarket sharpeners).     I would recommend this tool for people looking for a good quality, yet cheap , sharpening system .

0545123275|3.0|Shiver was an okay book -- it didn't bore me out of my mind, but it wasn't amazing either. There were a few points where I was bored and had to push myself to keep reading (I hate not finishing books), but there were other times where I felt myself swoon a little bit over the romance between Grace and Sam. Their relationship was cute, even if at times it was a little sugary-sweet for my taste. The story was interesting, but the girl falling in love with the wolf thing was at times a little too Twilight-like; Maggie Stiefvater is a far better writer than Stephanie Meyer though, so the story was at least more enjoyable. I'll probably read Linger just to see where things go, but I'm not in any huge hurry to get to it.

1439153663|5.0|I simply can't believe The Kitchen House is Kathleen Grissom's debut novel.<br /><br />The Kitchen House is an interesting look at slavery from a unique perspective -- that of a young white indentured servant in the household of a slave-owning plantation. Seven-year-old Lavinia arrives at the plantation after having been orphaned onboard a ship crossing from Ireland, and she spends her days with the slaves of the kitchen house, living under the care of Belle (the master's illegitimate daughter with one of his slaves), and working with them in the kitchen and the big house. The slaves become Lavinia's family but she always remains separated from them to some extent because she is white, though this is not something she understands as a child. The book covers nearly 20 years of the lives of Lavinia, Belle, and the other characters; all the while, Lavinia begins to grow up and learn the truth of her position relative to those she cares about, and is forced to straddle two worlds -- black and white, master and slave. When things begin to fall apart, Lavinia is forced to make a choice that calls everything she's ever known into question.<br /><br />The events in this book were unimaginably tragic and at times depressing, but through it all the absolute best thing about the book is the characters. The characters became real as I read, and I kept reading because I felt completely compelled to know what happened to them. They were so much more complex than simple characterizations of white vs. black, master vs. slave. I think this was especially enhanced by the dual perspectives provided by the narration. Though most of the story is told through Lavinia's eyes, each chapter told from her point of view is followed by a chapter told from Belle's perspective.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is no surprise that this series about space cowboys and space cowgirls has such a following because it is truly fantastic, despite being so short-lived.<br /><br />This show had everything: quirky-but-likable characters, several interesting plots and backstories, a rather terrifying enemy that plagues the stars (reavers), amazing costumes (especially Inara's!), a sense of humor, awesome cast, adventure, romance, clever writing with funny one-liners, a ton of potential, gumption, grit, on and on and on.<br /><br />I cling to my fourteen episodes on DVD, as well as the movie!
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|I love this set.  As one of the few Americans without cable, I was unable to watch them as they were released.  I still can't watch Dr. Who as it shows in America.  That said, when the first discs were released, I almost bought them.  The reviews kept me from making those purchases and I'm glad I waited.  This set, while much shorter that the previous \\"series\\" sets, is so much more complete.  It offers special features on each disc as well as the Dr. Who confidential.  I am partial to David Tennant as the Doctor, so this set is a little sad if only because it marks the end of his era as the Doctor.  However, the acting is just as good through these programs as it was before.  He does a wonderful job as the Doctor, making these programs rewatchable. In other words, I would watch these again just as much as I watch the other episodes again.  For me, it's when ever I need a Who fix.  If there is a downside, it's more with the writing than the acting.  The lack of a constant companion was rather out of character in my opinion, although, they did handle that issue.  I still felt like he should have had someone with him at the end.  I don't recall the Doctor ever regenerating alone before.  Over all, I definitely give this 5 stars.  I really enjoyed it.  Any Doctor Who fan will.
0060936223|5.0|Writing: A  Passion: A+  Subject matter: B    The Poet, the godmother of punk, has written a memoir of her early years shared with the Artist, Robert Mapplethorpe. Admittedly, these folks were not part of my youth or culture, and I read this book solely because it won the National Book Award amidst rave reviews. The only thing I knew about Patti Smith was that she wrote \\"Because the Night\\", and my only knowledge of Robert Mapplethorpe was that he was a counter-culture homosexual who took salacious pictures and died of AIDS.    First of all, this book is beautifully written, and that alone should entice any reader to consider it. She re-counts her working class childhood, which turns into years of struggle in New York City during the 1960's, living with Mapplethorpe as both pursue their art. Mapplethorpe grew up in a strict Catholic household, served as an altar boy, and met Smith when she was literally living in the street. They came of age together in the bawdy art world of the Chelsea Hotel, meeting poets, painters and novelists of renown.    The passion for their art is a major theme throughout the story, along with the hard work and devotion to each other. It's a story of love and friendship; sensitivity that Smith describes as aesthetically as anyone I've read. She evokes compassion for her lover when she realizes that he is homosexual and is going to leave her. But they never really separate and continue their special caring relationship, both looking out for the other, sharing their happiness and eventual tragedy.    Smith captures the devastation of the gay community with poignant prose, but it's not a story only of heartbreak. Both Smith and Mapplethorpe achieve their dreams together, becoming celebrities and fulfilled artists. Their ambition, hard work and mutual love for each other carry the day. The characters are perfectly developed with all the necessary complexity; you can't help but love these people.   Highly recommended.
0385342047|2.0|I have to say I am somewhat disappointed in this latest installment of Shopaholic. While I enjoy reading this entertaining series, it is seriously bordering less on being \\"cute and enjoyable\\" and more on \\"pointless and annoying\\"  very quickly. I found it hard to swallow the fact that the whole plot revolved around Becky's insatiable hunger to coordinate the perfect surprise party for Luke and not more about her young daughter, which, hello? the book is named after! It is also harder to sympathize with a character who exceedingly more and more is going on ever growing twisted adventures of debt and somehow is loved and rewarded entirely at the end by sheer dumb luck. These books are losing their humor and starting to read more like a Disney fairytale more than anything else. I picked up this book thinking that maybe just maybe it would reference a more responsible Becky given the current dour economic climate but instead, I was treated to 414 pages of virtually pointless dribble that left me scratching my head as to why Luke still tolerates her and doesn't divorce her merely for his health and not risk more headaches from his growingly deceitful and manic wife. Although I appreciate that the series is still continuing, I am having serious doubts of whether I will even bother picking up the next book as it does not seem now that there will be any maturation of the collection's lead character at all. Its a shame too. Kinsella could have really proven that Becky could do more than shop but it does not seem that will ever happen.

There is no \\"100th episode featurette disc\\", not even available anywhere, there are awesome gag reels at the end of each season.  Season 5 is an amazingly awesome six disc set! I had a problem with my seller and ended up returning the DVD set to them, 1.Product not as described on the Amazon.com site-6 disc vs. 7 disc set, 2.Product not mailed to me until almost 10 days after I ordered it!  Amazon's policy is two business days for their sellers to ship product. Although I later purchased this somewhere else, and might I add for alot less than the seller I bought it from, IT IS SO AWESOME, I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SEASON SIX IS ON DVD TOO!  Chances are, I'll be back on Amazon.com to order it as soon as it comes out!  Thanks!
B003BKF696|5.0|Just a phenomenal CD, I have never listened to a CD over and over like this one, and is the only CD I have (out of more than 100) where I don't hit the \\"skip\\" button.  His rich baritone voice, the drums, the guitar, the arc of each song, the sequence of songs on the CD, the wonderfully metaphoric and melancholy lyrics, not a cliche to be found.  By the time he sings \\"The storm will suck the pretty girls into the sky\\" on track 4, your ears, soul, and mind will be near orgasm.  If you are in your car, just try not to miss your turns and exits while listening to this CD.    If you are looking for an upbeat CD this isn't for you (for instance, \\"Sorrow found me when I was young, sorrow waited, sorrow won\\").  Or if you want literal, cliched lyrics.  For instance, someone here criticized \\"I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees, I never married, But Ohio don't remember me\\" as nonsense.  Only if you don't know what a metaphor is.  He returns to Ohio, dazed (head buzzing) by the weight of life and of trying to make a living, and even though he never settled down anywhere else, when he returns home to Ohio to earn a living (which you get from other lyrics) finds that Ohio isn't home any more.  I haven't figured out all the lyrics, but I'm enjoying the experience of trying to figure them out.    If all artists took albums as seriously as this one, where every song is excellent, purposeful, and well placed, maybe the making of albums (as opposed to making appr. 10 songs and sticking them together on a CD) wouldn't be such a dying art.  Those of you 35 and over probably know what I mean.

1599218011|1.0|It's so awesome when people tell us things that we intuitively feel.  But while it's important to feel good, it's also important to be real.  The credibility for this book comes from the author being a \\"Stage IV Cancer Survivor.\\"  But not all cancer is the same.  She has a very rare cell type that often does well without any treatment at all.  You can't compare her experience to the vast majority of cancer victims.  She is intentionally letting frightened people who are facing the abyss infer that eating their veggies will make it all better.  That's not honest, and that's not right.  She takes a basket of impressive sciency factoids and stitches them together into conclusions that aren't proven to be true (except that they say the easy answers that we hope to hear).   It is probably a good thing to eat a diet that includes a wide variety of foods.  And anything that reduces excessive calories will go far to reduce the crushing epidemic of diabetes and joint disease.  But my Dad lives on meat, grease, and little white donuts.  He's 85 and goes swing dancing 3 times a week.  Do you want to read his book?
B004FS27JK|4.0|It is hard to believe that it has been 30 years since Whitney Houston had been discovered by music mogul Clive Davis, singing in a New York club called Sweetwater, singing backup for her mom, Gospel great Cissy Houston, and since then, she had really catapaulted her way to the top of the charts. Not only breaking records, by being the first female singer to debut at #1 on Billboard, to being listed in The Guiness Book Of World Records in 2006 as the most-awarded female singer of all-time with an astonishing 415 awards worldwide, including being named most influential diva of the past 25 years according to the website idolator, and having the highest-selling soundtrack of all time with 1992's The Bodyguard. Yet, the past several years many people have forgotten about her and labeled her as a joke so much, that she had considered leaving the music industry. Thankfully, many people have recently re-discovered her beautiful voice with the Platinum-selling 2009 album I Look To You, and her return to the world. Nevertheless, many people have been looking for a definitive Whitney Houston hits collection, but will they find it here? Yes & No is the answer.<br /><br />The 2011 Essential Whitney Houston is a strong double-album that showcases Whitney's glory era from the 80's and 90's well. The collection does hit that note well by including her biggest hits from her showstopping ballads inclduing the dominant and tried and true I Will Always Love You, Saving All My Love For You, to dance gems like So Emotional and I'm Your Baby Tonight, to strong collaborations including Heartbreak Hotel with Faith Evans and Kelly Price and Count On Me with Cece Winans from Waiting To Exhale. The collection still handles well, but it does overlook a few of Whitney's big songs. The double-album overshadows When You Believe, her Oscar-winning duet with Mariah Carey from The Prince Of Egypt and Why Does It Hurt So Bad to just name a few songs. Also, the collection isn't really anything new. If you've bought the overseas edition of the 2000 Whitney: The Greatest Hits collection, it is the exact same track listing. So if you are looking for songs from her 2009 album I Look To You or 2002's Just Whitney like Million Dollar Bill or Try It On My Own, you aren't going to find them here.<br /><br />Still all in all, there haven't been many definitive collections that have completely defined the legacy Whitney Houston has showcased well over the years. But honestly, this one does come close as possible. It is a great buy for die hard Whitney fans, as well as those who've just discovered the past few years why Whitney is defined as \\"The Voice.\\" It is a great buy for anyone whom is still so emotional over her songs, and her songs have been the templates for so many singers like Jennifer Hudson and Brandy. It is no wonder Whitney has been so domiant as a singer, but also the collection is the closest to a definitive reflection of why Whitney's voice is still so emotional.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B<br /><br />Price: B 1/2+<br /><br />Remastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+<br /><br />Track Listing: Disc 1 1) Saving All My Love For You 2) Greatest Love Of All 3) One Moment In Time 4) I Have Nothing 5) I Will Always Love You 6) Run To You 7) You Give Good Love 8) All At Once 9) Where Do Broken Hearts Go 10) If You Say My Eyes Are Beautiful 11) Didn't We Almost Have It All 12) All The Man That I Need 13) Exhale (Shoop Shoop) 14) Count On Me 15)I Believe In You & Me  16) I Learned From The Best 17) Same Script, Different Cast 18) Could I Have This Kiss Forever<br /><br />Disc 2 1) If I Told You That with George Michael 2) Fine 3) My Love Is Your Love 4) It's Not Right But Its Okay 5)Heartbreak Hotel 6) Step By Step 7) Queen Of The Night (remix) 8) I'm Every Woman 9) Love Will Save The Day 10) I'm Your Baby Tonight 11) So Emotional 12)I Wanna Dance With Somebody 13) How Will I Know 14) I Will Always Love You (remix) 15) Greatest Love Of All (remix)16) It's Not Right But Its Okay (remix) 17) I'm Your Baby Tonight (remix))

B002ZCY7SW|4.0|So I was reading some of the reviews and I am thrilled to know that I'm not the only one who hated everything about Dana Walsh. The beginning story of her and Kevin? That was not needed at all. It wasn't strong enough and I couldn't help but think about one thing: Dana, you're a CTU Agent. You have too much pull to let some two-bit low life back you up into the corner.<br />That right there let me know that something fishy was going on. However, all of that wasn't needed.<br />And um...when the hell do they plan on finding that dead PO in CTU? Did they forget about that?<br /><br />I really wanted President Hassan to make it and my heart nearly broke in two when they found him dead. But wasn't that scene played out exactly like in Season 3 when they were trying to find that guy responsible for the virus? Yep.<br /><br />I found a lot of this season's ideals repetitive and so it was much harder to watch the first half than the last. After that, this show rocked! I was on the edge of my seat the rest of the way.  After Renee got shot, I thought, \\"This is it. Jack's about to lose it.\\" I was right. But I wasn't expecting his ass to go THAT hard... Just when I thought I knew what Bauer was capable of, he has amazed me once more when he went rogue and killed all of those Russians(with the exception of the Russian President he almost sniped). Everybody was after him and he was after everybody and I just loved it. What a way to end the show.<br /><br />Damn...if only they could sneak another season in.<br /><br />Oh well. Nothing left for them to do but take it to the big screen.<br /><br />Good season. Not the best, but definitely one of the strongest.<br /><br />4 stars only. Blame it on the Dana Walsh saga.
074322454X|3.0|Prompted by the recent death (at age 92 years) of Major Richard Winters, I read \\"Band of Brothers\\" (BoB) which had been languishing on my bookshelf for several years.  Having seen the excellent dramatization of BoB on DVD, I wasn't too anxious to read Ambrose's prose, having been somewhat disappointed in his previous histories (I've read \\"Citizen Soldiers\\" and \\"D-Day\\").  What I've come to expect from him is \\"popular\\" military history: readable, interesting, filled with moving vignettes and short on explicit detail.  In other words, no Anthony Beevor or Max Hastings here.<br /><br />BoB conforms to the Ambrose type. What his writing fails to convey in terms of the drama, depth of character development, tension, the fever-pitch of battle were all deftly done in the TV series. A few illustrative examples might suffice.  The protagonist (Major Winters) is portrayed by Ambrose as a vessel filled with inner virtue.  He is intelligent, calm, capable and skilled at doing a nasty job which needs to be done. I have absolutely no reason to doubt that, but in Ambrose's telling, Winters comes accross as a Frank Capra character: Jefferson Smith at arms.  The TV series depicts a more nuanced character with some individual traits rather than the \\"citizen soldier\\" stereotype Ambrose seems intent on establishing.  Ambrose's depiction of Capt. Sobel is a bit harder to assess.  The initial description is nasty, petty and ad hominem.  Later, Ambrose seems to make amends, noting that (despite Sobel's martinet character and lack of leadership skills), his ruthless dedication to the physical development and unit cohesion payed off in the crucible.  Capt. Nixon is alternately dismissed with pejorative characterizations as a \\"rich\\", \\"Yale educated\\" and \\"alcoholic\\" man but somehow, despite his \\"alcoholism\\", he earned the admiration of Winters, executed his responsibilities in a competent and professional manner and, according to the \\"Where are they now?\\" concluding chapter, somehow managed to live a long, fulfilling, professionally successful life: not quite the medical definition of an \\"alcoholic\\" now, is it?  Finally, Ambrose commits a couple of factual blunders (minor, to be sure) which I would not expect of a professional historian.<br /><br />In summary, the men of E Company were, no doubt about it, real, genuine heroes.  They illustrate exactly what the catch phrase \\"Greatest Generation\\" is meant to illustrate. While this is all more or less clear from Ambrose's history, the prose is generally tepid and uninspiring and the snippets of oral history appear in the text without really exciting much interest (although they should). Its as if Ambrose has managed to congeal a dramatic story to the point where it is almost stuck in amber.  This is one of the very few examples of military history where I felt more (much more, in fact) was derived from the movie than from the text.a long, fulfilling, professionally successful life: not quite the medical definition of an \\"alcoholic\\" now, is it?

0061841935|5.0|I love this book.  I listened to Craig Ferguson reading it.  He is absolutely fantastic.  I think when the subject matter is this raw, it's relatively easy for an author to put some words down on paper and release it to the masses.  It's another thing altogether to listen to the author tell the story of his life.  It made me laugh and cry.  Very highly recommended.

She relates all this matter-of-factly, no pretense at bourgeois morals. Robert was out hustling for rent money by then, and tho they lived together, they were no longer lovers.

0374290024|4.0|Attempts to resolve the riddle of civilizations usually fail due to the wrong assumptions brought to the study, assumptions about economics, assumptions about science and a possible science of history, and assumptions about evolution and the nature of human emergence. Attempts to figure through the issues of economics always throw the analysis out of whack, because economic systems are not the prime determinant of civilizations, even if their momentum finally overtakes the whole and dominates all outcomes. The innovations of the early modern in Europe were decisive in creating a new form of civilization, but the sudden crystallization around capitalism just at the end, if anything, bent that great advance out of shape. The efforts by Toynbee and Spengler to study world history after the rubric of 'civilizations' has also confused the issue, as has the false distinction of East and West. Civilizations are like clouds, and too diffuse to be determining organisms of historical evolution. As to the question of evolution, Darwinism has consistently thrown all analysis out of whack and, in league with capitalist hubris, reduced all analysis to the 'tough guy' ideologies of Machiavellian nihilism cum historical materialism rendered conservative, etc, etc....<br /><br />A better approach is to simply look at the clear structure of world history as a whole, which unexpectedly shows the answer to both economic fundamentalism, and evolutionary social darwinism. The rise of the West follows a clear pattern of historical progression and occurs on schedule in the sixteenth century for a brief surge of three centuries. The subsequent economic domination/decline phase is misleading. The clear macro structure in a sequential logic of developmental evolution behind the emergence of Civilization, if not 'civilizations', resolves the riddle of advancing civilizations and shows a very simple logic behind the temporary dominance of the 'West'. The resemblance to the issues of the Axial Age is remarkable and shows that it is not a question of civilizations but of differential time-slices of such, precisely what we see in the modern transition, only secondarily an economic phenomenon.<br />In general economic historians are so far off the mark as to make their analysis ridiculous, if not dangerous. The temporary dominance of the West due to the overgrowth of economic fundamentalism has spoiled its deeper contributions. If we examine the Axial period we can see that its contributions were larger than the economic and imperialistic, factors which soon destroyed the larger advance. The same process is underway now as globalization creates an economic orgy followed by, nothing much but decline, and in the modern case, environmental madness.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1450060234 World History And the Eonic Effect: Civilization, Darwinism, and Theories of Evolution Fourth Edition]]markable and shows that it is not a question of civilizations but of differential time-slices of such, precisely what we see in the modern transition, only secondarily an economic phenomenon.

I really like the raw, unrehearsed singing and playing. I think The Colonel overdid his control on Elvis' records. It would have been great to have a reunion before Elvis' death to revisit this session. I also like hearing the Gospel songs. They reveal the soul and inspiration of all 4.
159448385X|5.0|I had to read the Kite Runner for an english class. At first I was quite wary of it, having gotten negative reviews from a friend who had read it previously. She thought it was very depressing, but personally, I found it fascinating. A Thousand Splending Suns lives up the Kite Runner's stellar reputation and perhaps even surpasses it. I loved how the book follows the stories of two women (their lives then collide and tie everything up beautifully), maybe I am biased for being a woman myself. I was amazed that a man could have that kind of insight into the female mind. I could relate to both of them -Despite not being a muslim woman, or having a lot of knowledge on their culture and beliefs. I found their characters real and interesting. Mariam and Laila, who although are opposites and have been raised very differently complement each other just so, to make the story really hook you in. Hosseini has a way of creating characters by building them out of details and specific anecdotes that truly captivated me. This book was a window into a whole world I've sadly just looked over and dismissed. Over all, this book was just very interesting. I finished it in a couple of days, and was very sad to see it end. I am anxiously awaiting Hosseini's next masterpiece.

I was wrong.<br /><br />There is so much packed into these pages that when I think back to the question, \\"Who is the beast?\\" it seems like a lifetime ago.  It's no wonder you don't get much information from the summary, regarding what this book is about (it mostly recaps the series as a whole.) I find that even trying to talk about it in generalities reveals fantastic developments in the plot. So if you haven't read \\"Shadowfever\\" yet, I urge you to stop reading here, with my reassurance that it's a fantastic book that left me wholly satisfied and warm inside.<br /><br />****EARLY STORY SPOILERS AHEAD****<br /><br />The first chapter of this book shredded me.  When Mac thought she had killed Barrons, I cried for her. I ached.  Then I watched her put herself together; to take the hard lessons he taught her and live so that his death was not in vain.  This is not the Mac of [[ASIN:0440240980 Darkfever (Fever Series, Book 1)]]. She is powerful, but hollow.  She finally gets her showdown with the Lord Master with decidedly anticlimactic results.<br /><br />Mac seemed to learn so much about herself and her feelings with Barrons' death. It was disappointing to see so much of it go out of the window when they were finally reunited.  She was ready to end the world for him, yet suddenly, overhearing a phone call makes her regress utterly?  It was one of the few parts of the book that left me frustrated.  It was hard to see the roles reverse between Barrons and Mac... to see him so vulnerable... And when she finally looked inside his mind and learned what he was feeling while she was Pri-ya... Sigh.<br /><br />***SPOILERS OVER***<br /><br />Without spoiling any more, I  can tell you some of the questions that are finally answered: What is Mac?  Who killed Alina and why? Who is the Unseelie King? Who is the King's consort? Who is the Dreamy-Eyed Guy? Why has Barrons been pursuing the Sinsar Dubh? Who is Cruce? Who was the dying boy in Barrons' memory? What is under the garage?  And perhaps the best question of all... who is the real villain in the story?  The answer to that last one blew me away.<br /><br />Karen Marie Moning has created a tale of twists and turns that kept me guessing until the very end.  NO ONE should read this book without reading the other books in the series first.  And after reading this fifth installment, I'm sure many fans will go back to the previous books and re-read the stories from a new perspective, knowing truths we never dreamed of when it all began.  There are enough threads that I can easily see more books in this Fever world, but I promise there is no cliffhanger here.  Just a fantastic ending to a creative and enthralling story.<br /><br />I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could.s Mac?  Who killed Alina and why? Who is the Unseelie King? Who is the King's consort?

In this film after a computer prediction that Rocky would beat existing champion Mason the Line Dixon if there were to fight at their peak) Rocky decides to fight again. He trains for a 10 Round exhibition fight with the champ. The film is ok and is more like the first two films than the other ones. The ending is predictable but still inspiring.

B0039TD7PY|5.0|Those of us \\"of a certain age\\" will remember these tunes, voices and styles, and will likely be thrilled view the video of the performances.  But people of any age who enjoy folk/rock style music at all owe it to themselves to watch and listen to this fantastic compilation.<br /><br />Detail enthusiasts (like me!) will appreciate that the accompanying band is made up of the same musicians who accompanied both of these artists on many, if not most, of their plethora of earlier releases.<br /><br />After I got my copy, I ended up buying several more copies for friends and family, and all agree with me that it's just great music to listen to, and a delight to be able to watch it performed live.<br /><br />This reviewer (a musician myself, playing keyboards, pedal steel and dobro) couldn't be happier with my purchase.
0307346617|5.0|World War Z, or simply WWZ, is a masterpiece in the Zombie genre. Most of my experience with zombie entertainment comes from movies, and many of them have a cheesy feeling (even those that don't try). I had similar expectations with WWZ, but this book was startlingly realistic.<br /><br />Max Brooks genuinely considers what would happen after the initial zombie outbreak. Most zombie stories deal with the initial outbreak and a small band of survivors, not WWZ! Brooks canvasses the entire planet in this epic zombie drama. He considers how small groups of survivors would respond to isolation, how members of the military would cope fighting an enemy that never relents, how world governments would (possibly) mitigate a worldwide plague, and even the environmental impact of a worldwide meltdown. In many ways, this book is more about how humans would be changed by a worldwide zombie outbreak than it is about the zombie outbreak itself; which is half of its genius.
B002ZG993Q|3.0|With all the advanced advertizing for this movie, my wife and I rented The American  and anticipated a fun evening watching an entertaining thriller.  That was not what occurred.<br /><br />The American is not a \\"thriller\\", but a slow moving crime story.  This film is similar to the \\"Spaghetti Westerns\\" made popular by Clint Eastwood in the 1960s, in that it has a slow moving plot, little dialogue, and highly symbolic scenes and gestures.  It is a character story with a moral.<br /><br />George Clooney stars as Jack, an assassin who is growing tired of his profession.  After being ambushed near a lake in Sweden, Jack flees to a remote village in Italy.  He functions with a false name, and takes what he hopes to be his last job, making an assault rifle for a colleague.<br /><br />Jack encounters two characters who attempt to reform him: a priest and a prostitute.  The priest, Father Benedetto, played by Paolo Bonacelli, senses that he is a criminal (a sinner who still intends to sin) but listens to him and accepts and befriends him.<br />The prostitute, Clara, played by Violante Placido, provides him with comfort and  understanding.  Clara offers Jack unconditional love and Jack slowly falls for her.<br /><br />The American is a film for a few.  The typical viewer may leave during the middle of the movie or wonder why they stayed.  Those who love character studies will likely enjoy the film.  I rate this film average.

The correct driver (extension) to use is PL2303 Mac OS X driver v1.2.1r2 version.

The device works well with National Geographics TOPO and other Mac compatible mapping applications.   I received prompt if not totally correct responses from customer support to my requests.

0756405890|4.0|The Name of the Wind, Patrick Rothfuss' debut, initially falls into all the tropes of the fantasy epic that turns so many people away and makes readers give it a ten or twenty page attempt and then give up: it is the first in the Kingkiller Chronicles trilogy (the second, Wise Man's Fear is due out March, 2011); the hardcover edition weighs in at 662 pages; the book employs a framing device, recounting a long story that has already happened; the book begins in an inn with a farmer named Old Cobb.  And this book has gone on to become one of the more read fantasy books to be published in the last few years, gaining in popularity through bestseller status as well as word of mouth, to the point where the sequel has been overdue for over a year now, and the natives are becoming restless akin to the clamoring George R. R. Martin fans.  The key to The Name of the Wind is to stick with it and it eventually turns into a refreshingly new fantasy epic well worth reading.    Kvothe begins his story as a young boy in a family of musicians and soon reveals his incredible talent with the lute and singing, following in the family tradition.  While mastering these talents a member of the University joins the troop and begins teaching Kvothe a material and science based form of magic, as well as the secret of naming, creating a drive in Kvothe to discover the Name of the Wind.  At the same time, his father Arliden is composing a song about the Chandrian, a mythical race of evil beings who may or may not exist.  This is soon proven when the Chandrian find the troop and slaughter them all.  Kvothe is the only one to survive, hiding in the woods.    He spends his next three years eking out a living begging and scratching by on the streets of Tarbean, until his interest in magic and study is reignited once more by a storyteller.  Using his experience in bargaining and negotiating to survive, Kvothe gets himself into University where he leans all he can while trying to make enough money to cover the tuition by playing and singing.  It is while playing he is reunited with an old friend, Denna, who he is very taken with.  During his studies, he also begins research on the Chandrian to avenge the death of his parents.  The book comes to a close as Kvothe investigates a place of death and destruction where a wedding was abruptly brought to an end by the Chandrian, coming face to face with a drug-addicted dragon.    At the heart of The Name of the Wind are a lot of almost clichés one would expect with an epic fantasy novel, but at the same time there are a lot of new, refreshing and completely different ideas and plots.  The magic of this world - unlike that of say Harry Potter - is one of balance, based in science with quantities and a variety of materials; it is a type of magic that at times seems quite realistic and believable.  The world has familiar places but with unique situations and events involving some strong characters and unusual creatures that keep the reader interested.  By the end of the book, the reader has become quite attached to this world and its people, wanting more stories and tales from Kvothe the innkeeper, but alas they must wait until Wise Man's Fear, due March 2011, hopefully without delay.

1439107955|4.0|I am enjoying this book. It captures the struggle of man's aquiring knowledge of the disease known as Cancer. It is written by a young doctor who is compasionate and knowing. We are drawn in by a story of a teacher that is dianosed with the disease and we are transported in time to a history of causality and human foibles. Bring a dictionary, there is 'Med Speak' here; this is not a \\"Reader Digest Story\\" it more on par of a feature story found in the \\"New Yorker\\".
1401307450|5.0|Scar Tissue, by Anthony Kiedis, was a fantastic read from the first to last pages. It kept me gripped and wanting to know more the entire time. For those that follow the Red Hot Chili Peppers, this would be a great book to learn more about the band's singer.  For those who know nothing about the band, this would be just as great.  It is incredibly well written and tells the highs and lows of Anthony's life in a funny, touching, brutally honest manner. From the day he was born to his recent accounts in life, this New York Times bestseller is sure to be a great book for anyone who wants to know about a mans life for \\"pleasure and kicks\\" as time magazine said. It is a fabulous book and I have already recommended it to a few of my friends.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Time-tested formula - that's what Nicholas Sparks' novels has - somebody (male or female) escaping from something or someone, meeting another somebody whom he/she wouldn't think twice about, but eventually he/she would fall in love with; there would always be a villain, whom in the end will be subdued, if not die.  But really, even though the plot is basically the same, this formula is always a winner for me - I could not put the book down, wanting to know what will happen next; it's entertaining; it's touching; it always moves me to tears.  Some selling points for this novel:  (1) Sparks was very effective in portraying how the villain's mind works, and (2) I don't know about the others, but I was still a little bit surprised with the revelation at the end of this novel; it just made all of the pieces fit.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Let me get right to the point on this new album. The music is rich & deep, because you get an \\"Allstar\\", cast of backing musicians, playing all kinds of instruments, plus you get Gregg's Unique, \\"Deep & Rich Blues\\", vocals & B3 Organ Play. Also, this album was produced by the legendary \\"Roots Music\\", producer, T.Bone Burnett. He produced the soundtrack album for the movie \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\", which won Grammy Album of the year for 2001, and he certainly did a great job producing this album. This is definitely album oriented blues rock music.  The liner notes include a great introduction, written by Robert Gordon, Author of \\"Can't Be Satisfied: The Life and Times of Muddy Waters\\". He tells a wonderful  story about \\"The Floating Bridge\\", and how it saved a blind bluesman, who fell into a river. He also includes the comments: \\"that Gregg has created a modern pop sound from the guts of a thumping blues tradition.\\" \\"His blues are real, they are etched onto his wandering and curious soul.\\"  Some of the steller, backing musicians include: Doyle Bramhall II on lead guitar,  Jay Bellerose on drums, T.Bone Burnett on guitar, Mac Rebennack (Dr.John) on piano, plus others, including a horn section on some of the songs.  The \\"Devil has got my woman\\", was written by \\"Skip\\" James. \\"I Can't Be Satisfied\\" was written by Muddy Waters. \\"Please Accept My Love\\" was written by B.B.King, and \\"Checking on my Baby\\" was written by Otis Rush. All the other songs were written by lessor known, blues legends. Gregg & Warren Haynes wrote \\"Just Another Rider\\". So, you can tell, these songs come from true blues legends.  If you like blues rock, you'll love this one.
B003ES61EE|3.0|The brush is a brush and worked fine to remove dust. It didn't seem to have much static or other dust clinging properties; I had to physically move the dust off the lens with rapid swipes. But it worked OK.     The other side of the pen has two chamois-like pieces, both smaller than a dime. One is circular, the other triangular. Neither did anything to remove a fingerprint from my D40x lens nor did they have any effect on a smudge. I pressed as hard as I was willing to press for fear of damaging the lense coating and very little happened. I ended up using a cloth lense cleaner which worked just fine.    It is big enough, and ineffective enough, to not bother toting around.    As others mentioned, the packaging seemed a little excessive for this light plastic device, but it was easy to get to.
1591841666|3.0|2.75 stars. You do not need to purchase this book. It is full of assertions without evidence or, in many cases, explanation; you really shouldn't spend any money on it. There are some genuine pearls of wisdom; these bits are mostly common sense, cast in Godin's terms (which are colorful and entertaining). But on the whole it reads as if Godin wrote it on a Saturday afternoon and published it on Sunday, without having anyone else take a look at it. (A good editor would have asked, \\"So, how does one distinguish between a Dip and a Cul-de-Sac, without the benefit of hindsight? And, given the subtitle of this book, don't you feel you should explain this to the reader?\\") You don't need to have this book on your shelf or in your home. Take an hour, read it in the store, write down anything you find inspiring, then put it back.
030745455X|4.0|I needed this book; I and my stressful life reveled in its 720 pages of sharp, fast-paced, masterfully-crafted distraction.  I might even go so far as to say that this book was better than the first story in the trilogy.  RARE!  It hooked me, and I read it in about a day and a half.<br /><br />But in spite of the book's strengths (which are considerable), I have a few criticisms.  Here they are:<br /><br />1) The book started to cross the border into comic book territory, superhero stuff, and that risks turning me off:  Salander is the MOST brilliant, Blomqvist the MOST tenacious, the blond giant the BIGGEST and STRONGEST and MOST impervious, Zala the MOST mysterious.  The book would have been better served if these elements were toned down a bit.<br /><br />2) Dovetailing with the previous, I found it ludicrous when the blond hulk only shrugged curiously after being tased.  I could be wrong here, though: perhaps the author is correct in his assessment of the taser's lack of effect in this unusual case.  But he didn't convince me.<br /><br />3) Near the end the plot started overlapping a bit too much with Star Wars for my comfort.  I will hush now, however, to avoid leaking plot details.<br /><br />4) The only thing that made me seriously consider ditching the book was when Salander, age 25 or 26, started having sex with a 16-year-old male child.  To me that is sexual abuse of a child.  I felt differently about her after reading that.  Supposedly she's on a mission to root out (and destroy) people who sexually abuse children, yet she goes and does it herself.  Hypocritical.  And clueless author.<br /><br />5) At a certain point in the novel I started finding myself repulsed by Salander, and not just because of my previous criticism.  She started bordering on the disgusting, and lost the gentle, sympathetic edge she earned in the first book.  I guess there's only so much asocial, isolative, secretive, non-trusting, perverted, bitter, calculating, miserable, boundariless coldness I can take in a protagonist.<br /><br />All that said, however, I still plan to read the third book as soon as I get my hands on it.  The plot has me hooked, and I'm hoping Salander will redeem herself as a human being.l that said, however, I still plan to read the third book as soon as I get my hands on it.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|I will not say one word to spoil this movie.  This is quite possibly the greatest movie i have ever seen. This trumps even   Ab-Normal Beauty, which was my favorite all time movie until I saw this. When the movie reaches a point that seems you missed something important, and you may be lost, do not worry because it will come together. If you have a WTF moment when you finish i advise watching it over again. I would give this a million stars if it were possible
B002RVZV9K|5.0|\\"It Might Get Loud'' is a joyous celebration of rock n roll. It tells us what's behind the guitar solos that rock stadiums and music clubs -- the years, sometimes decades, of experimentation, collaboration and self-doubt. Of practicing over and over to find the sound that conveys precisely the emotions roiling inside a song. The documentary brings together three extraordinary guitarists -- Jimmy Page, the Edge and Jack White -- and lets them talk about their music for a good hour and a half.    I was entranced.     They are three very different men and very different artists. Page, of course, is rock royalty, and he's a regal presence here with his white mane and striking features. He's a low-key, gifted storyteller, who seems to light up when he plays his guitar. (Page is also one of the film's associate producers, which might explain why he comes off so well.) The Edge uses technology to perfect his sound -- the sound that makes U2 so unique. Even now, he confesses to moments of terrifying self-doubt. It's somehow reassuring to learn that the ultimate big-stadium rock band started out practicing, and floundering, in a little Irish classroom after school.    White is a tough man to like. He's edgy and tormented, pale and doughy -- Edward Scissorhands on a Snickers bar binge. But I came away admiring him anyway. He's on a single-minded quest to create music pure and true. He admits at one point that everything he does amounts to an attempt to produce something as honest and clean as bluesman Son House's gritty a cappella song \\"Grinnin' in Your Face.'' Sometimes he seems to be trying to rip the music right out of himself. The film's most unsettling moment is a shot of White blood-streaked guitar at the end of a performance.     If you want to hear about groupies and drugs, this isn't the film for you. You won't learn about Page's demons or even get any clarity about the murky relationship between Jack and Meg White. This is all about music. And thank God for that. Ina way, it's a rock tutorial. I came away eager to listen to The Jam, one of the punk era bands that inspired U2. And I was amazed I'd never heard of Link Wray, whose \\"Rumble'' is one bad-ass piece of rock n roll (as Page, the Edge and White agree) and who seems to have been about two decades ahead of his time, judging from the evidence here.

B003YWUTKM|2.0|This is a tough review to make. I really love David Gilmours work and I've always been a fan of select Orb music. I have listened to this CD 10 or more times and I just don't get it. I'd give the first 5 minutes 5 stars and the first 10 minutes 4 stars but after those first minutes the music loses me completely try I as might to enjoy it. If you're a Gilmour fan and want to hear a great riff buy it and love the beginning but the Orb took the rest of it and they went WAY out there into cacophony land. Orb has made some wonderful music in the past, Plateau, Wonderful Day etc. but this gets away from them and that's too bad because it could have been great.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|My friends and I (usually 5+) have had game night on a regular basis on Fridays for the past few years and it would mainly consist of party board games, but this year (2010-2011) we started playing this game. It is such a great game. What starts out as a slow resource building game, quickly turns into a bitter trade for resources and cutthroat strategy for positioning. There will be yelling (we always have it, no matter the game) and lots of fun. Instruction manual makes learning the rules much more daunting than it is. If someone has played before just have them explain the basics and start playing. Definitely would recommend for any person or group that plays games regularly.

I was particularly impressed by how she handled the various male and female voices--and especially those of the children.
0060254920|5.0|Where the Wild Things Are is a good read aloud book for young children, Pre-K through 3. Second and third graders should be able to read most if not all of the book without help. The pictures are phenomenal and interesting to look at for any age; Sendak uses pictures in a wonderful way to convey the events of the story even without words. As for the plot itself, I love the way Max uses his imagination, whether he is dreaming or not, to turn his room into a land of adventure. My mother read this too me as a child and, I distinctly remember wanting to turn my room into a jungle afterward.
1594202842|5.0|I'm married to a tiger mom (albeit less demanding than Amy) and had my 12-year-old son read the Wall Street Journal article the day it came out.  It really helps us both understand this perspective.  It won't work on every kid but works pretty well on mine. The book is much more nuanced than the articles about it would have you believe.  I know her dad, who is even more brilliant and famous than she says he is.  For anybody who knows Leon Chua this book is a particular treat.<br />The author sparks an interesting debate: Does our culture overindulge our kids, selling their potential short, in a misplaced attempt to nurture their \\"self-esteem\\"?  Will our kids be happier if we push them to develop an advantage that will benefit them throughout life, instead of letting them squander years when their learning capabilities are maximal?<br />My take on this is that her kids are lucky to be in a dual-culture family because it is a perfect fit for the multicultural nation we live in.  They would lose something to have no tiger mom, but the tiger mom philosophy doesn't fit perfectly with our culture's valuation of independence and freedom.  Amy found this out the hard way, as she points out.  (The book, by the way, reads like a warts-and-all portrait but, reading between the lines, she makes it clear by the end that she is indeed holding back a bit.  There's a family negotiation process regarding what makes it in.)  It is implicit that she regrets not letting her kids have more free time with their now deceased grandmother, and her sister's cancer seems to have helped her take the long view and appreciate her daughters as individuals rather than extensions of her own ambitions.  But her family is replete with generations of hard-charging, hypercompetitive, ambitious achievers.  There's no way she's going to let this go.<br />This book is about paying the price (in time, money, and emotions) for success.  It has certainly improved my perspective on parenting to read this book, both for the parts where I agree and those where I don't.  I'm never going to forget this book, probably will reread it, and certainly will encourage my family and friends to do so.or the parts where I agree and those where I don't.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|I was skeptical as Haedes when it came out, and to be honest, I don't watch Heroes and all that so I didn't know who Zachary Quinto was.  I loved how Kirk was played by Chris Pine (and by the young boy who totalled the car in the beginning)! I think it totally rocked to see some futuristic kid driving like a maniac to the Beastie Boys!  Then of course you have the interaction with Spock/Kirk at the academy which Pine and Quinto did an excellent job on! That barfight totally cracked me up also.<br /><br />I will admit I was highly upset that Ben Cross didn't get more good reviews and better recognition for his portrayal of Sarek in the film and I hope he gets to reprise the role! Like the late Mark Leonard, he was simply excellent!  His interaction with both young Spock and Quinto's character was both moving and convincing.  I say that because even though Vulcans do NOT show emotion, Sarek explains that their emotions run even more deeply than humans and that is why they must control them.  When Spock unleashes his fury on Kirk, it is Sarek who gets him to stop.  Even with a face showing no emotion, it is obvious that the Sarek character had a deep love for his son and for the mother of his child, which is revealed later. There are some things that can be read between the lines and I simply love how Cross pulled this off with a straight face and calm voice no matter what was going on.<br /><br />Like Ben Cross, another actor deserves a heck of a lot more recognition here and that was Bruce Greenwood! He totally rocked too! You didn't know much about Pike from the original series because there was a guy in a chair with no speaking role or anything so I am grateful that Abrams gave this character dignity and depth! It also gives the audience insight into the relationship between a young James Kirk, and the man he looked up to with the utmost respect. I will watch this movie again, I assure you! I guess I judge actors by an older standard, but this cast far exceeded that standard--especially Pine, Quinto, Cross and Greenwood and I would love to see all four re-cast! I'll go to the theater for that--but if they don't use ALL FOUR--I'll wait for the bloody dvd and I DO mean it!<br /><br />Then you have the problem with the bad guy (Eric Bana's \\"Nemo\\")...Oh yeah...The one trying to destroy Spock--past and present form.  In the present Leonard Nimoy reprises his role as an older Spock, which was so cool!  However Eric Bana was the total bad a** bomb!  I hope he gets more bad guy roles out of this because he was simply awesome.  I wonder how many of these older actors realize though that being labelled bad a** is a very high compliment?  I've watched a lot of Ben Cross's work and that actor is also BAD A** in many roles!  God I hope he gets more work over here!cially Pine, Quinto, Cross and Greenwood and I would love to see all four re-cast! I'll go to the theater for that--but if they don't use ALL FOUR--I'll wait for the bloody dvd and I DO mean it!      Then you have the problem with the bad guy (Eric Bana's \\"Nemo\\")...Oh yeah...The one trying to destroy Spock--past and present form.  In the present Leonard Nimoy reprises his role as an older Spock, which was so cool!  However Eric Bana was the total bad a** bomb!  I hope he gets more bad guy roles out of this because he was simply awesome.  I wonder how many of these older actors realize though that being labelled bad a** is a very high compliment?

B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I got this for my wife, a real Harry Potter fan.  The wand and it's case are first class, not cheesey.  The instructions are written on a parchment paper that is not easily torn, and looks like vintage Harry Potter.  Well thought out and again, first class.    Just like Harry, she has to practice to get all of the various commands to work properly, and, it's something no other friend or family member has.  Cudos for me!    I give this product and the vendor 5 stars.  We love it.
1594488916|3.0|Generally I'm a sucker for books about books, so I expected to like this more than I actually did. But, although Allison Hoover Bartlett writes well, she never quite managed to convince me that this book was anything other than a magazine article that got out of hand. John Charles Gilkey, the serial book thief at the center of the story, is not completely dull, but he's not as interesting as the author seems to believe and certainly not interesting enough to warrant a 250+ page book. I think that the time and energy Bartlett spent in researching the topic caused her to overestimate its general appeal. She's not the first non-fiction writer to fall into that particular trap, and I'm sure she won't be the last.<br /><br />(A tip to all non-fiction authors: IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU. If you notice that you are starting to a take a prominent role in the story, it's a dead giveaway that your story may be getting away from you. In olden days there was this priesthood of people known as editors who would step in and point this out to you, to save you from yourself. Sadly, this kind of editor (intelligent, engaged, firm) appears to have gone extinct, so let me say this explicitly here. If you're writing non-fiction, please stay out of the picture. Repeatedly insinuating yourself into the narrative will not make me like you more - instead it's likely to reduce the quality of your reporting and irritate the hell out of most readers. So, unless you're Richard Feynman, resist the temptation to make yourself a character in the narrative. We all have a boundless need to be liked; please don't pander to yours by gatecrashing your narrative). Allison Hoover Bartlett's failure to resist this temptation weakens this book significantly, though not fatally.<br /><br />The failure of the book to ignite my interest stems from something that was essentially beyond the author's control. The problem is that John Charles Gilkey's kleptomania is the only faintly interesting thing about him, and it's not as fascinating as you might think. According to the jacket blurb, \\"Gilkey steals for love -- the love of books\\". This is accurate, strictly speaking, but it's also highly misleading. His obsession centers only on books as status objects and has nothing whatever to do with their intellectual content or with the joy of reading. He could just as well have focused his energy on stealing collectible paperweights. Or Pez dispensers. The realization that Gilkey steals books, not because he wants to read them, but because he thinks they will enhance his status, is ultimately what made this book fall flat for me. Despite Bartlett's borderline obsession with her subject, for me the book amounted to little more than a meandering account of the petty misdeeds of a small-time, singularly uncharismatic, drifter. When the account eventually just petered out, it came as a relief.<br /><br />I'm making it sound worse than it is. Bartlett writes fluidly and the story is not completely without interest. It was just far less interesting than I'd expected.ing as you might think. According to the jacket blurb, \\"Gilkey steals for love -- the love of books\\".

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|All 3 books are great reading. I actually struggled after a few chapters of book #1 because it started a bit slow....I set the book down for several months and had to reread sections because of all the characters. BUT then the book's pace picked up and I quickly finished that book, then read #2 and #3 in just two days. I appreciated that this book was slightly different than the first two. My only advice is that, once you start book 2, you should have #3 on hand!

As a Chinese American immigrant I read many passages in the book with knowing chuckle. We raised our kids with the same high expctation but less intensity than Amy Chua's. They turn out to be responsible adults and are successful. But we are not without regret: perhaps we should have pushed them to play piano or violine harder?  For America's next generation as a whole may be somewhere in the middle is better: keep learning fun but do apply a healthy dose of expectation and discipline.    CW, Delware

Hands Down an Album for the century.
0525951652|2.0|This book would have been much better had it been half the length.  The book is essentially the story of one affair after another with a little of World War I thrown in as background.  It is more afternoon soap opera and less fictionalized history.  Oh, yes, and it is way, way too long with far too little action.  Thoroughly boring reading.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|I started watching this with some concern.  I have seem so many detective type shows and am really sick of them.  But this show is different it has a great cast and the storylines are excellent.  I loved Season One and can't wait for Season two.  If you are not sure about this DVD then I think it is definitely worth purchasing it as you will not regret it.  I know with most shows like this i.e. The Mentalist the storylines are paper thin and you know within minutes who is responsible for the crime.  This is not the case here.  Do yourself a favour and try this DVD.
B003VBVQKS|5.0|I was in college when this came out and picked it up because I liked Coverdale's vocals.  I was a big Blackmore fan and was curious to see how Tommy Bolin would do as his replacement.  I loved it immediately but found myself in the minority some 35 years ago.  So it never got much play in my dorm room and I let the album go years later when cds became popular.  Big mistake!  This review is for the double vinyl re-issue which contains the same mixes as the cd reissue.  Since I let the vinyl go, I was compelled to replace it with vinyl when I found out is was available.  All I can say is that it is truly unbelievable and holds up incredibly well.  The liner notes are fabulous and both discs are worthy.  With Bolin dying shortly after its release, \\"Come Taste the Band\\" makes you long for what could have been had Bolin lived longer.  Oh well, we have this...and how sweet it is indeed.
1594202842|5.0|\\"CHINESE PARENTING IS AN INHERENTLY CLOSET PRACTICE,\\" Chua writes.  Chua dares to write about things that until now no one dares to talk about.  For me, reading Chua's book was like a cultural \\"coming out\\" experience.  Not just for the Chinese immigrants, but for all immigrants.  In reading the readers' comments, I am stunned by how many miss Chua's whole point about the IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCE.  They fail to recognize the parody and humor in Chua's voice.  They also fail to understand how words like \\"garbage\\" do not mean the same thing in different cultural contexts. It seems that for the Western reader, almost any commonly used expression in a Chinese (or other immigrant) family would be considered \\"abusive.\\"  In a time of globalization, Americans need to better understand not only different cultures, but how different cultures EXPRESS themselves in language.  Our friends who are Italian, Greek, Indian, and Somalian  tell us how common it is to say \\"Do you want to turn into a garbageman?\\" inside the home. Their kids do not find this abusive. Chua describes powerfully how all immigrant parents \\"learn to conceal things\\" because Americans do not understand the cultural context of their families.  As Chua puts it, \\"no one wants to be a pariah.\\"  It is so ironic how children (of any ethnic background) who study and work hard must learn to hide this from their American peers, for fear of being stigmatized. What does this say about the tolerance of this nation?  Chua's book, and the crazy reactions to her book, open our eyes to the huge cultural divisions (and intolerance) that still persist in this country.\\"
B0049OSQ18|5.0|For The Decemberists latest album, The King Is Dead, they have decided to turn to the good 'ol down home cookin' instruments of the south. As soon as I listened to the first track, I immediately noticed the resemblance between this and one of Colin Meloy's early groups, Tarkio. Tarkio was an alternative country and and have a compilation album called Omnibus that I would  highly recommend checking out if you enjoy this. Likewise, I would recommend any fans of Tarkio to check this album out.<br /><br />5 stars! Keep up the good work, Decemberists! I can't wait to hear what you guys put out next.

B004DK49DW|1.0|To all hard core Social D fan please be advised that in my personal opinion this is the weakest effort from Ness and Co that hes even been released.The song writing is weak Mike continues to rag on about the demons of his past in a very boring and mundane way.Maybe it's time that Mr Wickersham and the rest of the boys should have a whip around and get Mike a new rhyming dictionary,its almost ironic that the title of the album is hard times and nursery rhymes.Because personally I would rather read kids nursery rhymes than have to listen to this poor excuse of a release from one of my all time favorite bands.I know you can't please everyone but sorry folks this band has been pleasing me for almost 30 years until this stenchpile was released upon the world.For me the are only three high points on the album and whilst they ain't spectacular,I will take them none the less.First up track one Road Zombie is a pretty cool instrumental and sounds pretty much like what I would expect of a filler track on any good Social D record.Next we have the first single Machine Gun Blues track number 5 and while Mike make's no real progress in the lyric stakes at least this drives like a classic Social D song.Finally for me the only other track worth mentioning is the cover of Hank Williams classic Alone and Foresaken,which Mike had a crack at several years ago(more like a demo kinda thing)as it appeared as an obscure B side on one of the early Epic major Label E.P.s.Hardly new but nice to hear with a real drummer so now the song sounds fully realized to me and it is my favorite track on this release.Track 2 California Hustle and Flow is by far the lamest song on the release from it's poxy ACDC guitar tones right down to ACDC type riff's c'mon Mike, you're better than this man.Finally the last thorn in the side for this track is the quasi \\"black sounding\\" 70's type soul review female back-up vocals which also make an appearance on track 10.I'm sorry guys but who ever told you this would be a good idea on a Social D record must have had their drinks spiked.Well that\\"s about it for my nickels worth please if you care at all about this great band send them a clear message that they have to do better with the next release.Also opinions are like buttholes we all have one and this is mine please try not to judge me as too much of a douche bag as I really wanted to love this release as much as I have loved all the other previous releases but I have to call it like I see it and this is doggy doo.<br /><br />  gill zoom \\"old skool punk cretin\\"<br /><br />PS Social D finally play Sydney in March we have only had to wait 31 years yehaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!be a good idea on a Social D record must have had their drinks spiked.Well that\\"s about it for my nickels worth please if you care at all about this great band send them a clear message that they have to do better with the next release.Also opinions are like buttholes we all have one and this is mine please try not to judge me as too much of a douche bag as I really wanted to love this release as much as I have loved all the other previous releases but I have to call it like I see it and this is doggy doo.        gill zoom \\"old skool punk cretin\\"    PS Social D finally play Sydney in March we have only had to wait 31 years yehaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1607963027|1.0|This book appears to have been printed the day after I ordered it, according to a note on the last page of the text block (says it was \\"Made in the USA/Lexington, KY/January 14, 2011\\"). The illustrations are of horrible quality: they look like they've been through a photocopier 2 or 3 times - and the illustrations are an integral part of this book. details are lost in the poor print quality. the text does not say what translation of this story it is using. I question the legitimacy of this publisher -- \\"BN Publishing,\\" whose tagline on the back of this book reads \\"Improving People's Lifes.\\" If you cannot present your own slogan in proper English you should not be in the publishing industry. I didn't pay too much - 8 dollars or so - for this book, but I still feel taken for a ride.

Of course , this will not appeal to adults , but i still like it, and it is fun to watch.  This is from the same guy who did fireball xl5 , and joe90, and thunderbirds. To bad , they don't make this kind of programs anylonger...This is a great show , and you would not go wrong to get it for your family.
B003UCPEJ2|5.0|I have a huge collection of music- thousands of classical CDs and thousands of LPs. You'd think that a box set of core repertoire would be redundant for a collection like mine. But it isn't. This box isn't just a sampler of classical music, it's a retrospective of the work of Reiner and Munch, two of the greatest conductors who ever lived. The performances here are porterhouse steak at hamburger prices.<br /><br />But if you are one of the lucky people who have an interest in classical music but never knew where to start, this set is an even better bargain. This box cuts a huge swath right through the middle of the core repertoire. You know those lists you read online, \\"Recommended Basic Classical Music Collection\\"? Well, the contents of this set could function as that with no overlapping and very little chaffe.<br /><br />Symphonies, operas, programmatic music, solo recitals, it's all here in spectacular sound and definitive performances. Buy this box and spend the next year absorbing it all and you will gain a tremendous introduction to the world of classical music. This box could be priced four or five times higher and it would still be worth it. If you are new to classical music, don't hesitate. This is the one.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|From longtime devotee to well-done period drama: This film is a captivating story that has been thoughtfully arranged for the screen. I absolutely enjoyed every intense and pleasant bit of it alike and will look for more from this producer and these actors.     This is a story set in 19th century England, based on the classic novel by Elizabeth Gaskell. It is a story of a young woman, Miss Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe) and her parents who, although not wealthy, come from elegant society south of London. At the beginning of the film they relocate to the northern industrial town of Milton where cotton mills feed the town's population of poor workers and the wealthy and powerful families are those owning the mills. One such mill owner, Mr John Thornton, (Richard Armitage) first meets Miss Hale in a way that puts him in an unfavorable light which only time and Mr Thornton's honorable character can overcome. Miss Hale befriends a working family during this time and is torn between sides when unions clash with mill owners.     Beyond this, I will let you find out the rest for yourself. Buy this movie... I can't imagine anyone being disappointed!

B00005JMFQ|5.0|It took a few viewings, but Love Actually is one of my favorite films. Each story line is entertaining and well-developed, and the overall casting is absolutely impressive.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Mr. Lucas achieved no small feat when he created a myth that pervades modern social consciousness. Perhaps the special editions will be judged well by posterity, perhaps not. Observations from my household are this: in the last few years, my Star Wars viewings have essentially stopped. Correlated with this is the failure of my VCR, leaving access to the special editions only, versions that I don't enjoy as much. I'm saddened that I don't visit that galaxy far, far away as often as I used to, and that when the kids in my family come over and we watch a movie, it is never Star Wars anymore. As such, the power of Star Wars that I felt so keenly in childhood is not felt by my young family members. The transmission of the myth to the next generation has been interrupted, at least in my family. I could blame Mr. Lucas and be angry with him, but I remember the words of Yoda and Obiwan, and the example of a farm boy from Tatooine. I have no plan to buy any edition of Star Wars that does not include the original theatrical versions. Its as simple as that and its nothing worth getting angry over. As for the children in my family, there are other stories with fantastic people and high adventures I can share with them to impart the values important to me.

B003A4IFGY|3.0|I was a long time fan of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and to be honest, at one point, this was my favorite band.  That said, after Highway Companion and the Mudcrutch album, neither of which really clicked with me, I was really worried about this album.  It seemed that Petty and company were moving toward the more meandering side of their music, and producing more 'weird' songs instead of the earlier rock jams or the Wildflowers-esque contemplative numbers that I really liked.  And this was supposed to be an even more bluesy effort.      I bought this album the day it came out.  I listened to it three times, and I was astonished at how bad it was.  I mean, I seriously thought of selling it right then and there.  Aside from \\"Pirate's Cove\\" and \\"No Reason to Cry\\" I thought it was just a rambling pile of nothing.      I set it on a shelf, and I didn't touch it for about a month.  Then one day I was working out at the gym and I heard the chorus to \\"I should have known it\\" and it really sparked something with me.  I heard the hard rock and soft vocal element that I really liked in songs like 'Lost Children' or 'Saving Grace' that really got me excited about the later day Heartbreakers albums.  And then I discovered \\"Running Man's Bible\\" which is everything that I liked about the Last DJ and Highway Companion album rolled into a single song.      Of course, with the good comes the bad.  The lyrics and vocal delivery of \\"Candy\\" and \\"US 41\\" are annoying to me, \\"First Flash of Freedom\\" is long, slow and boring, and I don't even have the words to describe how much I dislike the opener \\"Jefferson Jericho Blues\\".  There's a good bit of filler material towards the end of the album, where the majority of the tracks are not particularly memorable.      For me, this album was the definition of a 'grower' - a CD that you might not be ready for if you're a long-time Tom Petty fan and you have some expectations about what this album should sound like.  If you approach it with an open mind, there is something to appreciate on this disc, although it wouldn't be the first album of his that I'd ever recommend to anyone.

Each episode is nearly an hour long (commercial-free) , and they run an hour including commercials on cable TV.  The service, shipping and convenience of choosing Amazon.com made it all the better for a busy mom!  The movie arrived quickly and in excellent condition. A little wrapping and it was the perfect gift!

193413712X|5.0|I read this once, totally enthralled, totally immersed. Re-reading pages, involved by this very special author's language, the simplicity of the random recollections of the protagonist's forebears, interspersed from time to time with little 'lapses' into his present day ebbing life.     I don't think there is any other book like this one. On the plane, reading it once again flying from Toronto back to London it slipped from my lap when I fell asleep. In the morning three of the cabin crew helped me search for it. But it was gone. I know who took it. It was the man who sat behind me. Is that not the meanest trick in the book, as it were?    I have re-ordered it just now - and just hope that it's the same edition, with the beautiful cover and the lovely rough-cut, high quality paper.

0679731725|4.0|(Alert! There will be spoiling! Read the book before this review!)<br /><br />This is a book about nothing. However, rather than addressing chocolate babke, made-up December holidays, sponge-worthiness, and the other minutiae that fuel neurotic Gothamite passions, \\"Remains of the Day\\" suggests a futility in all of life's actions. Stevens, a hard-working British butler living in the 1950s, borrows his master's vintage Ford to take an unprecedented vacation to the English countryside, an undertaking that frames Stevens' stories and reflections of his many years of service at Darlington Hall. Prior to his trip, Stevens receives a letter from Miss Kenton, the competent and kindly head housekeeper and the quintessential \\"one who got away,\\" twenty years prior, in order to become Mrs. Benn, and who is now planning a return visit. Stevens provides an unreliable first-person narrative, chock full of Freudian defense mechanisms regarding his decisions in life, or really lack of decision-making, as he tends to default to the inaction of maintaining a persistent physical busyness.<br /><br />Stevens begins his trip by expounding lengthily upon the amount of witty banter appropriate for an excellent butler, the attributes of particular great butlers of the past, the selection criteria for the Hayes Butler Society, how the concept of \\"dignity\\" is properly incorporated within a butler's career, and other topics that make it clear that he takes his job very, very seriously. Stevens had worked for years for Lord Darlington, a consummate gentleman and high ranking government official, who was closely involved in dealing with the Germany problem. However, ever since Darlington had died several years past, Stevens has served Mr. Farraday, an amiable and unfussy American, whose aw-shucks manner leads to Stevens' unacknowledged disappointment that with little expectation comes little pride in one's work.<br /><br />More deeply disturbing, however, are Stevens' memories of Lord Darlington, the cultivated gentleman who once orchestrated the fate of nations. Stevens showers his lordship with heaps of praise, yet occasionally hints at nationally acknowledged \\"mistakes\\" in Darlington's \\"certain path in life,\\" which \\"proved to be a misguided one.\\" It is unclear what these mistakes were, yet they seemingly related to favoring an early appeasement with Germany, partially due to Darlington's excessive trust in a particular German diplomat. And if Lord Darlington is busy making egregious errors that may have led to the death of millions, then certainly what is the purpose of insuring that his veneers are properly dusted?<br /><br />Stevens recalls an incident in which Darlington's posse of aristocrats, while discussing the preposterousness of the social milieu favoring an increasingly democratic decision making in world affairs, decide to inquire the butler on his opinions. They interrogate Stevens about the gold standard, Pierre Laval's speech concerning North Africa, and a proposed French-Bolshevik arms agreement. While Stevens has clearly been studying such topics, if only to master the art of servile repartee, he surprises himself by repeatedly responding with \\"I'm very sorry sir, but I am unable to be of assistance on this matter.\\" This hardy confirmation of their biases sparks laughter in the gentlemen, who subsequently compare the electoral system to asking \\"a committee of the mother's union to organize a war campaign.\\" Stevens doesn't know why he feigned ignorance , but one suspects that he hoped to please his earnest scrutinizers, as well as to further justify his role attending to the expert class. However, later Darlington ventures outside of the frames of the manor, and encounters cockney-class villagers near Tavistock, who nonetheless possess well-articulated opinions on world matters and assert that \\"dignity's something every man and woman in this country can strive for and get.\\" Stevens then surprises himself once again by pretending to be, not the butler, but the gentleman of the Darlington Manor.<br /><br />Apparently, there is no marrying in butlering, and Stevens' stubborn adherence to maintaining his pride in his job complicates his relationship with Miss Kenton, Stevens' better half, who refuses to fire the Jewish maids when Darlington takes on an anti-Semitic girlfriend for some time, and makes arbitrary decisions to which Stevens abides and rationalizes (but Darlington has tons of Jewish friends!!), in an episode presumably foreshadowing Darlington's later sucker status involving the German diplomat. Miss Kenton, sick of dropping hints to Stevens, with whom she spends all of her spare moments talking shop, finally decides to marry, albeit to a simpler, less beloved butler of whom she explains \\"does not mistreat her in any way.\\" Two decades later, after receiving her letter, Stevens speculates that perhaps Miss Kenton has divorced, and has returned to pick things up at work where they left off. Instead Miss Kenton explains how \\"year after year went by, there was a war,\\" her daughter grew up, and one day she realized that she \\"loved her husband.\\" Stevens, still obviously in love with Miss Kenton, yet harboring little capacity for self-acknowledged emotion nor authentic personal reflection, retreats to lengthily meditating on the skill o f bantering, and similarly attending to the remaining tasks of the day.of the Darlington Manor.

B0044KI7B6|5.0|I like the fact you don't know how sam got back and i like how the brothers roles have changed such as they have switched personalities. and the big theme so far this season is nobody knows what to make of sam. It seems like they are building up to a big ending for the season. And in between or during this new Sam, you have them still fighting the good fight against all kinds of creatures. not as much fighting or killing demons. I would like to see more of that. there are a lot of story lines they have to tie together before the season ends, like dean and his girlfriend, Lucifer, heaven vs hell, angels having lost faith, but the biggest story line that is going to be all season long and that is who is Sam? the humor is still there. I believe they have enough going on to keep us going and wondering what will happen with all these issues. I love the show. I have watched all the episodes..I have watched all the seasons.and this show has something in it for everyone. Start with Episode 1 and go forward. You will fall in love with it like millions of other people have.<br /><br />I also think its unique. if you like science Fiction and have an imagination this is a fantastic entertaining show. and i hope it has many more years to go. i wish i had watched it from the start. i never knew it existed. thank god for re runs. i wish they did more advertising for the show. but the cast is great and i also hope the angel Castillo , if i spelled it right, has more screen time. he is an important part of the show in my opinion. you just cant go wrong. buy it and enjoy it for what it is. its fun and the hour goes to fast. One of the best shows and series ever on tv. It has something for everyone.
0061743526|5.0|It's one of those books I always said I would read 'one day'.  I received it as a Christmas gift and I am so grateful I did!  What a wonderful read!  I know it's a classic that people have probably had to read at one point or another for a class, but if you're like me and have put it off, don't!
B002ZFQD0E|4.0|I saw this girl open up for Prince on December 29, 2010. I had NEVER heard of her but her show, energy AND VOICE were very commanding that night. She had the place rocking and very excited for Prince. Not one person was sitting down bored desperately waiting for Prince to save us from our misery. Janelle was AMAZING to say the least. The NEXT day I bought and downloaded the album. I was not disappointed. WHAT a voice! The way she can manipulate it to do the things that she does is beyond wonderful. From the jazzy rockwild Come Alive to the oh so beautiful Say You'll Go the girl shows magnificent range. While every song is not my favorite I figure with 12 to my liking out of 18 tracks (and two are interludes) I got MORE than what I bargained for. You can tell this girl has an appreciation of who has performed this art before her and is laying down a Fabulous blueprint for many to follow. TALENT TALENT TALENT!!!!! She's got MJ, Prince, Lena Horne, Katherine Hepburn, James Brown, Frank Sinatra, Queen, The Beetles and Stevie Wonder all throughout this album. Very refreshing not to hear what P. Diddy usually produces or throws at us like we are pigeons lurking for scraps. This is REAL Music no matter how futuristic some songs may be. This album set out to push boundaries and tell a story and with a voice that is so beautiful it makes you play songs over and over just see \\"how did she do that?\\" I'm a FAN now and wish this ARTIST the very best in her Long Long Long career.    Some great tracks (in no particular order) that dislpay her GREAT talents: Dance or Die, Faster, Locked Inside, Cold War, Oh Maker, Sir Greendown, Come Alive, Mushrooms & Roses, Neon Valley Street, Wondaland, Say You'll Go, BaBopByeYa (her voice is the sweetest thing here). Not to mention her outbreak single Tightrope.    An amazing album, well deserving of many accolades. Give it a listen, you won't regret it.
0545123275|5.0|What I Can Tell You:<br />I had heard about this book last year when Twilight Guy was billing it as Twilight for Wolves. I love Twilight and thought why not! Saturday I finally pulled it from the top of my To Be Read Pile!  Last night I finished it!<br />I prolonged the ending as much as I could just like I did with Breaking Dawn. I saw the end coming and didn't want it to happen, so I put the book down numerous times. The last page would bring the end of the story and I didn't want to let it go.<br /><br />I explained the book today to a friend. \\"It was billed as Twilight for Werewolves. It isn't like Twilight. In Twilight we have to accept the relationship Bella and Edward form. There is no big build up to their undying love. It just is! It was the only problem I had with Twilight. The relationship seemed juvenile because of how fast they loved each other.  This is not the case with Shiver. We understand why they love each other.  It is something we can see, feel and it doesn't feel silly.<br /><br />Grace is a strong girl! She is the anti-Bella. Her world doesn't come crashing down when she isn't with Sam.<br /><br />I love that Maggie gave us Sam and Grace's point of views by switching narrators.<br /><br />This book is a quick read and I couldn't put it down. I flew through it in two days (weekend home with two kids, laundry, life, and meals).<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater's writing is poetic, funny and charming. The characters, beside Grace's absent parents (Really people, there is a boy living in your daughter's bedroom for weeks and you have no idea?!) are interesting and likable.  Our main characters Grace and Sam, are sweet and lovable.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|i still haven't watched it completely yet cuz i keep falling asleep but this movie is awesomeee!..from last time that i watched it before this copy of my own.  eh on blue-ray since i don't get what the big fuss is about but wooo cuz this movie is great and with mucho action.
B002ZG98CS|4.0|What I Can Tell You:<br />If you are a big fan of movie fast action, guns, shooting, and blood, Machete is a must see!<br /><br />Machete came out of a fake trailer that was featured in Grindhouse and was a brain storm Robert Rodriguez had after meeting Trejo on the set of Desperado.<br /><br />As a fan of Robert Rodriguez movies, I knew I was going to love this movie. I remember Danny Trejo from two of my favorite movies, From Dusk Till Dawn with George Clooney and Desperado with Antonio Bandaras.  I really was excited to see this when it was in the theater. Unfortunately, I never got there but thanks to 20th Century Fox, I was able to review the DVD which was released early this month.<br /><br />Machete, played by Danny Trejo is a Mexican Federale who is on a mission to rescue a kidnapped girl. He is set up and watched his wife and daughter murdered while he is left for dead. Fast forward 3 years and he is laying low, looking for honest work when he is offered a suitcase full of money by Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey) to kill a Senator played by Robert De Niro. It's a set up to show that this illegal immigrant is trying to assassinate the Senator.  He is taken to a Network hospital. U.S. Immigration and Enforcement Agent Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba) is sent to retrieve the injured Machete.<br /><br />With the help of Luz (Michelle Rodriquez) and his priest brother played by Cheech of Cheech and Chong, Machete seeks revenge on Booth.  After much death, machete throwing, making out, and recovery scenes, Machete rides into the sunset with one of the chicks on his bike (not telling which one).<br /><br />Only in a movie by Robert Rodriquez could a guy who looks like Danny Trejo make out with Lindsey Lohan (yup she is in there too), Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodiguez, and Alicia Marek.<br /><br />Great movie if you like this kind of thing and I do. Spent most of the move fight scenes going \\"ahhhh\\" \\"ohhhh\\" \\"damnnnn\\".  Fun, and a big cast: Don Johnson, Steven Seagal also have roles in this bloody revenge movie.
B003U6Z7IG|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

B0049OSQ18|4.0|I had a lot of reservations as I listened to \\"The King is Dead,\\" the Decemberists' \\"back to their roots\\" album -- the kind of countryish, simple music that they were trying to get back to is just something that usually bores me. Fortunately, it turned out to be far more intriguing than I expected, forming a golden tapestry of energetic folksy melodies.<br /><br />\\"Here we come to a turning of the season,/witness to the arc towards the sun,\\" Colin Meloy announces over a bed of twangy acoustic guitar and harmonica. \\"Don't carry it all, don't carry it all/we are all our hands in holders/beneath this bold and brilliant sun/this I swear to all, this I swear to all...\\"<br /><br />That folksy Americana sound sets the mood for the rest of the album: the speedy country-rocker \\"Calamity Song,\\" the mellow bluesy ballads like \\"January Hymn,\\" fiddle-driven dance tunes, cluttered twangy rockers like \\"Down By The Water,\\" the gritty tight rocker \\"This Is Why We Fight\\" (although the opening section made me think of the \\"Tremors\\" theme song), and the languidly sunny finale \\"Dear Avery.\\"<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that Colin Meloy and the other Decemberists are pretty passionate fans of Americana, folk and country-inspired music. It oozes from this album. It drips from this album. \\"The King is Dead\\" feels like one long homage to that kind of music, and you can't mistake the love that is woven into these songs.<br /><br />In fact, that is the biggest stumbling block in this album: it feels like a loving homage, not a natural musical expression of the Decemberists themselves. The music is a dusty, golden-hued blend of acoustic guitars, harmonicas, fiddles and other folksy instruments, and the Decemberists carry them off smoothly and skillfully. It's good music, but it just doesn't feel natural.<br /><br />Fortunately, Colin Meloy's nasal voice twists itself easily into a heartfelt twang, and he weaves himself through the songs as naturally as another classic folk-rock instrument. And the lyrics are filled with the sort of sentiments you find in such songs -- they evoke summertime in the American countryside, with winding rivers, countrysides filled with flowers, mines and other such things.<br /><br />The folk/country slant doesn't quite show the Decemberists off at their best, but \\"The King is Dead\\" is still a strong, enthusiastic homage to a simpler king of music.rt of sentiments you find in such songs -- they evoke summertime in the American countryside, with winding rivers, countrysides filled with flowers, mines and other such things.

030746363X|1.0|I bought two copies of this book because I wanted the bonuses that were promised to those who did this.     Since then I have not received the bonuses in spite of numerous emails to the person who was supposed to send them out I will try again to get the bonuses but may have to give up as I don't want to waste more time on this.   Naturally I won't be buying from the people involved again unless I at least get one reply from them.     The book looks good but it will be some time before I read it. I have given one copy to some friends but have not heard what they think of it so far.     Sorry I cannot be more helpful     Best wishes     John Watson

B004AHNIGM|4.0|Gregg Allman's voice and keyboard playing fit the blues songs on Low Country Blues like a hand fitting into a glove (not the OJ kind) -- it's a smooth and natural thing.  Besides Gregg's intuitive grasp of blues music, another big part of the success of this album is the strong supporting cast.  In particular, T-Bone Burnett's production and Doyle Bramhall II's guitar work are tremendous.  Burnett's work is something I've come to appreciate more and more over the years, and Bram-II reels off some truly sweet and tangy riffs throughout the record.  Everything comes together wonderfully on such hot numbers as \\"Little By Little\\" and \\"I Can't Be Satisfied.\\"  And once the horns come in on \\"Blind Man\\" and Gregg starts to sing with that growl in his voice, it's really something to hear!  The only thing that stops me from going the 5-star route with this album is that the pace seems to drop off a little too often, as on \\"Devil Got My Woman\\" and \\"Tears Tears Tears.\\"  When those songs were playing, my mind wandered.  It's the same problem I've had with some of Eric Clapton's blues records.

B003YCI1O8|4.0|This blu-ray disc has a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack that sounded awesome on my sound system. The criticism about the picture quality was not apparent to me, but I'm much more an audiophile than videophile. That being said, I had no problems with the video on this disc that I thought I would and thoroughly enjoyed watching this film on blu-ray.     Back to the sound...Wow! When the creature is tunneling and making loud yells/noises, you definitely feel it rumbling the floor. Explosions and the signature elephant gun are also sonic beauty for an aged movie like this one! Pick this up now, don't be detracted by the bad reviews!    PICTURE: 7/10 (Sure it wasn't perfect, or like the newer movies look, but it was not nearly as bad as I thought it might be by reading others' reviews. Actually it was rather detailed I thought and looked great. It's still a high definition picture after all. At least it wasn't DNR'ed to death, that's when grain is digitally removed and people start to look like wax figures.)    SOUND: 8/10 (For a movie from 1990, this is pretty damn good.)    This blu-ray has not been approved by the FDA, but HAS been approved by Dr. Blood. Buy now!
0385341679|5.0|Not all the questions get answered and there's definitely a room for more books set in the same world. But the fifth book in the Fever series is definitely worth the eager anticipation and anxious waiting of all the Moning Maniacs!
0385341679|5.0|This book was very hard to review without spoiling anything. I can honestly say it was the most engrossing book I have ever read. From the beginning, until the very last words I was completely sucked in. In fact, I actually cried while reading the very first chapter, it was that emotional in such a short amount of time. All of the pressing issues are solved and the questions are answered. Only one major question remained at the end of the book, but the answer was something Mac decided she didn't really need to know. I don't have a problem with this as a little mystery makes things much more interesting in the end.<br /><br />Mac is thoroughly tested over and over in this book, but just as she has in the past, she survives, she endures, and somehow comes out the other side stronger. She has grown so much from the girl that stepped off the plane, yet somehow never once lost who she really was at the core, despite being pulled in so many different directions. I understand now why everyone believed she only had a slim chance of choosing the \\"good\\" side of the prophecy. The odds against her were almost insurmountable, and a lesser person would have failed where she persevered. I truly admire her, and her willingness to stand up for what she believes in. I don't think a better person could have been picked for the fate of the world to rest on. Oh, and just as a little side note, she does finally kiss a man that she can't breathe without, and finds that breath is of little consequence. As far as who that man is, well you will just have to read Shadowfever yourself to find out. ;)<br /><br />I'll admit, as much as I wanted this book, I also was a little hesitant to read it. I wasn't sure how just one book could tie up all of the issues and leave me with a sense of happiness and satisfaction. I am very happy to say that I was wrong and that I should never have doubted the author. The book was every bit as good as the predecessors and left me more than satisfied. Many times after reading a final book in a series I will feel almost hollow and just generally disappointed. Not because the book was bad, but because I just didn't feel any satisfaction in the ending or knowing that I was saying goodbye to the characters. With Shadowfever, this just is not the case at all. The ending is everything it should be, leaving me happy and content, an absolutely rare feat in any final book.<br /><br />I would highly suggest not reading this book if you haven't read the first four. You need that foundation to give this one the justice it deserves.  As the Author promised, it is a story about light, not darkness. However, as they say, the night is always darkest before the dawn and that definitely is the case with Shadowfever. Be prepared for one heck of a roller coaster ride full of countless emotions that will leave you reeling, and desperate to know what happens next. If I could rate this higher than a \\"five,\\" trust me, I would. I hope everyone enjoys Mac's final trials in life, love, and war as much as I did. My hat goes off to the author for this amazing world she created and the awesome cast of characters. Bravo!inal book in a series I will feel almost hollow and just generally disappointed.

030746363X|3.0|I'm a fan of Tim's first book, The Four Hour Work Week, so this book seemed like a winner.  I'll have to give my honest opinion so here it is:  \\"The 4-Hour Body\\" by Timothy Ferris: A bit long in the tooth, somewhat borderline on scandalous in that he recommends one thing in an early chapter, then later on in the book he recommends the exact opposite.     Of course, if you are trying to lose weight, a different approach is needed to increase your Bench Press.  I did learn some things, but the book read like he was rushing through each chapter.      If I were to separate the purpose of the book (or purposes) he should have written 2 or 3 books and kept it sane.    Too much for one book and at the same time most of it was evidence that he experimented with.  He included (in some chapters) statistical data but when the stats didn't match what he wanted them to he just used his own experience as a justification.    Also knowing that he outsources all his research to people in India (as he did for his first book) - I am skeptical of most of what he reports now.  I'm sure he got paid a lot of money to write a second book, though.

B00003CXC7|5.0|Hitchcock is becoming a treasured family evening activity in our house.  We have more than a dozen of his films in our collection, which draw us in for a forget-the-world experience of suspense and drama.  OK, the characters are not necessarily all that deep, but there is a engaging quality to the films that is a magic all its own.<br /><br />Because of the static setting of the film, this is one of the last ones we watched.  It starts slow, with a relationship that is fraught with tension:  Grace Kelly wants Jimmy Stewart, but he is holding back - because she is too perfect, he says, but also because he fears a basic incompatibility.  She is a fashion and social goddess, he a news mag photographer who is convalescing after an injury sustained by standing in the middle of a race track.  She wants him to stay in NYC and take up fashion photography, where they can go to the finest places, he doubts she would want to give up that world and travel to the jungles of Asia with him.  Kelly, who is absolutely stunning in her prime and reeks of NYC sophistication, is wooing him, the doubter, the pursued one.  With a hip cast, all he has to do is watch his neighbors, quite a roster of characters.<br /><br />THere is Raymond Burr in an unhappy marriage, lonely women, and a newlywed couple, who are active behind closed shades all the time (though the new husband shows signs of reluctance and fatigue.)  It is a wonderful social observation of a happening neighborhood, The Village.  Soon, he observes what he thinks is strange, and has trouble convincing Kelly, a detective pal, and his nurse that something is really going on.  However, with so many signs, Kelly begins to participate, in a way to prove to him that she is not what he thinks she is.  An adventure, largely just observed by Stewart from his room, ensues that builds to a frightening climax.  If ever you doubt that Hitchcock has a certain genius, you have to experience this.  There are also flashes of humor and sexual innuendo.<br /><br />There are also excellent critical reviews and documentaries of the restored version, which add to the excellence of this dvd.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  Hitchcock is perhaps the only \\"old\\" film director that my kids consistently love.nuendo.<br /><br />There are also excellent critical reviews and documentaries of the restored version, which add to the excellence of this dvd.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.

B004DK49DW|4.0|First off, let's get things straight-Mike Ness is going on 50 years old, his music has grown and matured with him. I'm sick of reading reviews that say they aren't \\"punk\\" anymore, or have \\"lost their edge\\". Social D, from 1988's \\"Prison Bound\\" on up, have been, and always will be a ROCK & ROLL band with very few peers. About half of these songs have been in and out of Social D's setlists for years now, so some may be turned off that this is not all \\"new\\" material, but for the rest of us, it's finally good to hear these songs layed down in the studio. I'll do a brief song-by-song rundown...    Road Zombie-I've seen this song played live multiple times, always as the opener, and for a good reason. It really gets you ready for what's in store. It's an instrumental track with a driving riff, and some great leads by Mike.    California(Hustle & Flow)-A classic rock & roll riff, background gospel singers, not the best lyrics Ness has ever written, but a good song overall.    Gimme the Sweet and Lowdown-Classic SD. Sounds like it could have been on Sex, Love, & Rock n' Roll.    Diamond in the Rough-Probably my personal favorite track on the album. Ness speaks from the heart. Brent and Johnny's background vocals in the chorus are beautiful and top-notch. One of Ness's finest vocal performances ever.    Machine Gun Blues-Pretty self-explanatory. A song with that badass of a title, could be nothing less than...well, badass.    Bakersfield-Another personal favorite. They have been playing this live for a few years. A beautiful song about being away from your girl, and hoping that things are ok when you return to her. The spoken word part is a bit corny and could have been left out of the studio version(with perhaps an extended solo in its place), but it's still one of the best tracks on the album.    Far Side of Nowhere-Perfect song to start your day off with. Starts out with a hook that'll be stuck in your head for days. A happy, simple little song.    Alone and Forsaken-Thiswas already released years ago, but this version is more refined. A great Hank cover. They really nailed that \\"dark\\" feeling.    Writing on the Wall-A slow, sweet song. Very well put together.    Can't Take it With You-Chugging guitar, piano solo, Ness shreds on guitar, more gospel singers, great lyrics. One of the best.    Still alive-Another one that sounds like it could have been on Sex, Love, & Rock n' Roll. Once again, lyrics are a bit corny, but a great way to end the album.    Overall, Great album. Has a few cheesy moments where it seems like Ness tries juust a tad too hard to sound tough, which we already know he is. A very refreshing rock & roll record, which is EXACTLY what the music industry needs right now. Too bad it won't get the attention it deserves. Well worth the long wait. This is right behind White Light, White Heat, White Trash and Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell in my opinion. And that says alot.
0439023521|4.0|Katniss Everdeen, a resident of post-apocalyptic Appalachia, volunteers to take her little sister's place in a government mandated fight to the death. Readers new to this genre will probably think this is one of the best books they have ever read.  The link with reality television shows certainly gives it an immediacy that other books of this type lack, but I doubt it will become a classic.<br /><br />Why? I have been struggling to write a coherent review of the book because Katniss, the narrator, is so shut-down emotionally it is hard to feel a connection to her. I think readers will remember the action sequences but will not be as deeply attached as they are to other strong teen protagonists like Menolly in [[ASIN:0689860080 Dragonsong (Harper Hall Trilogy)]] or Romilly in [[ASIN:0879977620 Hawkmistress! (Darkover: The Hundred Kingdoms)]].<br /><br />Small quibbles about the plot aside, it is a very good read that will doubtless become a hit movie.

B004IB28RK|5.0|How does T-Bone manage to pull the best out of musicians and produce quality music?  Gregg's voice is a perfect fit for all of these songs.  T-Bone has gathered some great musicians, including Dr. John and Doyle Bramhall, II. Otis Rush' \\"Checking On My Baby\\" may be my favorite.  Slow, down-home, blues.  All the tracks are excellent. This is a blues CD, for sure.  Enjoy!

Unlikely as it seems, even the supposedly steamy parts could only be described as tepid, and I found myself wondering on several occasions why the character would even consider doing or saying some of the things they do and say in the story.<br /><br />Also, and please bear in mind that this is my first attempt at an audio book, I was wondering why they would use a male narrator when most of the speaking/thinking/arguing/shouting/crying/pouting is done by women.  The narrator, to his credit, is extremely consistent with his various voices, and you can easily tell which character is speaking throughout the arduous journey, not that you'd actually care after the first few CDs.<br /><br />Nineteen CDs worth of my life, totally wasted.  SO not recommended.<br /><br />Amanda Richards<br />January 18, 2011

B002ZG99A4|5.0|Being a child of the 80's I like many others grew up watching some of the great action movies from the 70's and 80's.  This movie had the potential to be great and to be a bomb.  With so many great actors doing what they do best, a well written script and surprisingly good story - this rates as one of the best action movies I have seen in a long time.    Like the great action movies from the past - this has excellent action, good quotable one liners and a pretty good story that wraps up nicely.  Hopefully we see more movies of this quality from Stalone and the crew.
B00000JR29|5.0|One of the best albums that came out in the 1980's was Tears For Fears' \\"Songs From the Big Chair\\". TFF was like many other English bands in the early 80's who depended upon a highly synthesized sound that centered on self-pity and whining as their central lyrical themes. But in 1985 the band decided to adopt a harder edge and bigger sound than their debut record \\"The Hurting\\". The songs were still sometimes brooding in nature but there is enough positivity to go around making it a very engaging record. The opening track is \\"Shout\\" which I'm certain most people born after 1980 would recognize. It's followed by my favorite lesser known song on the record; \\"The Working Hour\\". This song features some fine saxophone work and that big drum sound but it's really a showcase for what a fantastic singer Roland Orzabal was back then. He sings with a range and power that very few vocalists then or now could boast. That talent shows itself again on \\"Head Over Heels\\" which was another hit from the album. But the real show stopper here is the irresistible \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" which could quite possibly be one of the best and most uplifting songs written in the past twenty five years. This record has no duds on it and the original eight song 1983 release is, in my mind, one of the finest albums of the 1980's.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|\\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" is still one of the most reaffirming, encouraging, and overall warm fuzzy movies of all time.  George Bailey reminds us that we should count our blessings and realize the impact we make on those around us...Plus, it's just a great family movie.
B000069HJN|4.0|It's 1985 and one of the band's primary songwriters and vocalists has left to pursue other interests. This is the situation facing Supertramp when Roger Hodgson parts ways with them. He was responsible for many of the groups best-loved songs including \\"Dreamer\\", \\"Give a Little\\", \\"School\\" and \\"The Logical Song\\". His tenor was a great contrast to Rick Davis and this combination made Supertramps songs more interesting with the alternating leads and harmonies. His songs tended to be different subject matter than Davis and that too created a more varied sound and approach when it came to making music. When Supertramp went on to record \\"Brother Where You Bound?\\" they must have known that Hodgson's void would be impossible to completely fill. But, this is a very admirable attempt and for this one record they were able to almost pull it off (make you not notice that Hodgson was missing, that is). \\"Brother\\" is not \\"Crime of the Century\\" or \\"Breakfast in America\\" so if you are looking for an introduction to the band; one or both of those two albums should be where you go. But, if you like the earlier work I don't think you'll be disappointed with this record.  I'm reviewing the re-mastered 2002 edition and the first thing I notice is the superb sound quality of the disc. \\"Cannonball\\" is the lead track and I would say it's the strongest song on the album. \\"No In-between\\" sounds like a classic Supertramp song while the albums centerpiece is undoubtedly the title track which logs in at 16:30 minutes. It's not the best epic length song I've ever heard but it's good. I still prefer \\"Fool's Overture\\" but this one features some great instrumentals including Pink Floyd's David Gilmour on a searing guitar solo near the mid-point. The song is separated into three distinct parts and this helps it maintain its length without getting boring.  Supertramp were never able to put together an album that is this good again and even though it's not their best I believe it's probably one of the best 100 rock albums of the 1980's.

I have upset the apple cart. If only I hadn't met you in my loo that night and gone thru that damned magical door!\\"<br /><br />- Elizabeth: \\"But, Miss Price, I had thought this your fondest prospect, to escape the ennui of your modern-day existence and so inhabit that of your most beloved book.\\"<br /><br />- Amanda: \\"Bob's your uncle, Lizzie. May I call you Lizzie? Too soon? Okay. To answer, Miss Bennet, I very much fear I shan't ever get the hang of it, living in the Georgian era, talking couth, behaving with grace and decorum. I'm all out of sorts, y'see, and color me envious. I see you, on the other hand, have adapted quite well to my 21st Century. I've always reckoned you were a girl ahead of her time, Miss Bennet, and I was right. Cor, is that your mobile?\\"<br /><br />- Elizabeth: \\"I confess I exceedingly favor your London and its remarkable advances, Miss Price. And, yes, this is indeed my mobile. Kindly pardon me as I perform a rash of these text messages. There, a round of LOLs to all. And yet believe me when I say, Miss Price, that you retain my utmost attention with regards to your unfortunate plight. Pray, say on.\\"<br /><br />- Amanda: \\"Well, I've well and truly bollocksed it up, y'see. It's smack-dabbed in the middle of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice I've landed in, except that the plot's now gone completely off the rails, and it's all to do with my crass blunders and cluelessness and lack of proper elocution. The other night, Mr. Bingley, in avowing Mr. Darcy's utter disdain for dancing, stated that \\"Mr Darcy regards all forms of sudden locomotion as a mark of ill breeding.\\" Oh, the wonderful language. I am rendered awestruck at the ease with which elegantly couched diction trips off these characters' tongues. It's bloody brilliant. I've read Pride & Prejudice so many times, I thought I'd fit in quite seamlessly. It turns out, I'm completely at sea, Miss Bennet, with your era two hundred years a-gone. But the dramatis personae are not whom I thought they were. And, most unfortuitous of all, Miss Bennet, Mr. Darcy, that elegant, prideful man you were destined to marry has fallen for someone else... because you're not here, y'see? And poor Mr. Bingley! The poor gentleman has resolutely taken to drink. Oh, I wish we had not swapped places! I make a poor substitute for you, Miss Bennet.\\"<br /><br />- Elizabeth: \\"My dear Miss Price, you do yourself a great disservice. Surely the state of affairs could not be so horrid. But I profess, I do not know this Mr. Bingley of whom you are lamenting. As for your Mr. Darcy, I also have not had the pleasure of meeting the grand gentleman. And yet, oh, your declaration of my marital prospect does fill me with perturbation. Do you believe my dear Papa would think it amiss if I were to once more consider a protracted turn in your contemporary London? In your bustling world, Miss Price, I feel... unconfined.\\"<br /><br />- Amanda: \\"Oh, that's right, duh. We swapped places just when Austen's story was starting. And your presence is sorely marked by its absence. Tell me, Miss Bennet, do you know who Colin Firth is? He looks a bit like Mr. Darcy.\\"<br /><br />- Elizabeth: \\"Yes, I have seen Mr. Firth admirably ensconced in - what do you call those? - ah, moving pictures, and regard his countenance as most pleasing and not without an air of nobility. Sir Laurence Olivier is another whose not unhandsome features I have glimpsed in your cinema. I cannot believe that your Mr. Darcy is in any form superior to these two inestimable persons.\\"<br /><br />- Amanda: \\"Whatever. My biggest concern, Miss Bennet, is that I am simply not you, everyone's beloved and timeless heroine! How will people accept me? By standards of the Georgian period, I am not fit for polite company. I evidence indelicate manners and demonstrate lewd and vulgar conduct, a modern girl utterly out of her element. Oh, the subversiveness of it. I mean, I got caught smoking a ciggy!

B002ZG99QS|5.0|I really enjoyed this sequel to the original Tron.  I also loved the fact that they included the original actors Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxlighter.  There was a lot of action stunts and CGI, with light cycles, cars, flying devices, etc.  A Disney flick, this 2010 release begins in the year 1989 and is approximately 2 hours long.  Bridges/Flynn, who built the Tron gaming system, is talking to his 7 year old son/Kevin.  Flynn disappears that night, leaving Kevin alone.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2009.  Kevin is now 27 and quite wealthy.  He chooses to not participate in the business (ENCOM Company).  Bruce Boxleitner/Alan is still around.  While the board is preparing for a press release on a new product, Kevin sneaks in and hacks into the system because his father would have wanted the software to be available to all.<br /><br />Shortly after, Kevin enters his father's workshop, dives into the system, and accesses the grid.  The adventure begins here as Users and Programmers meet and the games begin.  The light up suits are really neat looking and everyone wears a disc on their back.  The disc is their weapon and it carries all their knowledge.  The light cycles and other transportation devices are too cool, along with the light-up suits and the competition games.  As always, there is a general good guy vs. bad guy theme.  Kevin also finds his father on the grid and the young gaming Bridges wants the knowledge in the disc the old Bridges has.  There is also a young Boxlighter on the grid.<br /><br />I recently read an article that stated the movie's cost at approximately $170 million dollars! Los Angeles visual f/x house \\"Digital Domain\\" used the latest 3D cameras and motion-capture technology to create the younger version of Bridges.  They captured Bridges' facial movements and then transferred the CG version of Bridges onto another actor.  They then fine-tuned hair, eyes, etc.  French electronic duo Daft Punk created the soundtrack.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed the movie and was pleased at the sequel as a real continuation.he sequel as a real continuation.

B003ASLJS6|5.0|Pale Rider has often been described as cross between Shane and High Plains Drifter.  At one level, this is a very apt description.  But it fails to account for the fact that Shane is hideously annoying and reeks of the 1950's, and that High Plains Drifter is slow, rambling, random, and senseless.    In contrast, Pale Rider is magical, satisfying, engaging, delightful, and perfectly-paced all the way through.  The visuals are perfect, too.  Boulder Mtn, in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, was the perfect location for this movie.    My only criticism of Pale Rider is the technically inaccurate depiction of mining that the tinpanners were engaged in.  In contrast, the supernatural angle was perfectly handled with precisely the right degree of ambiguity.    This movie is Shane done right.  After seeing Pale Rider, Shane looks utterly rinky-dink.

B004B8DH98|1.0|I'm usually a fan of most George Clooney films, but this movie was terrible!  Very Slow, for a movie about an assasin.  It never really came together to make any sense!  Never really tied in any of the other characters and to how/why they were involved.
B001HYX1XQ|5.0|John Steinbeck's classic novella \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" a tale of struggle during the Great Depression, follows the unlikely twosome of cynical George Milton and simpleton Lennie Small.  The pair's friendship and dependency appears to be dichotomous, but in my opinion it could be argued that either a greater friend or more dependent on the other.  Because of Lennie's fondness for petting soft things and getting in trouble, the pair travel from Weed, California to Soledad in order to make their dream of living off the fat of the land come true.  Amidst wonderfully described and unique characters, the story of their friendship is superimposed atop various other friendship-themed sub-stories.<br /><br />Much like Steinbeck's usage of dreams throughout the novella, the selection of Gary Sinise as reader is a dream for any listener.  His style, tone, and delivery is no less impeccable than what would be expected from an actor so talented and diverse.  He conveys the lonely nature of many of the characters, the pervasive desperation of the times.<br /><br />Regardless of criticisms about language and/or questionable material there is no denying the powerful themes in \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" nor is there any doubt of its status in the pantheon classics.  Given Sinise's dedication to the source material - he was also in the movie - there is no doubt his rendition amplifies the inherently powerful tones.  With a running time of somewhere just over three hours, this is a perfect story to get lost in, to immerse yourself in a simpler time, while on a long weekend drive through rolling, sun-drenched wheat fields.<br /><br />Jason Elin

0553381687|5.0|I have finished reading the first three books of this series (A Song of Ice and Fire), of which A Game of Thrones is the first, and thought I would put some reflections down.<br />Thematically or plot-wise I wouldn't call any of the volumes so far a stand alone novel, I see them as three sections in one very very large novel, so this is a work in progress. The good news is that it is very readable and so far G R R Martin has shown incredible control over gradually revealing the plot, the back story and the mysteries underpinning the fantasy world he has created. The effect is that the overarching story advances like the inexorable turning of a great wheel, but remains gripping chapter by chapter.<br />Every chapter is told from the point of view of a different character, and is like a short story that advances that character in some critical way and/or our understanding of what is going on.  It is easy to become attached to a number of characters which makes reading the books very \\"moreish\\"  - I constantly find myself wanting to read \\"just one more\\" chapter.<br /><br />The setting, particularly since the first three books are in war time, reminds me of a Rutger Hauer film I once saw called Flesh and Blood.  The culture is mostly unrepentantly harsh and the characters are shaped by the world they live in. A number of the point of view characters are children, or else have a somewhat more compassionate approach to things than their society, so part of what is at stake for me reading is how much these characters will have to change to survive and whether it is even possible for some one to \\"win\\" in such a way that there is hope for a less brutal world, assuming into the bargain that the supernatural threat indicated in the prologue can be dealt with...  I wouldn't cast bets on anything at this stage.<br />There can be fine line in fantasy fiction between magic and indulgent wish fulfillment to arrange things to suit the reader. Initially there is little magic in this series, and that fits with the authorial approach - on those occasions when Martin gives the reader something they want (including magic to make something happen) it really really  pays off because of all the times when one's hopes for a better outcome over some plot point are dashed.<br />So it's often grim - but it's great, and will be a truly remarkable work in or out of the fantasy genre if sustained to the end.fits with the authorial approach - on those occasions when Martin gives the reader something they want (including magic to make something happen) it really really  pays off because of all the times when one's hopes for a better outcome over some plot point are dashed.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|First, this my favorite set of movies ever, and above all, the original Episode IV is my all time favorite, though is been a diferent story than to others. For me the original is not the edited for TV shown every christmas, although I do like it, but the one a saw 50 kilometers from home in a theater still under construction. They showed the movie before other cinemas in the area. I don't know why, or how, but it included an scene before the last battle where Luke encounter his friend Biggs. Could not see this again until the special edition. So yes, i like the special edition, not just because of the special effects but for the recovered scenes.    I do have to say that on Return of the Jedi that and alternate angle feature with the original \\"spirits\\" scene(main) and the new one(alternate) would be nice, even so, if the new one has not only the younger Anakin, but also the younger Obi-Wan and Yoda. Just a thought, but even with this variation, this and the rest of the movies still are so good that they can be avoided by any Star Wars fan. The original Star Wars changed my way of looking at the movies, and so has the rest of the saga that even today they cannot receive less that **********, even though here I can only give them 5.
B002NXOQF2|4.0|One of the classics I missed as a child. Great story, but it sometimes gets bogged down in the descriptions of the landscape. Still, it is definitely worth reading.

B004IAR4Q6|5.0|this album is for 'real blues lovers.'  gregg has been through the mill and considering, he sounds great.  this album is seasoned 'revival' 'ol blues to perfection.  brushes resemble the hissing of an authentic old record album.  while this release excludes 'the allman bros band' (warren, derek, butch & the guys) who i can never get enough of, this masterpiece includes specialized horns, keyboards & slides by exceptional artists.  this superior cd (g. allman at his finest) rates five stars but i'm partial.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|This is a great collection of songs. I know he is an integral part of Floyd but you can easily identify his solo work from Floyd's work. He writes beautiful uplifting music that has an underlying positive vibe. When with floyd this colaberation of his positive uplifting vibe mixed with Waters dark and brooding side made for some of the best recordings in musical history. Thankfully, when he went solo we get treated with nothing but positive uplifting music. There's no dementia rocking back in forth in a straight jacket as often depicted by Waters. I have all of the solo albums now of both artists and I find myself always going back to Gilmore. He makes my brain feel good.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I first tried this workout when it was added to my ondemand menu with comcast. I have become skeptical of Jillian because it seems as if she just attaches her name to any product...i.e. her diet pills, any trainer/nutrition expert will tell you diet pills don't work and aren't safe.     However the release date (2008) of this video is before she really started digging for cash.      This is a killer workout, I have been doing the EA Active workouts and was getting bored, and Jillians routine involves a lot of combo moves which saves time (ex: lunges with bicep curl)  And the intermittent cardio keeps your body moving.     Don't fall victim to the 20 lbs in 30 days claim as this is not possible.  You can safely lose 1-2 lbs a week, and honestly if you are overweight and lose 20lbs in a month, imagine how much excess skin you will have.
0061537969|4.0|From the back cover:  Have you ever looked at a dog and wondered whether there might be more to him than meets the eye? Well, Enzo knows he's different from other dogs. True, he hasn't got opposable thumbs, and yes, he still thinks you can't beat chasing birds once in a while, but Enzo is almost human. Through listening to the words of his master, race driver Denny Swift, Enzo has gained a real insight into the complex world of people. With its unexpected twists and turns, he sees that life, like racing, isn't simply about going fast. On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his beloved family have been through. He remembers the sacrifices that Denny has made, the painful loss of Denny's wife Eve, and the trauma of the battle to retain custody of their daughter Zoe from her manipulative grandparents. As Enzo heads into the light, hoping fervently to return as a smooth-skinned man, he knows that for him at least, the race to save his family has been won.    Review:  If you've ever been loved by a dog, you'll know that Enzo's narration is spot on. Garth Stein seems to have some kind of preternatural ability to take the looks, groans, grunts, growls, snorts, huffs, whines, pushes, nudges and snuggles that dogs do and turn them into exactly what you think your dog is thinking. There are some really heavy themes covered in this story, denial of signs and symptoms of a terrible disease, false accusations of sexual assault, the loss of a child to manipulative grandparents and the inability to achieve dreams because of responsibilities. But viewed through the eyes of Enzo, they are easier to read about and are seen through a veil of compassion and steadfast loyalty.    At times the story telling becomes a little bit sentimental, but it manages to avoid becoming a kind of saccharine Disney tale.     And yes, I cried at the end.    I recommend this book as a gentle read, one that will leave some part of your superstitious mind looking around for traces of your best four legged friends who've passed over.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I'm not exactly a fan of superhero flicks. And I wasn't into thrillers either until I saw this movie. But I think \\"The Dark Knight\\" struck a chord in me. The three major reasons why:<br /><br />1. The Dark Knight keeps you at the edge of your seat when you watch it for the first time. There are so many surprises as the story rapidly changes scene to scene that you want to stay focused on the screen--something that'll happen when you watch many of Christopher Nolan's other movies as well.<br /><br />2. Heath Ledger's last performance may have been his best. The Joker is \\"a psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy\\" in the words of Ledger himself. Basically, he is the ultimate villain, and you will probably hate him with all your might as you watch this film.<br /><br />3. The soundtrack is perfect. It intensified the already suspenseful scenes, and it really helped you get into the movie if you already weren't. Listening to the soundtrack afterwards makes me nostalgic for the scenes.<br /><br />Of course this film doesn't have everything. We don't really know why the Joker is murdering left and right aside from his obvious psychological problems. Many of the characters are a bit \\"stiff\\", and people might not find them charming. However, I think the way these characters behave, and the fact that we don't know everything about them is appropriate for the mood set in the movie.
B001GZ6QEC|2.0|What I liked:    1)Heath Ledger  2)SOME of the action sequences  3)The Score  4)Rachel Dawes' Death    What I didn't like:    1)The editing and camera-It felt like they cut a 3+ hour movie down to just under 2 hours and 40 minutes and on top of that some of the action sequences and shots could have been better edited and shot.  2)The third act plateaus  3)The ending is terrible and doesn't make sense  4)Rachel Dawes-I hated this character, she was poorly written in begins and it carries on here.  5)Two Face/Harvey Dent is under developed and makes a 180 too quickly.  6)Things don't make sense such as Batman and his girlfriend survive a fall on a car, Rachel says the best place to hide is the SAME penthouse where she was attacked, a cop stands INSIDE the interrogation room with an uncuffed joker...I can go on...  7)Batman...his voice, performance and writing...  8)The writing in general is pretentious, and is handing me the script with the characters analyzing/talking about everything...  9)The cell phone device was an awful and aggravating plot device  10)The boat scene is ALSO just plain awful and aggravating.  11)Watching Chicago rather than Gotham, seriously, where was the atmosphere from Begins?  12)No Bat Cave
0634022296|4.0|I just bought the kindle version of this book.  Somehow, I noticed that one of the Beatles song 'Till There Was You' is not there.  The book's title has the word 'Complete' so I'm assuming that all the Beatle song is there.  Anyone noticed this and/or any other song missing?  One other thing, I noticed that the index is somewhat not consistent in format.  It's a minor thing but it should be easily fixable from the publisher.  I'm not trying to complain too much for a ~$14 purchase.    I'm simply just trying to point out some of the quirks and am hoping that they will be fixed thru an update.  --SonnyD
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was an interesting book. I am 23 so I guess I would still be considered a young adult, but this booked lacked the childish narration that is sometimes present in some of the typical \\"young adult\\" novels. I had just finished Unbroken which was another amazing WW2 story of survival and going right into this one, I felt almost totally immersed. The narrator is Death, which I'm sure you have realized is a very unique point of view. I LOVED how this book was written however. I loved the images that I got from it, the almost gothic feel to some of the scenes and I LOVED how real the characters are. They are people in every sense of the word and I really feel like I really got to know them throughout the book. After finishing I just can't stop thinking about the characters. About life and how strange it is the way things turn out sometimes. I loved the imagination of the author in taking this spin on things and I keep looking for people to recommend this book to. I got the Kindle version but I'm thinking about getting a paperback version also so I can pass it around to family, friends and coworkers. The night I finished this book I had tears running down my face and I was haunted by it as I tried to go to sleep that night. I know I will read it again.
1439102813|5.0|So many of us base a huge measure of our self-worth on our careers and spend so much of our time trying to get better and better at what we do that when/if we don't have our jobs to focus on any more, we feel lost and useless.<br /><br />That is what happens with Alice Howland, a tenured professor at Harvard University when she is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimers Disease.  She is in her early 50's, extremely well respected in her field, by her fellow staff members, by her children, and especially by her husband.  And then she starts losing that piece of herself and other pieces.  This book tells the tale of how she deals with these overwhelming losses and also how those around her do, too.<br /><br />Alzheimers Disease and other forms of dementia are heartbreaking - for the person with the disease and everyone around them.  Many members of my family and my husband's family have been afflicted.  It is terrible to watch people you love so much just start to fade away, piece by piece.<br /><br />This book is spot-on in the descriptions of different steps that happen and it is one of the best books I have ever read.  It was extremely difficult to read this book because it brought back so many memories but it is a book everyone should read because at one time or another everyone knows someone with this terrible disease in one form or another.
B0034G4OVS|3.0|In typical \\"what would you do\\" fashion, this movie puts you in the lives of three teenagers who go skiing for the day. Of course what would the movie be if they just went and had a great time together? Upon their last ascent to the top, there is confusion and the lift is stopped. Being Sunday night, the hill is closed until the following weekend.<br /><br />This is not a bad movie, but fails to deliver true emotion and hopelessness that movies such as \\"Open Water\\" have done successfully. It does stay interesting for the most part and is worth one view rather than a \\"must own\\" category. It also adds the element of dangerous wildlife to the mix, but I will let you see how that plays into everything. A good 3 star movie.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I'm not going to go into a play by play detail of the movie. There are plenty of them out there. In my opinion, the movie was outstanding. It was so much better than what you would expect upon seeing the advertisements. So if you had planned on not seeing the movie because of the advertisements or you just don't dig on \\"kid movies\\" I suggest you throw those thoughts out the window and watch the movie and judge for yourself. It has a lot of action, of course, but it also has a lot of heart. Plus, if you're a fan of excellent animation, MegaMind is above the curve in that department. Such expressive facial features and body movements, little details that would be easy to forget or overlook, you realize add so much richness to the experience. As for the storyline, it had a lot of heart. You feel for the characters. There's a realness to them! And the music! This movie has a phenomenal soundtrack. The music covers a range of music types from artists like Ozzy, AC/DC, Guns n' Roses, Michael Jackson, Elvis, ELO, Gilbert O'Sullivan, Minnie Riperton, and George Thorogood and the Destroyers. Plus, the original score is really really good too.     When I was sitting in the theatre, not knowing what to expect, hoping it would be good, anticipating it would be just another CG kids' movie, I discovered within the first 10 minutes or so that this movie was going to be good. I went back 4 additional times to see it in the theatre after that. I absolutely cannot get enough of this movie. So it being released with a bonus episode, that is just thrilling for me. A little extra MegaMind! Gotta get my fix!

B002ZIAC26|4.0|I'd heard the name Beach House since their last album came out and always meant to pick something up from them. I read enough reviews in the press to know I'd like it. I rarely get something new unheard anymore, but this is why it's good to take a chance sometimes. Probably one of my favorite new bands of the past couple years (for me), along with Fleet Foxes and Black Mountain. To give them a genre label, I'd say dream-pop nails it. It's very lush and warm. Good for headphones or just staring out the window to. Her voice matches the mood of the music well. Great lyrics. The DVD is something to see once, twice at most. It's interesting, but nothing special. I'll end my review just as the album ends, by saying Take Care.

B000JIHP88|4.0|I watched this item for months waiting for a  sale... finally found a one-day sale at walmart where i bought it for $17 (online).    the sound is very soft, but still enjoyable for baby.    The dual motion of the spinning animals and opening/closing leaves is very stimulating for baby. At 5 months, he still loves it. Of course, it has never soothed him to sleep - perhaps because it is so stimulating.    Also good to note - this is a very heavy (and top heavy) mobile. I find it places some pressure on the side of my (Davinci Emily) crib. This is not a good mobile for a portable crib, like a pack-and-play.    Smelled a little chemical-ly when I opened it... but that smell went away.    At first, one of the leaves was too stiff and stayed in place while the others moved... I would manually move it in time with teh others and after a few days it loosened up... I assume that flaw was just a fluke... most people dont seem to have that problem, but if you do - thats how I fixed it.    It is easy to take on and off the crib - as it has a screw back - but I think it kind of scratches the crib when I take it on and off... and the MDB crib does scratch sometimes.    Colors are very bright, cheerful and visible to baby. Animals are plush and very cute.    The product instructions say not to use past 5 months... we have - but will take off after baby pushes up on hands and feet.    Good to know that this converts to a crib music/light box after the baby is too old for the mobile. Music is soft and not annoying. There are three settings - night light (where the lower body of the mobile lights up) lights + mobile, or just mobile.    Quite a large, bulky mobile but baby loves it. Music lasts 18 minutes - just enough time for mommy to take care of one thing around the house! My active child cannot be fascinated by it much longer than that... For longer playtimes, we go with the Baby Einstein play mat.

B0049OSQ18|4.0|The Decemberists follow up their ambitious theathrical CD \\"Hazards Of Love\\" with the more rootsy \\"The King Is Dead\\". REM's Peter Buck helps out on guitar, while country songstress Gillian Welch closely harmonises with vocalist Colin Meloy, giving a more laid back, homely sound.<br /><br />\\"Don't Carry It All\\" opens the 10 track CD with a wall of harmonica. Similar is the upbeat REM-channeling \\"Down By The Water\\". \\"Rise To Me\\" is a melancholic ballad, while the jaunty \\"Rox In A Box\\" tells the tale of a Montana mining community.<br /><br />\\"January Hymn\\" is a tender acoustic ballad\\" as are \\"June Hymn\\" and the mournful \\"Dear Avery\\" (the latter with haunting guitars and strings). Highlight though has got to be the groovy \\"This Is Why We Fight\\" with chiming and jangly guitars which reminds me a wee bit of The Smiths.<br /><br />\\"The king is dead\\" finds The Decemberists going back to basics. A crowning achievement!
B004DMAZQK|4.0|UK trio White Lies return with their sophomore album \\"Ritual\\", which is more of the dark angular synth Rock of their debut. If you liked the upbeat Dance/Rock of \\"Farewell To The Fairground\\" or swelling atmospheric ballad \\"Nothing To give\\", there's more here.<br /><br />The upbeat \\"Is Love\\" opens the album on a spartan beat before full instruments kick in at about the one and a half minute mark. The frenetic rocker \\"Strangers\\" follows (\\"I've got a sense of urgency\\" sings lead singer Harry McVeigh in his ominous baritone). \\"Bigger Than Us\\" is a pulsing rocker, while the atmospheric \\"Peace & Quiet\\" brings down the tempo somewhat. The dark \\"Turn The Bells\\" is another ballad with shimmery synths.<br /><br />Religious imagery creeps into lyrics on songs like the Depeche Mode-channeling \\"Holy Ghost\\", the ballad \\"The Power & The Glory\\", and my favourite song the mid paced \\"Bad Love\\" (\\"I've been going to Church but I don't believe, I'll ever be clear of this pain \\" - with crunchy guitars over a funereal beat). Closing is the synth ballad \\"Come Down\\" (with McVeigh channeling Brandon Flowers).<br /><br />If you like Interpol or Editors, this should be right up your alley.

If you are a fan of Calvin & Hobbes, & lament the too early passing of the strip [I applaud Bill Watterson's desire to end the strip before it lost its spark [think \\"Peanuts\\" post Woodstock] but still feel anguish at the lost opportunity for more expression of his wit & wisdom!] then you will want this.    If you are not a fan of Calvin & Hobbes, well, you obviously haven't read the strip yet, so you'll probably want this eventually too! ;D    Be forewarned: this comprehensive compendium was published with an eye toward the preservation of Watterson's genius as ART - consequently, these books weigh a LOT, since the paper is \\"slick,\\" high-reflectivity baryta-base stock. Quality stuff, folks, and well worth the high price Amazon is asking: you can't compare the cost of just buying all the individual C&H \\"treasure trove\\" editions with this, since they weren't published to the same high standard as the presentation in this set.    One thing you will notice if you've read the earlier C&H books: the comics as presented here will seem out of order. That's because they were first published out of order in the earlier books: the order of presentation in this encyclopedia of Calvin & Hobbes is supposed to be the correct one, by date of publication in the original strip.    My sweetheart bought this set for me for a present for Christmas 2010, and I can honestly say I have not been as delighted with a Christmas present since I was a small child! So, sooo happy to finally have ALL of Calvin & Hobbes to treasure & share with my friends!

030746363X|4.0|I first came to know of Tim Ferris via Wired.  I was certainly skeptical that this book would include too much I didn't already know, or about the book having the best information buried in pseudo science dreck. What I found was that, when the information or data surrounding a concept was questionable, Ferris called it out as such and gave possible explanations as to why the results did or didn't meet expectations, the ramifications of those unexpected findings on a given topic, and what some possible interpretations of the results might mean.  It isn't the Journal of Such-and-such, but that really isn't Ferris' intent.  A large portion of the information is also found (but not collected) elsewhere, but generally the writing is very accessible, and there is a bit of humor not often found in fitness/bodybuilding circles.  Also, the book really isn't a get in shape program.  What it does provide, however, are a few ideas, or modifications of ideas related (mostly) to fitness to help the reader move up to the next level, make a change, or just try something new.  The book clearly exceeded my expectations and I give it a solid recommendation.  As a side note, I showed the book to a few physical therapy professionals, physicians and others in the health industry.  While they echoed the \\"not Journal of ..\\" statement, above, they also found the information to be generally correct and accessible for relatively lay readers, the people for whom the text was intended.  Good job, Tim.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|The first time I listened to Josh Groban, his music wrapped around me, enfolded me, enthralled me, and I could not understand a word as most of it was in different languages, but the music spoke to me.  This man has a voice with a range and depth that most do not.  Sadly he is not using his God given tallent to his fullest as he is trying out new styles, which he has a right to.  I'll just have to wait and watch him evolve, grow, into what he feels is right for him.  I hope it has some of his original, enigmatic, soul moving style that made me want to float and dance to his music as if I were a prima ballerina.  I never tire listening to his first CD's and his Christmas CD is a joy to listen to as well.  I must say that I bought this CD with my eyes wide open.  I had questioned friends, asking them if they thought that the quality would be there after so many years between CD's.  They all said w/o a doubt that ANYTHING Josh Groban would put out would be of great quality.  Unfortunately that niggling doubt became a reality as I purchased it w/o reviewing it and I feel it was a waste of my money, but more than that, a dash of my hopes.  I gave it a 2 star rating as there are 2 songs on that CD worth listening to, but unfortunately the others just don't ring true to his capacity, a mock of what he can do with his voice, it feels as if he is trying to find himself, blaze a trail, when in truth that young man has all it takes if he would just sing from his heart, full throttle, cut out the falsetto and the dipthongy type carying out of notes that make me cringe.  It takes skill to sing a song as the writer intended, anyone can fool around with tempo and notes, but few do better than the writer himself intended.  When a song is sung as it was meant to be, the performer gives due respect to that writer and shows real skill.  I am still a fan, but a cautious fan.  Too many years in between with too many T-shirts and coffee mugs sold felt like a stall, but I'm not sure whathe was stalling for.  He will always have a loyal following, but I know that when a certain note or creshendo makes me shudder that it is just \\"wrong\\", and unfortunately there are many moments on this CD.  Sorry folks.  I'd have liked to have given him 5 stars, I'd have really liked to recieve a CD worthy of those 5 stars.  Maybe next time.  Do you think he will wait 6 years again?  Sometimes a 6 year wait is rewarded with a masterpiece well worth waiting for, but this is not one of those times... :(
B000PMLFRA|2.0|I have to agree with the consensus here. I want the original theatrical releases, especially the original Star Wars VI A New Hope. I fell in love with that movie when it first came out, and I don't want the silly new version with all the CGI stuff, and the conversation with Jaba's henchman is re-performed outside the bar with Han and Jaba himself. It's just silly to have that scene twice, with almost the exact same dialogue, just so they can say \\"look, we stuck Jaba in the original movie!!\\" So what? Let the blue ray set with the CGI enhancements stand, but also release blu ray versions of the original theatrical releases of the first three movies.
0060936223|5.0|I wont go in depth about the content of this book (Hardcover edition), others have covered that well. However, I will say I found this book thoroughly enjoyable and finished it in just two sittings. This is not like me to devote that much attention to one book, disregarding all the other reading I have to do each day. It does sound cliché, but it is true that I could not put this book down.    It was a highly enjoyable look into a New York I will never know, and into the lives of two artists who I knew only through the work they created. The prose flowed through beauty and ugliness with equal ease, keeping my attention through every page and chapter.
030746363X|5.0|Review title says it all. The book came in 2 or 3 days. Started reading and implementing the chapters right away.
0385341679|5.0|To all other authors out there: take note.  This is how you tell a story!  I spent the whole day reading this and then woke up in the middle of the night still thinking about it.  Karen has ended her series brilliantly.  She didn't miss a beat and I am more than satisfied, I am full.  I can't wait to reread!
B0013N3DSE|4.0|Very good picture but no so good sound,<br />I d'nt notice there is a sound treatment on it, now a day there are<br />a lot of digital technics for reberding a new sound aspect, the image thanks to technicolor system ys very<br />good for me (I'm 70) this  is the best version of the film, good scenarios, good lighting technics and<br />a very appropriate team of actors, the only issue that d'nt matches the quality of the whole film is sound quality.

B003NFM3JU|1.0|I don't know how disney could screw p a christmas carol!  All they had to do was copy it, they left out key ingredients to bore us with flying characters & buildings.  I guess they thought people would be to busy in the theaters going wow to the 3-D, and forget they sacrificed story lines.  One glaring example was when the ghost of christmas past was showing him his past, they left out the death of Scrooge's sister & how he screwed over Mr. Fezziwig (hope I spelled it correctly).  All that happened in his past was he was left at school over christmas & his fiance' dumped him.  There are better christmas carols out there.  Skip this one!
B001BPJJ9G|3.0|This was a beautiful film to look at.  Tarsem's work is visually stunning, and looking at the previews I was excited as to what an awesome film this must be.  I felt like maybe it could be another \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\", but mixed with the visuals of \\"The Cell\\". I was dissapointed because it definitely wasn't that. I loved some aspects of the movie but really disliked others.  The real life story of Alexandria and Roy is tender and heartfelt, but when we delve into the fantasy world the story becomes a bit two dimensional.  I wanted to love the characters Roy created in his story, but most of them were not very fleshed out and at times the acting was really hokey and wooden.  The story was even unintentionally silly at times, like it was almost a fairytale for children and not adults.  It was a flawless and lovely world for the eyes, but the subplot wasn't enought to be a cohesive tale that transcends into the flawed, real world.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|This was one of the worst boosk ever chosen by Oprah's Book Club.  Truth is, I've read several books she has recommended and found most of them depressing, either racially or politically charged, and almost always dealing in some way with death.  This was the worst one.  In fact, none of the people I know who tried to read it could stand it and most didn't finish it - throwing it away.  If I want someone's political view, I'll read a book from a politician.  If you want to be depressed, go ahead, read it.  I would not waste my time again.  And, yes, I'm done with recommendations from Oprah.  Her taste in books leaves much to be desired.
0679746048|4.0|Girl, Interrupted, by Susanna Kaysen<br /><br /> This memoir is a relation of Ms. Kaysen's 2 year stay in a medium security psychiatric ward in the late 60s. It describes her living conditions and her co-patients in vivid detail. It even contains pages from her official file (which she had to use a lawyer to obtain).<br /><br /> Most of the time, she seems like a perfectly normal teenage girl. But every once in a while she does things that seem...not quite right. Given that it's the late 1960s, it comes as no surprise that she gets institutionalized for such behavior. Even if it took place today, there wouldn't be a large outcry of surprise; some of it is pretty dang deviant!<br /><br /> But either way, this book borders on being a classic; it's got a lot of good philosophy in there, and it makes you think quite a bit, but it falls just shy of being timeless. Within a couple dozen years, it'll pass from relevancy to obscurity (except for those who enjoy the history of psychology and psychiatry). As of this moment in time, I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in psychology, probably most adolescent girls, and several adolescent boys (they are less likely to identify well with the protagonist). But as the years pass, those numbers will drop.<br /><br /> 4/5 stars.<br /><br />Memorable Quote:<br /><br /> Suicide is a form of murder--premeditated murder. It isn't something you do the first time you think of doing it. It takes getting used to. And you need the means, the opportunity, the motive. A successful suicide demands good organization and a cool head, both of which are incompatible with the suicidal state of mind.<br /><br />For more reviews like this, please check out my profile!

0439023513|3.0|Personally I loved the first two books and while this one is not bad it completely disappointed me...in the end I felt like there was no real resolution and of course I also felt depressed.     Even though I understand this book is primarily about war and the fact that afterwards with so many casualties and traumas sometimes is hard to separate the winners from the losers, this wasnt the only thing the book/trilogy was about, I feel like Mrs Collins decided to take a completely different turn with this book and honestly it was very disappointing that the Peeta many of us grew to love was pretty much taken away (for most of the book) when I have to admit his character was my favorite being that he provided a balance and a touch of \\"sweetness\\" to the story.      Also, being that Peeta is not really in the book I wish I would've been able to feel the relationship between Gale and Katniss more, yet even though they've been best friends for so long and apparently love one another they're relationship really doesn't translate into a passionate one for me.     I dont really want to write an essay for a review because Im actually too disappointed in this ending but the book ends like it begins for me, Katniss never really choses who she's in love with, and being that I love Peeta's character I find it extremely unfair to him. Katniss starts off lost, sad, being manipulated...goes through the book being in the hospital, drugged up, filming what feels like a reality show or documentary, again lost, sad, manipulated and ends up.....lost,sad and apparently still being manipulted since according to her she only has the children because of Peeta.    I get it war is bad but I ended up almost disliking Katniss' character being that she could apparently not make any real decisions and was void of emotions, also I did not really care about who died being that everyone was dying and Im still wondering who she would've chosen...had she actually chosen. I hope they make some changes ifthe do make the third movie.
B002KVSJ64|1.0|As a fan of Breaking Benjamin, and having eagerly awaited their next creation (I was highly impressed with their previous two alblums), I was expecting good things when I picked up \\"Dear Agony\\" last year - I even pre-ordered it well ahead of time; I believe I wasted my money.     In my own opinion, if you liked the pre-release single \\"I Will Not Bow\\" just download that and be happy. It is the only  Breaking Benjamin-esque song on the entire CD.      Having liked the mix of vocals and music employed on \\"Phobia\\" I thought this new record would be similar, maybe even better, only it wasn't. At all. No return to the semi-hardcore style the band is famous for, no entertaining blend of light and dark, nothing worthwhile whatsoever. If anything, it seemed like a thoroughly flat, tired, and pointless rendition of the softer parts of the \\"Phobia\\" alblum; aside from \\"I Will Not Bow\\" I cannot recall a single memorable song off the CD's list.      On the up side, if there is one, Ben Burnley's talent is still alive and well, and provides a reason to listen to the alblum once, maybe twice if you are really bored. Sadly, his ability is almost completely wasted on this underperforming record. If you are a true fan of BB, I guess it's worth a listen, but do yourself a favor and make sure you do it for free. I actually gave my CD away, something I rarely do, and don't miss it.      I mean no disrespect to those who enjoy this new release, though I don't see how you could. I still like the band, and will await their next release, while continuing to listen to their older, superior work. Hopefully, their next piece will be inspired, distinctive, and deserving of the band's talents. This one sure wasn't.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|The DVD arrived in a few days.  Fully intact.  Thank you for speedy delivery.  I gave the DVD set as a gift so I don't know about it's quality.  I'm assuming it was brand new because it looked like it and it was still wrapped.  Thank you!

B002T9H2ME|3.0|It's always interesting to me how I become aware of a film. Sometimes its from the obvious buzz throughout the mainstream media (television, print, online, etc.). Other times its from someone championing a small indie film that you might not otherwise hear of. Moon (2009) is one of the latter. I heard about this movie from a movie podcast or film critic I think. I honestly can't remember exactly where. But I'm glad regardless. Moon is one of those films that just surprises you. I've noticed that Sony Classics has been putting out a bunch of interesting indie films these past few years, even when everyone is seemingly saying that indie film is \\"dead\\" because of the major indie studios that have closed. I for one think Indie film is more than alive and will be even more so with all of the new less expensive technology allowing filmmakers to make their stories more cost effectively.<br /><br />What strikes me the most about Moon is the incredible acting by Sam Rockwell. He is the movie. Almost the entire film revolves around his character by himself, interacting with a computer named GERTY voiced by Kevin Spacey. The basic story of Moon is about Sam Bell, an Astronaut/Moon Miner living and working on the moon for a 3-year stint. He mines a mineral called helium-3 that he sends back to earth for use as a primary energy source. The rest of the story is best left for the movie to tell. I think the less you know about this film going in, the better. It's a character-driven mystery/thriller/drama that takes you on an interesting sci-fi journey that is atypical of the genre. It's a sci-fi film more along the lines of Gattaca (1997) and Never Let Me Go (2010). It's not really about all the cool technology and visual effects, but about the story and the characters.<br /><br />The cinematography by Gary Shaw is great, along with the production design by Tony Noble. I'm still amazed at what they created on the screen with only $5 Million supposedly for the production budget. You never question being on the Moon or in the space station, because every little detail was thought through. Clint Mansell put together a solid score that helps tell the story well. Clearly there was a good crew involved in the making of this film.<br />I really enjoyed Moon. It's not groundbreaking cinema, but a good solid filmmaking debut by new director Duncan Jones. I give it 3.5 stars out of 5. I've watched the trailer to Jones' new movie Source Code (2011) starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, and Vera Farmiga. It looks interesting, but very reminiscent of a string of Tony Scott films. I hope Jones' gives it something fresh like he's done with Moon. We'll see how it's received later this year.being on the Moon or in the space station, because every little detail was thought through.

B00006L6YH|5.0|I am 51 years old and had never heard of Diana Krall.     I was buying new speakers and was browsing through Amazons SA-CD section looking to purchase a few to enjoy once I got my new speakers integrated into my system. I wanted to buy an eclectic mix of titles to put my speakers to the test but also buy some of my old favorites. Being a child of the '70s but heavily influenced by the '60s, I have a large collection of rock from that era so I bought a couple of titles that I felt the SA-CD and surround sound technology would enhance, namely the Moody Blues' \\"To Our Childrens Childrens Children\\" & \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\". I also purchased the Doobie Brothers' \\"Toulouse Street\\" and Dire Straits' \\"Brothers in Arms\\". For a classical perspective I got \\"Baroque Music for Brass and Organ\\" by the Empire Brass Quintet with William Kuhlman on Organ. It seems I always read that you must get a good acoustic guitar recording to truly test your sound system so I bought \\"Artistry\\" by Martin Taylor and then to go to the other side of the spectrum, I got David Chesky's \\"Urban Concertos\\" (VERY different!).    So now all I need is some jazz and I try to play the guitar a little (emphasis on \\"try\\") so I was surfing through the jazz section and had picked out Grant Green's \\"Green Street\\" but had noticed 3 or 4 SA-CD's of some gal called Diana Krall. I read a few of the customer reviews and visited the Amazon Diana Krall page, listened to some of the samples and decided it sounded good enough to take a chance on. Boy am I glad I did!!! Man can this girl sing!!!! I got my Polk Audio Monitor 70's set up with my PSB Alpha B1's as surround w/PSB Alpha C1 center & Polk PSW-505 sub and this SA-CD is awesome!!!! In 5.1 surround her voice just drips out of the ceiling (at least at my house)! I turn the lights off, light a candle or two, get a nice single malt scotch and a good cigar then sit back and just melt into my leather chair! This is torch music at is VERY BEST! Imagine the '50s,a smoky bar, men wearing ties with their hats perched on the back of their heads, drinking scotch and smoking Lucky Strike non-filters.    I remember an album Carly Simon released around 1980 called \\"Torch\\" and I absolutely loved it. I actually had it in my shopping cart here at Amazon when I bought this along with the others I mentioned. I discarded it because I had spent enough already. Now I don't think I'll be needing it! No disrespect to Carly but I'll get more of Diana's SA-CD and enjoy this great music in style!
B002ZG981E|5.0|If your looking for a good movie with a plot that makes you actually think, then this movie is for you! A+++ film!
B003ZVJFFM|4.0|I liked it.  I own many many versions of the story, and each brings an interesting interpretation of the various characters, most notably, Scrooge.  I thought this particular version to be more appropriate to kids over 8 yrs of age.  It brought a tear to my eye, and Jim Carey did a great job - I would not have recognized his voice at all and his interpration of Scrooge's personality and character was well done.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|What an incredible book! There aren't words that do it justice. The twists, turns, surprises in it are absolutely amazing. I figured some things correctly, some things way off base - it kept me guessing and completely enthralled, intrigued throughout the entire series! Mac's journey is completed in this book, and it was an epic ride, for sure.  Karen Marie Moning is a true master!!!!!
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|There are some movies that sound like they would be impossible to make or at least make entertaining.  ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, APOLLO 13, DOUBT, THE QUEEN, SEABISCUIT, FROST/NIXON are just a few that spring to mind mainly because we know how they will end or that the plot seems one-note yet they turn out to be immensely enjoyable. THE SOCIAL NETWORK definitely falls into this catagory.  It sounds like it couldn't possibly be all that interesting yet not only is it but it is uncommonly entertaining!  Thanks to a terrific script,a fascinating musical score and a director who envisioned this story in a unique, almost mystical way THE SOCIAL NETWORK is quite a ride in an intellectual, nerd-filled amusement park.  The film quality is first-rate and the acting is outstanding.  If these roles were not handled by these particular actors, I'm not sure the film would have been as good as it is. I found myself thinking and talking about this film days after I'd seen it so while I know everyone's taste is, well, their own, and while I hesitate to recommend movies (the last time I recommended a movie so highly was SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE and my friends and family threatened to disown me), I just can't help myself with this one.  I found it to be the best movie of the year.
B00364K6YW|5.0|After reading the reviews of the 1st released Special Edition DVD set vs. the VHS set, I wanted to wait until they could do a better job of restoring the color in regards to color and scenery.  I'm glad I waited.  Amazon has this at a good price and it is wonderful.  I read the reviews about how vivid the Blu-ray edition was.  Well, I do not have a Blu-ray player and I'm sure I'm not the only one, so this DVD (restored edition) should be just as satisfying to 99% of the fans of this mini-series.  With that said, I want to add that this adaptation is far the best!!!
0812973992|2.0|I liked the book. Then after reading 349 pages of good writing, I made the mistake of reading the authors notes. These 4 pages knocked me off my tightrope and ruined the book for me. It would have been better for he author to keep his blatant political leanings from an otherwise decent read.
B0041T7FS6|5.0|Been a big CHIC fan for decades, both for their own work as Chic and their Chic written & produced albums/tracks - now this is a box set done right! All the keys tracks included, many full-length mixes, respectful remixes by Dimitri from Paris, and, most importantly, key cuts from unreleased Chic-helmed early 80s LPs by Johnny Mathis and Fonzi Thorton - the Mathis and Thorton tracks are revelations - it's really tragic that Columbia decided to shelve the 1981 Chic-produced Mathis album fearing it was potentially \\"too out there\\" and might \\"alienate\\" Johnny's MOR/AC audience.  To hear Mathis' signature vocals over some of the funkiest grooves Nile & Nard ever produced is amazing, if not a bit bittersweet to know that Sony will most likely never release the whole album officially - still, it's a nice, eye-opening bonus to get three cuts here remastered for posterity.  Even stronger is the lone unreleased track from the Fonzi Thorton's sadly shelved \\"Frostbite\\" album - the should-have-been-hit \\"I'll Change My Game\\" is one of Fonzi's strongest vocals set over a driving Chic uptempo groove - along with \\"I Work for A Livin,\\" makes you wonder what Atlantic was thinking shelving Fonzi's CD?  Well, at least we have \\"The Leader\\" on CD.  Chic-driven tracks by Debbie Harry, Norma Jean, Diana Ross, et al. all prove how, no matter what the performer/artist, the essence was truly, timelessly...CHIC!

0765326353|5.0|I had never read any of Brandon Sanderson's books, but I liked what he had written for the Wheel of Time series after taking the series over for the late Robert Jordan, so I decided to give this book a try.<br /><br />This book was absolutely fantastic & I cannot wait for the next one to come out, but I know that will be a while since he still has to finish the last Wheel of Time book, but I will be waiting. Brandon Sanderson is a great write with a great imagination & his action sequences are as exciting and as detailed as R.A. Salvatore's.<br /><br />I read a review before I bought this book & the person had said that there are too many characters in the book to learn and keep up with. I don't think that person was very bright. I had absolutely no problem keeping up with the characters. Sanderson makes each main character VERY memorable. Actually, these characters are a lot easier to keep up with than the characters from the Wheel of Time.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to all lovers of fantasy.
0613237528|2.0|This book was on a recommended reading list from a seventh grade English teacher.  Though well written, I think it is inappropriate for the average young teen.  The main character's  diary, started after the suicide of his best friend, relates experimenting with drugs and  alcohol and observing acquaintances having intercourse.  The main character has  sensitive issues in his life.  Thankfully psychiatric treatment and close friends help him  find peace and maturity.  Careful guidance is needed for a young person reading this book.
B00092ZMDY|2.0|I was fortunate enough to see the Eagles reunion tour back in '95.  THAT show was phenomenal. They rocked the house better than any band I'd ever seen up too and beyond that point. The song selection was fantastic, Don Felder was still with the band, they didn't \\"dumb down\\" their material by injection a horn section and overplaying the weak solo material. When Joe Walsh played \\"Funk 49\\", \\"In the City\\" and \\"Walk Away\\", it was ROCKIN'!<br /><br />This show is completely different and not in a good way.<br />The lack of Don Felder in the band really, really shows. The tunes that used to really rock, are now \\"pop synthesized\\" so often, that it no longer has the weight that the old songs used to have. It's like they decided to intentionally make it easy listening instead of crankin' it up and just jammin' like they used to. It's so obviously the Glenn Frey/Don Henley show, with Schmidt and Walsh as supporting cast, that it takes away the \\"band\\" feel of the show.<br />This show was way too contrived, with an obvious agenda towards appealing to the pompous and the yuppies who weren't cool in the 70's and 80's, but who can now afford a ticket to one of the most expensive concerts on the planet. Corporate sell out at it's finest.<br /><br />And by the way..... the guitarist who \\"replaced\\" Don Felder, and I use that word lightly, does not hold a candle to Don Felder as a guitarist. Nor was there any chemistry between him and Joe Walsh what so ever. It was really very sad. Not his fault, as those shoes would be nearly impossible for anyone to fill. But none the less, this show missed Don Felder in the worst way. The HFO show clearly shows how the music should be played and by whom it should be played.<br /><br />Henley and Frey have clearly lost their way.....
B000MF4O82|4.0|Well, there's a pretty simple litmus test as to whether you'll enjoy this film or not: if you enjoyed [[ASIN:B00005N7Z1 Robocop]], director Paul Verhoeven and screenwriter Edward Neumeier's previous collaboration, you'll probably get a kick out of this one, too. All the same elements that distinguish that work mark STARSHIP TROOPERS: blackly comic satire disguised as mindless sci-fi action, omnipresent ultra-violence, send-ups of American TV ads, etc. Not to everyone's taste, I'm sure, but those who appreciate Verhoeven's distinctive sensiblity should have a blast. Also recommended to fans of comics creator Frank Miller's ([[ASIN:1563893428 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]], [[ASIN:1569710678 Give Me Liberty (Martha Washington Series)]], etc.) work, and vice versa.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|My title says it all.  This is truly a must have for all Beatles  / John Lennon fans.  I consider it as good as if not better than the 1980 original.  John and Yoko are singing without most of the instruments so his voice is right out front.  Yoko does not sound too bad on most of the tracks too.  Buy this immediately. There is no question, you must own this if you consider yourself a fan.  I promise you will not regret this purchase.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|So if you did a search for this processor you should see the 980x below for 999.99.  Well with a little overclocking this chip can do what the 980x does!  I just built my new setup ( my first build ever) i love this chip!  I bought the 2500k i5 first but took it back and boy i am glad i did.  If you are considering this chip, stop now and buy it! ::: HOWEVER NOT FROM AMAZON :::  I got it at my local Micro Center for 279.99.
B004APVI1G|5.0|I loved this movie and would wholeheartedly recommend it if you are 3d enabled. I know 30 bucks is alot to spend on a movie but this is worth it. I'm waiting for Avatar to come out in 3d because I doubt if that movie will look better than this. I've also viewed 'A Christmas Carol' in 3d and 'Legend of the Guardians' beats it hands down. You won't go wrong with this purchase because this is the kind of movie you can view repeatedly and be blown away as opposed to most movies that get watched once or twice and then forgotten. This is definitely a keeper !
B004DK49DW|5.0|I like this album, love the backing vocals on California and Can't take it with you. A mixture of Between heaven and hell and sex, love and rock and roll but with more of the Stones influence showing.
B003X2O6MK|5.0|I have every album that Kanye West has produced; he is a hard working man who really cares about his music.  He is not an artist who produces songs over night, but pours his heart and soul into his work.  Any artist who does that has my vote.  I love the cd and if you are a true Kanye West fan like my-self, I recommend that you get this album.     Not to mention that Kanye West My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy has went platinum!  Congratulations Mr. West
1400052173|5.0|I could hardly put this book down! It goes back and forth between the story of the life of Henrietta and her family and the story of the reseach and science of the cells. The autor did this in a very skillful way and I never felt the thread of the story was unraveling. She made the people come alive for me. The book certainly does give one casuse to think about some of the issues around tissue research that we might not otherwise think about. The list of resources and citations is incredible-this woman has probably done more research during the years she spent working on this book than most people do in their whole life.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I was so excited to read this book.  It was amazing.  I won't put any spoilers here, KMM did not disappoint.  I'm so happy the series is going to go a little further into the fever world.  Christian maybe?  Ryodan, Lor or even Dani's stories??  I'm so happy Adam made an appearance.  Great book.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was a great read.. its the kind of story that once you finish it you find your self thinking about it and the characters, whose pain and emotions you felt so vividly.  i loved this book and i recomend it to anyone who loves a story that takes you deep into the characters mind.
B0026P40NU|5.0|I was interested in seeing this because I am a fan of one of the main actors. However, this great BBC series made me a fan of an artform so much so that I am reading the book this show was based off of, searching out museums in hopes I can see pieces in person and wanting to learn more about the movement & the other artists. I really enjoyed the entire cast; the stories behind these artists definitely keep the show rolling and still barely touch the surface of the PRB circle...    It's a wonderful show and still only a peak into those that made up the PRB.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|Initially, I considered this album was a disappointing follow-up to \\"Only by the Night.\\"  It just seems like the band thought they were getting to mainstream with the last album (the album did TOO well?) and \\"Come Around Sundown\\" is a counter reaction to that.  The songs have a completely different vibe than on \\"Only...\\", with a more laid-back, raw feel and evident of Kings of Leon's signature style.  I would definitely recommend this album, just don't expect a sequel to the last one!
B00005T7I1|5.0|It's been about 20 years since i've seen this movie and I must say, I had as much fun watching it as an adult as I had watching it as a kid; TIMELESS!!!  FANTASTIC JOB, WARREN, AL, MADONNA, DUSTIN AND THE REST OF THE CAST AND CREW!!!  I only wish they would have made a sequel, or at least, release a special edition!
0553212737|1.0|Four hundred pages of the idle rich filling up their vain and empty lives by meddling in other people's affairs while exchanging gossip and pointless drivel about their relative social standing, followed by one hundred pages of an embarrassingly bad romance novel, plus one very annoying character (Emma's father) who clearly has undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome.  I wanted to slap everyone in the book.  The only happy ending for this book would have been for all the characters to lose all their money and have to get jobs and actually do something for a living.  Yes, I understand the points that Austen was trying to make about social mores etc., but those points were clearly made within the first 20 pages; the remaining 480 were superfluous.  I wanted to rate this book higher by saying that \\"although the characters and plot are insipid, annoying, and boring, the writing was wonderful,\\" but I can't, because Austen's writing is almost as annoying as her plot.
0446195529|4.0|This book starts off with a bang and the pace is maintained throughout pretty well. The story is tight and the characterizations are pretty good for such a plot-driven effort. I've read some reviews that intimated that the Camel Club played only a cameo role. They may not be front and center throughout the book, but I think the brevity of their role has been overstated by some. My major disclaimer on this book is that there are so many red herrings they no longer come as a surprise but are expected. When they are expected, they lose their effectiveness. Also, when threads are being followed, it came to the point where I began to wonder why when it was a false lead anyway. That said, I still found it to be very enjoyable and look forward to what comes next.
B00000612P|5.0|I bought this CD for a friend as a present. Personally I adore the album. It is the soundtrack of my youth and I do not sing along to it alone, I am with all the ghosts and memories of those times. It is merely perfectly wonderful. Check out the wanna bes singing Mandolin Wind on youtube, then listen to the real thing and you get the point. When Rod sings it, grown men weep. Maggie May is one song that needs no introduction or comment. Every picture tells a story is a fable of a young lad seeing the world and finding love.   Anyhow, the friend who had never head it adored it too, so the torch is passed on
B00000AF98|3.0|Some KISS fans are way too harsh on this album as there are some incredibly strong songs and standout tracks.  I don't find the production to be all that bad either like some on here have claimed.  But for me, Crazy Nights could have been a solid Ten like Lick It Up was.  Stand out tracks are the title track Crazy Nights, Turn On The Night, Reason To Live, No No No, Good Girl Gone Bad, My Way and Hell Or High Water.  The album should have had more input from Bruce and Eric and Paul should not have been allowed to put on pure drivel like Bang Bang You, When Your Walls Come Down and Fight Hell To Hold You.  Those three tracks really kill the album.  But how some fans can diss the title track I will never understand.  It's a monster of a song with one hell of a hook!!!!!
B0000C5RQF|3.0|I had previewed the Queen of the Night aria for this production on y o u t u b e DOT c o m, and was really looking forward to this, but it fell a little short.  It's OK, but ...     For one thing, I am shocked by the sexism in this opera (I hadn't seen this opera before). I am surprised more people are not offended by it.    The recording itself has problems.  The video is very dark, and some voices are quite faint, or fade in and out.  For example, I think I would have liked the three boys more if I could have heard them properly.  The dark video and minimal props with the faint voices give the impression the actors are performing in a big empty warehouse.  (Maybe that is what an opera house is?)    Regarding the performances, Papageno and Queen of the Night were fabulous.  Papageno has a great voice and great comic acting, and interacts well with the other players.  Not only does Queen of the Night hit all the difficult high notes, she does it while dashing around the stage!  Her costume is brilliant!  All to good effect!  If I were picking singles from this DVD, Queen of the Night's first aria would be the A-side.     Pamina is beautifully sung, and well acted.  Monostades is a funny character; he's probably meant to be menacing, but he's played comically here.      The other characters are not memorable.  No, wait -- Papagena is memorable for wearing 20th century clothes while the other characters are wearing 18th century clothes -- why?       There are a few scenes with too many dancers and characters wandering about the stage.  The dancing was not particularly good, but maybe that's because the camera was panning in for close ups of the dancers instead of giving us broad shots of the action.     The DVD does has a synopsis and subtitles which are vital to following the plot, such as it is.      The DVD has some very nice moments, but overall, something of a disappointment.
B000S5AISQ|4.0|This is a great album.  The banter is fun (Buy me a soda?).  After listening to the Pixies and the Breeders I can't figure out why Kim Deal wasn't allowed to write more songs especially since the 2 bands sound so similar.  Having a few more Deal songs would have made Trompe le Monde a better album for sure.
030746363X|5.0|I've being reading this book for the past 3weeks; I love it, it's an entertaining and informative read with loads of tips and guides to improve not just your physical quadrant but your mental, emotional, etc... Tim Ferriss playfully and intelligently covers aspects to health and fitness that would normally be too much of a \\"grey area\\" or risqué for most fitness or medical professionals to touch.  Whats really cleaver about the book is that you can treat it as a trivia or fact finder, in the sense that if you goal is body building, fat-loss, injury prevention, etc, Tim can show you what he believes is the quickest route to achieve this or, if ya want, you can just read it for fun!  More than a book, the quick and lucid websites on the book just add to the sense of incredible dept to the down-to-earth author's enthusiasm!    This book is a must have for any fitness professional (such as myself) or fitness enthusiast!
B003HARV3Y|5.0|This was an excellent movie, however, if you are looking for purity of translation from book to movie you may be disappointed. There were several points where the movie translation of the book strayed. Unfortunately, they were also key points and minor points. It will be interesting to see how they recover from leaving out or flat out changing the key points in future movies. I still recommend the movie, just don't look for a literal translation.

B000002J0B|5.0|Another reviewer said the re-mastered version was too trebbly and to buy the original.  The re-master is a little treble-heavy, but I wouldn't seek out the original.  I listened to the two on headphones and thought that the remaster has:<br /> - Removed audible hiss<br /> - Removed some vocal distortion<br /> - Added clarity to the thicker parts of the mix<br /> - Balanced/boosted the volume some (esp. The Crunge)<br /> - Made the acoustic guitar intro to Over the Hills and Far Away a tiny bit \\"thinner\\"<br /> - Made Plant's voice a little more trebbly in a way that's sometimes mildly annoying (the end of The Crunge or Dancing Days).<br /><br />The differences between the two CD releases are very subtle.  A little bit of wow and flutter may have been ironed out as well, but it's subtle enough that I could be imagining it.  If asked to tell which one I was listening to without being able to hear them side-by-side, I probably couldn't tell unless the track had audible hiss.  I really can't say one is better, just different.<br /><br />A great album, definitely buy either version.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Seems like every few years, a band comes to America with American music that most pop tarts toss aside as rubbish, but then the Brits take it and give it new life and appreciation.  Last time was the Stones back in the 60's with Blues.  Today we have Mumford & Sons with Folk/Bluegrass.  Before the Stones fanboys light me on fire, let me say this, Mumford & Sons may not be as good as Mick and the guys, but I don't think I'll be the only one drawing this parallel.  Thanks guys for bringing me rocking into the 21st century and taking me back to my roots.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|I don't get all the great reviews for a bond movie that lack identity. To me this movie was dull and a drivel. And to hard core. James Bond is suppose to be fun, sexy and exciting. And for me Daniel Craig was only cute. That's it. I didn't finish the movie I skipped through it to get to the end. Why haven't there been anymore James Bond movies if this one was so good. Because it wasn't. This movie was not fun to watch and Daniel Craig is no James Bond. Priece Brosan got him beat by a million miles. If you want to see a great James Bond movie I recommend Never Say Never, Octpussy, Die Another Day (I love this one), and Diamonds are Forever. Not this thud.
0316044695|4.0|Very moving story of unbelievable training regimen and subsequent worst disaster in US Special Forces Military history.  Literally brings tears to the eyes of a grown man as I read toward the end of the story. We should all be proud to have  the best men our country has to offer defending us against brutal savages the world over.
B003GDYN24|5.0|Flesh Tone is approahing a techno medal sound with open eyes.  The teasing voice of Kelis forces you to embrace love and independence away from the mindset of worldly thinking in terms of hot fleshly desire and escorts you into the dance only party mode. When all you want is the pounding sound of voice and beat, nine compositions are more than enough to take your breath away and satisfy your eardrum.  Rest assured, when you are ready to open up for the party, you will be able to get your grove on.

B004DK49DW|3.0|Mike Ness is one of the greats in the punk-rock scene, but this release is a real letdown after their last album \\"Sex, Love And Rock 'N' Roll\\".  It just doesn't flow well for me.  They have some good tunes in \\"Road Zombie\\",  \\"California (Hustle And Flow)\\", \\"Can't Take It With You\\" both songs have female backing vocals (kind of like Blue Oyster Cult had on their \\"Mirrors\\" album), and \\"Machine Gun Blues\\".  Overall just not enough blistering sounds I come to enjoy by this band.  Don't wait so long between releases.

141690977X|5.0|If you watched Sex and the City, or have seen the He's Just Not That Into You movie, you probably already know what the book is about. But if you've missed out on the screen versions, He's Just Not That Into You demystifies the bizarre behaviour of men in dating scenarios. Greg Behrendt shares insights that women have been sorely missing for decades. Centuries probably. He basically takes all the hours we've spent obsessing about what the confusing behaviour of the opposite sex means and boils it down to one simple truth. A guy who likes you will not leave you wondering and sitting by the phone. Period.    As I read this book I saw EXACT examples of male behaviour that I have been subject to. I know Greg and Liz haven't met my exes, but I swear they were recounting stories I have lived. I've already re-read multiple sections, because their advice is just that great. Their message may be a bit hard to take at first, because nobody really wants to accept that the guy who didn't call just doesn't like them, but I think this book is genius. And while it may seem disheartening at first, its really a book that focuses on how awesome women are and why we should love ourselves enough to not let a guy treat us any less than great.    All women who are dating should keep He's Just Not That Into You handy as a reference. Read it, and then when you're lying awake wondering what his latest behaviour means, check it and I bet you'll find your answer.

B0049OSQ18|4.0|After the longform ramble that was The Hazards of Love, The King is Dead is a very welcome return to form for a band at its best when writing short stories in lieu of novels. The Decemberists of old are back, and they've clearly exorcised some of the demons that gave birth to the bloated and hookless Hazards and returned to the pop base of their roots.<br /><br />This record is being touted as something of a country diversion for the band, but this description doesn't wash with me, and I'll tell you why. The Decemberists have always owed a large musical debt to folk and country music, employing dobro and peddle steel and organ and other instruments well-played in both genres. Opener \\"Don't Carry It All\\" showcases a very Neil Young-esque harmonica, and I think that it is this early country twang that is coloring the opinions of many a reviewer.  This is a folk pop album in much of the same vein as the first three (and aruagably best) Decemberists records, with all the hooks and songcraft befitting the genre.<br /><br />Musically, the band is in top form. As I have mentioned, the vocal hooks in this album are incredibly catchy and beg to be sung, which is something I can't say about Hazards and to a lesser extent, the very good Crane Wife. \\"Don't Carry It All\\" and \\"Rox in the Box\\" have a folk-rock stomp reminiscent of some of the tougher tracks on Crane Wife, while a number of songs, such as \\"Rise to Me\\" and \\"January Hymn\\" showcase the band's gentler, balladeering side that was seldom seen on Hazards.<br /><br />Production-wise, this definitely sounds like a Decemberists record. At first listen, the vocals seemed jarringly loud, but when I went back into their catalogue, I realized that front-and-center vox have always been a hallmark of their music, so it bothered me less upon that acknowledgment. I think I've been listening to a little much shoegaze and noise pop lately such that I'm unused to music where the vocals are truly the star of the show. Colin's singing is very nice throughout, and as I mentioned before, he has rediscovered the singable hooks that defined the early releases by the band.<br /><br />Never one to shy away from their influences, I can hear a lot of Neil Young in this record, but perhaps more tellingly, I hear a lot of the pop hooks of Simon & Garfunkel in the album's more tender moments. This is absolutely a record for fans and general music listeners too, and will likely prove to be an early highlight for the year.nd as I mentioned before, he has rediscovered the singable hooks that defined the early releases by the band.

B000BT97AO|5.0|Awesome, awesome movie! Creative and different than what you're used to seeing in a movie. And though it's all said through the name of the movie, it's still a thinker. It expands your mind and lets your creativity flow. Visually, this movie is excellent. The story line is well played out too. Gotta see it! I recommended it to everyone.
B003XUKVXK|5.0|Great live performance. Kenny back to his rockin blues style, every song is worth listening to.  Mostly known songs from studio discs, good arrangements, good sound quality and that \\"live vibe\\" that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up!
B000002KIE|3.0|I tried to like this, but it's unlistenable.  J. Rotten is the most untalented singer ever, and not even in a good way like the guy in Social Distortion.  S. Vicious was a mental patient. I could forgive them that.  What I hate them for is they helped set the stage for songs that should have been banned forever, like \\"Belsen was a Gas\\" (Bergen-Belsen was the Nazi concentration camp best known to the British like Auschwitz  is to Americans.  It was a \\"Gas\\", get it?) That was the culture.  At the time movies like Deep Throat and Texas Chainsaw Massacre were going mainstream.  Alice Cooper sang about Dead Babies.  Yikes!   Seemed so daring at the time.   They and their contemporaries set a bad precedent.  The Rolling Stones  got \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\" banned from the Ed Sullivan Show (they had to sing \\"Let's Spend some Time Together\\").  Elvis got banned for wiggling his hips suggestively (he was only filmed on TV from the waist up).  All this banning cemented their reputations.  Today, every other artist out their has that tiny black Parential Advisory sticker in lower right hand corner warning any Parents that are actually monitoring the stuff of  boring repetitions of the F word, all the demeaning words and attitudes for women you can jam into one song, and, if you're feeling ambitious, celebrations of rape and shooting people.  Oh yeah.   Oh, what was the revolution started by the Sex Pistols anyway?  Freeing us from the tyranny of listening to the Eagles' \\"Hotel California\\" one more time?  I guess they did that, god bless 'em.   Having said that, I always had a soft spot for Nirvana, because they made tight, incredible music, and K. Cobain saw through the hype of the music industry of how important it was all supposed to be.  He guessed (rightly) that it didn't mean squat.  He sang (rightly) that the kids didn't have a clue.  Gasp!  You are supposed to tell the kids they Rock! That's part of the game.  His music was impressive, but it was also a product on the shelf down the isle from the Teen Spirit deodorant.  Every kid smells great, and kid every thinks his ugly rap or goth or death metal song is stickin' it to somebody.  Every kid thinks his Saturday evening spent at the latest Saw torture porn fest is daring. Please.  Not anymore.

B002VPE1WK|3.0|I looked all around to find a light weight backpack for my Nikon camera systems, and this one made for Amazon is the one with the perfect size for me. I can easily pack my whole system with some room for extra room for more small items. What in the backpack now are:    1) D7000 body plus battery charger; 2) Nikon 80-200/f2.8AFS; 3) Nikon 17-35/f2.8AFS; 4) Nikon 28-70/f2.8AFS; 5) Nikon 60/f2.8D micro; 6) Nikon SB-28 flash; 7) Sekonik L-508 light meter; 8) Cokin P-size filter ring, mount and shade; 9) Gradual neutral density filters for Cokin P; 10) Nikon circular polarizer (77 mm); 11) Remote control, lens paper, flash accessories, etc.    I cannot fit the original metal lens shades in the bag so I bought a rubber one. However, if you do not need to pack all these lenses, you can fit the original shades with two lenses. You can mount any above lenses on the camera and fit in the backpack ready to shoot.    I am extremely happy with the size, perfect for me. However, the construct of the backpack is not so good. The side and bottom paddings are too thin, no good for the heavy weigh of the pro lenses. There is no problem that the bag will hold them. But you have to be really careful that no impact happens to the bag with camera equipment. When you put you camera bag down, you have to be very careful and slow otherwise you will feel and hear the impact of your lens hitting the hard floor.    When I received mine, there was an hold in one of the center dividers.    I am disappointed at the quality and construct of the backpack. A little more improvement could make it the best value for the price. Beside the padding, I wish the depth of the backpack could be 0.5 to 1 in more.    The backpack is OK for casual photographers but not good for pro quality lenses.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I've had a chance to read many of the reviews posted here about season 6.  While I agree that season 6 did cause me to have quite a number of WHAT THE HECK? moments....I'm not sure why so many people feel \\"cheated\\" or \\"slighted\\" or \\"let down\\" by the way it ended.      I can appreciate the different levels of intelligence, philosophy, spiritual / religous belief, and over all view of life.  We all are going to have differing opinions on the way the show ended.    For me, a man who probably had the worst stretch of years in his life, from the end of 2005-the start of 2009.....LOST was life altering and helped me realize a lot of things about myself.  I am soooooo greatful for the WGA strike in late 2007 that drove me to drive down to blockbuster in search of something to watch, because I was so sick and tired of re-runs!!!  I settled on the first two discs of season 1 of LOST....and I was hooked!!!!!    This show taught me a lot about life, friends, relationships, and moving on.  I know it sounds strange and ridiculous to say this because in the end....this was just a TV show.....but it somehow gave me hope....gave me moments to pause and think about how the things in my life that were happening...could have been for a \\"reason.\\"  It made me realize, no matter how much life beats you up and how bad things may seem....you have to keep moving forward....because tomorrow is a new day.      In the end...I agree that the show was about the characters...their lives...how they all needed each other...how nobody does it alone....about faith...not necessarily in God or any specific religion...but just faith that allows you to accept certain things that you cannot change. They were all broken or damaged in some way when they got to the island....like I was when I started watching this show.  In the end.....they all seemed to have found the inner peace they all seemed to want and need......    I am almost there myself....but I know I would not have gotten even this far...had it not been for this great TV show.      Regardless of all the craziness and confusion surrounding season 6......the ending was the ending....and while I miss my favorite show of all time dearly.....I am cool with it...and accepted it.      We gotta learn to live together...or we're gonna die alone.....
0307454541|4.0|Far too detailed with minutiae of no real value to the telling of what has to be (when devoid of the minor details) one of the most intriguing tales I have read in seveal years. What sets this book apart from others in this genre is the fact that it is only one-third of the complete story. If read by itself, you may find yourself wondering why so many peoplehave rated it so highly. But if you read it and then go on to the other two (The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest), you come to see that this is truly a great tale (one tale, not three) about a genuinely heroic woman who refuses to take the world on any terms but her own. Well worth reading if you read all three, as I did, even if it is a bit over-written.
B003UBTX72|1.0|His writing style appears to be lacking the same focus and direction (and wit) he had while in the deepest throws of Heroin addiction.  I really tried to read this, but it was just too crappy to finish it.
142311339X|5.0|Mythological Fantasies are my favorite type of read and this story does not disappoint.  Give yourself plenty of time to sit down and read because once you get engrossed in the story you won't want to out it down.  Riordan once again displays his knowledge of ancient mythology by introducing us to the Roman side of the Greek gods.<br /><br />As the earth awakens we see the rise of a new sting of monsters.  After so many books one would worry that Riordan's stories may begin to stale but that is not the case at all.  His stories do not have the typical predictable plots as so many authors follow.<br /><br />As a teacher I also appreciate the fact that these books do not fall into the use of cursing or raunchy story lines that so many YA stories seem to have.  I am not concerned about having this in my classroom library for teenagers.
0385341679|4.0|I loved this series and was lucky to only stumble on it in August 2010.  I devoured the first few books and considered the wait for the final excruciating.  I purchased it pre-order for Kindle as soon as it was available.  And I waited.    The writing is superb, the tension high and hope sneaks its pretty head in throughout - without taking away from the heavy themes.  Not all of my questions were answered satisfactorily, but most of them were.  That's a huge coup in my eyes.  But still - who IS Barrons?  Am I satisfied with Mac's ultimate role?  I'll have to mull it over.    When the new series comes out, I will probably wait to purchase it for a few years.  Such great story lines lose some of their impact when they are spread out too far.    Over all - AMAZING series and a really, really good book.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Several friends have recommended this series and I would really like to read it but not at this price.  I am supposed to pay $8.99 for an e-book that is over 10 years old?  No thanks.  Even though I own a Kindle I will go to the used book store and pay a much lower price.  The publishers need to get a grip on reality.
B00499K9E0|4.0|This series is excellent!<br /><br />Holmes is a bit of a know-it-all, but Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Holmes is nuanced, raising the character from mere smart ass to human.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to more episodes from this series, and I don't admit that publicly very often.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This was my first BD since i got my PS3 and what a BD it was. I have seen the movie a zillion times, but the BD just looked like a whole new movie. Highly recommended.
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|Excellent review by JFW. I'm not going to attempt to review each performance, but rather give an overview of the collection. I also have many of the previous incarnations of the Bernstein recordings including various Royal Editions and Bernstein Century editions. These are definitely not remasterings, but rather the most recent masterings available. I have the previous Mahler remasterings from 2001 and those included here are definite improvements in sound quality, suggesting the most recent (2009) mastering were included. Obviously if you have a number of these recordings, you may not find this collection worth the money. However, I believe this collection offers outstanding value especially to those who are interested in Bernstein's NYPO recording legacy. I also think this would be a great addition to newcomers to classical music that are looking for more \\"serious\\" or complete symphony recordings beyond the standard overtures and shorter works. While everyone will have their own favorites and no conductor is great in all symphonies, listeners will find complete recordings in acceptable to great performances of the Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, Schumann, Sibelius and Tchaikovsky symphonies. The sound quality is not always up to par with modern technology (Franck Symphony in D), but it is always acceptable. I also own the later, DG Mahler symphony cycle and while it is also great, I prefer the earlier cycle simply for the sense of discovery and youthful vigor that Bernstein brings to these works. Other standouts are the Haydn symphonies and Prokofiev's 5th. The 5th in particular is simply an outstanding performance.     I'm a little disappointed that Sony seems to have arbitrarily gone for a \\"symphony\\" collection as great recordings of non-symphony named works such Copland's Appalachian Spring and Rodeo and choral works such as Berlioz's Requiem are absent. Also missing are Bernstein's recordings of popular lollipops like Tchaikovsky's Capriccio Italian and Rimsky Korsakov's Capriccio Espagnol. Popular concertos are missing as well. As others have pointed out, the box set is an unusual size. Although this didn't bother me as much as I rip all of my music and store it on my computer for wireless playback.     In summary, this is a great collection for those interested in Bernstein's recorded legacy and/or looking for an introduction to major classical works. Considering the collection of Bernstein's Mahler Symphonies (minus Das Lied von der Erde) alone goes for about $60, this is great value for the number of works included.
030746363X|5.0|I thought that you cannot write two great books in a row. But, I was mistaken. Tim could write to of my faves in a row.<br /><br />This one is as good as [[ASIN:0307465357 The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated: Expanded and Updated, With Over 100 New Pages of Cutting-Edge Content.]].<br /><br />If there's any chance that you want to improve your body -and I'm sure you are-, then, this is your book.
193659451X|1.0|This is the third book by Austen I forced my way through, but I must admit, I find her writing dry, humorless, dull, and always the same themes. It's the constant talk about class, and who is good enough for whom, and the woman and man who just can't seem to get together until the very end when they admit their mutual love. It's all very tedious. I don't find a clever word or thought in her books. I only got through 1/2 this book, and then, in boredom, threw it aside for SINISTER STREET by Compton Mackenzie. Besides, there were many characters introduced throughout the novel, and I couldn't keep them in mind. They were not at all developed as characters. They were relatives and friends, and I didn't care about any of them for they were not portrayed in enough detail to distinguish them apart.<br />I guess, I will give up on Austen. My favorites are Trollope and Hardy. Sinister Street, so far, is superb. One really understands Michael Fane and his little sister!
0316098337|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Telling this story from 5 yr old Jacks point of view gave it a really unique twist. I didn't find the grammar and speech of being otld from a point of view of a 5yr old and issue at all but worth sticking it out even if you find this troublesome.

B0034G4P7Q|4.0|Facebook has become one of the most used social networking sites. And while Facebook has grown by leaps and bounds, its creator (Mark Zuckerberg) seems both illusive and mysterious, maybe even aloof, yet brilliant. \\"Social Network\\" was intended to offer us a look (fact or fiction) into the psyche of Zuckerberg as he builds something that will influence society in ways that we never imagined. We view Zuckerberg's rise...from his creation of an idea that resulted from an uncomfortable situation with a girlfriend...to those speed bumps that marred his rise to notoriety. While his intentions initially seem \\"mean spirited\\", you see what power someone can have when they are able to communicate with large numbers of people with mere keystrokes. While he intended to embarrass a girlfriend, he literally created an idea that would revolutionize communication with the creation of the Facebook. While it seemed that his genius often caused him to be insensitive to his friend's feelings and at times seem heartless, you soon come to understand the sheer genius of someone who is so caught up into creating something unimaginable that they become \\"disconnected\\", not necessarily arrogant or ambitious (as you would expect).     The movie also delved into the two lawsuits that surround the evolution of Facebook. There was Zuckerberg's best-friend who not only bankrolled the operation, and created the language that allowed the system to interface (or something like that), but who was pushed aside when Napster creator/party animal Sean Parker burst on the scene (who suggested changing the name from \\"the Facebook\\" to just \\"Facebook\\"), with ideas that would literally move Zuckerberg's College networking system to the International arena. The other lawsuit revolved around Harvard/Olympic bound twins who felt that Zuckerberg stole their idea after they approached him about creating a dating site. As the two suits are eventually resolved, you aren't really sure if anyone is really a winner, especially from the perspective of Zuckerberg whose reputation, energy and time has gone into fighting both. To me, the movie really wasn't about the money or the fame, but about how ironic it is that someone who is responsible for single-mindedly changing communication through social networking could seem so alone. His seeming ineptness, social awkwardness, or perhaps lack of concern for others makes you truly sympathize for him. But then again, aren't most geniuses socially ackward?    I am not sure if this is fact or fiction, and it really isn't important. Social Network was a thought provoking movie that I recommend without reservation. I think that Jessie Eisenberg was brilliant (mannerisms and diction) as Mark Zuckerberg. Andrew Garfield was compelling as the dedicated yet betrayed best-friend. And Justin Timberlake is exceptional as Sean Parker, the charismatic Napster developer. Again I recommend this movie to those who want to see how an idea can revolutionize the world and change society as no other.
0385341679|5.0|Shadowfever is like the 6 hour long DVD release of a movie that was only 2 in the theaters.  It doesn't have the \\"tight\\" feeling or momentum that the earlier books in the series did.  On the other hand, for good reason.  Karen Marie Moning (KMM) set out to answer ALL our questions here.  From an author who devised four utterly sadistic cliff-hanger endings for every other book in the series, sitting down with SHADOWFEVER and having the author basically say, \\"Sit back and I will give you everything you want\\" is beyond delicious.  It's like a gift, like a little hug to her readers.<br /><br />But I'm not a reasonable observer.  To be perfectly honest, if KMM released short stories about Jericho Barrons doing his taxes...I'd read them and like it.<br /><br />I read SHADOWFEVER all the way through once, and I felt...partly elated, because it's great, but partly a little irritable.  KMM is trying to do SO MUCH with this book.  Just think about it.  She's wrapping up this whole series, and that means telling us: Who was the Beast in DREAMFEVER?  Who is the Unseelie King?  Who is the Concubine?  Why are they still relevant?  Does Mac find her sister's killer?  Who is it, and does she achieve the vengeance she craved?  What happens with the Sinsar Dubh?  What about Rowena?  What about V'Lane, and Barrons, and the Dreamy Eyed Boy, and Christian MacKeltar?  Or the Walls of Fairy, and are the Unseelie returned to their prison?  I could go on for quite a while and not run out of MAJOR issues.<br /><br />But she's not JUST wrapping up the whole series.  She's also doing a lot of worldbuilding, because apparently she's going to keep writing in the FEVER world, and so while she's patiently giving us one answer after another, she's also busy expanding the universe, introducing MORE characters, hinting at new problems.  For example: We meet at least four of the \\"Nine\\" who stormed the Abbey with Barrons at the beginning of DREAMFEVER.  That means more personalities who need to make their mark on the plot, more characters to track.  We get new people at the Abbey, too, and more detail about the world beyond Dublin.<br /><br />But she's not JUST wrapping up the whole series AND laying the groundwork for new books, she's ALSO writing a reunion novel.  Because all of the MacKeltars from the Highlander books make, at least, cameo appearances here.  The wives show up, too, and all their kids.<br /><br />I do not think that this would be the way to go if I didn't know that many of KMM's fans, myself included, actually wanted and needed precisely this book.  Like I said, Barrons doing tax returns - sign me up.  Barrons reading his morning paper -- sure, I'm there.  Barrons at the laundromat, waiting for his socks to dry -- awesome, that one's got potential.<br /><br />But here's the thing.  After I finished I...immediately sat down and re-read the book.  And then I liked it WAY MORE.  On my first read through I was so desperate for answers that I just zoomed along, gobbling them up.  But on my second go-around, I paid more attention and let each scene and sequence pull me in, and realized how balanced the book is, how well-done.  This novel sprawls, but it's a well-crafted sprawl, and if you tease out individual storylines they're solid and coherent.<br /><br />It's hard to say more without spoilers - it's definitely an emotional roller coaster, that's vague enough.  I started out feeling really attached to these characters, and I finished hoping I'd be able to see more of them in the future.  I really, really hope that Mac will re-appear in future Fever novels, because I'll miss her if she doesn't.more characters to track.

Well, I'm ordering Gossip in the Grain next, then his new one.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|The extended version of this movie made me a bigger fan of Ms. Jolie and the work she does.  This version explained more of what made \\"Salt\\" who she was and why she did the things she did.  The undercurrent of the movies was simply, \\"because you are the bad guy, doesn't always mean you are the \\"bad\\" guy.
B0041V1R7O|5.0|Like practically all the albums that I consider my favorites, this album took some time to grow on me. It may take a few listens to appreciate it for how great it is, but it's worth it, and is steadily climbing on my iTunes to one of my most played albums.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I was fired up to read this book with all the hype surrounding it.  So I dust off the kindle, download and prepare for the promised ride.  The ride was short, confusing and seemed to be on flat tires.  Maybe I should have gotten it before the hype.  Sliced bread it is not.
B000W20NXU|5.0|Maybe the greatest voice ever. A solid album that makes me wanna sit in the corner of a dark bar and smoke a cigarette while it rains outside. And I don't smoke. I guess what I'm trying to say is it's awesome.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|So bad, on so many levels, not the least of which is the casting. If you can stomach the lightweight wimp McWhateverHisNameIs, you just might be able to hack submarine duty yourself. But I doubt it. It's an insult to even mention this heap of garbage within earshot of Das Boot(oops, sorry), the best war film ever made. Hollywood is incapable of making a REAL war movie, partly because war has never come to this country, but mostly because Hollywood is concerned with \\"entertainment,\\" not art. All copies of this should be confiscated and sent to the bottom of the ocean, along with the director and pitiful actors.
0446195529|5.0|I love the series! None of the Camel Club books have disappointed me. Sometimes I wonder how much better a place the world would be if there were really such honorable men as Oliver Stone in the world. But down to facts, beyond the obligatory belly-aching about how we can never put the book down once started (me included - finished it in two sittings), this book serves up an Oliver Stone Tour de Force. Oliver is supported by his familiar band of characters but it does border on an Oliver Stone solo act. I could see a case where this was intentional by the author. Now that the Camel Club is sans computer expert, it is harder to find as much info with a simple plot device as an Internet search. This book is missing a typical mainstay of many Baldacci books - the sub-plot. The plot is 100% focused on Oliver. Nothing like Annabel's Mother's death like last time. I actually went from each chapter without finding any superfluous story lines. The plot keeps the reader guessing and I must say, the book lacked the foreshadowing of others (I didn't figure it out until 3 pages before the reveal). If you want a great escape and to catch up with some old friends, you cannot go wrong with this one. Now that we know how much the Government knows about Oliver--he has to be considered the devil you know. Lord knows they wouldn't may an enemy out of John Carr--would they?
B0040ZA2D6|4.0|Though I may live in a cave (a.k.a. I do not have cable or satellite t.v.), I have been following the Nickelodeon show, Big Time Rush for some time now. I first saw it when I was baby sitting for a neighbor of mine. I have been watching it on nick.com ever since. Although I find it confusing that they became a group in real life because of the t.v. series and they use their fictional group's songs as their own in real life, I love Big Time Rush's music. I love cleverly written lyrics and music, but I also enjoy fun, upbeat tunes such as the ones included on this album. This is the type of boy band I needed when I was a ten year old listening to Nsync. They have the good boy band traits (poppy and upbeat)without exposing their listeners to suggestive themes and such. I do have a slight problem with a couple of the themes simply because they may be too shallow, but they are not over the top. All in all, this is fun music to enjoy without worrying about listening to with young kids and feeling like a kid. Although all these guys are at least twenty years old, the songs have a youthful sound to them, which I love.     The stand out tracks for me are \\"Till I Forget About You\\", \\"Nothing Even Matters\\" and \\"Big Night\\". The tracks that do not impress me very much are \\"Oh Yeah\\" and \\"Boyfriend\\".    Something I do not like about this album is that it does not contain all the songs from the show such as \\"Any Kind of Guy\\".
B004AHNIGM|4.0|I was excited when I heard Gregg was doing a solo cd.Having followed Gregg solo and with the Bros. for years I knew he was still great. However when I saw that T Bone Burnett was producing it my heart sank. T Bone has such a heavy hand and seems to take pleasure in turning everything so low and slow that it all seems like lounge music.  His  production on Ryan Bingham's Junky star comes to mind.Having listened to Low Country Blues..Im sad to say T Bone has done it again. Gregg sounds great, his voice sounds clear and his phrasing is right on. But the playing on this cd is so tame.. so muted that it doesnt merit Greggs talents.Gregg, Duane and the band set the bar for revitalizing the Blues and presenting them in a new a creative way. It would have been great to see more of that creativity in these  arrangements.I wasnt expecting an Allmanesque set  here either. With all props to Gregg I love his other solo outings.And I understand having T Bone on board gets you a bit of automatic critical acclaim.Which Gregg deserves anyhow.I would have preferred more Gregg less T Bone. That being said this is still Gregg Allman Im giving him 4 stars for that....Plus songs like Another Rider and Devil got my woman as well as Floating bridge are great. So buy it. And enjoy. And imagine how great it would have been with a little less of the T Bone vibe.
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|Eclipse is the best movie yet of the Twilight series.  Good acting and great action scenes.  Good tension in the love triangle.  The special effects porttion of the DVD is very interesting and entertaining - almost as good as watching the movie.

Patti Smith's persistently simple view of the world is profound, moving and accessible. A must read for anyone interested in art making,  anyone who has fantasized about the Bohemian life, anyone looking for their soul mate.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This game is by far my favourite game of all time. The story is well-written and implemented. The puzzles are quite fun, even though not too challenging. I played this game 3 days straight - almost literally.  The replay value is part of the story, which can be annoying to some. In the end it was a great experience and I wish I could experience it the same way again. This game is an absolute pick-up if you can handle reading lots of words.

0545265355|5.0|I bought these books for my 14 year old son after I read about them in a magazine.  He loved them and then gave them to me to read.  I enjoyed them as well.  They are interesting, different without being too over the top, and keep you interested the whole way through.  We can't wait to see more from this author.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|So you've read that it's huge and unless you have a wide case, it ain't fittin.  How wide? 7.5 inches at least.  And if there is a fan directly above it, you won't be usin that fan anymore cuz it won't fit.  And you'll have to take your motherboard out to install it.. even if you have a cut out(unless it's a really really huge cutout)    But I think the heat sink alone cools my chip to about 30 C(86 F) at idle cuz if I turn the fans way up or way down it doesn't seem to make too much difference.  Of course I do have two big old 120mm fans on it that don't have to spin that fast to make a huge difference so I could be wrong...    Point is.. I overclocked my phenom II X4 B55 from 3.2Ghz to 3.7 and the temperatures at heavy load (prime95) are 41C(105F).  And that's with a wimpy 1200RPM on the fans.  They can go to 2000RPM.  With the fans all the way up it stays the same.  I could have sworn it was doing better before... anyway.  You can't really ask for better temps than that.  A 17% overclock and running prime95 (prime95 is a stress test that really works your CPU HARD!) and it's still cooler than my i5 gets on normal load in my macbook pro.  Sweet!    I do have great airflow in my case and it is winter, so that helps a lot.  But these are extreme settings on my CPU and this thing handles it.  It deserves its five stars.
B004AKCME8|3.0|Legend of the Guardians is a wonderful series of books by Lasky, but the movie was a great disappointment.  While it was entertaining, the story is changed a great deal from the books.  So much of the storyline is swept aside it is like a totally different story with the same charactors.  It is best if you see the movie first without reading the books and then you will perhaps not be as disappointed.  The books are fantastic and a quick and enjoyable read.
0321647440|4.0|This is a great book but if you follow the instructions to import practice images from the DVD some of them are missing. The images ARE on the DVD but you have to follow the instructions given in Amazeme1's review below.

B0040JHXTI|5.0|What a huge treat this box set is!  Having a new collection of Springsteen songs from the Darkness era is a treasure.  Being able to witness the creative genius in his song-writing process, the dedication, the commitment to excellence, is eye-opening.  Seeing all the guys in their younger years is amazing.  Simply put, any Bruce fan must have this in his/her collection.  What we learn about Bruce and the E-Street Band has only been talked about, never seen before.  This window into the world of these incredible musicians is rare, completely open and revealing.  Don't miss it.
0802798225|5.0|What a fun read \\"Perfect Chemistry\\" by Simone Elkeles is!  I enjoyed reading Perfect Chemistry very much because it was such a cute high school romance story about the \\"perfect\\" pom-pom girl, Brittany Ellis, and the Latino Blood gang member, Alex, who had the reputation for being the most dangerous guy in school.  The Fairfield high school is cross cultural with the uppity rich kids from the North and the poor drug-dealing gang members from the south.  The Chemistry teacher and principal are determined to get the kids to learn from each other.<br /><br />When Brittany and Alex are paired together as partners in Chemistry it takes them awhile before they feel comfortable with each other to actually work together.  Although the plot is simplistic and predictable, it's a fun read because of the characters, the humor and a great ending.  I liked Alex better than Brittany because he seemed to have more love and respect for his family than Brittany had for her parents.<br /><br />Alex also struggled with deeper decisions whereas Brittany's biggest decision was which guy she should go with--the jock that everyone expected her to like or Alex who she was attracted to and really liked.  I think the author did a good job at presenting both sides of Brittany and Alex--their caring and loving natures as well as the superficial ones they presented to the world.<br /><br />I really liked this book because I like stories about teens, school and interesting characters.  Brittany and Alex discovered that stereotypes are not always right and were surprised to discover that they had more in common than they would have ever imagined as they got to know each other better and actually became friends and lovers.  This book addresses the issues of image, popularity, premarital sex, family, dealing with cerebral palsy, judging by appearances, teaching and gangs.  I didn't care for the foul language interspersed throughout the book or the fact that premarital sex was taken so lightly, but it reflected the general attitude of most high schoolers.  I am so glad I read \\"Perfect Chemistry\\" and highly recommend it to anyone who likes YA fiction/romance.general attitude of most high schoolers.

142311339X|4.0|I am no stranger to Mr. Riordan's work.  I own the Percy Jackson series, The Red Pyramid, and of course The Lost Hero (All of which are excellent books)  I was very excited to hear that Rick was returning to Camp Half Blood with a new series involving new prophecies and characters, while keeping many of the old characters that we came to love in the Percy Jackson series.  After reading this book, it's evident to say that Rick hasn't lost his touch at weaving a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I loved the characters and various subplots that wove together into fun adventure.    My favorite character of the new cast of demigods has to be Leo.  What can I say?  I'm always partial to the ones who make me laugh in stories.  I also liked the fact the backstories of these demigods was darker in nature.  Personally, I felt Leo had the roughest time of three and that could have also played a factor into why I loved him so much.  Getting the chance to watch him grow over time and develop a sense of friendship and family.  Jason's character was a little sketchy at times but that was to be expected considering that he couldn't remember who he was.  Piper, well...she was kind of annoying.  Her thoughts and feeling were so caught up on Jason but like I said, it was to be expected considering who she represents as a demigod.  I look forward to reading The Son of Neptune when it comes out this fall.    Now on to why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5.  Let me just first say that I reviewed every Rick Riordan book I read and gave them all 5 stars because that's what they deserved.  With this book, I had take away a star because of the writing.  Something with the writing style faltered with me.  All of his prior stories were told in the first person and he exceeded at this.  This was his first attempt in the third person person perspective, and I'm sorry to say, it showed.  I felt it could have been written better considering that he's no stranger to writing books.This is his seventh children's book and he has a couple of adult books under his belt too.    That's the curse of being a sucessful writer, I guess.  The fans expect every aspect of the book to be above the bar from its predecessor.
B004DK49DW|2.0|The first track on \\"Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes\\" instantly convinces you that Social Distortion has still got \\"it\\" and hasn't lost their way in the past few years. Unfortunately, the rest of the album does its best to change your mind. Some of the songs are great, but the sound of the recording is deplorably over-produced. Compared to all earlier Social Distortion albums, it's sad to hear something this generic and boring.
B004HAG40O|5.0|I have to say I really enjoyed this album.  It's the kind where as soon as you finish it you want to listen to it again, which I did.  That's fairly easy to do when it's about 40 minutes long.<br /><br />Not that I didn't like \\"Hazards of Love,\\" but a sprawling, interconnected album really needs you to be in the right mood and to have enough time to listen to it all the way through in one sitting.  It's also annoying when you want to cherry-pick a few tracks to put on your MP3 player.<br /><br />No such problem with this album.  I don't own the first couple Decemberists albums, but I do own the Tarkio retrospective, which was the alt-country band Colin Meloy fronted before the Decemberists and much of \\"The King is Dead\\" seems like it would fit with that group.  There's less of the accordions and \\"seafaring\\" sound as well as no cute 18th/19th Century references.<br /><br />Hard to say what my favorite tracks are, but unlike \\"Hazards of Love\\" I suspect I will have a few that will make it onto my MP3 player.  If you like alt-country or Americana music, then give this a listen.<br /><br />That is all.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I was afraid to start reading this because I have been disappointed by series endings before, but KMM drew me in again and answered my questions with series, wrapped up cliff hangers and satisfied me with the ending, without leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Don't read this book unless you have read the other four, which also benefit from some of her Highlander series. (I'm now ready for Christian Keltar's story.)
B002ECJZ76|5.0|This is a lovely film, enjoyable by boys and girls of all ages! The protagonist is a little hard to take at first, but changes, and therefore worth seeing. Perhaps parents might like to evaluate the initial harshness of that character before allowing really little children to see the film.  S. Rosso

B001EN71DG|5.0|I don't think I need to do a review on the movies themseleves since there are so many already. But to prevent confusion the box with Luke and Vadar in mid light saber duel with a blue aura around them have the original theatrical release of the movies on the bonus discs. Amazon for some reason (Probably a deal with Lucas) combines all the reviews for every version of the trilogy into one so you will see the same reviews for different versions.

0634022296|4.0|This is a GREAT book for rhythm guitarists to strum along with, and a great tool for singers to have the lyrics uncluttered by staff notation. Very useful at impromptu parties and unplugged gigs !!!    PLUSES: All the songs are in the correct keys, unlike many Beatles songbooks. And the chord diagrams really help illustrate some of those weird fingering positions, but fill in those magical Beatle passing chords that make the songs great.    MINUSES: The physical format. As noted in many other reviews, being it is obviously geared to rhythm guitarists, the book should be able to lay open and flat, but the binding prohibits that. MY SUGGESTION: do what I did and take it to an office supply store, have then peel the hard-binding and insert a spiral binding. It makes navigating through it a breeze (it's in MOSTLY alphabetical order, with a few songs swithched around a slot or two) and it will lay open on any flat surface or stand.    The only other \\"minus\\" is that it's missing some of the songs the Beatles did not write, but released as cover versions.

1608191664|5.0|If you have liked H-J Chang's _Bad Samaritans_, you will most likely to like _23 Things_.    Their angles are different, however.  _Bad Samaritans_ concentrates on the developmental history of today's wealth countries, ranging from Britain to South Korea.  The author summarizes a common set of developmental policies they have used during industrialization:  Heavy dose of government intervention, ranging from subsidies to tariffs.  By contrast, _23 Things_ concentrates less on a particular economic subject.  Instead, it makes a wide angle approach, ranging from the impact of washing machines to myths of globalization.  Similar to _Bad Samaritans_, _23 Things_ also reminds its readers that there is no such thing as a free market.    Even more so than _Bad Samaritans_, I highly recommend _23 Things_ to those who are looking for a book on economics that is particularly well-suited to generalists and something that could be read completely in a day or two.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|Sidhe-Seer Mac Lane is stuck in the Silvers, her dead protector beast at her feet and this time, this time she may not survive the grief. She's lost the one person - the final person - the only person who she just now realizes she won't live without. Choices, Mac...it's all about choices. And Mac 5.0 is born.<br /><br />This sleeker, smarter, far deadlier MacKayla Lane is released on Dublin as the search for the Sinsar Dubh and the race to save the world rockets towards its final chapters. Through grief, through loss, through torture and pain, through rebirth, with questions - endless questions - and difficult, unbelievable, inconceivable answers, this epic battle between gigantic forces teeters on the fulcrum of the sheer determination of one young woman and the monstrous forces impacting her.<br /><br />Five books. One epic journey. And a conclusion that satisfies beyond my wildest dreams.<br /><br />I don't know that I have the words to express my impressions of [[ASIN:B003EY7IRC Shadowfever]] on its own merits, and I don't know that I should even try, because for me, this isn't about a book, it's about the story that takes place over the arc of all of the books. It's about MacKayla Lane, who I haven't always liked, as she evolves from the bubble-headed Amateur Sleuth Barbie, self absorbed and overly entitled, to Mac Lane-O'Connor, weapon for revenge for her sister's murder and to hell with the world at large, to my favorite incarnation: Just Mac. It's about growing up, making choices, and fighting the good fight. It's about deciding, and acknowledging, who you are and what you really want - and then going out with both hands and grabbing it by the short and curlies until it's yours.<br /><br />It's about life, and responsibility, and love, and hate, and good, and most definitely evil. It's about a book that can unmake the world and the people who join together to fight for that world. It's about picking up the pieces and finding joy in the cracks. It's about stasis. And change.<br /><br />It's about life, death, and everything - absolutely everything in the shadows between.<br /><br />With an indescribable quality of writing, imaginative world building and creation that leaves me in awe, and characters that go beyond three dimensional to that iconic fourth dimension that jettisons them from the page, Karen Marie Moning has created an unforgettable, intensely layered story that will forever hold a place in my heart as one of the best in the genre - ever. And she's done it brilliantly.<br /><br />I'm so glad I went back and re-read the first four books before I started this one, because the depth and texture of the overall experience, fresh in my mind, is something I wouldn't trade for anything. I am, quite simply put, humbled by the breadth and scope of the intricacies and delicacies of the tale, and I'm still shaking at some of the more in-your-face truths and truisms. Moning created this world, this broken, flawed, wrong world, filled it with all the darkness, light, danger, hope, threat, life, debauchery, laughter, murder, rebirth, chaos, and love, and gave it to her readers to embrace. And she did it with exquisite aplomb.<br /><br />When I force myself to take a critical look at the book, examine the pieces and the construction and ignore the heady weight of the story, I can muster some more objective commentary. I freely admit the series in general and this book in particular could have been trimmed a bit here and there. There were times throughout the series when the pacing of the narrative dragged from superlative information dumping, when it crossed that deadly line between brilliant creation and mental overload and the mythos got truly overwhelming. And yeah, twist my arm, I think that the answers to at least some of the questions introduced at the very beginning could've been better seeded throughout the series, instead of slamming them all into this book. It might have made the first four books a bit less frustrating at times. But maybe that would've taken away from some of the intensity of their reveal. I don't know.<br /><br />And if I'm to be completely honest, I wasn't always fond of Mac. In fact, through most of the series - including this book - I didn't like her. I found her immature and purposely obtuse and willfully oblivious, even as late as the middle of this book. Occasionally, she just flat out got on my nerves. I don't know that I would confidently say that I believe her character being the woman I could realistically see the mighty and mysterious Jericho Z. Barrons wanting. But hey, the heart wants what the heart wants, and there are certainly too few rainbows in the Z's past.<br /><br />One true complaint, though, one genuine pea under the princess's bed: Dani. I wasn't a huge fan of her POV in the previous book, but I liked her character and the development that she was afforded. Everything about her in this book, though, I found jarring and unlikable and ultimately, inconsequential. Even her dialogue seemed off. I couldn't wrap my head around why she was in any of the scenes, and didn't like it when she was. I kept expecting there to be some tie-in, some connection to her past, some answers for her tragic childhood, some excuse for her existence. I didn't find any beyond one bizarre thread that came out of nowhere and was never resolved.<br /><br />But even with that, even with the other minor issues, I loved this book and thank Karen Marie Moning from the bottom of my book-loving heart for giving us this series, these characters, and this wild and wicked, and sometimes wonderfully horrifying world that is the Fever series. I don't know where that world goes from here. Frankly, I don't care. If waiting the seemingly interminable wait for [[ASIN:B003EY7IRC Shadowfever]] taught me one thing, it's confidence in Moning as an author and as a purveyor of sheer reading entertainment. I'll keep to the lights until she gives us more. Of whatever it is she's going to give us next.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Fever series to be read in its entirety and in order (Moning's Highlanders are in this book and knowing them from her romance series helps but isn't strictly necessary):<br />[[ASIN:B000MAH7SQ Darkfever: The Fever Series]]<br />[[ASIN:B000W967HO Bloodfever: The Fever Series]]<br />[[ASIN:B0013TPUSO Faefever: The Fever Series]]<br />[[ASIN:B002LDM8WW Dreamfever: The Fever Series]]<br />[[ASIN:B003EY7IRC Shadowfever]]<br /><br />Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.the intensity of their reveal.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|I originaly saw this formidable epic on Stars HD last year. I found myself waiting in anticipation for the following weeks episode.  Really!  That hasn't happened since Saturday Night Live, 36 years ago.  The 4 DVDs are interrupted only by opening and closing credits. This series is TV RAW at it's very finest.  With such a blood/sex bath approach you might assume plot and character developement would be of much lesser concern... That would be a wrong assumption.  The multi layered story line and character developement are what drives the series.  You will find yourself drawn in by the literal use of language, spectacle, brutality, and yes, buckets of blood and full frontal nudity. Lot's of it... The show never fails to deliver, from the first episode through to the last of 13 episodes.  Whether or not the depiction of Roman lifestyle is accurate or not doesn't matter.  It feels right.  The costumes, and lack of them, the depth of stylized dialog, and the debauchery of ancient Rome are delivered in an artistic, graphic, and captivating manner.  This series will attack your sensibilities and attract your full attention!  Don't Turn Away From Your Set!  Six Stars easy...
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I finished this book less than 24 hours from it downloading to my Kindle and it was amazing.  Of the series, this was definitely the best book by far.  A lot of twists and turns that were unexpected and surprising.        ******SPOILERS******    The beginning of the book is stronger than the end, in my opinion, as Mac deals with Barron's death and her newfound resolve to excoriate weakness inside herself.  The first chapter was very moving and engrossing from the start.    The realization of what Mac actually was became a little anti-climactic after a while.  The realization that she wasn't supposed to exist was really phenomenal but then the reader is led to think she's one thing which isn't true and I was actually disappointed by that.  I would have preferred that that particular plot line had been the true thread.    One of the things I was waiting for, as a reader, was for Mac to come into her own and be able to understand and use her powers.  It seemed she was always teetering on the brink of actually doing that in this book.  Always one step away from really being a force to be reckoned with but never actually getting there.  That was a bit of a disappointment.    I loved how her and Barrons were able to resolve their \\"issues\\" and had a very satisfying conclusion to their relationship.  So well done.    One thing that was slightly irritating and only became gratingly so the further into the book I read, was the annoying habit of Ms. Moning to end a chapter with a fantastic cliffhanger and then, when the page is turned, she's taken up on some tangent such as \\"So when I was twelve my parents bought me a bike.\\"  I grew increasingly frustrated as a reader since it happened again and again and again throughout the book.  The least a writer could do, besides give a great cliffhanger, is resolve it in an equally satisfying way.    Overall, a very satisfying end to an extraordinary and creative series that I will remember for a very long time.  Thank you for writing,Ms. Moning.
6304698542|2.0|Cabaret is not aging well.  Aside from Joel Grey's weird and fascinating Master of Ceremonies and a couple of catchy tunes this 38 year old movie, long considered a masterful classic by people who probably haven't watched it in 25 years, is one of the most over-rated movies of all time, in my extensive viewing experience.    Liza Minelli's greatest gift was as a dancer.  She moves well and is pleasing to the eye, but that's where her range meets its limits.  She is not a good actress, she mugs at the camera, slurs her words, tosses off lines like a teen-age valley girl (remember this is supposed to be Berlin in 1931), belts out every song in her raucous out-of-tune singing and is generally annoying in the extreme in all of her scenes, and she's in most of them in this long, boring flick.    Bob Fosse's choreography is very catchy and clever and well-danced but his direction of the film is clumsy.  There are some second rate bloops in evidence as well, such as the female band not really playing their instruments in cync with the soundtrack.  In fact in the last sequence their physical actions do not match the sound track in the very least.    Michael York is a good choice for the Isherwood alter-ego, Brian, but he's helpless in the face of the banal and emotionally empty script.  Helmut Griem and Marisa Berenson are completely wasted but they provide some mighty beautiful human scenery to watch.    I liked this movie when I was 20, it was, for the times, risqué and colorful and the tunes were toe-tappers, especially Mein Herr.  But now, decades later, Cabaret seems an empty vessel, a cracked mirror and a shabby piece of film-making with the smack of a Disney feature for gay men and transvestites.  The coy gayness of Cabaret is really off-putting, but then in 1972 guys were still nervous about being openly homosexual, hence the Michael York/Helmut Griem strange sea-changes in their personas after they've been to bed together, as if they thought they'd made a huge mistake or something.       I give Cabaret two stars for Joel Grey's performance, Fosse's choreography, the six lead dancers, and the set design of the lovely old European boarding house, and Griem's and Berenson's faces.
1416550550|4.0|The story unfolds like an intricately woven braid....told over 100 years and by three different characters.  We get to read the past and present of the story slowly reveal the mystery of how a little girl arrived in Australia from England with no knowledge of who she was or why she was there.    The suspense and mystery deepens and slowly builds to the last page.  A wonderful read to go to every night.  The story is complicated, and you will go back a chapter or two to give context to what you are reading - but it's enjoyable and fun.  Kept me in suspense until the end.    The author uses wonderful descriptions of the \\"forgotten garden\\" and the Cornish landscape.  Really set a wonderful scene and I kept looking at the map of the Blackhurst Estate to imagine better what I was reading.  Made me long to build such a garden, maze and cottage.    Definitely recommend.
B003UESJH4|5.0|My review was written after viewing this remarkable movie on opening day at the theater. It was sensed then that it would be a contender (winner) of Best Picture. Now the DVD is available. I buy it to again view this winner; a movie my wife wants to watch daily. The music is as good as the acting and story.<br /><br />The DVD provides SUBTITLES and an all film extra bonus assortment that is as great as the feature itself, also about as long. A comentary version, a filmed story about this Inspirational time and people, a Q&A filmed program with the director and several of the cast, 2 real King Geo VI speeches showing that Firth did an even more remarkable job as portraying Bertie, a filmed story about the real Lionel Logue with surprising details and information, and even an emotional plug in video form from the Stuttering Foundation. All worth a look. The bonus material is worth the purchase price.<br /><br />Review from the theater viewing:<br />This movie removes the chasm between the Monarch and common people. An emotional look at a personal struggle of the man who would become king. A speech defect is the problem. King Geo VI role and literally his life is so well played by Colin Firth (well known for many British period dramas) that the viewer becomes a part of the close family of this man and his strife. You will feel an abundance of emotional elements, sadness to laughter.<br /><br />Firth will no doubt continue to win awards for this portrayal, but another man deserves as much. Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue, the man who helped the king speak, is as endearing in his performance as Firth. Helen Bonham Carter makes a beautiful, loving, supportive wife, and eventual Queen Elizabeth. Although the part is small for an actor giant like Derek Jacobi, he plays a memorable Archbishop. Jacobi is better known as Cadfael, a period series worth a viewing.<br /><br />One does not have to be British, a scholar of the Monarchy, or even a lover of period drama to enjoy this film. It is an inspirational tale of accepting, facing, and overcoming a handicap. That is never out of date, never old. \\"The King's Speech\\" is the freshest approach to the task as I have seen. It is also one of the best Monarchy stories I have viewed, and I'm a Brit History DVD fan and own dozens upon dozens.<br /><br />The theater viewing audience cheered and clapped for this film through the end credits. A well received story. Highly recommended.accepting, facing, and overcoming a handicap.

B004DK49DW|4.0|Not their best album, but it's good to have some new tunes.    What kept this from being 5 stars:  -The background vocals... I do not see the gospel singers necessary, and they actually can make you want to change the track to another one at times.  -\\"Farside of Nowhere\\" had me confused, was this a Social D album or Cheryl Crow?    Other than that, it's good to see SxDx again. It may take some getting used to their new sound... but give it a listen.
078322334X|3.0|**This review may contain spoilers**<br /><br />\\"The Lost World\\" (hereafter TLW) is the epitome of the \\"Idiot Plot\\" movie. As defined by critic Roger Ebert, an \\"Idiot Plot\\" movie is one that has \\"..a plot that requires all the characters to be idiots. If they weren't, they'd immediately figure out everything and the movie would be over.\\" Oh, where to start with the inanities this movie's characters commits? From the beginning, I suppose:<br /><br />1. Industrialist Hammond (Richard Attenborough) recruits the decidedly cynical intellectual Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to keep tabs on occasional scientist/girlfriend Sarah Harding(Juliette Moore) as she investigates the breeding dinosaur colony on Site B island. Wouldn't more physically adventurous and pragmatic Alan Grant (Sam O'Neill) be a more logical choice?<br /><br />2. Sarah is supposed to study the dinosaurs unobtrusively. So why does she bring a laboratory trailer the size of a boxcar with which to crash through the jungle?<br /><br />3. Moore's scientist startles an infant stegosaurus with a noisy flash camera and nearly gets decapitated by an infuriated adult's spiked tail.<br /><br />4. Ian's high-maintenance brat daughter Kelly (Vanessa Carter) stows away on the trip to Site B and jeopardizes Ian's safety by wanting to go into the \\"high hide\\" (a suspended cage) when two tyrannosaurs decide to visit the lab trailer.<br /><br />5. The two tyrannosaurs decide to visit the lab trailer because solicitous photographer Nick (Vince Vaughn) brings their injured infant for Sarah to set its fractured leg. As a reward for their benevolent humanitarianism, the lab trailer is hurled off a cliff, with Ian, Sarah, and Nick nearly following suit.<br /><br />6. Ian and company free the dinosaurs that were captured in the round-up conducted by InGen's mercenaries for transport to a San Diego zoo. As a reward for their benevolent humanitarianism, the animals stampede and destroy all communication with the outside world, forcing the two enemies to join forces to travel to the interior towards an abandoned radar post.<br /><br />7. An InGen mercenary strays from the group into unknown wilderness to urinate. A herd of tiny Compsognathus fatally mutilate him. Another mercenary would have heard him, if not for his MP3 headphones.<br /><br />8. For some inexplicable reason, Sarah takes a blood-soaked denim jacket and hangs it within her tent, allowing one of the tyrannosaurs to track and nearly slaughter all the group.<br /><br />9. Supposedly wilderness-experienced mercenaries allow themselves to be picked off by velociraptors in tall grass.<br /><br />10. Why wasn't the captured tyrannosaurus properly tranquilized on the abortive trip to San Diego? Sarah mumbles something about not being able to calibrate the dosage properly. However, when the tyrannosaur is corralled back into the ship, Sarah fires a tranquilizer dart into him. Why didn't she do that earlier and prevent the theropod's San Diego rampage?<br /><br />11. The tyrannosaur visits a house with a swimming pool to satisfy its thirst. The family inside takes a picture of him with another noisy flash camera right in the eyes. The tyrannosaur roars (and presumably kills the family).<br /><br />12. Hammond's villainous nephew (Arliss Howard) steals the infant brought to lure the tyrannosaur back and brings it to the ship. The tyrannosaur traps him there, cripples him, and lets the infant practice his killing skills.<br /><br />13. Towards the end of the movie, Hammond mentions that the Site B dinosaurs \\"require our absence\\" in order to flourish. Now he tells us!<br /><br />Despite this cavalcade of stupidity, I have a grudging affection for TLW and even own it on VHS. After all, we should be grateful the characters teased the dinosaurs because those ancient, resuscitated beasts were quite spectacular, and dynamic, and were the raison d'etre for TLW at all!or towards an abandoned radar post.    7.

The tyrannosaur roars (and presumably kills the family).    12. Hammond's villainous nephew (Arliss Howard) steals the infant brought to lure the tyrannosaur back and brings it to the ship. The tyrannosaur traps him there, cripples him, and lets the infant practice his killing skills.    13. Towards the end of the movie, Hammond mentions that the Site B dinosaurs \\"require our absence\\" in order to flourish. Now he tells us!    Despite this cavalcade of stupidity, I have a grudging affection for TLW and even own it on VHS. After all, we should be grateful the characters teased the dinosaurs because those ancient, resuscitated beasts were quite spectacular, and dynamic, and were the raison d'etre for TLW at all!
0060936223|5.0|Many reviews mention the name dropping, some positively, some negatively.  I found the various celebrities and characters mentioned to be an important part of the narrative with no gratuitous intent.  This is a memoir of two friends with a relationship deeper than I have ever encountered in writing.  Their lives were woven with so many interconnected pieces and important cultural movements, yet Patti and Robert kept their relationship and art at the center of their lives. Thank you Patti for putting it all out there.
B000006NPY|3.0|Actually, there's only a handful of decent to very good songs on this cd. The rest of just slow, rambling, pretentious crap (in my opinion). You're better off just getting a best of cd, as the good ones are on there for the most part. This is such a slow boring snoozer it's amazing the praise it's garnered. Highlight of the whole album is X.Y.U. It really showcases all the strong points of the musicians talent and Corgan's skill with composing lyrics. As for the majority of this, the lyrics seem to stumble into simple minded obvious ramblings. Just didn't connect with this one as I did with S.D. and Gish. If you want rage and emotional power, get the aformentioned cd's. If you want a nap, get this one.
0060775858|5.0|Goodnight comb, goodnight brush, goodnight nobody, goodnight mush. And goodnight to the old lady whispering \\"hush\\".    Love the simple rhyming flow of this book. While I think the illustrations leave something to be desired... There is no doubt this book is a keeper that we will enjoy reading for many years.
B0044XV3R8|3.0|I was never overwhelmed by Aliens 5, featuring Sigourney Weaver battling the corporation trying to exploit aliens for world domination, with the help of a few good marines.  But despite the Hippee whiny crap, it was a well executed movie.  This dvd copy is pants on head retarded though. I don't need them to offer me an intermission in a movie, and the fact that they used one to cover up a disc change drives me nuts.  After 2 hours, you fuse to the sofa.  Getting up change a disc is really annoying, since now you need to find the lights, swap the disc, and then wait for everyone to come back from where ever they wonder off to.  And before you say that \\"Intermissions are supposed to get people up and moving,\\" the fact is in our society to day, we can sit in one place for 8 hours without moving, so it is not hard to sit for 178 min.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could NOT stop reading this book... I basically sat down and read it cover to cover. This dystopian tale is amazing, and pretty believable! I could totally see everything that was going on in the story in my head. FANTASTIC! I recommend it to anyone to likes anything, because me and my mom have very different tastes in books, but she loves it. It's the kind of book you just fall in love with from page 1.
B00436GNVC|1.0|My mouth dropped open when I started to play this disc (which I was eagerly awaiting, since I LOVED Rockferry so much)...and it did not drop open in a good way. I can't believe this is the same artist. Her voice is shrill, the beats are maddening, and it is basically just a lot of \\"pop vomit\\"... so disappointed. Couldn't even listen beyond the first few tracks. Hopefully she goes back to the original \\"formula\\" for album #3... every great artist has a dud, and I'm afraid this is it.
030726999X|3.0|I love Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist however I have to admit I slogged through the first 300 or so pages of this book.  I consider the second book my favorite of the series and obviously this is a must read to conclude the stories of these characters and it is a worthy, strongly wrapped-up conclusion.  However, it didn't inspire the urgency to finish it as the other two books did for me.  Good book but not my favorite of the series.  I will miss Lisbeth though.  I truly felt I knew her after it was all done and that's a tribute to Larsson's dedication to these characters.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|I was weiry to watch this movie because most remakes fall very very short of the original. Either they attempt to duplicated expecting modern graphics to bring in a lot of hype, or rewrite the original story and just totally wreck the whole things. I didn't go and see this at the theater because that's what I expected from this movie being bias and all... I was a huge fan of the original A-team in the day. But I must say they did a pretty good job with this movie. The actors did an excellent job. There was no cloning, they took the characters and made them there own. Some of the action scenes were a bit much, but hey, so was the original. All in all I was quite impressed.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Machete is the kind of movie where you pretty much know going into it whether you're going to like it or not. If you think the idea of seeing Danny Trejo kill a bunch of people with a machete is cool then you will like this movie. If you don't think the ideo of seeing Danny Trejo kill a bunch of people with a machete is cool (shame on you!), then you won't like this movie. Machete, along with last years The Expendables and Piranha, proved that violent movies could still make a buck at the box-office. And I hope that many more movies of this nature are released in the near future. Machete and the other aforementioned movies sure are a breath of fresh air with all the Twilights and Harry Potters flooding the multiplexes. The cast of Machete is simply awesome! Seeing Trejo, Robert De Niro, Jessica Alba (in her best performance to date), Michelle Rodriguez, Lindsay Lohan, and James Fahey, among others, all in the same movie is great. And I can't wait for the sequel. Bring on Machete Kills!
B0029O08WA|4.0|I purchased New Moon Soundtrack because I enjoyed the music on the movie.  I enjoyed the music in all three released films (to date) so I have all three soundtracks and for those who are not only a fans of the movies but the music, well you simply must have the soundtrack for your collection.
0393072231|5.0|The Big Short tells the story of the sub-prime mortgage meltdown from the angle of a few small hedge fund managers who saw it coming and made millions when it did. It's hard to begrudge these small Wall Street players their payoff, as they held their bets and saw something coming that everyone else -- the major Wall Street and European firms, politicians, consumers -- all thought would never happen. A smooth writer, Lewis is able to break down how the mortgages were repackaged and resold to the point where almost everyone was confused as to how risky they were. The ratings agencies come off as dull-witted, if not criminally incompetent. I found the saddest part to be the end, where Lewis points out that the hedge fund managers who saw the meltdown coming made millions, but so did many of the Wall Street managers who insisted it could never happen. The only real losers were the taxpayers. For more in-depth book reviews I've done, search for goldenrulecomics on the Squidoo website.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I do not want to give anything away.  I agree with the reviewer who said this deserves more than a 5. And I agree with Chris, who lent me this story- POWERFUL!  This will stay with you long after the last page is read.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|With what, almost 800 reviews of \\"The Big Lebowski,\\" who needs another one? Well, I watched \\"The Big Lebowski\\" for the first time since its original theatrical release last night, and wanted to write one whether it's needed or not.     Why do I say \\"The Big Lebowski\\" is \\"awe-inspiring\\"? It is awe-inspiring because it has actually inspired a religion called \\"Dudeism\\" that claims to have ordained over 50,000 ministers via its web site. I studied comparative religion in high school and took theology in college. As religions go, Dudeism goes down well, like a nice White Russian. Also, \\"The Big Lebowski\\" has an awe-inspiringly dressed and coiffed character played by John Turturro called \\"The Jesus.\\" This is pronounced \\"gee-zus\\" not \\"hay-zeus.\\" It's been suggested that \\"The Jesus\\" have his own movie, but I don't think that's a good idea. A little of \\"The Jesus\\" goes a long way.    I have to say that on first viewing I was kind of lost.  I thought \\"The Big Lebowski\\" fell far below the incredibly high bar the Coen Brothers set in their previous release, \\"Fargo,\\" which I am still upset did not win the Best Picture Academy Award in 1996. \\"The English Patient\\" was beautiful, well-done, serious, ponderous, and a period piece . . . in short total Oscar bait . . . but who wants to watch \\"The English Patient\\" over and over again? There's no wood-chipper in \\"The English Patient.\\" The subject of circumcision does not come up in \\"The English Patient.\\" In fact, unless \\"Juliette Binoche is really pretty\\" counts, I can't think of a single memorable thing about \\"The English Patient,\\" and I didn't need to see \\"The English Patient\\" to know that Juliette Binoche is really pretty. If you saw \\"Fargo,\\" you've never forgotten it, and if you love it, you  love it a lot. But Oscar hates a comedy, no matter how brilliant, and anyway, I digress . . .     So, as I said, on first viewing, \\"The Big Lebowski\\" did not strike me as up to Coen Brothers' standards. Just a lot of swearing and little bits ofweirdness and bad taste strung together in a plot that was beside the point. I walked out of the theater feeling disappointed and indifferent.     Well, all I can say is I'm older and wiser and a whole lot happier now, and \\"The Big Lebowski\\" is as perversely charming and funny a film as I can imagine. You can find details in other reviews about the amazing performances, large and small, the endlessly quotable dialogue, the lovingly drawn characters, and the wonderful pastiche of Raymond Chandler LA noir, Busby Berkeley dance sequence, and humor that satirizes almost everything from feminism to philanthropy to Gulf War I to bowling. There's even a little tribute to Charles Laughton's only film as a director, \\"The Night of the Hunter.\\" The Best Picture nominees in 1998 were two Elizabethan costume dramas and three movies about World War II. I can't remember anything about them. \\"The Big Lebowski\\" was, of course, not nominated for anything. Sometimes justice prevails if you abide long enough.      A comedy classic from the American cinema's achievers. Check it out.     (Note: This review is for the movie. I don't know one DVD \\"special edition\\" from another but I respect the frustrations expressed by serious collectors.)
B00003CXB4|5.0|I love this movie. I forgot just how much until I recently purchased it for my daughter...on my way to aquiring all the great disney movies.  We watched it together and it was so great that I have watched it several times since!!!  Although some of the scenes may be a bit much for a young one most of the scenes are cute and give great lessons.    All the actors did such a great job that the movie really does move you....you just get sucked in.  The animation is beautiful and the colors are vibrant.  The music is inspirational!  I would recommend this movie to anyone...young and old.  I loved the new scene \\"The Morning Report\\" and the second disc with all the history and information. It is well worth the cost to have this great classic.     Now I can't wait to see the lion king 2....which I didn't even know existed....gees where have I been?  It's a good thing I had my daughter to introduce me to the world of animation again....I love it!  You will too..buy it!
B000JWCJ4E|5.0|Writer/director of DOGVILLE, Lars Van Trier got his inspiration from Bertolt Brecht's \\"Pirate Jenny or Dreams of a Kitchenmaid.\\" He also created Danish soap opera [[ASIN:B000AYYV74 THE KINGDOM]] (1994), a show that was adapted by Stephen King (and others) into the 13-part TV series, [[ASIN:B00000F3SB KINGDOM HOSPITAL]] (2004).<br /><br />With a Depression-era town represented only by white line drawings on the floor and a decidely off-off Broadway feel, \\"Dogville\\" still is a very effective movie.<br /><br />Here, Nicole Kidman is a fugitive running from a mob boss who takes refuge in the bleak mountain village of Dogville. The townspeople are willing to grant her asylum in exchange for manual labor. Each resident requires specific work of Kidman. Their demands and abuses increase daily, which leads to a most unexpected ending.<br /><br />Recommended, despite the presence of a certain LB (who shall remain nameless).<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(8.0) Dogville (2003) - Nicole Kidman/James Caan/Lauren Bacall/Patricia Clarkson/Ben Gazzara/Philip Baker Hall/Zeljko Ivanek/John Hurt (narrator)
B0040IAZVM|5.0|I bought this to hear the highly rated Beethoven violin and piano sonatas with Arthur Grimiaux, but there is sooo much more.  I am thrilled to have finally discovered Clara Haskil.  What an exquisite touch, such articulation, absolutely wonderful emotional shading - on every note!  What a thrilling pianist!  And then I read the biographic notes and was particularly moved - she really must have had the muse to come through all of that.  And her muse is what can easily be heard - just outstanding!      Think I'm gushing?  On Wikipedia you can read the very highest tribute - by Charlie Chaplin, a friend of hers, who said that she was one of three geniuses he had met - the other two being \\"Professor Einstein and Winston Churchill\\".  I've only just started listening, and the music is simply gorgeous.  I know that the goose bumps have only just begun. Happy Listening!
B0021L8V0M|2.0|I ordered the Salt unrated version with the 2 unrated extended cuts, what I erceived was the theatrical release only, with a few interviews thrown in.  The 2 extended cuts were not there.  I bought this version specifically because I wanted to see the extended version.  I am not pleased with this particular delivery.
B001DHXT6G|3.0|most of the films work perfectly but there are a few discs on the first season that do not work at all, ive tried on several different dvd players and still nothing, it just says there is a disc error, my friend who has the season, he bought it at frys, and all of the discs work on my dvd player but for some reason these ones dont
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|In \\"X-Men,\\" we were introduced to a man known only as Logan, aka The Wolverine. Now, the story behind Wolverine is revealed...<br /><br />Hugh Jackman stars in the explosive, action-packed prequel to \\"X-MEN.\\" Liev Schreiber joins the cast as Victor Creed, Logan's brother with a dark secret. And the fun is just beginning...To say any more would spoil the pleasure. Ryan Reynolds co-stars as Wade Wilson (shame his screen time was so short). Danny Huston (the HBO miniseries \\"John Adams\\") also stars as William Stryker, a mysterious figure with ulterior motives. The movie is fun from hair-raising beginning to the exciting bitter end. Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.

B000J5XS3C|5.0|I've been podcasting for 18 months and have always used a USB mic directly into my PC. My boss decided to start a podcast to market his business and we needed a mixing board with 2 mics; something I've never done before. This board was easy to hook up and simple to play around with. We're using two Shure P48 microphones and Audacity to record. I had everything out of the box and hooked up in a few minutes, and we were making adjustments to the audio and recording in no time.    A year ago I bought an MXL990 USB mic for $100.00, and the set up I just described cost less but sounds twice as good. I'm going to buy this mixing board and mics and start podcasting from home with this setup as well.
B002ZG999U|4.0|Full of action galore.It's not going to win any Oscars or any awards,but you knew that going in.Led by Sly Stallone with a bunch of past and present action stars.Pretty much Stallone,Jet LI and Jason Statham carry the movie along with such other greats in a lesser role. Bruce Willis,Eric Roberts,Mickey Rourke,Arnold S with even a 2 minute or so appearance,Dolph Lundgren,among others are there to for support.A fun movie that will have your heart racing,with some nasty bodies exploding and guts pouring.Not too graphic as his most recent Rambo,but lots of fun.So if you are into Stallone and his action style,you should enjoy this one highly.It is around 1 hr. and 35 minutes.Just the right time for this type of film.Expect a second installment of Expendables to start shooting in June.I'm sure it will be just as intense.So what are you waiting for??? Grab a seat,some popcorn and sit back for action-packed fun.
B004132HZS|5.0|produced as only BBC can do it. Full of wit and decductions, with logical character devlopments.   Steven Moffat's writting brings sherlock holmes straight into the 21st century, while keeping true to the spirit of the stories created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  Cumberbatch and Freeman bring their characters to life marvelously.    I love it.  can't wait for season 2!  (thank you moffat and gatiss!)
B0016PM722|4.0|Everything is wonderful about this product except three small things. (So please take what I am about to write with a grain of salt.) The very tip of the lightsaber does not light up. It still looks cool in the dark and on camera but it doesn't look as cool in regular light. Also, the stand it comes with does not allow the \\"Star Wars\\" name to show if it was mounted. The stand is better suited to put on a long shelf.    Finally, this is not the FX saber you can unscrew the saber part from. If you are looking for that saber look somewhere else.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I was amazed as a kid watching the first SW at the theater. Watching them again as adults always takes us back to our youth. We thought the SW universe was the coolest thing and we still do. So while many complain about the edited versions, we take what we can get. We have the original trilogy special edition DVD box set, which we rarely watch because we usually end up watching them on TV. Go figure. Spike plays them all just about every weekend in HD. Of the new trilogy we have the last two but we are missing Phantom Menace, we have that on VHS for some reason and no longer have a VHS. So we will be buying the bluray set. I do agree that there should be an unaltered version of the original films because I truly despise the OLD Obi-wan standing next to the NEW Anakin ending. We also enjoy watching the 2nd trilogy. OK so we FF most of the Hayden Christensen scenes except the part where he's melting, \\"NOOOOOO\\". Point is we still watch & enjoy the movies despite the edits and can't wait to see how they look on bluray. Please put the old Anakin back though in the end of ROTJ. I also enjoy the Ewok ending in that film but understand the intent with the new ending, how it ties the films together. It would still be fair to the fans to release the unaltered versions, so viewers can choose which version to play.
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|I have received the 60 CD box set a few days ago and, frankly speaking, was longing for it ... I am not deceived. Wonderful cover in the style of LP set of yesteryears and many photographies of Lenny, absolutely beautiful from the beginning to his end ! And after, \\"the song is ended but the melody lingers on...\\". The first complete Mahler cycle is included, also the Beethoven, Brahms, Nielsen, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, and many more, including the maestro's own symphonies and a few american (and, sometimes, somewhat exotic) symphonies. Surely, with my complete symphonic and operatic cycles by Karajan and this one by Lenny, I am the happiest melomane in the world !   Now we can wait for a concerto edition, maybe also an opera edition. Why not ?
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Great DVD series!!  Bought for my parents for Christmas and they loved it!!  Said it was their favorite gift they've received yet!!
193413712X|1.0|Not my cup of tea, I guess. Didn't care about the characters. Went off on wordy tangents that were unnecessary. This would have been ok as a short well edited story. How it won a prize, I can't figure.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|As a 30+ year Springsteen fan, I have eagerly awaited the release of \\"The Promise.\\"  And, I am very, very pleased with this beautifully produced set.  The remastered CD of \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\" retains the raw power of the original while adding clarity and separation of instruments and voices unheard in the original.  The newly released songs that were recorded but not included in the album are terrific.  I especially love \\"The Promise\\" - a song of remarkable depth and breadth, and the equal of many of Bruce's early masterpieces.  The early studio and concert outtakes capture the energy and intensity of a young Springsteen, and bring back fond memories of his 1978 tour. And finally, Bruce and the original (minus the deceased Danny Federici on organ) E Street Band's live video of the entire album recorded in 2009 showcases their continued vocal and instrumental mastery of the music that is as relevant and original today as it was when it was released in 1978.  A must have for Springsteen fans, and a great \\"starter\\" kit for those who have not previously experienced his artistic and performance brilliance.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|the book was awesome, loved every word. i think it's great that not all is revealed, i hope that was truly done on purpose and there is more to come. her writing talent is phenominal. what a great story! i recommend reading highlander series first if you have not yet started the fever series. not only are they also great books, but i think they help shape the world of the fever series and give a lot of information. sorta of wish i had never read any of it and i could read it all over again for the first time, but also just as happy to know how the story ends now...guess thats my duality or bipolar peeking out! ;) read the books, it's very doubtful you will be dissapointed.
0374290024|1.0|This book is a waste of time and money.  Ian Morris talks a lot but has little to say.  Though he does give a lot of information, very little pertains to the subject at hand. You have to sift through mounds of words in order to find a couple of sentences that answer the question as to \\"Why the West rules\\". It's tiresome, and it's dishonest.  Had he called his book: \\"A History of the World\\", it would have been fine and extremely informative indeed.  But it wouldn't sell as well,now, would it?
1400052173|5.0|I don't read much non-fiction and when I do it is not usually science.  That said, I found this book to be interesting and well-told.  The writing was accessible.  From beginning to end, I was engaged in the intertwined stories of the people Ms. Skloot is writing about.  Some reviews criticize it for too much science and others for not enough.  I thought the balance was just right.  I also really liked her empathy for the family-members and her patience.  Some criticize Ms. Skloot for injecting herself into the narrative but I think she became a necessary part of the unwinding of the story.  I hope that this book and the process of being involved with it has brought some healing to the family and perhaps a clearer understanding of what happened.   I learned a great deal about the history of medical science from this tale.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I am a 26, and have read all the Percy Jackson books. Rick Riordan does not write down in his young adult books, as some authors have a tendency to do. I started reading these books because I love Greek Mythology, but  kept reading them because of the wonderfully engaging storylines.   I was nervous about this new series, because I  hate it when an author does a spin off, and totally ignores previous characters who would and should be in the mix. Riordan perfectly intergrates his new characters in with the old.   My only tiny complaint is with Jasons past. I think who he is would have had more of an impact on one character in the previous books. He would have been brought up or killed, just because of who he is.  Happy Reading!
1400052173|5.0|Well written, real, educating, interesting.  I was sorry it ended.  Very very good book.  And you are learning a lot while reading a good book.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have tried many other videos and could not stick with any of them for more than a week. They were too boring. I bought this video with little hope. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and still love it! Level 1 was a little too easy for me. I didn't sweat enough after 3 days so I went to Level 2. Now I do Level 3 with a Level 2 or 1 added in just for the extra abuse.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Added muscle<br />Toned<br />Jillian's inspirational<br />Short circuits<br />Exercises<br />Music<br />Easy to do moves<br />3 Different levels<br />Easy or difficult moves<br /><br />Cons:<br />Jillian (see below)<br />No weight lose in 3 weeks (that is because I added muscle so not really a con)<br /><br />Jillian does get a little annoying when you are exercising so hard you feel like you are dying and you hear Jillian say \\"Just 5 more\\" and your muscles are screaming in pain and you feel like dropping to the floor and not moving for the rest of the day. But that is the reason you get results. Jillian pushes you (if you let her) to the extent of making changes to your body. If you do the exercises and watch what you eat you will lose the weight. I don't know if it's possible to lose 20 lbs in 30 days but if you stuck with it for a couple of months and really applied yourself you could easily lose the weight and get in shape.<br /><br />I can see myself using this video and [[ASIN:B001NFNFN0 Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism]]for many years to come without getting bored.<br /><br />I love this video and highly recommend this it to those that are ready to get in shape.
0385341679|3.0|I have been waiting for this book for years..... Loved the Highlander series and when I started the Fever series I was absorbed into the story.  However, after all the buildup for the last book, I feel let down.  I was expecting a huge epic ending from what was said by the author and ones that had read it prior to release.  However, it was lukewarm at best.  Don't get me wrong it was a nice ending, just not compared to the buildup from the last 4 books.
0385341679|5.0|I don't know how to review this book without spoiling it, and trust me, you don't want to be spoiled. This book was fantastic, had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.     Shadowfever is the longest of all fever novels, with at least 220 plus pages, which means a lot more story. There is so much I want to say about this book.    First I'll say, FINALLY! Answers to all question. This novel is like a whirlwind. It just keeps spinning and spinning. Because it's the last novel of the series, you know that you'll get answers for all the questions you have. What you don't realize when you first open the book is how many more questions you'll ask.Moning saved  every answer for the end. Which drove me insane. When you finally think, \\"Ah! An answer,\\" you soon realize it's not an answer at all. So you keep on going until finally everything is out.     The focus of this novel was not only to stop the Book, but also for Mac to discover who she really is. Mac's journey is full of pain, betrayal, loneliness, and heartache, but she survives because of a cold place, a few side-kicks, and a dream to erase it all.     I don't know whether to be happy or sad that the series is over. But read it.    The only problem I had was how there were so many different questions that would come up. First there was question A, then B, C, and D. By time you realize you never got an answer for any of them, you're already on question S, 200 pages later. Eventually everything was answered, but it was overwhelming with the number of things to focus on.

030746363X|4.0|I have had to read this book in different sections a few times...just to make sure I am doing it right. I have been doing this diet since Jan 3rd. I dont know if I have lost weight yet..but will tell you it is very difficult to eat 30-60 minutes after I wake up... also eating beans for breakfast? not so easy. Have just eaten protein for breakfast. I DO love Tim Ferriss's approach to everything. He is a crazy, scientific man, try anything kind of guy, and I like that. I have had lots of problems \\"moving\\" what I am eating on this diet, I think due to high protein content...Hopefully, with the probiotoc I bought, things will eventually regualte. Its a fun book with lots of radical ideas, that just might work!! will keep you posted on progress. It' s a pretty easy diet, and the cheat day helps you not to ever feel deprived. This diet is a full time job, as I think it was written more for bachelors than for moms...but trying to keep up and will hopefully see results..
B000YDE46Y|5.0|these boots are unreal. i bought for the soul purpose of the way they look. i have work boots and snow boots but not really a pair to wear out for the night. these look unreal with a pair of jeans and a nice shirt. all my friends want a pair now because i have them. they are so light on the foot you almost forget your wearing boots. they are very comfortable and i'm addicted to them. i almost bought a pair for these upwards of 200$ at macy's right before christmas then i found them on here for much cheaper. i've had these boots for about half a year now and i have no complaints. all around excellent purchase.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I bought this was as my introduction into automatic watches.  It is very accurate at -3.5s/day.  The only negative is the crystal is easily scratched because it sits above the case.  The clear back is a great way to show your friends that aren't familiar with mechanical watch what is inside an automatic and how it all works.<br /><br />Keep this in mind before you buy something you aren't informed about, and leave a poor review:<br />-An automatic isn't as accurate as a quartz<br />-it requires movement to continue working,<br />-if you don't know what 36mm looks like, check a ruler.<br /><br />This watch was an incredible value when I bought it (around $80) and a great way to see if you truly are a fan of mechanical watches or whether it was just a novelty.  You aren't risking a months pay to find out.  This watch wound up being a tad small for  me so I replaced it with a Seiko 5 sports model (40+mm) and passed this on to my gf who loves it.  She was hesitant to go this big before... now she wants a new auto maybe even a little larger.  Seiko is by far the best value when it comes to automatic watches, you won't be disappointed.
1577314808|2.0|In the preface of this book, Eckhart Tolle states that its critics label it meaningless 'mumbo jumbo'.  On the contrary, I find that it makes a lot of sense.  Meaninglessness is not the flaw I found in it.  It was just very repetitive.  Although it has ten chapters, the topics were indistinct to me, all running together as rephrasings of the same idea.  About halfway through, I felt that Eckhart Tolle had already delivered all he had to offer as a writer of spiritual teachings, and I became tired of reading the book.  I don't deny the truth in his message, but I didn't find it to be transmitted in a captivating way in this book.  It felt like a watered-down summary of many other great books.      If this were a person's first venture into the idea of consciousness and present moment awareness, I believe the repetition would help to clarify the concept.  But if you've read similar books, then the lack of depth may leave you bored.      I also found the writer to be short of humility in the way that he uses the preface solely to hype the wonders of his own book and to rebut any possible criticism against it.
1594202842|5.0|The story....from the very first page:   \\"This is a story about a mother, two daughters, and two dogs.  It is also about Mozart and Mendelssohn, the piano and the violin, and how we made it to Carnegie Hall.  This was supposed to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones.  But instead, it's about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of glory, and how I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old.\\"  And a truly wonderful story it is.  Thank you Amy Chua for sharing.
0307474712|5.0|One of the great pleasures as a reader is to come across a new author who really surprises you with being wonderful, and I liken this discover to opening a new gift on Christmas that was unexpected but wonderful. This is how I felt after reading this book One Day by David Nichols. He approached the age-old tale of two people who meet and click but the timing is not right for them to successfully unite as a couple,but who may over time if life allows the timing to ever be right for them as a couple.<br /><br />This book tells the tale of Emma and Dex who meet in college and become friends over the years despite drifting apart and fighting from time to time. The joy of reading about this couple is that you see both perspectives as the years troll by, and know deep down they are meant for one another. So, the suspense is there even though there is some predictability to the story. I enjoyed that suspense, and following the two well written characters through their early adult lives and into their middle adult lives.<br /><br />The book has an odd ending, though not unbelievable, I feel was not absolutely necessary. Some will like the end and some will loath the end, and I fell in between. Some predictability issues and the odd ending aside, this is a wonderfully written tale of two young people finding themselves and growing up and in love. I also enjoyed the references to the different locales in the book as I am always interested in other countries and cultures.<br /><br />I highly recommend this literary fiction novel to anyone interested in a wonderful story about life and love, and all that happens with both.
B00280LYHS|5.0|this book completely BLEW ME AWAY!!!  It has everything: romance, action, suspense.  I love how Percy and Annabeth fall in love at the end.  You can really tell that the characters have matured a lot and it makes me want to start at the beginning all over again.  So basically I LOVED the book and I think it was the best book in the series BY FAR!!! I am really going to miss this series a lot!!!!!!!
B001VNB54A|5.0|I was 18 years old when Pearl Harbor was attacted and consequently lived through all of the years embedded in this excellent DVD about the war years in the Pacific. I thought the acting was terrific and the storyline authentic.
B001AR0D4A|4.0|Good monster movie about a group of strangers being trapped in a supermarket after a scientific accident plunges another dimension into ours with creatures roaming the mist. Good performances from Thomas Jane and Toby Jones push this King entry well above the norm and some scenes are very intense.  Well worth adding to your monster movie collection, put it on your must buy list, you won't be sorry.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|My first advice to potential readers is to make sure you read the first four books before you read this final installment. This series (in my opinion) is not a stand alone series. Each book needs to be read in order. Also, be careful reading reviews! You don't want to read any spoilers to ruin the experience.     WOAH! This book....... AMAZING! I'm not going to tell you what it was about, or go into details on anything because it needs to be experienced through the book alone. I will tell you, I was wowed, fascinated, floored, shocked, saddened, angry, and every other emotion you can think of while reading Shadowfever. I would give it 10 stars if I could. There was only one thing that didn't happen in this book that I was positive was going to happen and didn't... but nevertheless, Karen Moning nailed it. This is going to remain one of my favorite series for life. I'm still reeling!  Thank you, Karen!!!!!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|great movie, great price, no problems with the transaction with amazon, definately better than buying it in the store for 19.99
0545265355|4.0|The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins is the captivating saga of Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen year old girl living in a futuristic society ruled by a tyrannical president. Her journey begins when she volunteers to take her beloved sister's place in a barbaric ritual called the Hunger Games. Written in the first person, the reader cannot help but be sucked into Katniss' world of strife, where every wrong decision weighs against her odds of survival. The macabre and grisly details become more vivid with each installment until the many twists of the story are often uncomfortable to read. By the third book I no longer found the story enjoyable. My motivation to continue reading was driven by my own need for a resolution to all the events that had drawn me in, the events were so awful. The epilogue attempted to offer a happy ending, but Ms. Collins must have felt some burden to keep the outcome realistic. As a result, the epilogue does not, in my opinion, begin to balance the grimness of all that has transpired as I shared Katniss' life story.     The boxset itself was a great value. I purchased it for my sixth grader, who had read the first book and thirsted to read more. I enjoyed discussing elements of each book at length with him. This series is perfect for both young adults and adults to read as it has so much scope to offer.
0756659841|3.0|Lots of stickers, but they do not stick that well if you are trying to stick them on something other than the pages in the book.  My son likes to have stickers on his folders and they keep peeling off.  Drives me nuts, finding stickers all over the house.
1593272790|5.0|Good inspiration book. Pictures from multiple views to see how it is built.     Could benefit from a part list.
0547260695|2.0|The pop-ups are wonderful but I sincerely dislike the new translation.  If you fell in love with The Little Prince as translated by Katherine Woods, think twice about buying this.  It is, after all, the story that we truly love.
0312370849|3.0|The book [[ASIN:0814726623 French Children of the Holocaust: A Memorial]] by Serge Klarsfeld, published by NYU Press, will show you the photos, names, ages, address and deportation information of the more than 11,000 French children who were killed in concentration camps. It is unbelievable and yet real - we need to remember what we as humans are capable of to not let this happen again.  I commend the author for her willingness to take on this difficult topic. Unfortunately, I found her prose too simple and her story's framework - broken marriage, the \\"coincidence\\" of linking her family story with the Jewish girl - too easy and not doing justice to the haunting experience of persecution and death camps.   I would strongly recommend other fiction, like [[ASIN:0679776591 Fugitive Pieces: A Novel]] by Ann Michaels (some narrative weakness, but amazing language), [[ASIN:0439880009 I Am a Star]] by Inge Auerbacher, \\"Fateless\\" by Imre Kertesz or survivors' memoirs (Wiesel, Buergenthal, Eisenstein, Levi and others) or Art Spiegelman's [[ASIN:B002YCJ814 Maus I and Maus II]].
B002ZG981E|5.0|The best movie I have seen since \\"The Dark Knight.\\" Original plot, Extremely tense action, and great actors make this an awesome movie worth watching again and again.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|the lost hero is an awsome book i wish i could stay up all night long reading it.it is great book for both kids and adults its about this guy who just appears at this school and he doesnt have a clue who he is.it also talks about the new great prophocy its the best book ever
B001GQSY64|5.0|First off this movie is just down right awesome. I got the blu ray version and the picture and sound is great. There's also some nice special features too. When I first heard of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, I was afraid that they were gonna ruin the best sci-fi movie ever made by turning it into a cartoon, I'm glad I was wrong. In my opinion it's way better than episodes 1&2 combined, even though they weren't really as great as 3-6. I never saw it in theaters, I just caught an episode of the series on Cartoon Network, so I decided to give it a shot, not to mention that the blu ray was like $5. I've already ordered season 1 on blu ray and plan on getting season 2. There's plenty of action and humor. The battle droids had me cracking up. Adults will love this as much as the kids, I'm in my 20's and I love it. I was suprised to see that Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, and Anthony Daniels(the only one qualified to do C-3PO) in the voice cast. If you have the choice, get blu ray. I'm not sure how the dvd quality is, but for the price I got, there's not a big difference. Just get it. May the force be with you.
0984074422|5.0|This book is a prime example of how faithful journalism becomes art. By simply documenting people's relationship to food, Menzel and D'Aluisio reveal a rich and fascinating view of humanity. Their combination of simple facts set against lush yet honest photographs is just perfect. It's a beautiful and thought-provoking work that I am proud to have on my shelf.
B00003CXC6|5.0|The film Rashomon is a pure classic. The acting and plot twists make this a truly enjoyable movie to watch for everyone from film students to casual viewers. When you start watching the classics, you start to realize that modern film is built off of classic film like this. Truly, Akira Kurosawa's much revered movie has become a model off which countless other movies have been made. Overall, the film is enjoyable to watch, and the storytelling is superb, especially when taken in perspective with modern film. The structure of the story is one which has been copied in many movies, even those which are quite famous.<br /><br />What makes Rashomon notable, besides the fact that it was made in 1950 in Japan, well before the modern convention was used in most films, is that is uses a non-linear approach to the tale. Instead of having a static protagonist and setting, the same story is told from many points of view. In Rashomon, there are four main perspectives from which the same story is told. The event which the story revolves around is a rape and murder. However, just as in real life, the truth about what really happened is not as clear as we would like.<br /><br />The movie is full of action which keeps most viewers entertained, but it is also home to a stunning story of truth, justice, and consequences. The director, Kurosawa, focuses on the difficulty in knowing what human nature is really like, as it goes through the different perspectives of the characters in the story. The picture is better because background information about the film indicates that the director's favorite actor, Toshiro Mifune, plays the lead role. This unity is obvious throughout the film which is a work of art.

1594202842|5.0|Anyone who wants to criticize Amy Chua REALLY needs to read this whole book first. Believe me, its not hard. I got through in two days, it was hard to put down.     This book is definitely not any kind of proper critique of Western parenting, in fact Amy Chua doesn't seem to know very much about how Westerners actually parent their children, probably because of her self imposed isolation. As someone very much raised by Western parents, I can say that many of the scenes in the book could have been from my very own childhood. She didn't seem aware that her methods are actually fairly common in upper class and upper middle class homes, though without the singular focus on one activity and the social isolation. The book also doesn't contain a single fact or statistic to back up any of the assertions she makes.     That isn't the point though. Its about real family relationships, about judging others, about finding humility, and about the power and resilience of children. The last point, the strength of children, is in my opinion the most powerful message the book brings. The one point she makes throughout the book that is dead on is that Western culture assumes weakness in children where her parenting style assumes strength. I think the response to her book really establishes that. Those shocked by her piece in the Wall Street Journal will say that she abused her children, crushed them, crippled them emotionally. That's a very typical reaction in our culture, to accuse others of damaging their children. Amy Chua's point is that children are resilient and indomitable, which is actually quite a beautiful message.    Chua also has a sense of humor that is very subtle and self mocking, and a lot of readers will fail to pick up on it. I found the book very funny in many places though. Her daughter Lulu is hilarious. I would encourage people to read this book with an open mind and a lot of grace for Chua because she is really putting herself out there and if you make it through the book you'll see the ending contains a whole lot of humility and growth.

B0042MEQVG|4.0|I thought it was a great deal for $8 especially since Eclipse just came out not too long ago.  The only downside is that because it's a single disc, there is no special feature disc.  But I bought it just for the movie so it's good enough for me.
B002GYS1FO|2.0|Loved the cover art.  I thought the band had a great look.  I had really high expectations from hearing the Kia ad song, but that was the only great song.  The rest of the album was 2 points better than \\"it sucked\\".
0307266303|5.0|regardless of whether or not you enjoy running this book is a must-buy  i bought several when it first came out in hardcover for all my running friends and family members and then had to repurcahse my own copy after my boyfriend took mine on a long-term lease    it's an enjoyable and informative read that you'll pick up over and over again  it will not get old

1594202842|5.0|I purchased this on Sunday and finished it by Tuesday. I couldn't put it down. I've read a few reviews here on Amazon and I saw a bit of the 60 Minutes piece about this book;I have to say that I am surprised at the apparent indignation that this book has caused. To me this seems like a book written from one person's perspective. It is obviously not a parenting manual. It is not a critique of either Western or Chinese parenting. It is the story of a second generation, Chinese American mother and her parenting strategies and family dynamics.   I value it for two reasons. First, it can be so helpful to see one's own culture through a fresh lens. I very much enjoyed the author's perspective on some of the \\"givens\\" that Americans seem to automatically adopt. I think taking a second look at the motivation behind parenting strategies is guaranteed to be entertaining and (as in my own case) might even provoke some soul searching. I believe that mothering is the most important job I will ever have- any insights that either reinforce my outlook or help me see things in a new way can only lead me to more solid ground. New perspective isn't threatening unless you are afraid to think.  Secondly, the author's absolutely candid account was so refreshing! Reading this book was like peaking in someone's window... not in the reality TV kind of way with absurd posturing, but like a good friend openly sharing her successes and struggles. And actually, this is the most surprising part! So much of what seemed to motivate the author's parenting style was pride. She drew so much of her sense of worth from the praise of those around her. Practicing the violin with Lulu was exhausting, horrible, ridiculous,etc. but it was \\"all worth it\\" when the instructor praised her for her progress. What a long way Chua must have come to decide to delve into, analyze, and then reveal her mothering journey- even with its blemishes. That's the beauty of this book. It openly and honestly chronicles one woman's effort to parent to the very best of her ability. The conclusion she (and the reader along with her) reaches, is that though there might be a formula for success in many things we do , there is no one right way to parent.
0385341679|5.0|I have been on pins & needles waiting for this finale to the Fever Series and it as WELL worth the WAIT!!  It was so full of cliff-hangars and unexpected turns that I couldn't put the book down.  I read the entire thing in one day and was spellbound through out.  Ms. Moning's story line was well-thought out and so full of detail that I had trouble remembering that the Fever world is fictional.  I would recommend this book to EVERYONE that loves a good supspense thriller with hot shots of steamy sexual tension and imaginative characters-- both \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" alike!
B0049VQZUA|5.0|I watched the free 5 minute sketch and it cought my attention. I bought the first episode at work thinking \\"Ah, it's only 2 bucks. What have I got to loose.\\" Well now that I've watched it, I am hooked! This isn't your \\"average TV show\\". It's like watching a movie the whole time. I'm shocked it wasn't on the \\"big screen\\". They could have made a killing on the box office. I will definitely watch every episode to come. ... But I checked online and they're playing the first season on AMC tonight. I called the girlfriend at the house and had her set the DVR. :~D
0780021967|5.0|It's impressive how this movie hasn't aged at all. Sound in film had been around for just 8 years when this came out, close to a hundred years ago.    In the film, the hero is hunted down by both the bad guys and the police at the same time. Although he can trust no-one except himself, he keeps his manners and sense of humor. The movie is very modern in its politics, such as an innkeeper scolded for not giving a runaway couple their privacy, or a lonely farmer's wife's dreams of the big city.    It's funny too, with music-hall humor, over-sped up chase scenes, a gratuitous autogyro shot, and puns like changing a Scottish place name to \\"Killin\\".

B003YD00RS|5.0|That's what I have written on my blog <[...]  I received a company car to perform my duties around a remote site. I received also a checklist that I am supposed to fill-up every day. No big deal, I thought but when I received the document. I realized that it was a A4 sheet cramped with little boxes. It covers items from tires, brake fluid, radiator cap etc. I still have to determine how long it would take each morning to finish it.    It will be an excellent opportunity to discuss what are the purpose and the design of a check-list with my team. Checklist are  good exercises of Einstein's say that we \\"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.\\"    Gwande has written a wonderful book on checklists (The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right, Metropolitan Books, 2009). He goes through a quest about the relevance of checklists on several areas and the importance of a good and thoughtful design.    Checklists are a powerful tool, properly applied they can perform wonders, save lives, spare resources. The opposite can be, at a minimum, a waste of time and effort.
B003AWRMCE|1.0|i dislike my order on count when i got it there was nothing on the dvd it would not play..and i am very un happy...
B003UESJH4|5.0|Update: I am happy to report that Colin Firth was not robbed of his Oscar.  For those of us who have been following him since he played Darcy in the '90s, we all could not be more pleased for him.<br /><br />There is really something terribly wrong with the Oscars if Firth doesn't win this time.  I cannot imagine another actor surpassing this performance.  He covers every variable of King George VI's character and emotions as he struggles with becoming King despite a horrendous stammering problem.  The rigid strictures of his childhood as relayed to his therapist indeed make the problem not all that surprising.  We discover another bad trait to his abdicating brother David's character (as if we needed another one) in that he ridiculed Bertie's stuttering and stammering to his face from early childhood forward.<br /><br />This is not the only superlative performance, however.  Helena Bonham Carter as his wife and Queen is also outstanding in every scene.  It is quite a love story between these two as well, certainly something else quite unusual in the House of Windsor. It is amazing that such a faithful and in love couple could be followed by so many grandchildren who had such trouble finding the same.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush is also quite wonderful as the speech therapist and he too shines every time he is on camera.  He and Firth are particularly marvelous together.<br /><br />Even if you do not like royal stories in general, this so transcends the usual royal story in every respect that it is hard to imagine anyone not being won over to this wonderful film.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0034G4P7G|4.0|I am a HUGE Fincher Film. So I was very excited to see this film when it came out in the theaters. I loved it. So of coarse I bought it to add to my Fincher DVD collection. The packaging is awesome, makes you feel like you have a special gem. But the extras on Disc 2 are boring. Showing how Fincher does 99 takes for each shot! Oh I love the finished result but it makes me feel  bad for the cast and crew. 99 takes! Usually special features adds to the movie but for me the extras took away a little of the joy of watching the film. Just buy the movie..you'll be happy.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I'm finding that the workouts on this DVD are excellent and do really help you lose weight.  My biggest complaint is in how the DVD was mastered.  This is a DVD that is designed to be played every single day, yet has an unskippable intro which takes a couple minutes to get from starting to play DVD to actually starting the workout.
0385341679|5.0|Once again Karen has outdone herself. This book is amazing!!! Just to look at the beautiful cover on the book itself takes my breath away. Also this is a long novel not some 350 page job. All my questions were answered. I can hardly wait to see who Karen writes about next. I have read all her Fever books and her Highlander books. It was so good to see the McKeltar family all featured in this book. As much as I loved Mac and Barrons, it was really cute to read about Cian's tatoo of Jessie's name.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This is a different type of werewolf story. Even though Grace, the main character, is mauled by werewolves in the beginning page the wolves aren't actually that violent usually. One wolf, who we later find out is Sam, stops the attack and Grace lives. He waits for six years, watching her, but she never turns into a werewolf. The rest of the story is about Grace and Sam, trying to reconcile their different worlds.    The werewolves in the story only turn human in the summer and turn back once it gets too cold. It's a unique take on the idea of werewolves turning because of the moon, instead the author states that it's cold that causes the change to occur. The whole story is a sweet romance with a little paranormal element. It is a quick read and I highly recommend it.
B003KZZ4TO|5.0|This is a great album. I already had it on CD but loved the idea of owning it on vinyl. Well worth it.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I have yet to purchase a true surround sound system for my living room and used my television's built in speakers for game audio. Let me tell you I was blown away by the difference. Suddenly I could hear the footsteps as my enemies trying to sneak up on me, I was truly immersed in my games! I was actually surprised to find out that the headset does not use discrete speakers for the different channels but instead takes advantage of the way our mind PERCEIVES directional sound. As a result, the headphones have larger speakers and can produce better audio fidelity than smaller speakers would be able to. Being wireless is a huge perk because I don't have to worry about kids tripping over cables. And of course I can have a late night gaming session without disturbing the Missus or the neighbors.<br /><br />If you're looking for a set of surround sound headsets, look no further. I'd HIGHLY recommend them to anyone.
B002ZG98C8|1.0|Let me first say I have met Robert Rodriguez in Austin,Tx on more than one occasion. I loved Desperado for what it was. Machete is pure garbage plain and simple. Jessica Alba actually looked frightened when she had to kiss Danny Trejo LOL! Absolutely no logic whatsoever and whoa! TRASHY! DO NOT waste your hard earned money! Rodriguez is known for making large films on low budgets. This film must have spent all of the money on the Casting. Two very enthusiastic thumbs down :(
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|After reading some of the reviews on Amazon,I thought I buy this version,I already had the first one.I figured this would be a nice birthday present to myself(okay,forgive me you guys).MAN!,I'm glad I did.What a difference the whole three hours makes in the story of this great movie!It's like watching it for the first time,everything about this epic was more detailed and made sense when watching it with a fresh mind.That is to say,as if you hadn't seen it before.What a wonderful story is told here,I don't want to spoil this for those who have not seen it,but here it goes.From the heartbreak of Balian's wife's death and losing his faith to Sybilla's son!Geoffery fully explains his actions in coming back to France.Why Balian throws the priest into the fire and his skills as an engineer and warrior.Saladin's taking to war and marching on Jerusalem!WHAT A STORY!.In my opinion,all these added extras did not drag the movie along,but gave it clarity to the contrary.It was insightful and helped the viewer to understand the whole of the subject playing out before them.I could both see myself in this movie and was moved by the story.So much so in fact that I have memorized the Knight's creed(but that's just the romantic in me!).The whole of me wanted to be in the middle of the action!To fight alongside Balian,defend the city and the fair maidens.This movie also helps in understanding the differences between the two faiths and hopefully coming to a meeting point in the future.Then,it would truly be the Kingdom of Heaven.Good and bad actions are carried out by both sides,history declares this,and so does this movie.No one side is glorified or villianized,I for one find that refreshing(as a Christian I mean).Great action and again great story,this movie has it all!Mr.Scott,you did a wonderful job making this movie and putting this out on the director's three hour cut!When I first saw the previews to this movie,I fell in love with it even before I went to go see it!I have always wanted to be a knight with a great and noble cause to carry out.This movie helped me to realize that boyhood dream....Mr.Scott,thank you again.wanted to be a knight with a great and noble cause to carry out.This movie helped me to realize that boyhood dream....Mr.Scott,thank you again.

B001DJLCRC|4.0|For the most part, I agree with the glowing tones of most of the users, but I'll just spend this review elaborating and disagreeing.    I thought the first 5 episodes were just fantastic. Especially the way they took what you'd think would become a 1 dimensional character and filled them out. There is a character named Hank who at the beginning looks like a stupid racist cop, but in reality has a good heart and is awkward sometimes and just frankly surprises you. Many characters like that. I love the sense of, 'huh, haven't seen that before' that I get from this TV show.    However, i think it gets a bit weak right at episode 6. Maybe it's writer's strike stuff in here, but there's a bit too much badassery (visiting Tuco) and, umm, I don't know, CSI like explanations of chemistry stuff...Caused me real concern in the direction of the show, but I'm definitely going to continue on to season 2...

My sister does not watch the show - so they get into TV wars, where she must either go upstairs, or fight for the DVR - and he huffs upstairs.<br /><br />So, I bought this set, along with [[ASIN:B001FB4VXU The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Second Season]] - for BIL's Christmas Present.  He sat it right next to the living room TV, and waited for Sis to go off for work that evening - and open the package.  I enjoy the shows when I watch it with him, but between my Computer Surfing, my DVR recordings, Netflix, and my new Kindle - I don't even have time to watch On Demand, much less this show.<br /><br />However, this DVD set obviously clears up SOME room on the DVR for Sis's programs.<br /><br />Since it isn't listed on the page, the DVD Package Contents:<br /><br />Disk 1: includes the episodes \\"Pilot,\\" \\"The Big Bran Hypothesis,\\" \\"The Fuzzyboots Corollary,\\" \\"The Luminous Fish Effect,\\" \\"The Hamburger Postulate,\\" and \\"The Middle Earth Paradigm.\\"<br /><br />Disk 2: includes episodes \\"The Dumpling Paradox,\\" \\"The Grasshopper Experiment,\\" \\"The Cooper-Hofstadter Polarization,\\" \\"The Loobenfeld Decay,\\" \\"The Pancake Batter Anomaly\\" and \\"The Jerusalem Duality.\\"<br /><br />Disk 3: includes episodes \\"The Batjar Conjecture,\\" \\"The Nerdvana Annihilation,\\" \\"The Pork Chop Indeterminacy,\\" \\"The Peanut Reaction\\" and \\"The Tangerine Factor.\\"<br /><br />Bonus Feature - Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory: Series Cast and Creators on Why It's Cool to Be a Geek (featurette).<br /><br />Review of show itself - I find it one of the more intelligent offerings for Sitcoms - and again, its from CBS - whom offers Two and a Half Men.  Outside of The Office, these are the only sit coms I will really watch.  It caters to a more higher denomination for viewing pleasure, as opposed to most offerings developed to push a bad taste in the mouth.<br /><br />Our group of four nerds stand outside the social and accepted etiquette, along with lack of Pop Culture knowledge.

B002JI94J4|5.0|Some people might say that this isn't completely \\"blu-ray\\" quality, but it's an old movie, and I think it's a great picture. Hilarious movie, I am a huge Beatles fan, and I absolutely love \\"Hard Day's Night.\\"
076781326X|1.0|Just to start... i only gave this a one star to attract attention so that peole will read this cause thay can't believe a one for this movie. The one is not for the movie itself. It is the greatest movie musical ever made and one of my favorites. But...<br /><br />I recently got this as a gift and I must agree with Robert.  The Features (extras) on this DVD suck. The pictures section were but a handful of pics scannned from the original souvenier booklet. I could have done a better job reproducing those images. I have the original booklet, and i enjoyed it just as much now as i did when i first got it in 1968. Better than this DVD for sure. I was expecting to see more interviews and dirtectors commentaries, though Jack Wild has passed away. Very weak little piece about the choreography and logistics of \\"Who will buy\\" and one other scene. That's it!<br /><br />Also the ONE trailer that they provide here is the one that came out after they already won all their awards. Where's the trailers that came out before it hit the theaters?<br /><br />They put the movie on two sides instead of one. Though one can say that they kept true to the movie by keeping in the intermission break. When was the last time you went to a movie that had an intermission? But at the same time, to sit through the 10 minutes at the begining of side two is pretty silly except for the hardcore collector who wants the original movie exactly the way it originally came out. And in that same vain...<br /><br />The musical CD that comes along with this DVD is exactly the same as the original LP that came out in 1968, which is extremely dissapointing since the LP had edited versions of \\"OMM-PAH-PAH,\\" (missing the verses about \\"pretty little Sally...\\") \\"Pick a Pocket or Two\\" (missing the verses about the \\"dear old gent passes by...\\" and \\"attacking the rear...\\") and \\"Reviewing the Situation\\" (middle stanza) to accomodate the length of the LP. The order of songs were also changed from the movie soudtrack to accomodate LP length, also because some of the numbers and scenes were not recorded or filmed in the order of the movie. But with todays technology and other packages i have seen, there is absolutely no reason that they couldn't give us a CD with all the songs in their entirety in the order of the film. VERY DISSAPOINTING! I was more upset about the CD than the DVD. I really wanted the full versions of the soudtrack.<br /><br />The DVD only gives you one choice of Languages... French. No spanish or any other languages. Why?<br />I think this was done very cheaply. I believe that the true fans of this movie deserve better and would pay more for a complete and full Anniversary set. At $14 or less this is sub-average at best.<br /><br />One last comment, they claim that it's HD remastered, but it looks like somebody copied a VHS onto a DVD.<br /><br />Keep your VHS tapes if you got them and enjoy one of the Greatest Musical Movies ever made.

B002O3Z50G|4.0|I never seem to tire of this movie!  Tornadoes fascinate me--even digitally enhanced tornadoes!  I purchased this dvd to replace my old VHS copy.  I was also hoping to download it on my iPad.  Unfortunately, there was no digital copy for the iPad download.  So, I guess I am stuck just watching it on my television!
B003TJ4YU6|4.0|I saw this for the first time years ago at the Museum of Broadcasting in NYC and there was a commercial for Kent Cigarettes before the first segment with the Beatles; the Kent commercial is not on the DVD.  Possibly there were show commercials and network commercials, or perhaps cigarette commercials are banned even for inclusion on DVDs?

B0042JIL2E|5.0|This album is a GEM!!! It absolutely is. Imelda May and her extremely talented group are one of THE BEST and most original artists out there - without a doubt. Although she will never be mainstream, except maybe Ireland (and around) where she's from... and I love that about her, that will keep her from spoiling her unique sound and music trying to satisfy the public masses.<br />This album has a noticable refined sound to all of her songs than her previous Love Tattoo album, obviously it is a bigger production than Love Tattoo but it still has the closeness and intimacy, the cool groove, the good feeling in all of the songs and it does not sound commercialized. I really hope she stays same way and doesn't try to refine her sound by trying to commercialize her songs to make it more mainstream appealing. Mayham and Love Tattoo are must have for the music lover that wants to be thrilled and is prepared to fall in love with this beatuful woman with a powerhouse of a voice and her amazing band. Way to go Imelda and thanks for reminding us how exciting and enjoyable listening to music can really be.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|I am an avid fan of Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.  When I found the complete series on this site, I committed myself to make sure that I save enough money to purchase the DVD set.  When I read the other reviews, I couldn't wait until I got my set in the mail.  When I read that the movies came with the complete series, I was happy to know that I didn't have to search any further for the movies that came after the series completed on television.  It is hard enough to find them in the store.  Purchasing the complete set from this site was the best decision that I made.  The DVD's came in the time frame that the site promised.  I am very happy with the service that I received from this site.  I recommend the purchase of this DVD set and the site.  It took me at least three weeks to get through whole series.  I give this series a complete two thumbs up and a five star degree....If YOU do decide to purchase, I highly recommend it.  ENJOY THE SERIES!!!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I waited for this book with great trepidation. But I needn't have worried. This was one of the best books of the series. It was thrilling and engrossing. Unlike many series this one ends on a high point of quality, leaving you wanting more.
B002ZG981E|3.0|About the movie: I was not particularly impressed with the movie. To me, it depended a lot on the special effects and gee-whiz concepts. I felt that the special effects (and they are pretty spectacular) and some of the editing (esp. editing emphasizing the unusual - and sometimes brilliant - concepts) sometimes got in the way of the story, leaving me a little confused. I was left feeling that I wanted to see the movie over again to catch more of what was going on. An opposing example is Avatar where the effects were major but did not really get in the way of the story. Or see much older example of a story not impeded by effects; look at the movie Dark Crystal.    About the purchase: The 2-disks set was exactly what was promised and was delivered promptly and trouble-free. The picture in BD was vivid and detailed. Be aware that the BD Live download can take a little while the first time you watch the movie.
0439023513|2.0|If you've read the first two books this one will leave you confused? cheated! I still can't decide how bad I dislike this last one. Mrs Collins let me down, not because of who she \\"end up with at the end\\" but how the whole book was written. This book feel like a totally different books then the first two, Katniss was out of character. The writing was messy and choppy, this was just OFF!<br /><br />***Spoilers***<br /><br />Where to start?<br />She does almost nothing productive in the book. How many times was she given Pain killer? how many times has she gone to the hospital? how many times she loses it? cool weapons were created for her yet nothing cool really happen. Why didn't she ask them to rescue Peeta? or at least thought about rescuring him? Insteat she ask for them to be \\"forgiven\\"! And who volunteer to go? Gale, who she never say thank you to, obviously he did it for her! I got sick of how many times they have to get her dressed and fix her hair! She is being manipulated like a puppet, she knows it but does nothing about it, she doesn't how to say it, so don't, she doesn't know how to respond, so she doesn't, etc... What happen to the Katniss we were reading about the first two books?<br /><br />About Gale and Peeta: I don't have a problem who she end up with at the end, but I wanted to see HER to make that decision! Personnally I was hoping Gale but knew it would be Peeta because Mrs Collins wasn't spending much time on Gale's character, even then I felt that Gale was right for her, the way he seem to know her so well, they disagree but yet have that connection Peeta and her dont have. On the other hand I do like Peeta. I think the author was unfair to Gale at the end: He got some fancy job in distric 2, then never heard of him again. It was still unclear who she would pick until peeta show up, Katniss was still hoping to see Gale when she was at the lake on the boulder they use to meet. So her being with Peeta sort of happen because he was there?!<br /><br />This last book almot killed it for me! What the Hell happen?ed it for me! What the Hell happen?
B003UESJH4|5.0|I don't want to write another lengthy and detailed review--other people have done it beautifully. All I want to do here is to add my voice to the many reviewers who have already expressed their appreciation of \\"The King's Speech.\\" It is indeed an extraordinary film--smart, bitter-sweet funny, and uplifting. When the film ended, viewers in my suburban movie theater broke into spontaneous applause. The film, every single minute of it, deserves such a heart-felt approval.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|very good movie had my attention throughout movie not a big ben affleck fan but this was one of his better acting performances
B003UESJJC|5.0|I don't know why other reviewers say that this product doesn't provide the original format but with the edition that I received (Apocalypse Now (Three-Disc Full Disclosure Edition) (Apocalypse Now / Apocalypse Now Redux / Hearts of Darkness) [Blu-ray]) I definitely did. I bought the full dossier version about 5 years ago and hoped for 2 years that this will come out on blu ray. I purchased my player for a movie like this one, it's well worth it. The sound quality is unbelievable, the scenery is like looking at beautiful photographs and the movie itself is one of the best ever made. Over all if you own a blu ray player, this is a must have.     I have not yet watched \\"the heart of darkness\\" which comes with this pack but honestly I didn't get this bundle for anything other than the movie in HD with original theatre formatting.
031603438X|4.0|So, who is Keith Richards?  A young man asked me this question when I was holding this book a week or so ago. I answered by reference to the Rolling Stones: he'd heard of them.  Made me remember, though, just how long the Stones have been part of my musical life.  It's been over 40 years.  The Rolling Stones were formed in 1962 - almost 50 years ago. Amazing.<br /><br />When I decided to read this book, I was interested in reading what Keith Richards would have to say about the public aspects of his life as both a talented musician and a drug addict.  I was also interested in his view of the successes and excesses of the Rolling Stones.  But mostly, I wanted to see something of the man behind the legend.<br /><br />It's an interesting read: the first part is personal history; the second part is public legend; and the final part is where a more mellow (it's a relative term) Keith Richards exists.  Keith Richards has survived the excesses of his past, and his memoir is peopled with many who did not.  Some of the legends (curing his heroin addiction through a blood transfusion in Switzerland, and snorting his father's ashes) are explained and can be dismissed. Others - the detailed substance abuse - serve to underline how fortunate Richards was to survive.<br /><br />Three aspects of the book stand out for me: the historical account of a rock and roll world of excess (in which women were `chicks' or `bitches'); the details of the music Richards made, and those musical heroes who inspired him; and his relationship with Mick Jagger.  The historical account is in many ways not new: others have written about the Stones and memoirs of excess are neither new nor uncommon.  It's Keith Richards's writing about his musical influences and the process of writing songs and making music, though, which makes this memoir most interesting.<br /><br />`Life' is worth reading.  Not just for fans of the Rolling Stones and those who wondered how Keith Richards has managed to survive, but also for those who are interested in the history of rock and roll music and culture.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smithted in the history of rock and roll music and culture.

B004IB28RK|3.0|The music is great and for sure a blues album but the MP3 compression is terrible. The highs are almost gone and the bass is thumping. Has Amazon sold us a 96k MP3 or does the title Low Country Blues have a sound quality meaning?

B00021HBGS|5.0|I can't say enough wonderful things about this set.  We gave it to my 18 month-old son for Christmas and he LOVES it.  The cars stick really well on the sides of the tub, but he also enjoys standing them up on top of the side (they are thick enough to stand on their own), float them in the water, \\"drive\\" them in the water, etc.  He RUNS to the tub because he knows he gets to play with his trucks.  My favorite part is the clean-up.  It's become GREAT fun for him to watch mommy vroom the cars into the bag when it's time to put them away.  This is hands-down our favorite tub toy and I'd recommend it to anyone... girls and boys alike.
B0007TKH66|4.0|I'm not a Trekkie, but I enjoyed this show when it was on, and I'm enjoying it again now. I think this series has the characters (including the Vulcan) showing more emotion. Jolene Blalock is my favorite Vulcan of all time.

B00408MS5I|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 'SINGLE' 2010 CD REMASTER (UK Released) ***<br /><br />When the 2CD Deluxe Edition of Supertramp's mega-hit album \\"Breakfast In America\\" appeared in early October 2010 with a sticker on its front packaging declaring that it contained a superb new remaster by GREG CALBI within - I must admit I was tempted. But I thought to myself - I don't really want nor need a bunch of superfluous live tracks on Disc 2 - and pay for the privilege too.<br />So I left it be...<br /><br />But I recently noticed the cheaper 'single' CD version (released at the same time in the UK with the same sticker on the front sleeve as the Deluxe Edition) on A&M/Universal 0600753304372 retailing in some places for as little as a fiver (a few more bucks in the USA). And it's a bit of a bargain frankly. The 8-page booklet is the same as the previous basic issue (lyrics, a few photos), but the 'sound' is a brilliantly realized August 2010 remaster that really makes you sit up and take notice (46:21 minutes).<br /><br />Calbi is important to Supertramp's highly polished audiophile sound because he mastered the original 1979 A&M Records LP (as well as their \\"Crime Of The Century\\" gem from 1974) - and therefore has an intimate knowledge of the tapes. And with a staggering 2,300 mastering and remastering credits to his name across four decades - he knows his way around a console and a tape box or two.<br /><br />The sound quality is just fantastic - standout tracks like \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" (lyrics above), the lesser heard \\"Oh Darling\\" and the stunning album finisher \\"Child Of Vision\\" with its extended keyboard workouts now sound huge - but without being overblown or over trebled. They're warmer and clearer - and the layers of the original meticulous production unravel on almost every track. I can even forgive the truly dreadful \\"Logical Song\\" and its cringing lyrics. \\"Gone Hollywood\\" and \\"Just Another Nervous Wreck\\" are good too - top-notch audio.<br /><br />If you've been on the fence about this album, then this dirt-cheap reissue is where to dive in.<br /><br />Such a good album overall - and a truly brilliant remaster...recommended.-cheap reissue is where to dive in.     Such a good album overall - and a truly brilliant remaster...recommended.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I had already read the book and so knew what to expect and the movie did not disappoint. It was great.
0385341679|4.0|(No Spoilers!)<br /><br />The fifth book of the Fever series is a roller coaster ride of a finale. So much happens in this last installment that you barely have time to digest when there is another rapid change in the action. It is a tribute to Ms. Moning's storytelling that you need to gobble it up first and then re-read, just to digest all the information packed into the storyline.<br /><br />That being said, and with the last book of this series completed, there are things I didn't like....the pace was very uneven through the five books, with a lot of unnecessary filler in books 3 and 4.<br /><br />Also, to me, it seems to smack of a little too much advertising to bring in a whole host of characters (from her prevous series) in at the end of this book. I felt they didn't belong in Mac and Barrons story, which is strong enough to stand on its own two legs.<br /><br />*Addendum*<br /><br />As I get farther away from the emotional rush to finish the story, the more I realize that it was not as great as I expected or hoped. Contrary to Ms. Moning's statements, I do think she had difficulty in closing the storyline.  The frenetic switching of identities at the end really seems to be a desperate way to wrap it up.

B002QW7ALM|3.0|Its pretty confusing & odd at first - as it should be - its told from the point of view of those who are going through it. I thought the lack of a common language was odd - one of the characters didn't speak english. (They were all chosen to colonize a planet - you'd need more cohesion than that - but that is a minor point. I thought there was too much violence/killing and should have been more mystery/strangeness.  Spoiler alert: I think the idea was that the ultra-violence was the way the \\"badies\\" were being \\"pushed\\" to evolve - by the real bad guy who had been playing his games for a very long time. Having them all collect and sleep near the warm reactor was too \\"Aleins\\" for me. The movie does give many nods to many sci fi movies. The lack of explaination for what happened to earth was just unimaginative - and frustrating. Overall - I'd buy a low price discount copy again, but not pay full price again. I think I was much more interested in space travel, sci - fi, etc. than the producers were - who just wanted another slasher pic.
B0002ADY0Q|5.0|Like some of the other reviews say, worth it for the Salisbury cut alone.  One of my all time most listened to Albums (vinyl) in past days.   Probably have not heard it for a good 15 plus years.   Got rid of all my vinyl albums a long time ago, and there are a few I wish I still had, this being one of them.    So happy to finally have it on remastered cd.
