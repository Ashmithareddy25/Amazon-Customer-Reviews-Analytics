B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It kept my in trust. I was glued to my kindle until I completed the game. I just wish it was longer. I recommend this game to anyone who likes mysteries and puzzles.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|This game is real fun if you like classic RPGs plus there it's a lot of crazy humor. It also runs great on my kindle hdx with no crashes.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Worth reading every time! I dislike Healthcliff and Catherine more each time I read this! Their selfishness is limitless! But always a good read.
0738212415|5.0|Love all of his books - and added this one to our Art Library in our Homeschool.  Using it to teach the kids art concepts - and hoping it will further their studies.  Love this book.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Nice graphics and interesting story line. Just be careful because you'll find yourself spending a bunch of time playing! I would have given 5 stars but no game is perfect and this one is no exception. It takes a long time to build up coins to purchase items needed to progress in the game and your storage vault is small and takes, you guessed it, coins and other items to expand. For a free app is worth the time to pass the time.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Absolutely recommend this game for families - and anyone who enjoys games.  The kids really love playing this game - and I have fun too!  Great strategy game.  Highly recommend.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Great movie! I ordered this movie on a Thursday morning and got it the very next day! I am very pleased with my purchase.
B00EZPCZ5O|4.0|I liked December Underground better overall, but this album is growing on me. There aren't any songs that are so bad that I fast forward past them so that's a big plus and very rare for me these days.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I've only been on this app for a day and whenever I select the tab to look at my recent interactions, the app will close down immediately.
B0013ND30W|5.0|My son loved it, he's a big Disney fan. Thank you for putting it up and it came on time and was packaged very good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game. Not too hard but not real easy either. Would Like it to be longer. Hope to see some more added to it.
B00FLDG52I|5.0|I can't say anything other than AWESOME !!!!!! After all, Eric Clapton puts this on and only the very BEST Guitarist in the World are on it. If YOU LOVE the Blues and some awesome lead Guitarist doing it, This is YOUR DVD !!!!!!! 2 DvDs for the 2 Days this happened ........
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator.  It looks good and works exceptionally well.  I have the free version but it does everything I need plus.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Fasr paced, fun, adventure flick.  Watched it on my iPad , bought it with my Prime account, so it was free.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! It's not too easy and its challenging enough to keep my attention. I can't wait for more levels.
B008XCM18Q|4.0|SAW THE MOVIE BUT THE BOOK IS BETTER. ONE OF THOSE YOU CAN HARDLY PUT DOWN AND CAN READ ANYTIME.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love it!! Addictive, like a workout for the brain!! Perfect for that  downtime at work if u have such a thing. Careful! May lose sense of time! Miss your bus, pass your stop, walk absently off a curb, or agree to anything, just to get back to game. Can&quot;t Stop!!! Looking forward to more!!!
0684803356|4.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls takes the reader on a three and a half day journey starring Robert Jordan who is assigned with blowing up a bridge. He is in Spain and the fighting is between fascists and the Republicans (Robert Jordan’s side). It accounts his time with a group of guerrilla fighters.<br /><br />While the writing drags on at times and in the beginning it is difficult to tell what or whom the dialogue is between, it is a pretty good book. Topics such as love – between Maria and Jordan, the psychology of soldiers, and who God is are covered in this book.
B008JFUS28|1.0|I WANT TO KNOW BEFORE PRE ORDER THIS MOVIE, WHY HAVE ONLY SUBTITULES IN FRENCH?? I WANT TO BUY IT BUT IN ENGLISH OR SPANISH
1451648537|5.0|This book is a riveting look inside the life of the revolutionary entrepreneur – Steve Jobs. After reading this book, I consider Steve Jobs the ”Henry Ford” of our era. The book’s author – Isaacson, does not hold back on the personal, relational, and entrepreneurial struggles and triumphs of Steve Jobs. From his many interviews of friends and competitors, Jobs’ life is out there for all to see and make their own decision about Jobs.<br /><br />This book took me down memory lane as I lived through the last 30 years when computer technology started to where it is today. Much of the long-trenched static innovation was disrupted in by Jobs – music industry, personal computers, animated movies, book publishing, newspapers, etc. It is a testament to a strong desire to take charge of your life.<br /><br />A few character traits that I adamantly admire is Jobs’ steadfast devotion to purity, his reality distortion field where nothing was impossible (he was the master of his reality), and his blunt candor, and his presentations at MacWorld; he saw the world in binary terms – black or white, awesome or s***.<br /><br />One last takeaway – on page 337: (Jobs) ban(ed) PowerPoints. “I hate the way people use slide presentations instead of thinking…People who know what they are talking about don’t need PowerPoint.”

0316204366|4.0|David and Goliath written by Malcolm Gladwell gives insight in the events of the epic battle between David and Goliath. It then portrays the advantages and disadvantages into recent events – battle against leukemia, playing a full court press in basketball, the civil rights movement, and the battles between Protestants and Catholics in Ireland. The introduction is great, it left me with the realization that Goliath really had no chance and that the perceived strength of Goliath was really a disadvantage. In addition David was going to fight Goliath not in the way that Goliath was expecting but in his own way. The part in trying to find a cure for leukemia was heartbreaking; children actually bleed to death while doctors couldn’t do anything.<br /><br />There was a bit of a lull or part when I lost interest but overall the book is good.<br /><br />The book reads quick and I was left with the realization that there are times when faith and the realization that sometimes Goliath can be defeated, that anything is possible.<br /><br />7/10

B007KQ6XYY|5.0|It's a great game, it keeps you interested in completing the stages. It is fun and a good way to pass time. Both me and my daughter love it.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I was really impressed with this game. The story was intriguing and the puzzles challenging. I am<br />looking forward to the sequel!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very fun and cool I absolutely love it different characters outfits prizes updates and new themes I recommend it get it NOW!!!!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This app is fun and all but it kind of takes forever for updates so I kind of not play this app a lot
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game, very addictive. Love how some boards are a challenge and others are not. Great job creating this game and thanks.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Great sound effects for surround sound, fantastic 3d effects.  highly recommended if you are looking for a no brains action flick
B004DGEK6W|5.0|Nicki Minaj is just the best!! This album has everything its really good. the singles will just blow your mind im serious
B008JFUS0U|5.0|Though the film wasn't as good as the first, it wasn't a failure and was definitely a great film.  I genuinely enjoyed the film.  The writing was good, the acting was even better and I loved how they took risks and had fun instead of trying to be all serious about themselves.  The film was funny, action-packed and took chances that payed off.  I really liked it.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Middle - didn't love it, didn't hate it.<br />Not as much as the original but it was OK.<br />Leo gave a great performance.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Great Adventure. Action was very suspenseful. Cast was very good. I always like Star Trek movies and always watch them.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel Washington brings his ability to make things full of suspense.  Has a twist in it that makes it enjoyable.  A few on the edge of your seat moments.
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|I am updating this review from &#34;TEN STARS!!!&#34; in 2013 to to GARBAGE in 2017.<br /><br />I am tired of wrestling with this thing --- not my job!  The FINIS have serious problems; problems that cannot be fixed by customers.  Check the Internet; complaints abound about *all versions* of the FINIS.  The FINIS are GARBAGE PRODUCTS that stop working.<br /><br />Neither my old nor my new FINIS will play music.  When I turn it on, the window lights up but the FINIS flips through songs without playing them.  Have tried too many fixes to list here.  (Why bother, almost nothing works.)<br /><br />At one point what did work was re-tagging the songs, especially the track number tag. But the FINIS stopped playing music one month later when I added new songs.  Re-tagging and re-setting do not work.<br /><br />So I'm looking for a new underwater music player.  Deep apologies to anyone who purchased a FINIS based on my original review.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW, 2013:<br />TEN STARS!!!<br />EXCEEDINGLY HAPPY with this product. Being able to listen to an excellent MP3 player while swimming laps 4-6 days a week is pretty much a life saver. This FINIS Neptune Underwater player keeps me from going bonkers with boredom.<br /><br />Had no problems whatsoever in hooking the Neptune to my PC. Yep, as advertised, it's super easy to copy/paste music to the player. Battery charge time on my PC is about 30 minutes; less than the 3 hours stated in the packaging.<br /><br />When I clip the Neptune to my swim goggles, there's no sensation of physical presence---meaning you won't feel like there's a contraption attached to your head. Also, the player---speakers and main unit---stayed on my goggles, no slippage.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT!!! I was super skeptical about the *listen through your jawbone* thing---but, lo!, this works, and it sounds great! Use with ear plugs and the sound quality is ridiculously good.<br /><br />Be sure to hold down the Play button a full four seconds, or you'll get all mad about &#34;I've been robbed!&#34; when the player does not immediately power up.<br /><br />Will report back if any problems crop up over time, but right now the FINIS Neptune has basically turned me into Flipper.
B0084670FU|4.0|Brad Pitt is always great, must pay attention as it moves around.  Overall very good and we enjoyed watching it..
1781162646|5.0|Great story told by the master story teller himself.  It is not spooky like the Shining, but is more of a murder mystery with a hint of something sinister lurking about.  Read it in one night.

B00BXKKNFS|5.0|[[ASIN:B00BXKKNFS Adblock Plus]]At first it wasn't working, still getting ads. Then, for some unknown reason, it started working. Apps, that usually had large ads, had none. They still had a blank pop-up, but no ads. It's not perfect, but it's still worth having.<br /><br />12-01-13 UPDATE:  I started to get \\"Time out\\" errors and trouble downloading apps from Google Play. I couldn't find the reason. I have an app called Clean Master. It's a great little app that frees more memory by closing background apps that aren't being used. It didn't close Adblock because it was working constantly. It did list it in the memory users as #1. It topped the list at 45 mb. Adblock was hogging all the memory it could get. The problems stopped after I removed it. I have an HTC Droid DNA with Android 4.1.1. Adblock wasn't worth the problems it created.<br />Dr Mark W Helfand

B0084B5TK8|5.0|Having set upon myself the task of reading or rereading a classic piece of literature in between each new release I have once again discovered the masterpiece that is Dracula. Although it has been 30 years since I first read it, it still had me captivated the whole journey through.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm a BIG  Pinterest freak!!! I love being able to browse, pin, look at friend's boards and organize my breasts  on my kindle fire. This is a great app well worth the download! The best part is it's a free app for now.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Was recommended this book by a fellow fantasy nerd and figured she wouldn't have wasted my time had it not been stellar and she was right. Eagerly awaiting the next book. Al Sorna is a magnificent anti-hero. Read this book asap.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|The Terraria game works on just about any Android device if you get it from the Google store.  However, when you get it form the Amazon store it only works on Kindles.  What a bunch of crap.<br /><br />I loved the trial (that I got from Google) on my phone but got this because it was on sale and now I can't use it.  Amazon says they'll have an update out to fix the problem but be warned for anyone that doesn't have a Kindle.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Don't start this if you have tons of other stuff to do. You will say just one more page, then I will just get to the end of this chapter then you are at the end of the book. You then have to come up with WHY you didn't get your work done.
B00EQ30RVY|1.0|I feel their is several things wrong with this album.  First is that they are passing 5 songs as an album, but charging the price of a full album.  Second, it's a generic record.  There is no real growth here for stone temple pilots or Chester.  I have been a stone temple pilots fan since they first placed the Plush music video on MTV (which that statement alone should tell you how long).  I read in an article on the last release of Stone Temple Pilots album with Scott that they called Scott and said, &#34;Hey want to make a million dollars&#34;, and he agree to do the album.  At least they did a whole album.  This feels like a rush job, and they just want your money again.  So don't buy this generic album.  Lastly, I am a Scott Weiland fan.  This album just proves that their is no true Stone Temple Pilots without Scott.  Chester has great vocals, but you can clearly see he is not in charge of the music here.  Scott brought an artistic side to the band that no one can replace, it's just the way it is.  The other member of the band have tried this before with Talk Show, and now their as bold to take the Stone Temple Pilot name and put it on this album.  I can think only most bands of the 90's did this because their lead singer had passed.  A slap in the face to Scott (boo to the band members), and a cheap way to get them more money.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love Castleville  but way too many quests @ one time.  Glad to be able to play this on my Kindle Fire
B003MYYJD0|5.0|Bought this watch as a gift for my boyfriend, it was also a surprise gift. He is a huge Invicta fan and has not been able to stop talking about this watch. He loves it and everything about it
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|The premise for the book is that there is a force in the universe that can be tapped by our thoughts
B00BD99JMW|1.0|How could she do this to us? Boring, terrible ending, poorly written.  Not like the other books, which I loved.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show takes a great story, and develops it over an entire season, with a great ending. Really scary. Great acting.
0307352153|5.0|My friend recommended this book to me, and I love it so far :) It's very insightful and full of perspective. Sorry if that seems broad, but I can't stand reviews that feel the need to describe the entire book to you. Go read it yourself!! You won't be disappointed.
0316055433|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time...I have not even finished it yet and I am already sad that one day it will be over. It is written in such a way that I am laughing and crying about this fantastic kid and people in his life. I cannot wait to finish it and I don't ever want it to end.....
B00915G6WQ|5.0|If you don't watch this series, YOU NEED TO!!! OBSESSED! I rarely buy series, so when I do, you know it must be good enough to watch all over again.
0316017930|4.0|I thought that this was a very insightful, thought-provoking book about the unexpected factors that influence success. I particularly enjoyed the discussion about cultural legacy, the varying cultures of communication, and the differences between the engrained European/American &#34;work ethic&#34; as it relates to schooling, compared to the Asian one.  I also found the linguistic differences in mathematics striking.  The book did seem to drag a bit in sections, but overall, was an enjoyable read.
0439023513|5.0|this series is absolutely wonderful, please read! Im pretty sure I finished all 3 books within a month, and at the time that was while working full time and playing college volleyball full time. It's SO hard to put down! #BingeRead
B004SKHJF2|4.0|Laggy sometimes, but the overall experience is great and finds most songs quickly, the last update also make the UX much more enjoyable
0439023491|5.0|I'm finally doing a review because I'm terrible. I read this series about 4 years ago, before it became popular, and I've reread it twice. You won't be disappointed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The device instalation itself is great, literally just plug the power cable and the dongle on your tv and youre set, download the app on your phone or tablet and play videos from youtube or Netflix right away, no complications, you can also stream a chrome Tab right from your laptop to the TV seamlessly, and for the price range, you just can't go wrong with it!
B000FC10IO|5.0|One of my favorite trilogies!  Wish he would write more on this series! I want to know what happens to Everyone.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have this game for ps3 and Pc since it came out, i got it for android as soon as i could and I don't Regret it, its a great game, many hours of fun and replayability, worth each cent!
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|Every single on this CD is awesome!  It is hard to choose a favorite, because they all speak to me and are wonderful to sing along with ...........
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Too boring for me. A constant repetition with no real story. I found it had no plot or anything redeeming
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun little game to pass the time away. So far works great. Love playing it. Looks pretty kid friendly as well.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For $35, this can't be beat. Simple to set up, works with my iPad and Android phone, and has a variety of supported apps (Netflix, HBO Go, YouTube, etc.). It is improving as they add more every week. Other similar systems seem to be at least $50. A Chromecast would make a great Christmas present.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Better than the Facebook game! The quests are different and much easier to complete. Try it! I promise you will not be disappointed.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop is the best remote desktop app, hands down. It connects quickly, and allows you to use Windows 8 gestures if you are connecting to a Windows 8 computer. Splashtop keeps adding functionality as time goes on, so it keeps getting better. A program needs to be installed on computers that you want to connect to, but it is really easy to setup, and you don't need to deal with it again after that.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|So I just finished Wonder and it was amazing!  I can't believe how good it was! Summer had to be my fave character!keep up th  good work
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My sister wanted HP for Christmas, and this was the least expensive and easiest option. It came in one set, and we watched the whole film collection over break. If you like Harry Potter, and don't care about 'extras', this is what you need.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough. I made it through 90% of this book and I thought to myself &#34;this is really enjoyable&#34;. However, the last 10% of the book blew me away. The payoff from all the plot threads layered through it was really something special. This isn't some literary masterpiece that will go down as one of the greats, but what you have is a truly enjoyable book that was worth every second invested. I can't say that about many books at all.
B00008RWAX|5.0|This was a fantastic book!  It's long, but I was hooked so I couldn't read it fast enough.  Such a great historical account.
B00E38KGF4|5.0|Works good on my Kindle Fire HD. It has stopped a couple of downloads and saved me some headaches in the future.
B009IF82SK|5.0|love, love, love this show! I normally do not watch a show more than once, but I could watch this every night and never get tired of it!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|One of the best bond movies!!!! Totally enjoyed from the beginning to the end. Worth watching with your family and friw D's.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Five stars for Married with Children--  great series.  Yes, the packaging is lousy, but later I got a package of ten triple disc cases from Amazon (get the higher priced one like I did-- the reviews on the cheaper one weren't good) and have put the dvds in those.  Yes, it added around $11 or so to the price of it, but it is still a great price and a lot better than paying for each season.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Awesome, awesome device.  I have used several different portable back up power supply systems, and this is without a doubt the very best. Light, great design, power lasts forever.  Love it.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Divergent is my favorite book ever.  So I was very disappointed in this book.  Such a let down after the first two books.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|It's been a long time since any new album floored me, let's face it, music has been flat to a degree, then along comes Now What? Apparently a break from recording is what Deep Purple needed, each members playin on this is spot on and full of emotion, you can tell they are in synch, one unit.<br /><br />I have to measure this up to Machine Head, Perfect Strangers and Purpendicular, now I have 4 favorite albums by this band, I won't put one against the other, that is for you to make a personal decision on but I am telling you this is that good or better, this flows, this has continuity, it's like a fine wine that aged forever and you opened it, this si to be savoired.  Enjoy.....and great job lads, this is a work for the ages..again.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|its good,<br />well done<br />and personally I like it<br />a good movie that its worthy of watch it, dont missed it
B00DH4BL4U|2.0|Not very informative and just another footballers Autobiography. I thought that there would be more depth to his views on the game instead of on his ego.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|Way too wordy and convoluted. Couldn't even finish it. It started put great but 1/2 way through It lost me.
B004Q3NBXU|5.0|I'm not sure I really even know what this movie (or any movie featuring The Rock) was about!  Was there a plot or something?  Was there any dialogue?  Do we really even CARE???  I mean, I get to watch two hours of The Rock - sanctioned!!!  'Nuf said!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|The screenplay was audacious, intelligent, and screamingly funny. The action scenes were thrilling and scary. At one point, I won't say<br />which, I screamed out-loud in surprise and woke up the house (I had headphones on and didn't realize how loud I yelled). RDJ owns<br />this role now and I rather enjoyed that the storyline kept him out of the suit for long stretches of time. The relationship between Tony<br />and Pepper (a beautiful and intelligent Gwenyth Paltrow) is complete now and I expect we are working towards a wedding after The<br />Avengers save the Universe in Avengers2. This movie was a complete surprise after the &#34;Good&#34; IM1 and the &#34;Pedestrian&#34; IM2 and I<br />had a great time watching it. I even rate it higher than the grandiose Avengers. This is a superhero roadtrip the likes you will never see<br />again.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Frightening, taut and gut-wrenching story.  I thought I had read enough horror to be immune to surprises, but Flynn's Dark Places surprised even me.  A dark tale with long-lasting afterthoughts.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Small & beautiful and big on features.  If you power it independently then it can turn on your TV automatically, including swapping to the right input source (thanks to being compatible with AnyNet+ aka HDMI CEC).  Even the setup was easy.  Compatible with YouTube, Netflix & HuluPlus.  I've now bought multiple Chromecast devices, for every TV I own.  This works just as well with Apple iOS devices (iPad & iPhone) as it does with Android devices.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|This movie is essentially about giant robots punching giant monster in the face with added explosions! If that doesn't appeal to you at all stop reading, and don't watch this movie!<br /><br />Now that I have gotten rid of all those boring movie-goers, lets go over the movie.<br />As I said above it is essentially about giant robots punching giant monsters. It is an action movie, but it is not just non stop action sequences. It has a solid story, great pacing, and amazing actors.<br /><br />I also love the casting of Charlie Day. If you are a fan of Charlie, this movie is worth it for him alone.
B002MFULQO|5.0|Long time fan of this movie and great time to watch this since the 50 year anniversary of this terrible day in American history happen.
1455525839|3.0|This is what I like to call a Pendergast `in-between' story. Pendergast in-between stories include Still Life with Crows, Brimstone, Wheel of Darkness and Cemetery Dance. They are stories that feature the Pendergast character, but do not center on himself and his family. The authors put Pendergast through the ringer, and then give him his down-time stories. They are of course wonderful books that stand on their own merit, ie: Still Life With Crows. However, I found `White Fire' to be a little weak. It's weakness was explained very well by an amazon.ca reviewer:<br /><br />'The similarities to Still Life are countless. A small town. A storm. Corrie making the stupidest mistakes in judgement that are so clearly contrived in their motivation as to break the spell of disbelief. More caves. More inhuman humans loping around making guttural sounds (or was that shuffling around with a loping gait?). A dog victim. Footprints outside Corrie's window. A kid growing up in caves with unordinary strength. A crazy old koot survivalist running around with a gun. They plagiarized themselves. This was a lazy effort for such normally excellent and original writers.'<br /><br />I think this can all be chalked up to the fact that it was not given the attention it might have been given had the authors not had so many projects on the go - or on their minds - at the time of writing. It could have been bigger and better.<br />I admit, I'll probably read their next Gideon novel, but with a certain degree of resentment. Good thing the character has a terminal illness!
B008Y729FU|4.0|Great dark movie I used to watch when I was younger.  Awesome to watch around Halloween, and interesting to show people the scene where he actually dies in real life.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Its a nice little time sink music becomes annoying after a while though. The gold to create buildings is a  bit too much at the start also.
0307476464|5.0|Big, bold and wonderful.  Despite its size I just could not put this down.  I am now a totally committed fan.
B0089OBLDO|5.0|The Best Converter I got yet. Now I can use my PS2 and PS3 controller on 360, and my 360 and PS2 controller on PS3. No input lag which is very important.<br /><br />Note:<br />You need a 'wired' Microsoft Official Xbox 360 controller to use the PS2 and PS3 controllers on 360.<br /><br />Not sure if the play & charge kit will work, but the official wired controller does. Also my wireless USB PS3 hori stick did not work with it.<br /><br />All controllers and sticks I assume must be wired.
B004IK8PLE|5.0|Simply it Is written so that it understandable without previous experience with code or cryptic knowledge and as such, while reading  the body of the pages it is remarkable how far back code was used...before 'BC'!  Just imagine that.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I find this book a tremendous help in developing understanding and confidence in knowledge of photographic principles and the camera. The focus is to teach definite principles and ratios in a person so that they can calculate/understand what to do with manual settings in a given situation rather than simply experimenting or fiddling with controls. Wonderful, and not too complicated!
B002MFULQO|5.0|Very credible. A well constructed and well documented look back at our loss.  There are a lot of competing &#34;realities&#34; and they stay in the most credible ones.  They have avoided the alligator pit of who was really behind the assassination.  That will always be debatable.  The &#34;how&#34; also has streams of divergence, but they investigate the most plausible and exppre the most valid research.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. I just wish it was available for me to get on my windows phone. :(  love the game!!!!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The classic tale of a young hero winning against the odds with courage, intelligence, and determination.  It takes place in the believable near future.  Just enough fear of the future that we may become to engage us.  Good costumes - love the &#34;over the edge&#34; styling.  Lots of fun in the costumes, sets, and background.  The female actor was good, other actors could have been better.  The Game Show host was a great character - loved him.  Believable trials and chase scenes with good pacing.  Well made movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Any 'oddness' here is pure Stephen King. After one chapter there is no oddness. It's all normal. He brings the characters to life as only he can. Even if you're not a Stephen King fan, I think you would enjoy it. All Stephen King fans will enjoy it. Happy reading!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My grandson loves this game and was surprised when his grandmother could download it!  My granddaughter also loves it and it is downloaded on her Kindle, my Acer computer and also the HP at my house.
6304711891|5.0|Although this movie came out about ten years ago it is still an amazing movie with great actors and an awesome story line.
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|Very good movie with a surprising twist.The acting is good and so is the storyline. Not a children's movie for sure!

B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I wish there are online multiplayer please make my wish happen thanks I really do but still this game Is cool so 5 stars
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|This game as great graphics and is fun. I am still new to it but am enjoying it. The only problem is that to really get somewhere in this game you have to spend A LOT of real money. I won't do that so will eventually delete it from my Kindle. I will enjoy it for a bit though.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|But not to happy about having to buy coins and crowns.  Would be better if there was other ways to get them
0689835604|2.0|I wish the book had a few more pages, and the art is not the best.  I would rather some more realistic features i.e. hands, feet.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Greate headset, but sometimes  losing signal for a second. Very comfortable and sound very good. i like it. nice micro
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I seem to be locked into the fantasy genre and this series deinitely filled my need.  Sanderson is an excellent writer and I'm very excited to read more of his books!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome and no glitches at all the game is great for kids and as a lot of characters to choose from.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A great, hard story. This is one of my most delightful (and challenging) reads of 2013. I would highly recommend this story.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Fast-paced plot for an action flick.  This is escape fiction.  Lots of action and little emphasis on language and sex.  The scenry and plot make this movie seem possible.<br /><br />Worth your time.  Put the beer and popcorn on the table - you won't have time to fetch them once the movie is on.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|This cd is totally awesome from beginning to end. I love her and didn't know she had other music out as well.
B00ENIR864|5.0|This works on my Kindle Fire just fine.  I had doubts but the first time I tried it worked just as it should.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I love the story in the third party narration.  The main characters are delicious with the thoughts they express.<br />Excellent read.
0425238091|5.0|Positively a classicd for anyone in medicine or EMS. I just bought this copy for a first year medical student. Based on other reviews, I'll be sure to tell him that it may not mean much to him now. In fact, he may think it's all BS. But when he re-reads it over the years, new layers of insight will become apparent.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I originally bought this as a costume prop for my daughter's Halloween costume. Since she has had this, she uses it for anything she needs to write. (It's a pen too). She loves it. For the price it is a sturdy little device. As I said my daughter loves it. Good Price, works as advertised, not a bad thing to say.
B00ENFS0F0|5.0|It's Star Trek, Next Gen, and beautiful in Blu-Ray.  I converted from standard DVD and it's worth the conversion!  Can't wait for 6 and 7 to come out and complete the series.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I think the easiest levels would be great for younger kids who like to be challenged.  it is quite addictive as the levels get harder.  Easy game to play to pass the time.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is cool. It combines cute with tower defence. Plus it has a lab! This game is really cool. Make sure to update. Have fun!
B00946ZOT8|5.0|i bought this doll to add it to my mother's Twilight doll collection! she's such a fan & she totally loved it!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|It really enjoy this game. It's was really fun. Not too easy, but not challenging. I recommend this to anyone really
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|the characters and their moral dilemmas are very believable. The story is suspenseful. But I wish the author had cut some of the descriptions and inner monologues. The book would have been even better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was so detailed and the ending is so amazing and miseries. I love this book. I can't wait  to read the next one
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Enjoyed the book, but the ending was very disappointing. Why did the author get everyone so vested in a character and have them not make it?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|now I can't put it down!!!! it's challenging and fun.  great way to un<br />wind after the kids go to bed!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|absolutely fantastic loved the length of each show it was like watching a good movie time and time again. I will watch the season again
B00GINENG0|5.0|My little sister and brother love this game. They said that its like a real pet. It's so cute we love it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I was just so addicted to this game from the very start. my sister had this app, I started playing it, then I had to get it myself :D nice game to play when you need to kill time. some of the harder levels make you have to think.  just a little bit :D
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I got minecraft I thought it was a poo but when I got it it rocked and<br />I will be a pro!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I love NCIS, what can I say. I'd watch this team 24/7 if I could. It's a good show and a DVD you'll want to watch over and over, I do.<br />If you love NCIS, purchase season 4.
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|WARNING: This is a critique of the movie and contains \\"spoilers.\\"  The  movie is worth seeing, with much to enjoy.  But see first and read later (if you want to!).<br /><br />There's a lot to like about \\"Mud.\\"  It's well-cast and well acted, it touches on engaging (and oft-treated issues), and it gives us a glimpse of a way of life in Arkansas that has a distinctive texture for all its difficulties and economic limitations.  The problem is, for me, that the movie gets in its own way, so to speak.  A rather clear thematic structure is undermined by aspects of the plot that turn the movie into a kind of shoot-em-up revenge thriller, and that seems gratuitous and not particularly expressive of the dominating themes of the movie.  These dominating themes have to do with love and with the idea that love is unstable.  The idea that love can bring a kind of stability into ones life is one that is cherished by the protagonist, a 14-year-old called Ellis (Yes, that means that Matthew McConaughy isn't the protagonist, despite the film's being named for his character.)  Ellis is watching his parents' marriage fall apart for reasons that have to do with their disagreement about continuing to live in a houseboat on the river so that his father can continue to make a precarious living doing what he has always done.  His mother has come to a point where she can't stand the precariousness, and she's ready to move out.  Both insist that they \\"love\\" Ellis, and he loves them, and the inefficacy of his love for them and their once-secure love for each other to keep the family together is deeply troubling to Ellis ( touchingly played by Tye Sheridan).  He doesn't want to give up his vision of love as able to effect more than it can, so when he and his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) find a man who calls himself Mud hiding out on an island in the Mississippi (where they had discovered a boat stuck in a tree following a hurricane) and when Mud tells them that he is planning to snatch his beloved Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) from under the noses of the family of a man who want to kill him (Mud) for killing a member of the family who had treated Juniper badly, the idealistic Ellis is gung-ho to help love find a way.  When Mud reveals that he has been in love with Juniper since he was Ellis's age, then he seems like the perfect example of the perfect lover.  So a plan is hatched to get the boat out of tree, have it reconditioned with whatever the boys can find or steal (including an engine!), and use it to have Mud and Juniper make their escape.  As the plans go forward, the patriarch of the family seeking revenge on Mud (Joe Don Baker, looking old) arrives in the town (called DeWitt in the movie) knowing that Juniper is there and figuring that Mud must be nearby.  Joe Don brings along a bunch of hired guns to make sure that Mud will not escape them.<br /><br />Well, it all goes pear-shaped.  To Ellis's deep disappointment, Juniper (although she claims that she once loved Mud) isn't really all that keen to be rescued by him, and Ellis learns that her relationship with Mud has for years been marked by serial unfaithfulness on her part.  In her defense, she tells Ellis that Mud is unreliable and a liar.  Ellis is devastated -- this isn't the fairytale romance that he hoped to enable, and he is the more vulnerable because his first awkward attempts to get a girlfriend end in humiliation.  He goes back to the island, excoriates Mud, tells him what Juniper has been saying, and rushes off, wanting nothing more to do with him.<br /><br />So how to wrap this all up? This is where another kind of plot (the thriller) takes over and blurs the thematic clarity.  Ellis, in running away from Mud, is bitten by a poisonous snake.  Mud, throwing caution to the winds, gets him off the island and to a hospital, but his coming into town in such a dramatic fashion tips off the family and killers who are hunting him.  He accepts that he and Juniper have no future and tries to make his escape, but first visits Ellis in his home to say goodbye and patch up their relationship -- he did save Ellis's life, after all.  He is followed to Ellis's house by his pursuers, heavily armed, and the scene is set for mayhem.  Enter the deus ex machina in the shape of Tom Blankenship (Sam Shepard), who has a house across the water from Ellis's family and who has known and looked out for Mud for years -- and who is . . . a sharpshooter with a high-powered rifle (apparently he was either in the Marines or the CIA, depending on whose story you believe).  It's all far too convenient; when the shooting starts, he sits on his porch and picks off the bad guys.  At the end, he and Mud are heading down the Mississippi on the refurbished boat, Juniper, as well as Mud's illusions, having been left behind.<br /><br />This Hollywood-ish ending is unfortunate.  It distracts from our appreciation of subtler representations of trust and love (between the two boys, for example) or between the fatherless Neckbone and his uncle who looks after him, and even between Mud and Blankenship, perhaps.  Unfortunate too, I think, is that the movie isn't all that visually interesting.  It looks fine, but there's no visual rhythm to it.  But see it for the ambiance and the acting.  The boys are very good, and Reese Witherspoon does a fine job in what is really a very small part, as the fadedly pretty, rather slutty and shallow Juniper.  Much has been made of McConaughy's Mud -- he does a fine job, and it's not his usual kind of role, but I don't see it as a huge stretch for a professional actor.o make his escape, but first visits Ellis in his home to say goodbye and patch up their relationship -- he did save Ellis's life, after all.

B009E2WX3W|4.0|This album made me a fan. Covers a full range of emotion. Sledgehammer will make you laugh. In Your Eyes will mellow you out.
B008Y6RYDS|4.0|It's such a classic!  For what it was, during that era, it's a little peek at hippy, 60s mentality and lifestyle.  Gotta love it.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I like it but midas is really hard to beat because he regains health so if u want a easy to play game this is not for u . It has very good graphics for a smart phone game.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is the perfect go to for me.  I find myself using this many times a day for my monthly bills and purchases, would be hard yo live without it.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|This is the best Halloween tradition my family has. Well one of them. But we lost the DVD and had to rent it on demand. Then a few days later I bought this one. For a few bucks more you can have 3 copy's. I keep the blue ray upstairs and the reg. DVD in with the kids DVD's. The digital is on my lap top so I can watch it anywhere I go. Can never have to much of a good thing. Bette Midler is a star in this show. She is so funny and a true talent. You have to buy it!
B003MAQM6Q|5.0|A groundbreaking movie that is still relevant many years later.  Issues of materialism, credit, corporate greed, and looking out for the &#34;little guy&#34;
0307595579|4.0|Purchased as a gift.  The plastic wrap was shredded when it arrived. Books appear to be OK.  Hopefully the books will be &#34;like new&#34; as advertised.  Will know when the gift is opened.
B00GSEDTIM|5.0|I really like this show.  I just wish there were more super hero cameos.  Even lesser known characters will do!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin tends to take the long route telling this tale.  It's a rich, cumbersome read that will entertain you until the end.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is one of the best written, best acted, and most intriguing TV series I've ever watched.  I can't watch just one episode!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game..it is extremely addicting. You have to have alot of patience to wait for some of the thing's to cook or be made. If you don't have the patience you can always pay for the time to go faster, but personally I wait. Good luck everyone and have fun!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its finally on Kindle Fire!!!!! It took a while to load but its sooooo worth it!!!! If you don't have GET IT NOW!!!!
0062255657|5.0|A typically well-written Gaiman novel. This one has enough details from the author's childhood that it fits in the magical realism category.
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|It was okay..a lol dragged out on which character was which..pot heads, strippers, and runaway children along with the neglected child is pretty much what comes to mind when I see this movie..
B001QXCYZY|1.0|This mic will not work with MAC even though it says it will.  I got it to record conversations, it wont even work on my rosetta stone program because its nothing but static.  works fine on my pc, too bad all my software is on mac.  worthless.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|James Clavell is a master of historical fiction. In &#34;Shogun&#34; he takes an actual historical event - the Battle of Sekigahara and the ascendance of Tokugawa Ieyasu (Toranaga) and turns what would otherwise be dry and uninteresting foreign history into a page-turning epic guaranteed to mesmerize everyone from romance readers to war story junkies, and to satisfy them all, brilliantly. I've had two paperback copies that I read and re-read so often that the pages literally fell out and the covers fell off. Now that I have the ebook version, I'll probably wear out my Kindle screen!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This is such a great show, it gets better each season.  the Characters, the cases, the in house scraps....so good!<br />So glad Amazon made this available in Prime...I never watched it but now my top 3 shows.  Watch and enjoy
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Awesome read…….recommended by friends and a very good story about…..do we really know what our children are capable of and to what length will we as parents support them.  Really makes one think of what is possible.
0739319175|1.0|Horrible........worst book he's ever done. It's no good, save your money. Dan Brown pretty much insults your intelligence through the whole story
B005S9EKCW|5.0|For somebody who is an ardent fan of both the stage musical and the 10th anniversary concert dvd (filmed at the Royal Albert Hall) this cinematic rendition was always going to have a lot to live up to.<br /><br />Russell Crowe is a marvellous actor, but his voice makes  him a curious choice for the part of Inspector Javert: his voice is too soft. The part of Javert calls for a strong, strident voice with a hard edge to it, and this is one of the reasons why Philip Quast was so good in the role. Crowe has a Crooner’s voice.<br /><br />By contrast, Hugh Jackman’s soft voice worked very well for much of the film, and his look at the beginning of the film was disturbingly reminiscent of the psychopath in the film “Slaughter of the Innocents”. As Valjean becomes more human, so Jackman’s soft singing voice suits him better.<br /><br />Whilst the film is different to the stage play and concert versions, with some lyric changes that will jarr with aficionados, and with a little less of the humour, it none-the-less draws the viewer along with a multi-stranded rope of emotion that reaches catharsis in Valjean’s final scene. The emotional Catharsis of Valjean’s final scene is made all the more intense for ardent Les Mis fans when the two Valjeans leave together.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway’s deep, gut-wrenching performance as Fantine is well deserving of the Oscar.<br /><br />Daniel Huttlestone goes a great way to relieving the weight of pathos as the cheeky and plucky mudlark Gavroche.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I loved this version of Emma! For me it is up there with the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I think book one and two of this trilogy explored sex and relationship in a comprehensive manner.  This book just lacked the snap of the first two and really--how many times do you have to be tied up before even that becomes boring?
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|Very good, but not as good as I hoped it would be. I'm a liittle disappointed with this release.  :(
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Patricia Cornwell rarely disappoints and this thriller is right down her alley.  I do think that her characters need a brush-up to keep them from falling into the same-old-same-old issues.  However Kay Scarpetta remains sharp as ever.  I wish she would expand her circle of friends so she could spread her wings a little.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is great and very time consuming I love playing this game. It's a great challenge sometime with how they always mix up the objects to find. I never get bored with it.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|I enjoyed watching each of the Mission:Impossible series on blu-ray. I was glad to find at such an inexpensive price.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|very interesting and a lot different then most books written about this time. a different view of things. read in two days.
0393037010|5.0|A classic.  My first in what I hope to be the whole series.  Great price, great condition, and a great read.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Fantastic! The best superman movie I have seen. Henry Cavill has won me over !  Superman 2 better be on it's way !!!!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|So far this game seems fun. You can complete the goals fairly and not need to buy crowns. The graphics are good and the story line is followable
B007A2O3FO|5.0|This is a well acted, suspenseful, time travel story on DVD.  The cast line up is impeccable - each one does a marvelous job in his/her role.  I love time travel stories and this one does disappoint as the young boy unravels a long ago mystery.  At the same time, his interaction with the various characters heals his soul from a terrible loss he is feeling.  Very well done!
B00E9A656K|1.0|not all that fun, kind of boring just press to give it gas and press to shift gears no steering no braking.
0525952926|5.0|Have read all of Ken Follett,s books including first two volumes of the Trilogy, am excited and waiting for the final one next year.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE. IM SO GLAD I GOT IT. I BOUGHT IRON MAN 3 AND IT MADE REFERENCES TO THE AVENGERS. IT MADE ME WANT TO SEE WHAT I HAD MISSED.AND BOY DID I MISS A LOT. ROBERT DOWNY JR AND PEPPER (CANT THINK OF HER REAL NAME AT THIS MOMENT) BUT THEY MAKE A GREAT TEAM. SHE DIDNT HAVE ALOT OF SCENES IN THE AVENGERS BUT ROBERT DID. THE PLOT WAS GOOD AND THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE OUTSTANDING.I HOPE THEY DO ANOTHER ONE. A+++++++++++ THIS IS NEED TO WATCH MOVIE.
B00FQMVCEA|3.0|We tried to see this at the movie theater and my 8,5 and 4y/o were bored. I saw about 1/3 of it before I had to take them out. I thought the graphics were great but the movie was slow moving.
B00GIXWXEO|1.0|Was not a big fan of this one. I'm not sure what it was but this seemed a little too dark, the humor too mature or not funny at all. My kids had a hard time watching this all the way through.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The reader is engaged from the first page in both the story from a legal perspective as well as the drama emanating from historic and deeply embedded prejudices in the intertwining lives.  Grisham's dialogue captures an authentic quality that further enhanced the feasibility of the story line.  Having loved  A Time To Kill, it was hard to envision a worthy sequel. Grisham has once again proven his finely developed skill as a master storyteller.
B005EIS5IW|4.0|If you've known anyone (or are anyone) who has a love of cats then you will get a kick out of these funnies.  I guarantee you will laugh out loud. Some are so over-the-top that you just want to groan but some are so appropriate to a cat lover that you'll be giggling just remembering it later.  Would be a nice gift -- as long as the particular cat lover has a good sense of humor about their cat love. :-)

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Watching Youtube and listening to Pandora on my TV makes this one of the best buys we have made in some time.  We do not have DISH and can't get cable, makes this a great option at a very low price.
1400095204|5.0|Chimamanda Adichie’s novel Half of a Yellow Sun is the story of different characters from vastly different backgrounds and their intertwining stories as the Nigerian army advances into the Biafran territory.  The novel starts with the slow and dramatic introduction of Ugwu.  Ugwu is a village boy who is hired to serve Odenigbo, a radical professor who is at the cutting edge of the cause.  The boy is extremely loyal to his master and will do anything to please him.  Adiechie spends most of the first part of the book describing Ugwu’s sexuality and how he adapts to his new life on campus.  The friction between character’s is soap opera-esque; but Part I is setting the stage for the war.  Ugwu, Odenigbo and his partner, Olanna are stripped of their cushy life as they join the other Biafran refugees.  Everyday Olana must go to the relief center to try to gather supplies while Ugwu must avoid being taken by the troops.  Adiechie depicts the brutality of war and starvation.  Richard, a white writer who identifies with the Biafran cause, sees an officer be assasinated; and Olanna sees a woman holding onto her daughter’s scalp in order to give her a proper burial.  Adiechie includes Ugwu’s experiences on the front lines.  He sees death and dispair.  He loses his humanity when he takes his turn raping a woman with his troop.  Olanna’s sister, Kainene, goes missing and her body is never found.  Half of a Yellow Sun explores people from all backgrounds and their experiences as they try to survive the Nigerian-Biafran War.  Adiechie writes of the oppression of the Biafran people, but she sees the oppression of women and their roles in the war as the most hypocritical part of the Biafran cause.  Half of a Yellow Sun is a dramatic and gruesome novel.  It is bound to become a classic.
B0027MJU00|3.0|This was ok, I liked Gone Girl and Sharp Objects much better. Dark Places seemed to ramble on and on with no for no good reason.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The Goldfinch held my interest until the very end! I was impressed that the female author was able to use the male voice and image so effectively. Readers learned mcuh about the antique refurbishing and marketing trade. The conclusion was realistic.
B00GINENG0|5.0|When Talking Tom came out it wasn't really great Talking Tom 2 was OKAY Angela was great. But in my talking Tom I couldn't put down my kindle it's cute clever funny in away. I hope the make a 2nd one and I want them to update a new room like preschool. Any at a this should be the best kids game of 2013. Even thou I'm 12 ITS F##$&amp;% FUN!!!!
B009GX69RK|5.0|If you're looking for a light hearted show with great writing and fun characters, this is for you. It has a lot of campy moments and can be a bit cheesy/cliche at points, but overall it's a really charming and universally enjoyable show.
B000PAAH3K|3.0|This book is interesting but, in the end, it is not very useful.  It has several very interesting stories but they really don't support the main thesis that for complex decisions one should not research and deliberate, but should jump to a conclusion with less information than might otherwise be obtainable.
B000TENKV8|5.0|That's all I can say about this brilliant album. I was too young to catch Mazzy Star back when \\"Fade Into You\\" was in heavy rotation back in the nineties. In fact, I'd never heard the song until just a few years ago, but as soon as I did, I knew this band was something special. Only recently did I manage to pick up \\"So Tonight...\\" and listen to it. Geez, what an experience.<br /><br />I really don't know why this band has been so marginalized for so many years. Their albums seem generally well-received but treated as dalliances rather than serious art, like, \\"Oh, that sounds pretty. All right, onto something more serious, like Bob Dylan's new record...\\" But Mazzy Star are more than just dainty-sounding fluff. One listen to this album was enough to prove to me, at least, that Hope Sandoval and David Roback are brilliant and talented people. A haunting voice, a skilled guitarist, deft songwriting, and lush production come together here to create something unforgettable.<br /><br />Stand-outs include the aforementioned love-sick \\"Fade Into You,\\" the sparse and chilling \\"Into Dust,\\" the cryptic \\"Blue Light,\\" and the title track, a 7-minute psychedelic trip studded with squealing guitar distortion that still manages to sound lovely. I'm so glad that Mazzy Star have recently reunited and released a new album, \\"Seasons of Your Day,\\" this year. Otherwise, I might have forgotten about them like so many others.<br /><br />I haven't yet fully listened to their other albums, but based on samples I heard on iTunes and the strength of \\"So Tonight...\\", I'm sure the rest of their work will be equally stellar. People, if you're looking for an immersive and dreamy experience in musical form, pick this one up. Chances are, you won't be disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I love these types of books. Keeps me reading for hours.  As I am reading I catch my self smiling and giggling. A good sign that I am enjoying this book. I recommend if you like dreaming of gray.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|Frozen screens all the time.  Frustrating as all get out.  Playing on the web just doesn't work. Sad Sad  sad.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Nice story with multiple ethical situations woven throughout the book.  Satisfying ending.  The characters were interesting and different backgrounds were represented and explored.  Appealed to the heart
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Great writing, but this novel seemed more like several short stories, and the transitions from one time to another were sometimes hard to follow.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|This James Bond portrayal was the closest to the character in the Ian Fleming books than any of the other movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was a great read!!  Caught my attention from the beginning and kept me reading long after I should have put the book down!  Lots of surprises -- Sky and Hoover are great characters - looking forward to reading the next book!  My compliments to Ms. Hoover!
B00DC8O6T8|5.0|Great music! The first time I listened to it I was distracted and I thought it was &#34;okay.&#34; Then I listened to it again with more attention and I absolutely loved it.
B00EA8UEZ4|1.0|I loved the first book &#34;DU&#34; and thought this book would continue to inspire me as the first.  I found a few sparks but my over-all opinion was a book written to boost his own ego.  Really - if you don't like someone's critique, do you need to write a book to justify yourself?  If you felt unconditional love and forgiveness would you feel the need to put another person down?  I'm sorry that my opinion may be offensive, but at least it's honest.  I think I've read the last Gary Renard book, I don't think I could stomach anymore of his crap.  Go watch your movie Gary, it was probably better than this book.
B007D48ASU|5.0|This book is sweet and celebratory without putting too much pressure on the potty training issue. My son love it.
B000063KG6|5.0|All I know is I played this album along with Shhhh, Watt, and other early TYA album to death back in high school and am very happy to get them now on cd, I still have the vinyl of some with a bit of popping and such! HA! But that just brings back the time of analog and imperfection that made it all so more warm and human!  I think IF you are a fan that you will find this album a nice addition of early work by TYA!  I would give it a five, but I feel some of their other albums were, of course, more focused and refined, however I love the variety and bonus material on this excellent remastering.  Maybe you had to be there when it was first happening, and not as a vicarious listener (ten years-plus) after the time it was current.  I am happy to have lived their releases, so I have a soft spot for this music and a lot of other so-called unappreciated albums released at that time - I do think there are a lot of individuals who can relate to what I am trying to express and probably those are also the ones who love this album, too,  Peace, and God bless this band (Alvin and maybe others? gone now), I enjoyed so much the unusual and different albums from them in those high school (and beyond) days, and loved every concert I saw them perform live. I am one happy customer adding this to my other CD versions of their albums.<br />UPDATE: after listening to awesome CD version I am, once again, blown away by this experience! Have now given it the 5 STARS I should have given this fine release the first time I posted the review.  Classic, unique, and a real joyride!
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Anyone who like action and is a fan of Data will like this first book of the series. Now that I'm finished with this review I will continue with book two.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Castleville is so cute!  The tasks are explained well. They are fun and sweet. The only problem is the constant Facebook linkage foursome n e who will never use Facebook. It is a small disadvantage so far.<br /><br />The game is hard to leave - you want to stay and progress. It is that enjoyable.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Steve Jobs over a life not unlike a novel. He was an intense character who had a serious focus on what he felt mattered. Isaacson did a phenomenal job if displaying both the good and the less attractive of Jobs. A fantastic read.
B005HED11Y|3.0|It is supposed to be in HD and the quality was not what I would have expected for an HD show.
B005LBF7CY|4.0|As usuall Danielle Steel books are always a good read and I would recomend her books to anyone. The story flowed along nicely and was just a lovely story of Hotel life and the romances surrounding it.
B00CQZ65BU|5.0|What an amazing woman! Don't usually read biographies but this one has held my attention from page 1! Read it!
B004S5N7T4|5.0|Peter Robinson's books are always a great read and this was no exception. I found myself one afternoon sitting in the sun reading it to the end. Full of suspence, great action and once again had a happy ending. Reading another of his books already.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|I have all their albums from the last 5 years, and this one seems their strongest one yet. A lot of good rockers from these Southern bad boys.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Not worth buying kinda interesting but also kinda boring. I would not watch it again. Tom looks great that would be the only reason to watch lol
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good book I don't want to give this review. I'm pissed but whatever. I only have to write seven more words.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Played on Facebook but the game always had issues. I had to quit playing due to those issues. I almost didn't get this app, I would like to say this would have been grave error on my part because this so much better than the original game and enjoy playing it more than I did before. Thanks for giving me this opportunity to say great job on this game.<br />Dusk74429@hotmail.com
B00G4NUQYM|5.0|This is a fun game to play. It helps to increase your vocabulary. It also helps to learn new definitions of popular words.
B0054NR06K|3.0|It was entertaining but not as good as it could have been. I didn't find some of the circumstances realistic.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this is a good game. has some glitches that hopefully they'll iron out but overall the playing is pretty good. haven't tried multiplayer yet but I looked forward to that for sure.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Nelson DeMille is one of the best writers of our time.  John Corey is my kind of guy - goofy, intuitive, willing or maybe has to always buck the system.  Very insightful way of looking at incidents in our recent history... makes you really think.  I have read them all and love them all - can't wait for the next John Corey book to be published!<br /><br />I read the Panther because I got it by mistake - had to go back and start in the beginning to read them all!
B00061QJZI|5.0|I love Will Ferrell and this is great movie.  Its silly but that is why I enjoyed it so much.  My two favorite parts are when the two news channels fight and when Ron finds himself in the bear pit.
B00BATKPBE|2.0|Mr. Dawkins must be so preoccupied with genes that he has lost touch with what makes him the man he is. The book attempts to focus on the first half of his life and his choice of events and characters to explore are so fragmented and unbalanced that you wonder if this book was just an excuse to make some quick cash. Full of repetitions and space fillers. Many a passages copy pasted from other books and articles and random nursery songs that no wonder 17% of it is the index!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is very fun even on a kindle fire exciting very this gives your thumbs a exercise lol - from Myra tewbe honest
B0064MGU98|5.0|This show is addictive! I love it and the characters are complex and strong. It's a great show about politics with strong female characters. It delves into the unspoken intricacies of marriage and commitment while remaining remaining intelligent. This is smart television and it keeps you on your toes.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|I have tried a few players and been disappointed, but here's another one for free.Requested rating to use. Will re-rate after some time to try it!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is on his game. A rock solid legal thriller with superb characters.  The tale of Sycamore Row captures the best and worst of the human condition in small town Mississippi.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I like it so far I haven't found glitches or anything. Super easy point and click, it's much better then on Facebook it's good for just passing time.
B0098460O4|5.0|we've practically worn it out....Love their voices together and the song selection. After hundreds of playings, it still gives me chills.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this is a great game. Everyone should play this awesome game. It's a great way to get together with your friends on Facebook and try to beat each other's high scores.
B00CZ1TMUQ|3.0|their voices still blend together beautifully, but I did not care for the choice of songs.  Mixing opera and past popular hits was jarring to my ear. I would have preferred one or the other.  I still consider them as my favorites, but I tend to go back to their first album.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  I wanted to know what happened to her, Max and her family.  Definitely a interesting perspective of war through the eyes of a child.  We all know the horrific outcome of this war but this actually gave new insight that probably had not crossed one mind.  Thanks for expanding mine.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|Jack's curiosity results in a slashed nose, but he's not deterred from trying to find out who killed Faye's husband. The plot turns into molasses as John Huston with his signature growl enters the picture. There's a relationship with a woman that Faye is protecting. Jack finally understands what the nefarious water scheme is all about and he tries to get Faye and the young woman safely away, but in the end he fails. You'll find a gem in each performance and the cameo by the director is not fun to watch but essential to the film. The trumpet solo that accompanies the credits is by the man that all the other studio trumpeters emulated and his performance is the treason why.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|The film is good, the concept is well managed, but the end is not in accordance with the structure of the rest of this movie.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|I think this one is their best since Vs. and Ten.  All great songs...Seem to have returned to their roots.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so much fun I love  playing and you just can't stop once you start!!!!!!! It addicting! I play it all the time
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|it was the best book I've read in a while I highly suggest this book to everyone ., left you at a huge cliffhanger though
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I have gotten awesome results from the four hour diet. Don't skip cheat day. I also exercise on a regular basis. But I always have so all I changed was my diet and so far have lost 22 lbs. On my way to a total of 30 as my goal .
B008FSCNTK|5.0|So lively. Even my husband likes it! First saw her live, years ago; and well, you just never know with Diana Krall, she is so versitle in her style. One classy artist!
B004L9MFM2|3.0|Very much enjoyable. We all know Game of Thrones from the TV series, though I know very few people who have actually read the books. I decided to give it a try, and very much enjoyed them.<br /><br />This book dragged on a bit for me. I felt that a lot of information could have been cut to make it a faster paced read. The other books were a thrilling ride that moved at a great pace, keeping you entertained throughout. I felt myself zoning out with this one a few times though as, like I said, it was just too drawn out and slow moving.<br /><br />I do recommend it to all Game of Thrones lovers though even if you know the story, as it does have unexpected twists and turns.
193700788X|5.0|BEWARE SARCASM AHEAD<br /><br />These negative reviews are a conspiracy from readers who probably have no memory after book 1. I know most of the people who loved this book tend to leave fairly short reviews. The best one are the reviews that get straight to the point and thank Charlaine for giving us all enjoyment for more than a decade. It is a gift, and should be acknowledged as such. However, these reviews are probably not going to educate people that did not like this book about why they have read this series wrong. I truly think we can change their minds if we help remind them of the clues that led to Sookie CHOOSING Sam over Eric or any of the other suitors.<br /><br />1) Sam is a shifter - He can live his life as if he is human and go suntaning with Sookie. They can have children together naturally (not that i am saying natural children are prefereable to children that are adopted or result from fertility treatments like invitro fertilization). He also owns his own business with Sookie, so they can save on gas by teaming up (joking). Both Sam and Sookie are the most human of supernaturals. They can blend into Bon Temps society. Sookie by herself is viewed as crazy Sookie, but with Sam she can be welcomed as part of his community.<br /><br />2)Sam is always there for Sookie.<br /><br />A) Sam helped rescue Sookie from thing 1 and thing 2, who tortured her. (Again Sam, not Eric).<br /><br />B)  More importantly, after she was rescued from the fairies, she was very hurt, Sam, alone, was the only person Sookie could turn to to help her heal, mind, body, and soul. It was especially poignant when Sookie called Sam her anchor. (Again Sam, not Eric).<br /><br />C) Who protected Sookie from the Manaed, Jannalynn, Debbie Pelt and family, Andre, Felipe De Castro, and countless others? Sam, not Eric.<br /><br />D) 2 words pink spandex. Sookie turned to Sam, not Eric to accompany her to the sex party to investigate Lafayette's death. Mind you, if Bill had not interruptedSookie and Sam, CH could have ended the books right there and we would have had our HEA couple. Sookie trusted Sam to protect her and boy did he come through with flying colors. I remember being so angry when Eric showed up with Callisto the Manaed. I mean talk about a bad friend. Eric hooked up with Callisto even after Sookie told him that Callisto tried to kill her and showed him her scars. Remember what Eric did? He laughed at her for 10 minutes and then tried to kiss her. Eww. Sookie was lucky that Sam's void (remember Sookie cannot read shifter's minds)  protected Sookie from going mad.<br /><br />3) Sookie point blank reviewed her entire list of suitors in her head and imagined that she was like a female peacock looking for a male peacock. She used an animal analogy and picked Sam, not Eric.<br /><br />4) Who encouraged her to accept herself and her independance? Sam not Eric (Eric always came across as too fatherly and paternalistic to ever encourage Sookie to grow up and accept herself and her independance).<br /><br />5) Sam was the only man that ever looked Sookie in the eyes and told her she was beautiful (not Eric).<br /><br />6) All Sookie's problems boil down to one thing VAMPIRES. Remember Debbie Pelt, Sarah and Steve Newlin, and Jannalynn...? We know this is 100% true becuase once Sookie sends Eric packing with his tail between his legs, she is never again bothered by vampires. Vampires know not to mess with Mrs. Merlotte.<br /><br />7) Sookie always lusted after Sam (Not Eric). In fact when she went to the strip club in book 12, she was not even really even looking at handsome JB Durone, but was imagining Sam (Not Eric).<br /><br />8) Eric was a fling not a relationship. Both of them acknowledged they were interested in sex and not in even starting a relationship. Remember the first time they have sex? Sookie does not let him spend the night with her and sends him on his way home. With Sam, Sookie described the best part of their relationship was not even the sex, but was talking with Sam after sex and sharing the day with him. I think she called it very woman's magazine. Do any Eric fans think he would even bother listening to Sookie? He is a viking vampire for darn sakes.<br /><br />9) Eric was a selfish vampire.It has been said many times and needs repeating. If Eric ever helped Sookie it was always begrudging or not at all. What really got me was the time Sookie asked to look at the secret supe library that Eric kept. Sookie needed information it contained to save her life. Eric would not even let her see it.<br /><br />10) Sam not Eric saved Sookie from Longshadow.<br /><br />11) Sam not Eric took bullets for Sookie to save her.<br /><br />12) Sam not Eric was described as having the best bottom in the series.<br /><br />13) Sookie tells us in Book 11 that she loves Sam, all on her own. (Not Eric)<br /><br />14) Sookie tells us throughout Book 12 that she still loves Sam. (Not Eric)<br /><br />15) Eric spends the entire series dating dangerous women who want to hurt sookie. (Sam stays loyal and does not date anyone but Sookie in the entire series).<br /><br />16) No sex is not everything in a relationship, but it is important. Eric seal sex scene, the less said the better. You would think after 1,000 years he could do it better? Sam and his gracious plenty must be a welcome change.<br /><br />17) I am big on presents (and so is Sookie) and it was Sam not Eric gave Sookie the coat, the new front door, the driveway, the sexy dress, the fancy bathrobe, and the luggage. I think Eric once gave her a plant when she was in the hospital, but even that he signed from the staff of Fangtasia. It was not even personalized!<br /><br />18) World rules 101. Vampires cannot be with humans without them being turned. Don't you all Remember Bella from Twilight? i know what Eric said about vampire vampire relationships not lasting. you all didn't seriously believe him? He is a liar and master manipulator. I know in CH's world vampires and humans have legally married, but that so is not Sookie. Tanning is sookie's religion, no way she gives that up.<br /><br />19) Speaking  of religion. Sookie is Christian, as is Sam. Eric is church of the loving spirit. What is that a cult?<br /><br />20) Sookie's most reliable friend Bill Compton, who had no personal agenda against Eric, even told Sookie that Sookie really loved Sam. I mean if you can't trust Bill to know your heroine's own heart, who can you trust? Bill can feel her emotions through her bond after all.<br /><br />21) Sookie is a telepath and can read human, were, and vampire thoughts. Yes, it is harder for her to read vampire thoughts unless she touches them, but once she touches them it is clear as a bell. Can you imagine how bad that would be during intimate moments between Sookie and her partner? I mean what if during sex with Sookie, Eric thought about the cuts on her back from the manaed or thought about the various bite marks left behind from the fairy torure? She cannot read shifter thoughts, so she certainly never has to be self conscious about her body and his thoughts on it (especially as they age together).<br /><br />22) All the foreshadowing in the series led to Sookie and Sam. Remember when they are in the car with Bubba and he is serenading the to \\"love me tender.\\" How does it go? Love me tender, love me sweet, never let me go. Nothing in this world would have stopped Sookie from fighting for Sam.<br /><br />Love me tender,<br />Love me sweet,<br />Never let me go.<br />You have made my life complete,<br />And I love you so.<br /><br />Love me tender,<br />Love me true,<br />All my dreams fulfilled.<br />For my darlin I love you,<br />And I always will.<br /><br />Love me tender,<br />Love me long,<br />Take me to your heart.<br />For it's there that I belong,<br />And well never part.<br /><br />Love me tender,<br />Love me dear,<br />Tell me you are mine.<br />Ill be yours through all the years,<br />Till the end oftime.<br /><br />(when at last my dreams come true<br />Darling this I know<br />Happiness will follow you<br />Everywhere you go).<br /><br />23) Book 4. Sam could really trust her completely after the amnesia and fall in love with Sookie. It was such a brilliant idea to give Sam amnesia in book 4 as a way for Sookie to explore her and Sam's relationship beyond just their friendship. After all he was her boss and this was a perfect way for them both to let their guards down. I mean the will he or won't he remember there time together drove their relationship for so many books.<br /><br />24) Rhodes in Book 7 a lot of reviews recognize that Sookie used the cluviel dior to wish Sam to live. However, no one else is pointed out how she rescued Sam in Rhodes when a hotel building was about to explode. Sookie risked her own life to save Sam when he was in a position that he could not save himself.<br /><br />25) My favorite Sam line. I hurt with you, I bled with you. Not because of the bond. But because of the love I have for you.<br /><br />26) Sam is a good boss. He provides a safe place to work, health insurance and good wages to all his employees including Sookie (who really needed it). This shows Sam cares about more about his people than caring about squeezing out the last dime from his profit margin. In comparison Eric never gave his employees health insurance, wages were poor, and he ordered his waitresses uniforms 2 sizes too small. Talk about sexual harassment! He also kept a dangerous work place because he was too cheap. If you remember all the way back in book 1, Sookie was staying late at Fangtasia at Eric's request. When it was time for Sookie to leave for the night, Eric chose to shut all the Fangtasia parking lot lights before Sookie had even gotten to her car. Sookie ended up getting severally beaten by the Rattrays  because Sookie could not even see the Rattrays lying in wait for her. I guess Eric cared more about his electricity bill than providing asafe work place. I mean how many dead bodies had to show up on Fangtasia's parking lot before Eric would bear some responsibility? Vampires! They just aren't like us, I guess.<br /><br />27) Sookie and Sam (not Eric) share the same joie de vive or zest for life.<br /><br />28)  Who doesn't love the reveal of what the witch's curse was supposed to do to Sam? To seek his heart's desire and never realize it. Sam's heart's desire was not power or money. It was simply to be with Sookie. You know if Eric was cursed by that witch, his heart's desire was power and money, not Sookie. He would have gone straight to New Orleans to try to kill Queen Sophie-Anne and take over Louisianna. (Wow, I bet Eric cursed to seek his heart's desire would have made a really fun book?...Too bad Charlaine did not write it).<br /><br />29) Who can forget the wonderful conflict set up between Sookie, Sam, and Sam's Dad Appius. Appius, who had sexually abused Sam through his whole adult life, was jealous that Sam fell in love with Sookie, a non shifter. Appius plotted to keep Sookie and Sam apart. Appius literally sold Sam into an arranged marriage to another shifter. Sam's shifter culture approved of this sort of slavery. Sam did not. He thought of it as slavery. However, Sam was given no choice but to agree to the marriage. Appius' pack would kill him AND Sookie if he did not marry the shifter. Sam had no CHOICE. Appius last words to Sookie was \\"You won't keep him.\\" Those words set the stage for an epic battle to free Sam and allow Sookie and Sam to live HEA. If CH had wanted Eric to be the Sookie's HEA, this would have been Eric's storyline from book 10 on, and not Sam's storyline.<br /><br />30) There may have been about 2-3 signs pointing in Eric's direction in the whole series. Had CH put Eric and Sookie together in the last 50 or so pages of a 13 book series, she would have been accused of baiting and switching. The books have been about Sookie and Sam. Eric was a mysterious side character. A footnote really. Thank God CH kept to her vision and did not sell out to her fans.<br /><br />I could go on and on with the neon signs, but i suggest people that did not like the book should really re-read the entire series again!<br /><br />.....<br />Edit to add: I do want to caution all readers of Charlaine Harris to beware that her site may have been hacked. I have no personal knowledge that that is what occurred, but I have seen comments on there from Charlaine Harris that look suspicious. Charlaine has always been an advocate for victims of rape and perhaps has done some counseling. I am concerned that I have read several comments appearing to be from Charlaine Harris that say that Eric will learn to enjoy being a sex slave because his master Freyda is a beautiful and powerful woman. This is a dangerous message that must have been put on her site by morally depraved individuals. Eric may have not have been the right guy for Sookie, but it is obvious that Eric was a victim of Freyda, and not a happy slave.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|I think this version has some dialogues missing in the movie version, anyway the special effects are spectacular and I finally understood some things which had confused me before.<br />Love the line about the replicates memories being lost &#34;Like tears in the rain.&#34;

B00C0ALZ0W|1.0|Some of the author's prior work has been new material, but there is nothing new here that wasn't already available to anyone with even a basic understanding of have a remote team.  Most of it is pretty obvious with the actual &#34;how to&#34; that you read books to obtain missing.  I would avoid spending the money and just Google remote workers or some other relevant term and you will find way more depth than the book provides.

B004X6PRO6|1.0|I tried several times and just could not get into this book.  It won awards so I thought it was my problem.  I have some well read friends who could not stand more than 50 pages.  It seems obscure and hard to follow

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I wanted to read this before my book club read Killing Jesus.  The author is Iranian and did 20 years of research on this subject.  It is not about theology but about history.  It cleared some questions I have had and validated some of my skepticism.  It is an objective report and I learned a lot.

B00CSYRHG6|5.0|You just can't beat Ghimli studios for quality animation and story.  Even if Disney is in the middle of it.  This is one of those heart-warming classics they crank out beautifully.
B002GYS1FO|5.0|Hot music. I am &#34;informed&#34; that I need to put more words here. It's required. So, I've added these extra words that don't mean squat.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Awesome book. Helped me realize why my inspiration for creating things had faded. So glad I decided to purchase it.
0446310786|5.0|This book is a seminal classic, and earth shaking. The book was, in it's time, a prophetic voice speaking against racism in the southern USA. It won the Pulitzer Prize for literature. And it is still a magnificent and excellent book to read and still morally pertinent.<br /><br />The story is told from a child's eye view and it is about growing up in a small town. A black man is accused of raping a white women and he is obviously wrongfully convicted. The court case puts the intuitional racism of that society on trial. The Mockingbird is an allegory of the people who die in the story. The Mockingbird mimics or sings the songs of other birds. In the story a few people sing the song of that society (As such they represent it) and die. And there is an attempted murder on the narrator who sings the most.<br /><br />The characters are enduring and it not only brings you back to the innocence of childhood, but challenges you with the injustice of hatred. This book is set in a time and place, but the issues of racism, hypocrisy, and injustice are universal. Pick up and read.
B002W7J3SO|4.0|Masterful suspense. Great cinematography. Intriguing plot. Cary Grant was very effective in keeping it believable.  Alfred Hitchcock was at his best when this came out.
B00ECK21WO|5.0|Having just recently (in the last 5 years or so) gotten heavily into King Crimson, my musical library contains all of the recent 2-disc, 5.1 surround sound remixes of all of studio titles and just a few of the live issues.  I don't have, like many long-time fans seem to, a deep collection of the live releases.  For someone like me, just starting to collect KC, this is a great way to do it in one fell-swoop.  It going to take me months to get through all this content but I can wait!  I am enjoying each recording.  I especially enjoy the 5.1 surround mixes.  I enjoy the packaging too.  Really nice collection.  Just make sure the settings on your DVD/Blu-ray players are correct.  I made the mistake of playing the DVD version in my blu-ray player and it sounded awful.  At first I thought that was the quality of the audio and was very disappointed.  Then I realized the error of my ways and was then blown away by the awesome quality!  Keep it coming!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|First, Marcus Luttrell is an amazing American and I support what he did and what he does 100%.  I’ve been deployed to Afghanistan where I became friends with several US Navy SEALS and can honestly say IMHO that they are the greatest American’s out there.  They’re humble, respectful, devoted, honorable, intelligent, and very friendly.  So I’m familiar with their culture and love and respect them more than any group of individuals.  I’ve never met Marcus Luttrell, but feel like I have meeting his other Trident brothers.  That being said, his story of his journey through Bootcamp, BUDs, and Operation Redwing was very enjoyable and detailed.  I really appreciated how and what he wrote.  He bashes liberals left and right in the book, which is greatly appreciated and needed.  The liberals are the ones killing American soldiers, not the Taliban.  I remember being in Afghanistan hearing everyone saying that they are scared more of their own country than the Afghans.  The liberal media and politicians need to stay out of the way and let the warriors do what they need to do to protect this great nation.  I am super proud of Marcus Luttrell for hammering this into the readers over and over again.<br /><br />I love all his analogies in the book.  Most people probably hate them, but being from Texas raised by a redneck dad that speaks in a similar manner…it made me smile and laugh.  It’s just part of the Texas charm I guess and if you don’t like it, then shut up.<br /><br />What made me give this book four stars was the ridiculous amount of blasphemy used.  Every page seems to have God’s name in vain.  I cringed every time I came to it in the book and was enraged by it.  Marcus proclaims that he is a man of God, but what kind of man of God talks like that?  It made no sense whatsoever.  I understand the feeling of losing friends and being in situations where you’re fired at by crazy muslim fanatics, but there is no cause for using the Lord’s name in vain.<br /><br />Despite the blasphemy in the book, Marcus is a true example of what a man should be like today and what America needs more of in the form of leadership at every level.  I can’t wait to see this movie and so mad it’s not coming out earlier.  Bravo and keep on fighting.r /><br />Despite the blasphemy in the book, Marcus is a true example of what a man should be like today and what America needs more of in the form of leadership at every level.

B009M4KTEM|5.0|Of the 3 GarciaLive volumes out right now, this is the one I keep coming back to.  Ozzie Ahlers is a beast and Jerry is in top form.  The early show rushes out of the gates with a blistering Sugaree which I rate as one of Garcia's best (compare to 5/28/77, commercially released as To Terrapin: Hartford '77 and 10/17/1983).  Everything about the early show is wild and perfect.  The late show also does not disappoint with Robert Hunter singing.  Another added dimension to this show is that the drummer Johnny de Foncesca Jr. was only ~20 years old at the time.  His father, Johnny Sr. was Ron Rakow's (GD manager) wife's brother.  Jr. grew up learning from Mickey Hart, and was given the chance of a lifetime to play with Garcia and Kahn.  Unfortunately after a 5 month run with JGB, Johnny Jr. died in a car accident shortly after the performance of this show.  Spine-chilling, just like the music played here.  Pick it up.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Howls moving castle is a wonderful, well written, fantasy story. An easy read, I recommend this book to any fantasy lover.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A great read, very engrossing, but the ending was disappointing.  While it may have been trying to be thought-provoking, it just made me irritated with human nature.  Full disclosure, if I don't like the ending of a book I will pan it.  Apart from the ending of this book, it was a great, fun read.
B000XXGMU6|2.0|this boot looks good. its probably built well. doubt i will wear it enough to find out. i can not for the life of me water proof it. i have baked in snow seal 3 times thoroughly. snow seal is a fine product. but just walking through wet grass, no puddles, my feet get wet. its all the seems. they leech water. way too expensive. for $60 it might be ok for someone. not me though. its not a work boot either. its for walking in the mall, on a dry day. they are light. soles very thin. feel like high top moccasins. good indoor shoe. sizes run big. but red ball keds would keep you drier seriously. way over priced. i've worn timberlands for 12 years and they finally wore out. bought these to replace them as i liked them so much. i do not like these except to look at. used for dog walking.
B00EB6F1TY|2.0|Just not up to the standards I usually expect.  Special effects were hard to keep up with.  In the end, it was just a distraction.
0062238310|4.0|Differs from the UK and also from the US versions of the drama. Helps to understand what a fine production this series is.
B00AJLHUA8|3.0|For some reason I expected a little better with the hype around this movie.  It still turned out to be a pretty creepy and disturbing horror film.  When you realize the main twist/plot it almost seems unbelievable..  Ethan Hawke is a great actor- he makes the film better.<br /><br />Cons- Didn't show enough or explain enough about the supernatural entity, there's completely no dialogue in a lot of the scenes- just silence
B003521R6G|1.0|Horrible explicitness and low rating for such. Thought movies were worse today, this one was pretty bad, not again to watch.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app will unfortunetly not let me download it. very irritating if you use youtube for school and need to be able to watch videos on your kindle fire.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|An old man that goes around getting in the way of his son. Just a sad formula for a movie.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Just did not hold the suspense for me.  I will read Mockingjay and see the movies.  No one could portray Katniss as well as Jennifer Lawrence !
B00F91SCXC|2.0|I don't watch Zombie movies and I don't know why I didn't connect the dots with this one, probably because it was one of those late night choices. Very sketchy plot - not believable characters - this is Pitt cashing in on the Zombie money.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful series. Great characters in an interesting, if somewhat melodramatic storyline.<br /><br />The streaming works quite well and was in all but one case exactly like watching it on DVD. In one case it did have to buffer, but I think that was due to other network traffic and not any fault of amazon. Just having access to prime videos has made amazon prime well worth the money.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I have a couple of games on my iPhone, but this is the first game I have tried on my Kindle Fire. I am enjoying it immensely! You can get a lot from the game without the need to spend additional money on the microtransactions, though I am sure it would speed up gameplay. A fun distraction with the added bonus of offline mode which is wonderful!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!!!!  I am addicted to playing it.  The bad things are that you only get 5 lives at a time, and you have to pay for different quests.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Was under the impression that I could use this app to effectively Photoshop multiple images together (I don't know, maybe because the app is called pic shop.) Turns out, I paid for the same basic effects that my kindle is already capable of. I want my coins back.
0316055433|3.0|A good plot, well written, but 700 pages?<br />About 200 pages are wasted on lurid descriptions of trips taken using various and sundry chemicals, weeds and alcohol.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love this book. Such a great sequel. My only complaint is that the publisher placed 'digital rights restrictions' on this book. Boo.
B00003CXWV|4.0|Very graphic and very sad in my humble opinion, but a great movie.  Johnny Depp gives a stellar performance as he always does!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just a great book. I was sad it was all over. Can't wait for the 2nd movie to come out.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Still learning how to use it on my Note 3 and it is great!  Love how you can read the other translations of a scripture with just tap! This version is such a gift!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game has lots of new vehicles and lots of new jet packs and endless adventures get the game so you can see all the fun for yourself.
B000YMHOUS|5.0|It was entertaining  as well as a satire on the mores of America. No one picked up on that more than my 90 year old mother who was watching this movie on my Kindle in  my home.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is perfect for my seven year old daughter and I have fun playing it also. It is so addicting. I usually don't like games like this but this one is cool. I would definitely recommend this game. Plus I got coins for download ing it.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I like McConaughey so right there may make me a little biased. Still it was a good flick and entertaining. A little over the top but it made me laugh.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved the story, However, I have come up with at least 7 different more satisfying endings. Mrs. Roth really should not have killed off Tris.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Awesome special effects, really big stuff, likable characters. Some good laughs, doesn't take itself too seriously. A must for Sci Fi fans.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|Elton John strikes again with another amazing album! The songs are easy to relate to and I really enjoy the complex arrangements of some of the less used instruments not heard in modern music. This is a refreshing break from today's high paced pop music that seems to always have that autotuned sound. With Elton I hear none of that.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|This is Celine Dion singing Rock/Soul.<br />It beautifully done.<br />And check out that CD cover photo--just lovely.<br />She sings with Stevie Wonder.
B00BRGL3U2|5.0|Credo with Helene Grimaud on piano is just out on BD Audio [only]. Absolutely wonderful. The SACD version of the same performance earns all 5-star ratings. The &#34;video&#34; on screen menu says 192 kHz/24 bit, but the box indicia indicate 96 kHz/24 bit for all three codecs, LPCM, DTS HD Master and Dolby TrueHD audio. Likewise, my OPPO BDP-105 also reads the audio as 96/24. If anything, I would think BD-A is potentially superior to the SACD as a high quality digital format, although I have not heard the SACD version of Credo myself. I do have more than a few SACDs, and my BD-A collection is also growing.<br /><br />The performances include works by Corigliano, Beethoven and Part, just as for the SACD and CD. For the CD, one person gave a one star user review for clipping distortion. Whatever issue might have existed on CD in that person's setup, the BD is pristine as to any technical fault in my setup; it sounds absolutely fabulous. It remain a stereo performance, not remastered to 5.1 as many older movies have been for BD. As to lacking 5.1, I would argue why mess with what is pretty much perfection? And, the BD-A is currently much lower in price than the same thing on SACD, so it's a great bargain to boot. A keeper for sure in my book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is the Best!  I read this book for my book club, and although it is a tough subject (kids with cancer), the characters are all so endearing and funny and the writing is so good that I could not put this book down.  Well, I couldn't stop sliding the pages by on my Kindle.  Even the minor characters - parents, Van Houten, his assistant - all interesting and layered.  Augustus, Hazel Grace, Isaac - you must meet them all in the pages of this book.
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|The graphics were great. I think the story was a bit short, however it was challenging enough. Worth the price for sure. It took a bit to get used to the navigation, and the green goo scene I could have done without (too long there). But there is plenty to explore and play with, you won't be disappointed.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|So far this maybe the best city building game I've played. I like the fact that if you need money to get something you can make stuff and then sell it at the market. The one thing I would like to see is the ability to obtain crowns at a better rate.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This is a great product that has a lot of hype and let me first say that I am writing this review as a true techie/geek - so my experience level is high with these types of products. I already use other streaming media solutions (android based) in my home so user experience is not what I'm writing this review about. I think this device will be great for the average user - ONCE THEY GET SOME APPS FOR IT! I couldn't believe how limited I was from my phone and computer with what I could share. Was it easy to do? Yes...and the setup was very simple....but this is not enough for what I was looking for. This product is going on the shelf and I'm using another android stick instead until they can come out with more options. I'm disappointed, but have faith that a google product will catch up - I'm just not willing to wait.
B00EVW04PE|4.0|This movie was action packed and fast paced.  It had some pretty good humor in it as well.  Although it did play on a premise used several time before in other movies, it was very entertaining.
B00B1TJO10|5.0|I hate stats - and to read - but I love this book! I had to get it for class, and it's actually been able to keep me engaged! The author is funny and realistic. The concepts are real world and the online resources really help.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really liked the book but was disappointed by the ending.  It left too much open and I would have liked to have seen more from the characters, it just left me hanging and wondering.
B0021L9ME6|5.0|I love this movie. I received it today and think its great. I don`t know why so many other reviewers say its rubbish its not. Its fantastic and Halle Berry took a great part. its a shame there wasn`t a sequel I would have bought it. Its Perfectly wonderful in my opinion. it should have 20 stars not 5. it says on amazon website that this Blu-ray disc is region A1. but its not its all regions as it plays on region B which is where I live in the UK.
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|Two years after releasing the Dubstep-infused The Path of Totality, Korn has returned once again with their eleventh studio album, The Paradigm Shift. It's no secret that the Korn fanbase has continuously found itself split after nearly every album released by the band over the past decade. Most complain about the group's musical direction, which is why their last album was such a risky move. However, those worried about another Metal/Dubstep fusion should fear not. Because in the ditching of Dubstep, the band has also reacquired Brian \\"Head\\" Welch, and The Paradigm Shift winds up being one of their most artistically creative albums from the past few years.<br /><br />With that said, though, it should be noted that the use of Dubstep has not been completely scrapped. Although its use is definitely not as prominent on this release, there is no denying that the band has yet to give up on the harsh Electronic subgenre. Throughout the album's 43 minutes, the faint sounds of their last release can be found lingering in the background of most of these songs. There are some songs, like \\"Spike In My Veins,\\" where it's more noticeable, and there are others, like \\"Prey For Me,\\" where it seems to blend in with the screaming guitars and crashing drums to create something truly unique.<br /><br />It took me about five or six listens before it caught my attention, but one thing I found most interesting about The Paradigm Shift is how you can hear influences from their past releases on almost every song. In fact, some of these influences are so strong that you would assume the song is a few years old. Depending on which albums you like and dislike, this could either be a good or a bad thing, but I thought it added a certain level of nostalgia, which helped further my enjoyment of the music present on the album. For example, \\"What We Do\\" sounds like something that would have been found on Remember Who You Are, while \\"Mass Hysteria\\" sounds like something that would have been heard on their Untitled album.<br /><br />In addition, Brian Welch definitely makes his presence felt on the group's latest effort. He may have been absent from the band for eight years, but he came out swinging and provided some of the best riffs found on any Korn album in recent memory--funny, as I type this \\"Punishment Time\\" just came on. I mentioned influences earlier, and some of the riffs heard on The Paradigm Shift sound like they were ripped straight from the late 90s. The two that stood out the most to me are found on \\"Love & Meth\\" and \\"Punishment Time.\\" They're balls-to-the-wall insane, and they instantly put a smile on my face when I first heard them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, The Paradigm Shift is not perfect. In fact, it's far from it. For starters, the album's first single--\\"Never Never\\"--didn't impress me when I first heard it, and that didn't change after giving the album ten strong listens. Beyond sounding extremely out of place on the album itself, it's also one of the weakest songs Korn's ever released. Although the band's use of melodic, gut-wrenching songs is quite prevalent throughout their discography, this is not what \\"Never Never\\" is. Instead, it's an obvious attempt at a radio friendly song, but it just wound up sounding like a U2 knockoff.<br /><br />Finally, The Paradigm Shift is also plagued with some terrible repetition. Much of the lyrical focus has shifted to creating these grand, larger-than-life choruses, which results in the verses sounding like an afterthought. These \\"verses\\" usually don't last more than a few sentences and, as a result, we get to hear Mr. Davis repeat the choruses over and over and over again. Don't get me wrong, the choruses found on this release are all very well written, and extremely addictive, but I need more than that. Even if Jonathan had just added an extra two or three lines to each verse it would have made a huge difference, but, sadly, that wasn't the case.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Love & Meth,\\" \\"Mass Hysteria\\" & \\"Punishment Time\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 7.9/10 - Truthfully, I had some pretty low expectations going into this album, but Korn surprised me. While The Path of Totality wasn't really my cup of tea, I found The Paradigm Shift to be an enjoyable experience from start to finish. Although it does have it's flaws, The Paradigm Shift is undoubtedly one of the most unique efforts we've heard from this California collective in quite some time, and I would highly recommend any Korn fan to at least give it an honest listen.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book is truly moving.it felt like there really was a Hannah baker who committed suicide. I recommend this book. Truly amazing
B00BAXFECK|3.0|waaaaaaaaaaay too long. you kjeep yelling at the book - &#34;I get it. Get on with it!&#34;  a great start and then......
B00ALKO9WE|3.0|Nice easy read. Story line a little thin but writing style makes it a lovely and entertaining read. A good read for teens to get them interested in reading. I love the history on the book, given it was banned in several states, which of course makes for a much more interesting read.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|This movie is the best sequel since Star Wars.  They have incorporated they details from the first book to the second beautifully.  It flows.  The second book has been shown in a way that really makes you feel a part of their lives.  I have read all three books and love them.  This movie felt like a completion of my vision while reading the book.  Nothing has been left out.  Five stars.....
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Well written and a lovely way to present history so that I might actually remember it. Some bits are a bit too cheesy and lack a certain depth, but on the whole I loved reading it and was entertained for most of the book.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I really enjoyed Thor. I love sci fi and that's what hooked me to this movie. Nothing wrong with a love story attached.

B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|It was a very funny movie.  I don't know if I really believed that Jennifer Aniston was a stripper though.  The cast was wonderful together.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Wonderful, smart program for thinking audiences.  Love Benedict and Martin as Sherlock and Dr. Watson.<br />Looking forward to purchasing Season One.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Definitely makes a good initial impression.  It is a &#34;cool&#34; product, is cheap and is easy to setup.  However, software is unnecessarily restrictive for using Netflix in Canada (many discussion online about this ... be warned comrade Canadians!), and there is still no support of PLEX.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Held my interest to the point where I could not put it down!  Want more titles by this author.  Like Tom Clancy and Arthur Conan Doyle
1475143389|5.0|Although I feel my weight training techniques are up to par, I definitely needed to re-evaluate my diet to truly accomplish my goals. Mike Matthews does this with a seemingly simplistic (and I mean that in a good way) approach to eating. In today's world of &#34;best&#34; diets, it was actually refreshing to see Mike go back to basics with stressing more Caloric intake, but then specifically breaking that down to macros. It was so convincing to me, I went on his site to purchase a meal plan, and am excited to start. He's well informed, and does site studies to back his ideas. And despite my weight training already being effective, I still found myself agreeing with much of what he says in that regard too. And I am in NO WAY affiliated with Mike Matthews from a business standpoint, just discovered his website 2 weeks ago and just see eye to eye on much of what he says. Keep it up, Mike.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Looking forward to rest of the series and the movie<br />Can't wait to start soon.  Great job on. The book
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Sequels have been known to become rather stupid. But this &#34;Iron Man 3&#34; delivered well. Pretty action packed with humor and a twist.
B00G4U7TO0|5.0|It's great to see the &#34;no frills&#34; energy of the 60's folk scene reproduced so faithfully. I was expecting only nostalgia but was happy to hear a new vitality in these songs.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|The graphic animation appeared realistic. The storyline was digustable. It had a lot of action that helps an action movie. The characters were believeable.<br /><br />I gave it a 4 because like many sci-fi movies they have a choppy flow on character introductions. I mean getting the audience to know the characters and why they are who they are
B00CCR9P0U|5.0|I purchased a different model which seem like it was going to break really easy.  It was made of &#34;thin&#34; plastic and I return it to get this one.  This cutter is made of thicker/hard plastic and feels solid & way tougher, so I hope it last a long time.  My only gripe is storing it away...it is a bit bulky.<br />Now how does it work:  It has it 4 cuts as advertised and it easy to switch.  This spiral cutter is so easy to  use that my brothers 10yr old son had no problem going thru my refrigerator and spiral cutting everything from carrots, cucumbers, potatoes, squash & zucchinis in minutes.  An we even peeled an apple first and then spiral cut it too.  Really &#34;easy&#34; to use.  Just be careful when washing to not touch the blades on the bottom.
B004CT5GOU|5.0|very nice ,well constructed , furniture  my granddaughter loves it! she plays with her dolls and uses the dolls play puppies and adds them to the house ...so cute
B00CFA225Y|4.0|Great story!  Laughed at the body gestures.  Exciting,  even for adults.  Sorry my teenage grandson didn't get to watch it.  Just a bit disappointed in the 3D aspect.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love love the era, each person is so different in their role...Just love Downton Abbey and wished it was on more than one night.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|A couple of friends had recommended this show, but I had been watching shows that have now ended or are on break (breaking bad, GOT, mad men, Justified). Watched the first season the first week - it's a great show. The characters are fantastic... It's fast paced and non stop action. Great show!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm usually good and figuring out the &#34;Who dunnit&#34;, but this book fooled me.  Good read if you love mysteries!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I found the story profoundly moving. The story was interesting to me, as I was born in 1944, and find the era of this story fascinating. When I was in grade school, Patriotism was extremely  moving, and the stories of our military and their personal lives move me.  Although my father never served (local draft board declared him 4F due to the needs of our small community during the War)  I felt he served in other ways.  All three of my brothers served in their time, the oldest served during the Korean Conflict, retiring after 27 years as a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy, the second served in the National Guard during the Cold War, and the youngest spent 6 years in the Army, stationed mainly in Germany at the time of the Vietnam War.  My oldest son served in the National Guard, and the second son, 24 years in the Navy covering the years of Desert Storm and Desert Shield, retiring as a Chief Petty Officer.  He now helps manage the Nebraska Veterans Cemetary in our home town.  I'd say I was pretty well connected with the military.
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|Surprisingly good! Great family movie night flick. I would happily watch this again with my 7 & 10 year olds.
B002N21UKM|5.0|Great movie! Really liked movie! Would recommend it to everyone! Real feel good movie. You will love love it! Wonderful
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is one of the best. Vince passed before his time, his best work was yet to come.<br />This is a must read!
B00FXMECS6|5.0|Great movie! If you liked the first Red movie, you will love this one! Bruce Willis and Mary Lousie Parker play their usual great parts.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Nice game. Wish it was longer for the price I paid. All in all fun! Will there be a second one?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the book more than the movie!!! I'd recommend to read the book first before watching the movie. Descriptions are more in detail and the book explains it all.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|great game. handling via tab tilt is awesome and great selection of cars.<br /> stills new but awesome tracks to. upgrades are easy

B0037NVM2C|3.0|I wish I had gotten the original version not this extended version that had a lot of scenes that [I felt] took away from the action of the movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Caught me by total surprise at the end of the book! I have to wait until December until I can check out the next book!!
B007QA3AH2|4.0|Funny family movie.., some hilarious fall down laughing moments... great characters, well cast., Sigourney Weaver was great....a feel good movie.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|I bought this for my wife as a &#34;just because&#34; gift. She was very excited that we ended up watching it the moment she was able to unwrap it. We haven't watched the 3D yet, but did watch the Blu-ray version with our son. It was different for my son to watch because he is so use to watching pixar type movies/shows. But nonetheless he wanted to watch it again. And it made my wife happy.
B009VL28W2|4.0|Metallica holds a special place in my heart.  They were my first favorite metal band.  Being a child of the 80's, I found that AJFA and MOP were the definitive albums to own.  Watching this blu ray kinda makes me sad, because Lars is absolutely bringing down their live shows.  He is a terribly sloppy drummer, whose internal metronome needs to be tweaked.  Even Kirks solos have gotten to be quite meh over the years.  James and Robert kick ass, nuff said.  The audio is decent enough on this, but I expected more.  The newest Dream Theater Blu ray is how a live concert should sound.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Solid experience, from the beginning to the end.  Eclectic and beautiful, talented and imaginative.  Certainly an event of the year for me.  Bravo!
B00F1W1SS0|5.0|Perfect Picture.  Amazing lossless audio.  Anyone who is a fan of music perfection must own this.  Even if you are not a Die Hard Dream Theater fan, such as I, take a look at this one, for the sheer sonic awesomeness of this Blu Ray
B0063GORYU|4.0|EASY GAME THAT GOES FAST AND YOU CAN CHALLANGE YOUR SELF BY ADDING ADDITIONAL SUITES.  SELECT YOUR DEGREE OF FRUSTRATION!!!
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|I love this set and so do my kids.  It is the perfect size for them to play with at their play kitchen.  The salt and pepper make a realistic sound (beads inside) when you shake them and my kids love that.  It's a really cute set.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|This game is so amazing u kill tons and tons of zombies and buy super cool cars and guns it's so fun get it now definitely worth 1.19
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Great story.  I like Zellweger's acting and this story showed that women do have a head for good business decisions.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|This is a really fun game with just enough brain teasers to keep a person interested. I have played several games of this type in the past, and this one rates up there with my favorites.<br />Now, the downside. In the game you do go back and forth a lot. A LOT.<br />I also had some glitch's that seem to come at a poor time. I would have to restart the game but I only lost my very last move so it wasn't the end of the world. And sometimes the game locks up and that made me say WTF a few times. But all in all I have spent several fun hours playing this game. I did pop for the full version by the way. It was money well spent.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|So beautifully and perfectly written. All characters and stories were incredibly entertaining. Can't wait for her next novel!  Thank you!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|nice game my kids love it and i kinda got addicted to it haha and it is nice with the graphics
B00FGM0JTY|5.0|I love the music and it was great to know the history of Muscle Shoals and all the players. Plus...it was very well done.
B00DSOG0QS|4.0|When author Sameer Ketkar offered his book free for two days through Goodreads.com, I read the description and said sure, why not. And happily, it was a good decision. The plot moves along quickly and held my attention throughout. Since it's short - just 132 pages - I finished it up quickly despite a pre-Thanksgiving lack of spare time. I will say, though, that 132 pages isn't quite as short as it sounds; at least on my Kindle, the type was noticeably smaller than most of the other books I download, which would add a few pages to the total.<br /><br />The story involves bioterrorism and the Callahan family of geniuses - well, except perhaps for one son, who narrates the story. Apparently, when the IQ numbers were being handed out to the family he got short shrift, although he doesn't seem to be seriously lacking in the brains department. When a rotting corpse in a swanky hotel turns out to be infused with a highly contagious strain of something unknown, the parents head up the crisis response team trying to identify (and thus find an antidote for) what ailed the body before it turns into an epidemic of major proportions. All three of their children - a daughter and another son who's more than a little quirky - get involved to one extent or another, as do others at the hoity-toity school for the gifted all three kids attend. Add in the fact that the parents are sexoholics supposedly in recovery, and there's plenty of fodder for kinks and twists.<br /><br />Everything manages to get resolved - well, almost. This is, by the author's own admission, the first in a series; no word as of this writing when Book #2 will be released, but suffice it to say there's a need. So if you're a person who must have every single detail neatened and tidied at the end, this might not be the book for you. As for me, I'm looking forward to the next installment. I've got my suspicions as to where things are headed, but I'm not telling!
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|WOW! This Sailor Moon dolls is SUPER DETAILED.<br />I really love it! It is one of the best collectionables I have ever bought.<br />I've been a fan of Sailor Moon since I was a child and this figure is SUPER NICE.<br />It even comes with Luna.<br />Completely recommended for all Sailor Moon Fans! :)
1452101248|5.0|Great cookbook. I am working my way through this book and so far have tried about 15 recipes. All are excellent.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Love this game! I really like it and my sister also does.<br />It is super fun and new features are very nice! Love it.
B000VOC90Y|2.0|FIts my 17\\" MacBook Pro with no issue. Lots of nice pockets to organize things, but the main area is not large enough for many books or travel clothing. Feels comfortable to wear. Needs a little padding at the base of the backpack to absorb ground impact on computer. The mesh site outside pockets are nice for water bottles and such. I ended up switching to the eBags TLS Workstation Laptop Backpack which I love. It may not look as nice as the Ibex, but the eBags TLS Workstation Laptop Backpack is way more roomier and more functional for my purposes. The only thing I like better is the Ibex mesh outside pockets.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. Enough levels and great fun. Not too hard<br />I like much.<br />Jelly levels are fun.<br />Load this game.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the story of a boy taken from his family at the age of 6 and placed into a brutal, competitive, rigorous military style training program.  To survive, he must compete against older boys, usually having to outsmart them as he is physically years behind them in development.  I enjoyed the book, but the reason I gave it five stars is the effect it had on my three sons. Each boy started it and virtually disappeared until they had finished it. The youngest is 10 years old, and he read this book in less than a week. He was reading every spare minute of the day. Good youth literature is hard to find. Literature good enough to tear young eyes off electronic screens is worth the effort looking!
B0082RHRHC|4.0|Good classic! A must read for anyone interested in classic literature. Bronte was an inspiration to women writers of the day!
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Another day in the life of Booth and Bones. It is amazing that I am still watching this after 8 seasons. The stories are quite captivating and the interplay among the characters is what keeps me coming back for more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good game very addicting. Started game as a new player and next thing I knew I'm on level 65. I think everyone would enjoy playing this game.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have always been fascinated with John Grisham's books. I love how he focuses on the South and its people. Always exciting and yet an interesting and, I believe accurate, picture of things that can happen in real life.
B008NMT684|5.0|Great for my grandchildren to play while I am doing something else.  Would recommend it to everyone!  Great on the new Kindle.
B00FLDG5BE|1.0|The BD is completely out of sync, and not just some parts as I stated before, and I'm using an Oppo BDP-83SE, via the analog stereo section, (the 5.1 is out os sync as well BTW) using the HDMI will do the same out of sync as well...a real shame those guys in 2013, have no clue of how to master and produce a real BD decently with no out of sync issues...<br />BTW  I have two Oppo players and the same crap on both and a ES Sony...the analog and the HDMI both is out of sync, like they were using the video from a different night in some parts...<br /><br />BTW and a clarification note, in this release the out of sync is not because of the use of the HDMI or not, the audio belongs to a different performance, simply as that, maybe some studio work or different night, as some words are in sync, and some are not...using HDMI or analog will give you the same result...I had watched it several times already, same result, BTW...the other BD I ordered from Rush, The Clockwork Angels Tour, is perfectly fine!!!!<br />I have all Crossroads performances in DVD or BD, and this is the only one with the problem!!!<br /><br />BTW what is the interest in Citizen Cope or his wife, sorry guys but I do feel they are simply in this event useless, and pushed by Doyle...they are one of the 3000's artists out there, talented or not, but with no beef to be in this event, ever...OTOH Allan Holdswoth the probably best guitar player of our time, was not even in the video, not even mentioned, the last time they ignored also Pat Metheny and Neil Schon...WTF is wrong with you Clapton???
1439153663|5.0|Just love reading about what people have gone through.  Makes me realize how much did not know what was going on behind closed doors!

B006M4F67A|4.0|Kinda hard to see.  Maybe in brighter colors would help.  Love working the Mahjong while waiting places. Nice to have on Kindle.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|The new one is fun, but nothing beats the original.  Yes, it's cheesy in parts.  Yes, the special effects are showing their age.  But my 13 year old son enjoys it as much or more than we do; it really is a classic.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love calling up FB.  Love ,u mew Kindle and what all I can do on it!  FB is a great way to keep up with out of town friends.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Great gift for any fan of Minecraft, and small enough that it works well as a display model (so it's not just a toy).  My 13-year-old son couldn't wait to get his hands on this set, and keeps it displayed proudly on his desk near his computer.  He may want the other sets eventually, but this is the main one with the Steve character which he wanted first.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|WOW! Even Tom Cruise couldn't ruin this film  - and that's saying somethin'! (although I would have preferred a less controversial actor)<br />  CGI is NOT overdone. Story is COOL. Classic sci-fi with an 'Amazing Stories' Asimov-Bradbury feel. We need more like it!<br />  I see a lot of bad reviews. I think a lot of younger people fail to appreciate a good film when they see one. Could they have done more? Sure! But, just because anything IS possible on screen now, doesn't mean ya should. Over all, our culture is so overexposed to anything being visually possible on film, these days, that a simple story with well written twists is beyond many.<br />  Honestly, the original 'Twilight Zone' would probably never have made it beyond the first season today, if it got that far -- Not enough Glitz, action, junk and violence....sad.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had to re-read this book because I'm seeing the movie the day after it comes out!! It's a really good series
B00D48BT5A|1.0|It's a boring catalogue of research with no obvious point or thread.  There's hardly a smile in the whole book.  Come on Mr. Bryson you can still make me laugh surely?
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Gary Taubes uses historical, anecdotal, and medical evidence to show that we get fat from eating carbs.  Cutting back on--or cutting out--these carbs will cause us to lose weigh and lead healthier lives.<br /><br />I checked this book out from my local online library and read it over the weekend.  It was an interesting, eye-opening read for me, telling me that the reason I've gained 20 lbs in the 10 years since I've graduated high school is because I eat too many carbs.<br /><br />As a relatively young woman (28) I grew up with the FDA Food Pyramid telling me that I should eat lots of bread, rice, and starchy foods.  I asked my dad to read the book to provide a second, skeptical eye to what was totally new information to me.  He told me about when he was a young man in college going to gyms (before it was really popular), saying the bodybuilders told him the only difference between them and the weightlifters--who tend to be just as strong but fatter--was the amount of carbs they ate.  So it wasn't quite as ground-breaking for him.<br /><br />In the month or so since I read the book, I have cut back on the amount of carbs, mostly in the form of sugars and white flour, that I eat.  I've lost 6 pounds in the last month, going from 144 to 138, without changing my exercise habits.  My cravings for these unhealthy foods have gone down, and I have felt better and more energetic.  Cleaner somehow.<br /><br />Buy this book and take the information it contains to heart.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another awesome book. I loved it. I don't think John Grisham could write a bad book.  Only wish for more.
B00AA36RZY|4.0|Clear explanations. Helps to get a grip on the subject without being too complicated. I would recommend this book to anyone starting out with learning design patterns.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|An in depth account of not only the Bin Laden raid, but also the life of a SEAL. My favorite part of the narrative is that Owen doesn't present himself as some lone wolf hero. He consistently credits his team of fellow SEALs for their collective role in missions and acknowledges he is no different or better than the men he fought beside.
0689877692|5.0|It is a brilliant concept. I love 3-d books and I am very impressed with this one. What more can I say?
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|An amazing true story of war time life in the USA and Germany during WW II. It tells of the fear and bravery of pilots for both sides of the conflict and the honor of the non-nazi professional Air Force in Germany.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|beautifully written book in the same nature as A TIME TO KILL...been waiting for this one for years.  yes, I'm a Grisham fan, and it all started with his first book.  it was worth it to read his follow-up for it was just as replete with interesting, diverse, and very real characters as before...not to mention a grand plot!
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game is entertaining but could easily become expensive! I'm still trying to figure it out. Wish me some luck
B00170GXQ2|3.0|A typically overly-ambitious over-produced treatment of the Stoker classic by the wildly overrated Francis Ford Coppola.  It sticks a lot closer to the original novel than many other renditions and it looks gorgeous if \\"stagey\\".  (The \\"stagey\\" motif is one of Coppola's really irritating conceits.  Yes, Francis, I can dig, even without your \\"shadow commentary,\\" that I'm watching a mythic story narrative even as I suspend my disbelief to try to enjoy it.  Duh.)  The Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins performances are, per as usual, marvelous, while Keanu Reeves's performance is, per as usual, nonexistent.  Faux-actress Winona Ryder is achingly lovely to look at, but in that mega-cute eternal girl v. ethereally beautiful adult woman kind of way of hers, thus dreadfully miscast.  She turns the movie into a high school play every time she's on screen.  Her line readings bemoaning her \\"love that is damned\\" are unintentionally funny.  But she's just so darn gorgeous. (Sigh...) SPECIAL FUN:  For all you \\"Deep Dracula\\" fans like me:  You will note that Bram Stoker's creature was vile and hideous, conceived long before the advent of the \\"sexy/romantic\\" modern vampire. Coppola employs a wraparound story of the historic Vlad the Impaler and wife to give Dracula a tragic romantic character that was not in the novel.  He also gives Dracula a motivation for sailing to London other than simply to spread his evil outside Transylvania:  He sees a photo of Mina in Harker's locket and she is the obvious physical reincarnation of his long lost suicidal love.  Guess what?  Coppola lifted this totally cool plot device from \\"Dark Shadows\\" producer Dan Curtis's 1973 TV-movie version of \\"Dracula\\" starring Jack Palance (dollar-for-dollar, a far better written Vlad-informed story and movie than Coppola's; screenplay by the masterful Richard Matheson).  Dan Curtis, in turn, lifted this romantic vampire's suicidal lost love narrative from his own earlier \\"Dark Shadows\\" soap masterpiece (1966-71).It's the Barnabas Collins and Josette DuPres story resurrected. As it should be, forever and ever.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I always enjoy Gladwell's writing and books. I was learn something new and am exposed to new concepts & ideas!
B000IEXVCC|3.0|When this flick first went to DVD I tried to rent it at a Blockbuster in New Jersey.  Fuhgeddaboudit.  The minimum wage rack filler in charge that night refused to rent me the DVD.  He had even cleared all the copies from the racks and was holding them in the back room.  There was no way he was going to rent this -- by his assessment the worst movie ever made -- to me or anyone else in the Garden State.  He was actually angry about the film's existence.  Why?  He was adamant that there was absolutely no story to be had in the whole film.  The movie was just a jumble of disjointed and pointless images and vignettes meaning absolutely nothing.  The whole thing was obviously some sick Hollywood freak's practical joke on America -- stealing 2 hours from all our lives for a tossed garbage salad, 2 hours of precious life we would never get back.  In his opinion, director David Lynch should be prosecuted post haste.  The overwrought clerk finally agreed to let me have a copy at no charge.  If I could, upon the morrow upon returning the movie, relate to him any shred of story, plot or meaning in the mess, he would put the movie back out on the racks.  In the morning I told him:  It's a sardonic black-humored modern update of &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34; with Wendy being a wannabe actress in Hollywood.  A car accident on Mulholland is the &#34;tornado&#34; that kicks off her extended &#34;moment-before-death-by-suicide&#34; (the Ambrose Bierce &#34;Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&#34; construct) moment of her hallucinating the &#34;reasons&#34; for her not becoming the hottest new movie star in town.  The hallucinatory narrative goes back and forth between the true &#34;reality&#34; of her failure (she's a mediocrity, not particularly talented, special or connected) and her wounded &#34;alibi&#34;: She imagines she has been sabotaged by dark forces of both movie industry and possibly supernatural variety actively conspiring against her.  In a weird way, this movie is a far more&#34;realistic&#34; fictional documentary of how dreams are sucked to a dry desiccated death by the Hollywood machine than other more conventionally-told cautionary tales.  If viewed through this &#34;Alternative Oz&#34; lens, the movie is quite sad, fun and hypnotically watchable.  Well, the Blockbuster clerk would have none of my slick West Coast/L.A. explanation, so the DVDs stayed in the back room -- and New Jersey remained protected from Lynch's evil film assault on logic, rationality and American goodness.  Naomi Watts is wonderful in this by the way.  As she is in almost everything.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I am truly amazed at the number of excellent reviews for Grisham's new book. To compare Grisham to other writers may be unfair. But, read Thomas H. Cook, and you will see how to combine a good story with literate writing. Most of this book is filler. It takes nearly two thirds of the book to get to the heart of the story and trial. It's all plot, and could have been told in half the time. I was truly bored, skimmed pages, and got lost in the myriad of characters lawyers and subplots. I found myself just wanting to skip to the end, find out the twist ending, and get done with this boring book. I guess having a loyal fan base will get you rave reviews. Sorry, I would wait for the library copy. Three stars were generous. (Kindle edition)
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Sometimes you know that a story has changed you and will change the wake you yourself will leave in the world. This is such a story, such a book.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham seems to always deliver.  He knows how to tell a great story with well-defined characters.  I'm a fan!
B00CH3DBNQ|1.0|This  book was selected by our book club. We found some parts interesting but most of it overwhelmingly boring. Poorly written. Too much detail. Hard to follow and read because of  terminology.  Her struggle  is heroic. I got the impression that the publishers just wanted to get this book out  on the market while Malala was in the headlines and didn't ediit it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|At first, I wasn't sure what to expect, I mean book 1 was good, but this one was much better! loved every minute of it!<br /><br />I feel bad for both Eva and Gideon considering their pasts. It's hard to imagine how their relationship will work out, but you root for them anyway. You want them to overcome the odds.<br /><br />Ugh, Gideon, Gideon, Gideon. I feel for him, but also want to shake him. He's so stoic and refuses to let Eva in and can't see how it's pulling her down. I liked seeing them spend some time apart, and her try to become herself again.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next book and see how their relationship grows if it does or what happens.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This movie was the best show on Star Trek to come out in years. It answered all of the questions everyone had in years.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|this is a great language learning app that I totally recommend to anyone wanting to learn French, German, Spanish, Italian, or Portuguese.  It simple, effective,  accurate, and free.  also, its easy to use and it has an online website that you can check out before you download.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have seen in quite some time. It is riveting, it is well-placed and I love each of the characters. The season was excellent! I love Chris Noth and Juliana Marguiles. Together they are great. She plays Alicia perfectly.
B00FWPWNKS|3.0|This game is a lot of fun, but it freezes up after about 15 games.  I had to delete and download again, which starts the game from scratch.  If this problem could be resolved it would get 5 stars.<br /><br />Also, this is a great game to play while waiting for the Candy Crush Saga time lockout to expire.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this Candy Crush Game. I don't like some the hard levels but it's wonderfully exciting when you finally pass it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good weather app. Keeps you up to date with the latest watches and warnings. The radar feature is very handy also.
B008JFUS8M|5.0|After more than a year and a half, the seemingly endless wait has finally come to an end.  The Hunger Games sequel, Catching Fire, is here.  If anticipation could literally kill people, this film would have whipped out tens of millions - not dissimilar from a Harry Potter or Twilight sequel.  Regardless, the difference between The Hunger Games and Harry Potter or Twilight is the target audience of The Hunger Games is limitless.  While the first film nearly broke the $700 million barrier worldwide, this franchise has picked up so much momentum that there shouldn't be any stopping it, right?  Well, it's not like we aren't all aware of the dreaded \\"curse of the sequel,\\" but rest assured Hunger Games fans - there's nothing to fear here.<br /><br />The Hunger Games director, Gary Ross, steps aside for the sequel as the reigns fall on the shoulders of highly-acclaimed music video and occasional film director, Francis Lawrence (Water for Elephants, I Am Legend).  Catching Fire, based on the novel sequel of the same name by Suzanne Collins, picks up in the aftermath of the Hunger Games victory by Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson).  Back in District 12, the pair attempts to reclaim their lives of normalcy while still dealing with the emotional backlash of being forced to murder people for the benefit of entertaining a legion of disassociated onlookers.<br /><br />With the residents of the twelve districts becoming more and more agitated and on the verge of a revolution, President Snow places the blame on the actions of Katniss and her refusal to kill Peeta.  Snow instructs her to sell her sham of a love affair with Peeta in order to unite the people and threatens her family and friends if she continues to defy the Capitol - evident in a kiss she shares with her close friend, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth).  In the meantime, Katniss and Peeta go on tour to each district to pay tribute to their fallen Hunger Games opponents, including an emotional tribute to Rue - which only intensifies the rebellion.  Snow takes notice and sends in Peacekeeper soldiers to execute members of the forming resistance.<br /><br />As the violent acts of the Peacekeepers intensifies, so does Snow's intent to murder Katniss.  However, Snow's new adviser, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), hatches a plan to evoke the Third Quarter Quell on the 75th Anniversary of the Hunger Games.  Instead of drafting new competitors for this anniversary contest, the lottery includes only former Hunger Games victors from each district, including Katniss, and Peeta.  As the only female victor of District 12, Katniss must once again take arms in the Hunger Games, and is instantly forced to leave for the capitol - escorted by Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks).  On a side note, Banks' costumes are even more elaborately outlandish in this film than the last.  Still, just amazing costume designs all around.<br /><br />Let me first say that I don't read a whole lot of fiction (often spending my time watching it, instead), so the criticism coming from me are only in regards to the film itself.  With that being said, there's nearly nothing to criticize about this film anyway.  Honestly, after watching nearly half of this film, I was fully prepared to hammer this film for being nothing more than a slight reimaging of the first film.  After watching the first film prior to watching the sequel, both films progress almost verbatim.  The film begins with Katniss and Gale in the restricted zone hunting, followed by a slow progression of re-introducing characters from the previous film.  As the story goes on, you'll notice slight variations from scenes in the first film when she arrives to the Capitol.  Once more, Katniss and Peeta are paraded around (with combustible outfits), go through the interview process with Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), and begin the same old training process.  Only, instead of shooting an apple out of pig's mouth, Katniss is forced to be more creative (since this time they've installed a force field).<br /><br />There are plenty of new characters introduced as opponents in the Hunger Games, including Gloss (Alan Ritchson), Johanna Mason (Jena Malone), Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), Mags (Lynn Cohen), and the undeniably charming Claudius Templesmith (Toby Jones).  Initially, you're led to believe this will be just another round of one-on-one violence as in the first film - but it's not.  These games are so much more evolved and clever in comparison to the last film.  Obviously, the battle sequences are major spoilers, so there's no need to discuss them in too much detail here other than to say the actual Hunger Games themselves make this movie into an absolute pleasure to watch.  For the individual characters themselves, the other 23 competitors are not the prominent threat anymore.  This time around, the unpredictability of their environment will have you zoned into this flick to the extent that you'll feel like you're sitting right next to these characters and sharing their experiences with them as they occur.<br /><br />Obviously, some new characters have more screen time than others, but the screen time is largely devoted to Jennifer Lawrence and her emotional journey - a role in which Lawrence visibly excels.  This film starts out with her character still recovering from the traumatizing events of her Hunger Games experience.  From there, all the way to final moments of this sequel, Katniss is being slowly emotionally drained.  The climax of this film is momentary build-up of her character saying enough is enough.  She's surrounded by death and the idea that she's a symbol of hope (a theme is constantly mention over the course of the film), and frankly, that's bound to take its toll on anyone.  At the same time, she's half-heartedly being courted by two different male suitors, one of which is her close friend (Gale) and the other she's supposed to marry for the good of \\"the people.\\"  And, while this romantic triangle is mildly entertaining, I like the fact that it's not at the forefront.  To be honest, the chemistry between Lawrence, Hemsworth, and Hutcherson isn't all that believable in the first place.<br /><br />Overall, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a film that starts off slowly but eventually puts a stranglehold on your attention, making it one of the best sequels in recent memory.  For those worrying about it not living upto  the first film, rest assured:  the sequel is better than its predecessor.  You can't say that very often, yet in this case the sequel is far superior in nearly every facet of storytelling, acting, production, and design.  If I had to generate a guess, Catching Fire will impress moviegoers so much that it will land itself in a club with The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather II, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day as one of the best sequels ever made.  The thematic elements alone, discussing events that run rampant on the world today, including politics, revolution, media bias, wealth vs. poverty, and powerful people doing anything to maintain their power, all contribute to the success and progression of this story.  By now, you're likely aware the two part final chapter, Mockingjay Part 1 & 2, are on their way, and the final scenes of Catching Fire provide a cliffhanger that have already made Mockingjay one of the most anticipated sequels of both 2014 and 2015.<br /><br />Also, if you happen to listen to modern music, you should definitely check out the Catching Fire soundtrack.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />GRADE:  A-<br />FNDNreview.comf shooting an apple out of pig's mouth, Katniss is forced to be more creative (since this time they've installed a force field).<br /><br />There are plenty of new characters introduced as opponents in the Hunger Games, including Gloss (Alan Ritchson), Johanna Mason (Jena Malone), Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), Mags (Lynn Cohen), and the undeniably charming Claudius Templesmith (Toby Jones).  Initially, you're led to believe this will be just another round of one-on-one violence as in the first film - but it's not.  These games are so much more evolved and clever in comparison to the last film.  Obviously, the battle sequences are major spoilers, so there's no need to discuss them in too much detail here other than to say the actual Hunger Games themselves make this movie into an absolute pleasure to watch.  For the individual characters themselves, the other 23 competitors are not the prominent threat anymore.  This time around, the unpredictability of their environment will have you zoned into this flick to the extent that you'll feel like you're sitting right next to these characters and sharing their experiences with them as they occur.<br /><br />Obviously, some new characters have more screen time than others, but the screen time is largely devoted to Jennifer Lawrence and her emotional journey - a role in which Lawrence visibly excels.  This film starts out with her character still recovering from the traumatizing events of her Hunger Games experience.  From there, all the way to final moments of this sequel, Katniss is being slowly emotionally drained.  The climax of this film is momentary build-up of her character saying enough is enough.  She's surrounded by death and the idea that she's a symbol of hope (a theme is constantly mention over the course of the film), and frankly, that's bound to take its toll on anyone.  At the same time, she's half-heartedly being courted by two different male suitors, one of which is her close friend (Gale) and the other she's supposed to marry for the good of \\"the people.\\"  And, while this romantic triangle is mildly entertaining, I like the fact that it's not at the forefront.  To be honest, the chemistry between Lawrence, Hemsworth, and Hutcherson isn't all that believable in the first place.<br /><br />Overall, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a film that starts off slowly but eventually puts a stranglehold on your attention, making it one of the best sequels in recent memory.  For those worrying about it not living upto  the first film, rest assured:  the sequel is better than its predecessor.  You can't say that very often, yet in this case the sequel is far superior in nearly every facet of storytelling, acting, production, and design.  If I had to generate a guess, Catching Fire will impress moviegoers so much that it will land itself in a club with The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather II, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day as one of the best sequels ever made.  The thematic elements alone, discussing events that run rampant on the world today, including politics, revolution, media bias, wealth vs. poverty, and powerful people doing anything to maintain their power, all contribute to the success and progression of this story.  By now, you're likely aware the two part final chapter, Mockingjay Part 1 & 2, are on their way, and the final scenes of Catching Fire provide a cliffhanger that have already made Mockingjay one of the most anticipated sequels of both 2014 and 2015.<br /><br />Also, if you happen to listen to modern music, you should definitely check out the Catching Fire soundtrack.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was very surprised by the plot twists and yet the characters are still true to their personalities as developed in the previous books. Loved the Christian perspective at the end. Early what we expect of him and yet so revealing. Still hate to let Ana and Christian go. Sad to finish the series.
0810983915|5.0|Good book and great condition. My sons love these books, though some topics are disconcerting to parents... book quality was excellent.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show, I was pleasantly surprised and hooked very soon. The repartee and character development is very good. Its wonderful that all seasons are available on Amazon Prime.
1419705849|3.0|The book was printed in India with smaller font, less grade of paper and worse binding than the others books I bought for my son. Had I known that I wouldn't have chosen this item.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Glad Amazon got it sorted for the Kindle. Love these minions. Easy to play and great sounds just like the movies.
B00EY7MFKS|3.0|Agent Phil Coulson is the ONLY character who has any connection to the movie franchise. The series is yet to show even a single character from the Marvel Universe.<br /><br />It does look pretty good for a sci-fi series. The plot-line are of the slow-build-to-the-climax kind.<br /><br />But this show was shown to the public to strongly imply that Marvel characters would show up - which has been rather close to none of them.
B008V8FVTI|3.0|Kept my interest but too dark to see again. Good acting but a bit of a downer.  Not a feel good movie.
1400095204|5.0|I had the privilege of reading this book for my history course at UTSA called Occupation, Revolution and Nation in Africa. While this book was a requirement for the class I enjoyed the book and plan on reading more of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's work. As a whole this work is one that needs to be read by anyone who is studying the Biafra secession and resulting civil war in Nigeria. The greatest strength of this book is that even though it is a historical fiction, the novel is able to portray the story in a manner that gives the reader a view into what it was like for Biafrans during the civil war. In fact I believe this book can offer a reader much more than a historical book can offer. While historical books simply go over general facts and generalizations of the time period or event, Adichie is able to push past the generalizations and tell the reader about specific individual stories. On top of Adiche's individualization she is able to show a variety of people's experience of the Nigerian civil war. She is able to tell the experiences of characters from a child to an adult, which allows the reader to see the Nigerian civil war through different lenses. I would encourage everyone to read this book who wants more insight on the experience of a Biafran before, during and after the Nigerian civil war.
B0060D15AK|5.0|This is the kind of movie you can watch time and time again.  Funny! Great actors! Love story and beautiful scenery!
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I love, love, love Daniel Craig as 007.  This has everything you want from a Bond movie, action, intrigue, beautiful scenery, etc.  the only regret...oh, oh spoiler!  I can't tell my only regret!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Poignant, sad, yet almost funny at times. Tells the love story of two teens with cancer, the friends in their support group, and the heroine's quest to find an answer to a cryptic ending in a book by a reclusive Dutch author. Recommended to me by my 18 yr old granddaughter, but not totally a &#34;young adult&#34; novel. It sheds light on how people react differently when faced with their mortality-young or old.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Another masterpiece! Smooth, inviting melodies with the usual cryptic, intriguing lyrics. Brilliant musicianship and arrangements with a crisp, well engineered mix.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Couldn't have built my book without it! Very easy to follow and made the job much easier. So thank you.
140006922X|5.0|A much more realistic story of who Jesus probably was. I found the writing style top notch. A good read along with Paul and Jesus to help one understand how Christianity ending up surviving.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It's a enjoyable movie and it's done in such a way that you can figure out the set-ups for the heists if you apply yourself to it. The ending is definitely a little weak, but all in all it's definitely fun to watch.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved this book...great sequels are not easy to write but Mr. Grisham did it!! I highly recommend this book.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Love it love it. I have not actually taken a picture but the features are fabulous. I just hope it saves my pictures. The HD app I had installed previously did not save anything. I was upset. I had taken photos of my Mom's birthday party. She was turning eighty. I know this camera will be better.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A great game to unwind after work on the train - addictive as all such games are - but not so involved you can't dip in and out at leisure.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Insightful, credible, and useful.  Gladwell provides a useful illustrations and commentary that highlights how size, strength, and market domination can often become key vulnerabilities that, under the right circumstances and with the appropriate knowledge, enable the smaller, less powerful and commanding, to become victorious and achieve power and dramatic success.  Well worth a read.

He objects to a non-celiac person pursuing a gluten free diet, on grounds that it could be expensive.  Eliminating gluten does not have to mean you spend more over all.  Isn't feeling better, and being more fit, the goal?  A sidewise look in the mirror will tell you if you should buy this book.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I am unhappy with the lack of control over who gets to see my information and how difficult they make it to keep my privacy.
B001WCN232|5.0|Not all music is for dancing. This one is for those of us who were altered chemically at the time that this album came out and it spoke to the times and what we were experiencing. For that reason it imprinted a very memorable experience and for<br />that reason it is my Favorite Stones album. That may make this obscure or uninteresting to some but it was weird times<br />and this is weirded out music to reminisce by. Black light rooms full of incense and other smoke. Moody contemplative<br />songs make up half or more of this one. It can take you to more rare place that was cool in the 1970's. It's all subjective<br />anyway but this is A Great Rolling Stones Record, Their Best. They wrote Silver Train for Johnny Winter, It Rocks!<br />Hear Johnny's version also.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|It is a very well acted movie with great actors.  I received the dvd  very quickly.<br />Good family movie to watch.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Anyone who has endured physical and emotional pain will appreciate this journey. Especially if you have ever done any serious hiking.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Probably one of the best Grisham books he has written in many years. And, that is saying a lot as Grisham has written many good books in his career. However,  in order to fully understand the history of how the people for Ford County felt towards Jake Brigance (main lawyer) I would suggest that one reads 'A Time to Kill&#34; before reading Sycamore Row. I promise you will not regret it. &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; is Grisham's best novel and was also made into a great movie in my opinion. Anyway, I suggest this book to anyone that likes to see justice prevail.

B009CG1F1G|5.0|We love Coraline in our house. My son who is 19 months old LOVES it and watches it on the daily. He does not watch regular cartoons. He does like clay animation and realistic costumed characters such as yo gabba gabba and Barney and this movie takes the top rank for him as he does not take his eyes off the tv while watching it. The story line is clever cute yet creepy at the same time. Very creative WE LOVE IT!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great read!!  It was a little predictable but I still enjoyed how the author peeled away layers of the characters and plot.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The commercial leads you to believe that you just click in a thumb-drive-sized device (as in the picture) and that's it.  BUT, Chromecast requires that you plug it into either a USB port or wall outlet for it to function properly.  This removes one of the most convenient aspects that you are lead to believe in the commercials.  If your TV doesn't have a USB port, or there isn't a nearby wall outlet, then you will not be able to use this product effectively.

1400095204|5.0|Efiom Edem AAS 4013 Gonzales<br /><br />Chimamanda Adiche's book &#34;Half of a Yellow Sun is a very deep look into what occurred during the Nigeria/Biafra War as well as a very engaging view into the lives ofthe people involved in the story. What I liked the most about this book is that it was a history lesson as well as a human narrative when looking into the lives of Ugwu, Olanna, Kainene and others. The moment I started reading it I was immediately engaged, partly because I myself am Nigerian and didn't know these events took place and once it was brought to my attention I could not turn away. Another part that I found interesting was the various perspectives Chimamanda Adiche brought to the table, I believe it helped me look at the whole situation more objectively. This book is a very compelling read and I recommend it to many people
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Because it's a lot of fun but can sometimes be very hard when you get in to the higher levels
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I don't mind the ending, but at the same time it fell flat for me. Mostly, I just didn't care for the style of writing. I found myself skimming through a lot of it because I felt like the author dragged out too many of the storylines, e.g. The drama between Tris and Tobias.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy to use cross-platform.  I update on my laptop and sync across my Android phone and Kindle.  Recently, I asked my team to download it as well and it is being used to manage daily activities and responsibilities.
B007V65R54|4.0|Starts off pretty dry, but gets to some great analysis of baseball and weather and gambling. Not a breezy read but worth the time.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Couldn't believe how this book ended ... very disappointing.  It was hard to keep up with author changing back and forth between characters in every chapter ... just pick one!!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Duolingo is by far the best free language software I've seen. I've been using it for a month and I keep coming back. I think I may read better than I speak but I've done other lessons and these are the most engaging. This alone will not make me fluent but is a fun way to get started or to practice some rusty skills.  And I love that my phone, computer and kindle sync.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Even though the book is brief (at least the author didn't fill it with fluff just to lengthen it), it hit home for me. I felt understood as I read it and resonate with the material. I have used the advice in it to great advantage.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Been a while since a book this good came around. Puts lots of thoughts in your mine. I wonder how it is that we cant people to work things out the way this book does.

068485743X|4.0|Very good tips for aspiring writers. Little things that improve the quality of the story. A must for beginning writers.
031603438X|5.0|Never was interested in him, but this book made me a fan. Very well written a romping great tale of our times told with panache and brutal honesty. Can't wait for the movie, Johnny Depp must play! The scene of his son playing on his skateboard inside a sprawling, neglected mansion, with frost and ice inside because no one is looking after it, is haunting.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun but don't like to wait so long for lives....makes the game a drag...also why should you have buy something in every game to advance quicker....
030758836X|4.0|One of the best books I have read in a long LONG time!<br /><br />Without giving it away- this book was amazing. There is a huge plot twist that completely changes your mind on what is going on and I did not see it coming. I agree with some other reviewers that the ending couldn't have been a little better, but I honestly love this book and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a &#34;attention-grabbing&#34; book! I could not put it down!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Master story telling by George here. I have to say that I'm fully immersed in the SOIAF story. This was certainly an improvement from Feast in terms of tempo, although I'll say that I enjoyed Feast as well. The 10 years it took to get to the stories/POVs we loved was a bit of a drag, and the story did not progress as much as I had hoped that it would, but overall this is an excellent fantasy series. Easily among the top five fantasy series of all time.

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is the movie that made me buy a 3D television and glasses for the family. It's like you're in a hobbit hole. It's like you're there. Very warm feeling movie with a lot of fun, adventure and style. Fun to share one of my favorite stories with my kids/wife although I can't wait to read the book to my son when he's a few years older, and it looks sharp as possible on bluray too, I might add. Great movie, great product.
B004YW4L5K|2.0|The opening of this book is compelling, but if you think the story is really going to follow that theme in a straight line, you will be wrong, as I was. Seems to me like the  book blurb is misleading.<br /><br />I know Gaiman has magical elements in his books and I loved that in THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE, but I did not love this book.This book was too fantasy/myth for my tastes. Although I understand and even agree with the parallels Gaiman was making to today's world, there were too many threads/characters and the main character seemed so passive for so much of the book.<br /><br />If you love analyzing deep themes, you might love this book, but if you want to read a story based upon what the teaser promises, you may be disappointed.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|Too much like Thor! Typical American, modern movie designed for action and thrills! My wife and I felt the older Superman movies were better. This one left us disappointed. Made for young juveniles.

B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this and recommend everyone to read. It gives different perspective at looking at traditional learning methods or systems we have. One size fits all system may not work for everyone and if they can find the right learning environment and places where they apply their skills, they can be very successful. Thanks Gladwell for your awesome work.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Highly overrated. Much of it was expected.  Have no idea why everyone else loved it so much, so I was quite disappointed.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was disappointed in the ending... it felt like the author just got tired of writting and skipped the ending and jumped to the epilogue.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|The film is a mess. Constant action, explosions and no character development.  A film designed for short attention spans. It doesn't have any of the heart of the original.
B00DBISUWS|4.0|I read press reviews that this album would revisit the production style of her early work. I gave it a listen through starting with Jo. It didn't take too long for the track to pull me in with the shimmering synth pads, samples being played in reverse and chorusing effects. These were things reminiscent of Felt Mountain that charmed me. Then the acoustic elements were introduced fitting very well (upright bass and strings)and the somber mood had been set. And, last but not least, her hypnotizing voice and lyrical style just put the topping on the cake. YES! Goldfrapp is back! The rest of the album I noticed, aside from Thea, was more minimally produced. The mixes of many of her albums (excluding Seventh Tree) are more busy and almost take you into a different space. This album definitely maintains the melancholy genius of Felt Mountain, without the production bells and whistles(she actually does whistle on Felt Mountain, but no pun was intended).<br /><br />These however are things that we can get over because the album is still produced well, just minimally processed. Being one for interesting mixes and untraditional mixing techniques, I can give this album 4 stars because I believe it falls just a little short of my production preferences that I'm used to in her work.

0440246008|5.0|Jack Reacher is a great character.  Lee Child develops the suspense to a &#34;on the edge of the chair, can't put the book down&#34; level.  Just don't let Tom Cruise get in there again.  He's no Jack Reacher!

0399157573|2.0|I haven't read this one yet, and may not. I'm afraid I agree with many of the reviewers about P.C.'s recent books. She seems to have deteriorated badly. Her bad attitude toward Marino was always offensive (fat = stupid, gross, full of bad habits, rude, sloppy, etc). But nowadays it seems to extend to so many more &#34;inferior&#34; people.

B00BUL3X1G|5.0|A perfect gem of a perfect movie. In a 1959 setting that exists in faery tale beauty the world is nuts for speed typists, and this is kind of like a beautiful female ROCKY meets speed typing. This film could qualify as a romantic comedy, but it's one of the best all-around films I've ever seen. In French with excellent subtitles, comedy, romance, suspense, and---yes---the all-important &#34;lump in the throat&#34; and tears in the eyes!<br /><br />Fantastic screenplay, plot, pacing, twists, production, casting, acting, &#34;chemistry,&#34; humor, direction, and filming---all you could ask for :)<br /><br />In a sea of horrid films, pompous and affectatious actors, this work renews my faith in the romantic comedy and film in general. Don't hold out; see it!<br />.

B00BEIYN3M|5.0|I haven't laughed so hard at a movie consistently from start to finish in ages. This was by far the funniest movie of the year, if not the the last five years. Everyone brought their A game. Yeah, it can get \\"raunchy\\" at times, as some reviewers have said, but it's an R Rated comedy, NOT PG.. It's a story about drug smugglers.. People need to get real.. If you want wholesome, go rent the Apple Dumpling Gang... I saw this on another movie service, but just ordered the extended blu ray with Ultraviolet.<br /><br />The only thing that is disappointing is that Amazon does not yet support Ultraviolet.. I have over 1,100 UV titles. it's the future of movie owning and watching. I can view my collection on thousands of apps and platforms. Most major retailers support UV (Walmart, Target, Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, etc..) and I can watch my library on any of their streaming platforms because UV movies are mirrored and free to access and watch... Even a major cable provider is set to accept UV. Amazon video titles..aren't..So I don't get why listings advertise UV on Amazon, but yet they won't support it's functionality... I Hope this changes very soon.. Great movie though!

For example, this one time, Temple Run 2 had a limited-time character, Usain Bolt. Just one thing-he costed 99¢. You can get a limited time character, and more, for no real money, just you have to pay about 90,000 coins in the game, which is not real money. Temple Run games, also, you have to move your kindle, and its hard to play in a moving vehicle. This results in much easier playing-except one thing. You can pay $5 in real money to get double coins, which you don't have to in Temple Run games!!! 4-stars only until this is changed.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Best puzzle out there.  Lets you spin pieces, break out the borders...Luv It!!!  Daily puzzles are a mystery but so much fun and helps relax you from a stressful day.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Very enjoyable and fun. I play many times a day. While not exactly like the Facebook version it's nice to not have to refresh all the time to play
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|If you are a solitaire fan this is the one for you.  Take the beginners run and you will start to find that the more levels you complete the more challenging the game gets.  You don't have to ever purchase anything because you can build points to do so.  You also get a free new game everyday.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|I bought this book a long while ago but it sat near the bottom of my queue for months while I pored through countless obscure mysteries, romances, scifi romps, thrillers. it sat there, taunting me with the faint sanctimonious air of brussels sprouts or broccoli: it stank of &#34;litrachure&#34; and rebuked me for neglecting it.<br /><br />but after I had exhausted every excuse and, finally, actually sat down to READ the darn thing, it turns out I couldn't have been more wrong. this wasn't boring vegetables. this was candy-coated, barbequeued red meat, spicy and rich and flavorful. I couldn't read it fast enough. I blew off getting to work on time in the morning to read just a few more pages. I stayed up late, until my eyes couldn't be propped up with toothpicks any more. why did I ever hesitate to start it? why did I think it would be (yuck) &#34;good for me&#34;?<br /><br />this book is freaking great. it doesn't need my rambling faint praise. but I felt I had to add it anyway.<br /><br />go now; buy it if you haven't bought it already. and read it if you have.<br /><br />what a wild ride.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing. If you read the first two books, there is no question that you want to buy this one. You have to finish the series! So good!
B00DTOZD4C|5.0|Quirky, off-the-wall, improbable and absurd, this is still a fun read. Set partially in Sweden by a Swedish author, it takes the reader on a quick review of much of 20th century history. At the same time, the reader must absolutely suspend all belief that these events could even possibly have happened, and that makes the story even funnier. The story [and therefore the author] is clever ... elements are introduced early in the story that turn out much later in the text to be critical in understanding how the ornery centenarian hero gets out of still another scrape. If there's any deep meaning to this novel, I missed it, but it certainly is a fun read! The author reveals a great deal of historical research went into the writing of this farce; if this book doesn't make you smile, someone should call the mortician.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Reading this book i could perfectly imagine how difficult and fascinating it must have been be to be involved with an intense Steve. The great thing is that you don't have to, with the book you could learn about Steve and Apple's ideological perspective, business management, life, and maybe more...
B0025UHKNS|2.0|We've tried and tried, and simply find this too complicated to use. I suspect that if it were used daily by someone doing serious training it might be useful. It is too complex for a casual walker/jogger.<br /><br />I am updating this review in June of 2016 to that we threw this unit in the trash. Not even not technically savvy friends could get this to work. I wouldn't advise buying one of the Fitbit products of which I own a Fitbit Charge. It does everything this Garmin didn't do, Fitbit does everything  and it's easy to use.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a fun read.  I have to admit that after Malcolm was released from prison on Rule 35 I couldn't figure out what he was planning or why.  Enjoyed the ending where it was revealed that he and Quinn were actually friends.  As I said it was a fun read and enjoyable.
1932100660|5.0|Hard not to admire the science that underlies this rather wonderful book. Makes the case for a plant-based diet by offering the searchable results of numerous scientific studies. An easy read for this layperson, and quite convincing.
0446343129|3.0|This is a good book, but it is somewhat dated since it was written so long ago.  It takes awhile to get to the meat of the sugar issue, he is telling a lot about his life leading up to the issue with sugar.
0812983459|1.0|Old man Harold receives letter from long lost friend when she's dying.  Instead of mailing her a letter he decides to walk across England to see her, hoping she'll stay alive and wait for him.  Intriguing premise, but the book falls flat.  Trite, inconsequential, incomprehensible.  Why does he leave wife and home?  Characters are all one-dimensional cardboard. .<br /><br />As if trying to rescue a watery soup with pepper, she inserts tell-all-memoir passages about Harold’s miserable life and failure as a father, etc., which are totally irrelevant as presented, and do nothing to enhance the weak story or deepen the reader's interest.  At the end she writes the most horrifying grotesque description of the dying friend.  It is revolting and totally pointless.<br /><br />Someone did an excellent job of marketing this claptrap to book groups, which guarantees sales..
006202406X|1.0|Really bad ending. Was very disappointed in the entire plot. Characters became boring.You don't just kill off someone for the shock value. Seemed senseless. There didn't seem to be much resolution for those who survived. Until this last book, I couldn't put the books down.  Can't believe a writer would disappoint fans like that.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first two books were great.  The last one....awful.<br /><br />While every other chapter was supposed to be in a different voice between Tobias and Tris, they all sounded alike, and more than once I had to back up and look at the first page of the chapter to recall who's viewpoint was supposed to be reading.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />And killing off Tris?  What a horrible and senseless ending.  It wasn't noble, didn't improve the story and served no purpose.  That made me regret the whole series.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I simply love this movie.  If you like Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie you will like this movie.  I know…the reviews weren't great, but who listens to reviews anyway.  I could watch this movie over and over.  Enjoy!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Loved the series.... I understand why the ending was chosen, but I really hoped for a different outcome. Can't wait for the movies
B003HV5WMK|5.0|Rollicking good fun, what? Beautiful Technicolor, Errol laughing with arms akimbo, Merry Men in Sherwood Forest! One of the greats. Absolute bliss.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the books.  Can't wait for the movie to come out.  Hope to see more from this author in the future
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It was ok but not even close to his other books.  This is well written as all his books are but is predictable
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I haven't found that this game is a fast moving game. It does however provide something to do to keep me busy.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|A much better that the reviews would lead one to believe. If you are philosophically inclined, you will enjoy this movie. Without repeating statements from other reviewers, I would add that the characters and concepts were quite plausible without coming across as hokey.
B006BXT4TI|5.0|Great recordings by a great band...wish there were more &#34;black keys&#34; like bands around with the talent and love for producing music with this kind of power and emotion behind it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.I have read them three Times in two years.Each  time tacking something different from them.I really hope you follow up on Christian and Ana.For I fill that their is more story to be told
B008ER9QLK|5.0|This is a landmark production of The Ring that stays true to the magical story! The production, singing and staging are all good! The conducting is fine and the orchestra is superior!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Extremely articulate...and says all there is to know for seekers on there way home to source and an intimate relationship with their soul while on this side of the veil.
B0000714BP|5.0|This is such a cool movie.  I'd never heard of it B-4 my daughter told me about it several years ago.  It has become one of our favorite movies to watch together.
B0012BQ60O|3.0|This item wasn't packaged properly. The sword was bent. I have tried to bend it back, but it is not where it would be if it were packaged  correctly.
1400069289|4.0|This was possibly the most practical book that I've read on the topic. A fascinating read for anyone trying to be more aware of their own human nature.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played but PC version is probably the best one probably is the best one! It's one of my Fav-Iorite ever it's really good.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Good game but you can't get the better guns without money. Aiming is easy and the controls are good. The history lessons are interesting also.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|It is very entertaining and beautiful music! My parents and brother are a little annoyed that i sit there playing Old French Song all night but.... what can  i say? I LOVE IT!
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|I'm not a crier. I don't cry. At all. I even dislike Nicholas Sparks romance novels. But I bawled at the end of Dear John. In bed. On a night where I probably should have been sleeping, but I couldn't put the book down. I mean, wow. Unconditional love can turn out well, but sometimes, it's just the opposite. And that's what makes this novel so intriguing.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Jo Nesbo's best book I've read so far. None of the phantom prince here. Straight up good read. If you like Harry Hole detective novels, you'll love this one.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have used a few different keyboards over the years and I have not found any better than SwiftKey. Does not work as well on my tablet but I am satisfied with the stock keyboard.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|First of all, it is the Word of God and because it has so many versions in one place.  It is invaluable.
B00FHATBGW|2.0|I do not like games that are gory. There is the hotel desk clerk and later he gets killed and there are bloody handprints and blood showing where the body gets dragged. Once you get to the body it is more blood and that is just one body. It really got to me so I never finished the free play. I deleted the game. This may be for some of you but not for me.
B0017APQ1K|5.0|Awesome Movie. Even comes with an exchangable spanish/english box wrap. Martin Scorcese once again does not dissapoint with this classic
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|This was a Good Story, I think they took there time and Did a wonderful Job of Directing and Performing in this Movie!
B004IFYMYI|5.0|WOW this movie is amazing. I never saw the original on vhs or dvd, but it definitely looks extremely sharp on blu ray. Great story telling. Martin Scorcese never dissapoints.
B00E9ZATTY|5.0|This is a great sequel to the original Monsters, Inc. - which is still one of our favorites!  The grandkids love it!
B000002KBU|5.0|Have listened to Joni since the 71 and love her, saw her once when she was touring. This I feel is her best work. Had the LP but it was stolen.
B00G4SS24I|4.0|cool album. not bad. I don 't like 99% of newer pop music....for some reason though, I like her voice...6.99- Do it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|The layout and choices are wonderful.<br />Some of the other puzzle apps I've used are frustrating because the movements are not as secure as they 're with Magic Jigsaw.<br />The selection of subjects are very impressive and can keep you busy for hours.<br />Thank you XIMAD INC<br /><br />Fraujeni43
B003G4W49C|4.0|Weird but engaging. Card 's writing is very unique. I am finishing the series but I have to read something in between.
B007PKDW44|5.0|Excellent album. Their sound is very unique. Sometimes hard to understand, but very cool. No one seems to know about these guys, but they need this in their collection.
1594489505|5.0|I am a huge fan of all of Hosseini's books. This one was my absolute favorite. It helped me learn so much about the culture in the middle east, that I would never learn from the news, it gave me a respect for a world that us Americans have no idea what it is like.
B0035YDM4Y|5.0|An incredible group of brave and disciplined humans. They certainly stand out as determined and way above the rest of mankind, in achievements and caring for their fellow team members. A very real and absorbing story, which is  unbelievably happening as we go about our daily lives. The author creates his story as if you are present and included in the events.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|one of the sweetest most poignant love stories on film.  for big and little kids (&  their parents)  alike.  Keeps you smiling,  laughing, and rooting for this underdog all movie long.
1579128149|5.0|Ok, Elements.  Need I say more?  I have a 12 year old who baffles me with his intelligence and yearning for information. He bought this book and read it out lout to me all the time (he found it that interesting) He also would bring it to Grandma's house and read it to her.  It is full of humor and well written.  Any person interested in science needs this book.
B00006F1IJ|5.0|Very good music!!! Its a nice CD to listen to while driving on long trips or just relax to at home
0553208845|2.0|This is not a true story. DO not take it as Buddhism. The story is fictional and creative but confuses facts. Prince Siddhartha is in fact the Buddha, also known as Buddha Shakyamuni, or the sage-liberated one of the Shakya people, who is Prince Saddartha (sid-dart-ta). This Siddhartha in this book is a fictional character.
B0000714B5|1.0|This needs to be clear. This is soly fiction, as well as is the book and is not the teachings of Buddha. Siddhartha The Guatama Buddha is the current known Buddha who teaches the dharma as we have it today. The writer inflicts conflicted information that is not Buddhism. Prince Siddhartha became the Siddhārtha Gautama, the buddha as we know today. Known to some as Buddha Shakyamuni, which means sage/enlightened one of the Shakya. which he was the prince. DO NOT TAKE THIS AS ACCURATE BUDDHISM because it is not.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Great movie and an icon in its time.  Not for everyone, but I love it. This is a must see!!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I feel bad writing this, but if you put your books out there like this I think it is fair to review them on a standard, professional author scale. This isn't that. It is clearly the work of a teen: the story is immature, and the language is weak.<br /><br />I applaud the ambition, but you should work on developing your skills before publishing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't get over how close the movie followed this book. I never watch the movie first,because the book is always better. I loved reading this and having a face for all the characters. Enjoyed this very much.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Do your cleaning and space managing from one place. Clean junk, free memory and auto-move downloaded apps to SD. Excellent!
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|Boring and beyond silly this is a remake not remotely interesting. Thank God above it was not costing me extra to watch it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Sister loved the game, so thought I would try it. I absolutely love this game it is very fun..... great game
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Awesome movie!!!! If only our president was like that!!! A lot of action in this movie..nonstop!! All great actors and acting
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book was excellent! Scary too! It kept me hooked I could not put it down! Best book by Stephen King in a long time!
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful album.  I love her voice.  This is good as is Love Club.  Buy them both!  She is a great young talent.
B00FDMNR6O|4.0|I like it but only 2 of the songs I really like, it's kind of too club like for me
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This games is so cool I really love it if your an animal lover this game is the one for you
B00G32OER4|2.0|Too predictable, not terribly coherent, some eerie moments but nothing I hadn't really seen before.  I finished it but would rate it average
0739370642|5.0|Great story and well written - a very enjoyable read for sure.  It keeps you flipping the pages easily and the characters are so different and interesting.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|Elton John Hasn't done an album this good for 20+ years!<br />The songs are excellent, and his performance is enhanced by NOT being over-produced.<br />All of the arrangements are the way they SHOULD be; thanks, Elton, for re-finding yourself.<br />If you may have drifted away from Elton, you MUST hear (and buy) this album!
B000002OX7|5.0|Tommy and Quadrophenia are great albums. But nothing matches Who's Next. \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" is incredible as a complex and tightly structured song that is at the same time ripping with spontaneity. Easily one of the best songs in rock music. Every song on the album is good ... \\"Bargain\\", \\"The Song is Over\\", \\"Love Ain't for Keeping\\" ... The added alternate verion of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" has some slick guitar accents that are a nice variation on the original, which is also included. The extras -- \\"Pure and Easy\\", \\"Baby Don't You Do It\\", \\"Naked Eye\\", and \\"Water\\" -- are songs that no Who fan should miss.
0385470819|1.0|Just couldn't get into it. I liked other John Grisham books so I thought I'd go back to the beginning. The beginning if the book just didn't flow for me so I gave up.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|so far, so good.<br />The download and install was quick and smooth. :-)<br />The 1st cleaning went smoothly too.<br />:-)
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Great movie for the kids. Adam Sandler and cast are quite funny. Good overall plot and the storyline is believable, other than the fact they are vampires. Kid friendly with no violence.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This was a great addition to my Instant Video collection.<br /><br />I pay attention to detail... the sets, costumes, special effects and acting are all so much fun that this a Star Trek movie worth watching many times.
B002XXUWMI|4.0|Clever and lively sci-fi, not entirely original and slightly overstays its welcome. Performances and effects are quite good, but the basic premise is a little too tricky for its own good.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an amazing read for all ages. It lets you truly understand the life of imperfect people. It has many parts that are emotional, funny, and friendship.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Very nice utility.  I started with the free version and decided to upgrade to the pro version because I find it so useful. The only bug I have found in the pro and free versions is that the export data via .csv file email attachment doesn't work.  It fails with a &#34;..email app unable to add attachment&#34; error.<br /><br />Also, it would be nice if the deletion of accumulated data had an option to allow saving some of the data.  Right now you can only delete all of it.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|One of the biggest sets made and my son loves it.  It was a long wait to get it but it was not disappointing. The set took 3 days to finish building.  Your child will love this.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I don`t usually like alien movies because of all of the fake weapons and other crap in them. But this movie has our soldiers fighting with the weapons that are in use today, not some fake laser rifles or anything else.<br /><br />This is a good movie.
B00EIMJVOM|5.0|Jessie J is amazing, she can sing and she actually tries to make songs with a meaning. She is so underrated, i think Thunder could give her another hit, Wild is great too. The bonus tracks are flawless (Hero and Magnetic). Buy this one if you enjoy pop music made by talented artists.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Another great action movie worth buying and watching with a lot of great actors in it. it one moving worth buying.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is one of Kings best novels to date. Even tho there's a time gap between the shinning and doctor sleep, it picks up right where you want it to. King doesn't miss a beat with details and blows your mind away with what happens to Danny. I would recommend this book to all Stephen King fans and just about anyone looking for a good read. I hope this one gets turned into a movie, as long as it follows the book to a T.
B00E8S2GJI|4.0|I would have given this four stars but for one thing. The Hobbit 3D multi-disk set DOESN'T include the DVD version. For the price paid for a 3D disk set, I would like to see the DVD included (as it is in many other 3D packs). Personally, the UltraViolet disk is worthless to me and it expires at some given date anyway. I would much rather see the full non-expirable (3D BD + BD + DVD) set and scrap the UV copy disk.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun game for the kids to complete quests and earn rewards. Quests are easy for them to complete. Cute graphics.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is the first book by Lee Child I have read.  The writing is literate, the characters are three dimensional, the plot held my attention.  It would get a place on my shelves if I had bought a physical book, as it is, I'll keep it on my kindle for rereading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this!! I always loved despicable me,  and now and app for it!! awesome! ALTHOUGH sometimes it crashes. but over all I live it nice job gameloft!!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|BEST GAME! Very fun and very entertaining and great story line! Can't wait for the fifth! Love love love love love this game! You should really download it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it! lnstead of having to tilt your device back and forth you just use your finger. I am 11 and my 5 year old sister can play the app by herself.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Excellent 3rd. Daniel Craig as Bond. Casino Royale is my favorite. Quantum of Solace not so much. Skyfall is the key to Bond's elusive upbringing. Well worth the watch!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Absolutely worth the read. I was skeptical going into it but was quickly rolling around laughing so hard and enjoying every page.
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|Nothing personal, Hexlogic, logic games just really aren't my bag. I like a challenge, but not tedium. Tedium is frustrationg
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addicting...can't wait until the next level...every level is more fun than the next...and get more exciting
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Great book but the movie was disappointing. Music and  many scenes not time appropriate, not well written or directed. Overall I didn't  care much for the movie.
157421327X|4.0|I still haven't used the book yet but I love the designs in it. I have several of the Zentangle books and find them fascinating. I've never been a &#34;doodler&#34; but hope these books will help me overcome that.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Oh oh oh has our family been IMMERSED in this Blu-Ray set! And we paid more, if only we'd waited for this pre-Black Friday deal! This is ALL OF IT, all of the 3 seasons of the original in glorious beauty in Blu-Ray format! Great sound by the way on our home theater system. Brings back SO many memories!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This is the best youtube app hands down.  That said,  it sometimes gets confused when I view a video and press the back arrow.  It would also be nice to queue up videos to be downloaded later when wifi is available.  It has a wifi only mode,  but that fails the download instead of postponing it. Lastly, it would be great to be able to quickly pick several videos to queue for download,  rather than having to open each one,  pick a resolution,  then go back to the list.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This is THE gluten-related book! If you are new to the whole gluten allergy thingy, this is the FIRST place to begin. In spite of the press, certainly not everybody is allergic to gluten but enough react to it, especially the GMO-pesticide-injected wheat and grains most of us consume today, that you owe it to yourself and especially your family to learn about this problem that wasn't even diagnosed until just a few years ago.<br /><br />Dr. Davis writes in a non-doctor way, making things very easy to understand.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|The depth and beauty of this movie far surpass anything I have the ability to describe to you. I hope you watch it.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Great songs from one of my favorite performers. Listen on my way home from work to clear my head. soothng and easy to sing along to.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome me and my friends can't get off it. If you hadn't got the game you need to get it. :)
B00FHATBGW|5.0|This is another great game for Big Fish.  I love the storyline and graphics!! Can't wait for the sequel! The hint button recharges quickly and never misguided you. The mini games are a little challenging but creative for the most part. I recommend anyone thinking of getting this game should do it. Definitely worth the money. It's also not short like the others either.
B00FHATBGW|3.0|It was ok, but had some trouble with it. Like Hidden Object games but the free ones that come to my Kindle don't work so well. Maybe it's me?
B0038M2AZA|5.0|It's a really inspiring story about a woman who is autistic and ended up helping society enormously.  My autistic son and I watched it.  When Temple comes back to town I'll bring him with.  She is his hero.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This was probably the best book I read this year and that's saying a lot.  Clinical but wrapped personal stories, what really brought the book to life was Cain's great writing style.  It is a deep look at an intriguing subject, with an eye towards understanding our traits and creating a better life; Cain represents us introverts well!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|As usual Grisham writes a great story that is hard fl me to put down.  I hope this book will be made into a movie.  Don't miss reading this book.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I've connected the Chromecast to my TV and It says it's connected but nothing shows up on my TV. Need help!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This plays as good as version on Facebook.  Fun and not too cutesy.  So far I love it its great I can take it with me<br /><br />Birdladysawyer
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Game is great move button is tricky but once u get it down no problem. Bosses are easy as of now, the graphics are very good, the rewards are pretty good over all this game is a good purchase
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Well, if it's a book about an animal being rescued, I'm going to be very happy! This was a very interesting story about James Bowen and his cat, Bob. I was captivated by the whole story.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Does what it's supposed to, most of the time. I use it for streaming flash videos to my TV. It works pretty well, however it has one glaring flaw. It only supports 2.4ghz 802.11n. I live in a condo and the 2.4ghz saturation is insane. Sometimes, I simply cannot use the Chromecast. The video will stutter and lose audio sync for a few minutes, before disconnecting completely. I understand, the device is pretty inexpensive, but no 5ghz it's a pretty big omission these days.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I don't even know where to start. Seth totally saved himself him. ❤️❤️❤️❤️<br /><br />But this is the perfect ending, now I'm gonna go cry because I feel like my Dog died....tears....Since this is the last book. But there could've not been a more perfect ending to Alex's journey.  I'm in love with Jennifer & not afraid to say it!* 😉
B007TR1R22|5.0|I admire Terence Davies for attempting to film Terence Rattigan's THE DEEP BLUE SEA, one of the most searing, beautifully-written dramas of the modern English theatre.  The play was a tremendous success when it was first staged in the London West End, starring Peggy Ashcroft as Hester Collyer, and all who were able to see it then were mesmerized by Ashcroft's honest, heart-rending performance.  Davies gave the film a carefully modulated rendition of the Rattigan original, trying to make it accessible to contemporary audiences.  His is a fine film, well acted, handsomely made.  Rachel Weisz is an excellent actress and her Hester is quite believable.  I just wish that Anatole Litvak's 1955 film, now totally forgotten, could be made available in DVD, if anything for the chance of seeing Vivien Leigh as Hester.  Vivien had the exact age to tackle the role then and, besides, was going through a difficult period, often vulnerable, slowly approaching the end of her marriage to Laurence Olivier.  Today's audiences do not remember who Terence Rattigan was, or even who were Peggy Ashcroft or Vivien Leigh, so many may find Davies' film utterly boring.  This is indeed very sad.  A sign of the times we live in, when a good story and very recognizable human feelings are seen as unexciting things from the past.
B00CMN5N7S|5.0|2nd best movie of the century so far, if you're interested in human beings. The acting alone is worth it. Fox Searchlight where were you?
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|Basic premise was slow in developing.  Ending was contrived to create excitement for the movie-goer (understandable).  Did not meet &#34;hype&#34; level as promoted.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Niceeeeee charger, it´s perfect for me! works perfect and charge my iphone so fast. Good Quality! Used for 3 months and has solved my problem with my iphone battery
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Funny stuff I like Wahlberg in just about eveything he does, refreshing humor and satire and can I say cute without being strange..
B003JYOEYM|2.0|It would have been a decent zombie movie if it wasn't for the Irish cowboy feud. That situation just detracted from the story, I don't know if they were trying to be funny or not, it they were it just came off as stupid. The acting wasn't bad though, I enjoyed most of the movie, except for the Irish cowboy feud.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Not as good as the Bonds of yesterday but still it was good and interesting and D. Craig is not a handsome man like the Bonds before him just my opinion.
B00BIHWVWY|5.0|You made a very nice music player. It looks good. I love the audio visualizer. I hope that you will update it soon with more graphic choices instead of just one. Great app! Thanks!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great acting and storyline. The aliens are cool and bad at the same time.Sadly there is no one named Chicken Little.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I thought it was well written and I was surprised to know that there was really  orphan trains during those years in America
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Absolutely fantastic.  Went to a movie the other day, and every woman in the ladies room was talking about it!  A must read!
B00EUGYM04|4.0|Great album. I would easily give five stars but unfortunately it has yet to be added for downloading from my Amazon cloud. I guess that's alright I just manually ripped it to my library,  it was already embedded with all the album info.  Great work Seether!!!
6305558167|5.0|Classic. Masterpiece. Why must you even be informed of this? The immortal tale of Camelot, retold with style, enough devotion to origin material, and overpowering soundtrack.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|You release it for the kindle fire.  We have 4 kindles and none of them are compatible with this game????????????  If you release the game you need to make it available for ALL kindle fires!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Exciting and challenging game as well as being quite frustrating at times. I have been on the same level now for weeks but will eventually get it and be off to a new level.
0988262592|3.0|A thinly veiled version of Eli Goldratt's The Goal set in IT.  If you haven't read The Goal and you're in IT, you will find this helpful.  Written as a novel (like The Goal), its thesis is that IT's challenges can be framed and addressed in the same way as manufacturing's.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's still a little buggy and not to many apps are available for it. Come on Google open this thing up for other developers!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Glad this finally became available on the Kindle! I've been waiting for quite a while for this.  The graphics are amazing.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Great movie and it came in great condition and at a good price. If you've seen this movie and liked it, you need to own it.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Best series ever.  Can not wait for the next.  Actually I added Showtime to my Dish package so I could keep up with the story rather than wait until it comes out on DVD.  Great  acting and Great story.  You never know whats next..  Thank you for these actors and especially these writers. They are all a 10 star.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This is my go to album right now. Always related heavy to Slim, but this one almost feels like a soundtrack sometimes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Gave it a 5 star because I like the series.  It's really a story about people who care about other people.  We do not have enough of this in our world today.  Can't wait to see the Christian movie Noah.
B001IF252C|5.0|This works great out of box like all Apple products. Apple knows how to get things done right.  Thanks Apple  :)
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I don't think it is the best but it is okay fine for the game<br /> it is not the worst
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I only had this game for a little bit. I is pretty SMOKEN awesome though. I want to buy the super deaisal.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Lousy editing, bad dialogue, mediocre acting, and a silly plot.  Just watch 28 Days Later, even if you've seen it before.  It's a better use of your time.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|A twisted love story that ended well this time. Ana and Christian are working it out. Book 2 well played!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I think this game is really fun...it's kind of like city story and its a good time killer without u having to waste too much time so far:)
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I like this version of Chess for Kindle Fire.  There are lots of options to choose from.  Also, the graphics are very pretty.  This is a good choice!  I like AI Factory's work.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Would it really be that difficult for the kindle edition to have a table of contents with the chapter titles (Arya IV, Catelyn II, etc) instead of meaningless numbers?
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is a good choice for the Kindle Fire.  It allows you to browse your files, in addition to creating new Word, Excel, and Powerpoint files.  It will even let you ZIP and email a file or a group of files.  Also, I like the fact that I can download files from the cloud onto my tablet without the need for a different app.  For big jobs, I recommend a PC or Mac.  However, if you don't mind learning a new interface and typing at a snails pace, it is an alright app.
B006212C66|4.0|Good series so far, never watched it before.  Getting more and more interesting the further you get into it.  thanks
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like Facebook for the Kindle Fire.  I use it all the time.  There are more options available to you if you use a PC or Mac instead.  However, this app still retains a lot of the features that I use most often; for example, event info, news feed stories, photo album viewing, videos, etc.  Facebook games do not work in this version of Facebook; you would need an actual computer for that.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I was worried about it since Robin is a girl, but the movie was fantastic.  Not a boring moment and 3rd movie directed by Jay Oliva that was excellent.  Now only we can get a decent Superman movie
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I like this version of Checkers for the Kindle Fire.  There are several options from which to choose.  Plus, the graphics are very pretty.  I like all of the AI Factory games that I have downloaded thus far!
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|I was worried about it since Robin is a girl, but the movie was fantastic.  Not a boring moment and 3rd movie directed by Jay Oliva that was excellent that I have seen. I kind of wanted TAS  voices but since all of them are older it makes since to have different Batman voices. Now only we can get a decent Superman movie<br /><br />P.S. If you're a Reagan fan, stay away!
B009V0TV6O|5.0|I downloaded this metronome app for Kindle Fire.  It only works in landscape orientation.  The app is easy to use and very fun.  I like the convenience of the programmable presets.  Also, I like exploring the rhythmic variations that are available for each beat.  It makes you think!  The tempo tap feature is very cool.  Overall, this is an excellent choice.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This is basically the 2D edition of Minecraft, only with about one hundred more items, AND IT'S AWESOME!!!! There are bosses, an underworld, and sky islands! It is so awesome!! It is totally worth five-ten dollars.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|After a few levels it makes you pay two bucks to continue, but its a fun game until that.  A little hard to distinguish the shapes at times, more contrast would help.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|i so love this show.  i kinda wish i was julst like dexter.  to be able to kill and not be caught wowo
B001O17SY0|3.0|There is nothing I can add about my strong feelings for this film or its poor english dub that has not already been stated by the reviewers prior to me and probably after me as well. I am writing this review to tell whomever is reading it that the Netflix version of this film has English Subtitle and its really great and possibly Amazon Rental thingy does too. I would hate for anyone to watch this film, especially for the first time and have to deal with really bad voice-over acting.<br /><br />I look forward to a deluxe copy of this film to be made that has commentary and a choice between having subtitles or dubs or none, and maybe a whole new English overdub for those who want it. okay thats about it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a cool game to play when you are bored. It gets a little confusing sometimes tho. And it is really hard to keep up with money.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Super simple better than our roku.  Only thing wish it had screen mirroring for Android all in all great value
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|done right, this could easily knock off some of the HBO and showtime programs that have us glued to the tv every season.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I needed help sleeping and my old sound machine stopped working. This app has more than I could have hoped for. Mixing several sounds has made it a blessing to sleep. I have not tried all the settings yet, but I<br />am sure that I won't be disappointed.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This is dumb I tried to watch a video and it didn't let me now I wasted money that I didn't have to waste and they are not giving money back
B0054LJGWS|5.0|A fun, lighthearted end of the world story from literary masters. I need 10 more words for Amazon to be happy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Most amazing best book ever. This is a must read. I can't even omg BEST BOOK EVER. JOHN GREEN IS NOW MY IDOL.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun.  I've played temple run but this is way better. It lets you update without money,and the best part is the costumes!!!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Used this app for about a month (give or take). Then, today I opened the game up only to find it had reset itself. I lost everything (level, score, prizes, puzzle pieces, bonus stuff). Anyway, thankfully I didn't drop any money into it by purchasing DDs or that probably would have been reset too. Anyway, no biggie... I won't waste anymore time on it though.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|Watched the commentary for the second time. Awesome explanations as to why Constantine has black hair and isn't British (alas but understandable). The transcontinental difference in the pronunciation of Constantine &#34;rhymes with spleen&#34;, Constantine &#34;rhymes with fine&#34; is explained - and it was funny. Special features besides the commentary included special effects explanations n little documentaries on subjects like the relics of Constantine. Really dug it.
0399157573|3.0|Disappointing.  I've read the entire Kay Scarpetta series.  This was my least favorite by far.  The book was at least 200 pages too long.  The writing was very repetitive throughout, yet seemed to end quite abruptly.  The only reason my rating wasn't lower is because the plot was actually interesting.  I have to wonder if the author used a ghostwriter on this one...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app I.play it every day you will love it so u should get this app I promise u will love it
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Didn't realize I bought 2 of the same Dark Shadows DVD Dark Shadows DVD Dark Shadows DVD Dark Shadows DVD
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is long..but is written extremely well. The story gives young sense of how you should really cherish life! Worth the read!
0062107313|4.0|As a 75 year old Chinese American, I found The Valley of Amazement to be a most ambitious effort to cover China's recent history from the Qing Dynasty to World War II.  The platform was through the characters of 3 generations of mothers and daughters and their challenges of survival in a feudalistic, male-dominated society.  It is no surprise that a major theme is one of uncertain mother's love that is not entirely resolved, even after 40 years.  Interwoven within this framework are questions of Fate, True Love, Hope, Loyalty, Despair, and the reliability of Chinese men.<br /><br />Not to be ignored is the historic detail during China's emergence from a monarchy to a republic, China's subjugation to the foreign powers, e.g. America, Great Britain, France and Japan.  Also noteworthy is the changing Women's role toward emancipation.<br /><br />I appreciated the historic detail as Ms. Tan very ably described China during my father's  formative years in China.  What was lacking would be thoughtful editing to maintain good tension and avoid bothersome minutiae.<br /><br />Other reviewers (Evelyn)  have most ably described the high points of Valley.  But if you are an Amy Tan fan as I am, you can find this book quite a worthwhile read, but try not to compare it with Joy Luck Club, since that was many years ago, and Ms. Tan has matured and changed since then!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|its a fun game. very addictive don't want to put it down.  fun for all ages. this game is fun and fusterating all in one
0321934318|5.0|Scott Kelby is clean,concise and humorous.  Easy to understand and goes step by step.  Read it through and start at page 1.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is just what I wanted. It was nicely packaged and arrived earlier than expected. This will make a wonderful Christmas gift in addition to the PS3 game system.
B00GI8AMI8|3.0|Help!! I never considered myself &#34;plum dumb&#34;  lol, but where is the strategy guide??? Where is the hint or clue s? And, where in the world is the note book/journal??  Gotta have a notebook/journal! So, I will be the first to say...&#34;I have taken my own notes, I've gone back and forward and front and right to left and back again...'I need some kinda clue.  Game at this point, makes no sense!!  I will definitely be leery of Echo Lake in the future.  Sorry, but give me something...just ole Davey getting this place out of luck is great, but I gotta have  more.  Lol
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like this app. It does the job. Keeps track of the overall battery life, stand by life, how much power is left to watch a video, plus the graphics are pretty cool.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Other than the ads it's not a bad game. Similar to Mario of course, game could use a little more difficulty.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Grisham's latest book. I had a hard time doing anything else until I finished it. Though I guessed what would happen, the unpredictability of the jury and the history of the Rinds and Hubbard families kept me engrossed. I have read at least 5 other novels by Grisham. I found this one of, if not, the best. Though lawyers appear here sometimes as money-hungry opportunists, Jake, Judge Atlee, and even his drinking buddy-lawyers have qualities the reader can admire. Justice and fairness prevail.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game has a bunch of awsome ways to beet a level and all people should love this game the only bad thing is you get so addicted to the game
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|This book was typical Grisham of late. It does not compare with his earlier books like Kane and Abel or  A Time to Kill
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I am a mid-western transplant to the south and the very essence of this culture has been captured in word by the author.  I feel as though I know the characters.  Could not put the book down!
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book after hearing the author on NPR. BUT -- the book is boring in the extreme -- gave up after a third of the book!
B001PPGAIA|3.0|This is a wonderful saga, with lots of scenery, and a cool smattering of great mind over matter. Nice to have.
B003O86FMW|5.0|GooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooD book to read at home or on the rode good for air plains wacth the movie that's good to
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Brilliant in its twists.  Such a pleasure to race after the author's leading plot and see inside the minds of his typically flawed, believable, weak, but likeable human characters.  And what an ending!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It is an easy to use app that can help you &#34;remember everything&#34;. (Their motto.) There are so many ways to save notes. You can speak a note, take a picture and put it in a notebook, or type it in. They have a way to create a check list for traveling, grocery list or even just a to do list. And you can link it to all your devices, including the Kindle Fire HD, android phone and computer. They say you can dictate notes from meetings. I'm sure that as I use it, I'll have more of an appreciation for it.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|The standard icon in the upper corner does this already. It should instead show. a list of apps that are using battery draining resources.
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|I tried clearing my kindle to get it to work, it still would not work!!!!!! if you go I pod, use that
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love love love this game.... so glad they have it for my kindle......can't get enough of it..... Love love it....
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one of my favorite bingo games to play. I love the free tournament you get to play everyday. It's a great game with great conversation with other players.
B000002L61|5.0|A great album , RJD had a powerfull voice that gave a lot of strength to his music. Black Sabbaths Heaven and Hell IMO is the first Sabbath album that qualifies as real metal and that because of Dios voice. Its a shame he only produced 2 albums with Sabbath.<br />Last in Line the music video was the coolest video I ever saw when it first came out... now it looks laughingly cheesy but back then....man it was a new definition of awesomeocity :). Each song on this album  is pretty rockin but Egypt (The Chains Are On) has a vibe to it thats kind of odd. I still wonder who it was that he was singing about , beings that are beautiful , fantastic and terrifying, angels? demons? ETs? he seemed to write a lot of lyrics that moved in mythology and 'magic'  ect. Normally I have litte paitience for that kind of nonsense even in music (which traffics a lot in such imagery) but Dio lends it a depth and flavor that makes it engaging.<br />Lastly the album cover is so filled with iconography I wrote an essay deconstructing it . I got an 'A' for it  but I excelled at BSing back then  :)
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If you loved 'A Time to Kill,' you'll really enjoy 'Sycamore Row' just as much.  Grisham just knows how to write and tell a good story and this is one of his best!
1452126607|4.0|Cat fans love this grumpy looking fink, he looks so stern and upset but inside we know he's an adorable feline.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like it because you can put costumes on your minion.  it is really fun to play.  It is awesome
1909313033|4.0|I obtained this for a person who loves pugs. The book did not disappoint, though the novelty of it may wear off sonner than you hope for, as its a shorter book.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I have attempted to download this app several times but it keeps saying my kindle cant install this app...has anyone else had this issue? especially since this is the closest to youtube I'm gonna get. does anyone know of any other apps that download youtube properly?
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Shipping time was spectacular, over a couple of hours, delivered the next day.<br />Chromecast works only with Chrome browser in PC only, not using Chrome on Ipad. I was expecting that I would see on TV what I selected to play on-screen. in other words if I wanted to view photos from my ipad or computer I should have been able to, but only chrome for PC or Mac would display any photos not from photo viewer. Major lacking functionality to view video from Ipad on the TV Screen. Forget to view movies in the TV from your Ipad. Major disappointment with Chromecast's cross platform functionality.  I will have to check with Android phone to see if it works or disappoints by forcing Chrome to be used.<br /><br />No instructions in package, only indicates user to go to their web page.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|Not one likable or trustworthy character on the pilot.<br />I'd hate to think that the entire police force was this cynical and corrupt.
B00136Q1I0|5.0|What is there to say about Bruce!  Another record to complete my collection!  All the hits and more and more!
B009NF54ZE|3.0|game plays well but too many of the images are too tiny on the kindle fire screen...have to use hints or skip mini puzzles cause no zoom function on many screens
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|works beautifully with my extra HDMI monitor and my nexus 7.  it's awesome and easy to use.  i was pleased that I didn't need to purchase a television.<br /><br />only frustration is when I stream directly from my laptop/google chrome, it won't fill the monitor screen.  alas, I've got to use my tablet.
1250029465|3.0|Not the best writing, but I have a feeling that the book was meant to &#34;read&#34; like that.  Cute story, heartening.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it so much that I am completely hooked  I love it my mom loves it<br />My whole family loves it purchase this now
B001NLKXK2|5.0|An amazing auto-biography...early onset Alzheimer's, not something I'd ever wish on anyone.  at times a sad but inspiring book and worth a read for anyone facing or experiencing Alzheimer's with family or friends.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Great game for the most part recommend this game if you like magic the gathering. My only complaint is that their is not much stuff to do in the free version and the full version is 10$.
1781162646|3.0|Not that great a book, was disappointed in the story...then again, what did I expect?  I am not a huge Stephen King fan.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Love it.  A real jewel. The story was interesting. If you like the other studio ghibli films you will like this one.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is a great writer and his books always hold me glued to them. This book is a fabulous reading, educational too!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|i'm having so much fun reading this series.  i'm savoring this last installment since i kind of tore through the first two.  have pre-ordered the shorts coming up later this year and early next.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|In this dystopian future that is eerily like a side story from the novel 1984, you will read on in horror as 100 kids walk to their deaths for the ultimate prize...only to realize they are giving away the greatest prize...their lives
B00FHATBGW|1.0|Stuck in the mansion at the water barrel. Checked walkthrough for help...none. Asked forum for help...none. Asked Big Fish for help...none. Uninstalled, reinstalled and started at the beginning but still had same issue.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|I lost interest during various parts of the book. It's not a book that kept my interest. Didn't finish it.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My 7 yr olds birthday present, he loves it!! I have since bought 2 more...and will buy 2-3 more Scheich Dinosaurs for Christmas!! Even our 2 yr old loves them!!
0446555002|3.0|This wasn't the usual fantastic book they usually write - the second half was too unbelievable and I skipped some of it, which I never ordinarily do.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|It has been a long time since I've encountered such an extraordinary work of art. It is an obligatory read.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|This game says that it is not compadibal so it was a wast of money but if people fugue out how to get it tell me
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It doesn't replace hunting but when your stuck in the hospital on opening day it works. I like the thAt there's a bonus for special shots to. It really helps passing the time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is soooooo fun I'm so addicted to it I cant stop playing it. the minions are so funny.
B00DL2W7Q4|3.0|It's a good read. However, I didn't quite feel I learnt something completely new or that my mind was stimulated in some new way. Outliers for example challenged the notion that hard work inevitably leads to success. It launched a whole debate about the methodology that had been employed to reach a number of somewhat controversial conclusions. This book simply doesn't do that. It explores a number of stories, great stories actually, and makes fairly predictable conclusions that ones handicap, physical or experiential, can also be the source of their greatest strength. If it were another author, I probably would rate it higher, but this is Malcom and I expect more.
B005721W9O|4.0|It was certainly silly, but it was also entertaining.  We got some good laughs out of it.  Be prepared for corny though.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|Endless fight scenes make this inferior to first two. Special effects bonanza but not much of a story. Too bad.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|As always, Celine doesn't disappoint. I was expecting a great CD and that's exactly what I got!  I can't imagine anyone ever having a greater voice than this.
B00EODUWQ6|5.0|I don't often give 5 stars in my reviews, but since I almost did not buy it due to many bad reviews I thought I would review this.<br /><br />This book touches on a number of relevant issues today.  Lack of competition in many important industries.  Global corporations power over government to enact policies and regulations favorable to them at the expense of the citizens.  A complete breakdown of privacy rights in the private and public sectors using security as a pretext.  Peoples own complicity in surrendering rights for security, or even the illusion of security.<br /><br />Put them all together in the worst way and you have all the makings of a Global Totalitarian State.<br /><br />The author does a good job in writing an entertaining novel and developing the character of the main protagonist.  At the risk of nitpicking he made a couple of mistakes like not knowing the cloud is actually a physical storage, and not knowing that smoke detectors don't detect CO2.  But those are minor issues that did not bother me too much.<br /><br />Some argue that he did not research the inner workings of social media companies and Google and did not understand the inner workings of these companies, or the tech behind them.  So what?  I imagine those working for social media companies and the like may feel threatened by this book and feel compelled to rate this book negatively, as is their right.<br /><br />The company he created in his story is not a real company, not yet anyways, and the idea that good employees may not know the hidden agenda of upper management (or government) is hardly far fetched.<br /><br />While some still have the misguided belief that social media and the internet empower the people and promote democracy, and when working properly it can, but one only has to look at countries like China who use these tools to detect and track dissidents and promote their own propaganda, while also censoring the content.  Even today at home these tools are being used forpurposes not entirely transparent and not necessarily good reasons.<br /><br />I can't put this in the same league as 1984 since we did not actually get a look at a world where the Circle was completed, just a glimpse.  I also did not find it very believable that everyone in the government were simply gullible pawns and not in a position to profit from the empowerment of the Circle.  Maybe a sequel will give us a better look.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Good time playing game, longer you go into the game harder it gets. Sometime frustrating,then you clear a level and don't even know what you did different from the 100 times before
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|Oh no. Cornwell has led us through every tedious and paranoid thought of dear Dr. Scarpetta's churning brain over the few days as she solves the case. It's too tiring. And of course every action revolves around the heroine as the unrealistic center of the universe. After you get into the pace of the novel you can skip multiple paragraphs of Cornwell/Scarpetta's analysis of the characters' emotions and absurd relational motivations and move more quickly through the somewhat redeeming plot of the story. It might be amusing also to go back and tally up how many times Scarpetta's thoughts were 'uneasy' or 'unsettled' snore, snore.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and easy to play, keep trying you will get it. Can be as motive for Musgrove ducks that templates for the best way
1476727651|5.0|Excellent book.  Just what you would expect from Stephen King.  Interesting, weird characters and a lot of action.  Great sequel to The Shining.  Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is the best it is not that bloody and great for kids it is so epic so Awesome
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I got it and I loved it because it is fun for all ages broneys or not it is fun
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I love how she wanted to share her point of view.  It is controversial and can rub against the grain at times, but if you keep an open mind and find even the smallest ways to apply what she has to say the rewards can be great.
B00F1W1S1M|5.0|This is by far the best Dream Theater live album/bluray/dvd. As always, the band's performance is virtually flawless. Labrie's performance is jaw dropping at times and very good the majority of the time. The MIX is POWERFUL, HUGE, and BEAUTIFUL. This is a must own for all Dream Theater fans and I highly recommend it for the casual fan. 5 stars all the way. It's definitely one of the best live concert DVD/Blurays I've ever watched.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|We're huge Matthew McConaughey fans but this one quite frankly sucked.  None of the normally spectacular action scenes you're used to seeing, a dull and boring plot and a general waste of 4 bux.
B009HEMJCW|5.0|I love happy movies.  I especially love ones with a real point to them.  I especially-especially love movies that have a point to them that people need to remember and be reminded of more often: &#34;it's not the power of the curse, it's the power you give the curse.&#34; This one line summarizes the whole movie and was given to a child to say, which was in good taste.  Don't worry, that wasn't a spoiler.  Even if you don't like girly movies you may feel good that you watched this one... watch until the end to appreciate.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I love this movie!Best love story I've seen in a long time! I got the movie for my grandmother,and I know she'll love it too!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|After reading 'The Signature of all Things' by Elizabeth Gilbert, it was logical to read her earlier best seller, 'Eat, Pray, and Love'.  Gilbert appears to be honest and candid about her past life. The Pray section appealed most to me. The section on Love seemed hurried and not as well thought-out as the first two sections of the book.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Considering that I am playing this on a Kindle Fire, this game is great. I wish there were more like it
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|We Loved this movie!  This is one that would make everyone laugh.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Great story.
B0016OM3TU|5.0|The sound track is amazing. If you like jazz this is the movie for you. I saw Dexter Gordon live in Salem Mass. years ago. He was playing his life on screen.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|So many soldiers and the only problem is that expanding is expensive<br /><br />Awesomeness in a nutshell<br /><br />Till you shoot that
B000T433CO|5.0|What a beautiful love story with humor and tears at the same time. All actors were so beautiful in their own way.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Fun puzzles. I like that there are different types and not all hidden objects. It also seems like it would be great for all age. My 8 year old son enjoys it too.
B0091VYG86|5.0|So funny and touching at the same time. The actors were so young! Movie gives a lot of things to think about when human nature kicks in on things that are not normal.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Really it would be 3.5 stars for this movie, but not sure how to do half star rating.  Fun movie!
1476727651|5.0|Excellent, delicious thriller!  kept me turning the pages. Could not put it down, and when I did, I was still thinking about the story.  Vintage Stephen King.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love it! Have a great time to realize that you can! I LOVE it the was a so amazing games!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved this book.  When I wasn't reading it called to me to get back to it.  What else can I say?
B004EI2NM2|5.0|This movie is sexy, but also realistic. It reflects that lesbians are regular people, not sexual fiends (like a lot of &#34;lesbian&#34; movies portray). They are real people who meet and have a real connection. I really love this story, and I would love it even if it was a straight couple. A definite buy for every lesbian or hopeless romantic!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game - highly addictive and gives your brain a real workout.  Wish it was longer.  Bring on more levels!  Please!
B004EQAVHI|5.0|I can't get enough of this movie. The books are really good as well. The story is beautiful, sad, romantic, realistic, futuristic. It's everything you are looking for out of a movie. Excellent casting.
B00340LM8C|5.0|Classic Cary Grant. Fun and suspenseful! At his debonair best. Plus, great scenery and great character actors in supporting roles.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This is good simple and darkly cute game. It is a good app if your a sitting in the waiting room at the doctors, great time waster.
0399255370|5.0|I am going to give the book as a gift.  I read it and feel the child I am giiving the book to will enjoy it as well.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|adequate watch<br />Nice watch looks good good for work waterproof but loses about 5 minutes a month ive owned Seiko watches for 25 years & they all kept perfect time.  but this watch, @ 65$ is also the least expensive Seiko Ive owned.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Imaginative, brilliant story telling, writing.  Wonderfully moving story of a young man's adventures and life. The author<br />is incredibly talented.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|A fun game for Android. Build rockets and try to get them into orbit. Good tutorials to get you started. Good time killer. Not so simple you're instantly bored but not so complex you REALLY have to be a rocket scientist to play.
B003PIUBZS|2.0|No doubt I'll be skewered for a negative review of such a popular show, but here goes anyway.  I checked out &#34;Season One&#34; (4 DVD set) from my library after hearing so much about it but never having seen it.  I could barely get through the first disk before I was climbing the walls with tedium.<br /><br />This is, in essence, a &#34;gladiator soap opera.&#34;  A high-budget glitzy production, for sure.  But it comes with silly plots (and subplots), pedestrian dialog and second-rate acting.  Throw in lots of gratuitous and irrelevant Hollywood violence, gore and nudity and there you have it:  a commercial success but an artistic failure.  Historical drama it is not.  In fact, ART it is not;  if anything, it's forgettable CRAFT.<br /><br />Watching it made me feel like I was trying to eat a cake that is all icing and no cake.  I guess heaping spoonfuls of icing appeal to lots of people, but not me.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|This is an awesome dvd.  If it could be rated 10 stars it would still not be enough!!!  The band sounds even better than when they were young!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to install (simple plug-in to your TV HDMI USB) and fairly easy set up for untech types like myself. You must download the Google browser for it to work.  Love the choices I have now to stream onto our HD TV.
1439153663|2.0|It was hard to keep track of all the characters. i really had trouble getting through it. ok club suggestion
B003CHGV74|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this show.  This storyline and development of the characters are unmatched. I very bummed it came to an end tho.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|Cluttered action sequences, characters with inconsistent and unrelatable goals, a borderline sociopathic Pa Kent and an unsympathetic Superman who seems to have next to no regard for human life render this movie a confused mess.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|There 're no words to explain how good this story was. It was so touching. I would defiantly read it if I was you. \(°_°)/
B00FHB7398|2.0|I took  a chance on this game, because Big Fish games and I have become great friends recently. Both Shiver games and the Drawn game were phenomenal. I got the demos, then ended up buying the games.<br /><br />This game did not have a demo, and  I have now learned my lesson. This game isn't horrible.....but it is  NOT on par with some of the other games. Between every scene change, the screen blacks out and you have to wait. To read your journal, the screen blacks out and you have to wait. You cannot just click on a door to open it, you must click then confirm with the arrow.  There was just no smooth flow to the game. I usually play the advanced mode in these games, but I had to switch to casual mode to get more help, because the clues were random and confusing. In the other games, you feel like you ARE the character. Not the case with this one.<br /><br />I'm still a loyal big Fish fan, but I won't buy a game blindly again. This game felt so...mechanical.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grishham goes back to the southern community of his first novel.  And we are again following the adventures of the local attorney as he is drafted by a dead rich widower to fight off his family and follow the directions of his will.  This is not as controversial as a black man who shot his daughter's rapists, but it does have race, small town politics, court intrigue, and oversize characters. Grisham again keeps our interest until the very end. A great book.  Just what we would expect.
1600597963|5.0|I am so excited to get my planning and actions pieces going, this really has some great ideas, inspiration, great information, and let's you know you can think outside of the box with your ideas. Eye Candy for sure
B007PVHMCG|5.0|The best. I would pay $200 buck for this. especially if its from the amazon marketplace. those guys rock! yep
B00FAVRFXE|4.0|HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY WRITE A REVIEW BEFORE IT AIRS ON SIMUL-CASTat 2:50 pm GMT?? THERE ARE STILL 15 HOURS LEFT BEFORE IT AIRS worldwide! What a roomful of anxious and silly WHOvians!
B005HI7NP0|5.0|Betty Wright holds her own on this cd. Love it ! wish she do more cd like this to excite the next generation to get into her!
B00FLDG42Y|5.0|The blyray &#34;Clockwork Angels&#34; tour is the best 20 dollars I have ever spent!  AWESOME!  Anyone who doesn't like it just doesn't get Rush!  Us old guys can still rock!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush, and love to be able to play on my kindle fire!!!!  The saga edition is the version to play by far.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|It has interesting characters and quick storyline.  The end was unique in that it didn't tie up all the loose ends, and usually I find that annoying.  I will continue on with the series.
031623480X|5.0|info for everyone that wants to avoid alzheimers, or to help if you already have it, or if there is family history of it.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|really enjoying playing this game.  You do not get bogged down on a difficult puzzle.  Lots of different things to do.  Recommend to anyone.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|The game is a little wordy, but otherwise the puzzles are decent. I AM NOT ONE TO COMPLAIN WHEN IT'S FREE!!!  Graphics are very nice. There is the ability to enlarge the screen for the search puzzles, which is nice for us &quot;older&quot; people (LOL). Overall great game for the price.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Same as most Baldacci stories.  Consistently fast paced, easy to read and entertaining. If you like David Baldacci you most likely enjoy this series.
B0077DBZXO|5.0|My granddaughter has asked to see this a few times now. I am certain she will be asking for it again
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Good story, easy read. Decent story with many familiar plot lines. Good book for beginner sci-fi youngsters. Am only reading book 2 because it's free.
B003VANOFY|5.0|It is GREAT! I don't have any connection drop outs. The only time that happens is when microwaving something. That makes sense. Otherwise the battery life is good. The 7.1 is amazing. Yes it isn't true 7.1. My ears don't care. The software is ok. I'd buy again. I just don't get how they can charge so much...
B005V1WVPA|5.0|One of their better albums. It's amazing that these guys are still around after all these years.  I'd recommend it.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book is amazing.  Thank you Malcolm.  It changed my life.  Much of it were things I'd known and thought however it was articulated exceptionally well in this book.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I love my little pony I buy pony but I have 1  gem it is cool the mini Game is easy  twilght has a brother that is married<br />Princess candace is her foltsitter
0671449028|5.0|Cute story to help my two year olds wind down before bed.  It's a short book so I usually read it with another book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!But I wish there were energy! Other wise I recommend this game 100%!So buy it now! Now now
0399226907|4.0|Classic story that you won't go wrong with.  It's a tiny book though.  I should have read the dimensions for this one.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The game is very fun I love All the fun adventures that go along with it. The game shows strategy and organization of you products
141694737X|5.0|Our twin 2 yr old boys love this book.  They take turns lifting the flap and now have it memorized.  It's just long enough to capture their attention.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I am actually having a hard time even finishing Allegiant.  I loved the first 2 titles in the trilogy and couldn't put them down.  The nonstop action in Divergent and Insurgent is completely lacking in this one.  I'm 75% through the book and the alternating points of view of the main characters has gotten tiresome.  I have to say that I'm really disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love the game. It's fun, like the movies, and addictive. But, I keep having issues with the game not responding, restarting multiple times in a row, and the graphics flashing. It may be not compatible with my tablet which is a Toshiba.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A tale for our times. Who could Katniss have been if the Games had not impacted her life? Current circumstances are forcing many to look inside themselves and see what they are made of.  Choose the method of your destruction.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Even if you're not a reader-Make yourself read this book. It will cause a stirring in your soul and you will be better for it.
B005SJIP2S|2.0|Being a long time Yes fan, I have always appreciated the fact that the group sounds youthful, energetic, and timeless, regardless of the incarnation of the band's lineup or the era of performance- except for this one album, where the performances are slow and plodding.  It almost feels like some of the songs are about to grind to a halt midway.  I also couldn't help but wonder whether the senior band members were \\"teaching\\" these songs to their rookie members by running the songs slower.  While Howe and Squire demonstrate their excellence and proficiency, as always, they are at times sloppy and disjointed, which I believe is due to struggles to maintain the abnormally slow tempos of the songs.  The lead singer is fine and passable, but I do miss Anderson's persona.  Oliver Wakeman, although talented, lacks some of father Rick's precision and soulfulness, but he sounds like he could be \\"almost there,\\" so maybe it's just a matter of \\"practice-makes-perfect...\\" which kinda makes sense in this \\"rehearsal-sounding\\" album.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|What else can I say about the wonderful Jane Austen that hasn't been said before? Emma is my favorite story by Ms. Austen. I love how Emma is a head strong character. To me, she's full of life and loves her friends. Once I started reading the story, I couldn't put it down and have read it over and over since. While, this is not one of her most popular works, it still holds a huge place in my heart!
B006S08RLU|5.0|If it is possible to fall in love with a film, this might be the one for me.  Everything about this film - script, direction, cinematography, music, etc. - just works in perfect harmony, and it is difficult to imagine anyone but Audrey Tautou in the role of Amelie, as she fits it so perfectly.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|I can't really comment on this as it is going to be a gift. It looks nice & I'm sure it will be very usefull. She will be able to keep all the Barbie dolls  together.
B00B6CQIO8|5.0|This is a high-class, beautiful story. My wife and I both love it, although we have very different tastes. The actors are fantastic.
B00ESLTNR8|3.0|It's difficult to read a book from a period so long ago.  The language is different and, of course, life was very different then than it is now.  I have not yet finished it, but I will eventually.  Of course, it's a classic and one I've never read.  Well written, but just not easy to get through.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the ending and how it all comes together in the end. The romance between Katniss and Peeta is also unexpected
B00ESJICMC|5.0|I never liked James blunt, I never liked his vocals and thought he tries too hard to cater to a commercial female audience. I actually got to closely listen to this album and liked it. It's really good and moody, lots of variety, complex emotions. Even though I still dislike the vocals, the lyrics, production, feel, and more of the cd makes up for it
1932100660|5.0|A real eye-opener. A This book is not as much about how to do it,  but more about the why's and the what's . If you are concern and alarmed about what is going on with your friends, family in terms of the state of their health and are somewhat suspicious as to the state of medicine in this country, you owe yourself to read this book cover to cover. Then, what iso left is to make up your own mind.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Really enjoyed the beginning but the author lost me later in the book.  The message was interesting and certainly in tune with the times.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Awesome this game is like freaking awesome I love when you use the power ups and when you get to use the basic jetpack there are gums when you fly. I like using the bad as hog and the wave runner and the profit bird and the lol stomped and the crazy freaking teleporter
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|cant complain<br />netflix quality better than roku<br />I wish more apps in this and over all good little guy for your techie colllection
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is really fun the best part is you get to eat people  but  I wish there were more stuff and more sharks get this game for your kindle fire NOW!!!
159463176X|4.0|It wasn't quite the read as his earlier works, skips to diff. plots throughout the book..but was worth while reading..
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This product is amazing.<br /><br />It's quality is supreme but with a such low price.<br /><br />the outlook is a little bit outdated
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is just awesome. You should try it. Awesome and realistic graphics. Awesome moves and attacks. And the best is its free!
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|I love this version.  The scenes and costumes are wonderful.  I suppose it is not as accurate as the earlier versions of Queen Elizabeth but I enjoyed it.  Cate Blanchett is wonderful as well.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Loved this series.  It had me guessing until the end.  Love the development of Jules as a strong female character.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|working good only as youtube player for tv, netflix only work on US territory, can see the brower but in low quality...
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! It has some very difficult puzzles to figure out. How to get the rock to bounce in the way needed to destroy multiple targets. Graphics are good. A friend of mine told me about this game and as I told him this is why I can't have a tablet at work lol :)
0811879542|5.0|Fantastic story.  My preschool children loves this book so much.  I have to read it several times each time I read it.
0060752610|2.0|..you need an substantial amount of dough, or luck, to make the advise in this book work for you. Probably a very good read in the 70's or even the 80's
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is really amazing, fantastic, mind boggling exciting fun . Anyone not playing this game is missing out on something great.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|Varied play modes, fun little game. I was glad it was free on the App of the Day special, but at least the product doesn't suck. Totally worth a play, at least a couple of times.
B00FLNRN06|4.0|It had it's funny moments. I could of watch it without the f. Word. You have to watch it without small kids around.
B004ZH66XO|2.0|Played it one time. Game was super easy. I knew it was basically a clone of [...] but I expected more for a product that they'd be charging for.
0880793082|5.0|Oh yeah!! Sorry for the late review but um yes; the Item did meet my expectations. It even came with a small book to give the basic meaning of the major and minor arcane. Of course for those who know about the Crowley or Thoth deck; for a more comprehensive meaning for this specific deck, you must use the book called &#34;LIBER LXXVIII(78).&#34;
B00EAIMGDW|2.0|The screenshots made this game look more entertaining than it ended up being. I played it a few times, then I uninstalled it.
1932907009|5.0|This book was so incredibly helpful to me as a novice screenplay writer. I can't wait to get started b/c now it doesn't seem so daunting and overwhelming.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a great game to play. I use to play this all the time on Facebook and much better prefer this one. The missions are better and over all game play is better.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I played this on my kindle and my iphone and my ipod5th jenoration and it is so fun and cool
B000FCKC4C|4.0|This book was free from Book bub.<br />&#34;The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on....&#34; THE RUBAIYAT OF OMAR KHAYYAM and the words and acts of Jesus Christ in The New Testament of THE HOLY BIBLE chased each other across my mind as I read this book.  HEART AND SOUL lyrics joined the race from time to time.  The rating of this quick and easy read depended on my individual input as a reader.  I am ashamed to admit that I worried over Santiago's monetary situation more than any other fortune or misfortune he encountered on his journey to the pyramids of Egypt.  I felt so safe and secure traveling with the alchemist, a representative character of all sacredness and of all that is holy.  He had a good sense of humor, too.<br /><br />I have crossed the horrific deserts of Africa and Asia many times through many books.  I must say this book offered the easiest crossing yet.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Coelho, for a good read.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|I've made it through Kings big books in the past. Not this time. Some reviewers didn't stop for 200 or 300 pages.<br />They were more optimistic than I was. Must have written it in the winter and stayed inside.
B0063IH60K|5.0|always wanted to play the game electronically was glad to see it on the kindle.  I am not good at it but intends to get better hates the popup ads during the game. Still enjoy playing.
B00CBRAD2A|4.0|When it came out to theater; I thought another silly Arnold movie, However I have seen some movie review channels talking how fun  this movie is. So, I decided to check this movie out. I must say I was really impressed with the first half of the movie and ok with the second half; specially towards the end it is super cliché. Overall: Arnold still has it; if you are looking to have a good time with an old style action movie and classic Arnold's one liners; this is the movie for you. Just don't take this movie too serious.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game so much fun to play and never gets boring, need to add more competitions though and maybe make them harder
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book grabs your attention on the first page and does not let go until the last. Great to read
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game.... it's fun to play and funny to watch as well. I would have given it a 5 star rating but I just wish it was easier to get more outfits and more perks..
B000JPRPAO|3.0|it reminded me of Indian action masala movies - it was highly predictable. some action sequences were very good - acting: I would say everyone did their parts well.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great headset, comfortable even after long hours of use and has great sound quality. Would recommend this to others on a heartbeat.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I just received my Fiio E17, and L11 DOC and a Sennheiser 1/4\\" to 1/8\\" cable connector for my Sennheiser HD 595 headphone. After unpacking, quickly reading through the user guid, connecting to my iPod and  here it goes. I was struck by the music and sound quality streaming from my Sennheiser headphone, same songs, music we're never so powerful like this before. I kept scrolling to very old songs, music I have on different devices, MP3, iPod, and I knew that I was really missing this power quality.  The depth, power and clarity was excellent. The E17 dramatically enhanced low Bass that my Sennheiser sometimes was shaking over my ears, without having to increase the volume too much. I was further surprised when I switched to 12db gain, this took the Sennheiser performance to the maximum. I couldn't drop off the headphone for more than 4 hours one shot because I was experiencing something totally different from both the. Sennheiser and my favorite music. I will follow up with more experience sometime later as the weekend just ending :(
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like this game it is a nice change of pace.  Would like to more game like this in the future
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's a great game keep you on your your in when to sell, grow, feed to keep the village growing ,I like it very much
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this book and I am looking forward to reading the next book before seeing the second movie! It is worth reading for any fans of the movies!

B00EX4FEU0|4.0|this was awesome and he loved it, minecraft should have more legos and more kids would be trhilled that is for sure
0307951154|1.0|This was a book club selection for November. After discussing the book at our meeting this past week the reviews were mixed. Most of us found it difficult to follow and called each other prior to the meeting to discuss certain aspects of the book that were clear. This is an intelligent group of women so I doubt it was a comprehension problem. I guess if you were searching for KGB mystery and intrigue you got it with this book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great books<br />I loved it<br />Why do I have to write this review? This is very stupid. I loved the books but hate this.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I really like this game, its fun and keeps me entertained when I'm bored. The graphics are cool. You guys need to bring farmville to the kindle.
B000NY17J6|5.0|A lot of her hits that bring back a flood of memories.  Such a wide range of numbers that display Ronstadt's ability to take any song and make it her own.  Great quality of sound on this remake.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series. This was such an awesome book. I would definitely recommend this series to anyone looking for a great series to read about. I read this before they were thinking of making it a movie. I loved it then and I love it now!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Good and clean. Nice realism.<br />Thanks for the good graphics.<br />This game rocks like Rocky and punches like it, too.
B00701897I|5.0|I started buying a lot of 3D movies after finally getting a 3D TV and so far &#34;Tintin&#34; has been my favorite of all the 3d Movies I have seen at home. Visually stunning, I can't believe how good animated films have become. When I say favorite 3D I don't mean because of the 3d effects hanging out of the screen, or the in your face stuff.  I just mean cause of the graphic's.<br />The Story is pretty good but the visual's are what still the show here.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  The characters were so well developed by Grisham. Can hardly wait for the next book.
B00EJX2YGM|4.0|As a  big fan of the book series and the movies, this set is a must have. A real collectible.  I was absolutely delighted with the features and it's all really well put together in this nice little package. The book-like DVD case is impressive and so appropriate. I was really please by how fast I got the product as well. My one and only remark (the only reason I didn't give 5 stars) is that the digital copy of the movies you're supposed to get can only be accessed on American websites, which I can't get here in Ireland.<br />But it's a great buy, no doubt about it. Twilight Forever!
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|The game is fun but cost money to advance unless you don't mind playing the same few levels for a very long time to accumulate enough coin for upgrades to beat the next levels.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to play, fun, and one can learn quickly how to play. I like the way my Kindle saves my game in case I must stop early.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|I really liked the book, however it was confusing at times. I read it for a book club and we all had different interpretations of the ending. I thought it was well written and held my interest.

B002CLBJPK|5.0|Loved this movie as a kid and know I get to share it with my kids. I didn't realize it was an extended version and I really enjoy seeing more.

B00A81MV3U|4.0|(Rounded up from 3-1/2 Stars) Spoiler Alert! When I heard it received 8 Academy Award/Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, I thought, oh, it must be life-affirming good; when I heard \\"playbook,\\" I thought, okay, it must be mostly about football; and when I heard about Jennifer Lawrence's Oscar win for Best Actress, I thought, well, her character must get sick in the movie, like Debra Winger in \\"Terms of Endearment.\\" Well, as it turns out, I was wrong on all three accounts, and though not similar (but good in its own right), it certainly is not up on the same level with \\"Terms of Endearment\\" (try watching them back to back). Based on a novel, I never expected to so quickly file it under the category of being a little, dare I say it, sappy (the kicker being the Christmas-lights scene in the street towards the end) with its \\"silver linings\\" and few surprises (like the identity of the letter writer; the letter was typed out, for goodness' sake), only with slight variations in characters you would usually see in movies, and stretched out over no less than 122 minutes! (Did we really need to see that whole \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" subplot?) On the plus side, though, were great acting performances all around (including I'm-not-just-a-pretty-boy Bradley Cooper, Robert DeNiro, and Jacki Weaver, all Oscar-nominated, too), not just by the lovely Lawrence, even while dropping several F-bombs (unnecessary), though it was actually DeNiro who delivered the Oscar-caliber performance, with the best scenes actually not between Lawrence and Cooper but between DeNiro and Cooper, father and son (especially when Dad, through tears, blames himself for his son's issues, seeming to want to make amends in that touching father-and-son scene at the end of the dance competition, when pleading for his son to choose the girl he really loves so that his son can finally find true happiness, with Junior embracing his Dad as if realizing this and forgiving him; their relationship should have been the movie's focal point, even if it wasn't so in the book), with the movie's most redeeming value being its positive portrayal of people with mental health issues as people we all know and love.  Although not quite living up to its Oscar hype, the acting performances themselves make it worth a look.en the movie's focal point, even if it wasn't so in the book), with the movie's most redeeming value being its positive portrayal of people with mental health issues as people we all know and love.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A great read.  Not your usual murder mystery; this one deals with the usually dull topic of a contested will & who will inherit, but it is compelling throughout.  Grisham has not lost his touch.

147676459X|5.0|This book may be too close to reality for some of us.  However the wonderful drawings help to put a face with Allie's (and my own) suffering.  AKA LIFE.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|it was a good movie i really enjoyed watching it i really did,i liked it,it had alot of good acting in it
B005OZE9SA|5.0|We replaced an M-Box Mini with the Scarlett 2i2 for voice over recording. I did not expect an audible difference - but it is actually much more crisp, more reliable, and the headphone amplifier seems much better. The live monitor feature is a nice extra as well, and something the MBox lacks.  It does everything the MBox Mini does, only better - and then some - at a comparable price. The 48V phantom power lets us plug our Neumann TLM103 directly into the Scarlett, and gets it straight into digital-land with no need for a pre-amp getting in the way. The sound is amazing.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Very  enlightening regarding the importance of establishing sound policies in business.  The book takes you through various examples from companies such as Starbucks, Target, NYC Subway System, Hospital Operating Procedures, and others detailing catastrophic results when well thought procedures are  not in place and supported by all levels of management.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|When I first got the game, I was immediately sucked in. It has an easy interface and a simple design. Get this  game! Trust me, you 'll have fun!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, even when I hate it I still love it. Now it's available on kindle ............... ohhhhhhh noooooooooo.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|Wow I'm addicted to this movie. The music along with the theme that people can change no matter the circumstances. i loved the balcony scene &#34;Julie&#34;!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cool because it is challenging and awesome and you get to select a minion  and drafts vector.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I love a book I can't put down, this a book that can read over and over again and  get something different out of it each time.

B008JFUPFI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot though it is not perfect. The CGI aspects of the film are spectacular but they are also the reason I gave the film a four star review instead of a five star rating. I actually enjoyed the storyline and the acting a lot. A top notch cast helps make this film really good.<br /><br />There are tremendous CGI graphics in the movie that really make the film an action packed adventure. Unfortunately we may have arrived at a time where directors are trying to overwhelm the audience with CGI at the expense of enhancing the script and interaction of the characters. This movie could have been reduced by 20 minutes and been just as good but the continuing fight scenes just took over the film.<br /><br />As a child I read the DC comics and truly was a fan of all of the super heroes. Superman was my favorite. The story line follows the comics to some extent and yet it also develops its own new Superman genre. I can accept that and see how they were trying to create an interesting and fast action movie. I liked the film a lot but directors have to learn that every film just doesn't have to have so much action that it detracts from the real story. Tone it down a little bit and it would have been just as good.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Pirate Adventures 2. I Love the game so far! It tells a story (Which is entertaining). Plus therexare all sorts of brain teasing puzzles to work out! The puzzles will give you hints ; if you get stuck on them!<br />I find this game has a little bit of everything! Its not what I was expecting! ( awhich is a good thing!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|This is an entertaining game of puzzles and find the hidden objects or differences. While it is fun it could be a little better with a pan and zoom feature. Some of the photos contain very small objects that can be difficult to find. During the game you go through a journey and you have to:<br /><br />* Solve word puzzles<br /><br />* Find the difference in pictures, The pictures are small with no pan and zoom capability.<br /><br />* Find pairs of objects. The graphics are well done.<br /><br />* Solve word puzzles.<br /><br />The game has text to read to follow the story line. The text of the story is slow and tedious to go through but you can tap the screen to skip over the text and get to the next challenge.<br /><br />I do not like that the game asks you to share your results on Facebook or Twitter.  In addition there are pop ups that ask you to rate the game which is annoying.<br /><br />The saving grace for the game is that the graphics are nicely done and it is a good find the hidden object game and solve the puzzle game. I deducted one star for the lack of the pan and zoom feature and the annoying pop up requests.

B00GME9AJK|2.0|Of course, everyone knows the general story of Jobs as one of the greatest comebacks in the history of business and one of the most influential people in global history in that he single handedly changed the music industry with the iPod, invented the tablet space with the iPad, and changed our social interactions with our dependency on iPhones.  The movie could have focused on the history and the essence of that comeback which leads up to the iPod but the movie gets very diluted without any story arc, love interest or conflict.  It's difficult to get all of the facts from the Walter Isaacscon book, but that should not take away from the key elements necessary for a screenplay.  Basically, Ashton Kutcher, to his credit, delivered a believable performance as Jobs, but the studio should have allowed for a bigger budget because the film necessitated another hour to develop the characters with the timeline chosen.  Additionally, the Director, Joshua Michael Stern, clearly did not have the experience to deliver a top notch film since this was only his third effort.  Such a shame because this could have been a classic film.  Oliver Stone should of had a crack at this movie because he did a tremendous job with the Doors movie by telling a story of fact with character development.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|This CD is perfect for early morning listening, when you're the only one awake in the house and you want to ease your way into the day. Or when you want to engage in some yoga.
B003GK22HA|4.0|Very interesting and learnt a lot about Egypt. It is well written. But sometimes gets a bit slow paced and boring.
B00AAI7B7W|4.0|Watched this again after a gap of twenty years. I had forgotten what a well-constructed and thoughtful movie it is. The horror and special effects are indeed effective, but second to characters and storyline. A story about grace and hope, and an important movie.
159514188X|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is a very intense novel. To begin with, you have to be able to keep up with who’s talking. At times it can be difficult as the author switched from Hannah’s voice to Clay’s. Hannah’s voice was in atilax.  Clay’s voice was in normal text. Even though at times it was hard to keep up, the author did a great job of switching from one voice to the other. It lets you hear from Hannah what went on, then how Clay feels about it. Its almost like an argument.<br /><br />You also have to be able to deal with the pressure. There are many points where you feel very nervous. As Hannah goes through the different stories, you start to feel her pain. As things built up, she became more depressed. She knew she needed help, but was afraid to let people in. Towards the end, she finally was willing to get help from Mr. Porter, but when she asked, she did not receive it.<br /><br />Also while reading this novel you feel Clay’s pressure. As he visits each place Hannah talks about, he feels more, and more guilty.  However, at the same time, Clay feels anger towards Hannah. He tried to help her, yet she was not willing to get his help. Clay really liked Hannah. He even kissed her. But Hannah stayed to herself. On the tapes, she apologized for being this way.  I feel sure Clay wasn’t a negative reason Hannah made the decision she did. Personally, I think Clay’s name was only on the tapes because she wanted to tell him sorry before she took her last breath.<br /><br />As the story goes on, you began to feel sympathy for both Hannah and Clay. Clay becomes emotional while listening to Hannah. You really can’t blame him. Her decision led to pain in Clay’s heart. Clay could’ve helped her. However, personally I didn’t feel anger towards Hannah. I only felt sorry for her. As things built up, she didn’t know how to cope with them. We can’t be mad at her. Everyday she fought a new battle. I just wish she could’ve got help and not made the decision she did.<br /><br /> If I could change things about this novel, there are just a few things I’d do. To begin with, I would start the novel as Hannah being alive, and instead of listening to her talk about what happened on the cassette tapes, the reader could actually read about when the crisis was present. I think this would help create an even more intense novel. Even though it might be too much for some people, it would really make a great story.<br /><br />Another thing I would change is the ending. I would make it where when Hannah went to Mr. Porter as her last resort, he would help her. I would make it where they talked for a long time about all the problems Hannah has, and he would help her. I would also make it where Hannah never committed suicide. Suicide has become such a problem. If I changed the book to where she got help, and changed her mind, maybe it would show the reader that if they’re feeling this, they can get help too.<br /><br />Overall, this is an amazing novel. Intensity is a great element to it. Even though you almost feel Hannah’s pain in your heart, it only makes it that much better. I would recommend this book to any highschooler or adult. I think it would be too much for middle school and under to handle. It’s one of the best books I’ve ever read!
B00FN811SY|5.0|I love it but can't download it I am really disappointed in Kindle for blocking this . It is free and a great app . I tried to download the complete app because I have seen it on other devices but the things that need to be downloaded to just down load this is shameful.
B00DXP7L88|4.0|I am a great fan of Dexter, but the ending of the series left me feeling very uneasy.  I won't go into detail, but I think they took the ending one step too far.  I have the entire series, but I am afraid it will take me a while before I can view it again.
B000SGRONM|5.0|Clever as always.  Great read for the holidays!  If you like Sedaris, you will love some of the stories within.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant is every bit as good as Divergent and Insurgent. I can't wait to see the movies - it's gotta happen because the series is that good. I'd take this series over The Hunger Games - it's consistently better from the beginning of book 1 to the last page of Allegiant!
B003F9G8B8|5.0|This movie compels you to be better with the people around you and the whole world. It's very uplifting thinking that this really happened and could happen again...

B008JFUPK8|5.0|Love the movie when I went to the movie theater.  The blu-ray looks great.  Did a pre-order and it came right on the day they said it would.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|works great with&#34;you tube&#34; and amazon videos without cable from your laptop to the tv. Worth the money and a little bit of time it takes to set up
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Simply put this book is incredible. Read it. God bless America and those amazing people on the front lines who protect her.

B000ICXQU6|1.0|I'd give it zero stars if I could. A great example of how populist thinking is broken - there was no science, no real evidence, no statistics - just a story based on anecdote. No different from witch burning in the past based on random co-incidence, except for the fact that the target is large and is willing to shell out money rather than burn. There was a great back-and-forth on the WSJ on the topic of how wrong this was from beginning to end, creating a heroine out of a sympathetic but ultimately greedy and un-informed activist. (Search for [erin brockovich wsj] or [erin brockovich facts] - salon, the wsj and others have done exposes, but they receive a fraction of the attention of the movie).
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book! Kept me on the edge of my seat and had a great storyline throughout that kept me hooked!

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really enjoyed the first 2 books in this series. This last installment feels rushed. There is little to no time spent in the end giving resolution to the characters lives. It's almost as if the writer just wanted to hurry up an finish it.

I am, however, a multi-tasker who frequently renders video while doing other productivity tasks.<br /><br />This card replaced a 14-month old OEM Asus card that had suddenly started introducing intermittent Windows 7 shutdowns.<br /><br />If you're considering this card, make sure:<br />-you have an adequate power supply (this card has a 150 watt demand, and my 350 OEM PSU was not up to the task of running everything else and this card)<br />-your power supply has an available PCI-e 6-pin power cord (mine had none; so a power supply upgrade became part of this task)<br />-your case is deep enough to accommodate the length of this card (mine did..not through planning, but through dumb luck)<br />-you have adequate clearance to accommodate the height of this card.<br /><br />Installation was trouble free.

1476727651|2.0|**spoilers, grammatical errors, etc below**<br /><br />Yikes... So I just lost all faith in the amazon user rating system.<br /><br />I'm truly mystified at all the five stars reviews. Four I can understand if people enjoy Mr. King's easy-going and accessible (in a good way!) writing style, or feel some sort of loyalty to him for providing decades of entertainment. But five stars? How can a book with an ending this anti-climatic merit the highest possible rating?<br /><br />And I'm glad AA helps people with their alcohol abuse. Whatever works. But this novel is a perfect example of why people in AA are so annoying to be around. They enjoy life without drinking... as long as they can constantly talk about how they aren't drinking. Constantly. We get it AA members, you aren't drinking. We heard you the first 8,000 times.<br /><br />I'm giving this 2 stars because I have trouble finding any redeeming qualities other than Mr. King's seasoned style of writing, and 1.5 stars isn't an option. As other reviewers have noted, the characters are flat, the bad guys aren't scary or impressive in any way, and Dan's rock bottom moment was puzzingly far from a much rockier bottom that any of us could imagine. It took an impressive amount of willpower on my part not to put this book down when the family connection was revealed; that was horribly contrived and unnecessary (seriously... I'm a little proud that I was able to continue after that wretched &#34;plot-twist&#34;)<br /><br />Anyway, the good thing is that all of this misery has motivated me to reread the Shining. Now THAT was a five-star book.
B005CWRB44|5.0|Fantastic! Small, compact and powerful. It is even brighter than what one expects from 170 lumens. I use it all the time. It is also great for photography, to illuminate subjects as a compliment to flash. Highly recommended.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|great actor in a great movie. Movies intense and balanced, where an honest person, unfortunately, turns into a martyr embittered by events. Beautiful music.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|If you like hidden object games, you won't be disappointed.  There's a lot of seemingly meaningless rules, but it is still highly addictive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Game is addicting and the progression get more challenging. Starts out simple and then it becomes strategic. Hard to put down. Can play without spending money every time you pick it up. Free lives at continuous intervals all day!  Love it!!!
B007REV4T8|3.0|Plot was TOO unlikely, even for James Bond. Crazy to take 'M' to the wilds of Scotland with no back-up and it got her killed. Not a patch on Casino Royale.

As always, Grisham keeps his reader involved not only with the intrigue of the plot, but with the complexity if his characters as well.. I found myself hoping that Jake and his entourage will appear in yet another novel....how about it, Mr. Grisham?
B00GME9AJK|5.0|and his story will be a map for others to follow in chasing their dream. A motivating piece of history well cast and acted.
B00GI13VYW|4.0|I was deeply impressed by Jake Bugg's first album, and his seemingly impossibly thorough command of song idioms we associate with times long past -- the usual comparison is early Bob Dylan, but there are even deeper echoes to the singers and songwriters who influenced Dylan and his tribe.<br />&#34;Shangri La&#34; continues that journey, with more songs that drink from that well of folk storytellers but explore bleakly urban landscapes populated with bored, lost kids trying to find meaning in their lives. The musicianship is improved, and the songs and arrangements are more sophisticated. So many of the songs are good -- Pine Trees, Simple Pleasures, There’s A Beast And We All Feed It, What Doesn't Kill You, Messed Up Kids...no standout track like Lightning Bolt or Two Fingers, but engaging and enjoyable nonetheless.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My update was... AWESOME. On my kindle fire hd it works perfect. I really love this game. I was scared when I got the update. But it works fine.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|The best of the Marvel films to cover the origin of one of its original heroes, Captain America lives up to its billing as the First Avenger.  I wonder however how they can reconcile Chris Evans having played Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four a few years earlier.  Hugo Weaving delivers an incredible Red Skull who is part Werner Herzog and part Heinrich Himmler.  What is a shame is that we never get to see Bucky Barnes &#34;suit up&#34; so to speak as Cap's sidekick, and instead we see them together in the beginning of the film with a 4F Steve Rogers which is a hilarious CGI trick worth watching.  Overall required viewing if you plan to make sense of the Tesseract in The Avengers movie.
B00G32TD98|4.0|A little odd and disjointed in places, but an interesting scary story given that it is based (loosely I'm guessing) on supposed true events.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome must have product! I don't have smartTV, so thank you google for bringing &#34;SmartTv&#34; to my TV  for only for 35$.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Do you have to ask?<br />Who in their right mind doesn't love the stones....and Keith is the frosting on the cake!<br />Up close and personal is an understatement, he felt so close I smelled the tobacco on his breath
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Finally a bag that has everything I wanted. It's very roomy and has lots of compartments for lens, flashes...etc. It has zippered areas for cleaning supplies, sd cards or whatever else you need. The inside is nicely padded so your equipment doesn't roll around. It's a nice looking bag.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great book---stunning 1st person tale!  Dealing with counterfeiting, this novel has it all---mystery, realism, horror, humor and suspense.  I can't quit thinking about it and wondering what would happen if it were true (even though it was written many years ago, it is still possible!).  The characters are fresh and true-to-life and develop as the tale unfolds.  Can't wait to read the next one!
1402712367|5.0|&#34;Little Women&#34; is a classic from another age, a family story of a generation of sisters who learn about Life and death as they progress through their daily chores and lessons.  This is a wonderful novel for young girls of the teen years.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Great album! Love all her music. Talented young woman, classy, well spoken, great lyrics. SO glad I bought this album!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It' s fascinating, keeps you in tension from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />The idea interesting, the characters realistic, the story amazing.<br /><br />However, there are some technical oddities: e.g. How can radio waves emanating from a handheld device propagate outside the silo, or, more severe, how can the people inside the silo live without a calendar, therefore ignoring how long they have lived inside it?<br /><br />Nevertheless, as all best sci-fi literature, you forgive these lapses and enjoy the story.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!!!!! Whoever doesn't like this movie knows nothing about good movies<br />Great action and story line. New twist on Hansel and Gretel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You have to get this game....at least check it out!! This is so much fun and a great challenge. Most of the time I am torn between laughing or getting mad. The changing themes are wonderful and all of the challenges offered daily keep me playing everyday. Love it and highly addicted!!!!
B007F0IXD4|5.0|This book is perfect. By that I mean, it is perfect at what it is meant to be, a scary, inspiring short book for kids. I love it.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I read this book because it was a book club pick.  I'm not a fan of non-fiction in the first place; that said, a 3 star rating is a good rating for me.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|Wonderful style and his voice is so recognizable.  Think he will last, like a Dylan or Petty.  Didn't think he should win American Idol,<br />but he has sure proved me wrong.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Love this movie!  Such a great movie, not only for kids, but for big kids like me.  Laughter and love are always better than fear.
B00ADQPB50|2.0|Like other reviewers on the site, I thought Season 1 was pretty decent.<br /><br />This, on the other hand, is a complete pile of garbage.  How many ham-fisted, poorly developed, ludicrous plots can one group of desperate (and very obviously cocaine addled) Hollywood writers tie together?  Lets take a look.  It's about an insane asylum, and and murder, but its also about religion, exorcism, aliens, redemption, feminism, racism.  It's sometimes satirical, but also expects you to be scared.  It's about fame, and maternity.  It's about love too.  It's also about Nazis and genetic engineering.<br /><br />Its paced wrong.  The characters are generally detestable.  It's trashy in all the wrong places.  Its just a bad story told poorly, as if Sunset Boulevard, Sleepaway Camp II and Dude Where's My Car all tried to stage a performance at the MTV Video Awards.  I can't imagine what kind of human would consider this 4-5 star material.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A continuation of Ford county drama. Excellent tale that will keep your attention. Believable characters. Many surprise turns. Dramatic conclusion. Enjoyable read. Grisham scores again.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Great story put together in an exciting way, great visuals, good actors.  I have seen this a few times and it's enjoyable each time.
B005LAII4E|3.0|To be perfectly clear I'm rating the film itself not the Blu-ray release. I viewed the film on a first class plane flight and was shall we say well lubricated during my showing. The cliff notes of the experience are as follows. Channing Tatum gave his normal unexceptional performance while Bruce Willis practically slept through his scenes, which were thankfully short. If you are a fan of Dwayne Johnson this movie is a must see, as its two redeeming features are the fight choreography and Johnson's screen presence. If you are in the mood for a mindless action film and decent Dwayne Johnson vehicle by all means go ahead and watch it. Why you would feel the need to own this film unless you were a GI Joe/Dwayne Johnson fanatic escapes me?
0316223239|5.0|simply one of the best books i've read in a long time.  i finished it the day i started it...just couldn't put it down!
B002TLSSXO|5.0|love these - colorful yet very practical - can use in any pan particularly non-stick cookware - love the colors
0812982622|5.0|Not for the faint hearted, but a fascinating story beautifully written.  Murder mystery, spy/double agent story, sociopolitical study and love story all in one. Exquisite suffering portrayed with a tender hand and a respect for the integrity of the human heart and soul while under unimagined duress. North Korea's 1984.
B00EKQ3YZI|1.0|This cd has very little to do with donna and more to do with inflated egos. What a shame. Donna deserves much better
B003G94BZC|5.0|Filled with excitement, fantasy and lots of laughs.  The Doctor is a man with character, courage and charisma. Never know the outcome of his work.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Not anything like the game offered by apple or on android. You can't get pass level 35 without paying for it. Or it makes you do a challenge  to get to the next level, and you can only do one in a 24 hour period. I am so disappointed.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Reminds me of sixth grade history.  The parts about Lindbergh were most informative. Babe Ruth should never be forgotten about..
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Really awesome movie, beginning to the end the actors and costumes were also phenomenal, I would definitely recommend this movie
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Very good Bond movie. Villain was lame but over all a good movie with the family.Bond does it again. I would recommend it for a family night.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Really enjoyed the story and going back too CLayton county can't wait for the next book from GRisham soon I hope
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Don't like the new version half as well as the old. My iPhone app from the same source is much better.
0060899190|5.0|Awesome book, just like all the others. I love the Post Secret project, it is so inspiring to hear such honesty from strangers.
B004GE15MI|5.0|Two of the best actors of all time make this movie a necessary watch. Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney are amazing!
B000NMW6M0|2.0|It might be advertised as Brad Pitt's best movie, but it's really just junk without much of a plot. It's hard to put the three stories it depicts together, and finally ends in an unsatisfactory manner.
B00003CXPD|5.0|One of the best films I have enjoyed in a long while.  The passion in Billy to dance is outstanding.  And the last 5 minutes of the movie makes me cry every time.
B00GIZO674|5.0|This a great game for someone who likes time management games that consists of food. I would recommend this game for all ages and you can play anytime. I like the new different restaurant settings.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great graphics and action. Also a nice variety of game<br />Highly recommended for a free game.  Words words of wisdom and the morning of them
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This dictionary is a good meaningful dictionary<br /><br />with words I have never heard before but I now heard its a interesting dictionary indeed
B001HC8516|5.0|I wish I had read this book in my 20's.  It might have saved me 11 years of marriage to a man who was &#34;just not into me&#34;.  Now divorced and starting my life over, I don't want to make the same mistake twice.  So now I am going to train my brain to move on and not dwell in the what ifs and maybes if a man shows signs of &#34;he's just not that into you&#34;.  I will pick my pride up, realize I deserve better and move on.  I will recommend this book to all my female friends who are young and never married, older and starting over or unhappily married.  I hope I find my superhero strength to enjoy my alone time instead of wallowing in self pity and misery.  Thank you for this eye opening book.  Men really are simple-minded creatures.
B00ESH04LQ|5.0|Excellent cast, superb acting, Joss Whedon is the William Shakespeare of the 21st century, so it is a match made in heaven.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Today i will give it to my daughter !!!  She  doesnt imagine !!! I want to look at her face !
B00DXPC1U6|4.0|Fair warning, this will contain some spoilers from the 8th season and previous seasons, so proceed at your own risk...<br /><br />I am conflicted about the season because on one hand I think it did very well in explaining the rest of Dexter's back story and introducing Vogel as almost a surrogate mother to him. On the other hand, the end was a very big letdown. I actually really liked the first part of the season, just did not like the direction they took the last handful of episodes. I think the series always had to end with him either dying or everyone finding out exactly who he was and him trying to get away. And while he did not exactly get away without any consequences, the show does end with everyone from his past life thinking he was who they always thought he was.<br /><br />The show always straddled the line between portraying him as a good guy, vigilante and a killer who needed to be put down. It was most compelling when he was just on the brink of being caught for what he did, or when his &#34;other work&#34; came too close to his personal life and put others in danger. Throughout the series really only three people ever found out that he was a killer (who were not already killers themselves). I think the show really almost had to end with everyone becoming aware of that fact, and I personally think the season would have been more compelling if the last few shows were about him having to deal with the repercussions of everybody realizing he was in fact the Bay Harbor Butcher as opposed to taking out one final bad guy.<br /><br />With that said, accepting what they did do with the season and the direction it was taken, I think it was done well overall. From the story with Vogel, taking on an apprentice of sorts, the return of Hanna and fixing his relationship with Deb, were all good stories, and the acting as usual was very good. The one thing I do like about how the series ended is that he did not get to live happily ever after and that his self imposed exile was a pretty miserable looking existence.<br /><br />As for the set itself for those who get the discs. Like the other seasons the episodes are spread across three discs. There is commentary on some episodes and 5 or 6 relatively short behind the scenes features. The first two episodes of the new series Ray Donovan are also included. Nothing major though.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app.Always very helpful.It helps me to plan my day and how to dress my children.I keep it in my favorites and in a seconds notice its at my finger tips.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Imaginative plot with fairly good acting by all. They kept you wondering right up to the end of the movie
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|good game but there is too much luck needed as you get to the higher levels.  I guess you cant blame the developer for trying to sell powerups but some levels are rediculous
B002XXUWMI|3.0|Looking back at it from 2013 its pretty dated in approach. Not something to look at as a classic, but as a time filler.
B00005KAQP|5.0|This old Whoopie Goldberg film is as good as it was when it first hit the big screen.  She's wonderful, as always.  Being part of a Vegas act, with less than a pristine character, she witnesses a murder by a mob member.  The cops want her to testify against them, she hesitates because they would kill her too.  The cops promise to place her under protective disguise and she agrees, only to find herself hidden away in the last place they would look....a convent on the ''lower end'' of town.  At first she fights it all the way, makes many mistakes that shocks Mother Superior, and delights many fellow sisters.  She grows anxious as the weeks pass without an arrest of the mob members.  She wants to leave, Mother feels she is not a good influence at the convent but feels obligated to the local law enforcement so offers Whoopi the chance to stay awhile longer and be responsible for only ONE thing....director of the church choir which is terribly tone deaf.<br /><br />Whoopie is musically inclined and reluctantly accepts, turns the choir into a bee bopping synchronized well choreographed sensation which makes the news all the way to the Pope.  That's all.  The end will surprise you.  This is delightful, and I would recommend it for it's comedy, of course, it's lessons that we could learn from even today.  A good family film.
B004GJXQ20|3.0|I loved the TV series, but this book reminded me that this isn't my genre!<br /><br />Great read if you love the TV series.
1608871452|5.0|This is a weighty coffee table style book for fans. I got it for my sister but as a casual fan of SPN, I flipped through it and read maybe a quarter of it. It is pretty in depth on the show creation and littered throughout the book are photo repros glued but easily removed from the book, envelopes of several photos and mini posters, a replica of Metallicar's air freshener, and a plethora of awesome. Amazon price makes this a must buy for any hardcore fan.<br />It's also cool.that it pretty much 100% confirms Castiel is dressed to tribute John Constantine from DC Comics, who is supposedly getting a show at last and it'll be fun to see how many think his trenchcoat will be a Cas tribute.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|But whoever writes the dialogue should be made to walk the plank. It's a good thing it's actually not necessary to pick up any clues but skipping the conversations, while less painful, turns this into just a puzzle to puzzle game and not any kind of storied game. I just can't deal with the inane banter, personally. It goes on forever.<br /> Asking for reviews every step lost it another star. If those two massive annoyances get fixed it would rate at least a 4 * rating.
B008J2GAKU|3.0|Not bad. I like Snyder's horror stuff and other than the weak Arkham Inmate designs at the beginning (they are awful but on purpose but still bad in execution) the art is great. Snyder on Batman can't really wrap up a story sadly and this arc leads to more stuff, just like his Death of the Family. It's not bad as is but it's not groundbreaking when you realize this book is just an execution of the basic origin of Earth 3 Owlman but he's in Earth Prime or 52 or whatever now.<br />Still the art is good  but there are many better horror Batman yarns (for example Dark Knight, Dark City, which is utterly fantastic).
B005LAJ1O0|1.0|Ugly, awful story. Great cast, purchased because of Jessica Lang, and others in cast but oh my God, why such an awful, gross story content? Scary that this show is so popular because. Even my husband said why did you buy this it is ugly? It should come with a warning. Only watched 1/2 of first episode, could not watch more, Ugh. Hope I can return it!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I am a writer and get confused about marketing a book because there are so many options. John's book let me know what works and what doesn't work. From the knowledge gained by this book, I can now formulate a great marketing plan with much less costs and much more results.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|One of the best android games I've played. The graphics and gameplay are both pretty sweet too. Somewhat challenging. LOVE IT!!
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|The instruments and tone are easy to listen to, but it is the lyrics that are the most intriguing.  It is refreshing to hear songs that do not center around sex, money, or drugs. Lord's album will not disappoint you!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My favorite game of all time!!! Come on...give us a part 2!!! I've beat this one already!! Had to get it on PC and TABLET!!! Highly enjoyable!!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book is probably my least favorite of the 3, but it was still a good book. It upset me when the children and Prim died. If you haven't read the Hunger Games and you need a book to read, read the first book.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I don't really play this game.  I only give lives to those who do play it. My son loves it.
1451683405|1.0|What a joke; and just more proof that the genes of humanity have degenerated to such a clinically unhealthy level that people now think blatant contradictions are considered &#34;logic.&#34;<br /><br />People like Sam Harris, Dawkins etc. are the pioneers of polluting the words like Logic, Rationalism, Reason, oh and Science.
B000VDDDY6|1.0|The original version un-mastered I feel is a much better even with all the original flaws. Picture quality is sharp and quite clear, however, it appears not enough effort went into keeping sound track manageable. Music track can be quite loud often times drowning out character voices. Without a surround sound system watching shows with existing sound mix is extremely annoying. This will be the only season I will purchase, not worth the money for the quality of overall reproduction.
B0001AUAU4|5.0|I love this cd. I'm not too familiar of her music and can't compare it to her other cd's but this one is nice background music. I especially love it in the car after a hectic day. Light and mostly soft. My two year old granddaughter also loves it and always ask me to play it. I am glad I purchased this cd and will be ordering more of her music.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|Its classic french comedy at its best! I watched it 10 times and will never get tired of seeing it again:)
0765350386|5.0|So powerful and compelling, with more tension and suspense than I expected! The romance was even amazing! Though the ending was great, I wish it were a little bit stronger. I can't wait to read more Sanderson!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Really good hidden object game. Lots of different tasks and goals to complete. Only bad thing  is how few rooms you can explore before energy goes completely but it's quite quick to fill up again.
0061660167|3.0|I found this to be sweetly intriguing. I loved the journey and the characters! And the creepy rodent songs were... well, creepy.
0812971825|4.0|Elizabeth Strout has a way of writing that is very different than her contemporaries which I find very inspiring.  I don't think this is her best novel, but nevertheless it is worth reading.  I am looking forward to her most recent novel, but have a pile of books I have not et read, when I finish 3 books I will allow myself to buy another Strout novel.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|Beautiful characters and enchanting descriptions. I easily lost myself in the pages! I only wish I were a little more sold on the solution.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Wish I'd read this year's ago. Loved this book, very insightful. Looking forward to using this knowledge in my future.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a fun game and is not to easy but not to hard I enjoy the game but it can be very frustrating
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast makes NETFLIX an ease to watch, as it streams to my television. I like Chromecast better than a WiFi DVD player.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I thought anyone who played this was a idiot but im addicted lol its AMAZI G drains my battery reaaaly quick though
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I love Veronica Roth and think she is so talented. I love the story being set in Chicago and all the references because I actually can picture things in my head! I didn't LOVE this book, but I couldn't put it down. I do kind of wish that I was completely blown away by the conclusion to the trilogy but oh well.<br /><br />I gave Divergent 4 stars when I first read it but I liked that one more than this one. I don't think I can give this one only 3 stars so maybe I need to up Divergent's rating.<br /><br />I didn't love the changing point of views between Tris and Four. It made the book feel sloppy.<br /><br />**SPOILERS BELOW!!!**<br /><br />Darn spoilers let me know that somebody important died so when Tris bit it, well, I wasn't that surprise. I didn't like it but oh well. I actually think I was more surprised (and saddended) when Uriah didn't make it.<br /><br />I would have liked more explaination of what happened to the Bureau workers and the repercussions of resetting them and what about the government? They just let the reset happen and kept going about their business?<br /><br />Four also got kind of dumb and wimpy. Yes, he had been through a lot but so had Tris and she didn't get stupid.<br /><br />This one was almost too scientific and Erudite for me. Serums and<br />genetics and talky talky. My head hurt.<br /><br />I know that some people only enjoy books with happy endings. That is fine. I don't understand why people have to attack authors because they DIDN'T make it a happy ending and that one ending of a series all of a sudden changes your feelings for the entire series. The end.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|Stupid story. The plot and the story telling was jumping from the two main characters. There was far too much digressing from the story line. It was the worst put together story telling I have read.
B008JFUR10|5.0|If you love Transformers than this is a must see with a little bit of difference included. Storyline and cast doing a great job making this so realistic. Human robots no just machines that gives men the power to control against aliens that try to take over earth, so set in the near future  which has plenty of fabulous action to keep you amused and entertained. I rated this an A grade plus as I did enjoy and with this one kept my attention all the way,  The spills and thrill are there with the suspense added to keep it going full on not knowing what is next,  is just as good. Marvelous entertainment with  feet up and popcorn handy what else do you need, you wont be disappointed but don't expect the greatest.  Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it us the perfect version of temple run but even better because u can race against ur friends. You get to have different characters and differents country to go in. you have different game to play. And that is why it is so amazing.
B008JFUPZI|5.0|Unusual to most with plenty of action and comedy enclosed, one for the library collection which deserves to be mentioned as this movie is not every ones taste, but with the dry comedy thrown in makes it a must see. Cast makes it first class entertainment and the storyline is very different to all others. A one only movie that can be watched several times. With things flying in all directions and so much going on that I rated this an A grade plus for full on entertainment. Being pushed out of the window several floors up is new, by your partner that is, They succeed in all their efforts to make this movie stand out from all others. So now it's time for popcorn and pulling up the chair for a wonderful night of fabulous entertainment, so now relax put your feet up and enjoy!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is such a blast, all the little minions running around getting coins and trying to fight off the mean people! Fun
B000V39KDO|5.0|How could anyone not love this movie. The coloring, set up, plot, and Mr. Butler...all wonderful! Have watched it many times before and will watch it again. Although this story is soooo sad, the movie is sooooo good!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I love it!  I wish I had read this book earlier!  This book a real eye opener on so many things we have in our life now!
1476734941|5.0|The diet has made me feel healthy and I have lost half a stone in weight.  I believe in it so much, that I have bought this book for some friends.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|This is a good Pearl Jam album. Maybe I haven't had it long enough yet to absolutely fall in love with it, but it's good and I'm not at all disappointed. &#34;Future Days&#34; is probably my favorite song on here. It hasn't grabbed me to the extent that some earlier Pearl Jam recordings have, but I'm not ruling that out as I listen to it many more times.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham tells good stories.  This one was a little predictable and sophomoric, but a good pastime read.  Read and enjoy
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I don't own much Paul McCartney solo stuff, but based on the first two singles I heard (&#34;New&#34; and &#34;Queenie-Eye&#34;) I figured I'd like this, and I do. It's something I can pretty much play in its entirety and enjoy. My early favorites are &#34;Alligator&#34; and &#34;I Can Bet.&#34; I consider this a nice confirmation that Paul McCartney still has it. Kudos to him.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love a simple-minded, captivating good read; one that keeps me wanting more. Although this story is as graphic as I've ever read, there is a part of me that wants to learn more about why  Mr. Grey, CEO, is the way he is...what makes him wanting the way he does. I feel sorry for him. I can't wait to read on.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|I felt the author did a superb job describing the battle that wages over any step someone can take towards breaking out of the mold, taking a risk or stepping into the unknown. As a Christian, i believe the war he describes speak of the spiritual enemy, satan and his army that seek to prevent people from breaking into freedom and create resistance to any step of faith. I got a little lost in the Greek mythology and stories in the second half and i wish there were more how tos in this. But he definitely brings to life the war that every creative person faces. You are not crazy, face the resistance enemy and grow!
