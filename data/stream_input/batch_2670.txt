B000S1M9LY|5.0|I never thought I'd find a writer more talented than Updike.  Wallace may be the one.  This amazing novel enriched my life as much as did the last two Rabbit books.  Wallace will never top this book, and shouldn't have to try - he nailed it here.  Infinite Jest is a tour de force that stands alone.  I am looking forward to reading it again, and soon.

B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Looking for a asteroid type shooter game. This has way more depth with nice graphics. And you get a lot of levels with this game. I'm very pleased with this one.  And would recommend it. For me it hit the mark and then some! A lot of bang for 2.00 bucks.

B0062QRTKA|3.0|It's fun, and the interaction is fun. It's challenging, so you don't get totally bored with it. I like more logical games so it is a little to basic, but yet, I will keep it on my kindle for a while yet.

1476734941|4.0|Even though I never tried the diet after I bought the book I certainly thought it was an interesting read. The book is organized well, and really does present the concept of fasting in a way that seems very manageable.  Perhaps one day I will suck it up and try the diet! I have actually lent the book out to a couple of friends who have enjoyed reading as well.

Learning about Eva & Gideon is really fun and following thier intense journey is awesome, I definitely recommend this book, if you like 50 Shades, you will love this book as well. She is a little more headstrong than Anastasia which is refreshing.
0393976041|5.0|About once a year, I re-read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. And about once a year, I fall a little bit more in love with Mr. Darcy. But I fall a lot more in love with Jane Austen's writing. She writes with such facility and wit that I cannot help but envy her talent.

B00DAXXRTA|2.0|HD version took long a time to play. No wonder same cost. But will HD skipped in the future version.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I am a confessed treky so take this with however much salt you need.<br /><br />The third season of STNG is one of my favorites. There are so many good episodes. The blu-ray image quality is so far above the DVD's that I notice odd things. In &#34;Who Watches the Watchers?&#34; the men's costumes were far more colorful than I ever noticed from the DVD's. The color details of those costumes were so small that they just blurred out in the DVD image but they show up clearly in the blu-ray.
B0025WX2YW|4.0|I like this series and the characters, but some episodes can be a little slow. It is good, but not at the top of my watchlist.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Stephanie Meyer put a good book to a great movie! I think you will be pleased on how well Open Road Produced this film. The Twilight series was done by Summit Entertainment.

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I was actually really pleased with this mouse. The finish and feel of the mouse was very nice. It has a great grip and it looks really nice. Having the weights is also a nice touch to accommodate any preference. I had one issue with the mouse that was more to do with me. I have really big hands and I just couldn't get used to the size. I came from a Logitech mx-518 that just broke and fit perfectly in my hand. If the Anker was just a half-inch longer, it probably would have been perfect. Outside of that I would have given it 5 stars!
0385349947|4.0|A very well done book --- looking at all the options open to women and considering all the possible paths.  Very empowering and inclusive.....although clearly intended for those who have serious career interests in mind.  Read this in a family group of women spanning several generations --- 28 years to 69 years ---- and we ALL thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was surprised and delighted that it was so appealing!  Leaning in at 65!
B000F0UV0E|4.0|Wonderful album. I play it often and enjoy it ver much. Of course, great guitar work as well.<br />Good sonic and solid value. (I put the last bit in to meet the minmum word count Amazon imposes)
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I've found Freely to be both a replacement and an upgrade to the retired Google reader.  Its layout is pleasing to the eyes and easy to manipulate on multiple platforms.  I use it on both my Kindle and my phone.  It's easy to use on both.  Get it and enjoy!

B00DBSZJRM|4.0|The movie never tried to be more than it was destined to be, a fantasy fighter. I love how it continued and modified a traditional tale. The flair and action was quite refreshing and the cgi was good. Overall, worth a late night watch if you like action.
0865479410|4.0|The extraordinary theme of this book, backed by the author's excellent elaboration through Stocism, Buddhism, medieval tradition of memento mori, New Age ideas particularly those of Eckhart Tolle, is as follows:-<br /><br />The effort to try to feel happy is often precisely the thing that makes us miserable. And that it is our constant efforts to eliminate the negative - insecurity, uncertainty, failure or sadness - that is what causes us to feel so insecure, anxious, uncertain, or unhappy....an alternative approach, a \\"negative path\\" to happiness, that entailed taking a radically different stance toward those things that most of use spend our lives trying hard to avoid. It involved learning to enjoy uncertainty, embracing insecurity, stop trying to think positive, becoming familiar with failure, even learning to value death. To be truly happy, we might actually need to be willing to experience more negative emotions - or, at the very least, to learn to stop running quite so far from them.<br /><br />As a realist who reads self help books often for motivation and inspiration, I appreciate much the author's strive to tell the other side of the \\"Positive Thinking\\" \\"hypothesis\\". His perspective on Stocism and Buddhism in the first half of the book really opened my mind, which had been far more insightful and interesting than the second one. Pity! In short, readable. Recommended for all self help book lovers, particularly who regard themselves followers of positive thinking.<br /><br />p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.<br />The law of reversed effort, or the backwards law, the notion that in all sorts of contexts, from our personal lives t politics, all this trying to make everything right is a big part of what's wrong. When you try to stay on the surface of the water, you sink; but when you try to sink, you float and that insecurity is the result of trying to be secure. The harder we try with the conscious will to do something, the less we shall succeed. Pg9<br />Part of the problem with positive thinking, and many related approaches to happiness, is exactly this desire to reduce big questions to one size fits all self-help tricks or ten point plans. By contrast, the negative path offers no such single solution. Pg10<br />\\"The precisely counterintuitive error\\": is when we manage to do the worst possible thing, the blunder so outrageous that we think about it in advance and resolve not to let that happen. Pg13<br />Metacognition occurs when thought takes itself as an object. Mainly, it's an extremely useful skill: it is what enables us to recognize when we are being unreasonable, or sliding into depression, or being afflicted by anxiety, and then to do something about it. But when we use metacognitive thoughts directly to try to control our other, every day, object level thoughts, by suppressing images of white bears or replacing gloomy thoughts with happy ones - we run into trouble. When you try not to think of a white bear, you may experience some success in forcing alternative thoughts into your mind. At the same time though, a metacognitive monitoring process will crank into action, to scan your mind for evidence of whether you are succeeding or failing at the task. And this is where things get perilous, because if you try too hard, if you are tired, stressed, depressed, attempting to multi-task, or otherwise suffering from mental load - it will frequently go wrong. The monitoring process will start to occupy more than its fair share of limelight on the cognitive start. It will jump to the forefront of consciousness, and suddenly all you will be able to thin about is white bears, and how badly you rare doing at nothing thinking about them. Pg14-5<br />A person who has resolved to think positive must constantly scan his or her mind for negative thoughts - yet that scanning will draw attention to the presence of negative thoughts. Worse, if the negative thoughts start to predominate, a vicious spiral may kind in, since the failure to think positively may become the trigger for a new stream of self-berating thoughts, about not thinking positive enough. Pg16<br />We think of distress as a one-step procedure;  something in the outside world causes distress in your interior world. In fact, it's a two-step procedure;: between the outside event and the inside emotion is a belief......This is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so. Shakespeare has Hamlet, say, very Stoically indeed. Pg31<br />Judgments are in our power, that our emotions are determined by our judgments, and that we can always step back and ask: \\"Is it other people that bother me? Or the judgment I make about other people?\\" pg31<br />One of the greatest enemies of human happiness is hedonic adaptation - the predictable and frustrating way in which any new source of pleasure we obtain, swiftly gets relegated to the backdrop of our lives. We grow accustomed to it, and so it ceases to deliver so much joy. It follows, then, that regularly reminding yourself that you might lose any f the things you currently enjoy - indeed, that you will definitely lose them all, in the end, when death catches up with you - would reverse the adaptation effect....remind yourself that you love a mortal, something not your own; it has been given to you for the present, nor inseparably nor forever, but like  a fig, or a bunch of grapes a t a fixed seasons of the year.  Pg33<br />As Seneca frequently observes, we habitually act as if our control over the world were much greater than it really is.....And the behavior of other people is even further beyond our control. For most conventional notions of happiness - which consists in making things the way you want them to be - this poses a big problem....The only things we can truly control, the Stoics argue, are our judgments, - what we believe - about our circumstances.  Pg39<br />Premeditation of evils: what's the absolute worst that could happen as  a result of this? Almost always, asking this question will reveal your judgments about the situation to have been exaggerated, and cutting them down to size will vastly increase your chances of replacing distress or annoyance with calm. Pg41<br />To live nonattachedly is to feel impulses, think thoughts, and experience life without becoming hooked by mental narratives about how things should be, or should never be, or should remain forever. The perfectly nonattached Buddhist would be simply, calmly present, and non-judgmentally aware. Pg54<br />The idea of using meditation to make your life better or happier in any conventional sense was a misunderstanding. The point, instead, was to learn  how to stop trying to fix things, to stop being so preoccupied with trying to control one's experience of the world to give up trying to replace unpleasant thoughts and emotions with more pleasant ones, and to see that, through dropping the pursuit of happiness a more profound peach might result. Pg54<br />If you've ever gripped the arms of a dentist's chair, in expectation of imminent agony that never actually arrives, you'll know that a big part of the problem is attachment to thoughts about pain, the fear of its arrival, and the internal struggle to avoid it. Pg65<br />The routines of almost all famous writers, from Charles Darwin to John Grisham, similarly emphasize specific starting times, or number of hours worked, or words written. Such rituals provide a structure to work in, whether or not the feeling of motivation or inspiration happens to be present. The y let people work alongside negative or positive emotions, instead of getting distracted by the effort of cultivating only positive ones. Inspiration is for amateurs, The rest of us just show up and get to work. Pg69<br />Future: The period of time in which our affairs prosper, out friends are true and our happiness is assured. - Ambrose Bierce, The Devil's Dictionary pg75<br />Why are you unhappy? Because 99.9% of everything you think, and of everything you do, is for yourself - and there isn't one. - Wei Wu Wei, Ask the Awakened pg101<br />Imagine, Descartes begins, an evil demon who is determined to paly as many tricks on you as possible - a demon \\"supremely powerful and cunning\\", who has devoted all his efforts to deceiving you. How far could the demon's deceptions go? Don't forget, Descartes points out, that you rely for your  entire understanding of the external world on your fives sense; ....and so in principle everything you think you know about the world might in fact be a breathtakingly detailed and convincing illusion, concocted by the evil demon. Looking out from inside your head, Descartes asks, how could you every be completely certain that \\"the sky, the air, the earth,.....are not merely delusions, traps that the demon has laid for your credulity?....And yet despite all these possibilities for deception, there is exactly one thing and one thing only that cannot possibly be an illusion, Descartes maintains, and that is the fact that you are experiencing all this.......His proposition: \\"I think, therefore I am\\".

If you are a zombie fanatic (like myself) then you will absolutely love and appreciate the artwork and cleverness used with this deck in relation to your traditional tarot cards.

In addition to the book, you may still care to visit [...] to better understand each of the cards outside of the \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" humor provided by this particular deck. You may appreciate their \\"apocalyptical\\" translation of each of the majors and minors. I did!

B002XXNSF6|3.0|I enjoyed Before Sunrise, but the pacing was a bit too slow. Such a chance encounter evokes certain expectations. It was obvious the couple was smitten with one another. A few of the scenes could have been shaved to get to the climax (no pun intended).<br /><br />This movie needed to exist to allow for the next two to blossom, so I would rather give this movie three-and-a-half stars. Unfortunately, that is not an option.

B002XXPNXG|4.0|When I saw the near perfect rating on Rotten Tomatoes for Linklater's Before Midnight, I was intrigued. Fortunately, the movie description quickly notes this is the third movie in a series.<br /><br />I have only seen the Sunrise and Sunset versions so far. Sunset is definitely a bit more my speed, as it focused on dialogue and not scenes. It was great to hear Jesse and Celine's chance encounter didn't have the storybook ending the average viewer would have desired. Yet it was still obvious their one day truly had an impact on their lives.<br /><br />I only gave this four stars, because I'm anticipating near perfection with Before Midnight. I have to save some room for that. Otherwise, I haven't been this impressed with a romance drama in quite some time. Kudos to Linklater!

0307879259|1.0|The Da Vinci Code opens with the murder of Jacques Saunier, the curator of Paris' Louvre museum.  Before he dies, Jacques leaves several clues written in his own blood.  \\"PS, find Robert Langdon\\".  The French Judicial Police believe that Jacques' final act was to identify his murderer, but in reality it was a message to his estranged granddaughter, Sophie Neveu, who Jacques always called Princess Sophie.  It is critical that Sophie learn the truth about her grandfather's murder, and about her own family before it is too late.  At her grandfather's instruction, Sophie enlists the aid of noted symbologist Robert Langdon, who is obviously the prime suspect in Jacques' murder.<br /><br />Together, Robert and Sophie begin to unravel the mystery.  They learn that Jacques was not only a notable French citizen, but also the grand master in a very ancient secret society called the Priory of Sion.  As events unfold they learn that, for thousands of years, the Priory of Sion has been responsible for guarding the location of none other than the Holy Grail.  Oh yeah, and also the royal bloodline of Jesus Christ himself.<br /><br />Robert and Sophie follow Jacques' clues one by one, racing against time, the French Judicial Police, and a crazed religious assassin, until at last Sophie discovers that she has a much larger role to play than she could ever have imagined.  Princess Sophie indeed!<br /><br />Okay, everybody has heard of this one, right?  The Da Vinci Code created quite a stir a few years ago.  Dan Brown makes some pretty bold statements about Jesus and the Christian church, but I think some people forget that this is a work of fiction and nothing more.<br /><br />The first time I listened to this audiobook, I found Brown's story intriguing and compelling.  But it seems that each subsequent listening reveals more elements that just don't make sense.  For instance, much of The Da Vinci Code revolves around Da Vinci's painting The Last Supper.  Brown asserts that because each person seated at the table is pictured with a cup of his own, there really is no true Cup of Christ.  Also because the person to Jesus' right is depicted as a woman, this means that Jesus had a wife.  The arguments are pretty thin.  This is, after all, a painting and not a photograph.  Also, it's not like Da Vinci was AT the last supper sketching it as it happened.<br /><br />On the technical side, Dan  Brown is a decent story-teller.  The pacing of The Da Vinci Code is good; there are some good action scenes and also moments of suspense that will keep you turning pages so to speak.  If you're not the type to nit-pick over details you'll probably enjoy this audiobook.<br /><br />As far as narrator Paul Michael goes, I find no fault.  His reading was not as inspired as some I've heard, but not as dull as others either.  He does pretty decent French accents for the French characters, although I didn't like his British accent for the character of Leigh Teabing.  Overall, not a bad job.  The Canadian born actor is an accomplished audiobook reader and multiple Earphone Award winner.each person seated at the table is pictured with a cup of his own, there really is no true Cup of Christ.

B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Slow. Cheesey. Campy. Boring. Only character you tend to like is the monkey butler. With an \\"Allstar cast\\" and Disney's infinite amount of capital, I really expected better than this. Seemed like they let a producer-in-training take the reigns on this film without any supervision.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|This was so difficult to put down!  Action, drama,and nail biting suspense. Castle knows his stuff and knows how to keep you engrossed.  Way to go!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|loved his first book but this was unbelievable, could not put down this book, I would recommend buying it asap!!!!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome show I can't wait until season 4 it always kept me guessing what next and couldn't wait for next episode
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I have used the product a few times, and it charge my ipod touch 4th Gen fast enough. I have tried it on my an android device too, and no problem. It looks really high quality, and I hope it works at least a few years. It has 18 month warranty,  and their costumer service looks like very responsive. I recommend this device to a friend.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|don't waste your time trying to buy gems... I have as of yet to get gems I purchased or even a second e-mail trying to resolve the problem... game is fun, customer service sucks
B00821OW8K|4.0|This show was kind of a hard sell for me, as I'm not into aliens, but I was pretty impressed. It's very well acted and intelligently written. The cast is spot on and the story moves logically.<br />Quick reference point: I was in the army for 7 years and most of that time was spend deployed or getting ready to deploy, so things like the logistics of moving large amounts of people and gear as well as dealing with an insurgency are very well known to me.<br />My issue with this series is the military aspect of it. The Skitters are terrible soldiers, really bad in fact. They move in small numbers and don't use projectile weapons and are often completely by themselves. They don't make intelligent tactical choices and really seem to only exist to move the story along. Also, the resistance fighters don't do Dale Dye (the famous military advisor) any justice. The humans have fighters and civilians, which doesn't make sense. In a situation like this there are no civilians: you're either part of the fight or a waste of resources and time. If they wanted to fight then they should send their children away somewhere to keep them safe so the adults can fight without the kids being a constant concern. I wouldn't take as much issue with this, but the show seems to use the civilians to create a forced Internal conflict within the group, as &#34;fighters vs civvies.&#34; That wouldn't exist. Also, the humans logistics don't make sense. Everyone (300 people) have military cots, sleeping bags, and personal equipment. The group also has weapons and ammo and medical supplies, not to mention explosives and other equipment. The whole group has 1 car (which has a mounted weapon), 1 pickup truck, and 2 dirt bikes. I've been on plenty of just 2 week long training missions where 30 people need cots and personal equipment and just that takes up at least 1 whole 8'x8'x12' trailer. That's not counting all the medical supplies and mechanical supplies and extra ammunition. The reality is that the vehicles would have the essential gear and people would carry what they could, but that wouldn't be much. Also, how on earth are they feeding all these people? They never show their water supplies or water gathering (which also counts for sanitation) and they send out 1 or 2 people to get food: that wouldn't be enough to feed 8 people for 1 day.<br />The one good credit they have is their Captain Weaver (expertly played by Will Patton) is almost perfect. He is the hard lined commander who makes sacrifices, but he still explained things and listens to his XO and makes compromises.<br />The reason I gave this show 4 stars is because its enjoyable, well written and well acted. I would've given it 5, but the tactics and reality of combat or living in an insurgency make no sense.vehicles would have the essential gear and people would carry what they could, but that wouldn't be much.

1439163146|5.0|All his books are amazing to me so it would be a surprise if this wasn't one. I think it was great.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Its a tommy lee jones movie what more do you need. The plot, the acting the location all together make for an enjoyable two hours.<br />6
B003V5CFV8|4.0|The movie met my expectations. I really enjoyed it. It was filled with realistic scenes and it was well played.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|I love this show. I don't watch CW. Except for this show. I was skeptical about this. Following Smallville, I thought my CW viewing was done. I don't watch sappy, whiny soap opera shows. The premier started out well, but the show got better and deeper. Stephen Amell IS Green Arrow. They call him The Hood. Fine by me. They're going for realism. It doesn't bother me. I love comics and superheroes from Marvel and DC. I don't nitpick everything. It'd have to be something totally out of character or terribly bad for me to complain. In the comics, it's Star City for example. Here it's Starling. I don't care here. Not for this character.  Now don't go changing the name of Batman's city. Know what I mean?  Anyway, the story is good,  the acting is good and the action is awesome. I recommend this show. Especially for fans of superhero movies/shows.
B0082Z447U|2.0|It is a classic that will catch you very fast, but unluckily will make you lose interest chapter by chapter right from the half of the book to the end. I don't really know (I'm sorry for not investigating it) if the estructure of the story is in this way because it was thought for being a serialized novel, but the plain truth is that Lady in white is artificially long. I'd rather read the gapped version, than the original one.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|Takes practice and practice. 3 out of 10 bolttles cut. Hard to keep straight. Might have to go a differnt route next time. Good for the money.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|I  have seen this movie about 4 diff. times, and still am anxious to see it again. Some movies are just like that.
1400052181|5.0|This book is huge but it goes by fast because its so interesting! I would recommend it for anybody who likes to learn about biology history!
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I have seen this movie at least 5 diff. times. Each time is so entertaining. I don't care much for the &#34;bathroom &#34; scene, or the &#34;naked&#34; guy. But, but all in all, the movie was pretty hilarious, and had a family moral to it. The English actor/actresses were outstanding.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's hard to find all clues.  No hints are given.  Stuck on one level and can't proceed to next level.
B004LE7PCM|5.0|Conan Doyle is the best detective writer! I like Sherlock Holmes very much! The cleverest  and harizmatic person in the world.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Would like it to be in a different version and have the search work a little better than scrolling through, but it easy enough and portable...
B009O2XY12|2.0|I have to say that it is kind of a good game. But it isn't quite there yet. I wouldn't have gotten it if it wasn't free. I don't like how you have to be connected to Wi-Fi for the app to work when you want to play it. It could also use some improvement in a few places. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are always connected to WI-FI.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Still too expensive after discounts, it cost me 20 USD for shipping so it added up to 100USD. Its good but not very well worth the money for me.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It's a very good game it has lots of adventure but it's very interesting I wouldn't let your children play this game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The puzzles are fun, not overly long, and fairly clever.  Find myself having a lot of fun with this game.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|can't make head or tail of it, just goes around in circles, loved the movies but game is a disappointment to me
B004HLO8TW|4.0|Biffy Clyro is a great band and I wish I had invested in their music sooner.  They have a unique sound and I find it refreshing amongst everything else produced these days.
B0091REZMW|4.0|really like just relaxing in the evening and playing. just wish hidden objects were a little larger, those of us older players need the objects to be a bit bigger in all the hidden object games, otherwise love the games.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game so much! Had been trying to find a mystery/hidden object game without all the magic, murder, and horror and this is totally it!
B00594XOZU|4.0|The app is good it's just that when u send a message , it takes a long time to deliver . Other than that, it's great.
0143117009|2.0|I read a lot of nonfiction, and this was not good.  A rehash of other work.  Bounces all over the place.
B000005IS1|3.0|im a fan of the mc5 but this album was a little disappointing mainly because of the sound quality. i have to play the cd louder than most but im sure its because this is a live recording. if youre into the mc5 this is a must have album.. i almost bought the vinyl to compare sound but for now this cd will have to do.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|Once again, Dido delivers. We don't hear alot from her and with each long awaited album, She loses nothing in the way she delivers. Maturity continues to grow in her with age and those of us who have grown with her over the years are not disappointed. She is such a mystery in her songs ... she has an ability to keep it that way ... to keep us longing for the next time to hear from her. Beautiful voice, lyrics, production ... no falling short with this gift from one beautiful woman.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|nice debut full length from tame impala.. i would recommend to anyone thats into psych/pop/rock etc.. solid drum beats, catchy basslines, fuzzed out guitars, and endless echoes. this is a fairly new album but you can hear some obvious influences throughout. this is an album i will be listening to all summer and i would definately recommend it if youre looking for something new to listen to. a new spin on a classic rock sound. i am happy with this purchase overall..
B00BUT5I84|5.0|After the last album, you had to wonder ... could they do it again? They have. Conceptually brilliant, this album kicks off strong and holds the ears where they are needed. This is a rare quality rock album that connects nicely with their first effort. I'm imagining it will sleep for a while like the last album and then will find its way into most collections. The end of the album sets it up beautifully for part 3. Turn up the volume with the first listen.
B0000067L2|5.0|this album is a must have for any cream fan or even someone listening to them for the first time. solid 3 piece band with jack bruce on bass/vocals, eric clapton on guitar, and ginger baker on drums.. straight through album starting with strange brew followed by sunshine of your love and my favorite track world of pain.. classic psych/blues/rock that i would recommend to anyone.. not a fan of the last track but 10/11 isnt bad at all. im happy with this purchase overall and now ive been searching for it on vinyl.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Well written and very well acted, The Notebook will endure for a very long time! Excellent entertainment with a bit of education about dimensia and ther heartbreak of memory loss.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|this is probably my favorite beatles album.. a must have for any beatles fan. a couple of the highlights for me are taxman and im only sleeping. overall im happy with this purchase.
B001GKJ2DY|3.0|The plot of Momma Mia! is cheesy, but if you are an ABBA fan the movie is worth the price; a few of the performances are cute and entertaining!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It will keep you guessing. Every floor is challenging and will keep you engaged without getting frustrated. I could play all day. This is a great game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Nice with graphics I initially just downloaded to see what it was like but I think I'll keep and I don't think my grandson is going to let me remove it.
B0021L8V0M|2.0|This is a slow action flick not worth viewing.<br /><br />1. The stunts and fight scenes are really sped up to attempt to make the star seem able to leap tall buildings when actually she is way past her action prime. The had to use doubles the majority of the time to make her seem athletic.<br /><br />2. There's plenty of boredom here, and I felt the plot was not even close to being plausible. It was hard to stay interested. The freeway truck jumping scenes were hysterical. Salt's slow moving bode was able to leap far distances which made the scenes so laughable.<br /><br />3. The acting is average, and the characters, especially Angelina Jolie, show a shallow depth. It could have ended much sooner and that would have helped over all.<br /><br />I'd definitely would not recommend seeing this movie.
B004GKMV16|5.0|What a wonderful story teller Edward Rutherfurd is.  He really does draw you in.  And I thought Sarem was the best read ever - until London.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Christopher Tookey's review of World War Z the movie made me decide two things simultaneously: I did not want to spend £20 on going to see the film, but I did want to read the book. Having done so, I'm very glad I did.<br /><br />The book takes the simple concept of \\"a plague of zombies\\", and tries to tell the story of a modern, global human struggle to first survive and then fight back and retake the world. To do this the author, Max Brooks, adopts the unusual but highly effective device of a series of interviews with key witnesses: soldiers, survivors, leaders, administrators and political or social commentators.<br /><br />The book is as much about the socio-economic upheaval of such a happening as it is about how zombies behave. Given the concept of \\"flesh eating zombie\\", the emerging story then reflects a very modern understanding of virology, military capabilities, human behaviour and geopolitics.<br /><br />The interview-based structure really resonated with me, although initially I was slightly puzzled why. Then the penny dropped. This is \\"The World at War\\", adapted for science fiction. I am a great fan of that 1970s epic documentary,  told largely through interviews with soldiers, survivors, leaders... The author doesn't explicitly acknowledge that influence, but once you see it, it's obvious.<br /><br />I haven't seen the film yet, but based on the trailer and reviews it sounds like the screenwriters have thrown away this wonderful structure in favour of a much more simplistic linear narrative focused on a few central characters. If so, that's an enormous shame.<br /><br />For an intelligent, inspiring tale which will keep you turning the pages you won't do much better.
B00354YA2M|5.0|I thought I had a pretty good grasp on the land I was born in.  But it took an American to teach me so much more.  This book should be carried as a travel reference while on holiday for places to see and explains the history too.
0345803493|2.0|Absolutely stupid and repetitious. Maybe a teenager could get a thrill out of it. As for me it was not even good &#34;off colored.&#34;
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It worked as suspected. I really was after something that would tell how much time I had left with a certain amount of battery. I'm pleased.
B001QE9WEO|4.0|If you liked &#34;Return of the Living Dead,&#34; you will definitely appreciate &#34;Return of the Living Dead 2.&#34;  I can't say the same for the sequels which followed, but that's a subject for another day.  &#34;RLD2&#34; operates under the same premise as &#34;RLD,&#34; that a secret gas developed by the army reanimates dead people.  In both films, a barrel of the stuff gets misplaced and the gas accidentally gets released, being conveniently soaked into cemetery grounds by a heavy rain.  April showers may bring May flowers, but this tainted rain brings up those who previously pushed up daisies.  Interestingly, two of the main actors from &#34;RLD&#34; return in this sequel, although playing different characters.  As in the original, the zombies want to eat your brain.  The original &#34;RLD&#34; disclosed that the brain-eating was the only way the zombies could dull the pain of being dead.  This sequel doesn't go into such analysis; it just pops out zombies and challenges the main characters to survive.  There are numerous clever moments, such as a zombie crawling out of his grave, who keeps getting stepped on by other zombies.  One of the distinguishing features of this film is that the zombies CANNOT be killed by shooting them in the head.  Fortunately, the humans find another solution.  The ending is much more upbeat than the original &#34;RLD.&#34;  Also, the original had some nudity.  The sequel just has gore.  And the cute Suzanne Snyder.  The only meaningful special feature is audio commentary.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Thai game is funny and entertaining. It is a game I would recommend to anyone no matter how old. I say get this FREE fun game NOW!!!
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|For you Kindle Fire HD users complaining about screen orientation all you need to do is lock your screen ( agreed, you shouldn't have to ) and the game works fine. - Pull down top menu - far left option locks screen - problem solved.
B005FDWM6M|5.0|Very family-friendly and engaging movie for my 7 and 10 year old.  Only part is a war scene, which lasted for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, and because it is short, it did not register more than 1 question from the 7 year old through the movie.  The girls are so engrossed emotionally with the rest of the movie that the war scene was long forgotten.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I do like it, though am still unable to figure out how to delete a location even after consulting a few blogs and FAQ. Wish it wasn't running all the time, but but I guess it's not noticeably draining battery. Four stars if not for the lack of a simple 'x ' near location to delete it
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Overall I liked this book a lot - not as much as the previous 2, but still interesting. The plot weaves together various character's stories, and one did not fit as neatly as the others. However, I enjoyed the book.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Though I like puzzles, I thought Sudoku was a math based game, so never gave it a chance. It's fun!  I like the size of it, it's easy to touch and see numbers, and I like the way it erases the pencil marks when a number is selected. There are several puzzles and difficulty levels to choose from. I'm fine with the first, Very Easy, level so I can't imagine the top level, I think it's called Maniacal or something...WAH!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I resisted watching this show for several years.  Just sounded like a soap opera to me.  I did not know how well done a soap opera it would be!  Thoroughly engaging, characterization fascinating, this is a worthwhile show.  Just sorry the 3rd season is over and we must wait for the 4th!  Further, the time period in history is one that was sadly lacking in my historical learning.  Not any more.  The show spurred me on to do research and to read period novels (I recommend Inspector Ian Rutledge and Maizie Dobbs novels) about the time period; I had no idea what a devastating time was had during the WWI until I did my research.  And then the awful 'flu!  It was a difficult time had by all.  The Roaring '20's was not to my knowledge either; must read F. Scott Fitzgerald...
B004UHL9EK|4.0|it does what it's suppose to. doesn't do anything more, doesn't do anything less. it is exactly what you'd expect.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I recently rewatched all of Season 1 and Season 2 of GoT in anticipation of Season 3 and I was once again struck by how engrossing Season 1 is, how &#34;transitional&#34; Season 2 is, and then I watched Season 3 and understood why so much &#34;set up&#34; had to happen in Season 2. The production values are excellent as always, but this is not a season I would watch again simply for the sake of watching something interesting.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I'm so glad CBS has made this show available for online streaming! I watched the first three seasons on Roku using my Prime account.
B009B2VBWE|1.0|There was no warning to let one know how much country was involved in this CD. It has been returned.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great tool.  Very simple and accurate and easy to use. I like the size too ... it is easy to read without my reading glasses.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|What do they do? I used to love this app and an hour after last viewing, it all changed! Do not like and find it difficult to find what I want. Have uninstalled from my Kindle Fire and will find another weather app.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I love it. it helps me sleep at night because I adore the sound of rain while I sleep. And I adore how I can costumize the certain sounds I can hear through the rain. Plus, you can hear other things too. A well put together and fantastic app.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Re kindle version<br />Just wow...what once was easy &amp; elegant, simple yet powerful, now looks goofy &amp; light. I look to Weather Channel for authoritative information. This app no longer conveys that image. Looking for an alternative.
159562015X|5.0|Wow - I think I should have purchased 3 more.  We have placed multiple orders for this book as gifts and so far - everyone has loved it!!  The book contains a code for your own personal assessment - which is a gift that just keeps giving.<br />I highly recommend this for HS students looking to go off to college to understand their strengths, I also recommend this for parents to understand their strengths and help utilize those for family interactions.  Great Book - great strengths finder quiz online - learned about it at U of MN freshman orientation for our college student and have passed it on since.<br /><br />I only wish I could purchase 1 book with multiple codes - a family really only needs one book and the ability to test all family members.<br />Better for the environment and helps keep the clutter down.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|DVDs look good, 2 ep. per disk.  Lots of nudity.  We learn to hate the lanisters early. Winter is coming?
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|does not load on kindle fire!!!!!! my kindle froze!!!! don't even chance it because if you have a kindle fire it will most likely freeze! I was so mad; it looked so fun...however it did not load!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Pros:These headphones are very good at noise canceling. Super sound quality.<br /><br />Cons:They are a little heavy in weight<br /><br />Overall: I am very happy with them.
0756686970|5.0|We got this book for my 5 (at the time 4) year old son. Like his Dad he loves anything Star Wars, he LOVES this book. He loves learning about all the characters. It has become a nightly thing that my husband will read a couple of characters to him! Since he also has a lot of Star Wars lego sets, he is now able to name most of the characters he has and he also includes a little fact about them :-). Great book for any Start Wars fans.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Slow start, but drew me in towards the middle when the action picked up. Outcome was predictable but was fun reading about how they got there. Plan to read book 2
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|After reading several not so great dragon shifter books I was reluctant to try another one. I'm very glad I did. This was a great book.<br /><br />Pia Giovanni, is half human, half Wyr. Her mother has always kept her hidden from other Wyrkind. She has been told to always stay below the radar and to never draw attention to herself.<br /><br />She does an exceptional job of hiding until her ex-boyfriend blackmails her to steal something from the scariest of all the Wyrkind. The only full blooded dragon left. Dragos Cuelebre.<br /><br />Using her natural talents and a charm that has been given to her, Pia manages to find her way into Drago's hidden lair.<br /><br />Not only does she have one very mad dragon after her, she is pretty sure her ex is involved with the Dark Fae King. And now that he knows what she is capable of doing he wants her for himself.<br /><br />Now she is on the run. She knows when Dragos finds her he will kill her. No one steals from a dragon. She's not sure what will happen if the Fae King finds her, but she knows it will not be good.<br /><br />Fortunately, the dragon is the first to find her. Dragos first thought is to punish her for breaching his wards and locks to take from him. But his thoughts soon change when he catches his first glimpse of Pia. Then he catches her scent.  He finds her interesting. Interesting is different. And suddenly for the first time in a very, very long time he finds he is not bored. He's intrigued.<br /><br />He decides to spare her life. And together they make their way from where Pia has been hiding in North Carolina, back to New York. It's slow going since Dragos has been injured and cannot shift.<br /><br />Along the way they develop a love/hate type of relationship. Dragos is very much the alpha male. He's used to being in charge and giving orders. And having them obeyed. Pia is no ones property, and refuses to be ordered around by the surely dragon. They cant seem to stop fighting but at the same time they are finding it hard to fight the attraction they have for each other.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. The writing was great, I fell in love with the characters early on. There was plenty of action, and Wyr drama to keep things interesting and moving forward. It was also very funny in places. I look forward to reading the next book.finding it hard to fight the attraction they have for each other.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.

B008602KQI|2.0|This is the third book to film combo i watach and I dont like it. It wasn't terrible, but it lacked emotion. Narration would have made this film better. We don't know what Catniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is thinking, feeling, planning etc. Narration is a must, or should be when transferring a book into a film, because 70% of the book is all what the main charactor is thinking, by removing what she thinks from the film you are leaving out a major part of the story. On top of leaving out first person narration, most of the dialogue has been changed, some left out even parts of the story was changed.<br /><br />Example Rue, in the book you felt a connection between her and Katniss. Rue taught her some things about plants and berries. That was left out. The developing romance between katniss and Peeta, the kisses, the trying to convince the viewers that love was blossoming....left out. You get a very sedated love story. The final battle was even changed...well parts of it.<br /><br />This is why authors don't sell the story for $10 They film makers ruin the book so much that only a hefty price tag will let the author feel good about their book being destoryed.
B003UESJF6|4.0|For a 3 year old granddaughter that knew I would buy it for her.  We watched it together, it was cute. I love Will Ferrell and Tina Fey.  Of course it may not be 100% for children, but she and her big sister loved it!

B001QKSWOE|4.0|Enjoyed this in between the numbers book more than any of the others. Made me laugh out loud. Loved the monkey and, as always, Lula.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Right now I think its the BEST thing ever.  I have the Kindle Fire HD and wanted to be able to use it to run an HDMI cable from it to my TV so that I could watch the Big Brother Live Feeds on a big screen and not have to tie up my computer.  To watch the show I needed Adobe Flash but was not able to with the Kindle and the ES File Explorer made it possible to enjoy a great summer of entertainment.  I am sure I will have many other uses for it.  I highly reccomend the ES File Explorer.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Even though this was not a comedy it had several very funny parts to it. Always have thought that Arnold was a natural at comedy.<br />I thought the action scenes were very well done but really this was a movie about Arnold killing thugs and making us laugh while he was doing it. I will buy the DVD and recommend it to all Arnold fans
0446580848|3.0|The plot was good, but the execution of the story was more like he HAD to write a sequel, than he wanted to. TOO MANY explanations of everything. Usually I can't put his books down and read them in a day or two. This one took a couple of weeks.<br />But you have to read it to keep in line with the character, in case he writes another one that is more like the previous John Corey books. Please!
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I've loved all of the booksin this series and have been dying find  out more  about Kaleb  - this book  definitely delivers!!! Couldn't put this story away without reading every page!!  Of course now I'm hanging for the next book!!!

B004TTMYQG|1.0|No way to see the various calendars under my account, which is a huge disappointment given the cost of this app.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|This soundtrack is really fun, bringing back all of the excitement and play of the movie, which I really enjoyed.
B000YAA68C|3.0|I enjoyed this movie because I had just visited Ireland, and I was able re-live all the memories of walking through the countryside. The story line of the movie starts out well, but it seems the plot changes to a sad one so quickly. The flashbacks of how the couple met is helpful but doesn't explain how the story ends. It seems unrealistic for the twists and turns that the main character has to go through to finally appreciate what she already had - her family.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|AT is a good brand this produces surprisingly good sound on video produced using a small handheld camcorder. Good stuff.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It was a wonderful slice of life into the past which the average person can't even imagine. It should be a history lesson to all of us.
B003K16P3M|2.0|I had anticipated reading this book and thought it was going to be great.  I saw the cover and read the back thought it sounded wonderful.  I encouraged a 10 year old girl to read it and I was surprised when she said it was only Ok!  Well I didn't even think it was that great.  The story involves a girl named Katsa who is a Graceling and learning to fight.  A boy name Po is learning the same things she is and they fall in love.  The story is somewhat similar to<br />The Hunger Games which led me to wonder what came first.  This story is less dark and for a younger audience.  This book is first in a series and I don't think I will continue to read any of them.  One of my complaints was the silly dialog among the characters which seemed made to fill a page rather than serving to propel the story forward or add to story in any way.  Boring!
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|Ok so usually before I buy an app on my kindle I read the reviews first. If it costs money I will only buy it if there are good reviews. If it's free I still look at the reviews just in case it is not worth getting. This time I wanted to test out this app because some people had no problem with it while others complained it kept flipping. I read one that did not understand why people were complaining about if flipping because they had no problems. Knowing my kindle, usually on other apps if people have a problem with it my kindle never does. It's always been able to get in the other apps and play normally. Not this time however, because the minute I started the game flipped over. I rotated it 180 degrees and it paused for a minute then rotated again always upside down for me. After a while, I decided to delete it reload it and try again. It did the same thing. I guess some people have the glitch while some do not but this is the first time an app has acted up on me. Anyway if you are looking towards buying this app I would suggest experimenting. If it flips for you, you can always delete it. Really this seemed like a fun game though and its a bummer that it's messed up.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Wow, this whole story is impressive, and the movie is engrossing and interesting.  It was well-played and realistic.  She grew up at a very difficult time, never mind the pressure in school to not be different (as she was and is), but the pressure of the times and how women were perceived and treated.  She did remarkable things, even with the prejudice.  No doubt a loving persistent supportive mother and a couple other key support figures factored into her success--but she had extraordinary drive and intelligence.  she brought new learning to autism, to better understand these children and adults--who are often institutionalized, even high functioning.  But also the cattle and cattle industry.  Huge astounding achievements from this lady.  Clair Danes did a great job of playing--and it all looked and felt as real as it was.  I read the book too, --one of many--and it was just as compelling--I bought the audio book, not the hard book (Commute time).  It was also engaging.  I know someone with high functioning autism in my family and he's not as extreme as Temple Grandin, but it just what each person can achieve if we treat them as whole different people.  But we don't usually.  They are made fun of, put on a shelf and not given the chance to bloom and contribute to the full extent of their capabilities.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|This is one of the most wonderful books ever written in history. Everyone should read this book if they want to read<br />a well told story. I love old stories, because somehow you would feel like you knew how this book would end, but would<br />want to continue reading to make sure. Loved this story from when I first heard of it. had to get my own copy on Kindle. I have a<br />hard back, a paper back, and I hope one day my niece will pick the book up and read such a great book.
B006GKHE6G|4.0|The game was so good that i can barely put it down and that it has great graphics and fast boats and its also exciting at the same time. I could play this game for hours!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion. it is the best game ever. I hope that they make a second minon rush. by by.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The story of the family and the household staff is fascinating.  I was completely drawn in by the characters and events.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Season two was not as great as season one, however season three was able to bring some excitement back to the show. I loved season 1 and 3, can hardly wait for season 4.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book and I really hope that more people are able to read it and fall in love with it. I can't believe how invested I was with this book... It made me laugh and it made me cry. Gus and Hazel shared true love and it was amazing to see their story develop together. I really hope that this becomes a movie so I came watch it over And over again, much like how I will be reading this book over and over again.
B00274EYKY|5.0|I AM NOT GOING TO WRITE A NOVEL, BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THERE HAVE BEEN MANY ACTORS IN COMEBACK MOVIES. SOME GOOD SOME NOT SO GOOD. BUT THIS ONE MOVIE, THIS ONE AND ONLY MOVIE IS IN MY OPINION THE GREATEST COMEBACK MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MICKEY ROURKE GAVE EVERY OUNCE OF HIS BEING INTO THIS MOVIE! HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST GIFTED ACTORS TO WALK THE EARTH AND ALWAYS WILL BE. IF THERE IS A MOVIE EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT IS THIS ONE. I COULD WATCH THIS MOVIE EVERY DAY AND NEVER BE TIRED OF IT. A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE &#60;3
1439153663|4.0|I enjoyed The Kitchen House, but the critiques are worth heeding. The story itself was engaging, but the writing left a lot to be desired. The telling versus showing was particularly problematic. My biggest complaint is that the story was disjointed, and while there were two narrators, the narration from Belle's perspective was limited, and I did not feel that I had as firm of an understanding of her character. The novel was fairly predictable, and for that reason, I enjoyed the first half much more than I enjoyed the second. The Kitchen House is definitely a good book, but I felt that something was missing that would elevate it to a great book.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Nothing to get too excited about in this one. Obviously you don't watch it for character development and at this point in the series there is little that becomes a surprise. The acting was obviously much better in previous versions making this the worst one in the series. But it's still a fun watch.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|A really fun app which I have no practical use for.  It is fun with soothing qualities, something to get you through the wait at the car wash or Dr's office.  Someone with artistic abilities would enjoy making art, but the rest of us minions will just scribble to pass time. It's like etch-o-sketch in color with FLOW. You make it, you say aah, then you erase it and move on.
B007WDPPK8|5.0|This is a great book for beginner to advanced knitters that would like to learn how to knit in the round or would like to fine tune their skills.  One of the problems that I have with knitting in the round is the initial joining of the work to make it round.  This book gives great advice that I haven't seen in other knitting books on how to make a clean professional looking join.  It also has great sections on how to turn a piece that is knitted flat, i.e. a sweater into a circular pattern.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in trying circular knitting or who wants to make their circular knitting better.  This is a great easy to understand book!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is like two books in one; the first is set in an Irish Catholic orphanage , the second in an Irish village. I really wasn't prepared for the former....tough and unsettling to read. The later  revolves arond  village life and evolving releationships and displays McKenna's ability to set her characters so you can practically see them. Some of the detaileds are so funny I literally laughed till I cried. The title is...perfect!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|For some reason my DVR missed this episode it was great to be able to get it hee. Thank you
034553056X|5.0|Not only was the book a fun read but the service was excellent, keep up the good work!  Hope to do business again.
B004GE81CK|5.0|The whole album is beautiful, bee gees at their best!, HOLIDAY, NEW YOUR MINER DISASTER 1941, TO LOVE SOMEBODY, and I CAN'T SEE NOBODY are magnificent!.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The story is exceptionally well written supported by its interesting structure. Keeps the reader riveted and involved in the characters. It is a wonderful read.
B0063TX06I|5.0|Nights on Broadway and Come on over, are the prettiest to me.  They sound beautiful, and of course how to forgett Fanny be tender !
B008LY9AWG|3.0|While this trilogy of stories was a good offering by Michael Connelly, I missed Harry Bosch very much.  Can't get enough Harry Bosch.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|good movie. liked the change from current to flashback. great movie. The acting was very good. Musical score excellent. Overall great
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Thanks for more Harry Bosch.  I love the character so much and cannot get enough of him.  If you are a Harry Bosch fan you will love this offering.
1857885082|5.0|Kate Fox is English and in her interpretation of the English, I learnt a bit more about myself and the reasons I behave as i do. otherwise hilarious in some parts, I love the &#34; different kind of leaves&#34;  on the tracks, when railways were disrupted by these.
B000JLSLZQ|3.0|The film is brilliant but aspect ratio is incorrect. It is NOT 2.2:1 but 2.4:1  which is important to me. If you don't care then OK
B000MD7OKY|5.0|A wonderful show directed by Hitchcock. You can't go wrong with Grace Kelly and Carey Grant.  This is one of my favorite old time movies.
0140143505|5.0|I loved re-reading a book I had read years ago. It was better then I remembered it.<br /><br />A great reminder of how much the world has changed. I wonder if this could have happened today?
0375869026|4.0|I loved the book, as did the children with whom I work.  However, this is most definitely not a book for ages 6-8, unless one considers a character's musings about her breast size development appropriate for first, second and third graders.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Love, love, love this book. I bought it as a summer read and it did me in, finished it in a day. There are not enough stars for this book. Jaime McGuire did an amazing job, and half my office is reading it now. Because of this book I was inspired to read more. Love bad boy Travis & his love and desire for pigeon. Best book I have ever read. I never wanted it to end. I hope the upcoming movie does it justice.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to love this app. I used it to not only check my own weather but the weather in other places I was interested in. It was easy to use. Easy on the eyes. Perfect. Now I have an update I had no choice in as it was done automatically. Now I can barely read it. It is full of cluttered pictures. It is User unfriendly. I have to enter the locations of other places manually every time I want to check them instead of going back and forth easily with one click. I hate the update. After using this for the last 2 years I will now be looking for a different weather app. Thanks weather channel for turning one of the best apps into a piece of crap.
B00873GRU4|4.0|this was a great post-apocolyptic read from a new author.  I will definitely be reading his others in this trilogy
B00CWV8X04|2.0|Plot got convoluted at times and just didn't hold my interest.  Acting is a bit cheesy at parts as well.
B008X8QCTO|1.0|I normally don't read the reviews for games like this, but I def wish I did this time. Very disappointed to have to pay more in the middle of the game and downloading was nearly impossible. I wish I could rate it 0 stars!
B001609SQA|5.0|This is my favorite Alien movie!  Everything is fast and clean with plenty of action and suspense! I may be biased because I grew up with this movie but I highly recommend it.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Loved it. I have only in the last year become a big fan and enjoy the entire cd. Will be getting more by her.
B000QE1U9K|2.0|This is BY FAR the worst of the Alien series.  The plot is poorly put together and hard to even follow.  I do not recommend it, even if you're watching the whole series.  Stick with Alien and Aliens.  Then stop.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Zombie Fest...<br />Love this show! I will watch it more than once. The 'click to own it' option is so quick and easy so I don't have to wait to buy each episode. Thanks Amazon!
0061906220|5.0|The grandchildren enjoyed yet another one of Pete the Cat books.  I love my White Shoes and also enjoyed singing along with the story line.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Jane Austin movies and other period-pieces, but have exhausted the lot of them. How nice it is that Masterpiece Classic is doing such a superb job with each and every detail in Downton Abbey! Thanks, Amazon for having all the best shows!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It was a really good book!! I can't wait for the forth book to come out. The books don't come out fast enough for me.
B005HSGB6W|1.0|I read this book because my 14 year old son had to read it for the summer.  He is a non reader, so I thought if I read them as well, I could help him understand the books he had to read.  A Clockwork Orange is by far the worst book I have read and actually finished.  The main character, Alex, is so un likable, I really didn't care what happened to him.  I didn't want to know anything about him, how his actions propelled him into the situation, or if he would come out a better person.  I had no desire to know anything about such an awful person.  The entire book painted the world such a hopeless place.  I don't know about Europe, but I still hold out that America is not this bad, despite the picture that the current media paints.  And I don't want to read a book that has people that I don't desire to care about.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|The game is really fun, but when i was in rio when everybody went to tokyo and miami, i was stuck in rio. Not until paris did i get off rio, but to do it i had to delete the whole game and lose everything. Becareful when when you buy this game.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Definitely a flashlight under the blankets read till you drop series - concentrate on the sweeping story and not on the minutiae of &#34;who is who&#34; and all will become clear...and wonderful - a ripping yarn!!!!!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|First half was very suspenseful and very well-written. Interest and suspense petered out towards the end... Does make you think about whether you REALLY know the person you married!
B0063GORYU|4.0|A solid spider. Clean interface and decent options with crisp graphics that are easier on the eyes than others.<br />This is the only version of spider I play on all my mobile devices.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Addictive and fun game. Great to play. Wish I had more time to play this addictive game. Must say I cant get enough of this game its amazing.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|An easy read, with an interesting insight in Bombay and the Indian psyche. Too long, and exaggerated/fanciful autobiography, but entertaining
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|My husband loves this CD plays it a lot !!! He has copied it on everything he can and takes it with him every where.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|It's like cod, control is a little difficult to handle at first. I got the hang of it. I got the game for a buck. Well worth it.
037571457X|5.0|Young Marjane is a lovable child in an Iranian family with more Western ideals than the Islamic fundamentalists running the country. The graphic memoir is poignant and darkly comedic. It covers the time of the war with Irag and the Islamic Revolution, which needless be said, is a difficult subject to bring levity to, and yet Marjane Satrapi does just that.
B007Y36K46|4.0|As a fan of the books, I really enjoyed this movie.  It's not perfect, and it's not totally true to the book.  But it's true to the spirit of the book.  It's fun, exciting, and funny in all the right ways.
0061730335|4.0|I had to read this book once William's story was blogged on every site on the Web. I was fascinated that he brought such improvement to his family with just a single electric bulb. This book really highlights so much of what I take for granted in my comfortable suburban life.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case is NOT LIFEPROOF!!!!!  Okay so my friend JUST got her Lifeproof case and she accidentally dropped it and the back of her screen SHATTERED!!!

B000AP04FG|4.0|This is one of the better films I have seen in this generation. The movie has a lot of action and some action love sceans that mad me laugh. The special effects were not over board just right. The actors were on their game they really made the movie enjoyble..
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I bought this to use with my laptop.<br /><br />It's a little bigger than I was expecting, but it does everything I need it too.
B003DT194G|5.0|this movie from beginning to end was worth watching .I have seen many westerns in my time but this one has it all action,best actors.Henery fonda really plays a real mean part van cleef,charles bronson I wish they still had good actors today like years ago.This movie is high above any western made today. The new dejango was a joke compared to this move,the older westerns are still the best well why not they had good actors in them not like today....
B005JS7VTQ|5.0|The best package of music for fans of the Boys....The Doobie Bros are the local boys, that came on with a musical expression that all of us could relate to. These 4 CD's are really all there is to get you hooked on the sound that became the northern California rock sound. I would recommend this to all music lovers, especially locals of the California music scene.
B00821OX98|5.0|Ran across it accidently looking for E.T for my daughter. Now I am hooked very exciting and easy to get sucked into
B0018PH3L0|5.0|A truly great western. Both Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones were perfect true-to-life cowboys. Plot was long but never tedious, with a resolute pace. Fairly violent, enough for gritty realism, but not gratuitous. Good characterizations, cast, direction and of course the expansive western scenery. What more can you ask?
B00555X8OA|4.0|This work gives one pause, making each of us realize how our decisions are inherently subject to unreliability. Most importantly it gives one a basis for making more reliable decisions.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is incredibly fun. If you have ever played Feeding Frenzy, you will enjoy this! This game is very hard to put down.
B00C7O8MJ8|3.0|I love soundtracks, but I know for a fact that Giacchino recorded well over 90 minutes of music. Yet, we only get around 45 minutes of music on this release. Worse, two major tracks are missing: the end titles and the terrific &#34;Ode to John Harrison&#34;, which he played on a radio show, but is missing here.<br /><br />I realize that Paramount wants to wring every penny out of us fans, and will probably release a super-hoopty mega-whomp Deluxe Set in the future (which will be sold out before it's sold), but darn it, give us the good stuff in the main release!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The ending left you hangng.  I'm not really sure if Jacob did it.  Was his mom involved? What happened to his father?
B002H09I0Y|5.0|Excellent movie.  Enjoyed the storyline.  Never knew what would happen next.  Michael Douglas was very good in this movie.  Highly recommended.
B00847KFDS|5.0|John Fogerty sounds better than ever.This style of music will never fade away.I grew up enjoying his music and hope he will keep on doing it.
0140449337|5.0|Meditations was written between 170-180 AD as Emperor Marcus Aurelius lead his troops in the areas currently known as Austria, Slovakia, and Hungary.  He and his troops were fighting in misty and swampy lowlands against Germanic tribes rebelling against Roman rule when the emperor died, likely of an infectious disease, ending his Meditations.  His musings are poignant, deeply insightful, and reveal the central tenets of Stoic thought in the form of daily meditations.  This is not a philosophically rigorous treatise but serves as a guide to daily life and is a deep well of psychological insight and moral guidance.<br /><br /> The Stoic philosophy guiding the thought of Marcus Aurelius is based on a strong belief in the nobility and importance, as a philosophic first principle, of Nature.  Stoics believed that Nature is governed by fundamental laws and is understandable through rational thought.  The method of logic could be used to pursue physics (the study of nature) and to guide humans (ethics).  Logic urged one to strive to be free from excessive emotion, to be guided by reason and justice, and to treat others with a sense of fairness.  Marcus Aurelius saw change as a force of fate and accepted the world he knew as the best of all possible worlds when viewed in the long range.  He would argue that the world is well beyond our ability to control and one should rationally accept what it offers up impassively, free from irrational, emotional judgements.<br /><br />  The actions of all men with whom he interacted on a daily basis would be included in this outer world in which he was immersed.  This would lead him to acceptance of their actions and thoughts as aspects of fate.  He might discuss the irrational action of a comrade, but this discussion would occur in a balanced, impartial manner, respectful of larger forces motivating the action.  He sought to rise above the turbulence and distortions inherent in emotional reactions, controlling his internal state and theouter reaction that would arises from it.<br /><br /> A counter argument to an extreme Stoic position is that disregarding emotions may deprive one of much of life's richness and pleasures.  Approaching music, art, literature, and love from a plateau devoid of emotion may be, in some measure, neither successful nor rewarding.  Additionally, the Stoic goal of abandoning an emotional response to the world, abandoning feeling, or at least relegating to unimportance the experience of pain and pleasure both, ignores the reality of the limitations of the human mind.  The experience of emotions have the potential to make a positive contribution to our lives.  A philosophic system which builds on Stoic control of emotions but recognizes the importance of these emotions and places them in an appropriate relation to logic might more accurately reflect the beauty and constraints of the human condition.<br /><br /> The above is a response to an extreme Stoic position.  Marcus Aurelius' Meditations elicits few such reactions in its balanced, calm, and wise aphorisms urging harmony with the people and world surrounding us.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not much more to say other than Downton keeps on delivering. Very emotional season. Lots of twists, turns, unexpected events, and tear-jerking moments, but also much joy. This season was the most Shakespearean. A tragedy at its finest.
B0024FA9IM|4.0|In trying to use CGI and update the timeline, the story got bogged down in technology and unrealistic situations, like going close to a sun. The movie did not seem like the series of adventures that would have made it fascinating but instead was a series of crisis and arguments among the humans. The TV series was campy but you enjoyed how problems were worked out. The chemistry between the actors in this movie was missing.
B000003S5G|5.0|This album is my favorite by Air.  I play it several times a week.  Even my Toddler gets excited when we drop in the CD and press Play.  If you don't own any Air albums, give this one a try.  If you're on the fence, grab a used copy for a fraction of the cost (just be prepared to wait for a few weeks like I did for parcel post delivery).
B008VJYWMY|5.0|Il Divo is the BEST group of its kind on the planet! The blend and quality of their voices is unequalled. The songs on this album comprise a wonderful listening experience. They do beautiful arrangements of some of my favorites. All I have to do is close my eyes and I'm transported to another place with these guys. Having seen them live in concert certainly enhances my listening experience.
B006HL9G10|5.0|I use it every day since purchasing it....you can set your choice of bells at intervals to refocus you in your meditation, to let you know when to begin and when to end.....also you can journal and connect with a community of meditators....pretty neat!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Should have checked better.  Without a 2 way camera I still don't know what use it is.  Would not buy again,
B00138CV5K|5.0|Would recommend that anyone who likes Ray buy this album.  His voice is one of the best around.  Waiting for his next album to come out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app me and my cousin love to play this app together it works area on our kindle fires
B007BZM30M|3.0|I tried this and it is okay, however, I don't think I would buy the album as I feel that most of the songs sound pretty much like this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play it all the time its the best game ever needs changes and bug fixes. But really great game.
B00138KKP8|5.0|Ray is another singer who can make any song his own.  I look for any songs that he covers.  As you can see, he is one of my favorites.
B00DI75SWM|4.0|U can add pics to your words! U can change the words! and u can change background colors patterns! It's so worth $0.99
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Absolutely love Gabriel Macht and have since I saw him in Because I Said So. He's sexy as all get out but more importantly, his character is flawed yet has a heart of gold. Love Suits and can't wait for Season 3!!!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this case! It protected my phone, I could still hear calls and my music crystal clear, the screen did not bubble or distort anything, and the dirt stayed out of my phone when I put it in my pocket at work. Unfortunately, 3 weeks after I got this case my phone died and I had to use my upgrade. Since Sprint discontinued the iPhone 4s 32gb, I moved up to the iPhone 5 and can no longer use this case.<br /><br />The case is lightweight, compact, and an excellent barrier to dirt, germs, and abuse to the phone. I was very happy with it and wish I still had my old phone so I could continue to use it again.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It wasn't as good as his other two books, in my opinion.  I don't have anything else to add to my comments.
B0044IABFS|5.0|I am a complete fan of Prison Break; every season!! The ending of this season was VERY sad. The brilliance of this show is undeniable. In my opinion, this era of shows are no longer around. Networks no longer take the time to build and develop shows anymore. They give it one season and in some cases, a few episodes and if they're not getting the response expected, they cancel immediately without allowing the development of the show or to get the word out to others that may be missing out. When Prison Break was on the air, I missed both Seasons 1 and Seasons 2.  A friend told me about it and I came on board in its 3rd Season. I LOVED IT!!!!! Thanks goodness for Amazon Prime. Prison Break is the very reason WHY I became a member. I had to see both seasons and so many other shows I may have missed the first or seconds seasons of. If you've never seen this show, GET IT!!!! You won't be disappointed!!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Very well written and hard to put down until you get to the end. And was it really the end?
B004SUWR2C|5.0|How can you go wrong with Uno?? Love this game! Always have! Love playing it on my Kindle! It's very realistic, like you're playing with your crew!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love it mainly because it is by angry birds people and it has green pigs bottle rocket airplane glider
B004GHNIRK|1.0|The great literary style of Victor Hugo in what is perhaps his most famous work is unfortunately lost in this free translation. Most sentences longer than a few words are difficult to understand and some are almost unreadable.<br /><br />I very much enjoy Victor Hugo's writing and the way he develops characters and explores themes - I love Les Miserables in particular. I was very disappointed when I started reading this free kindle version, however, as most all of what I love about Victor Hugo is difficult to enjoy here.
B008L1DNGI|2.0|its a little confusing to play and it is not even that awsomeley fun so I would never recommend this game
B001DRF84W|5.0|Good classs put to bluray with good sound and special effects. well worth the money if you are into the hulk series
B00B2V66VS|2.0|IT GLICHES ALOT!IT GLICHES ALOT! GLICHES ALOT! IT GLICHES ALOT! I ALMOST GOT TO MY NEW HIGHSCORE AND THEN IT EXITED ME OUT OF IT
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|The author gave me a shilling read as to what was and is going on in North Korea to its free people as well as those in these camps. I tried to imagine what it would be like to be so dominated by evil and it was a shocking and unfathomable experience. It was interesting to find out that the human spirit can not dulled by hatred. I am sure he has not fully recovered from his experience, but freedom will prevail and he will not loose his humanity.
B009IH0ICG|4.0|I ordered this because I wanted something a bit smaller than the standard. It works great with my small weber.
0811879542|5.0|My son read it at school and want it to have it, is so fun to read, we love it, recommended 100%
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Typical Tom Clancy. Story moves alone at a fast pace. Definitely worth the read. Look forward to the next one.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Having only seen part one (a million times!), I recently went on a Die Hard spree and watched them all in a row. For comparison purposes, I would rate Part 1 with 5 stars, Part 2 with 5 stars, Part 3 with 4 stars, and Part 4 with 5 stars (my favorite). Of course if you are a Die Hard Bruce Willis fan, then you have no choice, you must watch it.
1439130833|1.0|I had thought i was the actual book The Secret. Then I got this small thing where your suppose to rip out the pages.
B004FOA84A|3.0|It would be much better if there were clues included in the game.  Now you have to go on the website to find out how to move on and that kind of ruins the whole thing.
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|Maybe I am getting to old but I think they just slapped this movie together so they could make the Avengers. The first hour (pre-action) was great it was all down hill from there. I never thought I would knock a superhero for being unrealistic but here me out. In a world where all these event could take place, there are some SERIOUS inconsistencies here. I wont spoil the plot for you but it is not well thought out. The story line goes well until the bad fighting begins. The \\"bad guys\\" always do stupid thing and have horrible aim but these WW2 super soldiers with better technology than we have today are by far the most dysfunctional clowns ever. The good guys have interesting characters though. That is really all that this movie has. The action just made me say \\"uuuum what?\\".
B00957T6X6|5.0|Great story, keeps you on the edge of your seat. Character development is amazing. The intrigue and back stabbing never stops. Best non military read I have ever had. It is a wonder how Martin keeps all the stories in line for the overall novel
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My old cable broke and Amazon was kind enough to send me a new one, free of charge.  The new one works fine and is doing its job!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|hve again seen 1 of 3 films already and have enjoyed them it and want to watch all 3 of them in a couple of days days
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Hours of fun brings me back to the movie I loved so much as a young man. I recommend this to any dino or movie buff
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I personally think of this film very funny and am going to get it Blu Ray soon but I got for my friend and she enjoys it a lot very funny!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Although there are limited instructions overall this game is good. Things move rather slow for this reason. If you just check in a few times a day it is possible to build a larger city.
B00D8WMASM|3.0|Cole has a lot on his mind, and is never afraid to discuss it, with names included. A solid effort, but there is not a single &#34;I have to have that on repeat&#34; track on this album. Some growth here, I'll tune in for next album.
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|So far so good. I find the controls a bit sensitive but it takes some getting used to. This is not a yank and bank kind of game. Would like the ability to change views but this game is a ton of fun. I like the approach indicator voice.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game, fun and entertaining. Some levels are harder than others but none so difficult that you can't solve them. Do sometimes wish they had hints.
B008Q0AJA2|5.0|I have seen this movie a few times and watched it again recently because the kids haven't seen it. My 16, 13, and 11 year olds all enjoyed the show and I enjoyed watching it again. Picture quality was excellent.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I have been told all my tests for celiac are negative; however, I have an auto immune disease.  This all makes sense to me now.  While it will be hard at first to give up the wheat, I know my health won't get better until I do.  Finally I see a light at the end of the tunnel.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|when keeping up with my local weather any time of day this is most helpful I totally recommend to anyone
B005LAIHZY|5.0|We bought this set in order to learn more about our granddaughter's favorite movie.  We find it to be a wonderful way to spend quality time with her and to be able to share in her joy over the movie.  We're very pleased with this purchase, along with some of the costume pieces we gave her for her birthday.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This book is fun to read!<br />This is a good book for kids.<br />I love this book so much.<br />Good book!<br />I'm just 9<br />A am awesome just like the book
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Every page is rich in language and story. The history of place and people captured my attention from beginning to end. I care deeply for these characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun to play. I only wish you could earn coins better. That is my only complaint for this game. Had really horse stimulation which i like in a game like this one.
0061478784|5.0|My friend told me that I should read this book (I've yet to watch the film) and I'm glad I did! It's a very nice, quick-paced fantasy but not the typical one I've learned to expect. This is very original in its plot and characters. A must read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this minion run game is really fun and it is addictive to play with it is just like subway surfers and I recommend this game for kids this game is fun and will not do Any harm to your device
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Not as good as I thought it would be. Some really funny parts but kind of a disappointment for me.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Thus is an awesome fan  I like this a lot. It helps me became a better cosmetics person I just love this game (:
B001ER4CNY|5.0|Packaging was in perfect condition and its as I wanted it.  I grew up watching this show and I love the laughs
0143106333|2.0|Lately I've been reading Dahl's books - \\"Witches\\" (which I adored), \\"Matilda\\" (which I adored) and \\"Chocolate Factory.\\"<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the first part of \\"Chocolate Factory,\\" building up to the heart of the book, Charlie's journey  through the chocolate factory.  The journey itself, though, is simultaneously tedious and a bit appalling.<br /><br />Why is it tedious? - this is probably a matter of individual taste.  Basted on the other Dahl books I just rad, I expected it to be subtle and humorous. It wasn't.<br /><br />Why appalling?  The book is unapologetically didactic, modeled loosely on Dante's Inferno.  But a lot of the values it is based on seem arbitrary, Dahl's  personal whims that I simply don't relate to.  For example, Dahl goes to great lengths to lampoon and punish gum-chewing and television -watching, but much of the book is devoted to a celebration of cacao addiciton and sugar addiction.  Why?<br /><br />One of the five children on the tour, Mike Teavee, repeatedly asks spot-on questions that Willy Wonka doesn't want to answer.  In other Dahl novels, children who ask impertinent questions tend to emerge as heroes.  In \\"Chocolate Factory,\\"  Wonka simply pretends that Mike is mumbling.  Eventually, Mike, like the other children who are not in Dahl's favor) is punished and gotten rid of.  Why?<br /><br />Willy Wonka's factory is located in a town where the factories are being shut down and the local population is out of work and (in the case of Charlie's family) slowly starving.  The chocolate factory, we discover,  is a vast subterranean plantation where Wonka has solved his labor problem by relying on a work force that he smuggled in from Africa in shipping crates.  The work force is heavily addicted to cacao and Wonka keeps them happy by paying them in cacao beans. At the end of the book, Willy Wonka is going to pass this happy plantation along to Charlie.  Dahl assures us that they will all live happily ever after.  Why?<br /><br />Sorry, but this book just doesn't do it for me.
B00AKYRCNY|4.0|He loves the sounds the vehicles make and he is so pleased when he puts everything in the correct spot.  Great for long trips in the car....keeps him busy and happy!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Imaginative story, full of action, fun to tie in real places on the map with a fictional world of spirits. Never get tired of Riordan's humorous and relaxed style.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This was a very good movie. If I have to be honest the first 20 minutes had me nodding but the rest of the movie made up for it.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|my grandkid love this movie they watch it so much i might have to buy another one  but for the money you cant beat it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book because of all the excitement and drama that it had. I would recommend to anyone who loves adventure and a good story. I rated this book five stars because it is one of the greatest books that I've ever read.
B00030DEQE|5.0|great product worked as soon as i got it in no problems at all would recomened to anyone order yours today
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|My only complaint is that it makes you spend your peanuts in the tutorial and they you have to buy more with real money to have enough to really make the game fun and have more than one nursery going at a time.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis was fantastic as was rest of the cast it was a great opportunity to see how the process of a law was handled in 1865 Tommy Lee Jones should have won supporting actor award
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I bought this app so when my kids are in free mode they can use it to see how much battery is left. Its so simple my 5 year old was able to use it with no problem and it was free so I cant complain at all.
B0017SWSCW|4.0|Excellent book, lots of twists and turns. Would recommend it to anyone. Every in the book club enjoyed it too
B005AVIW54|3.0|I don't think much of what he writes about is true. But the book is entertaining.<br /><br />Wall Street occupies a small portion of this book. The story should be labelled Jordan  &#34;Raging drug addict&#34; Belfort
B005DJREGQ|5.0|This show is so addictive and I pretty much watched the first season in 2 days :)  Hope there are more than 2 seasons!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I adore watching this series!! The story line is fascinating and well researched. I feel like I am watching through a window into a life passed long ago never to return. It is suitable for family viewing which is very scarce these days! My 92 year old mother in law  watches with me and is always talking about the fashions and saying &#34; I remember hearing about that when I was a little girl&#34;. Wonderful job!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I just started playing Mahjong (Kendle Tablet edition) and I enjoyed it very much. It is very easy to play and navigate. I would buy it again.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This item was a gift to my eife. It was in great condition, and was a great price. My wife was very pleased with this gift. :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really makes you think. Every level is different. Have to use your analytical skills to work this one. Good brain exercise.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and after my copy disappeared, my dvd collection seemed incomplete, so I had to order it again on amazon. Not only was it cheap, but Amazon also provided me with a digital copy to watch until my copy arrived.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|There is a bug that when you reach 10000 meters the game shuts down. I can't wait for the update to fix it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This has a lot of good different games and I like these games.  I really enjoy this games. Some of the games are challenging.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I'm an adult and not a fan of the teen vampire novels out there but this was fun and sweet and I always found myself rooting for this diverse group of kids. I'd put it on the same shelf as my Harry Potter collection.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I am interested in watching more of this show. Streaming had contrast problems, watched on Xbox 360 and husband said it was much darker than when he watched it on HD TV.
B004G600A4|5.0|One of my granddaughter's watches this nearly every night.  It is so nice to be able to have movies that don't need censoring.
B004KKX814|5.0|This thing beats all the other Beys in battle.  Super durable!  We own LDrago and Pegassis and this one wins hands down!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really wish there were more levels to try was really getting into this game lol<br />It is just enough challenge without being to hard can't wait to see if there are more levels
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The book discussion group I belong to selected the Kitchen House. It evoked almost a full hour of discussion among 12 women. When a book garners that much interest, it merits this rating.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I have never watched a period piece before and I am 100% addicted to this show!  It's not only insightful to that Era but so carefully crafted as to how times changed.  Very well written!  I love the matriarch more than any character in history:&#62;)  She has a look where she doesn't say a word but know exactly what she is thinking.  The only thing I can say negative is that they aren't releasing Season 4 soon enough!  I can't wait!  This is a much watch series for sure!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I recommend all of the older kids out there to read this for fun and you will be attached to reading this over and over again and again!!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|If you're stuck trying to find something to watch, it's good enough.  I love Soderbergh's films generally, and maybe my expectations were too high, but this movie just didn't really stick with me.  No real complaints though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is awesome! Being boxed in is a disappointment, but it does provide Minecraft, nonetheless. Better graphics and no excuses for the lagless Terrain. I'm looking forward to the next future updates for the pocket edition!
1400069289|5.0|Got this at my library first and loved it so much purchased it to reread, highlight parts and make part of my everyday lifestyle.  Really made an impact in my life!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The  game is just cool and think<br />Skylanders game all the time of America in a few days ago found that the complete with a new study by a new study suggests
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Puzzles are unique &amp; challenging. Hidden object games abound. Lots of hints. Great extras!! Graphics are also available very well done .
0060730552|4.0|Interesting,story of two men, but very slow in spots.  Many terms related to mountain climbing I had never heard before and didn't know the full meaning in their situation..  ..
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love the game....I like how the levels increased in difficulty as you progress in the game...wish there were more games like it
B0050DIWFC|1.0|This book was crap. The main characters were underdeveloped and the writer gave us an inaccurate picture of the reality of their personalities. The last few chapters seemed to be about people from another story. I wish I had not wasted my time on this book. How did it make the list for \\"book of the year\\"?
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Page turner - looking forward to the next one - constant threats and the unexpected Highly recommended for those who like thrillers
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|We saw the movie in theaters and we really liked it! Glad to pick it up on Blu-Ray at a great price!
0062280228|5.0|How did we end up here?<br /><br />The William Morrow publicists sent me an email, like they normally do, and I saw this title was on that list.  I immediately put my name in for it.  Took a few months to receive it because they ran out of copies but I eventually got it and devoured it in nearly one sitting.  Imagine my surprise when I found out Phoenix was a stop in Neil's last book signing tour.  Snagged that up as well.  I'm on top of this.<br /><br />Okay, book.  You've got 50 pages.  Go!<br /><br />Like my favorite cheese THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE is a short book, less than 200 pages, so stopping after 50 seems like a bit of a crime.  Not to mention it's a Gaiman book so if you do end up stopping I'm just going to hazard a guess that you've suffered a massive heart attack or stroke and have had the unlucky chance of never being able to finish the book.  Hopefully when you get reincarnated you come upon Neil Gaiman knowledge quickly and re-find his titles without much effort.<br /><br />With the fairy tale-esque writing style, the subtle wit, a moldering corpse, a glimpse at the ocean in the Hempstock's backyard, the Hempstocks themselves and a boy's crusade to find his comic book there's too much going on here to want to put it down.  Will he or won't he eat the burnt toast?  Is the comic salvageable?  Will the bacteria ever listen?  HOW CAN YOU NOT GO ON AND LEAVE QUESTIONS LIKE THIS UNANSWERED?<br /><br />What worked . . .<br /><br />The Hempstocks.  Good lord, do books need more Hempstocks in them.  The casual nonchalance with which they deal with the troubles around them is enough for a standing ovation.  And even in the face of abject disparity there's still a resounding calm to their will and their actions.  There is nary a problem that can't be fixed, whether in this life or the next, or maybe a few more down the road.<br /><br />Ursula Monkton was a character in her own right, despite her ability to make things run amok.  She did so in such an underhanded, evil and sneaky way that one could really pat her on the back a little bit.  She knew how to get things done.  However, in the face of her own undoing she showed fear.  She didn't so much as put on a brave face as she did let fear leak through her eyes.  It made you feel a little sorry for her because, at the end of the day, she's just doing what her kind do to survive.  It just happens to be something that's detrimental to the rest of the world.  That's all.<br /><br />The setting of the book, the dark and the light, and how when things were really bad the setting reflected that overall plot mood.  And when they were good things were springy and vibrant and nothing could go wrong.  I guess that comes with telling the tale through the eyes of a seven-year-old.  Worlds are generally black and white to them and I think that was reflected in this recounting of this man's memory.  The voice of the story, even though it was looking back, maintained the air of innocence that only a child could have and which Gaiman captured so meticulously that if a kid had the vocabular capacity to actually speak their head movie thoughts like this and articulate themselves in such a manner they actually would.  He presented a grander, complex story through the eyes of a child without pomposity or grandiose speaking.  He KISS'd (kept it simple, stupid) and in that simplicity he utterly nailed it.<br /><br />What didn't work . . .<br /><br />Um . . . the length of the book?  Even then I can't really complain but it was so utterly finished by the end it would have been a travesty to keep writing.<br /><br />One part that didn't work for me was with the worm and how the boy compared it to spaghetti.  As it turned out, at that very moment, I was actually eating spaghetti and I read that scene and it completely killed my appetite.  I didn't appreciate that very much.<br /><br />And in the end . . .<br /><br />I'm convinced I need to go and re-read STARDUST because I would have a grander appreciation for it now than when I first read it years ago.  The glory and the WORDS within this book are nearly unparalleled and it's no wonder Gaiman has the following he does.  What raw, incredible talent and to be able to give such a complete, ocean-depth story in such a few pages.  Other authors should be jealous of this talent.  Truly.  This is, like, the nirvana of writing and it's rather a bitch because how can I go back to reading other books after this?  That bar is going to have to come down a bit for them, isn't it?
B00C9U9YLA|5.0|First, the music. This may go down as my favorite Queens of the Stone Age album of all time. Coming off of Josh Homme's near-death experience, I expected it to be dark. Dark themes didn't serve QOTSA very well on Lullabies to Paralyze, so I wasn't expecting it love ...Like Clockwork as much as I do. But, as soon as I saw the promotional videos by Boneface, I was blown away by the concept and immediately pre-ordered the Limited Deluxe Edition vinyl. There is nothing like the feeling of a 180 gram slab of wax in your hands, and this package has 2 of them mastered at 45 RPM for improved sound quality. Although the booklet containing Boneface artwork, song lyrics, and credits is non-removable, the construction of the packaging does not feel cheap. It includes a download card for a digital copy of the album on MP3 and FLAC (3 downloads per code). Again, the music. It's a great record. It's not ALL dark - Smooth Sailing and Fairweather Friends in particular provide some levity. Dave Grohl and Joey Castillo share drumming duties. Trent Reznor makes a notable vocal appearance. Mark Lanegan, Nick Oliveri, Elton John, and Brody Dalle Homme make less impressionable contributions.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I LIKED having my multiple location info on one page for instant comparison.<br /><br />I LIKED my pollen/allergy information.<br /><br />I DON'T like that the app is now running down my battery faster.<br /><br />I JUST DON'T LIKE this app anymore.<br /><br />Regardless of what you claim above in the \\"What's New\\" section...NO, Weather Channel, you are NOT listening.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun when you're bored and love horses as much as I do. the app keeps you busy and fills time beautifully
B00AB7IA1S|5.0|I did not find this game to be PARTICULARLY, difficult, as others have said. In fact, I found it to be quite a bit challenging.<br /><br />Was it so challenging that I wrung my brain into little pieces trying to figure it out only to uninstall it out of FRUSTRATION?...No (you know how some of those games are). However, I did find it challenging enough that I had to apply some critical thinking skills before solving the puzzle.<br /><br />It is the perfect speed for me - but then again, I'm not a puzzle aficionado as some of the other reviewers probably are.<br /><br />I think that this puzzle is for the \\"rest of us\\". :-)
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This collection is just beautiful. If you like old fashion way of collecting dvd series, this is a truly nice one. Pretty pictures inside, very girly. Very good option to make a present to somebody who loves Sex & the city.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|it works on my kindle fire but it DOES NOT FREAKING TALK TO ME!<br />talking ginger is better. U HAVE TO BUY STUFF TO HAVE MORE FUN<br />this app sucks so much!!!!!!!!!!do not download!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I rated the entire series 5 stars although Season 3 was a bit more of a soap opera than I would have liked. Yet Maggie Smith shines so it is so worth viewing.<br />The post-war generational \\"clash\\" of world views was compelling and the Irish issue added political flavoring.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|I LOVED it for a minute. now that s***ty game is a really really a piece of junk u have limited amount of bottles this is a piece of junk!!!!
1451629192|4.0|I was interested in known more about Jaycee's struggles and this book provided it.  People have to hope she has a wonderful life now.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Quick, engrossing, and interesting read.  I found myself concerned for main character and wanting to know more about her.  I quickly read the author's two other novels.  Equally as good.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|So different that the movie that just cam out, but different is good! Its a great read. Try it, you'll like it.
B00CDWZOU4|3.0|I thought it would be a steelbox. Just special plastic package. The package seems a bit cheap. There are some special features but I think they are the same as in the normal blu ray edition.
B002TO1Z8Q|3.0|Good for when I want to feel retro, but still pick my way through to find what I want to hear
B00AE5R2NO|4.0|It is cool how there is a net that is hidden in the middle of the gup E. My son loves the toy.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|We got to learn more about his personal life instead of his movies. Which we found a lot more interesting.
B004JVXTL8|4.0|I thought it was a good continuation of the origianal &#34;Paranormal Activity.&#34; Also the 3rd an th was good. I am looking forward to &#34;Paranormal Activity 5&#34; this fall 2013 when it is comes out and is available to purchase.. Barbie
B007N8RULO|4.0|Easy to play, hard to master.  A fun variation on the game of solitare.  Try it & see if this is for you.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Since I remember the event well, it was interesting and intriguing to discover the story behind the scenes. It is a sad state that American poliiticians are afraid of an standing up for our own. Thank goodness we had our Canadian allies to help a strong American agent and operative, move forward to do the right thing. Both my husband and I enjoyed the move, DVD, and sharing it with others. The writers, directors, and producers did an excellent job with details that needed to be shared.
B00AEFYK5M|5.0|I have always loved this movie, and I wanted my granddaughters to see it so we are all going to have a movie night. I haven't received it yet either
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|My husband andI watched it together and it is rare that we both enjoy the same movie. We both loved Quartet...my husband laughed most of the way through it. First rate actors, even if the story line was predictable.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I don't thin I finished that one, it was different from other books that I usually read.  I have several friends that have read all of them and love them
B009P5K4HK|5.0|All Amy Winehouse fans should buy this album for their collections, this CD comes with a DVD of the concert Amy Winehouse gave in Ireland before her tragic death.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I did enjoy the movie and had seen it years ago and wanted to compare it to the new one and I still think maybe the original might be the best
B0096PAA6E|5.0|This album has proven that Gary Clark Jr's Blak and Blu is one of the best albums of the year. Gary Clark Jr is one of the best guitar players on the Planet. Eric Clapton better watch out because Gary Clark Jr will raise the bar when it comes to playing guitar..
B00C16NWUG|1.0|Dear Friend:  That is nothing wrong with the movie itself, however; the disc is a piece of trash, I only played it once and second<br />  time, that was something wrong at the end, could not play the last two songs, so called the special collector edition?<br />  Great film, Great music, but trash products. I take the lost.
B00000JTB2|5.0|In Session is one of the best blues CD's on the market, featuring Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert King, this album is a must have for any collectors of Blues music..
B004PZ4HC8|5.0|The book is always better than the movie and this one is a shining star, hard to put it down once you begin.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Jamie Foxx has done another wonderful job in acting for this one. It's just some very special about movies on the topic of slavery. I've seen this movie 3 times when it was playing in theatres.
B00992CF6W|5.0|so cool y'all need to make it with texture packs and mode plz. I hope you can<br /> also have skins.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|If you like movies about cage fighting, you will enjoy The Warrior. It's the absolute very best mixed martial arts movie that I've seen in years.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I've watched all 3 seasons of Downton Abbey in about 2 weeks.  Now that I'm all caught up, I actually catch myself missing the characters.  I would recommend to everyone!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I think it earned five stars because it felt like you were in the book. I recommend this book to all ages.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Really good release for Tom Keifer after he had throat surgery an battled some inner demons.  Cinderella has always been one of the best 80's Hair Metal bands. Keifer is a great song writer an well his voice doesn't go as high anymore the album still stands on it's own as a great comeback release.  Keifer has a-little bit of everything on this album; this may not be a Cinderella release (nobody knows if we will ever see another on of those ever again) but it is a good rock album.  Good riffs, good ballads, everything you could want a price under $9.00 ?? Pick your copy of the independent release and supper Tom & Cinderella hopefully one day moving forward.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Compared to her other crossfire novels I believe this lacked suspense.  The book really didn't get good until I was 70% into it.. She focused on a lot of irrelevant characters. And really another book... I  thought it was supposed to be a trilogy. guess She's waiting for her movie deal .
044022425X|5.0|We live about 45 miles from good shopping. I bought Drums of Autumn for my husband on Amazon.com as he is a big Diana Gabaldon fan. Then we went to Scotland with friends and he loved to see so many of the places he had read about in her books and regale us with historical tidbits he had learned from her stories.
B0064MPXFA|3.0|Have enjoyed the series -- interesting episodes.  Not crazy about the looks of the leading lady -- but her acting is good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This doesn't disappoint.  Great acting, great drama - loved everything about it.  The cliff hanger was just that - I can't wait for Season 4!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game makes you think. Kept me interested on each floor. Would be great game for kids between the ages of eight and twelve.
B004W1GCNC|2.0|Some great acting, but it seemed like a cheap immitation of Downton Abbey. I turned it off before the end of episode 2 - nothing grabbed me.
0470913029|5.0|Fantastic recipes and menus at the back of the book, and if followed, I believe this is a healthy way to eat.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This novel is amazing - totally worth the read.  The narrator's voice is unique, the plot is moving, the characters are full.  Totally recommend this read.
B00821OX98|4.0|Why does the acting seem forced at times ... Overall I love it because aliens taking over the earth what's not to like ...
B000026E4I|5.0|The last great CD Guns and Roses put out, a must have to complete your collection of Guns and Roses.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|great book once I started reading it I couldn't put it down at first I didn't think this book was for me
B008Y73940|4.0|It was entertaining and had a nice twist at the end, I would recommend this movie for a nice light evening.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This is a great kids game for visual, matching and aim to get their brain in gear and eye and hand coordination.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I love playing jetpack joyride, I even got it on my laptop and play it frequently on both my kindle and laptop.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|It's an amazing show, the video was great quality. There were just a few pauses during the breaks but wonderful nonetheless.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The back feels like it's made out of high quality materials. Also, I was delighted to see a front pocket for storing papers or something slim. Inside the backpack are a bunch of customizable dividers, so you can organize it to fit your equipment. I was able to get my T3i, 18-55mm kit lens, 50mm f1.8, filters, Rhode mic, and other odds and ends to fit comfortably inside the bag. There's plenty of little pockets for storing SD cards and other things. This bag is perfect, pretty much. I tried out the AmazonBasics sling backpack for a bit and it just wasn't cutting it. This bag was a much better investment and is well worth a purchase from you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging. Had to use my thinking skills to figure out what needed to be done. I love this app
1781162646|5.0|this is a good read, short but powerful.  i read it in one night, put my light off at 6:00 am.  Good thing for Friday nights.  Buy or borrow this book!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|Awesome book I loved it..it's a dynamic way of life after death showing this little girl family go through this tragedy
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Riveting, full of suspense.. well written.  Yet sad. It tears at your heartstrings!  A great \\"real life\\" read.  Hard to put down ...
098357670X|5.0|This are the best book from how to drawing caricatures in mi unboxing im very happy o yenes baba o yes
B004DSD6T2|5.0|Sean Astin portrays Rudy with such determination.. I love the family scenes, snow, old home, old town. When I saw the story of his life I loved it even more
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The movies were in excellent condition. Very pleased with this purchase. Plus, I mean it's Harry freaking Potter. Come on.
B004YCKJSS|5.0|This movie reminds me of times growing up in Long Island, and also, PA.  Good American ways that seem gone. The acting is great on all parts.  Perfect cast .  If you like snow watch this movie.
1781162646|5.0|After Under The Dome, I thought he was done, but this book, although way short for him and my liking, gave me hope again. I loved it!
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Great movie! It is really more of a love story but full of action. There are some sad parts too. The best thing about the movie is the soundtrack though.
1439190275|2.0|Lawyers know that you can put an expert witness on the stand and she'll explain why the science supports a certain side and eviscerates the other, she'll likely have good credentials, etc. And she'll be answered by the other side's expert, who'll have good credentials and preach the opposite conclusion. Thus it goes with the low carb/high protein/high fat Atkins group vs the high carb/low fat/moderate protein China Study groups including Ornish, McDougall, etc.<br /><br />Having tried Atkins, and really having adhered to it to the point I was checking my urine with strips to ensure I was in ketosis I can tell you--anecdotally--I lost very little weight. My cholesterol shot up. Triglycerides were high. And I was cranky too. But that was MY experience, and I quit the diet because I just got grossed out with the menu. This book is an update of the standard Atkins regimen. It allows a few more carbs but it's still the high protein high fat diet Atkins recommended. Now, keep in mind that Atkins himself had significant heart disease when he died, and he weighed 258 pounds! See [...] (last visited 9 July 2013).<br /><br />If you want to try this approach New Atkins is a good presentation of it. But do yourself a favor: get your blood drawn before you start. Get it drawn again six weeks later. Then six weeks after that. If you lose weight and your cholesterol, tryglycerides, etc. are improving, you know this is probably safe and healthy for you. If not, get off of it. It's too dangerous to undertake ANY radical dietary regimen without checking your blood, particularly one where you chiefly subsist on protein and fat.<br /><br />And remember--despite all the scientific-sounding hocus pocus about insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome and the overworked pancreas--losing weight remains simple math. Ingesting more calories than you burn = weight gain and vice-versa. It doesn't matter whether the calories are from butter or brown rice. There ain't no way around this.<br /><br/>Finally, also look into the Krebs cycle which, put very simply, means that the body burns fat for fuel efficiently only when there is adequate carbohydrate in the system. In practical terms, this means that the quickest way to burn fat while exercising is to keep the dietary fats low, the complex carbs fairly high.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|It's way too much... This classic will make you think about all the things we don't know we don't know...
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Wonderful jobs by Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert DiNero, Jacki Weaver, and Chris Tucker. Very deserving of the nominations made and awards that were won.
B002NN5F7A|4.0|Never saw it before.  Great actors; interesting story line done in an interesting way.  Made me glad I didn't have a job selling real estate in that manner!!!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I've enjoyed reading this book as much as the first 2 in the series.  with the way this book is dealing with the main characters, it's guaranteed that the next 2 books will very interesting.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|Deep Purple has always had orchestration that keeps sending you higher. Through the years each album shines with progressive passages that are simply beautiful.<br />Excellent music.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|I love Maggie Smith in anything.  Also loved the music.  Story was marginal.  I wanted the quartet to sing in the finale, even if it was dubbed.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining series on tv. I would highly recommend to take the time to watch. Very good show.
144937980X|5.0|Written by Processing authors, it is excelent, helpful, well organized and very worthwhile. An excellent companion to the Schiffman book. I recommend both to new programmers like me.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This may be considered a young adult novel, but no matter what your age is, it will touch you.  This book finds a way in a very short time, to grasp your attention and grip at your emotions.  Absolutely worth the purchase. Do not hesitate to buy this.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Why do we Americans love British period pieces so much? Maybe because they transport us to a world we know very little about, a world that appears to have order and decorum -- at least on the surface. But beneath the surface -- downstairs, if you will -- there's conflict and pain and confusion and drama due primarily to the changing times. I think the latest version of U.D. does a great job of bringing the original up to date, to the mid to late 30s. The characters are fascinating and well defined, the story lines are relevant to the time. Thouroughly enjoyable.
B005DJREJS|4.0|Nothing like my high school experience of being actually awkward but well written show and great jokes. The characters have charisma while also being a little whiny sometimes but it's a nice thing to put on and hang out and watch mindlessly.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|We just loved it.  Andrea's language range along with that beautiful voice is nothing short of God given and we could listen to him all day and night.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I absolute LOVE this Jeff Lynne CD.  His selection of music is great.  It is one of my favorite CD's.  I would definitely recommend LONG WAVE.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game. its a lot of fun. very addicting too! can never stop playing when I start! ahahaha
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I can not get enough of this series. It made me want to read more on the Tudors. Great series!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It really is a great app I like it but it's really just not the type of game I'd play but it's great for toddlers and other little kids it's very challenging too so don't expect it to be easy but it's good I recommend this app for people who aren't obsessed with drawing chatting or fashion like me but it's good
B005CWRB44|4.0|Excellent light output, slightly poor design.  To turn the light off you need to twist to the point that the light is barely held in one piece, exposing the inner part of the light...weakening the waterproof ability.  Still a big fan of Fenix, just going to opt out of the twist on/off models.<br /><br />UPDATE: I love this little puppy, plan on getting 3 more!
0763631205|5.0|Beautifully illustrated.  I bought it for myself to display with my Dickens Byers Carolers dolls at Christmas, but this would make a lovely book to give as a gift.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It took me a long time to get around to taking a look at Downton Abbey, even though many friends kept encouraging me.  Season 1 definitely got me hooked!  Each season, as the characters develop and the story line expands, it is an increasing pleasure to watch &#34;good&#34; TV. It's so refreshing to watch quality on television. The scripts, the drama, the costumes, the historical glimpses, the interaction between nobility and their staff..... all is so well done. With today's deluge of &#34;reality TV&#34; and &#34;canned laughter&#34; comedies, it's a jewel to find real acting with real plots!  Season 3 is especially intriguing with so much turmoil and grief. By now the characters are so well developed that you can really relate to all of their trials and tribulations. All of the actors are excellent. Maggie Smith actually makes me laugh aloud with her snarky quips!
1401322786|1.0|I bought this because my book club wanted to read it.  I did not like it at all and I am a prolific reader.  I felt like the writer was preaching to me to make me feel guilty about having an ordered day and I was unconvinced.  Went right into the give-away box.
B002M87V0A|5.0|They just don't make this kind anymore. Real talent in the cast. Real genius in the music. Oldies are Goodies.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Julian Fellowes sure knows how to create a cliffhanger! Only two episodes out of the first three seasons failed to make me jump to the next episode. Can't wait for season four!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is very user friendly and has a great look!  I love having pinterest anywhere I go! I also like how they are constantly improving it for the better.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|easy to use and no problems. it's been my primary alarm for over a year. I like the way it starts out quiet then gets louder if you. ignore it.
B004GJYRA0|5.0|Great movie that will be shown,played, for many years to come, Except for a couple of words, this is  great family entertainment.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|30STM is my favorite band!  This album is totally different than the others.  It's a mix of so many genres of music.  It's a story, it's a new beginning!  They have done something amazing!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a very fun game. Since I love horses but I don't have the money to own horses. I love horses
B00785P2QC|4.0|Took out a star cause there are too many factories and the goals are starting to close in on me! Other than that it's a great game!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these types of games. I look for these types of games all the time. Thank you for your games.
B008KP6ENE|1.0|This kind of game is not my thing.  I downloaded because it was free.  Uninstalled it. Four more words required
B000EQ47GS|5.0|What more can be said?  This is one of the best selling albums in the modern era.<br />Brad Delp's vocal strength combined with Tom Scholz's pioneering production genius created the Midas touch for these guys.<br />There isn't a bad track on this album.  It'd be nice if the CD release kept the same order of tracks as the original vinyl release.
0345350499|4.0|I found myself reading this book often time when I had others things to do which is to say by personal observation that it was riveting. The characters were believable and human. I found myself in agreement with everything the Taleisin Merlin said. This was a different and interpretation of the Arthur myths than mine and yet I found them entirely credible.<br /><br />It was not a flawless work however the flaws were small. There are brief allusions to this though the females tended to be fifteen, Arthur's Gwen being an exception who was nineteen because she was held in a convent until a husband was found for her which was also done from time to time by royalty. Most women in that time were married by fourteen, most men fought their first battle at fifteen. Also they are referred to as 'children' which would not have been the case unless of course the people addressing them were old and as often as not, it was stated by people in their early twenties. Lastly there would be less of a distinction made between plants an individual would eat and those used for in spiritual practices. The word 'drug' would not be the best word choice for, although in the Dutch it means 'plant' and has no special application--which would include potatoes and strawberries, grass and even trees--it tends to have an umbrella application in the 20th and 21st century vernacular that includes substances that are either not natural or are extracted from plants and refined and are more often not the plants themselves such as pharmaseuticals, the root word which is 'pharmakia' which means 'poisoner' or 'to poison' depending on the context.<br /><br />Otherwise an excellent novel and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys good fiction.
B000ICXQXS|5.0|I don't understand how Paul Newman wasn't even nominated for an Oscar.  I think he just made playing the part look so easy, no one felt he even worked at it.  A number of great character actors playing all kinds of roles.  The beautiful adaptation of the Scott Joplin rags by Marvin Hamlisch.  Awesome costumes by Edith Head.  Just great stuff all around.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee is a great writer.  Story flew past.  Now reading a third book of his.  You can't put them down.
B00005YW4H|2.0|A little disappointed.  Only a couple of songs I really love.  But sometimes the other songs will grown on you in time.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Love this movie.  Very funny.  My 10 year old and 7 year old loved it.  The end was super sweet.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What can I say, it's Adele.  Not one bad song on the disc.  Seven more words are required, but I think I've said it all.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|Whats not to love about this movie!  This is my all time favorite movie and its on Blue ray!  This makes me very happy!!!
B00CWVFZ8W|5.0|I loved the movie and I thought the actors were great.  Also a great love story wrapped up into a little horror, drama, and suspense. I recommend this movie to anyone.  Not for kids under 14,  Just a parents point of view.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this TV series.  I would go as far as saying it is my second favorite of all time.
B001NB5BA4|5.0|There's just something about U2.  From the close harmony to the plaintive guitar, this collection of music is the ultimate U2 sound.  Rock, a little folky, a great original sound.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I don't understand this zombie craze anyway.  It was a movie long ago and should have been bashed in the head.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Sure, it doesn't have the great 21st century special effects that we're all used to these days but it was actually ahead of its time in that regard back when it was made.  Add to that a really interesting story with some top-rate actors and you have one of the really classic and most important sci-fi, outer space movies of all time.  Great to see it on Blu-ray.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This historical fiction puts you at WWII in England during the worst bombing. All the facts learned in history class lend credence to the story. I found the twists in the story were supported by the facts as told in the story. I guessed some of them but was surprised by others so I was kept engaged all through the book. Very enjoyable.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|While I am not familiar with the Super Heroes, I enjoyed this movie.  It should have been 30 minutes shorter.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Matilda is a wonderful tale of a little girl who is special. The story gives children from homes that are and are not so perfect, a chance to believe that all things are possible if only you put your mind to it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book is much so rich in character and story development.  I'm pleasantly surprised that the HBO episodes, for the most part, follow the overall story.  After reading the book, the characters in the HBO show are fitting.  What a great read!  I finished it in a week and moved on to the second book.  I'm looking forward to finishing the series.
B001ED7C58|5.0|looked awesome and worked just fine and price was great, quality was great too, would purchase from again in future
B0093QE37S|5.0|One of the all time greats that is still laugh out loud funny.  This is a can't miss if you are into classic movies.
3836503050|5.0|looked awesome and worked just fine and price was great, quality was great too, would purchase from again in future
B00A77II0U|4.0|I loved it but maybe just a little many hidden object scenes.  The puzzles were clever without too much difficulty.
B00004RFCM|5.0|looked awesome and worked just fine and price was great, quality was great too, would purchase from again in future
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book did a good job of keeping me guessing. The twists and turns the book took we're very enjoyable and I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written and very descriptive.  Would recommend it to just about anyone.  The first-hand account was really quite riveting.  Makes one appreciate our soldiers even more.
044024630X|4.0|This Jack Reacher book explained how he was &#34;retired&#34; from active duty as a Major in the army.  The story itself was interesting in the fact that it held your interest throughout the entire book and the ending was quite different from what one would might expect.<br />A good read.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Fabulous, like all oh the episodes of this series. I was grateful that I was able to see this through Amazon since this episode was not aired.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a cute movie. Our 3 year old loves it! It's not annoying like some other kids movies. There's been days of playing this movie over and over again, I don't mind cause it's pretty funny!
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This CD is a great follow up for AiC! Still not the same without Layne but badass nonetheless. Definitely a must have!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I used to really like this app. But they changed it. Very dissappointed. It was much better the other way. I hope they change it back.
B000QGEB12|5.0|this movie has the action and the comedy that i love some much it is a beautiful movie and i love it so much
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I loved this book,  I thought the characters were well developed and it had many surprises.  Kept me reading for two straight days.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not a big zombie fan and this show is so great we watched it all weekend..highly recommended...way to go AMC
B005DD7H50|5.0|This is such a great story, the performances are decent and the characters are well defined.  You will have a good time with this one!
B007DIQC90|5.0|Love every song on this CD...a really great band with a fresh and memorable sound!  Look forward to their next release!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Takes a bit to figure out what does what in the controls.  But you can make some very retty pictures.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Love this album....variety of driving, heady and nostalgic melodies.  A truly musical feast throughout the entire album. A great buy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun dodging jumping rolling and defeating this game applies the funny minions you know and love. You also get to hit vector.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great lyrics, punchy delivery and powerful arrangements - hallmarks of a great follow up to Sigh No More.  They continue to raise the bar.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I love the way Gillian Flynn writes!  Really good story,plot keeps twisting and turning and this ending is the best of all her books.<br />I've read all three of her books and this one's the best in my opinion.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I downloaded Minecraft Pocket Edition to my Android device and notice that you can only has building capabilities, that's it.  Nothing else, if you want to restart you would need to uninstall and reinstall.  If all you want is build a bit, that seems Ok, but there is no game in the Pocket Edition for Android.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love hidden pictures games so of course I downloaded this one. Its fun but it only gives you 10 levels which you go through quick if you have nothing to do but kill time.
B006AN78XS|4.0|A quintessential portrayal of man's attempt to escape myopia, only to change focus. Emotional and cerebral, yet inspiratonal. I enjoyed this movie with my teenage daughter.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun and gives you something to do. I like it because you have to concentrate on everything around you. This game makes you think and I love it! It is very challenging!
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Similar to game of thrones. As an American of Norwegian descent it has special appeal to me. My wife thinks it is good but not as good as Thrones. I have only watched Vikings and really enjoy it.
B009P3N1GI|5.0|The Emperor's Soul is a well written, imaginative story that helped me about originality, craft, love, magic and obsession in art.
B001EO748M|5.0|I love The Tudors....both this show and the family heritage....Showtime does a romantic and majestic portrayal of this dirty and brutal part of our world's history!
B007SGM084|3.0|I enjoyed this series but was a little let down that it was only from the womans perspective.  Also I did not find the 3rd book as interesting as the first 2 but all in all it was a good read
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|I didn't get anything out of this book and certainly wouldn't purchase again. It's over my head and makes no sense to me.
B009R659L8|4.0|As usual Ms. Higgins Clark writes a great book.  Her chapters are short and always engaging,  She is one of my favorites and I have read everything she has written.
B004811PMO|5.0|I adore this movie, and the songs are BIG and phenomenal. Gordon Macrae his singing is outstanding, with Shirley Jones as runner up. I laughed a lot and just felt happy watching this.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Ok for a freebie - no clues so have to just keep at it until solved - wouldn't have paid for it
B00124LYHQ|5.0|Absolutely loved this classic, and the acting by Marlon Brando, and Vivien Leigh was OUTSTANDING, Karl Malden, and Kim Hunter also gave stellar performances. A wonderful rendition of a classic.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|The whole family likes playing with this. Takes some time and concentration, but it is possible to make progress.  Fun.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Everything to love, and the enchanting voice of Julie Andrews, this took me back in time, and I found myself humming the old classic songs the next day. Wonderful movie absolutely wonderful.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I enjoyed every bit of this book. I savored it.<br />I did get a little boo-whooey when I read that I made it to the end.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Oh this is such an all time favorite which I had not seen for in forever, it took me straight back to my childhood, it just speaks to my imagination and I absolutely was thrilled
B004DCB62M|4.0|This is a great collection of the classic detective stories/mysteries. Those who have seen the resent movies of Sherlock Holmes will discover and enjoy the significant differences between in the presentation of the main two characters: Watson and Holmes. It is incredible, given the similarity in the development of the plot and the focus on logical deduction shared by all the stories ,  how the majority of them keep you interested in the plot.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I AM ENJOYING THE STORY.  AMAZON HELPED ME TO BE ABLE TO SET IT UP EASILY AND TO  LISTEN OR READ.  LOVE IT.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|This is a family movie that is actually fun for the whole family.  It has everything.  Great movie for family night.
B000SOZXJG|1.0|Will not buy another movie from amazon again and I will contact customer service for a full refund. This is my grandaughters favorite movie and we were both very disappionted.
B008Y79HE6|4.0|This is a pretty good movie.  It has a very interesting plot and many twists.  Good entertainment.  I recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not always a S. King fan, but this one put me on his fan list. Great book for history readers, those who enjoy fiction, and others who simply love a good book.<br />As a warning, it follows Oswald.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This was the 9th doctor and the &#34;reboot&#34; of Dr Who after being off the air for a few years.  David Tennant and Matt Smith have done such a great job as the Doctor it is easy to overlook Christopher Eccleston.  I know I did until I recently went back and watched this season again.
B001BANK32|4.0|I've never been much of a S. King fan, but have enjoyed reading a few of his books. The Shining is one of them. The book has it's secrets and turns upside down out of nowhere. Great peice to read, and as a young adult, I am ashamed to say that I had nightmares when I was reading this!<br /><br />-ENJOY!
0062255657|4.0|I can't deny it, I missed some hours of sleep reading \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\". However, I couldn't help myself linking almost everything in the book to previous Gaiman's work.<br /><br />Let's ignore the recurring Gaiman's motifs (three women of different ages living under the same roof, etc). What irked me instead was that the entire narrative backbone was more or less copied from one of his earlier books, which I refuse to name. Think for yourself:<br /><br />1. A young child strolls from its safe, though uncomfortable home, into its extended neighborhood, to find trouble;<br /><br />2. An attractive lady (actually a monster) shows up and spells/kidnaps the child's family, leaving the child not only endangered and scared, but feeling overwhelmingly guilty;<br /><br />3. The child finds itself trapped in a nightmarish environment, fighting for its survival and sanity;<br /><br />4. Friendly entities and objects help...<br /><br />But let me stop here. Every Gaiman's follower has already recognized the key elements of a previous work.<br /><br />What gives \\"The Ocean\\" added value is that it continues beyond the happy ending. The continuation is remorseful and it acutely deprives the reader of that familiar release, \\"The good has prevailed, the book has ended, life is good again.\\" The tale doesn't end this way. In fact, it doesn't end at all. Truly good books shouldn't.
B00BYISQTO|4.0|I was a very big fan of this record. I thought it was another solid effort from the National that continued in the direction of Boxer and HighViolet and while sonically it might not be that different, it's still a remarkable record. As always with the National it's a record that you have to live with. But taking the time to get to know the record leads to so many gems. Hard to Find is my current favorite
B001GUXJQA|4.0|I like the plot of the story.  But, the story is sad; I feel sorry for the traded-position sergeant, his miserable childhood.  Nevertheless, this should not be the reason for his greed.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|On this record Vampire Weekend finally grow into all the potential they had to make a classic record. I love every song on this record. The favorite changes daily, depending on what song I hear shuffle and its like discovering something great all over again. That being said, I really love Hannah Hunt, Finger Back, and Don't Lie. I think they're some of the best songs the band has ever done.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|I have an HP printer.  This app was not plug-n-play to my HP printer, and I still can't print stuff to the printer.  (I have this app on my Kindle).  I also have an IPod touch.  The iPod can connect to the printer, and print items, all without needing a special app.<br />On the plus side, this app is free, so you won't lose anything by trying it except your time.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This series seems to have a lot of repeats from season 1. But I just skip past them to see new shows. I enjoy this type of show and like the actors and the characters that they portray.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I am a Baldacci fan and again I liked the new character he developed in his book. I am yet to be disappointed in his novels
B006LSZECO|4.0|I love a good mystery but the writing style of this book is hard to follow at times and can be confusing at best. The plot of the book is great and the story is twist and turns throughout the book. I would recommend it to everybody.
B000MKD9P6|4.0|A movie that combines entertainment with social commentary, and focuses the light on the seductive allure of power and beauty, pairing it with social commentary. There are no excuses. You are not swept into total compromise of your values, you take little steps toward it, making choices and bowing your will to personal ambition and desire. There are rewards. There is also a staggering cost. A good movie to view as a family and discuss afterwards. The acting is superb.
B0089J270U|5.0|Trip down memory lane,,,great acting/music/script/cast/great movie,,, i could,nt wait to get this movie, turn the lights down, sound up, enjoy,,,,,,,,,,,
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Although we are not quite finished with this book, it has been an excellent read.  My youngest boy loves this series and we are slowly working our way through it one night at a time.
B003EI2EH2|2.0|The ideas in this book can work for you, but who the  hell wants to live that way ???  Definitely not for me. Waste of money.
B0026PA05M|2.0|Did not like this at all. I found these songs to be simplistic and boring - I'm all about women being sexually open but the theme of her feeling slutty gets old when it's the point of every song on the album. The vocalist has an absolutely amazing voice but it was largely wasted on these empty, soulless tracks.
B000I9UA30|5.0|Ever since this movie was released I have watched it around or on the 4th of July. It is just a fun movie to watch. I like Will Smith, I think he is one of the best, and he has more class in his little finger  than many other entertainers have in their whole body. This movie is what I think of when anyone thinks they have spotted an UFO. LOL No kidding Classic movie, good family movie, great entertainment. Fun to watch all year round.  Bill Pullman is one of my favorites too. I recommend this movie 100%.
B008V59AFW|5.0|Remaster sounds great! The live stuff from that time period good to hear too.Would rather have the live recordings than a bunch of other things from the studio thrown together that aren't as good as the finished album.
B008RKKUZ0|5.0|I love the<br />Addams Family, I grew up with them and so did my children, whats not to love. They are a classic family, well maybe not a classic family, but the movie is. I loved it and recommend it 100% . If you liked the show then you will love  the movie.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|Seeing &#34;Star Trek: The Original Series&#34; on blu ray complete with new digital effects breathes new life into an old classic, however, it was also very smart of the people behind this restoration and enhancement of all three seasons of &#34;ST:TOS&#34; to give viewers the option to view episodes with the original effects if they so choose. Personally, I really like the new effects, feeling it gives the entire series a consistency with the other series that followed. Unfortunately, no special effect is going to improve &#34;the cheese factor&#34; of just how cheap and cardboard-like in appearance many of the sets appear as well as the fact that one can now clearly see details not meant to be visible on much smaller, non-HD tv screens from the 1960's, such as a stray piece of thread sticking out from a costume or a spot on the floor of the Enterprise bridge or the corridor set where someone spilled some coffee or a bit of sandwich found its way to the floor to leave a permanent stain. One can only assume that some greater care was taken with the sets on the subsequent series. (I have yet to see similar &#34;marks&#34; on the floor of sets from &#34;ST: The Next Generation&#34; on blu-ray.) Also, the enhanced special effects are not going to improve some of the classically awful episodes of &#34;ST:TOS&#34;. (Season Three, I was reminded, is ripe with them. I used to think &#34;Spock's Brain&#34; was the absolute worst of the series until I viewed again for the first time in decades, &#34;The Way of Eden&#34;, in which Capt. James &#34;Herbert&#34; Kirk has to contend with space hippies. That one gets my vote for THE worst episode of the entire series. Other episodes that are still pretty bad but not nearly as grating are fun to see on blu-ray and the better episodes, particularly the ones that are &#34;effects-heavy&#34; such as &#34;The Doomsday Machine&#34;, &#34;The Immunity Syndrome&#34; and &#34;Elaan of Troyius&#34; are a delight, particularly when we aregiven close-up views of ships and seeing them maneuvering during battle. If you are a fan, (I hesitate to use the moniker of &#34;Trekkie&#34; or even &#34;Trekker&#34; as it has taken on such a negative connotation to many people), this set is strongly recommended.
0307887960|2.0|I have been on a paleo version of the Atkins diet for 6 months and have succesfully lost 20lbs. I bought this book to try and lose the last 5 lbs thinking that a new regime would shock my body into dropping those last few pounds. I followed the attack phase for 2 days and didn't lose anything. Moreover, I missed the addition of healthy fats in my diet and found that the diet contained way too much protein for my needs (I was averaging 150g/day on Dukan as opposed to around 80-100g/day on Atkins). Had I lost some weight during the attack phase, I may have felt compelled to do Dukan a little longer, however I soon tired of eating mostly protein, no vegetables and having to rigorously choose non-fat products with nothing to show for it. It made family meal preparation difficult too. Despite Dukan being low carb, I found that the recommended daily oatbran and all the non-fat yogurt prescribed sent my carb levels over 35g/ day which for me is too high for weight loss. I have returned to my 20g carb and 60% fat:20-25%% protein:5-10% ratio carb Atkins style paleo diet and feel much better. Plus the weight has started dropping again :-)<br /><br />For someone who has never done Atkins before Dukan might work esp. if you have alot of weight to lose. However, now that I've tried both I find doing my version of Atkins-paleo much more enjoyable and sustainable.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Head pounding drums drive this new Superman into the stars! My fav zimmer score to date besides Gladiator. Highly recommended
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|If you are expecting the John McClain of the first four movies, you will be disappointed. This is an okay action movie but a weak one.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Great show, great price, came quickly and in excellent shape. Will recommend to everyone I can. Will order from same carrier again and recommend it to others.
B000BBOV8U|5.0|Remastered song, the sound is as it should have been. Simply the best for BA fans, all his hits are here and more.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Great Movie,  I  enjoyed the concept and the way the  writers  tied in the  story line. Not  quite  the  Orgina but  close  enough. Special  effects were  good. watched it  three times so far.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This movie was great, and I am saddened to hear the bad reviews it received from critics. I am hopeful that there will be a sequel to this under-apprectiated film.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This the best game I have ever had on my kindle I love this app<br />It is a perfect game
B0050AV5MW|5.0|But read the books! I am currently half way through the second book in the series - so my comments only relate to what I've read so far. While there are some differences, the basic story and the characters are the same. Reading the book(s) you actually come to appreciate how good the casting of the characters in the TV series is. Of course the books are far more detailed - but just as gripping.
0425263908|5.0|Loved the two characters Eva and Gideon and I'm happy that I've got two more books to read... recommend it ... I thought it was a lot better than F/S and I'm thrilled to have found another good author.
B009GEYX5E|5.0|Nice to find film to use for my Polaroid camera. Great price too! I can always count on Amazon to have what I'm looking for!
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|Although, I have watched Batman several times I enjoyed watching again because I watched it with my 11 yr old granddaughter. A precious moment.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|After a few lackluster efforts the band is back. The infusion of new life into this band is evident. It seems like a short album and that's a good thing because the Dedicated to Chaos was too long by the second track. Keep it up guys!
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|I love the main character and liked the movie despite the crude humor.  It was not at all what I thought it would be like, and I was a little worried I would hate it.  However, the main character's reasons for doing what she does makes the movie enjoyable instead of one of those annoying high school movies (you know the ones where they try too hard and curse far too much).  Overall, a great buy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a little confusing without hints but this old bird will figure it out. I like the graphics .I'll be looking for simular games
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|It isn't spot on with the book, so for those of you that want it to be, it isn't.  However, still a great movie to watch if you can stand the differences from the novel.  The acting is amazing as usual and the dwarves are a great addition.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|I Like John Grisham novels, ,but I can identify with the characters. I grew up in a small town about that size. Grisham makes the characters honest and true to themselves and even trows in a little morality  lesson here. The ending was very good, but left me wanting more. That's what a grea writer does. It's like I'm watching this guy grow up little by little.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really like this game. Me and my eight year old play together all the time. Sometimes she is better than me at finding the clues.

4805311193|5.0|Very good book! Everyone who likes samurai and bushido must read this book. And remember one thing - Hijikata was AMAZING!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|People should get this app because it was free and I will be able to get all of these things like that in a way
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app has, so far, been enjoyable. It is quite similar, in some ways, to the online game called Howrse. One thing about this app I dislike, though, is your lack of ability to chose the gender, breed and coat of your horse. But nothing can be expected to be perfect. All in all, this app is quite good from what I can tell.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Great game. Love the tones. This game would be good for all ages. Simple enough for kids and can be challenging for adults.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Free game to download and since it appeared on my Kindle Fire HD ad screen I thought it would have been somehow prescreened and promoted by Amazon. In no time, however, it starts offering to buy this and that as if to alleviate your play and, finally, after you refused to buy anything, it wouldn't let you to play any longer if you don't buy something (I don't remember what it was, some game paraphernalia). I deleted it from my Kindle after 20 minutes from installation. I would not recommend this game for anyone.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King has done it again—and I have read everything he has published in book for so far. Less a horror story than a bildungsroman about a young man's growing up, 'Joyland' is a delight from start to finish. It seems to fall naturally into two parts. The first part describes the summer a young man spends working at an amusement park while trying to forget his first love, who has rejected him. In the second part the young hero continues to work through the winter at the same park, when it is closed to the public, bringing into focus a ghost story and a murder mystery that had been introduced but not developed in the first half of the work. In the end, though, the ghost story seems tacked on and unnecessary, while the murder mystery serves to function as a teaching device to bring the young man to adulthood.For the most part, the second part of the novel focuses on the hero's experience helping a woman and her invalid son. It turns out to be a teal tearjerker. The characters, as always with King, ring true and are (except for the villain) endearing. I loved it.
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|Cruise is definitely miscast here. The books are good but the movie is awful. For some reason Cruise is continually cast as some kind of superhero type character when the fact is that he comes across as a smarmy smirking punk in every role he plays. Maybe it's just his real character coming through because he can't act -- he just plays spoiled little smirking Tommy whatever the role. The only explanation I have for his apparent movie success is teenybopper appeal and this should not be a teenybopper movie. Skip it.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have used The Weather Channel app for several months and liked all of it's features and the intuitive screens; it was my weather app of choice. Today I fired up my Kindle Fire to see the app has been re-designed. Although I have found that most of the old features are still available, the allergy report (something I used daily) is gone. The navigation is somewhat clunky and it relies too much on the BACK arrow to get out of the VIDEO cul-de-sac since the navigation tabs disappear. The sections are also accessible by 'page-turning' the screen, but there is an annoying VIDEO section sandwiched between NOW and FORECAST. I suppose that is how the app makes it's money, but it is annoying anyway.<br /><br />The reason for the low rating, however, is that the app no longer turns off. Once it is launched, even if you shut down your Kindle Fire, upon re-start TWC will be active. In the earlier version at least you could shut it off by turning off the device. On the new version you have to go into the device settings and Force Quit the app. I REALLY don't like having to do that, and that was the main reason I dumped the Accuweather app. It is also the reason why my former 5-star rating is now a 2-star.
B00BH0VSM6|2.0|I have read every translated Harry Hole novel. The first three or so we're great and then seemed to peter out. I couldn't wait for this first one to be translated. Maybe I expected too much but for me it was nothing special. Nowhere near as complex as the later ones.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I have several pocket knives and this has come in handy. When I don't have the time to sharpen knives with the stone and oil I'll grab the pocket pal to put a nice edge on my blades.

B0099RFVXQ|3.0|I'm getting tired of over-the-top computer generated effects, they totally ruin the believability of this movie. Not worth paying for.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Although its 7 bucks its a really fun game. its good for kids who love legos and people who like to build. i think it diserves 6 stars. if you dont like this game you are an idiot.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|So I initially bought this mouse due to my old one finally giving up the ghost. I'd wanted a gaming mouse for a while, mainly for the extra macro buttons. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. So lets get right into the pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) The price. $40 for a gaming mouse? Not a bad price, when you take everything about the mouse into account. Personally, I think this mouse is on par with some of the big names out there, like Razer and SteelSeries, at a much more affordable price range.<br />2) DPI settings. I play a LOT of different games. From Minecraft to Borderlands 2 to LoL, they pretty much run the gauntlet as far as genres go. And I use a different pre-programmed setting for each, as well as one for general usage. Switching between the settings is literally just a click of a button. And you can have up to 8 different DPI settings, split between two profiles.<br />3) The form. While I feel this mouse is geared more twords gamers who palm their mice, I claw it, and I haven't had any real problems.<br />4) The thumb buttons. The positioning of the three thumb macros is perfect for me. It just takes the slightest twitch of my thumb to hit any of the buttons, and all the motions feel natural. I will say it does take some getting used to though.<br />5) Customizable LED. Cause who doesn't like making things pretty?<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) The weight. This is really the only legitimate, non-nit picky complaint I have about this mouse. Even with all the weights added in, it still feels a little on the lighter side to me. I will say however, that I work with my hands for a living, so I don't think I'm your average person when it comes to hand/wrist strength.<br />2) The thumb buttons. While I love the positioning, I feel they could use a little more resistance when it comes to clicking. I've hit them more than once while moving the mouse. This hasn't really affected me, but I feel it has the potential.<br />3) The form. This mouse is for right-handed gamers. This doesn't affect me personally, but it is definitely something to take into consideration when buying.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great mouse, for a great price. It serves it's purpose very nicely, and with all the customizable DPI settings, all but the twitchiest of gamers will love this mouse!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have read on a kindle. It is the story of what truly happens to people. But there were some parts when I found myself smiling, even through the darkness of the story, and I cried when it was over. I loved it and would recommend it to everyone I meet.<br />-Elphaba
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Good shit y'all. I've been waiting for this for the kindle for awhile. I prefer the old school rules and cards, but if you enjoy magic, it would be worth paying for the full version instead of the free one.
B004I744AS|4.0|whenever I'm trying to find the definition of a certain word and it can't be found in any other dictionary, I can go to this free dictionary and it's almost always there. ( 99% of the time, at least)  its nice to have this as a backup ...the reason I don't go here first is because of the small size of its print. it would be ideal and rate five stars if it just had a larger print size....Thanks Farlex, for a complete dictionary!
B00BM9WM2C|4.0|Another impressive recording by Bon Jovi.  The first song alone &#34;because we can&#34; is such a great song and is worth the price of the whole CD.

B00571F26Y|5.0|On advice from a relative concerned about my growing girth, I read \\"Wheatbelly\\" from Amazon and took it to heart.  Giving up my usual breakfast of fresh OJ, cereal and toast, I switched to OJ, 2 eggs and occasional fruit.  Could not believe I lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks and after 1 3/4 years my weight has plateued at a comfortable 16o  -down from 180 at the start.  AT 80 years, still active in tennis, skiing, golf and yard work thanks to seriously limiting wheat to occasional consumption like a hot dog or piece of bluberry pie.  Definitely Five Star!  James S

B0089LOKHG|4.0|My Review<br />Favorite Quote(s):<br />\\"But maybe happiness isn't in the choosing. Maybe it's in the fiction, in the pretending: that wherever we have ended up is where we intended to be all along.\\"<br />\\"This is what amazes me: that people are new every day. That they are never the same. You must always invent them, and they must always invent themselves, too.\\"<br />Favorite Character: Lena. She has really matured over the course of the series, and has learned to fight for what she believes in.<br />First Line:<br />\\"I've started dreaming of Portland again.\\"<br />My Musings: I have to start by saying that Lauren Oliver is a phenomenal author--The Delirium series is one that I've loved since the first novel. Requiem was no different. Oliver created a new world where love was a disease. And there were the resistors. Those who wanted, and fought for, the decision to choose.<br />  The writing and world building of this novel were very interesting. The concept of a loveless world was something that you don't see very often. The fact that Oliver was able to take that idea and make it her own is very inspiring. The prose itself was fluent. The story flowed very well, while switching back and forth between Lena and Hana's points of view. I immensely enjoyed Lena's narration, but it was hard to get into Hana's. That may be simply because she was living the life of a cured. Regardless, near the end, the dual narration came full circle, excitingly explaining simultaneous events as they happened.<br />  The thing that I enjoyed most about this series was the character development, mainly that of Lena. In Delirium, Lena is a rule follower. A meek girl who doesn't want to do anything wrong, but falls in love. This is quite possibly the best thing that could have happened to her, in my opinion. the journey that that set her on eventually made her a headstrong girl who wasn't afraid to fight for what she believed in. The boys, Julian and Alex were your typical book boys thrown into the love triangle that we caught a glimpse of at the end of Pandemonium.<br />  Hana, on the other hand, evolved a lot over the course of this novel alone. As a cured, Hana seems to care a little too much about things that she shouldn't, and that almost gets her into a lot of trouble with her seemingly perfect pair, Fred Hargrove, the new mayor. Although I didn't like Hana's chapters nearly as much as Lena's, it was interesting to see what the life of a sympathizing cured was like. I also liked seeing what was going on in the city, as Lena was in the Wilds for a majority of the novel. Some interesting things come out about things that Hana has done that were very surprising, but it all helped to further develop her character.<br />  The other characters were amazing as well. Oliver has a gift for making lovable, as well as hate-able, characters. The introduction of Bee was very very interesting to me...and I don't want to spoil anything so you'll just have to read the novel to find out about that one! I also loved all the others like Hunter, Bram, Tack, and Raven. They were supportive of Lena; they were truly a family. It was endearing to see a network like that. And our favorite boys. Boy is it hard to pick one of them! Alex, the rough, brave fighter, or Julian, the caring, sweet one? Unlike many love triangles, it was difficult to pick--there was no obvious choice. But for me, I am slightly more Team Julian. Sweet guys just do me in! It was interesting to see the two together and to see how they reacted to one another, all ending in a confrontation that I'm not going to tell you about! Julian's character really develops in this novel--he adapts to the life in the Wilds. It's not an easy transition, but his determination to do it to get Lena was really adorable. He really cared about her, and that was obvious over the course of the novel. Alex was a little tougher to read. After spending time in the Crypts and coming back to see my significant other with anotherperson would make me a little bitter as well. But eventually, thankfully, that hard exterior fades. Too bad we didn't see what happened after it did...Which leads me to the one thing that keeps me from giving this novel a five heart rating:<br />  The ending. I did not like the ending, personally. I felt as if it did not tie up the loose ends at all. What happens to Portland? What happens to Hana? Who does Lena chose? I feel like the ending left too many major questions unresolved. It was disappointing on my end, and I kept thinking that pages were missing out of my book or something. No such luck.

Too bad we didn't see what happened after it did...Which leads me to the one thing that keeps me from giving this novel a five heart rating:<br />  The ending. I did not like the ending, personally.

B0091WNK8M|5.0|The Goonies is a movie that I never get tired of watching. It is funny. A great to watch over and over
0425263924|2.0|I didn't mind the ending but was fed up with the constant sex instead of a storyline. I love the characters and wish she would have written more drama and depth with them. I can only take so many sex scenes before it seems too much like a book of porn. The fist 2 books were great, I hope she does a better job on book 4.
B003M70O5O|4.0|Season 2 moves along quickly and keeps you guessing wich way things will turn. Enjoying it so far. Will definitely continue to season 3.
1932735410|5.0|Everything needed for passing PMP exam is in this book. I highly recomend it. I had some problems with the delivery (or was it Amazon shipping), but the book is still great.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|loved this book couldn't get enough of Eva and Gideon and I so love Cary, I  love the complex relationships and  the way that they( Eva and Gideon) love each other to no end. I  can't wait for the next two.  definitely a do  over
B009MO5G90|4.0|Good 3D effects, brought back some of the old characters, lots of action.  If u like the series you will like this one.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I was thrilled to find the 2 season set available and have enjoyed many hours watching all the episodes from the very beginning.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|This sequel to Webber's amazingly popular Phantom of the Opera is well-staged by cast and crew, but the story, which takes place a decade after the Phantom destroyed the Paris opera house and escaped, is considerably more fragile than that famous falling chandelier. Maybe it's because the score isn't exactly music of the night. Maybe it's because the setting -- New York's Coney Island -- isn't exactly Paris. Phantom 2 is a far cry from the original.
B001BKVWYQ|5.0|I'm so glad that I was able to find this. Rodriguez is an excellent songwritter, vocalist, and overall musician. This record belongs in everyone's collection.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|The songs all travel around plastic, whether how essential it is, horrid for the environment or what is in our soul.  There merge so many formats together that at first I was put off a little. But the melodies, the sound itself is well thought out, intellectual, a varied in style and pace.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I didn't think I would like this... and I was pleasantly surprised. This is worth downloading and I can see playing this w/the kids.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had watched the first 2 seasons of Downton Abbey after a close friend told me how she enjoyed it.  At that time, Amazon Prime members could watch it for free.  That's all it took- I was HOOKED!  FINALLY season 3 became available for free for Prime members this past weekend.  I began watching on Friday night, & started again as soon as I got up on Saturday.  I got absolutely NO housework done, but I thoroughly enjoyed my weekend!!  Now I am anxious to see season 4!
0375842209|5.0|This is such a great book.  So well written and one of those books you really don't want to finish.  Characters so well developed.  Just a wonderful story
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Good season! Lots of different things going on for each of the characters.  Season ended making you wonder what the next season will bring.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|wanted to see what all the hoopla was about but this badly written piece of trash has stupid characters and no interest except for the silly s&m stuff which is, of course, the point of the book. I'm amazed at the popularity.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|This book has many basic concepts to show for an average socializer like myself. I have no problem with approaching people, but this kind of book helps me explain to myself why that is and even better, it helps me read another people who might be having trouble making through conversation with satisfactory success.<br />This is a easy and useful read for anybody, as we all face familiar and unfamiliar faces through our daily ventures.
B00BX3KZAS|5.0|COB gets past the last three mediocre releases and created an album truly worthy of the greatness of hatecrew deathroll. A fantastic album.
B00BFINHHE|5.0|i collect steelbooks and expect on delivery no damage. these dvd's were packed the way i would if i mailed them.<br />tks
B003YCI1O8|5.0|This movie is just priceless. One of my favorite movies in my collection that i can watch more than once.
B0053PTO7M|5.0|i collect steelbooks and am looking for no damage to the dvd or case. packaging is important to me and it seems it is also important to this seller. the items were as described, in perfect condition and the packaging we professionally done. tks<br />recommend.
B002HNA95E|5.0|I was at the supermarket and heard Express Yourself as background music on the store audio system.  I stopped and said to myself who the heck is this and where can I find it?  I asked a young girl in the fruit and vegetable section and she said she thought is was Madonna.  What! I am a 60 yr. old male and we don't listen to Madonna!  So I sheepishly purchased Celebrations and I am totally intrigued by the music.  It may not be ultimate collection in purist eyes but can say the Celebrations CD sound quality is excellent.  I own a decent audio system and have since also purchased a high-rez format (192khz, 24 bit) of Madonna's True Blue.  I much prefer the Celebration mixes of hits from high-rez True Blue.  In comparison Celebrations is more compressed but crisper and extended in frequency response.  Loud and proud the way the old girl is meant to be heard.  Never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever purchase a Madonna album.  But it is the best CD purchase in a long, long time.
B00A3WW2DI|5.0|i collect steelbook dvds. obviously i want them in perfect condition. these dvds were just that. great packaging<br />item as described. recommend. tks
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I am a 25 year old big kid. I love this game. Very addictive, I have sat and played it for an hour and then wondered where the time went.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was challenging to try to &quot;read&quot; into the mind of the developer. Wish there were more rooms to go through.
B008N2Z1L0|3.0|There's a few songs I like on it and the one's I like I really like. I could have just gotten those songs vs. the entire album, but was hoping I'd like more of the songs on it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|At first glance many might look past Fringe, but one willing to give it a chance will soon be hooked by the Fringe Division and their call to protect Homeland Security against ghastly and often gruesome scientific experiments meant to unlock the gateway to another parallel dimension. We watched all five seasons on television and are re-watching them now on Amazon. I have completely hooked my 5 children (4 of which are teenagers) and numerous friends of theirs (some on the other side of the world who watch it through Netflix). Definitely a disappointment when it was pulled of the &#34;air&#34;.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great to have and love checking on the weather before going to work. This way I can dress accordingly for the day.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I found this as a suggestion to replace Google Reader, and I wish I knew aboit it sooner. It is a fantastic RSS Reader with great features and enough flash to it to make it look slick without overdoing it. I like that it syncs accross all devices so when I want to read on the PC, or save an image to the PC and not tablet, I can do so easily.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B008ZCWFEE|4.0|This game is very fun and also addicting. I got through the entire game in about 45 minutes to an hour. It is also kinda frustrating because I got stumped on a couple of levels and you can't skip any levels. The game goes by so fast that I can't believe it costs what it does but it's really fun. On a review I found about this app, it said &quot;genius kids won't even know they are learning math.&quot; Well I guess I am a genius kid because I do not see how this app has any relation to math besides a few things looking like fractions but with pictures on them instead. Overall I think this is a great app and that you should get it.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I thought I would love it because I love movies about gladiators. I was sorry to here about Andy Whitfields death just as I became a big fan of his!
B00499NHLC|4.0|A excellent modern telling of the Sherlock Homes story. It kept my attention and I could not wait to see what happened next.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Built up a pretty large reef. Yesterday unable to open and today all gone. Guess I won't. be playing anymore.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|This game has kept me up at night. I can play it for hours. The game runs well on my evolution 4g. Quite addicting.
B006RJTIF6|5.0|THis is the best film ever on the whole issue of the military industrial complex and civilian society.  Needs to be discovered again in the current time
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Never a dull moment, read the book in one day, already ordered the rest of the trilogy. Nice easy read.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Yeah its fun. But for 15 minutes! I think they could add ANYTHING to it and it would be SO much better. Its okay.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|i hate the new format. hate! uninstalling. I just want weather not some ugly background I have no option to remove. my job i have to keep close eye on weather. I should have never updated it. it was fine.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Best headphone ever! I'll never regret this purchase, listening to surround sound music is awesome! Especially for DUBSTEP remixes. This headphone is great!
B001PSGF3C|5.0|Its been years since I saw it and now watching it again reminds me of how great an actress Halle Berry is.  She killed this role!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Playing this game is almost as fun as Jaws the game. Love eating everything in this game.especially when you become the Great White. Im just saving to become the megalodon shark.
B0096HIEE2|4.0|The movie had some pretty lame acting but it was nice to see some hot men dancing.  Its a great change from all the women used as sex objects. :-)
0517543052|5.0|Ram Dass wrote this forty years ago and it is still a basic for those studying eastern philosophy.  Read it now.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|I was told by someone to watch this movie.  It was quirky.  I thought that it totally spoke to issues in the family of a young man growing up and finding out who he is.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I loved this book and it also frightened me.  Alice's experiences are all too real - and I have had people with Alzheimer's in my family, so I could really relate!  It also makes me question my own level of memory which is un-nerving!
B00005JKLZ|5.0|great science fiction/adventure movie. This opens up the imagination and brings you to new and exciting places. Oh and orcs are not limited to lord of the rings lol
1616615362|5.0|this miniature is a beautiful sculpt.  it comes with additional cards and pieces that also serve as a nice expansion to the core X-wing set.  this ship is bigger than the others and has a rear firing arc, so it really mixes things up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this TV series.  Season three is just as good as one and two.  I look forward to season four.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO ADDICTING, I LOVE IT!!!!! I AM 14 AND I CAN NEVER STOP PLAYING THIS GAME!!! EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THIS APP!!!
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Love this movie!!! The singing...the weird story line. It's funny and has a great cast!!! Just can't say enough about it!!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|My kids love to make videos with talking Ben and upload onto YouTube. I feel confident to allow them to play with this cute and safe entertainment for them!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|It's good when a movie banks on the story instead of sex and the car chase. The plot was good the flow and actors did well!
B00BJLPAMW|5.0|This release is worth the money-if you have a SACD player. I closed my eyes and listened and I seemed to be in a small room listening to a live band, The sound was open and clean. The surround mix was amazing even startling at times. This and the first album are my two most favorite Doors releases. I also listened to it on my computer speakers (Logitech THX 2.1 Channel) and the sound in stereo was excellent, also.  I find myself wishing I could play the multichannel in my car as well-maybe someday if SACD goes mainstream. I also bought the first album, Morrison Hotel and LA Woman over a 2-3 week period. I tried \\"The Doors\\" first and that convinced me to get this one -and my wife-after listening to the first two, wanted Morrison Hotel, after which I went for LA Woman. I am not disappointed with any of them.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Drama, comedy and great actors. Looking forward to next season. Ten more words are required. All these expectations are inconvenient and make me not want to post a comment.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Ever since reading Wallbanger by Alice Clayton, I've been looking for another funny, steamy romantic novel. Tangled is IT! Told from a male prospective, it is hilarious. I have to wonder, did Emma grow up with a slew of brothers? Did she somehow live in a fraternity in college? She nails the dialogue and thoughts of a 20-something guy. The book does not end in a cliff hanger, but I am very happy to hear that a sequel is in the works. Check out Emma Chase's Facebook page for more of Drew Evens'  insights on life.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|This AMD A4 processor works better than I thought it would. This was my first try at a AMD chip set and I am very pleased. I would recommend this processor.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|I couldn't get through it.  I made it through maybe 30 minutes and then finally had to cut myself off.  Boring.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What an addicting show! Loved seasons 1 & 2! Loved watching it on Amazon!  I can watch it on my IPad while my kiddo takes a nap.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great performances, dystopia now, the story seems more relevant in the wake of NSA, IRS, etc. revelations.  Watched it twice and was just as good the second time around.
B006ISJQ1W|3.0|I usually love Johnny Depp, but, this time he drinks and he drinks and he drinks. I thought this film was about writing. Puerto Rico is very enchanting even from the eyes of a drunk journalist.  The ocean is beautiful. This film is just too long.<br />There are a few good scenes in the beginning. Christine C
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|Great for killing time or playing with your kids. You don't have to an amazing artist either. Reminds me of an etchosketch mixed with a spirograph.
B001FB55L2|3.0|The same story again. An older brother is so good according to the parents. Then, in the end we realize that none of these characters is good to follow. All the roles have make negative choices and said things that are unfair. Great Cast.<br />Poor story. Christine C
B006UV8DJS|5.0|This is amazing for turning a good picture into a great picture. Especially photos from mobile devices. Get this app!
B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|This is a very interesting look at the result of WWII and the sadness and tragedy that the Jewish people of Europe endured.  Their reaction becomes violent but they are looking for justice for their people. I was cheering them on to victory. Some things are surprising. This is for adults only. Great Cast. There is a twist that is not a positive part of the theme. I enjoyed it for the most part.  Christine C
0761169431|4.0|My kids are Star Wars fanatics! They are ages 10 and 12 and love this book.<br /><br />It has papers that are very cool in it that are preprinted with designs on them that make the folded figures look great. There are two copies of each of the designs - perfect for me - one for each child. The instructions are clear. There are several different levels of origami folding to choose from - easy to expert. My kids have done a few easy and intermediate and are perfectly capable of getting excellent results. The figures are quite good - the kids really like them.<br /><br />The big drawback is that the figures will look their best with the preprinted papers - plain paper will be a big let down once the preprinted papers are all used up unfortunately. One star down for the limited paper supply...<br /><br />Great for summer activities - family night, camping, sleepovers, playdates (to avoid the video game scurge), car rides, restaurant waiting - you get the picture.<br /><br />Good product - highly recommended!
B0059XTV4Y|3.0|This story is a little weird and it travels back and forth in time. I don't really see the connection between these characters. The flashbacks do not work. The clothes are beautiful. That is the best thing that I can say about this movie. Christine C
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I just received mu new charger today and it is awesome. I have been having a lot of trouble charging my Kindle Fire with a generic charger since my Kindle charger broke. I had to play with the charger and the Kindle to get it to charge. And then it would take forever and a day to charger. But that problem is solved now. I used the powerfast kindle adapted with this kindle cord and my Kindle Fire was fully charged in about 2 hours. Oh, and it was completely drained when I charged it.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Streisand and rogan! Come on you need to see it!<br /><br />The movie is very predictable / but delivers each prediction to its fullest!<br />It's funny, sad and well directed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm sure this game was at its prime when fb was live. But since its not you should be able to play with people from Twitter or instagram'!!! It's already a good game that would just make it better.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|My least favorite of what is now the second in a &#34;trilogy&#34;! But it's still GREAT!<br /><br />The 3rd iron man is my favorite and of course the first is a MUST!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Classy Seiko that can be worn with anything and look good.  Nice, readable face.  I paid $7 more than current listed price so I guess this is a pretty good price for this product.  And I bought it only a week ago.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|It was all lost on me!<br /><br />Only rented it because of Tom hanks but even he couldn't bring this movie out of whatever warp hole it fell through.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Don't get this game on the old one you got to go on peaceful and play with your friends. I hate this app!!!! It sucks!!! Don't get this app
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|Do not remember watching this movie!<br /><br />I love wahlberg and Crowe so how could I have fallen asleep??<br /><br />Maybe I didn't?
B001BANK32|4.0|Recently reread this after many years and it still holds up as a great thriller. King is a master at letting his readers peek into the mind of his characters and this is no exception. And with these characters ...well, lets just say that it's a heck of a ride!
B0095P31L6|3.0|Animation is excellent, story is good, some minor slow parts.<br />Some funny moments, characters can be even better in a sequel.<br />Soundtrack good.<br />I think children would love it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I truly love this show. Harvey is such a great character. Mike is funny and a great character as well. They work well together. This show is great they do funny well and serious well and everything in between. I recommend it to anyone.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Being a lover of musical theatre and the NYC theatre life, I thought it was a thrilling way to learn more about the business and how it all comes together.  Quite honestly, I don't know how they kept cranking out original music and choreography week after week! At times a little heavy, but we loved it in our house!
B009CG29RK|5.0|Absolutely delightful! The whole family loved it...I wouldn't mind watching it over and over again. The Minions are my favorite characters!
B000SEFCD8|4.0|A mixture if science and the observations of a true dog lover. You will find some gems in here, both in advice and anecdote
B00BBIAB0Y|5.0|THIS and Short Victorious War together with Shadow of Saganami are my favorites from the whole story. They give a depth to Honor and the others and really set the stage for the entire Honorverse
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great opportunity to look up your e-mail. Easy access if you need to right now and don't have a computer but have a kindle fire or something else. I love it.
B00000G3I2|5.0|the cast is amazing, this dvd has a documentary about the actors and making the movie, if you're a fan, its definitely worth watching
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Very helpful to use on kindle fire and my phone. Especially when I don't have a computer to use. It's a great opportunity.
0800141660|5.0|I love this.  I purchased this as a gift and have decided that this is the easiest<br />shopping I have ever done.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is a fun, challenging game but a bit complicated and confusing.  Plus, to really advance, you have to buy things.  Could use a bit more instruction on how to use collected items.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the challenge and my son was fascinated by how the objects were hidden. It helped me see things differently.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|My favorite, I watch it all the time. I just need to buy it. I rented it enough times. Lol
159420411X|5.0|I thought this book was really excellent, and important at a time when many people express far too much confidence in their predictions. I found Silver's emphasis on acknowledging our lack of knowledge refreshing, when so many people try to boil the entire world down into certain universal paradigms.<br /><br />Here's what each of the 13 chapters are about, each of them relating to the overall theme of prediction:<br /><br />1. The Great Recession<br />2. Politics<br />3. Baseball<br />4. Weather forecasting<br />5. Earthquake prediction (or lack thereof)<br />6. Macroeconomics<br />7. Epidemiology<br />8. Bayesian reasoning<br />9. Chess<br />10. Poker<br />11. The stock market<br />12. Climate change<br />13. Terrorism<br /><br />If you're interested in any of these topics, or if you like reading Nate Silver's blog, there's something in this book for you.<br /><br />Silver makes extensive use of endnotes, which keep the main text accessible while providing additional information for people who have a more academic interest in the subject at hand.<br /><br />It was published in early 2012, so a couple of things are slightly out of date, although they are minor. For example:<br /><br />-Some of the work of Reinhart and Rogoff, which Silver cites, has been found to have errors.<br />-Intrade, which is discussed in Chapter 11, no longer exists.<br /><br />Also there's a few typos here and there, but they don't really detract from the book's overall message.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|If you have not discovered Altucher Confidential, you are missing out on a person who has been there and done that. Choose Yourself and the Daily Practice are words/ stories that inspire.  Today I'm grateful that I read the book and I will try and spread the word.  JA many thanks and please keep writing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I find it amazing that Gillian Flynn can write so well about very twisted personalities, because all that I have read about her is that she is a pretty normal (whatever that actually means?) person. This book is &#34;refreshing&#34; as it is not only a who-done-it, but also a profile of a psychologically &#34;challenged&#34; person.  If you enjoy trying to get into the minds of these people and discover how they think, you will enjoy Gone Girl.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|would not load well or play on my kindle fire. glitchy and jams up during game play. my 4 yo and I are disappointed.
B001ER4CNY|4.0|The older seasons are the best.... Seems like they ran out of things to do after a few seasons but it's still a fun show.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I am not sure what Michael was thinking with this particular album. He is trying to be something to everyone. The lyrics for his original songs are horrible. It is highly obvious that he is trying to break through to a more POP audience. I guess I cannot blame him, but for his diehard fans I can only believe that this album will be a MAJOR disappointment. There are maybe 3-4 songs worth downloading, and that is being generous, the rest are worthy of the trash bin. I am totally bummed...I want more of the \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" Michael back! He has lost his identity on this album.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Well another great app was just ruined. I've had this and totally loved it for the last 2 years. Would've given it 5 stars. Tonight some update completely changed the interface and background making it a piece of crap app I will be deleting as soon as I'm done with this review. So long Weather Channel. Can't tell you how furious I am you screwed this one up!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Kept me entertained the entire time! Really wished they would have added more levels. Looking forward to more levels and the levels getting harder.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book, I have four children (all grown now) but I could see my husband and I defending any one of them like this.  No parent wants to believe their son or daughter would be capable of anything like this.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun game, haven't made it all the way through, yet. I need ten more words to get out of this comment section.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As I am only 15, this is the best, most well written book I have ever read in my life.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was disappointed with this book because I was so excited about the supposed third & final book in this series...but surprise!!  After a full book of a rambling story line that really went no where and ended very abruptly, we learned there are going to be more books!!  Well, the joke is on you Sylvia because you won't get any more of my money because I no longer care about Eva & Gideon.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|great video work and unusual concept, enjoyed the movie even the love story. will recommend this to friends on Facebook etc, 4 of five stars.
B007MDB71O|5.0|GREAT MOVIE! Here's your chance to check out the film based on the \\"John Carter of Mars\\" series of books (written over 100 years ago) that George Lucas himself mined material from to create his \\"Star Wars\\" saga. \\"John Carter\\" was criminally under-seen when it came out last year but it is an awesome movie, don't pass this one up! Amazing sci-fi epic about finding your humanity and discovering the hero within.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|The best of Gladwell's books.  He demonstrates through examples and research that there are no \\"self-made men.\\"  Those who achieve prominence in their fields do have talent and ambition, but they also had a break, or opportunity, along the way that allowed them to achieve.  There are people whose talent is wasted because they didn't have the same opportunities. Very interesting teading.
B00AFZ86BA|5.0|As good as it gets for 80's hard rock. Warren dimartini underrated as lead guitar. Maybe eddie van halen the only one better from the 80's.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game can play for hours, had to use walk through for a few  because these things can get tough
B0001I562I|5.0|It was very fun watching this movie again. It remembered me my childhood. Even if you didn't watch it back then you gotta go for it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great writing and acting with wonderful details in every episode.  I can't wait for the next season to come back!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Fantastic viewing the second (or even third, fourth etc) time around! Not for kids, though, or the faint-hearted, but perfected for those who love seeing bad guys get dished out.
B0038ZITIE|4.0|Great seller...a film favorite of mine...compare with the original comic strip and the early serial films...something of a cult classic by now.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|Since this obviously wasn't for me, I have to rely on feedback from the family.  They say their baby loved it...so I guess it was a good gift!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I got into the Castle series through my family in California, and since I saw the first few episodes, I've been hooked. Amazon was able to receive my request and payment the first day, then ship it and have it to my house the second. I highly suggest you order anything through this website, as the people who are in charge know exactly what they are doing!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Took a little white to get into it, but once I did, it was great!!!  It was a reading for our book club and it made for a great discussion.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Too hard to earn enough coins for expansion or crew and lottery game is random. Gameplay is fun. Tutorials are helpful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is for horse lovers. You get to go to competitions, take pictures of your horse, and play games with it.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I like all her songs.  It is very nice & touchy songs.  Don't take my words.  You have to listen to them.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is one of the best medival fantasy books i have ever read. Thanks mrs.d for introducing it to me
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I totally love this series and the author's writing. This book is always being compared to the Fifty Shades of Gray books however I loved the way Sylvia Day brought in other characters and made them just as much of the story as Gideon and Eva. I have read all three books at least three times and can't wait for the next one to come out.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Just amazing all around had me from start to finish<br /><br />Just can't wait for the forth book just have to play it out in my head for now
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I'm new to the game so it has taken some getting used to.  It's ok but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Need to have skin packs and some more cool dlc and more vehicles the bat boat would be cool. And more villains
B004IPPINW|4.0|Hamid's first person narrative tells the story of a young investment banker whose Pakistani upbringing collides with his Ivy League education and high powered career when the Twin Towers collapse and he comes face to face with the ironies and hypocrisy of his western life.  Mind opening and powerful!
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I am very happy for my choice made'', the clock is very nice and I got a very good price and I was delivered in a very short time
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini lives up to his recommendation with a wonderful story of love, loss and great sacrifice told through unusual and complex characters.  Excellent read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a exciting, fast paced game that keeps you coming back for more. I like the clearity and quick response time when moving in a certain direction. It works every time. I would suggest this game to anyone wanting a challenge to be better and better and never bored.
B000059H98|5.0|Made a while back TANK GIRL has a timeless message done with great music & visuals. It is a CLASSIC! Not just a cult classic.<br />Pretty much everyone should see it!
B000BDLJBU|5.0|I love how this is right angle but the only thing i have a qualm with is that it will giggle a little bit like the plug it self will move slightly.
1623420148|5.0|What a great book! Hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing, which caused strange looks from my family...lol. One of the funniest I have read in a long time! I absolutely adored this book from start to finish! Loved how the book started, it was a wonderful change to see things from a males point of view. Laughed all the way through and so fell in love with Drew. He was talking right to the reader, drawing you into the moment like you were sitting there having an everyday conversation with him. This was a new concept, hearing the tales of woe and love from a hot guy, he takes you through every step. You could sympathize with all the emotions Drew expresses. Simply loved the whole concept and story line! The chemistry between Drew and Kate is explosive! This is an author I definitely will be following...kudos Ms. Chase for a wonderful debut book! I can't wait for the next one in the series!!! This is a MUST HAVE BOOK!!! You'll love!
0393343405|2.0|I should have liked this book because I agree with the premise. But this book is so smug! The writer displays a pompous contempt for the reader so strong and so pervasive that what should have been a great book is a deadly boring one.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like hidden object games. This one has a lot of components. There is a long learning curve. Do not give up too soon.
B00957T6X6|2.0|They could have done a much better job with the packaging here.  As others have noted, all the books are jammed together, the page numbers don't match up, and navigating between books is difficult.  A box set e-book could and should be delivered as a series of files or at least be navigable as such.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This was a great novel when you get past a certain point.  Reliving the same day over was difficult to read.  However, when the novel finally got going, it was fabulous.  I never would have dreamed that was what was really happening!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I have played the first Quell and enjoyed it casually.  This version has many more features, achievements, and levels.  It's worth it.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I'm not much for action-type movies, but this one had me thinking. Would watch it 2 or 3 more times.
B00CTKHXFO|4.0|game is great of course but I purchase this game for the artbook... and usually the accompanying artbook is usually good..but this one... its like looking through a target/walmart/costco brochure...
B00973902K|4.0|Carly Rae Jepsen conveys how girls can be strong and flirty all at the same time.  This song does have a problem by getting stuck in your head.  A great beat and melody.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This was an entertaining and enjoyable read.  I would recommend this book to others that are interested in the subject matter.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This was my first encounter with Brandon Sanderson and I have to say that I loved it! While the story was rolling, he managed to built the characters, give us their history and motives, make us feel for them. The book was both surprising and believable.<br /><br />I loved the brisk pace but that won't stop me complaining that the book wasn't long enough - I could have handled more from my end of the story ;-)
B00280LYHS|4.0|This was an entertaining and enjoyable read.  I would recommend this book to others that are interested in the subject matter.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Loved the cast!  A little violent, but was softened a bit with the comedic relief.  Started a little slow, but once Helen Mirren joins the gang, they are rockin' and Rollin' and it's all action until the finish line!
B00280LYIM|4.0|This was an entertaining and enjoyable read.  I would recommend this book to others that are interested in the subject matter.
B008M7JODC|5.0|I'm hooked! It's very sci-fi meets modern medicine. What modern medicine does today would seem like science fiction 100 years ago, so it's fascinating to look into the potential of medicine merged with some seriously advanced physics.
B000I9X668|5.0|I find the characters to be eerily accurate, albeit exaggerated for the sake of humor. I can relate to the main character so much, it would be sad, if it wasn't so hilarious. Two thumbs up!!
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|I do like this app, it is very cool, very pretty and pretty unique the things you can do with this. I do think that I saw  a &#34;pro&#34; App that one would need to pay for. I'm mot sure as I did not look further because I do not pay for game apps.This would simply be for me to play with, like any game app. Like I said, I like it but....it needs more.  If it had something allowing text, I would like it no buts, and then  to make a page out of it, I would then love it.  There are other things that I'm sure that the makers of the Flowpaper app are aware of. I'm just to give an opinion. : )<br />I'll keep the app as I can kill time with it if I'm waiting in a dr's office, or some other appointment I might be stuck waiting on.
B00493E1GI|5.0|As with most films which are based on books, I think the book is better, but I still love this movie. It inspires me to travel and fully enjoy life instead of waiting for it to happen.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Well done movie! Didn't know about how our friends up north helped bring some of the hostages home. Thank you Canada!!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|This series in interesting but I didn't care much for most of the actors - If the seasons continued I would watch it but hope they would add more interesting people and sub-plots.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Goyte is a fresh group, a little quirky, but i like that. The CD has some really good songs.  Pretty cool.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a wonderful, wonderful series - so many interesting plots and sub-plots. Great actors and so much happening in every episode !!!  Although I am saddened and horrified by the ending, I can't wait to see the fourth season !!!
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|Joe can show artist how to stay revelant while staying true to who he is!!! Go head, get it! You won't be disappointed.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|If you've committed to read the first three books the 4th will not disappoint you.  More drama and fun to come I'm sure
1451629192|5.0|I believe this young girl wrote a very truthful account of what had happened to her.I admire her courage and how she is handling the circumstances that are a part of her future
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I really liked this.  I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood though. Clint stays in the character true fans have come to recognize and love
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Decided to read this book up at our cabin.<br />Great, quick read. I couldn't put it down!<br />This book is for anyone who has a heart! :)
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Best app ever I bought and I was so amazed by what it could do to your minecraft worlds first you can change your game mode from creative to survival or survival to creative I use it a lot also the upgraded version is even better .....note this app can only be purchased on Amazon I told my friend about it and she searched her Appstore on  her I touch  but it didn't come up with the app but this game is AWESOME:)
B00CTKHXFO|1.0|The code to play Metal Gear Solid 1 , and the first 2 NES games does not work. I entered the code multiple times and it never accepted it
159463176X|2.0|Wow, after reading his first two books, I was excited to begin this book. Initially, the story was rich and engaging. Unfortunately, as the book progressed, more characters appeared so much so that the storyline began to unravel. I had trouble following the storyline as the writing became very descriptive and frankly, boring. I finished this book last night and looked here to see feedback. I wasn't surprised to see many 3,2,1 stars. Like the title, the story is nebulous and not all that exciting.
B00170F0WU|3.0|As named in the title, he should be a cold-blood killer just for money.<br />His shooting spree is cool and deadly.  Okay for this movie.<br />His kind heart for a neighboring teenage girl survived from a massacre, is questionable.<br />His love and sacrifice rather than no-money-revenge is unacceptable.  Not practical.<br /><br />The teen does not go to school until this movie ends.  She knows who kills her family.<br />She directly approaches her family-killer in office environment.  No sense.<br />This professional killer feeling the danger, rushes to rescue her.  Not convincing.
B001QC6QRC|4.0|Not the deepest movie ever but the kids seem to love it. It is Fun for ages 5 - 10 after that they could get bored.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I know what I'm getting into with a Tarantino film. I know they are violent. Often over the top, almost comically violent. I didn't have a problem with it in Kill Bill, but I did have a problem here. I don't want to provide any spoilers but there are two scenes in particular, one with fighting slaves, and one involving a dog, that I just found to be over the top. Both the violence and the indignity of the situation. And I'm sure that's the point, but the point could have been made without actually showing the events themselves.<br /><br />Otherwise I enjoyed this movie though it could probably have been helped by some extra editing.
0783231032|5.0|One of John Belushi's best, I put this one up there with Animal House, very funny. Sad we lost Belushi at such a young age, great comedian.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Very educational. I expected the book to be a little dry, but each chapter covered something very different from the last and was very interesting.
B004E547D8|5.0|All star cast makes this a great movie to watch, really funny with lots of action. One of Bruce's best by far.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't get enough of Gideon!! Christian Grey has nothing on Gideon Cross! Cannot wait for the book #4 & #5!
B0010AN7Z4|4.0|Fred is a good as a jerk, Shirley is adorable as the naïve bimbo and Jack plays the overly nice guy to the hilt, as always.  Corporate America is not painted in a very good light here but a kindly neighbor balances things out nicely.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Perplexus Epic is a real challenge and a lot of fun for all ages!  It works just like it is supposed to and requires a steady hand and utmost concentration to move the little ball along the right path.  Both our grandson, 10, and his dad pick it up constantly to see if they can better their previous attempts.  Very worthwhile!  This has led to the purchase of two other Perplexus puzzle balls for two other grandchildren.  Highly recommended!
B0002DB52M|5.0|The director has an ugly view of America and in this film virtually everyone's character is tainted with the Director's negative perceptions of Americans.  Depression-era story of unlikeable people mistreating a visitor to their tiny &#34;town.&#34; This is NOT a feel good movie. Kidman would later claim she felt the director abused her, you'll see why.
B002KGEORM|5.0|This season has so much action it will keep you on the edge of your seat. So much drama going on with all the cast. I LOVE Jax!!!
B000EXDS5M|5.0|I am not a western movie fan with few exceptions (like Eastwood's westerns). This romp is hardly a traditional John Wayne-type of 19th century untamed West and we're all the better for it.
034580404X|4.0|Good summer read....not intellectual......just plain romance/sexy novels. Not much of a plot until book 3. I can understand why the author has been so successful....she has the right formula for sensationalism.
B00G8P2B4E|4.0|Mike desires to be a &#34;scarer.&#34; The monster world is powered by screams. The problem is that Mike (Billy Crystal) while smart, isn't scary. He attends Monster University where he studies hard to be a scarer. The plot reads like &#34;Revenge of the Nerds&#34; as Mike must win a scare contest along with his hopeless fraternity to prove himself and stay in school as a scarer.<br /><br />Mike is a rival to Sullivan, a university legacy (John Goodman) but later they operate on the same team.<br /><br />The film is cute. The initiation scene was my favorite with a laugh out loud chuckle.<br /><br />One the kids enjoyed ages 5 and up.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked the uniqueness of this story, which is primarily what kept me interested. It's so different from any other love story that I've read before. Matthew Quick does a great job of allowing the reader to see things from the perspective of a mentally ill person through his remarkable writing skills.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|The film opens with four quick character introductions of \\"street\\" magicians. Daniel (Jesse Eisenberg) uses street magic to meet pretty women. His former assistant Henley (Isla \\"Legs\\" Fisher) does a stage act. McKinney (Woody Harrelson) is a hypnotist who uses his ability to shake down people. Jack (Dave Franco) uses his slight of hand to pick pocket people.<br /><br />The four are summoned by Tarot cards (Lover, High Priestess, The Fool, and Death) to a common location. After the credits they become the world's greatest stage magicians while performing crime. They are followed by FBI Dylan (Mark Ruffalo) and Interpol Alma Dray (M&eacute;lanie Laurent). Meanwhile Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) is exposing their seemingly impossible tricks on the Internet.<br /><br />The film keeps you interested as to their next trick. The movie drops clues as to what is going on, but again there is the classic misdirection here too. It is s fun popcorn action film filled with mystery, drama, action, and humor.<br /><br />Parental Guide: One f-bomb. no sex, or nudity. Some sex discussion. Woman in bra.
B002WJI63A|5.0|when i got this plush in the mail i was so happy. It was soft<br />and it was the great size i have a big collection and she made it complete
B001VLXNO2|5.0|Although this is a novel, many facts were adhered to and it is a really good read. Ideal for anyone that loves outdoor adventure tales or mountaineers.<br />Even though we all know the end it keeps you gripped and is hard to put down.<br />My first Jeffrey Archer.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|nalini Singh, delivers every time,the stories get<br />more and more exciting. she is definately my favorite<br />paranormal writer, Would like to read more of the<br />Archangels series
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC News Kindle Tablet Edition. I like this news app. It gives you the world news plus the US news.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game isn't bad. Everything costs a ton of coins so unless you play constantly, you aren't making enough to build all the things your quests tell you to build. It is kinda fun though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Yay! This game is one of the best puzzle games I have played in quite a while.  I enjoy the challenge this game brings in determining how to use the clues separately or together in order to escape the room.  Super fun!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the book... I couldn't stop reading the book because when I tried at the end of each chapter... It got interesting and I couldn't stop...
159463176X|4.0|This is the first book I have read by Hosseini.  I really enjoyed the book, the story, and the style of this writer.  The first 3/4 of this story were perfect but later chapters left me feeling as though I had picked up a different book.  I would prefer he had taken more time to introduce the new characters and explain without giving away the twists, who this character is.  All in all, I very much enjoyed this book and unlike other reviewers I never felt like I didn't want to finish the book or lose interest in the story.  I really enjoyed it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I Only have had the game for about 20 minutes and I like it is fun and entertaining you should get it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible is excellent. It is a priced possession. It is a recommended must have for all and sundry. Thank you for this priceless gift.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I have always loved this show.  We need to bring it back, so that we can see what Aiden has done while growing up.<br /><br />I have Seasons 1, 4 & now 5.  I will be purchasing Seasons 2 & 3 soon.<br /><br />Joann
B0090SI4OC|5.0|It a modern day love story, but not in the normal sense. The alien has lived for century's and becomes friends with the girl, whose body she has control of.  She even falls in love with a human boy. I just loved it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Could not be happier, except I was really upset when Matthew was killed.  It will be very difficult to replace him.  Let me know when Season 5 is available and I will for sure order it. John Hedges
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I'll admit that I was a little skeptical about the premise, but I absolutely loved this movie.  It has an awesome mixture of dry humor, action, and romance.  Nicholas Hoult is just perfect as the brain-eating-but-soulful zombie lead, R.  I am still a little confused about how they managed to make a zombie sexy, but they did.  Theresa Palmer strikes a great balance as strong, smart, and sensitive Julie.  I really loved that she wasn't passive--she sticks up for herself and doesn't sit around waiting to be rescued.  The plot clicks along and the soundtrack is fantastic.  This is a definite win.  I already ordered the DVD.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not bad, not great, but not bad. Needs more levels to rate the game higher. Fun though. Not real challenging, but fun.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Unless you find super slow mo gorgeous blood-water-and-light cascades sexy. Karl Urban (who is not the same person as Keith Urban, it turns out) is a damn handsome man, as anyone who's seen Lord of the Rings can attest. You never see his face in this movie. Olivia Thirlby's cute, but she's covered in body armor. Lena Headey, of Game of Thrones fame, is, um, let's just say they have de-prettified her and leave it for now.<br /><br />The movie is what it is: It's a relatively short (just over 90 minutes in an era where blockbuster films often top 2 hours) suspense/action movie that does not probe too deeply into the inner life of its characters, explore lofty themes, or get bogged down in super intricate plot twists.<br /><br />That said, it's really good! The visuals are beautiful. The plot is tight. You give a damn about (some of) the characters. There ARE hints about them having some depth, but the movie is kept tight, so there aren't rambling subplots dealing with those depths. And you find yourself really hoping the good guys win and the bad guys get it.<br /><br />It's 94 minutes and might run you what? 4 bucks? Rent this on Amazon the next time you manage to get the kids to bed on time. Microwave some popcorn. Invite your friends.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is one of the best games I own, I recently bought it for my PlayStation and this app is very similar to the console version. I LOVE IT. PLEASE BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO :)!!!!!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This series was great! Can't wait for season two!<br />Very realistic and could happen!<br />Enjoyed the suspense and the action!
B00338QENI|3.0|Too much repetition about the cells and the family being uneducated regarding the medical and science.  The after story was almost another book.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|I got the book looking for a good computer thriller, what I got was an excellent thriller that happened to have computers involved.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Great books can't put them down.  I really like the different perspective from all of the American novels out there.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Rick riordan hit another homerun with the last Olympian. An amazing book with twists and turns all through it with an epic ending.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Another great writing work by Dan Brown...always intriguing, always engrossing, always captivating, love his work!  More Please...<br />The Lost Symbol
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Very action packed but too graphic for kids. I would recommend it to adults. It was very interesting to me.
034580709X|5.0|Finally, the long wait is over, US fans of Jo Nesbø's Inspector Harry Hole series are now able to read how it all began.  The Bat, the first book in the Harry Hole series has been released and for long time readers of Nesbø's series it is interesting to see a much younger Harry Hole in Australia trying to stop a serial killer.  After reading the other eight books in the series, it took a little getting used to this version of Hole, as I had already grown with this wonderful character, however I am very glad The Bat has been released into English and highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who enjoys well written Scandinavian noir, and most especially to fans of Nesbø's series.  The Bat is expertly written and lets the reader finally see how it all began.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I usually wait 3 months to reply this, the masterpiece of his life.<br />I tired, sick and weary man the end of his life<br />singing his muffled voice and heart out, is ferocious<br />Just when you think, when the man comes around is his best song ever,<br />he devastates you with a version of hurt that transcends song and music<br />to the level of personal pain regrets and finally acceptance of his fatal illnesses and the death of his wife<br />the rest are between great, good and acceptable.<br />Rick Rubin gets it.<br />It was never about the voice<br />Like Sinatra or Warren Zevon<br />it is about the songs and the absolute believability<br />of the total investment of the singer to the song
125000098X|3.0|Book one was great, book two was good, but this third in the series was a let down.  Boring at parts.  I don't know if there will be a fourth one but if there is I will read it as the end was unfinished in this book.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I HOPE to read more on this subject. I PLAN to read MORE BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR if they are available.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great app. Classic tiles and good constructs. Well done.<br />Worth the charge for the challenge. Great visuals on the tile surfaces. So far good pacing through the tile sets.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I hate to say it but this game keeps me entertained for hours, my friends seem to enjoy the game as well...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't stop watching, I wish there was a season four that I could move on to right away. Keeps you thinking. Very well played out.
B004UPANGM|5.0|The origin of the &#34;Groovy Bruce&#34; moniker, this is a cult classic.  My wife had never seen this movie, and it was great to share with her!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite shows ever.  Great casting, great story. I would recommend this to everyone and do.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Over all its great few miner tweaks but other than that I love the game great levels and the graphics are better than most of the same kind of Diablo style games
B00B4804KS|5.0|I was just a 20 something year old when I saw this in the theaters and it was incredible! The digital characters were of quite good quality for that time as well as the animatronics they used with the digital images. The cast was solid and the humor to scary scene ratio was perfect. This remastered 3D version updates this movie perfectly for my children to enjoy it as well! The only thing I can compare this movie to as far as epic adventure movies go would be Transformers 3! But that is only because of Transformers 3 was 3D. The first transformer movie had better writing and so that movie is more comparable to this in that aspect.
B0069JBKHI|4.0|After doing months of research, my husband and I finally decided to purchase the Withings monitor system because it had everything we wanted: two-way communication, music, and (most importantly) wi-fi capable so we can could see our child when we're outside of the home. While our child hasn't been born yet, we've played with the system & works just as described.<br /><br />We are disappointed in the purchase because Amazon LLC said it was a &#34;NEW&#34; item, but when we opened the box there were no directions included (which we simply thought was a mistake, so we looked them up on the manufacturer's website) and someone else's information was always imputed into the system. It had someone else's child's name, their date of birth, email address, wi-fi info, etc. I immediately deleted all of their information just in case they could still be connected to the system. Very disappointed that it was not actually NEW but was already used. We would have returned it, but we're less than a week away from our due date and don't want to take any chances of not having one when our daughter is born.
B002BWP49M|4.0|My favorites in this series are still the first film and New Moon. I haven't watched this DVD yet, but I'm sure the sound and picture quality will be excellent. I'm an older fan but have taken the ride with all the other family members in  enjoying this entire series. I hope the author finds a way to bring them all back one day soon. Maybe the Cullen family versus Zombies or something, ha ha.
B0035G0U2O|5.0|I love this movie. It has a lot of action and a great story line I was very happy to see that I could purchase this movie for a very low price and streaming it on my kindle fire.
B001PBEJL4|5.0|This movie has always ranked in the top five of my favorites. The love triangle, myth, legend, and history, all blend together to make a marvelous viewing experience. Many of the songs are timeless and the acting is top notch. I consider it the best performance ever for Richard Harris and I have seen most of his films. Supporting cast is on the mark. Some say the director's close up shots are overdone, but I think they do well to convey the true emotions and heartbreak of King Arthur, who spends much of the film in anquish over the love affair of Guenivere and Lancelot.  Skip the critics. If you are in the mood for a nice romantic movie for a Sunday afternoon, pop this one into the DVD player and enjoy!
B003TOS93O|1.0|I received two of the same discs for this double live album.<br />I have just disc 2 missing disc 1.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie was fun and engaging! Not for those that go to the movies to see real life - more for those who like over the top action for entertainment.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed Season 3 of Downton Abbey.  And, the streaming on Amazon was flawless!  Great picture and no issues with freezing as I've experienced in the past.
B006QSL9XC|4.0|\\"Gettysburg\\" was originally conceived as a mini-series for TNT, but Ted Turner liked it so much he made it a theatrical. The film could have benefited from some editing, but does a good job of covering some events during the three-day Battle of Gettysburg.  The leading roles are filled by Martin Sheen, excellent as Robert E. Lee; Tom Berenger as James Longstreet, Lee's most dependable corps commander; Jeff Daniels as Lawrence Chamberlin, colonel of a Maine regiment; and Stephen Lang as George Pickett.<br /><br />Richard Jordan plays Confederate general Lew Armistead, who was fatally wounded in the battle. The scene was Jordan's last appearance on the screen. He died within a year of a brain tumor at the age of 56.<br /><br />The film shows Lee's reluctance to fight at Gettysburg at all, but once the battle starts, Lee goes all in, culminating in the doomed Pickett's Charge. Many of the scenes are very well done.  The stand of Chamberlin's 20th Maine on Little Round Top, ending in a bayonet charge that finally routed the Confederates, is one of the best battle sequences ever filmed.  When you see ranks of men blasting away at each other with .58-caliber muskets at a range of 20 or 30 yards, you cannot help but be impressed by the raw courage of the men on either side.<br /><br />The filmmakers used hundreds, if not thousands, of Civil War re-enactors as extras, and this lends a certain verisimilitude to the movie; but in closeups, it is hard not to notice the number of men who are older and, shall we say, more well-upholstered then men in either army would have been in 1863.  Other than that, the great attention given by re-enactors to their clothing and equipment is a big plus.<br /><br />TNT made several good historical movies back then (\\"Ironclads,\\" \\"Rough Riders\\") but \\"Gettysburg\\" was the only once that enjoyed wide release.  It is a fitting tribute to \\"The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here\\" at Gettysburg 150 years ago.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Enjoy the majority of her song on this album.  She is such a great singer and her voice comes out so clear.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Wish there were hints and other clues. I do not want to buy extra bubbles in order to play the game.
1423124111|5.0|Disney rescanned all of the original artwork to make this book, and you can really tell. The book is beautiful and the information inside is great. The only thing is that I wish it had more posters from American parks, as that's where I'm from.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Wonderful characters and how they intertwine with each other.  The writing changes slightly to accommodate the point of view of the character, which gives more depth of the character.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|I just the love message and the energy that ignites your senses<br />and just makes you want to clap your hands and dance around<br />if you allow yourself to get your true \\"Happy On\\".....
B005PK57IK|4.0|The third season mad some predictable turns, but managed to keep my interest alive.  There were things that I thought were a manipulative, but the episodic nature of the series suited my taste.<br /><br />I will come back for season 4 when it hits prime.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Is not compatible with my kids Nabi 2 tablet with an Android system. Lame. It should work on all of the android tablets if it works in one.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|The CD is a mixture of  many types of music from pop to Latin, French, Afro Cuban and Jazz.  I enjoyed listening to<br />it tremendously.  I shared it with some people who loved it as well.

0062238868|1.0|Where have all the real soldiers gone?  Does anyone else here remember when the US military was made of gentlemen and respected things like honor?  Where is the Smedley Butler or the Dick Winters in today's service?  Are they still there, quietly enduring, or are they all shot in the head and dumped down a hill by their own compatriots like Pat Tillman was when he threatened to speak out against a corrupt war? Anyway, for those who have lost all bearing on morality, a REAL soldier feels remorse for taking ANY life.  That's just part of being a real human being!  Only a true psychopath would say \\"I love killing\\", and only the most deluded would think they could murder over 150 of God's children and still have nothing to answer for when they face their creator.  It is a mark of the sociopathic attitudes pervading ALL of modern-day American society that we would accept this as a viable way of thinking.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Kyle's psychosis is not unique- I call this situation the \\"Oakleyization\\" of the military (so named after the ubiquitous douchebag sunglasses which have found their way onto the face of every soldier).  Chris Kyle was arrogant & self-aggrandizing, supremely bigoted, addicted to alcohol, tobacco & pornography, and itching for a fight at all times, placing \\"country\\" over family OR God..  Is this the American fighting man of today?  Apparently so.  That's what happens when you lower recruitment standards to start accepting criminals, thugs & psychopaths.  All fueled, like the rest of America, on the dumb, violent nationalistic fantasies spread by the government & their media propaganda wings (from FauxNews & CNN to Disney & Dreamworks), the tattoos-and-video-games generation are mostly just mindless thug killers.  It's not for nothing that when Kyle left the service, he started his own (occult-themed) MERCENARY COMPANY (Craft International- \\"craft\\" being another word for magick) so he could keep getting paid to kill people (except now without having to deal with pesky things like public oversight).<br /><br />Let us not forget even for one second that Operation \\"Iraqi Freedom\\" was an ILLEGAL INVASION of a foreign country which, tyrannical dictator aside, made no aggressive moves whatsoever towards *US*, which did NOT have anything to do with 9/11 (as our gov't- and Chris Kyle- falsely claimed), and which did NOT have any \\"weapons of mass destruction\\".  The \\"savages\\" who Kyle so proudly killed were people who were defending their homeland from foreign invaders & a newly installed puppet government- that what the word \\"insurgent\\" MEANS (& if you still don't get it, the kids in the movie \\"Red Dawn\\" were insurgents, & you blind patriots call THOSE characters \\"heroes\\")!  He wasn't \\"fighting for your freedom\\", he was enforcing corpocratic policy (policy adopted for reasons that have nothing to do with you).  The fact is, every war the U.S. has engaged in for the last hundred years has been corrupt and fought for reasons completely different than what is/was told to the public. All of this is now known to historic record & widely recognized by academia- Wall Street working with the Nazis, CIA drug wars in Indochina, Afghan opium trade, et cetera et cetera ad infinitum. News flash, friends: WAR IS A RACKET. If you don't believe that, you should read the treatise of the same name by Major General Smedley D. Butler, USMC (who was, FYI, a *TWO-TIME* Medal of Honor recipient and, in his lifetime, the highest-awarded American serviceman EVER, so you may not like what he says, but any patriotic pissing games you want to play about whether he's a \\"real soldier\\" or not are null and void).<br /><br />Anyway, all the reviews calling this man a \\"hero\\" are literally insane.  If you call yourself a \\"Christian\\", but laud a man who repeatedly stated \\"I LOVE KILLING\\" as a HERO, that is so insanely hypocritical and logically impaired there are no words to describe it.  And the absolute bloodthirstiness embodied in so many of those comments would be completely out of place but for the fact that they come from adherents to a religion that tells believers to drink the blood of their savior.  Which certainly explains how they could be morally twisted enough to see flagrantly obvious Satanists like Chris Kyle or George W Bush and actually believe they are \\"good Christians\\" (whatever that means- if that's the measure of a \\"good Christian\\", then it's a contradiction in terms).<br /><br />I'm truly saddened that humans, Americans, and self-proclaimed \\"Christians\\" would so willingly throw in behind such sociopathic beliefs & attitudes. I use that word for a reason, because we are dealing with an actual pathology. Read Lt.Col. Dave Grossman's book \\"On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society\\". It's about exactly what the title says- the psychological cost of learning to kill. In short- by dehumanizing the \\"enemy\\" and giving over to the programming, one is in danger of becoming a murderous robot. It is Extremely important for soldiers to make every attempt to preserve their humanity in the face of such extreme circumstances. You may be ordered to kill, but you don't have to LIKE it. Chris Kyle openly and repeatedly said \\"I love killing\\"- that is the very epitome of a psychopathic/sociopathic mindset. The fact that it is so openly accepted by the masses in America (both military & civilian) is simply evidence of how degraded our ENTIRE SOCIETY is today. This general attitude & mindset are the result of the programming described in one of Grossman's later books, \\"Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill : A Call to Action Against TV, Movie and Video Game Violence\\", all about how the military-industrial-entertainment complex is fostering violent & sociopathic attitudes among children in order to increase the yield & quality of future recruitment efforts. Well, this \\"Oakleyization\\" I talk about is just the first waves of that programming now bearing fruit. If you actually LIKE this thuggish, dumbed-down version of the US military, then congratulations- you're going to see more and more of it.<br /><br />--- REVIEW EDITED TO INCLUDE GROSSMAN & BUTLER REFERENCES ---<br /><br />You can dismiss me, but you can't dismiss the experts.<br /><br />NOTE:  For more on the dumbing down of American youth & society in general, see \\"The Deliberate Dumbing down of America\\" by Charlotte Thompson Iserbyt (former Senior Policy Advisor in the U.S. Department of Education).  Just Google the title for a free PDF copy.  And for God's sake, WAKE UP and start thinking for yourself.  Question everything you are told, and refuse to be resigned/assigned to these overly limited prefabricated beliefs & identities, be they political, socioethnic, religious or otherwise.  The world is far more complicated than any of them are telling you, and you have far more potential than any of them will ever let you recognize.  Right now America is a land of digitized zombies living out a parody of a civilization.  Turn off your TV, turn off your cellphone, turn off your computer- besides the \\"programming\\" itself, electromagnetic pollution is very real, & very detrimental to your health.  It causes, among other things, symptoms of ADHD, stress, anger, frustration, dissociation, and it is helping to keep you hypnotized while the gangster elite are looting this country and conning you into fighting wars to enrich them.  Reject the psychological programming that is being imposed on you from all sides and THINK FOR YOURSELF.  You have to go out of your way to educate yourself, though, because neither media nor schools nor church nor government will ever tell you the full truth about Anything.  That's YOUR job.  God gave you a brain, so USE IT.  And for the love of all that is good and holy, stop making heroes out of people who repeatedly say \\"I love to kill\\".  It's indefensible, on any level- moral, logical, spiritual, you name it.  But evidently that's just how degraded our morality, logic and spirituality ARE these days...
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Here is one of Moyes' best.  Joy, happiness, trauma, heartbreak - its all in here.  You flow along with the characters, laughing and crying.  A really poignant and sensitive touch to such a controversial topic.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|True to form...the plots kept in line with series, books, and movies. It was great to see how Hannibal perfects his craft.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Another fine delivery by Connelly with Harry Bosch continuing to intrigue, amuse, delight.  A great main character with a good plot.  Always a pleasure.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Well, let me start by saying I love Sylvia Day's writing and this novel is no exception, but correct me if I'm wrong but a trilogy means three right??? I loved this book just like the previous ones the story and the writing above all is exceptional but I was ready for THE END! If you can get passed that then this book is a must.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|There is no doubt that Hosseini is a skilled story teller.  However, I think this novel ran off into several directions that were barely necessary and jumped around a bit detracting from the flow of the story.  Perhaps after all this is how Hosseini's home country is with the war and all its futility. That is not to say that it wasn't enjoyable but I think a second read further down the track might be worthwhile.
B005723JSQ|5.0|An excellent storyline, great character development. Loved this story!! :')<br />Certainly not like any I've read before. Word limits -,-
B00CLZ4B4I|3.0|Movie was ok, it had a very simple story and did not build deep memorable charecters like you would expect. The story does little to expand the wonder of oz.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it!!!! Man I want to give it 200 stars! As soon I got on I was amazed!<br />Oh and by the way I am making a golden castle so can any<br />Body join?
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is so fun I play all the time and my sister always wants too play the game!!!!!! Get this game!!!!!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have not been much of a reader since a teen, years later my daughter got me interested in a reading again while recovering from surgery. I read 50 Shades. Then she sent this one to me, I could not wait until I got ahold of the next one Walking disaster. Very interesting not to much smut but it keeps you on the edge. Keep up the good work and kick out some more.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|An absolutely amazing book for anyone married or single! Received it as a gift and I am so grateful and hav already recommended to all my friends that its worth purchasing!
B0019LZV4E|4.0|Helena is born for such characters! Weird, gothic, yet lovely...<br />Am I too much a Harry Potter fan, or this movie just uses too many HP cast? Bellatrix, Snape, Wormtail...<br />Good acting, classic plot, but I'm not a big fan of all the singing
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Sometimes it's hard to see the bigger picture.  When life isn't fair, when times are tough, when things aren't going our way and we can't seem to make sense of what is happening, our focus tends to be on what is happening NOW; WHY, etc.  Hope causes us to  focus on something (or someone) other than ourselves and then it spills over into the lives of others and that's when anything is possible.  I've heard it said that redemption takes a moment, reclamation of character takes a lifetime.  Our journey in life builds our character.  This movie is about a journey(s).  It is interesting, thought provoking, and well put together.  Great acting.
B0030B621W|4.0|Very touching sci-fi overall.<br />One star deducted because the ending is a little hasty, and the beginning is a bit too slow.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|We have really enjoyed playing this game with random people and friends that live far away.  It is quite enjoyable and can spark some creativity.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Very Quentin, whimsical and funny, very breath-taking.<br />Plus the old hunter is soooo cute...<br />Good plot, good acting.<br />Must-see for a Quentin fan or non-Quentin fan
B00C81AVNU|5.0|I had to get this CD before I saw the show, and I fell in love in each and every song on here. It is a fun, uplifting musical that can't help but put a smile on anyone's face who gives it a listen. I would highly recommend the soundtrack to anyone who enjoys an upbeat fantastic soundtrack. The musical is a must-have!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This will keep you awake at night for more reasons than one.<br />Flynn is a very twisted, supremely talented spinner of yarns that plumb the depths of human depravity and pathology.<br />And I mean that in a GOOD way!!<br /><br />I will read anything this woman writes.
B008XBASVY|3.0|I expected more, sadly.  This reads like (but not surprisingly like) a rather long Glee episode.<br /><br />The ending was somewhat redeeming... until the epilogue.  I really wanted to like it, but I didn't particularly care for it much.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Interesting presentation of the Lincoln story.  I didn't realized that it focused on the Emancipation Proclamation. The story telling of the back room dealing to get legislation passed reminded me of the Obamacare sausage making.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I cannot get enough of this series.  Come on book six and seven...<br /><br />This book is the other half of A Feast For Crows (book 4) with the other characters' views.  Some scenes are even duplicated from the other perspective.  A total joy to read.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|This movie reminded me of Forest Gump  or Love in the Time of Cholera -- movies that spanned multiple decades.  The movie gets the &#34;feel&#34; of the different eras right.  Brad Pitt's physical changes throughout the movie are also a wonder of special effects.  I wasn't bothered by the overall theme -- that love doesn't last -- like some reviewers were.
0800141849|5.0|Perfect love story.  Irresistible to watch as Jeff Daniels fights the love connection, and Barbra Streisand does everything to win it.  The ending is the perfect ending of all time for any romantic.
B0092SQ5EG|3.0|Peek behind the curtain of the life of one of the most successful women in music. I've fallen for Katy.
B00005UPNK|5.0|This is a phantom movie.  I watched it many times on Netflix.  Now it's no longer available.  Purchased it for dvd, and was unable to play it as it is marked for Area 2.  Had to return it, unplayable.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|it was enjoyable, but too many crazy chase scenes with continuous improbable rockface, scaffolding, bridge collapses etc. Storyline, Tolkien mythos is lost in the frantic action.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's a little repetitive, but the picture looks good on my Kindle. Prefer some of the hidden object games with other puzzles from big fish.
B0024HH32A|5.0|The last time we owned a copy, it was in VHS.  We were so happy to find it in blu-ray.  We expect to enjoy for many years to come.  It is a wonderful comedy.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|I love this song.  It makes me want to dance wherever I am when I hear it.  Everything Pharrell works on is good.
B007BVMVDU|1.0|I wasn't expecting the abuse of women and children to be there or be so graphic.  No thanks.  The story would be just as interesting without all that.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book had too many characters and details for each which fragmented the story in my mind. Didn't enjoy it as much as the first book.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Kevin Spacey makes the show.  It watches like a good book and brings out how the Washington DC political machine works.  Watch it !!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is classy, funny and very well acted and written. You have to start from the beginning so you can keep up with all the charactors in this fast moving drama. One of the best series that I have ever taken the time to watch. I will never miss a episode.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Full of surprises and great story telling, I read this book without having yet seen the TV show. Now I'm hooked! I'm ready for the next book and the show as well. Highly recommended!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This movie is a perfect family film. My 3 year old loved it and wants to watch it all the time now! Sure to be a classic.
1423141997|4.0|This was an excellent addition to this series.  There are five books planned for this series.  The fourth book, The House of Hades, is scheduled for an October 2013 release date.  This book takes us to the sister camp for Camp Half Blood, Camp Jupiter.<br /><br />I listened to this on audiobook and the audiobook was well done.  The narrator does do some kind of over-the-top and silly voices for some of the characters and some of these were a bit annoying.  The main characters however have well done voices and the narrator conveys emotion well.  So all in all this was a good listen.<br /><br />The book starts with Percy battling for his life and struggling to get to Camp Jupiter.  Percy has lost his memory and really has no idea what is going on.  In Camp Jupiter he meets Hazel and Frank.  Both of them have complicated pasts and are outcasts at Camp Jupiter.  The three of them are given a desperate quest; free the Thanotos (Death) by the Feast of Fortuna or Gaia's armies will begin their takeover of the world.<br /><br />As with the first book, this book is very formulaic.  A group of three kids (including Percy this time), must go on a quest facing more and more difficult monsters in order to free Thanatos (Death) and thwart Gaia in her evil plan to take over the world.  Like usually they are on a time crunch and only have a very short amount of time to do what needs to be done.  If this sounds familiar it is, it is pretty much what happens in every single Rick Riordan book I have ever read.  Still it is very well done and entertaining.<br /><br />The characters are all well done and engaging.  Again we have a memoryless Percy, Frank (who has powerful and mysterious origins), and Hazel (who is a cursed daughter of Pluto).  They all have major issues, but are easy to relate to and like.  Percy of course is struggling with memory lost the whole time, he is also learning more about the Roman version of his dad, Neptune.<br /><br />Frank still needs to discover who his Godly parent is.  In addition to that he is kind of a goof and a klutz who needs to gain some confidence and find out how he can contribute to things.  Frank also finds out he has some seriously awesome powers at his beck and call.<br /><br />Hazel should be dead and has a very mysterious backstory, she originally lived in another time and ended up here through a series of strange coincidences.  She is a solid heroine with some serious guilt and baggage.<br /><br />Another absolutely hilarious and wonderful addition to the story was the Harpy, Ella, who is just crazy and had me laughing my butt off a number of times.<br /><br />I love the mythology throughout and in this book we hear a lot more about Roman mythology versus Greek.  It was interesting to learn about the differences between the Greek Gods and their Roman versions; I didn't realize how differently some of the similar gods are portrayed in the two different mythology sets.  There are many wonderful new monsters introduced in this book.  We also get to meet the Amazons and some crazy wheat loving minions.<br /><br />As I said the books are predictable and they all follow the same formula.  There is a lot of humor in here (some of it a bit campy) but the stories are engaging and fun.  The book will have you laughing out loud for sure.  There are excellent action scenes, lots of interesting mythology, and some great characters as well.<br /><br />Overall this was a fun read and a great addition to the series.  The plot is formulaic, but there are a number of new and interesting characters introduced...as well as some excellent new monsters.  There is a ton of humor in here and some excellent action scenes.  I really enjoyed the contrast between the Greek and Roman mythology and getting to learn more about the differences between the two.  If you are a fan of Riordan books you will be pleased with this one.  I found it entertaining and easy and fun to read.Godly parent is.

B00992CF6W|5.0|so much awesomeness. minecraft pocket edition is the best besides pc but w/ update the multiplayer should work without blocklauncher
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Nesbo at his best. Twists and turns galore. Have fun. Can't wait for the next addition. Hong Kong? North Africa?
B003L77GGK|5.0|thanks for shipping so quickly, it is for my son in laws birthday, I thought I would have to give him a late gift but it arrived super quick.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun to play.  I like the hidden objects that you use to finish the puzzle.  I would recommend it to those of you that like a hidden object puzzle along with some logical thinking.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2 year old loves this and can do it all by herself. She asks for it all the time.
B0086700CM|4.0|Very easy to learn and addicting, although it does lock up my kindle quite often. Kids love it and it keeps them busy
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Takes so long to load,  doesn't realy work on kindle fire and it is so slow. I HATE IT it is a game not worth wasting memory on your device.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Half way done and I love this book so far.  It is the updated version of the Gail Evans, &#34;Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman&#34;... my personal bible for women in management.  Definitely recommend.  Great writing and good personal sharing!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Works grate on kindle fire and is an awesome game. any one can play it even a 2 nd grader that is how wash it is ;)
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|ABR has kept up with expectations. This album includes the same heavy riffs, breakdowns and time signature craziness as their previous work. The clean, progressive parts are integrated into the songs in a more fluid way than I felt they were on Leveler. Also, in keeping with Leveler, the lyrics are more positive and less angry than some of the other work if that matters to you. Definitely worth the purchase. It's been my driving soundtrack since the release.
0553801473|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The style is the same as the rest of the A Song of Ice and Fire series. If you like the rest of the series and George R.R. Martin's extremely detailed style of writing, you will like this one as well.<br /><br />The only reason that I am giving it four stars and not five is because of the amount of cliffhangers that are left at the end of the book. This is only worsened by the very long time it takes for Martin to complete a new book. If the next book in the series would be out sooner, I am sure many more fans would be happier with this book.<br /><br />Other than that, a very good read.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|it was an impressive cast.  but the story rambled a bit,  and that language spoken toward the end of the movie was hard to understand.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Marvel comics led me to Conan as a kid. Conan led me to Frank Frazetta and Frazetta led me to John Carter of Mars. Just one link in a long chain of fandom for fantasy, sci-fi, pulp fiction, etc. I was very excited when this film was released and was not disappointed when I saw it in theatres (yes, I was one of the few who did!). It is a solid space-opera with scope and depth, great action and well-timed humor. Normally I am not a fan of films bloated with CGI, but (save for one chase sequence) I did not find it intrusive in this film. For the most part, the acting is strong and Lynn Collins as Deja Thoris is one of the few believably competent female leads in action films. Though it does stumble in a few places, the film is satisfying and well-developed, leaving the viewer excited for future installments. We may never get them (for a myriad of reasons), but that does not take away from this film's achievement. Think I'll go watch it again! Ak Ohum Oktay Weez Barsoom!
030746363X|5.0|I had the hardest time getting rid of 25 extra pounds but this book kept it simple. No sugar, no white carbs and one cheat day a week. I lost 30 pounds and it stayed off! It has been a year and I feel great!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Ordered it for my daughter's summer reading program. She's not a fan of it at all but its a school requirement.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the fact that you can save different locations. I also like the radar section. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it had been storming like crazy for about 30 minutes and my location only said cloudy. Other than that time, it is usually correct or very close.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is challenging, but so fun you must have! one you play you cant put it down. I cant stop playing it!!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Whodda thunk that the Brits form the turn of the century could be so .. so... sad and funny and scandalous and pompous. Very entertaining.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Warm Bodies is a fresh take on the zombie craze by reaching back to the classics and overlaying a Romeo & Juliet theme to it.  The script is funny and has a good combination of scares and laughs.  Fans of Shaun of the Dead will enjoy this film despite it being a bit of a chick flick.  Great supporting performance by Rob Corddry (regular on the Daily Show).
B00000J2PH|5.0|Wonderful.What great memories this brought back.What an incredible talent.It takes me back to my younger days.I useed to know all the lyrics.

B00CO6QGCE|4.0|I've been wanting to have a way to dj for a long time. Not that anyone cares. But it's a good app and deserves the rating. I just shouldn't have to spend all that money.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Poorly written.  Contrived, predictable and insipid.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone above the age of 12.  Really.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very enjoyable, can't wait for the next season!<br />I was so caught up in the story that I did not realize how late it was getting.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Great actors, hard to follow story line with the feeling that a lot had been left out. We seemed to jump from here to there with nothing in between.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|The writers were clearly pressed to wrap things up but worth the watch. Take the time to enjoy this guilty pleasure after you watch the first 5 seasons.
B00C4YZ12C|2.0|I thought this game was incredible! My son did too, until we tried playing where we had no Internet connection. Imagine our surprise when it shut down after a minute and said INTERNET REQUIRED. I thought it was a mistake so I tried it at home with my phone in Flight Mode... the same thing happened.<br /><br />This game doesnt list that it needs Internet connectivity yet somehow it still tries to connect, and requires it to even start! You get two stars only because it was such a great game otherwise. And also for making me realize that some developers are being extra sneaky...
B001KX50BK|5.0|I'd been looking for this title for a while at a reasonable price. Glad I found it. Love love this movie!!
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|It's a fun movie about her and she does have great songs. I don't follow celebraties much, didn't know she ended up getting divorced.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was very good. I like how all the scenes are different and it still  holds your attention. I would recommend it highly.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very good game. Makes you think about things from a different perspective and makes you think hard! Love each level and the challenges.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I think Bruce Willis should let it go. it is to extreme now. at least die hard 1 was believable. the movie and stunt scenes appeared to be computer generated.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was so fun I did all in one setting. Really need more. My seven year old enjoyed it also.I think it is mind improving!
076790382X|3.0|I really like Bryson's writing.  He is definitely clever, engaging, and humorous.  But this collection of essays/articles is dated, and that detracts from the enjoyability.  There are a few jewels (being generous) inside, so take it as a time filler.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael is one of my favorite singers.  He reminds me of Old Blue Eyes.....the voice, the humor, the fact that I can understand the words to the songs he sings........etc.  I have all of his albums and have seen him in person twice.  I hope he will be as good a father as he is a singer.  Would recommend his album highly.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|It still old movie, I am still loving that movie. I love told on you had a bad Ma he through on the water.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Support could be more responsive.<br />The game is challenging as far as learning how to manage your power ups and keys. Spent lots of hours playing it.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|We are given the time we need,that is what I got from this book. It was done beautifully with a story of a rich old man and a young girl. For just brings it all together
B004CFBMRY|5.0|A great read book you cannot put down, a must for anyone who loves to run. A must to read again.
B0065CCM76|5.0|An album with all of Seger's top hits for a price you can't turn down of course any self respecting fan would buy
0425263916|4.0|I haven't started this book yet, however I have read the first one it was really good. Got it for a better price on Amazon then buying it from the actual store. Got here quickly just haven't had time to start it yet.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|At 45, I haven't listened to my Cinderella CDs in years.  I went on my yearly hunt to find something to listen to over the summer and was supremely disappointed in one of my go-to favorite bands.  I actually felt compelled to leave a review and am glad that I did....because THIS came up!<br /><br />Tom Keifer was always a solid vocalist with his own distinct voice and Cinderella's work has always been a favorite because of this.  His range is almost as good as it was with a slight gravel tone that leaves an edge without being grating.  The music is alternately hard, bluesy, and sentimental.  Some songs are classic Tom Keifer that will appeal to classic/80's hard rock enthusiasts (Mood Elevator), a bluesy hard edge (Welcome to My Mind) and a couple that have a modern feel (Flower Song).<br /><br />The album is generally upbeat and the music so good that you can't help but stopping everything else to listen and moving and humming along.  There is not one bad song out of fourteen.<br /><br />I think I'm putting this is the car and driving up to the lake with a lead foot and listen to it a couple more times.  I haven't enjoyed a release this much for years.<br /><br />WELCOME BACK TOM!!!!!
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Worth the wait. Possibly their greatest accomplishment to date, and they know it. There's an infectious swagger about this album that's hard to escape.
B00BMCLCG6|1.0|I miss the days when Jon and Richie Sambora did thier own writing.  I am less than impressed with Billy Falcon's.<br /><br />The singing on this release was less than spectacular and Jon's voice seemed flat.  I'm not sure that whether the poor range had to do with the writing or Jon himself.  There was very little of Sambo's fabulous guitar work.<br /><br />After the 4th song, everything became very monotonal.  I usually give a full release 3 or 4 plays to really judge it properly, especially from a long time favorite like Bon Jovi, but there was not one song on there to make me stop and really listen to the lyrics or the guitar work.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Let me state that I have been patiently awaiting this new album for quite some time. I started listening to Sabbath right around the time I turned 15. Once I had tired their entire catalog, all I wanted was one last Ozzy fronted album, and boy did I get it. Ozzy Osbourne sounds better than he has in years, his voice may not reach that high pitch(think &#34;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath&#34;) any more, but his croons and cackles and melodies work extremely well. Tony Iommi scorches the axe on every track, especially &#34;Damaged Soul&#34;. Geezer Butler's bass is just perfect, weaving the songs together, and giving a nice bump to each track. The madness is back, and I don't think it could've been any better.<br /><br />All the tracks have that early sabbath sound to them, and each song feels like a classic in it's own right. This is a cd that cannot be missed and deserves it's spot in every Black Sabbath and hard rock fans' collection.
B000FC11A6|4.0|The language is superb. Descriptions explode off the page in every dimension/direction. The science is less successfully articulated; however the general implications of the historically real development of computers, codes, and the virtual reality of internet dependent society get inside your head and blow your imagination wide open.
0671449028|5.0|I always look forward to reading these books, even if we read them every night for weeks. This author is amazing, check out her other books for sure.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Cant wait for the next season to start. Season was way too short, cant get enough. Just wish favorite characters were not written out.
006178480X|5.0|I tried to make this book last as many days as possible because I didn't want it to end.  I literally couldn't put it down.  When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it, wondering what was going to happen next.<br /><br />I confess, I didn't understand \\"all\\" the quantum physics and string theories, etc., but I was able to get a better understanding by using my e-reader on certain words and phrases and looking them up on the spot.  This was quite helpful, although I would probably need a full course, and more, to feel I had a true grasp of the theories.  However, the book is very informative and easy to understand, in the sense that you know the world is ending in four days unless Sigma Force can stop it.  Let me stress that the book was not so overwhelming with science that you would want to put it down.<br /><br />Every main character had emotional depth and the other characters were also full and believable.  The story line was current and interesting and the story was told with such panache and style that, as I said before, I didn't want the book to end because I didn't want to have to move on to the next novel that may not be as well written.<br /><br />(Slight spoiler alert) If you're a regular Sigma Force reader, I will say that some issues were resolved that had been left open in previous installments. Whether you like the resolutions will be limited to how affected you are by - and invested in - each character.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who loves non-stop action, a great story, great in-depth characters, history, travel, and adventure. You will get your money's worth with the length of the book; I hate paying a big price for a full novel and it's really a single or short story.  Again, I loved the book!
B007SGM084|5.0|This had made my summer! The love that you can feel between the two is awesome. It's sensual and sexy.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Great movie. Loved sharing it with our 6 year old granddaughter. Even my husband found the movie entertaining. Highly recommended.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|Benson's tribute to Nat King Cole was a treat for me. I really enjoyed his take on the classic Nat King Cole songs.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book really makes you appreciate life and friendship/family. I cried a lot; I laughed a lot.  A truly great book from John Green. You will enjoy this regardless of your literary tastes.
B00009YOQW|4.0|I bought this for my 10 mo. He likes banging on the drum, and it doesn't annoy me :)<br />I don't give him the drumstick to play with - he is at the stage where he likes putting everything in his mouth - so he gets to play with that only when I am supervising him.<br /><br />But, a fun and well made toy!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|it takes forever to load I waited ten mins and it still was still loading. and u cant get off until fully loaded
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|With great actors, a great script, beautiful scenery, you cannot go wrong with this wonderful series that I do recommend.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am so caught up in the drama that l dream about the Crowleys. Wonderful  and educational, not to mention gorgeous !!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Probably one of the most original Science Fiction books Ive ever read. The character development makes all characters leap out of the page and your emotional attachment to both hero and villain is excellent and then it challenges your expectation on who are the heroes and villains.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|An exciting wonderful read all the threads of the pattern repaired have loved every book in this series and I think Brandon has done the series, characters and Robert proud
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|I loved this movie growing up. Now my daughter enjoys watching it. Her dad, not so much! Maybe its just a girl thing, who knows. Anyways, I def. recommend:)
B0081336FO|5.0|Brilliant, Cleaver, witty & FUN!!<br /><br />LOTs of great story line & detail to (Re) Create this masterpiece, Fun STuff.  Must See
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it. It is amazing. I think they should have levels up to 200 because on the iPod they have it up to 100 and you need to make it more awesome than the ipod
B002N9MK8G|5.0|there are no stars for this cd. It's fabulous!! Wonderful!!!!!! Out of this world!!!! Sinatra is the ONE! Superb and great
B00DGN51O8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, good graphics, good humor, not quite a 5, but fun stuff!  My review is done, I resent the fact that Amazon wants me to write 5 more words to finish...if I want to write a one word review I should be able to
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It is very addictive. I could sit for hours playing it. The only problem is when advancing to the next level, it sometimes goes to the page to buy more bubbles and it is difficult to get out of that page. Otherwise, I enjoy the game.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I love these types of games, but there were only 9 levels, I do hope they add more levels soon, because I really was starting to enjoy the game.
B000085RPU|2.0|When I tried to play it I received an error that stated &#34;Can't play this disk please, check region code.&#34; I should have known not to purchase a DVD outisde of the United States! I waited for two weeks for nothing because to mail it back is outrageously expensive!
B005HSL626|5.0|Lots of fun, decent amount of play for the free version. This is one of the classics of mobile gaming for a reason.
B00C8RDSWK|5.0|This was just the cutest movie-I especially liked the part where he read them the story of the three little kittens-and used his fingers. Too cute!
B00BESM14U|5.0|I like this movie.  It was funny and sweet and had a good message.  I would buy this movie.  Really good movie
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Not just for teenagers! Impeccably well-written!<br />Could not put it down once I started. Definite page turner that will have you sucked into the futuristic Panem in minutes...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|One of the few must have apps any device should have is a calculator. This app is wonderful for the basic calculations I wind up needing to do &amp; find I generally don't need another.<br /><br />If you need something more, then I suggest you keep looking, but as a basic calculator app, this is top-notch.
B009439E7O|4.0|not like most of there other cds but is good.think i like there older stuff a little better just sounds different than there other cds.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun trying to find the hidden clues only game is to short. They do promise to add more floors. can't wait
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|A fun time based strategy that has micro pay but is not essential to play as long as you have a little patience
B00785P2QC|4.0|A big fan of this game.<br />Me and my wife are addicted. The game play is nice and no lag or bugs to work out. I also like that you do not have to spend real money to make it through the game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read each Crossfire Novel in less than 2 days! I couldn't put them down!! I can't wait for the rest of the story!!
B008OOYALE|4.0|This is a fun game but it can be an expensive game.  It wants you to buy gold often.<br /><br />This game is lots of fun to play.  The only problem is that it wants you buy &quot;gold&quot; often.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love it can't wait for more levels to open. when will they open? I hope it will be soon.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I wish I didn't buy this stupid thing. its boring and the. controls are annoying no matter how you look at it.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|For a fairytale adapted story, I thought it was very well done. I guess I need eight more words, so I'll just say that for a PG movie it was pretty good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is much better than subway surfer 100% more better than subway surfer I was waiting for this game long time
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This works very with my ipod nano 6th gen.......very easy to connect to bluetooth head set.  I would recomment this product.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this game.  My husband even likes to play it.  Can't wait for added levels and updates. Thank you.
B00BGZ8TVA|4.0|Very unusual story line. I knew very little about it when I bought it, had heard it was good.  Movie opinions are so subjective, what one person thinks as good, may not be the same for another. In this case, however, the assessment that it was good, was true.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Thank you - almost brand new!  The story was wonderful and what you sold was not damaged.  We will look to you in the future to purchase from you.
B00B5HQL50|3.0|I was expecting a lot more special effects....as it turns out...it was much more like the James Bond when Sean Connery played the main character.  The action was o.k., nothing spectacular, however.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am very glad this wasn\\"t the end!!! There is so much drama...will it ever just be easy for them?
B0053R3J7G|5.0|This is a great set for lego fans, three different houses in one should keep lego fans busy for quite a while. The product was reasonably priced for a limited edition set that is no longer available from Lego and was in good condition.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I give it four stars  cuz it is fun and a cool game but..... it does run a little slow
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie and franchise overall. Makes me want to get a good understanding of all the interwoven movies and keeps me excited for future releases. Entertaining, action packed just plain cool.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you think you have problems, watch Downton Abby to really find out what problems are!  LOL.  Good entertainment with great sets, costumes and cast.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is great mindless reading.  As usual, the book had a happy ending, although getting there was not the scenario I expected.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I use CalenGoo on my Kindle Fire HD to sync with my Google calendar and tasks. This app works wonderfully. I haven't had any trouble using it. I've found it actually enhances the function of my calendaring and task management over the basic Google offering.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book had me drawn in from the very first few pages!  It was a page turner for me, I hated to finish it.  Made me cry
0812993845|2.0|I will preface this by saying that I get super annoyed with people who review books that they have not read (but it arrived really fast... um, what?  you're reviewing the shipping process and not the book).  That being said, I did not finish this book.  I know, I know... hypocrite.  I got 60 pages into it and couldn't continue.  It was really annoying, confusing and well, stupid.  I should note that I am HUGE Sophie Kinsella fan and find most of her books charming but this one was pretty painful.  I also would like to address the critics that say she is not a good writer.  Sure, she is not Hemmingway but in her genre, I think she is brilliant.  She creates engaging novels with cute characters that move along at a snappy pace.  I would love for those people to attempt to write a novel and then say that she is a bad writer.  That being said, this book was kind of a dud from such a normally great writer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Makes me want to own my own horse...the game seems so real and so much fun. I love all of the pink gear and can't to make my horse look all girly
B00753MBHA|4.0|Accept certainly came back with a blast when they found Mark Tormillo to take over the throat duties from the long departed Udo. Blood Of The Nations was a classic in your face bludgeoning Accept classic which Stalingrad fell short of. Don't misunderstand - Stalingrad is a top line heavy hitter and gets a regular run in my player - it's just not quite up to the standard set by Blood. I guess if Blood had never been released I'd have given Stalingrad 5 stars, but the Tormillo Accept debut had set the bar just that bit higher than Stalingrad achieves.
B008EEB4TA|4.0|Marina and the diamonds is a good artist.  I like that her music is different.  I didn't know who she was before I bought this album and look her up!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This novel is gripping from beginning to end.  The characters wrap themselves around your heart. I am truly sad to have finished this book.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I somewhat enjoy this game. It is exactly the game I thought I was buying but it is a little difficult.
B000000OPZ|5.0|When I first Heard this Album back in April 1987 I was Blown away.So im listening to this Record on my Big Fn Stereo System im like Who is this Guitar Player this guy is Awesome I looked on back of the Record Album John Sykes Hmm I Never Heard of Him and soon after I put Him in the Ranks of Ed Van Halen and Randy Rhoads. John can do it all with His Black Les Paul,Fender Strat Guitars and Mesa Boogie Amps.Excellent Leads, Rhythims Sexy Vibratos with Endless Sustain. I Think Daves Voice is Perfect in this Album Very Smooth. I Can't Leave Out the Original Drummer Aynesly Dunbar Wow This Guy is Good, I Heard they Auditioned a lot of Drummers He Could Last Threw Bad Boys Song with out Keeling Over. Anyway Every Song on this Album Kicks Major Ash. There's only one other Album thats #1 to Me and its Van Halen 1 Every Song on That Album Kicks Ash Too. How many Albums can you think of that Every Song is Good. Not to Many maybe a Hand Full in the last 40 Years. S*** YOU BE LUCKY NOW DAYS IF IT HAS ONE GOOD SONG ON THAT ALBUM. So Drag Out Those Big FN Speakers and Amps that your old lady Complain about From the Closet Hook it up and play this Album. Crank it up Load and Have a Beer and Enjoy.oh oh and the Beautiful Tawny Kitaen the Ultimate Rock Vixen, Love Those Videos. Hey it Works for Me. Prost[cheers]
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Đã và đang chơi game này, mình thấy rất là hay!! Giao diện đẹp, âm thanh sống động. Rất thích hợp để giải trí :D 5 sao cho game này!<br />I love this game!!! 5 stars!!!! Thanks :D
B00992CF6W|5.0|keeps them busy and they enjoy this a lot, here alot and they always want to play this on the kindle.
B007OAAK0O|4.0|I remember seeing this ill-fated concert on TV in the '80's. I was SO happy to see it available! And it does not disappoint. Miss Ross performance is, as always, PERFECTION! But her reaction to the impending storm & torrential rains makes me idolize her even more.  It's a hoot! And the fact that this was done at a time when live TV was still quite young makes this all the more of a feat. LOVE it!
0345535421|5.0|All the elements, plot-twisty action and characters that made \\"A Game of Thrones\\" a great read structure and set the tone of this first sequel.  This grim, bloody, whimsical and sometimes surprising (but always character-consistent) series continues to wow; it has made me excited to be a reader, in a way that I haven't been in a long time.<br /><br />Worth owning, this - as is its source novel.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Full of suspense!  Takes the reader into the dark side of abusive relationships and the aftermath that comes with it.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|There is a bit of &#34;fry pan&#34; violence... literally hitting with fry pan. Might need to be explained to the very you. My wife and I just decided to explain that is hitting to our 3 year old. There is a death at the end that is left very mysterious. Probably the safest they could have portrayed it.<br /><br />With that, this is a very good movie. Adults and children will equally enjoy it. My son talks about the horse and chameleon all the time. We will watch this again.<br /><br />We really look for movies that are enjoyable, and give good character reference to our young kids. This movie does a pretty good job on the good character part, and great on the enjoyable part.
0761169431|3.0|I really wanted to like this book. My son LOVES all things Star Wars and origami. So we thought this would be a wonderful gift for him. However, besides the various lightsabers, all other projects were WAYYYYY too difficult for him. Even with adult help! I agree with many of the other reviewers in that the instructions are almost unreadable and not nearly descriptive enough. My son (and I) got very frustrated and disappointed with almost every project. This may be a good book for an experienced origamist(?), however, I HIGHLY discourage purchasing this book for anyone that's younger than a teenager if they aren't already extremely experienced at origami.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved getting to see again. Big fan. If you haven't seen yet a must watch, love Maggie Smith. Can't wait for new season
0385349947|5.0|I suggested this book for my book club, which is comprised of other mothers from my kid's day care.  I thought it would generate a good discussion, but I didn't expect to get a whole lot out of the book.  Boy, was I wrong.  I was amazed to find that almost all of the criticisms I had heard or read about were addressed by Ms Sandberg upfront in the book.  I just don't understand why so many people lined up to bash her.  Is there anyone out there who would NOT hire nannies and housekeepers if they were working 60+ hours a week and making tons of money?<br /><br />Even though I couldn't personally relate to every part of the book, I still found the whole thing very interesting.  It was surprising to read that Sheryl had a lot of insecurities and almost failed to negotiate her compensation - something we tend to assume people at the top don't struggle with.  I also think it's worth pointing out that this is not a guide on how to become a successful leader in your career - clearly Sheryl has something special that has enabled her to take advantage of opportunities and that motivated Larry Summers to volunteer to be her advisor back in college.  However, she doesn't brag or dwell on those points, and uses her situations as background to the points she's trying to make.<br /><br />I personally would like to be at the point in my career where I would be in a position decide whether I wanted to work more or less or take on additional responsibility.  However, the book gave me a few ideas on things I can work on to help me get there.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This was a great app to download for kindle fire, it is to use, a no brainer there, as will all the social apps.
B007XHWROK|1.0|Young Mr. Bieber certainly possesses energy.  He certainly possesses an ability to energize his fans.  However, this poor boy lacks basic musical talent that is necessary to sustain a lengthy and rewarding career.<br />You must all understand, that all the young children \\"dig\\" him because he is so \\"cute\\" as the little girls would say.<br />I would tell all you youngsters that if you wish to listen to \\"good\\" or as I would state it, \\"real\\" music,check out John Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" or Miles Davis' \\"Sketches in Spain\\".<br />However, if you are truly sleepless, just put this claptrap on your hi-fi and I guarantee you that you shall fall fast asleep.  Boring does that....<br />Class Dismissed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009WO7NQO|2.0|This is just a corky version of angry birds, I was not impressed, however I have people that borrow my kindle and play, it does pass the time.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I signed up just to leave this review....  it's that bad...<br /><br />I've used The Weather Channel app since my better half gifted me with a new Kindle last year.  I've always liked the uncluttered feel and ease of accessing info on the previous version.  Sure...it had a few bugs but it gave me what I needed to know....quickly.  This new update is completely unrecognizable...and ridiculously \\"busy.\\"  The essential information that used to come up immediately upon opening (like % precipitation and daily temps and forecasts) are now several clicks away into a massively confused and cluttered interface.  And what's with the \\"achievement\\" points?  Seriously? The app is now set up like a game for a 10 year old (both in function and appearance). And they are now phishing for user info (what kind of car you drive, etc.)  I'd be really interested in knowing exactly what they are trying to achieve here.<br /><br />I'll be uninstalling and using accuweather.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game with quality! good for any horse lovers! thatgame has amazing graphics and great animation to go along with it the sounds sound real as well
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Can't believe the bad reviews!!  Honestly, stop taking yourself so seriously!  It's a fun movie with incredible action and stunts.  The car/truck chase will become a classic.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved it, but way to short! She could have done a lot more! Can hardly wait for the next book!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|great for those of us who simply need simple. extra calculating when turned on side, but I've never needed that.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this latest series.  It is getting better and better each time, hope they keep this up until the show ends.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I love the design and how professional it looks, there is nothing to do but just give it 5/5. It looks wonderful and attractive in the picture when I first saw it. But in reality, I feel it looks more shiny and more wonderful :)
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a great time waster game. It's fun and you can enjoy without spending any real money. And there are very few glitches
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game isn't super difficult but it is a good time waster. Get this game; it's well worth the download.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun and addictive game. Worth playing!!!! Fun for  family. My husband and I played with our kids. We all worked together to figure out the clues. Some were very challenging.<br /><br />.
B000W91RUG|4.0|I really enjoy the show, but one dvd disk error freezes the entire show. The freeze can be skipped over and the rest of the dvds are fine. There is enough good laughs, I don't mind if I miss a couple jokes. It's not worth going through the trouble of returning, but beware dvd disk errors can happen no matter where you buy it.
B005JABU82|5.0|This is an excellent model! I actually haven't finished it yet (I still need to put together the wings and weapons), but it is amazing how much detail is in this. At just under six inches tall it doesn't necessarily stand out, but once it catches your eye you can't stop looking at it! The amount of articulation this has is incredible. If this were based on a real robot it would definitely move very similarly. I highly recommend this to anyone that is a fan of the Freedom. Kira Yamato was one lucky guy to get to pilot this incredible machine.
0321344758|4.0|Although this book is nearly 7 years old the comments, insights are still valid. Looking at websites on a daily basis, its as if most web designers still havent read it.  Certainly DIY websites are still woeful and just applying some of the ideas would make the user experience so much better.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I honestly hated this book when I first started reading it. I got into it, and oh my Lord. I can not tell you how incredible this book is. Highly HIGHLY recommend this book.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|My four year old and seven year old both loved this movie. Now we can't wait to see the sequel in theaters!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This is a great adventure movie, and funny too. Not great for really small kids, though, as the giants actually are pretty scary.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Easy to use and was great to see the shows that I missed.  Now I am catching up on other shows that I missed.  Wonderful tool.

B0064MGU98|5.0|I missed the first season of &#34;The Good Wife&#34; and this was a great way to see what I had missed.  Easy and once started I could not stop until I was finished.  Easy and wonderful to use.

B00CH26TL8|1.0|This is not what I bargained for. Every time I want to play I have to uninstall and reinstall. Fix this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As a lover of classic science fiction, I can't say enough good things about \\"Wool.\\" Hugh Howey has hit the jackpot with this series of stories (I read the combined 'Omnibus Edition') that combine real mystery and intrigue with a touch of philosophy, sociology and lots of old fashioned nuts and bolts sci-fi.<br /><br />There are no laser guns and hyper-space jumping ships here, but readers will be drawn into the story from the first paragraph and hang til the very end. I'm a notoriously slow reader, mainly because I have too many books going at once, but I powered through this one in a couple of days and I'm not even sure I stopped to eat, sleep or bathe!! It's that good!<br /><br />Trust me .. buy the book .. (Omnibus is best value and fastest way to get it all) .. and see if you aren't immediately downloading/buying the sequel \\"Shift\\" like I just did.<br /><br />Well done Mr. Howey .. well done indeed!!

B008KRJWEK|3.0|I do love the gave but to upgrade a vehicle it costs too much. You can buy coins but that is very expensive for what it is.

B0002IQMKM|5.0|Getting the best of any group is great, but the Talking Heads are awesome.  This has the best of the all, including Take Me To The River and Burning Down The House and many others.  Highly recommended!
B00319ECGK|5.0|The best of the series and awesome to see on blu ray for the first time. I am not into all the commentaries and behind the scene stuff like some movie geeks just like watching movies not hearing about them myself. This is a must have if your transferring your collection to blu ray disks for the picture and sound. Im sure like all movies it will made into a new futuristic format like 3d or hologram TV who knows but you gotta know when to say when or else Hollywood just keeps feeding us the same thing over and over and we just end up that much closer to being broke than they are.

B00DPUB56U|5.0|In a time of many various forms of what it is to be vampire, like in 'True Blood', 'Twilight' movies, and 'Vampire Diaries'.  Byzantium is a refreshing take on vampirism.  Like the movie 'Underworld: Awaking' we have a mother/daughter team that is trying find their own identity in the world.  However, in Byzantium, we get the real deal.  What we find is a movie that is portraying a real life relationship between mother and daughter who are fighting to stay alive.  To the detriment of an all male vampire league.  The strength of the movie comes from the acting abilities of Gemma Arterton and Saoirse Ronan, as the mother and daughter lead.  In the world of the 19th century and in present time they both have to deal with a male dominated world.  But in the end they find their own strength as women.  Showing that women are just as powerful as men, intellectually speaking.  However, the ending shows that there is the potential for a sequel.  Like Christopher Nolan, if there is a sequel, I hope it builds on the first film.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is great. It gives you access to weather forecast for any area, Doppler radar views, and videos to watch.
B00448VST6|5.0|one of my new favorite movies, I only wish it could have done better in theaters simply for the fact that i want a sequel
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Amazing, can't wait for the next book! Can't help falling in love with Gideon and Eva. Can't wait to see where they go next.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This helps charge my Kindle (though I still have trouble with the Kindle itself going kablooey).  It does what it's supposed to do.
0670014893|5.0|Happy to be reading a new LeCarre. Am a super fan of his style of writing and seeing how his mind works. Starts to take me back to his earlier 'classic' work.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|From the time I installed it, it would never load from the start. It would just error out and tell me to try again later.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I enjoyed every minute of this series. The personal stories of the characters were rich and the history very interesting!
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|This was a gift for my wife on our anniversary. It was just what she wanted. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was that the cover was cracked on arrival. It was not a big deal, so I didn't bother filing a claim or getting it exchanged.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|where Seasons 1 and 2 left off.  The additional characters add to the drama, but don't overtake it.  The sets are great, the actors and actresses are great, and the series is great.  You will not be disappointed.
B002RPR6DU|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies since it came out at the Drive In so many years ago.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After the first book, Bared to You, I was hesitant to read on because I was missing the story line. The final 2 books have really brought Eva and Gideon's relationship to another level. I couldn't put them both down! So excited to hear that their story isn't over yet! Looking forward to more exciting drama! :)
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|There was a lot of talk that Tom Cruise was not the right actor to play Jack Reacher. I read the book before seeing the movie and agreed - in the book, Jack is 6 feet 6 inches tall and a physical brute. Tom Cruise is not - however, I really don't know who could have been cast as Jack with the physical attributes along with acting skills. Tom pulls off the character quite well and I was definitely entertained. If you liked the book, I think you will like the movie, especially if you are a Tom Cruise fan.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|fast shipping very good condition and exactly what i ordered. this item is very well packaged. if you are a fan of mj you will love this product
B008602KQI|3.0|I say it reminded me of our government today because of what is going on right now in our life.<br /><br />The government is spying on us and has been since 2001 and its all legal &#34;right now&#34; because we changed the rules at our conveinience.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Not a terribly daring or deep execution of this classic fiction. Somehow the actors never transcend beyond their more common methods of portrayal and I often found myself thinking more about the actors' personality than the personality of the character. I could just not get into James Franco's version of OZ. He did not play a very convincing period vaudevillian magician as he simply just did not exude that type of demeanor. An unfortunate aspect as this film must hinge on him as the leading man and his personal journey and discoveries through the fantasy kingdom. As a result of his underwhelming delivery I found myself kind of bored by him at the beginning, but I started to care more about him towards the end, even though his Oz was a jerk. Much of the same befell the lovely Mila Kunis' character as well though she did at times display a fieriness that sort of jolts you back into the film. The other actors did fair for what they were given.<br />This film may delight young children as the action is frenetic, the colors are vivid, the sounds are booming, and the chills are at times genuine. But the plainly obvious reality is that this film was made as another cash grab vehicle that fits in the bombastically colorful and spectacularly lavish visual effects package that Hollywood has been content at churning out for a couple of decades now. Its really everything you'd expect from films like these nowadays. All the money is up on the screen eager to delight and assault your senses; and all this with little of the charm that is present in older films about the wonderful world of Oz. But who needs charm nowadays when you have 3D glasses! Recommend only on a lazy afternoon when you and the family have exhausted the Pixar library.<br />P.S. I was delighted to find out that Bruce Campbell was in this film and eagerly awaited to see which character he would portray and hopefully lift up this, at times, dullard film. But sadly his part is so &#34;bit&#34; that he never gets achance to chew up some scenery with his classic wink and nod wit! What a let down.
1616202416|5.0|This book was amazing! Love the writing, style, and characters. Just finished the Thing Around Your Neck which I highly recommend as well. Can't wait to check out Americanah!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|It was an eye opening reading to our daily routines. Understanding the routines we used to do when sometimes we don't even use thinking process for that routines... Can't take the book off of my eyes. And with reality stories added, makes the book as an item or other people's journey throughout their life... Really love this book and recommended to other readers.
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|I love all 10 Seasons' DVD's. The characters are hilarious! These are a &#34;must see&#34; DVD's. I highly recommend watching the collection.

B000002H48|5.0|No Nukes is a classic filled with amazing artists.  There is something for everyone and it reminds us to be politically active for our well being on this planet.  Gave it as a gift to a couple who were born in 1979, like our son was.  34 years later it is still relevant.  think about checking out the movie &#34;No Nukes&#34; as well.
B0002HYFEI|4.0|This is a well constructed building set and larger than I expected. Larger marbles would probably run the track better without jumping off like the small marbles have a tendency to do. That is an easy fix.
0061726834|2.0|Okay, I was kind of really excited to read this. It started off really good actually.. Well sort of. I honestly thought the first 150 pages were really unnecessary. Like the writer described literally everything. Which is the point of a book but it was getting a little excessive. Like she was riding a bike to a party & the author felt the need to write 3 pages about the bike ride. Like I guess the author is a descriptive writer, which is a cool writing style but it wasn't for me. I also didn't like that the male lead Alex was only like in two scenes in these 150 pages. But I did like some things about it. I really sort of enjoyed reading about how their romance grew. But the story overall wasn't very engrossing to me. But I'm not really a YA romance type of girl. I prefer an Adult or NA romance. So I guess this was my fault. Because this wasn't the first time I was disappointed by a YA romance...
B003UYUP58|4.0|This is a very thorough history of cancer. It is a scholarly book which is interesting for those who wish an in depth study. Many interesting annecdotes are included about early patients and treatments. Pioneers of cancer research are spoken about.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its fun for everyone to jump over obstacals and do some cool flips while runing away from a sircurity guard.
0374214913|5.0|Mr. Penumbra's was a fun, quick read.  I highly recommend it.  Also, check out the book cover in the dark, it glows.
B00A81NFAS|4.0|A comedy with tension building towards a final \\"dance\\" has been done a couple of times in recent years with great results. Napoleon Dynamite and Little Miss Sunshine. Small spoiler alert: the dance scene is beautifully shot and edited as it captures the performers point of view like few others I've seen. Also, within moments of finishing the dance, De Niros spontaneous advice to his son shows that he had more invested in his son than any parlay in play that evening. It's a perfect 5 minutes of film and that's all I'm going to say about it.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I thought I had read all Grisham books until I discovered this one on Amazon! It took a while to decide this book was for adults, as well as kids. Now, I have to  read all Theodore Boone books. My Kindle makes reading so easy!
B000T412OU|5.0|Love this movie. Harrison Ford rocks! Great story and well done filming. I've watched this many times and never tire of it. A classic!!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Dementia &/or alzheimer's disease is hard to live with in a family.  My husband and I have a very similar love like the one projected in this movie.  We hope to have the same ending these two people had.  Love that deep is hard to find.  I wish everyone out there could have the same.  Grab the tissues and watch this movie....and believe in the power of Love!
B0026772N8|5.0|First read this story for required reading in a college Sociology class. Although it is difficult to get into, once you're past the first 50-60 pages it's hard to put down. Great read!
B0091WRFCO|5.0|Lot's of fun and great characters.  Good lessons with lots of comedy and music.  My three year old grandson really enjoyed it.
B008602KQI|3.0|Haven't read the book so I was approaching the movie purely as a movie rather than an adaptation. Characters, although cliched, were easy to accept. The plot, for me, required a lot of suspension of credibility. That's usually OK (I'm a Resident Evil fan), but I often thought its internal logic was dispensed with too often for questionable dramatic effect. The only real problem I have with The Hunger Games is the cinematography. It relies too much on jerky or constant camera movement. Not necessary to the drama of the scenes or to the creation of perspective -- the characters/actor are just fine.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So good I read it in two days. The characters are very captivating. Collins did a great job developing this future country, customs, and characters.
B0000844I8|4.0|Always good to see what a little education gets you. In this case, solve one of the most perplexing of earth's questions and save another civilization in another world in the meantime. The dream of all nerds (myself included) is to save something worth saving...and maybe find a companion along the way. I always thought the original movie was better than the TV series.
1400049628|3.0|The Good: Max Brooks takes surviving the zombies seriously. He covers all aspects of offense and defense, short and long term in The Zombie Survival Guide. Some advice is common sense, especially to those who spend more than there fair share of time immersed in zombie books, movies and video games. But some information, like traveling by bicycle, destroying staircases when hiding upstairs and hiding out on an oil rig for the duration is nothing short of genius. The recorded attacks section of the book reads like a vague history novel, but brings a little more of a story-telling feel to the book.<br /><br />The Bad: While obviously well thought out and probably very handy in case of a real zombie attack, The Zombie Survival Guide is so very, very boring. It makes the idea of zombies dry and tasteless. While taking the zombies with complete seriousness, Brooks managed to suck every ounce of fun out of them.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Perhaps not one of the most tightly constructed or emotion-riveting action films around, but enjoyable nonetheless. Visuals are nicely done in a pseudo-retro style. While everything unfolds in a constant, near-monotonous pace, the actors are fun and we get to go places that are, of course, very unreal. Don't look for deep messages.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Usually I can figure out a movie long before the ending.  This was unpredictable and kept me guessing.  Highly recommended if you like suspense movies!
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|I rented this video with every expectation of it being great because of at least two of the actors involved.  Maggie Smith and Billy Connolly have always been favorites of mine.  The plot had potential to be really endearing and engaging but it never quite made it.<br />And, the greatest disappointment of all, Maggie Smith, at almost the very end of the movie, started dropping &#34;F-Bombs&#34;!  I was really shocked that an actress of her level felt the need to go along with a script that called for such vulgarity!  The dialogue would have been just as effective had she been allowed to express anger and outrage with out demeaning herself and her generation with that disgusting language.  I don't understand the movie industry's love affair with that kind of language, nor do I consider it to be a sign of any intelligence on the part of the writers when that is the only thing they can think of to write.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has a standard of values that doesn't include vulgar language and bathroom humour.

B000ZP6MMU|5.0|These are the absolute best work shoes I've ever owned. I work in a restaurant on my feet all day long, and I always used to go home with a sore lower back and sore arches. No more. For $31 and change, you absolutely can't go wrong. They're comfortable, nonslip, and really easy to clean. I haven't had a single problem with the nonstick pads coming off like some people have said. Maybe they got a defective shipment. The one thing I will say is that these fit at least 1 size large. I normally wear a 13 men's in every brand, but I had to order a 12 and send the 13 back because they were so big. They're light, comfortable, and cheap. Can't go wrong with a pair of these.

193700788X|1.0|*spoilers*<br />I am so disappointed with the book! It doesn't even feel like it was written by CH.  The book didnt have the same feel as the other books..and Sookie ending up with Sam!! WTH! After everything Sookie and Eric went through  and in this book Eric was a whiny beatch! And the sex scene with Sam...what the hell was that! Complete waste of time. I will just have to write my own ending for Sookie..
