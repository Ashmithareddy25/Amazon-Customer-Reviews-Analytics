B00947N6UG|5.0|Ordered this as a preorder an d received as soon as available for sale plus I received a discount from amazon for preordering ! Terrific family movie with a great message of guarding our children by chasing out the bad in the world and replacing it with a belief in the good!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I played this on fb loved it there and its good on the fire too its a long game but always new things to do I would recommend it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book really got to me with the whole love story. But most of all I like the fact that it is an action book
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|So great to hear Mr. Eric Burdon again! His voice... his phrasing and power... the man is simply KING! The reviews are right... this is a great CD and I can barely stop playing it. The artist has lost nothing since 1968 and may be better than ever! Such power -- such songs! Do yourselfs a favor and check this out. Better, just buy it. If you like the Animals, the blues and &#34;muscular rock&#34; you'll love this CD as much as I do! Rock on, Eric! And bless you!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Nice Ride! Great graphics! Fast and fun! Grab this one and have a hoot!  Got a minute or two?  This game makes time fly!
B00390BE7G|4.0|Well written and well researched.  All the information you need on animal farming.  A real eye opener to what goes on in the industry.  I would recommend the book to anyone.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie is wonderful!  The relationship between Francois Cluset and Omar Sy is just spectacular and they have great on camera chemistry.  I'll be owning this one.
0811876373|5.0|I love this book! Bakerella has amazing and fun ideas. Some seem a little hard to try at home, but I'm always inspired by her creativity and great photos. So cute! Also LOVE her blog!
031262820X|3.0|I've been on a Sophie Kinsella/Madeleine Wickham kick lately. Her books are such quick, easy reads but really draw you in and you just feel so invested in the characters she creates. This book was cute, a pretty good read, but not the author's best work. Am I glad I read it? Sure. Would I tell a friend about it? Probably not. Looking forward to to the next one I pick up by this talented author.
B00164KYV4|5.0|I adore this movie! Love how they related it to the book. Love the story, love the humor, love the cast, love it all!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are amazing such a great game I actually feel like I am with my horses and the game is so addictive you won't believe it haha
B0016MJ6HY|5.0|Such a great movie and hardly anyone knows about it! Great story and I love the music! Norah Jones is great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This review is amazing .. love it so much :) perfect on my kindle and iPad too .. download everyone
B007R6X9IK|5.0|As a longtime Depeche Mode fan, I ordered this album to see what Dave Gahan is up to when he's not doing DM. It turned out to be one of my new fave albums. It has a meloncholy to it. It reminds me a bit of Nick Cave and some of Tindersticks - it's at times stunningly beautiful. Far, far away from the industrial sound of DM. &#34;The Longest Day&#34; just blew me away - it's an amazing song.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I am trying to get faster, it is a fast game.  Fun to challenge yourself, and I do.  Moves around real nice and allows you to get at ones you may have thought were hidden.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|I so love this album!!!<br /> I think it's the best DM album since &#34;Exciter.&#34; &#34;Soothe My Soul&#34;, &#34;Slow&#34; & &#34;All That's Mine&#34; (bonus) are my fave songs.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I have the kinde fire 7&#34;.  It protects it, keeps dust off of it when it's not in use.  Nicely fits in my purse to carry with me.  Of course protecting it a the same time.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I am really enjoying &#34; Fringe &#34;. A combination of the &#34;X-Files&#34; and a favorite show from my boyhood , &#34;The Outer Limits &#34; . The more science you are familiar with the better but the actors are outstanding . As with all good series you become attached to them emotionally . When Olivia escaped from being trapped in an alternate universe both my wife and I were glad she was home again . You will be too .
B00280LYIC|5.0|Was a amazing book and one kid will win. You will love it when you read the book it will blow your mind
B00B935SUY|5.0|Sound City shares a chapter from rock history that every rock fan should know.  The variety of artists featured and interviewed was sublime.  Highly recommend.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Me encanta esta MOBA soporta hasta 32 gb de ram a 2000 mhz! tiene para hacer SLI o Crossfire y posee 6 puertos sata 3! lo he combinado con un procesador amd FX 8350 y 16 gb de ram corsair vegeance y ahora poseo una super maquina de juegos! :D
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I loved the cast but the film was long and dark in a pointless way.  I kept waiting for something truly compelling to happen but was let down.
B004U52VPS|1.0|This is fun for one play.  It is difficult to set up and the catapult is not quality.  We have another catapult toy which works far better and lets you be more creative in what you aim for.  The kids love the video game far more than this set which rarely ever leaves the closet.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love playing but have a lot of problems receiving the gems I order every time. I love horses n love playing this game but it's very disappointing to have these problems.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Classic young adult fiction.  I loved it and am happy that my 6th grade daughter is now reading it.  This is a creative story and an easy read. Enjoy!
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I loved this book-the entire series. I have a huge love of wolves and their deep seeded loyalties. This series touched very true to that.  Thank you Maggie Stiefvater!!!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|when you try to install it says error try again and they put the good reviews at the top if your reading this DO NOT BUY THIS APP!
0452289963|5.0|I must first start by saying that I'd wanted to read this book since Oprah featured it on her show, but I made other books and things a priority.  (I don't think I was ready for the life changes it would bring.)<br /><br />This book ended up changing my life.  I'm a much calmer person now, and I can face many situations in a state of neutrality.  My most favorite story (among many) in the book is about the cold soup.  Tolle recommends stating the facts in a neutral way, without adding drama or fanfare.  Just tell the waiter your soup was cold.  (You don't have to threaten to sue the restaurant, or call up and tell your girlfriends that the restaurant served cold soup, or yell at the waiter because the soup was cold.)<br /><br />That one story has carried me through a lot since reading it.  There have been many situations that could have gotten out of hand if I added unnecessary drama to it.  However, being in a state of neutrality allowed me to be in a state of grace, and the rewards are endless.  By not adding drama, I got quick solutions, and I even got monetary compensation.  Thank you Eckhart, Oprah, and even my teacher.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie is for anyone who wants to remember what it is like to feel 'infinite'. Perfect writing, casting, acting, music. I absolutely loved this film. Five stars!
B00006JSS8|5.0|I was very happy with the overall quality of the CD. The cover and book was in relatively decent order.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|no soul just effects,and mirrors, garbage humor added to satisfy the American audience read the book this movie if you closed you eyes and just listened to the sound effects could be any movie made in the last 20 years boom clash bang o my this is just a sell out
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Majority of the series was thrilling and interesting.  Sort of a cross between Fringe, and Falling Skies from the USA.
B0033PQUXA|5.0|This is such a captivating movie that you quickly get over having to read the subtitles.  It's the story of a boy who is fascinated by movies and forms a life-long friendship with the projectionist.  There are many unexpected outcomes which makes you want to keep watching to see what happens next.  Somewhere in the middle there were some cuts that I found odd and didn't understand, but as the movie comes close to the end, I completely understood.  The last scene is just incredibly touching.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much. It was full of real emotion. Great twist at the end. Quick read. Great summer book for the beach!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Believe me when I say that this app is totally worth the money.Especially the part where I can wake up to my favorite songs
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Me, my hubby and my girls love all the Angry birds games. We spend hours on end a week playing these games.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I chose this movie on recommendation from my daughter and grand daughter who had seen the movie during their flight to South Africa over Christmas. It was a very moving and interesting experience to travel through the life of a young boy's inquisitive mind as he questioned everything about life. His utter trust in God and his journey to find out about all religions fascinated me. His courage and intelligence in a time of crises when most people would have just given up, yet he found a way to tame a wild animal and to survive a sea disaster was totally captivating.<br />I would recommend this movie to all people who enjoy a challenge and are deep thinkers.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show has fascinated me since its inception and that is no small accomplishment. I am rarely intrigued enough by TV shows to sit through them even once, let alone to look foward to them and watch them as a series. Juliana Margulies is amazing and captures the balancing act that many women face in life when caught between the competing realities of home and career and children and parents and disparities/conflicts between adults, be they co-workers or life partners. Like &#34;West Wing,&#34; this show holds its own season after season. It is well written, well acted and has well developed characters that manage to surprise without becoming sordid and provides us with a recognition factor that is not limited to lawyers and suburbanites alone. I would recommend it to anyone seeking dramatic entertainment balanced with appropriate humor and a story telling ability that reveals things we often prefer not to see in our everday world balanced with good taste. I would recommend this series to anyone seeking such rewards. And thank you PRIME for making them available en toto to those of us who cannot get enough!!!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|This was a great movie for me, loved the way it was created to mirror parts of history and loved the ending where is alluded to our current President!
B008393Q2O|1.0|i just didnt like it. for me it wasn't easy to use and had to go in and out to put what i wanted
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I think the kids and I have seen this movie over 10 times, I still laugh everytime. Can't wait for part 2 to come out.
B008NMT684|4.0|he really likes this, but he wishes it had more puzzles. there are just a few, then you have to purchase more.
B00CBRH4YU|2.0|We rented this last night, paid the premium for it being offered early, wish I could have a do-over on that.  I know that Terrence Malick often makes some really different films, and I skipped watching the Tree of Life because of what some reviewers said about it, that it had really beautiful cinematography, but that there wasn't a cohesive story there, or it was just wierd.  Well that was certainly the case with 'To the Wonder', it was way wierd.  The people talk to each other very, very little in this film.  It's composed mainly of the five main characters just being filmed in different locations, walking, jumping, rolling around, but not talking.  So you see them doing different things, but you wonder why they are doing that, and there is no answer, you're just supposed to see it, and that's it.  So we watched the whole thing, and then said \\"what did we just watch\\"?  Save your money folks unless this sort of movie does it for you.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|Having the whole season laid out and I could choose which episodes I wanted to watch was very enjoyable.  I could become involved with the characters.  Much better than watching live tv.
B0064MGU98|3.0|We all still love Mrs. Margoulis from E.R.' years. Now she is a bit older, is a very good lawyer, still a beautiful woman, she is calm and reassuring. She stands 'besides' her husband despite the betrayals (Sounds like the truth about the husband will be fully discovered in the next Season/s).<br />Doesn't keep me up till 1 a.m. like other TV Series but this is definitely a matter of personal taste ...and having more sleep time definitely is not a bad thing.<br />It is a good and honest series.<br />Will I suggest this to a friend? Yes, I'll only underline to do not expect &#34;The&#34; TV Series despite Ridley Scott presence here as executive producer.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I really got into the good wife via amazon prime which I wasn't able to do on live tv.  The commercial breaks really reduce the enjoyment factor.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|love the fast pace of this addicting game.  lots of boosters make for an exciting yet stress busting fun time.
1476733953|5.0|I absolutely loved this series. I'd finish one book and download the next and the next until... MORE please!<br /><br />How do I rate this item? The full FIVE stars.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|this has the potential to be the best game on the amazon market. I would love more than anything to give this app 5 stars but .... when I have an option to use real hard earned money on this app and never receive my purchase is something I cant look past. I purchased a 9.99 silver coin package as well as a 9.99 gold glu coin package and received neither of the two!! like I said this is a great app but &quot;BEWARE DO NOT MAKE ANY PURCHASES!!!&quot;.
0345803493|5.0|I have read all three books in the Fifty Shades trilogy and this one is by far my favorite.  Enjoy!
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|FREE<br />  What more do u want.The choose is yours & it cost you nothing.This is a great deal.I recommend this deal.
0345803507|5.0|I've read all three books in the Fifty Shades trilogy and this one became a little predictable.  I still loved it though!  That Christian is something else!  Whew!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Had my doubts since most books turned movie fail but since Lord of the Rings really were great transfers I went with it. No regrets on Bluray a totally satisfying experience, watched with my 7 year old daughter who loves scifi like myself. Movie had some scenes that totally blow you away with good TV and Bluray player, digital download, and DVD are just added icing on the cake. Now I'm really looking forward to the other two films...
0307943259|3.0|There is a  huge hole in the plot, which is driving me crazy.  The judge's murder makes it possible for Mal to use Rule 35 to get out of prison, and set his plan in motion. But how do he know the judge was going to be murdered -- and at just that time? There's no answer. it's just a goof by the author that nobody caught.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|Despite all the incredible graphic, I think the story line is great! For some reason, I felt I was in the &#34;mushroom world&#34; of Alice in the wonderland in some scenes.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Not what I was ordering.  Did not fit iPhone4S properly.  Did NOT pass water test, was placed/installed correctly.  Screen on phone cover was rippled and bubbly.  Asked for money back due to faulty product and got nothing.  Will complain to Amazon.
0385523394|4.0|the author makes no excuses for herself or the crime that brought her to prison.  she tells it like it is.  as an avid watcher of reality prison shows on TV, it seems like she had it pretty easy compared to maximum security and confinement, but it's an excellent reminder to NOT do anything that could land you in prison!  she certainly didn't have fun, but it was very interesting to read about how she formed a fellowship/surrogate family during her stay.<br /><br />recommended to my aunt, a professor of criminology, and she now uses this in one of her classes.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching this show from day one and have been hooked ever since. The storyline is great, although at times the action gets a bit slow, but the zombies and the zombie fighting is awesome! Definitely a must watch if you at all like zombie movies or shows.
B00AJLHU3K|3.0|She saw Richard Thompson on TV and wanted me to get this for her after that performance. I think the jury is still out. She likes his guitar playing very much as well as the bass and drummer. I think his vocals are not her cup of tea. I'll post a update after I get more feedback from her.
B0067R0APK|3.0|The animated weather maps do not work smoothly on the kindle fire. The satellite images flash off and on between each frame. Other than that, I am very pleased with this app.
B008U0FJF8|5.0|I have heard Manu with Sting and lately with Kyle Eastwood. He has a very unique sound and drumming style that is easy for me to pick up on. His style is somewhat similar to Omar Hakim but Manu seems to like the cymbals a little more and like to play in different time signatures too. It's been a while since I have heard Omar play so I may have to find some of his current material. There is no bass player on this CD and I thought that would detract but it did not. The organ has made up for that absence quite nicely. I have already purchased another Manu Katche CD and will review it after a good listen.
B003XCVQ3C|3.0|It's a great concept but it has a mind of its own. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. When it does I feel like a genius, when it doesn't i wanna MASH THE MOSHI out of it! A headache, I'd pass on it next time.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I love this movie because the concepts just make your brain swirl with these thoughts of time travel and mind travel. Some people have an issue with the ending much the same way that there are now different endings for Blade Runner. I would like to think that Chris Nolan is just willing to take that risk of letting the viewer come up with their own ending and interpretation of what went on in the movie and draw their own conclusions. It would be interesting to see if a sequel is made. I love his take on the Batman series and his other movies are very challenging to the viewer. Most notably Memento is a great take on how to present the material that had really never been done before.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is a lovely combination of challenging and relaxing. Each level makes you think and layers strategies of previous levels. The music is calming and appealing, and I'm really looking forward to another quell.
B005FDXT32|5.0|Product arrived exactly as described. Came wrapped in the plastic. No wear and tear or damage. I love this movie so I was pretty happy to add it to my collection of Blu-Rays.
B00C3V5TTQ|5.0|I will admit, I am not a huge OMD fan - I like roughly a quarter of their material. Everything from the debut record through Dazzle Ships to be exact. I prefer their melodic, minimal Kraftwerk-influenced analog sounds opposed to their more commercial pop releases thereafter. I'm much more a Depeche Mode fan, preferring the darker melodies etc.<br /><br />With that being said, when History of Modern came out with the hype of being comparable to their earliest records, I was on board. Sadly, the only track I liked was Sister Mary Says - not surprising since that song was written in the band's early days. Every other track on the album was marred either by poor lyrics or just mediocre songwriting.<br /><br />I stayed optimistic when I heard English Electric was coming. When Metroland was released, I was immediately hooked and I bought the whole record.<br /><br />All I can say is wow. They fixed EVERY error they made on History of Modern. Amazing old school synth sounds, sugary warm vocal melodies and catchy rhythms. Minus the Kraftwerk-like instrumentals, you are left with 8 tracks and 37 minutes of music. All of it gold. As much as the lyrics are about a dystopian future, I can't help but feel uplifted by this album. My favorites are of course Metroland, Night Cafe, and Stay With Me. I'm going to have this on heavy rotation for sure.<br /><br />A lot of people are saying it, and I'm saying it too - this is OMD's best record, and coming 33 years after their debut, thats incredible.<br /><br />Here is to a few more great records before they call it a day. Got to love the Peter Saville cover art that screams Factory Records.<br /><br />Must have Synthpop album of 2013.
B00BS4U8VS|5.0|I love this show! The characters that you thought would survive and stay together doesn't. I've been in shock numerous of times since I've started watching this series from season one.I am almost done with season three and can't wait to see what is in store for season four.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I can't say enough about this wonderful series.  I've been hooked since the very first episode and was glad to find them here.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed the relationship and their love connection. Was surprised with some of the sexual trusts. However I t kept me wanting to read more.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I can't say enough about this wonderful series.  I've been hooked since the very first episode and was glad to find them here.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was looking for some true specific info on afterlife and this is a. Great good easy read on just that and a little more which made it very personal. If you would like to know what a scientist believes after his experience this could give you the perfect answer.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Series is great, new Spartacus main character is not a substitute for the original fella, but still a gripping series.  Very sad to see such a great actor die so young.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|If you have an iPod speaker dock, etc., with a 30 pin connector, then you need this device. It works great, and the price is right.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|If you know someone who plays Catan you probably know that they are addicted. You either love it or hate it. Our family falls into the love it column. We play this more than any other game. t is great for creating your own house rules and the play time is not so short you can't strategize but not so long that you want to scream and end it all (like monopoly or risk). We sometimes even play two in a row.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|I loved it.<br />I didn't have any dislikes.<br />A survivalist because it seems to be a good way to survive.
B00433LYBY|5.0|has great songs. I love the songs on it. selena gomez is awesome and this cd was so much fun.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like the game. only thing I don't like is the colors change instead of the screen just refreshing or saying no more moves.
030758836X|1.0|This is one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There are no empathetic or even sympathetic characters -- no one to champion and no one to care about. The book's protagonists are the most selfish and self-serving I have come across in a long time. As I read through the book my repeated thought was \\"who cares.\\" I share many readers' enjoyment of modern fiction, this is just not a book I would recommend to anyone.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Lost Symbol is loaded with suspense, intrigue, mystery, and with a thought provoking plot that reels you in and won't let you go.  Very well done!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Creative story that provided another adventure to experience. A definite read if you are looking for something different, entertaining, or unique.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Hilarious!  Well..  I have no so many words in order to describe this.  If you know the series, you won't regret buying it
B009FZFONO|5.0|One of the best shows on television. Explosive season finale. Can't wait for season four, will definitely be back to amazon instant for it.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|I read the seven books three years ago or more.  The first four movies were very good.  The two final weren't.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this is just fine. it workds as it is supposed to so far. don't have any complaint. thank you much
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I feel so sorry for the people of North Korea. It's amazing the Kim family  can live like kings and let the people of their country suffer from hunger and terrible conditions.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Very good  I watch bones everyday  Keep up the good work.  Will purchase. Another book today and start  reading another
B0096BIENY|5.0|It is a great album.  All their best songs and several new songs all together. This is certainly well worth the money.
B00BHMF578|4.0|The story was quite interesting since I was not paying any attention to world events at the time and the acting was very good.  Cinematography could have been a little better but I assume they were trying to make the film quality reflect the standards of that time.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Awe inspiring book about a young woman's journey to find her true self. Cheryl decides to hike the Pacific Coast Trail in hopes of finding her true self after losing her mother and divorcing her husband. Told through mind flashbacks and at the moment trials and elations, Cheryl forges on to the end. Beautifully written and hard to put down. Enjoy!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great acting, great cinematography and great story line.  Also great tongue in cheek humor and clash of the changing moral values of the time.
B000ID37RM|5.0|This movie (and the wonderful book it was based on) addressed racial issues before the civil rights movement was in full swing. It also captured life in a southern town from the eyes of a very special 6-year-old tomboy.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Good movie - a little slow at times, but excellent re-visit of the issues around the civil war and the slavery issues
B004X2M9VY|5.0|A good family oriented series!  My children love it.  Full of action and drama and we love the characters Amy Pond, her boyfriend and of course, Matt Smith as Dr. Who.
B008J5T4Q4|5.0|This is probably the first time I enjoyed EVERY song on a P!NK album. When i saw they had a vinyl of this album, I had to have it. I only wish they sold a deluxe version with the rest of the songs from the album.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|My family loves this series and love these new characters.  Action packed science fiction. We love Amy Pond and her boyfriend!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I could find nothing missing in this report. With every hour of the day covered what more could you ask for?
B000VYNYN0|3.0|I use best in quotes because this is not a good a movie.  Can't really sugar coat that part.  If you want a well acted, written, plot driven horror then you should skip this movie and maybe give &#34;The Ring&#34; a try.  However, if you want fun, gore, and over the top acting then this here is your movie.<br /><br />The one shining star in this movie is Bruce Campbell playing his signature role of &#34;Ash&#34;.  Don't get me wrong here, i'm not saying Campbell is a good actor (because he's not) but for this role, in this movie, there is just something about him that ensures he steals every scene he is in, and makes you root for him to come out on top.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Decent movie but predictable in some of the parts. Good actors but more could have been done to really make it an awesome movie, maybe the ext one will be better.
1594484805|4.0|Things need to change around the workplace. This guy gives you specifics so you can point people in the right direction. I felt it was a little short and would have liked it to have more depth. Great read tho
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love the graphics. It is a nice change to the original. This is a free version and holds my interest for quite some time. Could do without the ads after each game, but the game is over. I can move on with no issues. Really fun.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderful it written story of a a girl,a village and the drive to do the right and fair things despite the hurdles put up against the. Great twist at the end of the book  and an unexpected change in Katniss and her love interest.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this version of Free Cell. It is a great app to have on hand. When all else is done and boring, this is a great one to fall back on.
B000VI12ZS|4.0|adam beach is who makes this a winner. portrays a genuine native American, u can look straight thru his eyes into his brain and his character is believable. less believable is most of the the action:good guys  are always incredible fighters and almost never get shot, bad guys drop like flies (still exciting tho)
B009G41CG2|2.0|I am so disappointed that everytime I touched a tile, the entire board moved. I thought the graphics were great but waay to small for the Kindle. Even if I could see it, the darn board always moving was a great turn-off!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You should really get it<br />That is why i rated it five stars<br />Love it i know you will to
B0071BGOJC|4.0|I enjoy historical novels and &#34;Winter if the World&#34; gives a vivid perspective of the experiences of individual characters. THey become real people for the reader.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|It's a page-turner.  One the reader sorts out the characters and mentally maps out who is responsible for what, it's a great read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We love this show. We hate having to wait until next season to watch more! Walking Dead is super awesome.
B001NLKT60|4.0|It's an excellent wrap-up of the trilogy.  I feel like the loose ends were wrapped up and that the main characters came out ahead of the possible pitfalls.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The synopsis of this book is accurate, but it is soooo much more than that.  It will DEFINITELY \\"leave you breathless, entranced, and remembering your own first love.\\"  You will laugh, cry, and fall in love with these characters.  This is a book I have recommended to all my friends, it is an amazing story of love, friendship and trying to do what's right.  It's so hard to say more without giving away any of the story, but Colleen Hoover is an amazing writer and this book is no exception!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What I don't like is that I'll have to wait for season 4 to air. Cliff hangers are not fun. Until then I'll miss the Crawley's.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|I really love this adaptation of The Tempest because of Taymor's choice to change Prospero into Prospera. It adds new dimensions and emotions to the play that were not present with a male ruler. Also, I have always been a fan of Taymor's work both on and off stage.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very edgy. It 's hard to predict what's going to happen; you just never know. That is one of the signs of good writers.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|I am so amazed when I saw my 5 year old son trying out some of the moves. Great starter for dance loving kids.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is truly deserving of all the accolades it has received. I don't have words for how well done this is. If you like to be on the edge of your seat with excitement and enjoy becoming totally involved in what you are watching, then this is for you. Wish I could give it even more stars
B0017TWUZG|4.0|My girls, ages 9 and 13, really love it and are trying to learn some of the dance moves. I would recommend this item to folks with love for dancing Hip Hop.
B007FH9GT2|2.0|I heard all three books and this was not how I saw Lisbeth. Wow. Both this version and the Swedish version (super bad dialog) had BIG troubles to me. It was effective at making me feel cold but that was about it! Its as those they are trying to make a bad film all the best portions of the book are somewhere else but not in this film.<br /><br />You feel for this girl in the books but they totally lost the ability in the movies. She was too mean to vampire-ish, too tall.  Oh well, at least good books are out there but no more films from the books for me!

B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Very good writing! I could read this over and over again.  You'll notice I only rated it 4 star... at about 80% I didn't  like the way things were turning out. But in the end, everything's perfect.
B00BF11STU|1.0|I won't speculate on the story line. Seeing that almost all of us who are watching this movie can't say what did and did not happen you kinda just have to take the story with a grain of salt and assume everything you see on screen really happened.<br /><br />My beef with how the movie was made. Absolutely BORING. EVERY trailer, EVERY tv spot that i saw advertised this movie as a action/suspence/history movie. Couldn't have been further from the truth. The movie is unnecessarily boring and long with almost no action to speak of. The raid of Bin Laden's house is confusing and again, boring. Half of the time the tv screen is dark (the directors way of saying the SEALS went in during the night and it was chaotic). There are too many jump cuts to past events. If there is that much of a need to keep telling a back story, just edit the movie in sequential order.<br /><br />Acting seemed fine and sets seem fairly accurate as do the uniforms and tactics used. I didn't like the main  female character, however, since I don't know how things really went down, I'll reserve judgement.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Don't waste your time with this movie. There is no entertainment value whatsoever. And the bottom line is movies are supposed to entertain us, not bore us to death.

B00AECGQF2|4.0|I downloaded this for my granddaughters and they like playing it. I enjoy watching them with it and it is a good wholesome game
B008J9EYFG|5.0|This is a great album, one of the rare CD's that I tend to play all the way through once I start it.  Though I\\"ve heard of Beth Orton through the years, I was never excited by her alter-indy rep, but when I heard she was coming to San Francisco this June, I purchased this CD and was immediately knocked out by the song \\"Magpie,\\" still #1 on my personal Hit Parade!  Somebody else in these reviews refers to her maturity, and I think that's it, that Beth Orton has taken her music to a level beyopnd anything she's done before on \\"Sugaring Season,\\" similar in my mind to what Gillian Welch did with \\"Harrow and Harvest\\" and Iris Dement with \\"Sing the Delta\\" (2 more great CD's!).  Sugaring Season is dark, haunting, beautiful and a whole lot of other things that words cannot possibly capture.  I love this album and can't wait to see her live.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I downloaded this for my grandchildren. They are very good at it. I tried it a couple of times but never really mastered it
B00AB7HESI|5.0|this game is fun and exiting until you beat all the levels and then the best thing is the play ground at the beggining menu should add more free leevels
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|great game.  many hours of fun.  its great to be able to play both short and long periods of time.<br />I also like that you don't have to pay for anything and you can still play.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Background stories are great!  Just enough detail to keep you attracted to the read.  The encounter is well developed and not overdone.
B003K16P3M|4.0|Action, intrigue, and of course a love story. All the fantasy basics are there. That's almost a bad thing, because at times Graceling almost starts to feel like fantasy by the numbers, a little too familiar and predictable. Still, Katsa's efforts to solve the kidnapping of an old man, leading to a rescue effort of another placed in danger, complicated by her difficulty coming to terms with her own formidable grace, does make for a satisfying reading experience. It's easy to like Katsa and her comrades, and thus easy to get caught up following what happens to them next. Unraveling the motives of the major antagonists, working through how the graces of the various characters affect their place in the larger scheme of things and finally seeing how the pieces come together gives the book added interest that makes for a satisfying fantasy journey.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun game and if your kids are asking for a horse or pony just download this game because I think it's second best. Even better, it's free.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Any and everything you really need to make a photo great. All except if you actually want to keep it.<br /><br />It seems as though with all of its great features and the amazing photo's you will probably create, this app is unstoppable, and just simply tops the chart with its intuitivenous and slate style appeal.<br /><br />All of this goes away as soon as you realize, 'It does not save!' What a bummer. Maybe when someone is able to get a hold of the dev we may get a fix.<br /><br />As for the dev, I have read much on the policy with Amazon and tge free apps, and if that is why this has been crippled, I understand.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was a wonderful story and so well written and actors portrayed their characters so well.  They seemed like friends and family.

B008HTQ28K|1.0|It is a long boring book about nothing. I like many of John Grisham's books but this one is one of the worst books I have read in a a long time. Wish I had stopped but thought it may get better but is doesnt.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I has been years since I have been captivated by television to this degree. The walking dead is absolutely brilliant television, filled with action, strong believable characters and continuous plot twists. Season three keeps this magic formula fresh with the development of &#34;the Governor&#34;, a new villain as diabolical as the zombies!
0060936223|4.0|Just Kids by Patti Smith is a rare little gem. To me, Patti Smith has always exuded a punk rock swagger, an only half-bridled aggression. I see her, and I see only the hard, sharp angles of her. And Robert Mapplethorpe: leather, whips, unapologetic sex acts with a peculiar defiant dignity to them. Both of them are creatures who seem to have been launched straight from the scene, fully-formed and antagonistic right from the start.<br /><br />But they weren't. Just Kids is a memoir by Patti Smith about her time living in New York with Robert Mapplethorpe while they were both shaking off the dull scraps of adolescence and trying to break out as artists. Strewn throughout the book are pictures of them as very young excitable artists-in-training joined at the hip.<br /><br />Smith's prose reads like a soft-focus fairy tale. The sections set in the Chelsea Hotel, especially, have an almost Dickensian quality to them; they read as a quaint story full of larger-than-life characters, most of whom have hearts firmly of gold. Reconciling this wistful retelling of her youth with the persona I associate with her was intriguing to say the least. And obviously I am not the only one who found the disconnect between Patti Smith's presence and her internal life jarring - there are places in the text where she discusses how those around her took her for a lesbian (she is straight), or a junkie (she seems not to have experimented with pot until she'd moved out of the Chelsea). Her prose is light and airy, and her memories sepia-tinged and wholesome, despite the fact that anyone who knows the history of that scene knows just how much death and self-immolation is happening just off screen. Patti Smith herself seems to have waltzed through it unscathed, and her writing dances along the edges of the darkness that her scene held*. Without the debauchery, the excess, the Chelsea Hotel in the 70s reads as an almost Victorian affair.<br /><br />The book is structured in a circle: it opens with the moment Smith hears of Mapplethorpe's death, then jumps back in time before they have met. Smith discusses her teenage pregnancy and the process of giving her child up for adoption, her failure at teacher's school, and her time on a New Jersey assembly line in a brisk and somewhat sanitized fashion; again, there seems to be in her writing a distaste for discussions of the negative, of the hard and bleak moments of her life. From there, the book jumps forward to her first meeting with Mapplethorpe, their sweet and heartfelt romance, the little poverty-stricken life they build together, and how hard they worked to evolve their relationship with each other when their life trajectories began to diverge. The book ends with a far jump into the future, back to those last few weeks of Mapplethorpe's life and ends with his inevitable death, right back where the book started.<br /><br />Given that the book is told from Smith's perspective, it is perhaps not surprising that her motives and desires are clear throughout, but over the course of the book Mapplethorpe becomes more and more opaque. A boy who seems simple when she first meets him grows into a man full of contradictions. The person whose viewpoints and life goals seemed to mirror hers so closely at first winds up yearning to be part of the social circles that Smith herself actively avoids. It became increasingly unsettling as I read the book. What does he get from her that keeps him around? How does he see her and their ever-changing relationship? Very little is explored here in the text, and Smith herself seems to take their relationship at face value, as a thing complete in itself with little context surrounding it. It just is for her, and her wholesale acceptance of it is so radically different from the way I, personally, live out my significant life-altering relationships that it was hard for me to understand at times what their relationship was exactly. But there is an authenticity to her writing that explains the halcyon haze through which she remembers that time of her life. That period, above anything else, was her period with Robert Mapplethorpe, for whom she had a love so total and accepting it is essentially blank, without specificities, and all the hardness of that time is drowned out in remembrance of him.<br /><br />Just Kids is, like most memoirs, ultimately a work that says as much or more about its author than the subject matter itself. The story there is as much in the telling as it is in the content. And it's a fascinating look into the mind of a woman who is so very different than the person I assumed her to be. It is a love letter to the late Robert Mapplethorpe, but it's a love letter to her young self, as well. I can't help but wish there had been some balance to it, some acknowledgment of the difficulties of living so poor, or of loving a man who seems to fall into and out of and into and out of love with her, or of the pain of watching her friends get consumed by drugs right in front of her, but that's not the book she wrote. It may not be a book she's able to write. I can't help but think of her as an unreliable narrator for her own life, but ultimately that's what we all are. It's hard to tell the bald truth about your own life. It might be impossible. But still, the unanswered questions nag at me. I found this book absolutely fascinating, but when it was over, it felt insubstantial. But that doesn't mean it's not worth reading.<br /><br />*Swimming Underground by Mary Woronov of Warhol's Factory crew is a bird's eye account of the dark addictions Patti Smith seems to prefer to keep just out of frame. I highly recommend it, too, and it works as a very interesting counterbalance to Just Kids.s the halcyon haze through which she remembers that time of her life.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|The narrator/author sets the bar very high, to present a story that would make a sceptic to change into a believer in God.  He seems not to live up to this promise.  The story is not boring by any means and in the end the reader, just like one of the characters listening to the story has to make a choice.  That is a nice trick, but in itself does not make it a masterpiece of inquiry into human nature.  No regrets for having spent time to read it and I do recommend it.  The chapter about the island is very different and I am not sure if I understand the metaphor, seems almost like a separate idea inserted into this book instead of giving it a life of it's own.  It may also be an echo of the jungle in Rushdie's \\"Midnight's children\\".  Some people complain about cruelty in scenes, yes it is there but it's consistent with the harsh reality faced by the character, definitely should not detract from the book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game fun for all kids and parents not just for boys but i have not had a problem yet but it is a great game
0061134007|5.0|I read the reviews on this book and they were mostly really good (great).  Some people were bothered with the time jumps, but I really loved them.  I thought it was a very intriguing way to incorporate the protagonists past experiences, which do make us as people, form our present day decisions.  I won't say more, but it is a captivating detective mystery.  Read it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is sooooooooooo good so worth downloading.  So now go get this game like right now, right now ok
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is a great show, a good cross between one of my favorites, Farscape, and another favorite, X Files.  If you like either of those shows you'll like this.  But if like me and you like both, this is a great one to catch. There are a lot of unique ideas, even though this genre is very crowded.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really fun, i have all my friends and family engagged in this game. i aleast play sub way surfers 5 times a day. i think im addicted to this game :)
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Anne Elliot made a mistake as a young woman in following advice that was contrary to her own heart and desires.  When she becomes reacquainted with her former beau after seven years, she found that her feelings toward Captain Wentworth had not changed, though her own situation had.  Her father's extravagant spending brought shame to the family, and Anne found herself without fortune or prospects, feeling unworthy of her beloved Captain Wentworth.  This is a great love story with a great ending.  I highly recommend this novel!

B007SXB498|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen, and this novel did not disappoint.  I read in a couple other reviews that this wireless version was problematic, but that was not my experience at all.
B004N6369Y|1.0|Thank heaven I just borrowed this book instead of buying it.  I haven't read a Danielle Steel book in about 3 decades and now I remember why.  Her writing is boring, childish and far too predictable.  EVERYONE is just so perfect and wonderful - oh, Please!!!  I actually read the entire book, although I WAS skimming the last 100 pages.  She just keeps repeating the same thing - over and over again until you want to scream.  Glad I have not been missing a thing by passing up her books the last 30 years or so.  And never will bother again!  It is beyond me why this woman has the level of sales she does!!
B008476HBM|5.0|I LOVE this novel.  I think that the characters are some of Austen's best, and I love the relationship between sisters Jane and Elizabeth.  This is one that I enjoy rereading over and over again.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Wonderful!  Dear sweet Jamie and his friends. Paddy so very kind and caring to good friend. Rose, with a simple, yet true wisdom. I found I wanted to sit in a cafe along with Lydia.<br /><br />At first, I thought the author was pushing the cruelty of the orphanage until I read the afterword.  Makes me ill. In the 50s I went to a French Canadian grade school and while it wasn't nearly as bad as poor Jamie's absolute horrors it was none the less torture for me to go to school daily. Thank the Lord, mother pulled me out during the second year. But enough of that!<br /><br />If an author can bring characters true to life, to where the reader really cares about them, it's a job well done!<br />Absolutely enjoyable.<br />Read it!<br />K
0307346617|5.0|Once you start reading you can't put it down.  The author gives you many different view points of the destruction the zombies have caused and each viewpoint is engaging and thrilling to read.  It is a shame the book wasn't longer!!
0525478817|5.0|At first glance I thought this book was going to be a crapy romance book and that's why it was so popular.But I finally decided to get it even though I wasn't really sure I would like it(I hate really romantic books).But I was wrong this book is truly astonishing,and amazing.I can't believe how powerful this book is it unbelevieble.I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good popular young adult book.
B005TBN04S|1.0|This was a lazy attempt of recapturing the success of Hangover 1. The plot was almost identical to the first and where they tried to out do the first movie they simply where trying too hard. Simply put - EPIC FAIL!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle is a true American Hero.  It saddens me greatly that this man did so much for his country, his countrymen and their families, and that he and his family went through all sorts of hell only to be return home to help his fellow soldiers and be taken out while trying to do so much good.<br />So much respect is owed to the US Navy Seals.  They are men above men.  Thank you Chris Kyle and your family for your story and for your service.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The book was a page turner. It kept me interested and I was curious about the outcome.  I was happy that Christian changed his ways
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Always the best author. Doesn't play in to the usual, but always leaves you smiling in the end! Such a great story.
0345803485|2.0|Apparently I'm not a huge fan of romance novels. This book has sold many copies, so someone out there likes it. The author makes many mistakes according to the well described list of things to do and things not to do when writing a novel.<br />When I got to page 190 and read the sixth occurrence of &#34;fingers gently tuck my hair behind my ear&#34;, or something very close to that, I put the book down and decided not to finish it. It was a struggle getting to that point. I kept thinking 'it has to get better, there were so many copies sold!' It kept repeating the same thoughts and dialogue over and over and I gave up.<br />I have learned much from this book - about how not to write a novel.

B00BD6EJRK|4.0|Please don't pay attention to the review of someone who's never even tried this app. Also, you do NOT pay a penny extra for any more filters or anything. EVERYTHING, including, free upgrades, is included when you purchase this app. I suspect that people either don't have a clue as to what they're doing, or they're plants from a competitor with the low reviews and the lies about this app. This is a GREAT photo app that has a ton of features to alter your pictures creatively, whether you're a novice or a more experienced photographer. This is frequently updated to add even more features and is definitely worth the price. This can help you create some really awesome and creative images. More experienced photographers may be a little disappointed in some of the editing features, but it's still worth the price for all the features you get. You won't be disappointed in the features you get. I've created some really incredible photos with this program.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Love the book and it was fairly interesting. It was also pretty good. Good job Rick Jordan and have fundhxv
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Although written for an adolescent audience, this series is also a great read for adults.  The characters draw you in, and I often found it hard to put the book down.  The concept behind the Hunger Games is tragic and goes against human nature, but their tenacity and their will to survive are what keeps you reading to the very end.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Always been a fan of Stephen King, and this novel did not disappoint!  I especially liked how he combined historical facts along with the fiction.  The conspiracy theories around JFK's assassination are woven into a story line that is equally captivating.  Who knew history could be so much fun!

B005S9EKCW|5.0|I did a movie night with my 12 year old daughter and her girl friend.  They chose Les Miserable and we rented it.  I had seen it on Broadway years ago and was a little concerned about them actually liking it and not getting bored with it, since nearly the entire dialogue was sung.  However, they were mesmerized and slack jawed the entire 2 hours and 40 minutes of the movie time!  They woke up the next morning and watched it again then downloaded all of the songs.  From an adult point of view, I thought it was an incredible performance by all of the actors and actresses.  It was very moving and brought me to tears.  I am also thrilled that my young daughter can have such an appreciation for a deeply moving storyline, after all the dreck of most movies aimed at younger audiences.  I am ordering the DVD from Amazon so she can watch it as many times as she wants to.  I highly recommend this movie for family movie nights!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book definitely keep my attention. Unexpected turns coupled with many different emotions run through this book. The author writes in a style that gives the reader a visual and a sense of being there. I found myself thinking of the story line even between reads. That says a lot coming from someone who is not an avid reader!
B0069JBKHI|2.0|Video quality doesn't even come close to HD quality. The quality seems to depend largely on the lighting in the room. Even the slightest change in lighting often makes the picture quality terrible. I haven't been able to get video quality that's even close to the images used on the WiThings website and/or marketing material. I even upgraded my home internet speeds to 25M download / 5M upload and the quality is still sub-par.<br /><br />No way to turn off the night-mode lights so in dimly lit rooms the light keeps turning on and off making it impossible to watch.<br /><br />All of video/audio streams are passing through WiThings servers rather than allowing the apps to talk directly to the baby monitor. I think it's also the reason for a lot of the picture quality problems. If I'm at home why do I need to send my video/audio out of my internet connection to WiThings servers just to download it back to my iPad in the same home? Connecting via Bluetooth isn't a solution unless you live in a small 1 bedroom apartment. I understand that by doing this it makes the monitor more plug-and-play for average users but why not offer the option to stream directly from your monitor?<br /><br />Customer support is terrible. Rather than offering to help I've gotten responses that tell me to return the product if I'm not satisfied.<br /><br />The crib clip is not adjustable and will not fit most newer cribs. Again, I asked about a larger clip and WiThings suggested I return the unit if I wasn't happy.<br /><br />WiThings indicated that viewing the monitor on a computer was coming soon and that was almost a year ago. Still no PC/Mac support.<br /><br />The only positive thing I have to say about this is that it looks very nice. Aside from that I regret choosing this over some of the other options.

B0056JJ1M8|5.0|I have seen a million sports movies... all with a terrific story line, but this one hits close to home for me. I teach in an inner-city school.  My students are a lot like these kids.<br />I highly recommend this one!!!!
1781163243|5.0|I love Halo and I always like to see more pics about the universe. This book has beautiful ilustrations about the weapons, characters, and vehicles from the Halo universe
B001VLXNO2|5.0|I am a long time fan of Jeffrey Archer. This is an excellent treatment of family intrigue for which he is famous. It did not make me want to climb mountains but I enjoyed reading about the adventures.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I watched the movie and loved it so I wanted to have it in my library It arrived very quickly  I would recommend to others
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I accually RLY like it...the only thing is that it gets my notifications a lil late but other than that :-)
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Updated from the original Facebook on my kindle and functionally it is horrible. Cannot expand list on right and it is slower than older version. I wish I could go back to older version at least it worked. It is just like the android version, that don't work either. I have un installed and installed 3 times and it does the same things..
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book was an amazing end to the series!!!! I would highly recommend that you read this book. Before you read this book make sure that you read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire or else you will not understand this book!!!
B000V8MQZI|5.0|I love this album. This was the first Foo Fighters album I ever heard back in 2009. When I put on my headphones and it opened with &#34;The Pretender&#34;, I wasn't sure what to expect. After I got through all 50-ish minutes of it, I immediately replayed the whole album. This is my take on the whole album:<br />1: The Pretender- Great opening track. One of their most acknowledged songs.<br />2: Let It Die- Nice acoustic song to calm you down from the opening, but still has a heavy kick.<br />3: Erase/Replace- Not the best song on this album, but it's got a very steady drum riff I enjoy.<br />4: Long Road To Ruin- Another single. Very Foo-ish, so very catchy.<br />5: Come Alive- Next acoustic song. Kinda sad, but still makes you want to sing along.<br />6: Stranger Things Have Happened- This is one of my favorite FF songs. It starts as just Dave, a guitar and a metronome, but it turns into a duet with Dave and Chris. Very awesome.<br />7: Cheer Up Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)- Another single, but not as known because they never released a video for it. Not my favorite song on the album. Never got into it much. But that's just what I think. It's very fast-paced for this album. It's definetly the fastest song on the album.<br />8: Summer's End- Another very catchy song. It's somewhat pop-ish, though. But it's definetly something that will get stuck in your head.<br />9: Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners- Amazing song. Completely instrumental, just a few guitars. There's a lot going on, though. Very beautiful piece.<br />10: Statues- My personal favorite. Very calming and catchy. Dave's voice at it's best.<br />11: But, Honestly- Probably my least favorite song. It's not bad. It's just not the best on the album in the slightest. But that's just my opinion.<br />12: Home- Fantastic finale song. Mostly just Dave and a piano. Very depressing, but in a nice way. The lyrics are simple, but amazing.<br />So that's the whole album, with all my opinions. The vinyl on this sonuds awesome! Very much worth its price. Definitely buy this album if you want it on vinyl.
B002UAJ0BS|5.0|One of the greatest albums ever released, remastered, ON VINYL! \\"Nevermind\\" as we all know is the album that blew Nirvana sky-high. I will not review each song one by one, because after 20 years, you should know all these songs by heart. I will tell you that there is a major difference between this vinyl release and the 20th anniversary vinyl release. I never bought the 20th anniversary release, but I read some reviews, and became interested. I stumbled upon a video that reviews 3 releases of the vinyl album. You can definitely tell that this version (The ORG version) is the best of the three. I will put the link to the video at the bottom of the review so you can see for yourself. This version is remastered directly from the analog tapes (As it says on a sticker on the packaging), and it sounds exqusite.<br />  Look up on Youtube \\"Nirvana Nevermind Vinyl Shootout\\". It won't let me send the link directly.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Great book slow to start but then we'll worth the wait. Can't wait to read the next two books in the millennium trilogy.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The literary writing was beautiful even thought it was sad becuase holocaust books always are, it was also incredibly beautiful. The writing was intriguing since the narrator of the book is death.
B003U9W3GM|5.0|i read 'With The Old Breed\\", \\"Islands of the Damned\\", and \\"Helmet for My Pillow\\".. there is something that i cannot describe from With The Old Breed.. the way he wrote the memoir, goes deep into your mind, directly buried in your mind...<br /><br />the way he describe about the corps decayed with the guts outside, about the facial expression one of the Japs that he shot at the bunker.. gosh, it's a nightmare back then.<br /><br />other books talking about technical, about logistic, about strategy. but Eugene Sledge talking about feeling, about emotion, what will you feel if you are among them during that time.<br /><br />With The Old Breed, personally I think this is the best memoir that i had ever read.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I heard so many positive comments about the movie, I decided to watch.  The movie was excellent.  The challenge of riding a 35 foot wave seems impossible.  Fear is good and panic is bad. The first rule was to build a thesis, write and essay, and reflect on the holes.  Theory, observation, and inspiration combine with courage come together with raw talent to ride the maverick.  The movie has a strong tension with the abandonment by the father, the surrogate son adoption, the training by padding 36 miles, 4 minute holding breath, the death of the wife, the attempt self destruction, the suffering of the children, and the betrayal by drug peddler friend.  There are numerous themes running between good and evil. The mother inability to keep a job forces a double shift at the pizza restaurant, the drug lords bully tactics implied a network of evil, and the resolution to forgive his father provide a opportunity to become great.  The ocean scenery was a camera delight.  The feel of the ocean was an observer choice,  The characters were like able. The mother seemed to be anti climatic.  This was not another karate kid.  It was a new look at an surfing icon and legend.<br /><br />Why can investors learn from watching \\"chasing mavericks\\"?  A maverick wave contains thousands of tons of water.  The wave currents can change unexpectedly.  The investor can never completely gather all the information relating to his theory. Skill and talent is helpful but not enough. You need to have spiritual and moral strength to survive.  It is possible to surf a maverick wave, but you will be one of only a handful of people capable of winning.  For the most part, 99 percent of the surfers will never try riding the wave.  To ride the wave, you must have a mind like a PHd, observing pattern, thinking about the data, creating theories that make the observations make sense, and be willing to test the theory.  However, in the end, you may not survive.  Sometimes, it is wise not to try and sometimes it is wise to find a more meanful means of focusing ones interest.  In any case, you must have a plan.  The plan must be based on well understood theory and experience.  Learn from your mistakes, don't panic, and work hard to win.  Believe there is a high purpose and meaning to your life and give back to those who are in need and love you.it is wise to find a more meanful means of focusing ones interest.

B004FP1WX0|4.0|Writing , in reverse. ... You really must watch to the end to explain the real grit of the movie.<br /><br />This movie, was, by far, the most interesting movie I have watched in many years.  The plot line moves from stages of fun to playfulness to fear \\"ie. Blair Witch\\".  It's moves from quirky to spooky to  incredibly sad.  The events are real but they play out in ways you would never guess. The Internet and Social Networking are truly the monsters in the movie.<br /><br />This movie sheds a light on the creepy and REAL side of the \\"the Network\\"...It  shows you  how much the Internet can hurt  you and give you an alternative reality at same time.  The husband sums it up all too well at the very end.....he's just as complicit as his wife in the enormously complicated plot but is a willing accomplice.  He loves her and would do anything to help her.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to those who  like speedy motion but also relate to complex character development.  The story  is a true story and cannot be disregarded.  It's a great movie. Do not believe anything the characters say....It will all be different by the movie's end.
1451695195|5.0|I am so glad that this man witnessed all of this and was able to write it in a book for us to read.  God is so good.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|The plot is excellent and the writing is good. Sci-fi for old people... Great for youngsters too. I will read it again when I turn 70.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet. If you love to listen to love songs sung in Spanish, Italian, French and Portuguese, this is the music CD for you! This is like 3 music CD's in one. There is the very languid music from Brazil - Bossa Nova, a few Spanish love songs,French songs and of course, Italian songs. I've enjoyed this CD very much and I'm very partial to the Bossa Nova songs. It's probably the reason why I bought the CD in the first place. His duet with Nelly Furtado on Corcovado (Quiet Nights) is, in my humble opinion, the best version of that song ever. \\"Girl from Ipanema\\" is a grand version (my apologies to Antonio Carlos Jobim) of that classic Bossa Nova tune. He puts Frank Sinatra's version to shame.<br /><br />There is going to be a DVD version of this CD - although I don't know when it's going to be released. It's been shown on PBS for the spring drive this year. This is similar to what was done with the Amore CD (Under the desert Sky). I wish Andrea would tour with this format. It's a great way to enjoy his music. Kudos to David Foster for a magnificent job producing this CD. Some of the arrangements are just brilliant. Lastly, kudos also to Ramon Stagnaro. What a guitar player - he plays it like I fantasize how to play that darn instrument. Let's not forget the violin soloist on Love in Portofino. So many artists to thank but you know, these people make the music. Andrea Bocelli is a great artist but his music is further enhanced by the great musicians who back him.
1451696191|5.0|Charlie has decided to write letters to an anonymous friend about his life. He has just experienced loss, and after a teacher encourages him to \\"participate\\", he meets a new group of friends. I will stop there before the spoiler police goes beserk! If I could compare this book to another it would be Catcher in the Rye, ironically one of Charlie's fav books. But it has its own voice. We are all a little weird so Charlie was very endearing. He's only 15 and he idealizes people and puts everyone before himself. It is only near the end when demons come out that we realize Charlie is a survivor. Despite this, he still has hope, he still loves and refuses to hurt others, except in self defense. The style of writing is so descriptive and beautiful that Charlie feels like a real person to me and that's the greatest compliment of all (besides getting compared to Salinger :)). A+
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game. nothing compares to my own horse but when I am not with him, I love playing this.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Very cool game, hard to believe I'm playing this on my Kindle Fire HD. Cool graphics, great game play. I don't don't quite get the multiplayer just yet, I played, won the match but lost most of my artifacts? Aside from that it's a fun game, gets pretty tough at the higher levels.

B0099G3I96|2.0|This seems to be a lot more in the direction of Gwen's solo career than old school No Doubt. There really isn't any track that I want to listen to.

1609611543|5.0|This book is direct about what to eat and what to avoid. It also explains how modern day wheat is a product of genetic modification. Dr. Davis advises readers to avoid wheat, and to also be careful with rice, corn, and potatoes. He points out that many gluten-free foods which use rice/corn to substitute for wheat can still cause big surges in blood sugar. He says legumes and fruit also need to be limited.<br />I had major blood sugar swings after eating starchy food (blood sugar went from 70 mg/dl before eating to 110 after eating and then down to 60 very rapidly), even though my glucose readings stayed within normal parameters. This blood sugar roller coaster ride had me feeling lightheaded and hungry all the time. Doctors told me to eat starch or sugar every two hours to keep my blood sugar up. I thought that was the way to go until I read this book.<br /> After two weeks of following the guidelines in this book, I can now go for hours without feeling hungry. No more dizzy spells. And I lost four pounds in two weeks.<br /> I still test my sugar regularly an hour or two after meals, and after giving up wheat and other grains/starchy vegetables, my numbers have stabilized.
6304100507|5.0|I purchased the VHS version of the movie, and when it arrived it was in very good quality. This movie is great, and I loved it as a kid and still love it as a teenager. The characters stick with you and the music plays in your head all day every day. It's a classic Disney movie with the talking animals, yet of course has its own uniqueness about it. I love it, and I think I'll watch it now.
B006TGWY3K|5.0|I bought this song for my boyfriend.  He is a big fan of Lacuna Coil and would recommend the song to his friends
B001XCW6W4|5.0|I bought the British version for 2 reasons. 1. I loved the cover a whole lot better. 2. I had no worries if it was the remastered version or not. It is identical to the US version in every aspect. They are releasing a steelbook version next month, at a reasonable price. [[ASIN:B00C2IPB66 Gladiator [Blu-ray]]]
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I must say I enjoyed every single song on this album. When I heard samples I knew I had to have it and I absolutely love it. My favorite song is Future because the guitar solo is the best thing ever, but every song is just as amazing. Definitely worth the buy.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very good book. Very different but very heartfelt. I enjoyed the story line, it was out of my usual realm of books I read. Now I shall go watch the movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Different from anything I've read before. Excellently written. There are some battle scenes that I needed to read over again I'm not sure if I missed some details or what but I was confused. Other than that you end up caring for everyone even the side characters.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|The critics were wrong and Disney dropped the ball on marketing. I read the book after and found that they did change a lot, but I loved the movie in its own right. It's a shame it didn't do well in the box office because I'd love to see more of this story that inspired Star Wars.
1476719071|5.0|this book..i loved it. it is not just for young people. i was drawn in by the characters..the story..i read it in 24hrs.. it was great.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Beautiful film that had a great plot line. Faster paced than the book. Only wished that I bought the movie instead of rented, because it was so good.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this book was an enjoyable read..i read it and then gave it to my oldest daughter to read. she also enjoyed it.<br />this book is worth the buy..the characters bring you and and you feel a part..

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|My old mouse broke so I thought i'd buy a gaming mouse, after looking though all of them I came by this and thought it seemed like a good one.  The ergonomic style was just what I was looking for and feels great in your hand. The mouse buttons under the scroll wheel are hard to press but it's never a bad idea to have more buttons, since it's not like they get in the way durring regular use and gaming and i'm sure some people like them.  It's a great mouse for the price, software is easy to set up and use.<br /><br />  If anything could be said for cons, in my opinion would be the option to just set the mouse buttons as &#34;mouse button 1-9&#34; since then it makes it alot easier to use the same profile for multiple games.  I'd recommend this mouse to anyone looking for an ergonomic gaming mouse that has alot of extra buttons and is still within a very acceptable price range.
B00B52F278|4.0|Good
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book has helped me realize that I may never go wrong when listening to my heart. Among many other things, I have learned the lessons of life that had been presenting themselves to me all my life but that I could not understand. I will carry with me these virtues and will re-read this book so that I never forget that the universe is truly of one making and that, maktub.
B00BI6SSMC|3.0|I loved [[ASIN:B000TQZ7O4 The Shepherd's Dog]], but when Sam turned from lush psychedelia to flat-out pop, I lost interest.  This record is another attempt at folk music filtered through Steely Dan.  Somehow it manages to sound both stripped-down and over-arranged.  Vibes, bells, horns, strings - every song seems to contain something unnecessary, obvious, or just plain irritating.  I'm glad that Sam appreciates Charles Mingus (\\"Lovers' Revolution\\"), but do jazzy horn charts suit these particular tunes?  The extra instruments are used in a cinematic fashion, to underscore moods that don't need embellishment.  This feels like an artist straining for effect.  Still, there's something interesting about an ambitious synthesis that doesn't quite work.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|My sister gave me this book at 10 pm. I couldn't stop reading it until I finished at at 3am on a work night! That's how addictive it is. This is the first book in years that had that effect on me. This story was well written with lovable character and a theme that relevant in this age of reality tv programming. If I could I would give it 10 stars
B005LAII44|2.0|G. I. Joe - Retaliation is the latest in dumbed-down \\"action\\" entertainment loosened on moviegoers.  Loosely based on the characters in the animated series, the latest installment is about the \\"busiest\\" movie I've ever seen--and delivers almost no entertainment and manages to make lititle or no sense.  The plot is all over the place, it has way too many sub-plots (none of which I cared one iota about), and is just a scripted, by-the-book example of what passes for \\"action\\" in the 'Hills these days.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Chu and starring Channing Tatum, Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson, and Bruce Willis, GIJ gave us a lot of characters NOT to care about.  Both Tatum and Willis had to have made a ton of bucks just to have their names associated with this debacle.  Tatum's character is killed pretty early in the movie and Bruce Willis still has that \\"Bruce Willis Acting\\" down--running the gauntlet from A to B.  He always looks like someone is holding a small t*rd under his nose and he seems to be totally disinterested in this movie.  Not only that, but him appearing in \\"action\\" movies is like watching your grandfather participate in MMA; that dog just ain't gonna' hunt.  As for The Rock, well, I hate to tell you this, but I can smell what the Rock is cooking and it STINKS.  You're entire schtick is getting tired.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG-13 for language and violence, last 110 hours...er, minutes, and it'll be the longest 110 minutes of your life.  Don't waste your time.
B0098J0WWK|1.0|There are several versions of this book offered on Amazon, and when I ordered mine there was no way to tell the difference between them.  Since I only needed the book for an English 102 class, I ordered an inexpensive version that looked like it would be a cheap reprint. Imagine my surprise when I found out the last chapter is missing!    One of the other students in my class found this book free online, but his version was also missing the last chapter.  I am assuming based on that information that this book was simply printed from that. This is the exact text printed in this book, complete with the book previews at the end. As far as I can tell the other Amazon editions also end in the same place.     If you feel like reading the first four chapters of this book here it is:  [...]    The whole book, including Chapter 5 which seems to disappear so easily, is here:  [...]

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is really really good, for reasons I can't understand. I find that the fact that it has the most wonderful sentence I have ever read, \\" And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.\\" This is a must read for anyone looking for a good book. Just remember to be a filter, not a sponge, because although it is easy reading, it has deeper, more complex meanings in the background. Stephen Chbosky did an excellent job!
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|This is a fairly interesting film about the film Psycho and its famous director and his wife.  Mirren and Hopkins are excellent.  It's just that the script is lacking in some respects, especially with the scenes showing Hitch imagining that he is interacting with Ed Gein. Odd choice and it does not quite work.
B009EAO38C|5.0|My 12 year old son listens to this CD over and over and over! They are so talented. Well worth it.
B000063JDE|4.0|I will be the first to say that this film is not for everyone.  It has a female character who is degraded while her husband and son are held hostage, a young male who gets himself into a terrible mess with criminals, and the photography will not be to everyone's liking either.<br />If you can get past that, you may be fascinated by Lynch's exploration of the sick underbelly of an otherwise bucolic town called Lumberton, where love and happiness seem elusive but are still worth seeking.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|I thought it was a cool buy.  it came with a lot of special features that showed how they made the movie building up to halo 4. it also had a little bit of extra movie footage that wasn't in the series that we saw on xbox live or youtube so that was cool. i would recommend this but it just depends on what anyone who wants to buy it thought of the series.
B004KBSQOW|4.0|Great album of IZ's works. The CD case was cracked because of poor packing ( little packing materials in the box ) but didn't damage the CD.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|I had never tried this game before but loved it once I tried it. definetely worth the two dollars for the full game.
0307476464|2.0|The way this book is written is very, very strange. Enormous amounts of detail are put into pointless events, and then there is no explanation of things that the reader (well me) actually wanted to know, for example there is no explanation of the supernatural elements in this book at all (and they are very strange supernatural phenomena). Finding out why everything in the book was actually happening was why I continued reading it and allowed me to suspend my disbelief somewhat. I felt like there should have been some kind of epiphany where all the dissonant voices of the book came together, but there was nothing. If the story was tied together nicely at the end this would have made the book a whole lot better.<br /><br />The love story also had a pretty terrible premise I found, and as the book dragged on I found myself questioning why these two people had such a bond. But this was yet another facet of the story that was barely and terribly explained.<br /><br />I finished this book feeling entirely unsatified and would not recommend it, but the interesting writing style still got me to finish the book, so I guess it deserves two stars, it wasnt the worst thing I've ever read.
B008MM9630|5.0|awesome and additive best game ever n my vote teaches u responsibility n rewards u can get by doin good I recommend to everyone who loves fairies and farming
B002VHI8FE|4.0|This book is very well written, and leaves you wanting more. Most of the characters are unlikable to begin with, but their stories begin to draw you in with their rare displays of humanity and goodness. These books show just how much effective character development can flip your views of a character, and all the characters are made up of plenty of shades of grey. No easy black and white good and evil tropes are relied upon in this book. Essentially this whole series is worth reading for the character development, and the world is also pretty awesome. Would have been interesting if more of the magic system was explored but I guess it wasnt really what the books focus was.<br />Note: if you only like your main characters as upstanding citizens battling against the forces of evil, this book and series are probably not for you, but for those looking for fantasy that is a little different and that makes use of a wide range of anti-heroes look no further you've hit gold.
B009NH6AOQ|4.0|Season 3 is great though better in its first half.  I recently caught the last 8 episodes and enjoyed it but had a few misgivings about the way some things played out.<br /><br />Initially, coming into Season 3, I thought the new look was great.  Still do.  Gone were the clean haircuts and clothes - these guys now look like they've just come back from Woodstock!  Plus the characters and story seem to have matured some. Some. Some episodes feel like they were written on the fly though.  By the time we start getting involved with the Governor's group, an element of cheese creeps into things.  He's a pretty bad guy I guess.  A little cheesy too.<br /><br />I liked the entrance of Michonne (and her sword) in this season.  Oh, and that's another reason the second half bugged me a little.<br /><br />  * SPOILERS *<br /><br />That whole second to the last episode where Rick actually considers giving her up to the Governor??? Say what???!!!<br /><br />That was a BIT unbelievable. Could Rick be so stupid as to think you could even kind of take that snake the Governor at his word?  And more unbelievable yet, that afterwards Michonne could even look at Rick, let alone agree to continue living with them.  Seriously, that was so stupid my opinion of the whole series went down a notch.  Rick putting Merle up to capturing and delivering her to the Governor?  Even Merle has the sense not to do it!  And lucky for the series.  But how do you go back after that and take Rick even a little bit serious.  If you're Michonne, that is. The girl's got powers of forgiveness even mightier than her sword.  Actually she is quite an interesting character, and she often says quite a lot without saying a word.<br /><br />On the other interesting developments side, little Carl is becoming a killer - by necessity from the looks of things. After killing another boy, Hershel tries to tell Carl's father (Rick) that Carl nearly shot the other kid in cold blood \\"as he was putting down his weapon\\".. but it didn't look like the kid had really made up his mind to put down that weapon.  We, the viewers, were there!  So, this is the second time I come to question good Hershel's judgement.  The first time (this season) was when he was praying with his daughters from the Bible as they were all planning to capture and deliver Michonne to the Governor.  What a jerk.<br /><br />Anyway, in a nutshell, I liked the tone and pace of this season perhaps more than the first two seasons although Season 3 while faster paced overall, never had any huge surprises like in Season 2 when they found the lost little girl in the barn, now a zombie.  That was a real upper cut. Boom!! We were knocked senseless for a moment and very surprised to see their search come around full circle like that.. when we were least expecting it.  No. Less surprises like that in this season, but still enjoyable anyway. I'll be watcing Season 4 when it comes out.  Just hope they can up the writing a notch.  No complaints in the special effects department.

0307719219|4.0|Why Nations Fail is a book that everyone should read and think about. However the theory proposed by the authors is flawed. The authors are professors in economics and government and thus it is no surprise that they conclude that nations fail because of political and economic institutions.  When the only tool you have is a hammer, everything begins to look like a nail.<br /><br />To begin with they fail to define their terms, specifically \\"fail\\" and \\"sustainable.\\"  Their hypothesis is that nations fail because they have \\"extractive\\" political institutions that in turn lead to extractive economic institutions, Conversely, nations succeed when they have \\"inclusive\\" political institutions that result in inclusive economic institutions.  In other words, democracy leads to capitalism which is good and authoritarianism leads to economic stagnation which is bad.  Furthermore, this view assumes that every authoritarian leader and government is out to get what it can for the elites and ignore the rest of the people and every democratic leader wants to provide for the people. This view ignores people such as Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore, an authoritarian leader who clearly had the best interests of his people at heart and even King Abdullah in Saudi Arabia who has undertaken a number of efforts for people in his country.<br /><br />They begin with an interesting example. After Columbus discovered the New World it was the Spanish who were in the best position to take advantage and Spanish conquistadors came largely to Central and South America and employed the strategy of capturing the local chief and forcing him to give them gold and other resources.  After the defeat of the Spanish Armada Great Britain had the opportunity to come to the Americas but had to settle for what was left over, namely the coast of North America. The British initially tried the Spanish strategy but failed because the local chiefs were too strong and wary and in any case there was no gold. The initial colony at Jamestown of 500 dwindled to 50. At that point the British tried coercion imposing the British manorial system on the remaining colonists. A lord was appointed and given the land, which the colonists were supposed, to farm as tenants, but that plan did not work either because the colonists could just go up the road a piece and start a new colony.  Finally, since nothing else worked the British tried incentives--political and economic inclusion and voila! the future Silicon Valley was born.  Well it is a nice story.  But there is more.<br /><br />Why did the Industrial Revolution start in Britain and not elsewhere?  The answer is the Glorious Revolution (in which William of Orange and Mary took over rule in Britain from James II thus moving the country from an extractive political system to an inclusive one which led to an inclusive economic system and success followed in due course.<br /><br />There is certain much to be said in favor of these ideas, but they do not represent the whole picture of why nations succeed or fail.  The authors disparage Jared Diamond's view that geography (and natural resources) plays a significant part in the success or failure of a country. But the reality is that the United States, for example, has benefited greatly from its geographic position, protected on both sides by wide oceans and north and south by weak neighbors and its abundance of natural resources, Similarly they discredit Max Weber's view that the Protestant Ethic was a major factor in Europe's success, noting that many successful Asian countries are not Christian. True but the mentality (work hard and strive for success) is not merely a Protestant phenomenon.  They also fail to adequately take into account the influence of specific leaders, the so-called \\"Great Man' theory. Human beings affect outcomes including and especially political and economic institutions. Would WW II have occurred if there was no Hitler? Would the British have resisted as well without Churchill? What would Russia have done without Stalin or for that matter what would Russia have been without Lenin?  Instead they refer to \\"small differences and critical junctures.\\"<br /><br />Extractive countries such as China, Russia and Saudi Arabia may be successful now but this success is \\"not sustainable.\\"  But nothing lasts forever and the inclusive countries of Europe are now in a severe economic crisis while the extractive BRIC countries continue to prosper. And what about Singapore, authoritarian yet hardly extractive and quite successful? In Saudi Arabia last year the non-natural resource part of the economy grew faster than the resource part and while King Abdullah and his family extract they also give substantially.  Then there is India, until recently a failure, yet strongly democratic.<br /><br />For that matter how inclusive is the United States? Obama came to the San Francisco Bay Area recently and stayed at the home of a billionaire and spent his time with other wealthy people. I live here but needless to say he had no interest in meeting me!<br /><br />In sum, Why Nations Fail is a book that will challenge and inform you and get you to thinking about the world and how it is changing.  The subject is complex and not definable by one paradigm.chill? What would Russia have done without Stalin or for that matter what would Russia have been without Lenin?

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My partner and I are not married, but we do live together and have a newborn. Anyone who has a child knows the strain they can put on a partnership, but not entirely their fault. I'm not putting any blame on her, just trying to point out the struggle of being a parent. We started to be shaky when we moved in. In total we have been dating since sophomore year of high school, now completing our sophomore year of college. So personally, I would say that we have it harder than most couples, we wanted a child and we prepared for her, and even after having her, we both have continued school and work. Point be, this book has helped us discover the areas where we clash a lot and the reasons behind why, and not necessarily how to correct them, but how to avoid them completely. This book won't save your relationship, but it will show you how to improve it if both partners are willing, but most importantly, wanting to work at it.

1481913417|5.0|A few weeks ago, I wrote a review of Stanley Fish's [[ASIN:006184053X How to Write a Sentence: And How to Read One]]. The book was marvelous but I had to disagree with Fish's somewhat disparaging comments about this book. I understand why he felt the way he did. However, \\"The Elements of Style\\" has had such longetivity because its basic rules and guides are still relevant. No, it may not promote the elegant or dramatic or aesthetically pleasing writing that Fish admires but that was not William Strunk's and/or E.B. White's intention. This book advocates clarity and brevity. It advocates a limited style but it stresses effective sentence structures and writing. Perhaps I will use Mr. Fish's book as a supplemental text for my more advanced writing classes. But in these days of technical jargon and texting abbreviations with all its corruptive influence, I will rely on this slender little thing for my intermediate classes a little longer.

B000E41MRC|5.0|Wikipedia has a good definition of \\"groupthink\\":  \\"Group members try to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation of alternative ideas or viewpoints, and by isolating themselves from outside influences.\\"  To learn how the Nazis gained an \\"us against the world\\" mentality, watch this propaganda documentary of the 1934 Nuremberg rally.  You will notice in the speeches that emotionalism overtakes rationality and that Hitler, while anything but good-looking (I still do not see how he could seem sexy to women, even with the huge media campaign trying to make him so), did have huge charisma as a speaker, specializing in starting calmly and working up into a frenzy.  The bigness of the event and sense of unity and stability were supposed to make Nazism look really good.<br /><br />It is interesting to try to understand the contradiction in Nazi ideology--classnessness (the wealthy and the poor all have important roles in the new Germany), but elitism and hateful racism.  The extent to which the swastika was worshipped can only be appreciated when you see a huge Nazi rally like on this documentary.  The swastika represented the progression of history in Nazi terms:  people dying for Germany (there's no afterlife), and then future generations appreciating that sacrifice and again dying for Germany, to help it expand through the world.  There was no further justification of why German culture was superior, other than propaganda films showing other races looking ugly.  I was surprised by the lack of rationale given to the Nazis at the Nuremberg rally in this film.  They don't learn WHY furthering the master-race/Fatherland matters, or why they're supposedly superior to the rest of the world; it's irrelevant.<br /><br />This documentary preserves the aura of splendor that Hitler originally had, and gives much food for thought about the danger of groupthink.  Germany had a strong military tradition and unsuccessful experiment with democracy in the 20s (it wasn't able to save them from the Great Depression), so it was not as hard for Germany to accept Hitler as it would be for America.  An economic crisis can do a lot to make people willing to relinquish freedom.  Hitler's humanistic optimism about the ability of German youth to perfect Germany, and defense of his power by saying the German people wanted/supported him, are repeated dangerously today by the Democratic Party.  His populism's only moral defense was that the people were helped economically and that the Aryan race was best served by an unwavering leader like himself.  He also had a skill at making sure people didn't get JUST a message of hate toward foreigners (especially Jews), but a positive message of German pride as well.<br /><br />Sometimes you can best detect a dictator by what he doesn't say, not just what he does say.  Hitler never emphasized his subservience to the people (even if he acknowledged it sometimes, it was not EMPHASIZED), or expressed a sense of humility before God for his moral choices.  Listening to the speeches on this documentary is a good way to learn how a demagogue, manipulator of the people, works:  emotionalism, humanistic optimism which ignores the need for God or accountability to God for our moral choices, and flattering the people.  I suppose Nazi racism was at least partially motivated by the need to make the voter base feel more important, so the Jews had to be made \\"the enemy\\" in the public's eyes.

I don't have a problem with pushing the envelope, but this film goes way beyond that premise. This is the prime reason that I do not trust reviews or the actors who choose their roles. This movie is trash and the actors, producers or director should re examine their goals regarding the work they do.

0785139168|4.0|I never thought that I would see the day a classic of literature would be adapted into comic book format, much less that I would greatly enjoy this type of adaption. I mean, I love comics, but this type of comic book? Can it possibly be adapted well at all? The answer is a definite yes.<br /><br />In Marvel Comics' adaptation of Jane Austen's beloved classic Pride and Prejudice, the story was presented in it's most essential points. Adapted for comic book format by Nancy Butler and Hugo Petrus, much of the story in the original novel was interpreted from the thoughts of the characters to showing, via the artwork, what was occuring. So, naturally, some of the parts of the book were dropped in favor of the most important plot points.<br /><br />Really, this is not a huge problem for me, as this is a necessity for any adaption, comic or otherwise. You simply can not adapt everything perfectly, even if you try to do so. Sometimes, in order to convey the gist of what happens in a tale, you have to change, or even add to, the story. For instance, though it was trashed for adding too many scenes, the Disney and Walden Media adaptation of The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe added material to show the rivalry between Peter and Edmund, to illustrate the point that CS Lewis stresses, that Edmund isn't as bad as he appears to be. Also, the air raids, well known from experiences or pictures to the audience when the books were first written, were shown to bring the point home to modern audiences. That is only that movie, however. The other two Narnia films from Walden Media were trash, in my opinion.<br /><br />The point of the above paragraph is to illustrate just what type of \\"changes\\" in the story were brought to bear in this comic adaptation. Basically, it's a case of showing instead of telling. Instead of having long paragraphs telling what the characters are thinking, they show it via their facial expressions, so on.<br /><br />Really, this was the second-best adaptation I have seen of P & P, right below the 1995 BBC mini-series starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firthe. It was very, very faithful to the story, and gave you the same gist as the original novel. None of this modern penchant of making any of the three sisters of Jane and Lizzie look better was there, and none of absolving either Darcy or Lizzie. These are two mistakes in adapting this story that occur far too often.<br /><br />The only real criticism I have of this graphic novel adaptation of P & P is the art, or rather one aspect thereof. Don't get me wrong, the art was gorgeous, and actually made things look like they would have looked (for the most part) at that time in the late 18th/early 19th century. The problem with the art was how it made the characters look. It seems that the artists of comic books can not draw anyone looking average or slightly attractive. Instead, everyone must look either stunningly beautiful, or horrifically ugly. In this story, literally EVERYONE was stunning except for Mrs Bennett (the selfish mother), who was made out to be way too unappealing, to say the least. They were drawn in such as way that was out of line with the novel. I wish these comic book folks would draw average looking folks.<br /><br />Of course, it isn't that bad that this is all that I can critique in this adaptation, and I heartily recommend it for any fans of comic books, the Classics, or both.e second-best adaptation I have seen of P & P, right below the 1995 BBC mini-series starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firthe.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona 4 was one of the greatest JRPG's of all time. Now its been improved and made portable.<br /><br />Having entered this franchise with P3P I couldn't wait to get my hands on Golden and I haven't been disappointed.  Having played through the game several times nearly 300 hours later I'm still uncovering storylines I'd overlooked and have only recently even bothered with any of the side-quests.<br /><br />For those who played the original I still highly recommend picking up golden the additions for the vita add many hours of extra gameplay.  The Vita's ability to pause anywhere makes this game all the better on the go.<br /><br />It's also worth keeping in mind that much like the final fantasy series the plot lines of persona games are completely stand alone (exception being Arena) so you wont find yourself missing out entering the franchise with this game.<br /><br />Lastly this game's difficulty level's have no impact on story so it's possible to go through for strictly story on easy without ever bothering with the dungeon grinding or you can set to the hardest difficulty for a huge challenge<br /><br />PS: This is what a Vita game should be,  A console sized experience on the go.  Not 10 minute campaigns more suited as a cell phone app

Janelle Monae* (probably their most known song, the title should give a clue;D)<br />4) Carry On (it's sort of a slow, empowering song)<br />& then these two are one's I didn't know until last night when I played the CD for the first time and they immediately caught my attention...<br />5) It Gets Better (I love the beginning, the first words are: &#34;What have we done; oh my God.&#34;)<br />9) One Foot (It's also an empowering song, lyrics that help: &#34;I'll put one foot, in front of the other one.&#34;)<br /><br />-<br /><br />That was my review on fun.<br />& just a short review on amazon itself:<br />awesome:D<br />Haven't been disappointed once/yet (&#34;yet&#34; so I don't jinx myself)<br />~ Liz
B000002KDX|5.0|This album/cd is a must-have for anyone that appreciates vocals and group acoustic guitarwork. The vocal and instrumental blending of Beckley, Bunnell and Peek in the early days of America is unmatched. Sure, the original recording could have been engineered better relative to today's standards, but there isn't an average song...they're all amazing.
B0014DQSGW|5.0|Enjoyed this movie mainly because I love Sandra Bullock's acting ability.  Her  &#34;acting&#34; role just comes across as so natural.  This was an entertaining movie which you will have you laughing out loud.
B004WCTLNY|3.0|Unlike apparently many others, I didn't assume that the AB operatives were agents of some \\"divine\\" entity; I thought of them as representatives of an extraterrestrial civilization that was monitoring developments on Earth for purposes of its own.<br /><br />Also, it seemed to me that the consequences of whatever choice that David Norris made were fairly pedestrian. If he doesn't get the so-called \\"love of his life,\\" then she becomes a world-famous dancer. If he gets her, then she doesn't. I would have been more impressed if the consequences had been something of more world-shaking importance. For example, if he gets the girl, there will be an all-out nuclear war in twenty years. Now THAT would put something on David Norris' mind!
B000001C6M|5.0|In the best and most evil way possible. Great, great, great must have. Reign in Blood is another must have.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Like a poem, it is meant to be read twice. First to enjoy the fabulous, well written plot, a love born from loss. The second time to peel back the layers of emotions buried in the poetry slams! I laughed. I cried. Buried underneath the layers is a message that life is meant to be lived and loved.
B000001FFR|5.0|This album is definitely a must have. I hadn't really herd Anthrax much until I bought this album (simply because of the amazing price). I'm thoroughly impressed and recommend to any Slayer, Exodus or Megadeth fan.
B00AVPYT8I|2.0|I didn't like this app at all and I really didn't get to use it. I didn't like the fact that it was telling me I had to get the Amazon app downloaded. I mean I assumed that since I am using and Amazon device that would not be necessary. I was turned off and uninstalled it from my device immediately.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|This album is utterly amazing. I was drawn to Steven Wilson because of the Storm Corrosion album he did with Opeth's front man. This is exceptional. In the mood for a modern Pink Floyd? Give this a listen.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Just enough challenge, little short but still had great graphics and a decent storyline...the hidden object part was ok, would like to have seen a few more &quot;brainwashing&quot; games, sort of abrupt on the ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super fun game you get to jump and duck over trains. You can also buy characters with the coins that you collect.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Wonderful book. If you like video games and trivia, pick this up. Not for someone who is looking for your typical Sci-Fi, this one has heart, too.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Not to not to bad at all. The controls are a little weird but once you get you get used to them this game is great.  KILL KILL KILL and KILL some more.  The game will keep playing even when you need to put it down.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My son hates the single pacifier with nothing hanging onto it. So I tried this monkey pacifier and he immediately fell in love with it. He sucks on it during nap and sleep time. It's also a lifesaver for us new parents when he cries in the middle of the night. I just pop this pacifier back in and he will fall back asleep. As of today, my son is 12 months and still uses it. He now grabs it himself in the middle of the night and put himself back to sleep. My son's favorite pacifier and buddy.
B001458MI2|5.0|Christina is no stranger to good music. Her voice is beautiful and powerful and these songs really keep me going!
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|Nto an actual sequel, per se, but a similar story line with a better budget.  VERY similar to the original it adds extra dialog, action and special effects.  Another must see
0719079276|5.0|I didn't discover this book until halfway through a graduate level class on Postcolonial Theory. This would be after trying to keep my head above water while reading Derrida in the original language. I wish I'd read it years ago.<br /><br />Despite its bland title and intimidating chapter headings, this book is very accessible. Each chapter takes a different ideological camp of literary theory -- from Post-structuralism to New Historicism -- and breaks it down into understandable terms. A brief history of each theory is given, along with an introduction to important scholars and influential works in the field. For me, the most helpful aspect was the practical application: the bullet pointed lists of what scholars from each camp actually do, and the mini-essays interpreting specific poems and short stories using the principles of each camp of literary criticism. (Several poems and short stories are included in the appendix and it was fascinating to see the same story interpreted differently depending on the chapter.)<br /><br />For me, reading this book was like discovering the cipher to a code that I was already supposed to know. The articles for my class, which are littered with references to Foucault, textual deconstruction, Bhabha, and Narratology, are beginning to make sense. The genius of this book is its ability to take obtuse terms and abstract concepts and to bring them down to earth. The author writes in an easy going, casual voice, and isn't afraid to poke fun at his own profession at times. After Derrida, it's a breath of fresh air.
B000WC3864|5.0|Sam Rami's cult classic is just that.  ALthough the remake is VERY different from this one, the original is amazing for a low busget film/  They did something very different with this film and I can't help but love it
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Thus app was just what I needed ! I use it to write down anything & the password lock come  in handy ! I'd recommend this to anyone & everyone !
B003PBB4ME|1.0|this thing seemed cool and affordable, however it doesnt fit my dslr with the batter grip on it, and I found that I never really used this thing. I had a hard time attaching it to tripod as wel..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so good and fun can't wait till I get it on My I pod  5  and android<br />16
B005LAIIQC|4.0|This is a really good movie that caught me by surprise.  I wasn't sure which direction the series was going to take after the last movie.  Jeremy Renner pulls off a pretty good programmed killer.  Lots of action.  The plot was a bit twisted in the first third but I figured it out.
1476719071|5.0|I just bought this book the other day and I am totally hooked! I am only on page 70 but I just can't wait to get further! What a great story so far! And it is just that, a story. It is fine if you don't like it, but it is meant to take us to a different place. Into the imagination of someone else, and so far, this is a great ride!! ;)
B007REV4YI|5.0|This took a turn I wasn't expecting.  A less-than-studly Bond?  Who would have thought??  Still, it captured my attention and I really loved it.  Bardiem is a great bad guy.  Completely off his rocker, which is a Bond movie requirement.
B002EWD0I6|1.0|Anyone else remember those sappy LDS proselytization commercials, the ones that always ended with everyone learning some moral lesson & hugging? Ugh. Same level of philosophical & emotional depth in Lark Rise to Candleford. And actually, I think those commercials may have had slightly better acting.<br />To be fair, plenty of people seem to genuinely enjoy the lightness & \\"wholesomeness\\" of this series-- though I would argue that it's not even wholesome. The plotline of the 2nd episode centers mostly on a mother who, faced with the prospect of going to debtor's prison, steals her son's savings & spends it all at the pub. At the end of the episode, the narrator claims that nobody could dislike this woman, & I had to shut off the tv in disgust. I dislike alcoholic & neglectful parents very much, actually! & I dislike it when they're portrayed as cute & harmless! Oooh, it makes me  mad.<br />Anyways, if you, like me, love your costume dramas with a bit of grit & realism & straight-up fine acting, like, say, The Cazalets, or Berkeley Square, or (Minnie Driver's) The Governess, you might just not want to waste your money on Lark Rise.
B0092SPYQG|4.0|I've seen them in concert once and I really enjoyed it.  I think it was at either the Mayhem Fest or Uproar Fest a couple years ago.  They continue to churn out great music.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Gotta be one of the best.  Writer, Chris Kyle worried about others writing about him.<br />So he decided (reluctantly) to \\"write his own story\\" - to make sure \\"it was correct\\" !<br />This autobiography begins in Iraq 'protecting troops'.  It then races on deployment<br />as a SEAL,  he describes ordinance, tells us his preferences in sniper rifle(s),<br />including the well made GA Precision.  Time and again he mentions \\"Learning to Perceive\\".<br />A poignant moment as the author talks about wearing the 911 firefighters cap from historic<br />city fire engine house in NY.  The B&W pictures are well illustrated.  Here in NZ a TV<br />programme \\"Strike Back\\" is based on many stories Chris Kyle has written.  Born 1974,<br />sadly he was murdered on a shooting range Feb; 2013 by a former marine.  A wonderful<br />touch is the 'added' inserts by his wife.  Great to get the 'wife-at-home' perspective.<br />\\"Helping each other out - that's America\\" could be his motto.  RIP CK.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|I really enjoyed the plot and the tension presented in this show.  I had a hard time getting by some of the technical inaccuracies.  I was left wondering who the military advisor for this show was, if there actually was one.  There are way too many for this day and age and I was put off by them.  My girlfriend watched with me and didn't like the way I shouted at the TV.  Yes, I'm a Marine, so errors will stand out more to me.  Despite all of that, I still enjoyed the show and I'm looking forward to seeing Season 2.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|A story of a Harvard professors slow slide into early onset Alzheimers.  It took a minute for me to realize when she was sitting in the class waiting for the teacher to show up that SHE was the teacher but didn't remember that.  Sad when she is describing the pretty lady with the baby and the older gentleman.  Then you realize she doesn't remember her daughter, grandchild and husband.  It was interesting what she did to compensate and deal with the disease and how friends and family are affected and how they cope. It was a fascinating story and a good read...but sometimes sad.  I bet anyone over 50 years old sometimes wonders if they are on that road.  Hey! It is natural to forget what you went into that room for!  :-)  But not to be totally lost in your own very familiar neighborhood.  Sadly Alices story couldn't end any other way.<br /><br /> I had a dream one night that I was recognizing the signs in myself.  I guess reading this book right after I found out a friend has early onset Alzheimers just has me in that frame of mind.  I don't have an eloquent critique.  It was just a good book.
B009HSVHV2|4.0|My favorite band of all time.  I love what they do and what they've contributed to rock and roll.  I see them in concert whenever they're in my area and I have practically everything they've released.  This CD is just as good as anything else and proves that you're never to old to rock on!
B0081SPK0I|4.0|THE GAME IS ALRIGHT. IT WORKS GREAT LOOKS OK AND EASY TO CONTROL. GRAPHICS ARE OK AND ACTION IS OK.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This game is so fun. I use some pictures for twitter. And I use to look at. It's amazing! I love that it doesn't have any ads.
B00AWQEKIK|3.0|I was really looking forward to this boxed set when I read that Graham Nash started putting it together more than a year ago. And after all this time, I'm sorry to say that it simply was not worth the wait! My main complaint is the fact that the track selection just isn't that stellar, especially if one has the CSN boxed set and a few of Stephen Stills' solo albums already. In other words, most of the tracks have been released before and the alternate versions or unreleased stuff are just are not that interesting to my ears. And they failed to include \\"Wooden Ships,\\" his absolute masterpiece! There's also too much focus on his newer works in my opinion and his voice is really straining at this point in his career. Much like Bruce Springsteen and Ian Anderson (of Jethro Tull), it's time to admit that many years of touring have obviously taken their toll on Stills' pipes! Finally, the tracks do not seem to have been remastered. Or at least I couldn't see in the liner notes where they've been cleaned up for this 4-CD compilation.
B0084LQHN6|5.0|This album provides it's listeners with a new horizon to dwell upon.  The beats triangulate's a listeners ears and transports them to Azealea's world.  Her rhymes are not showy,she wants all of her true listeners to be on the same page on her.  This EP just makes a listener want more of Azealia.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Just what I needed to review before an important business dinner. This book is to the point and easy to browse to find just what you need. It's a good reminder of the basics for polite conversation whether for business or casual.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This story very interesting, although I had a wee bit of trouble with dialect.  The ending was a bit of surprise, except the mention. That they had same noses when they met at the hotel after answering the ad in the paper.<br /><br />Life does throw us lots of curves.
B00AO3K05S|4.0|This is a book for a sales professional that wants to re-think why is he/she doing what she/he does. Is a coming back to principles, it gives you the answer to the question: what does really matter in sales?Of course written as Daniel Pink does, easy. Many thanks for taking the effort Daniel

B0001MLMKY|5.0|I have the early/mid-80's version of this watch which has spanned my career. But I would hate to lose this workhorse for sentimental reasons. This is a terrific stand-in. It keeps great time, is as light as a feather and I would not hesitate to wear this to a ballgame or a boardroom. This is the swatch for a professional to have and use.

B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I don't claim to have the best taste in movies.  There are quite a few lousy ones that I do enjoy quite a bit.  A lot of my friends were not fans of the film but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I just don't think that there are many people that do a better job at acting than Christoph Waltz.  He brings an unmatched excitement and enthusiasm to the movies which he's in.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Fabulous deal for a recent release two-disc special edition dvd!  Arrived at my door as soon as released to public!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very good book! Filled with love and courage! It shows that o once you put your mind to something that you will never give up until you have what you want! In the end you discover it was the best decision you ever made .
B000YJ54DU|4.0|I really enjoy getting to know the different people Jack meets on his travels, he continues to inflict himself into the lives of others.

It suits the times precisely.<br />Sheryl's courage in sharing her personal experience lends credibility and power not found in most books of this genre.<br />Her realization that equality will never be given, but must be won, should inspire all of us to redouble our efforts toward that goal.<br />You can be sure each of my three granddaughters will be getting their own personal copies with high hopes and much love.<br />James Vaughan, Ph.D., Organizational Psychology
B008GZVHZI|2.0|Arrived after both my kid and myself forgot the order. Could not play on DVD since it's a different region setting. Giving some credit because the movie is still good when we played on computer.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|GREAT read. Could have been called Rationalizing Jacob. The author did a great job bringing these characters to life and getting into their heads. The character name, Logiudice, pronounced LaJudas was a great call. How far would you go to protect your child was answered in many different ways.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Great movie, and well addresses Lincoln as a person, and some of the objectionable things he had to do during presidency in a fair manner
0143120530|5.0|I was a little reluctant to pick up this book. I thought it might be just an account of techniques that could be used to memorize lists of things. Since I knew I probably wouldn't be interested in doing that, I hesitated. I'm glad I decided in favor of \\"Moonwalking\\" though. It's one of the best books I've read this year.<br /><br />Author Joshua Foer does relate some of the techniques that \\"memory champs\\" use to recall strings of numbers, long poems, people's names, etc. He briefly outlines a few of the methods that the ancient Greeks and Romans used, and that modern memory gurus such as Tony Buzan have re-packaged and presented to audiences worldwide. There is the \\"Memory Palace,\\" a place you visualize and in which you hang bizarre images that translate to numbers or names. There are ways of equating strings of numbers with letters that you then compose into words.<br /><br />But this book is so much more than an account of mnemonic techniques. It is a thoughtful, well-written discussion of the way memory shapes our perception of time, and of who we are as individuals and as humans. He gives the reasons we might all wish to exert ourselves to remember more.<br /><br />This leads into any number of fascinating topics along the way. Foer reconstructs how writing arose and how for hundreds of years it was not meant to be an external memory, but simply a way to jog our internal memories. He considers subjects such as what constitutes a \\"good\\" education. Rote memory is now anathema to progressive educators. Have they been right in adopting Dewey's philosophy of experiencing rather than knowing?<br /><br />What is it like to be totally amnesiac for anything more recent than 50 years ago? Foer does some of his best writing in describing the predicament of such a man he interviewed. The man had lost the hippocampus structures that transform short-term memory into long-term memory. Foer concludes that this man is incapable of any \\"stream of consciousness.\\" His life consistsonly of \\"droplets that evaporate.\\" He lives in a narrow spotlight, with darkness all around.<br /><br />Then Foer relates some of the characteristics of super-rememberers such as \\"Rainman\\" Kim Peek, one of the few people who seemed able to remember everything he read or encountered without notable use of standard mnemonic techniques. Foer contrasts this with the minds of the memory champs who befriended him in order to coach him to enter the U.S. and then the World Memory Championships.<br /><br />Foer covers a lot of ground in a readable, always entertaining way. The only major memory oddity he seems to have missed making mention of is that characterized by a few people, such as actress Marilu Henner, who have been featured in the news in recent years. These rarities have shown an ability to remember the headline events of any date you might rattle off to them - and to remember features of what they did that day - what they ate and what they wore. It would have been interesting if Foer had interviewed Henner or one of her kind, to find out if they just remember highlighted aspects of each day, or if they remember EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Then you might be interested in viewing the movie [[ASIN:B002B3ATBE Desk Set]] as a companion piece to this book. Katharine Hepburn plays a network researcher who is thrown up against the capabilities of a computer. In the course of proving the superiority of her mind over matter to Spencer Tracy, she smartly demonstrates some of the mnemonic techniques mentioned in \\"Moonwalking.\\"
B009VIZDLI|5.0|beautiful simple a great read right from the start..  sweet and has some nice insight into the life of a bright man trying to connect and find a wife
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I bought this CD after I saw a show on TV about how Simon went to Africa and found the folks he made the CD with. Was interesting. So I had to purchase this to really listen to it again.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|its a good read.... not rubbish but not great..  probably better than the usual..  gave a good picture of the time and place..
0199267170|4.0|I fell for the Oxford edition and like the speaker of the Sonnets relative to the Dark Lady, I was blind to its defects too long.<br /><br />I bought two copies in 2005 when I was \\"rich\\" owing to the financial boom: the paperback for my teaching to be used in class, and the hardbound for my home study. I could see how relatively flimsy they are, for Oxford has long compensated for the flimsiness of its books with the prestige of its name, and the genuine scholarship it's put into editing. Oxford offered successively higher priced editions of its standards at the turn of the last century, from a flimsy blue buckram with India (very thin) paper to higher-priced editions in \\"Moroccan\\" leather, sporting gold leaf and more durable paper.<br /><br />Sure enough, the paperback King Lear disintegrated after being repeatedly copied and passed around, but not so much that I wasn't able to rescue the text of each play and staple it into a separate, handy little \\"Quarto\\" suitable for copying under \\"fair use\\" for students, and as an actor's prompt book.<br /><br />But while the hardbound endured at my home, I am now re-reading all of Shakespeare having read his complete works in 1962 as a lad of 12. I have Stage IV/D1 prostate cancer and the opportunity to live in a hospice style facility awaiting results from chemotherapy, and re-read Shakespeare in the light of modern scholarship, notably, the two versions of Lear (1608 in Quarto, 1623 in the Folio).<br /><br />This has exposed the relative and understandable flimsiness of the hardbound. It was made to be taken from the shelf and read at the desk. It can survive a Churchill chuckling and dozing over Falstaff and Timon of Athens in an easy chair with a cigar and whisky soda.<br /><br />But in a hospital room while I have my lunch is problematic for the book is being deformed past the limits set by its binders as it is distended in my bed, and I find that even small drops of food can remove the print from the opposite page when the pages are separated (I have no data as to the sticking-together action of another substance called \\"baby batter\\" but I imagine it isn't good.)<br /><br />Another problem is what I consider the \\"vanity\\", or perhaps self-filfilling, admission of a new play, Edward III, which may include passages by Shakespeare, but in which S, perhaps burned out at the time of Edward III on \\"history\\" plays, and not noted in what we know as exceptionally willing to put his nose to the grindstone, simply did not take an interest in the architecture of this history play.<br /><br />All the other history plays except for in part King John, Richard II and All Is True (Henry VIII), that is, the \\"core\\" plays from Henry IV Part 1 to Richard III, are layered pictures of England in the 15th century. In the \\"Henrician trilogy\\" S cannot resist all sorts of clever scenes, such as the Cade rebellion, Pucelle's nonsense, and Talbot v Mad Duchess and Crazed Dwarf.<br /><br />This is under better control in Richard III but only because the main character was an unusually dastardly person and therefore, given audience's eternal fascination with dastardly individuals, Richard can fill out the play in a way the non-dastardly Edward II could not. When Edward III goes at the Countess of Salisbury with wicked intent, the audience cheers him on, for wicked intent is theatrical, allowing the audience vicarious Thrills. But when Edward III stands down, wishing to be a virtuous ruler, we approve of this while stifling a yawn.<br /><br />This is just a mediaeval miniature snookered from Froissart. I fear that even at the zenith of their profession there was pressure - whether internal or external I don't know, to \\"discover\\" Edward III as a \\"Shakespeare\\" play even though it has lain, like Poe's Purloined Letter, in plain view for many years.<br /><br />Missing, or pressured out of Wells and Taylor in academic science worship of atomic facts, and a concomitant over-rating of details. A \\"Shakespeare\\" play  \\"must\\" contain the diversity of incident and depth of characterization we associate with Shakespeare otherwise it \\"must\\" by critical consensus anyway, be relegated with the numerous times we know Shakespeare was a \\"script doctor\\", always ready to help stuck authors with a script.<br /><br />Edward III is archtecturally tight as a drum but its chivalric military ethic is unrelieved by Shakespeare's questioning, thru Hotspur's psychotic exaggeration of the chivalric ideal (plucking bright honor out of the sea by her locks, etc.) thru its very absurdity and the effect it has on his wife. Or, for that matter, by Falstaff's speech on \\"Honour\\", Shakespeare's and Falstaff's obvious disgust with Prince John's dishonorable if bloodless victory in Henry IV Part 2.

B00AIUUXHC|1.0|Was trying to figure out why in the world this game resets itself. At first I thought my kids was doing something to my kindle cause they were playing it first and complained that it reset by itself. But then I got into the game and started playing myself.   Got into it and loved it but right when I saved up enough coins to get the Great White it completely reset me back to the beginning. I had to come on this website and read the reviews to realize I wasn't the only 1 having this problem smh bulls*** dont make no sense and I bought the stupid 50% coins multiplier for 2.99.  Hell I want my money back if this is what it does. And I keep my WiFi turned off so it had to be something with the game itself. This ain't no damn antivirus issue.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was very hard to put down and a big tear jerker. I would recommend  this book to anyone who wants a good read! The story is awesome and gives you a different perspective on animals.
B001DM1VXE|5.0|Finally, an unexpected gem just at the right time. Calmed my restless quest to avoid the repetitive and ordinary channel flicking nothingness experience. Amazing that I watched, hesitated, watched some more and then actually sat down to get into it. Shut down the Kindle Fire HD and watched on the big screen. In black and white yet. This movie was mostly about Max a mathematician and his mentor. First Max had to establish that there were in fact patterns, that the world was not random and meaningless, then he had to establish that there was an underlying law to -all- patterns, even the man made stock market. When he predicted the exact numbers of two stocks in a downward spiraling market, he knew he was very close. The pain of obsession and discovery was enhanced by the high contrast, stark black and white film and by Max moving in and out of \\"surreality\\". (Felt like an old film, thinking of Fritz Lang?) Like all great minds, he was being watched by others who wanted what they thought he was about to discover for political power and religious purposes. (The underlying law in Maxs formula was looking like the mystical Hassidic mathematics that underly the name of G-d and they wanted to be involved in Maxs discovery) Lets just say at this point that the movie shows that a one sided analytic mind obsessed with knowing in only this way can lead to madness and death. Better to step back a bit and open your heart and eyes and ears. To see the clouds and sky and hear the birds and not know the answer to the the young girls mathematical question. And I say does it have to be one or the other? Terrific film. Well done.

0061950726|3.0|[[ASIN:0061950726 Orphan Train: A Novel]] is a touching novel with a common formula: an older isolated protagonist takes a young outcast under her wing.  This unlikely friendship provides a second chance to each character, and allows each of them to learn more about who they are.<br /><br />Molly Ayer is the younger character who is taken on to help Vivian sort through an attic full of momentos.  She is a young girl of Native American descent who has been knocked around the foster care system. She takes on the job at Vivian's to fulfill a community service obligation.  But she gains so much more than what she thought she would through the experience.<br /><br />Vivian is living out the twilight of her years in Maine, but as a young Irish orphan, Vivian was put on a train from NYC to the Midwest.  There is a historical basis to this story.  From the 1850s through the 1920s, orphan trains really did take kids from the East Coast to the farmlands.  Some were lucky and found good homes, but many were sent to a fate akin to slavery or indentured servitude.<br /><br />The sections written in Vivian's voice are mostly set in depression-era Minnesota.  Despite her heart-rending story, I found Vivian's plight to be fascinating.<br /><br />But the present day parts told from Molly's perspective were less compelling.  The author just seemed to have a better sense of Vivian's narrative voice.  Molly's character felt forced at times, with the author going to great lengths to try to portray her teenage angst.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This is a good book, and it is likely to find an audience.  But since the story is told from the perspective of these two characters, at times it becomes disjointed and almost reads like two separate novels.  Both perspectives are interesting and this book is a good read.  But it just isn't as cohesive as it could have been.  Nevertheless, this is recommended to anybody who has an interest in learning more about orphan trains.  And those who love coming of age novels will also likely enjoy this.love coming of age novels will also likely enjoy this.
B00C9VFWP6|5.0|Stu Block has managed to do what I thought was impossible - do justice to material from Iced Earth's full discography, and originally sung by no less than 4 different people. He can out-scream Ripper, and even out-emote Harlow. And the whole band sounds tight, energized, and the crowd is INTO it. That a band this far into their career can pull off a live album like this is really remarkable.<br /><br />If you like Iced Earth - old stuff or new - this is a must buy. And if you like power metal at all - grab it.<br /><br />Now I just have to wait for the Blu-ray to come out in the U.S.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|i agree with  90% of everyone else, it wasnt like the other ones it was  shorter, way more sub titles, few scenes could of been better,  yet like the last one a lot  of car pile ups and things blowing up, left and right  ketp my attention but i liked his daughter's story more than his sons and again it was like  35 minute shorter compared to the other  4 He made a comment \\"your mom worried and feared you were doing  drugs, his mother face hasnt been seen since part s 2 and a few tiem in part  3 he suppsoedly argue over phone with her,  so is she  ever goign to seena gain? there was a interview a month ago where bruice said he pictures himself doing one more so i wonder if it hima nd his wife or something. all in all other than the sub titles trying to keep up with, and  wishing it was a tad bit longer it had  decent acftion glad i seen it in a locla  $1 theater where they go when no longer popular i'll sitll probablya dd it to the sereis.  Good action scenes, ifyou dotn mind sub titles more than the others, no movie of year material, yet decent entertainment.  IF he did not claim to b john mclain and callthis a die hard 5 part of this to me could of past for like an expendable movie for exampel ther was  3  x men then they made oen about wolverine,, there was  2 expendables brucie was in both this could of passed as his expendable charecter on his own mission if they dint callthis die hard 5 ifyou ask me just my opinion<br />enjoy it if you liek action and hope the subtitles (about  25-30% of movie was subtiteld) that wast bugge met he most but enjoy the decent  93 minute action compared to allth other  2hr-2hr 10 minutes in the other 4

B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|So far my second favorite album of the year (behind Silverstein) about an hour of music, with quite a few great tracks, (Pearl Hart , Lola Montez, the single -The Hangman's Body count) numerous good songs, and no bad songs.<br />This LP's theme is portrayed quite well and does not seems forced at all, the album seems like a story album but its hard to tell with his accent on 50% of his words. Regardless, you won't find anyone on the planet or in history with the sound these guys have, truly a one of a kind band with what might be their best release to date (\\"Above Heaven / Beyond Hell\\" or This) A great album and well worth it to pick up.<br /><br />EDIT: Hell or Highwater - Begin Again... has passed this album as my second favorite of the year, this album is currently 3rd

B0029EDMEG|4.0|A good movie...but the part with alot women throwing themselves at him is a bit of a stretch. I mean the plot and Selleck and the crime part of it are good.  But every single woman he comes across aggressively throws herself at him.  I mean a hot 19 year  old college chick in a bar making sexual advances on a 50 something or late 40s something year old guy????  No..... college chicks are interested in college boys and would be super intimidated by a  guy that much older.<br />  Then...the girl he dates brings up sex on the first date...sex with him. Then, at a dinner party...some other guys wife pulls him on the dance floor and propositions sex with him.  All he has to do is be there.  This is so unrealistic.  Not human nature at all.....men are always the aggressors and women are more demure needing to be seduced. At least the female vet didn't try to throw him on the examining table and rip his clothes off.<br />  Other than this beef....it is good writing with good actors.  I will watch more Jesse Stone films.

B00B8XC2O0|4.0|J.J. Cale's five-disc box set, \\"Classic Album Selection\\" has been released via Mercury Records. The blurb tells you that this box set comes \\"in mini-LP paper sleeves, housed in an deluxe slipcase\\". What this mean means in English is that it comes in a stout cardboard casing with five card encased CDs. On this site the info claims \\"a new 2013 remastered collection of 5 classic studio albums\\" although the set bears no documentary support for this and in any case Cale's albums always sounded great. If any reader has any further information on where the \\"remastering\\" took place a comment below would be much appreciated. The box set includes five of Cale's classic albums: Naturally (1972), Troubadour (1976), Shades (1981), Grasshopper (1982) and #8 (1983). This by any standards is a very puzzling approach to choosing Cale's output for presentation. It lacks in chronology and begs the question why these five albums? Irritatingly it misses such classics as 1974s \\"Okie\\" easily one of his best albums (and thus no \\"Cajun Moon\\" or \\"I've got the same old blues\\") plus the excellent \\"Really\\" (1972). Similarly if Cale's 1979s album \\"5\\" had been added this would have grouped his first eight Mercury albums and surely not added much to the price bearing in mind that the Rhino 10 set box of Joni Mitchell's output from 1968 to 1979 came in cheaper per album. Frustrating is not the word for all this since it is hard to fathom the justifications for these arbitrary omissions which mean that the concept behind the set barely justifies 3 Stars.<br /><br />If on the other hand this is your introduction to the great man's music the songs on these five records speak for themselves with clarity and will introduce a sly old groove so contagious that you will need musical inoculation to free yourself from its vice like grip. Let us dispense immediately with the obligatory Eric Clapton and Dire Straits references and state emphatically that John Weldon Cale is a true original and needs neither of the former artists to define his or categorize music. Indeed if forced with a choice this reviewer would happily take the single instance of prime Cale his debut \\"Naturally\\" over the collected output of Eric Clapton since the demise of Derek and the Dominoes and some of the later bluster produced by Knopfler and Co. So then onto the music of Oklahoma's favourite son J.J. Cale -<br /><br />NATURALLY (1972) - A great debut album starting with the song immortalized by Lynyrd Skynyrd \\"Call me the breeze\\". It is a Cale manifesto so economical, laid-back and effortless with first class honours degree guitar picking and lyrics, which define the freedom of the great highway. It is easily matched by other highlights including the moody swamp blues of \\"Don't go to strangers\\" with a brilliant Cale vocal; wipe that tear from your eye with one of his best ballads \\"Magnolia\\" and recognise that the definitive version of \\"After Midnight: is to be located here. That said the standout out track on an album of stellar highlights is the pure country funk of the stunning \\"River runs deep\\"<br /><br />TROUBADOUR (1976) - A superb album which sees Cale's songs start to creep over the 3 minute mark and includes one that lasts over four! The album most famous track is the Cale signature tune \\"Cocaine\\" although even better is the great live favourite \\"Ride me high\\" which shows that Cale's only comparable rootsy white funk musical equivalent was the late lamented Lowell George. Seek out also the fabulous jazzy blues of \\"Hold on\\" and what amounts to a Cale hard rock song the pounding \\"I'm a gypsy man\\". Finally what can you say about \\"Travellin Light\\" with its great guitar work and hypnotic percussion? Granted there is a very good rocking Clapton cover on \\"Reptile\\" but the masters' version of this great song is unsurpassable and should be sought out by any Cale \\"virgins\\" as an immediate download.<br /><br />SHADES (1981) - For some this is viewed as a merely good Cale album as opposed to his usual meticulous standard. \\"Shades\\" is interesting for its more blues based approach to songwriting and for a little extra polish in the production. Repeated listens however reveal a little gem not least in the joy of the wistful \\"Wish I Had Not Said That\\", the rolling cover that is \\"Mama don't\\" and for those who want to know where the inspiration for Mark Knopfler's guitar style comes from should go no further than the superb opener \\"Carry on\\" which he later used to underpin his song \\"Border Reiver\\". Note also the present of two five minute plus instrumental songs the laidback blues of \\"Play my jack\\" a J.J. Cale master class in playing and the bluesy interplay of guitar and saxophone on \\"Cloudy Day\\"<br /><br />GRASSHOPPER (1982) - This is Cale settling down to his later groove with the ever so slightly Ry Cooder sounding \\"City Girls\\" and a real standout track and perennial favourite \\"Devil in disguise\\". Sadly it also contains this reviewers least favourite Cale songs the rather silly \\"Does your Mama like to reggae\\" which has 1980s mistake written all over it, equally the instrumental \\"Dr Jive\\" is throwaway stuff. Luckily the good dramatically outweighs the bad not least the porch acoustic picking of \\"Drifters wife\\" and the social comment of \\"Downtown LA\\" which almost cross-fertilizes across the Atlantic with Knopfler's \\"Down to the Waterline\\". While the he lovely piano ballad \\"You keep me hanging on\\" is a bit of a departure from the usual Cale guitar format its excellent all the same.<br /><br />#8 (1983) - There are parts of this album that lack the sparkle of earlier releases and sounds like Cale by numbers. In fact this is Cale's Reagan era social commentary album and in one sense was repeated for the Bush era by Ry Cooder in 2011's \\"Pull up some dust and sit down\\". The picture of Cale on the cover tells the story of album, which is one of the darkest and bleakest albums he has recorded. Song titles like \\"Loser\\", \\"People lie\\", \\"Unemployment\\" and the great duet with Christine Lakeland on \\"Money talks\\" create a mood of a Cale protest album. It is well worth a listen but not a completely essential part of the Cale canon of work. Interestingly he took a six-year recording hiatus after this album and probably avoided any danger (however slight0 of recording one of those horribly 1980s over produced high tech cursed high-end treble monstrosities.<br /><br />One reviewer has argued that \\"Cale is so objectively consistent that differences between albums in the long run boil down to which of the songs affect you on all days of the month and which of them affect you only on odd ones'. This is true but at the same time as the comments above show do not gain the impression that Cale's albums are a line of straight continuity without variance. The differences are subtle but they are differences all the same. J.J Cale remains one of the best recording artists of the past 40 plus years and all his albums either yield class and quality in parts or in an embarrassing abundance. The fact that he is probably best known from covers of his music by other musicians is something that sadly looks unlikely to change at this point in his long career. If this is to be the case treat him has your secret pleasure, with songs for every occasion and a nod tipped to the musical gods for placing one of their favourite sons amongst the midst of mere mortals.<br /><br />Postscript.

B005X5XIL0|4.0|Andrea puts on a really good show. I do not have a dvd that he doesn't. there are a couple of dvds that I have by him that I like better, but this one is good too..
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|I finally  brought it home yesterday and pretty much put it on right away.  I went through about half the album and the only word I can use to describe what I thought of it is, \\"baffled\\".  I didn't know whether or not I liked it but I certainly didn't LOVE it.<br /><br />Then, on a whim, I decided to take it with me in the car and give it a \\"fresh\\" listen.  I don't quite know what happened but, my friends, within the first thirty seconds of the opening track I found myself shaking my head and thinking, \\"holy crap...this is GOOD\\".  Song after song it was the same thing.  These songs have so much going on in them that, at first, it's hard to really make sense of them melodically.<br /><br />I continued with it later, on the way home from work, and just now on the way back from my father-in-law's.<br /><br />This is an incredible album.  One song after the next..between melodic content and those Bowie-like rhythmic patterns...<br /><br />I never got Heathen from the nineties so the last Bowie album I ever got was \\"Tonight\\" from the mid-eighties-it contained  Blue Jean, should any of  you remember it.  I thought the album sucked as did Let's Dance before it..so, for me, it was pretty much over with Bowie with the end of the seventies which was the Scary Monsters album.<br /><br />That said, the last REALLY good Bowie album I'm familiar with (I actually have them all from Hunky Dory to Scary Monsters) is, in my opinion, Heroes.  And, coincidentally (speaking in terms of the cover), THIS album is the best thing he's done SINCE Heroes.  I'm looking very forward to hearing the rest of it and then going back to hear it all over again-it's got so much going on in it that it warrants MULTIPLE INTRODUCTORY listens.<br /><br />THIS is the Bowie I basically grew up with in the seventies.  Songwriting of melodic substance enveloped in creative arrangements that leave you in continuous anticipation from one track to the next.<br /><br />As most are saying, definitely worth the wait.

I am a huge fan of Hannibal and movies alike and when Kevin Bacon was starring in the new TV show The Following, I was very interested in this genre, however The Following quickly disappointed after episode 3, funny that I am still watching The Following week after week hoping for an improvement that is not yet there.<br />When Hannibal aired I thought with caution that history could repeat, but so far it is a very good show.<br />However there are several production errors which do not add up, this is supposed to be the story of Dr. Hannibal BEFORE the first Hannibal movie, so that said, can someone please explain to me why a brand new Ipad appears on episode 2 in Dr. Hannibals hands? And also a Macbook air suddenly pops up in a desk? Is Hannibal a very early adopter of Apple products? Maybe a VIP Alpha tester of their technology?<br />There are other production errors as well, even cars,  accesories and clothing do not match the era.<br />Hannibal is a lover of life`s finest things so his taste for clothes, cars,  accesories,  technology,  etc  should reflect the era and time which the character is portraing.<br />All in all, I recommend this show and lets hope that history does nor repeat itself like with The Following.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|Marvel Comics' demonic biker returns in this thrilling sequel. This time, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) finds himself the reluctant guardian of a young boy named Danny (Fergus Riordan)--who also happens to be the devil's son. If Johnny uses the power of Ghost Rider to keep Danny from being used as part of his father's plot to rule the world, he may be able to rid himself of his flame-headed alter ego once and for all. Great Movie and the price is right. Not a waste of time.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|Based on the novel &#34;These Foolish Things&#34; by Deborah Moggach, this upbeat comedy/drama follows seven British senior citizens to Jaipur, India, where they plan to spend their retirement years in the beautiful-sounding Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. But even as the hotel proves to be somewhat less extravagant than promised, its new residents slowly begin to appreciate their surroundings, often in unexpected ways. A bunch of senior actors come together for this film and they do, do it justice. Loved this film.

When this &#34;safe house&#34; proves to be anything but, and hired assassins make an attempt on the prisoner's life, rookie Reynolds must take Washington on the run--with danger lurking around every corner.

006114665X|5.0|As the one-hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of World War I approaches we have seen many new books analyzing the reasons why conflict broke out in the summer of 1914.  Christopher Clark's The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went To War In 1914, is certain to be ranked among the very best of these.  Clark takes the muddied waters and tangled threads of the multiple players in the tragedy and clarifies them in a series of thorough, heavily documented, and extremely well written chapters.<br /><br />Clark begins with a now largely forgotten coup: the overthrow and murder of the King and Queen of Serbia and the installation of a new King and dynasty in 1903.  This is appropriate, because that event set Serbia on the road toward territorial aggrandizement and closer Russian ties. This in turn weakened the Ottoman Empire, destabilized the Balkans, and led Russia and Austria-Hungary into one confrontation after another.  Those confrontations inevitably led to Germany, France, and Great Britain becoming much more heavily invested in Balkan disputes than they had ever intended to be and increased the over all tension level throughout Europe.<br /><br />Clark then turns to a closer examination of the diplomatic situation in Europe during the last twenty five years or so before 1914.  He traces the polarization of Europe as Germany and Britain's formerly warm relations began to cool, France and Russia forged an unlikely alliance, and the growing weakness of the Ottoman Empire caused European countries like Italy, Russia, and Austria-Hungary to seek new territories and concessions.  Throughout this section Clark emphasizes that there were a number of universal and dangerous misconceptions: that one's own nation was gradually getting weaker and needed to go to war while it still had a chance to win, or that a nation's enemies were secretly working together to gain critical advantages, or that Russia was far more powerful than she actually was.  Clark has a good eye for an illuminating anecdote, such as the ones detailing the weakness of the Austrian Minister Conrad von Hotzendorf for a pretty lady. There are also some eerie echoes of our own time, such as Serbian \\"ethnic cleansing\\" or Italian air strikes on Libya.<br /><br />The last segment deals with the actual crisis that led to war in 1914, beginning with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his morganatic wife at Sarajevo.  Here the reader is struck by the tragic coincidences that over and over again seemed to work to make war more likely: the distraction of the French press and public by a sensational trial involving senior government officials, or the inopportune state visit of France's President to the Tsar of Russia, or the way diplomats and generals kept making dangerous and thoughtless maneuvers as if they were of no more consequence than moves on a chess board.  Eventually, without anyone really meaning to do it, what had been a little local affair exploded into a continent wide war, leaving many leaders shaking their heads and wondering how it had all happened.<br /><br />The world today is far more dangerous than it was in 1914, and it is important that books like this, with ample warnings for us of the hazards of brinksmanship, extreme nationalism, hubris, and lack of imagination. President John F. Kennedy famously kept Barbara Tuchman's The Guns of August on his desk in the Oval Office as a reminder of how quickly events can spiral out of control.  I think The Sleepwalkers deserves just as much respect today.ing anecdote, such as the ones detailing the weakness of the Austrian Minister Conrad von Hotzendorf for a pretty lady.

B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Death Dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is back--again dressed in skintight black--for this fourth installment of the popular horror/action series, as humanity goes to war against both the vampire and werewolf clans. Escaping from the corporation that has held her captive in cryogenic freeze for experimentation, the vampiric heroine proceeds to do sexy battle with her adversaries, with an assist coming from a cop (Michael Ealy) on her side. Great action movie, and the price was right.

B005F3XV62|5.0|In this wacky comedy, Kevin James plays Griffin Keyes, a zookeeper who loves animals who love him back! In appreciation of their keeper's devotion to their well-being, a gorilla (voiced by Nick Nolte), a monkey (voiced by Adam Sandler), a lioness (voiced by Cher), and others suddenly start speaking up to help engineer a romance between Griffin and a pretty colleague (Rosario Dawson). Leslie Bibb, Donnie Wahlberg co-star. Loved this movie. Great buy for the money.
B00B47NO2O|2.0|I really like the TV show \\"Dark Minds.\\"  It's one of those rare shows that I really look forward to the next episode, kind of like \\"The X Files\\" a long time ago, at least before that show went off the rails in its last couple of seasons.  I really like the interplay between M. William Phelps and John Kelly; I always get a really good chuckle when 13, or Raven, makes some mysterious comment and either the author or profiler looks up at the other in dismay.<br /><br />I just read part of a review, written by Raven, of the show \\"The Following.\\"  Now, for those of you who haven't seen \\"Dark Minds,\\" Raven is the pseudonym of the real-life serial killer who helps Mr. Phelps and Mr. Kelly during profiling sessions.  Raven is now behind bars, but he is allowed 15 minutes a call, to give an opinion on some unsolved crime.  Now, if anyone knows what he's talking about when it comes to serial killers, it would be Raven.  After all, practice makes perfect.  And evidently, he's had a lot of practice.  And I was very happy to see that Raven hates \\"The Following\\" nearly as much as I.<br /><br />I watched the first episode of \\"The Following\\" and only made it through the first half.  Raven turned it off after 40 minutes.  To me, the biggest problem with this façade-of-a-serial-killer-show:  everyone is in constant crisis mode.  The real world doesn't work this way.  People have down time; they drink coffee every once in a while!  But watching Kevin Bacon -- and his coworkers here -- you'd think they're all on speed.  Man, I say:  kick it down a notch every once in a while!  There are other issues, but this issue alone is sufficient to make me change the channel.<br /><br />One issue that I had with Raven's analysis:  he said that serial killers don't engage the police.  Now, that is usually the case; most serial killers are smart enough to avoid attention.  However, what about killers such as Zodiac?  He is one of quite a few that seemed to enjoy toying with the police.  But otherwise, I liked Ravens critique of \\"The Following,\\" a show that I won't be following at all, just like Raven.<br /><br />But I will be following \\"Dark Minds.\\"  I guess the season ends this week.  Bummer.  Well, I can watch one more show and then I'll have to wait until fall for the next episode.  I'd recommend following \\"Dark Minds,\\" and dumping \\"The Following\\" from your queue.  You won't be following unwatchable TV that way.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law return as Holmes and Watson in director Guy Ritchie's exciting sequel. A string of seemingly random and unrelated assassinations across the globe leads the daring detective and his trusty companion on a dangerous adventure that finds Holmes matching wits with his most cunning foe, Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris), who plots to orchestrate a world war for his own personal gain. Great movie and a great buy. Well worth the time and money.
B00BMIVKJE|2.0|Must say it's a major disappointment though. Gone is the edge in every aspect on the album.<br />My own personal opinion...the album is an ongoing journey of ballad-based, melancholic material that I never expected to hear on an entire CD.<br />After 28 years of being a Sarah Brightman fan, this is a kick in the head.<br /><br />When I obtained the new music, my excitement was brief, for the album bored and depressed me.<br />Upon first listen, I could only bear to skim through a few seconds of each track rather than playing the album from start to finish.<br />Then, after playing the whole album 2 or 3 times, I actually said out loud \\"What the heck is going on? Is this the beginning of the end for her?\\"<br /><br />Everything is so saccharine, it makes me want to barf!<br />I did upload the album twice on my iphone but removed it both times.<br /><br />Gone is the edge and sass which came with all Sarah's last pop CDs. Wow, far from that breath-taking journey the \\"Eden\\" and \\"Fly\\" CDs took us on, huh?<br />The only upbeat song is a cover of Elbow's \\"One Day Like This\\". This one is way too puzzling.<br />Who the heck is Elbow anyway? I never heard of them before listening to Sarah's version of it.<br />It's obviously not a new song and was written before I was born. Find the error. Is there nothing else to come up with than digging through an inventory of music from the 60's and 70's?<br /><br />Speaking of cover tunes.......Yeah, once again, Dreamchaser is full of cover tunes. Considering she's capable of writing her own music and appealing to today's market, she still continues taking other people's music and re-arranging it suitable for her albums.<br />Due to my disappointment, I'm NOT going to attend the Dreamchaser World Tour when Sarah comes to Montreal this September.<br /><br />I'm not impressed with her high-pitched, saccharine little girl voice.<br />Too much processing was done on the album, with a metallic flange and a very wet sound.<br />Gone is the powerful edge and the emotion in both the music and singing which drew me so deeply into her albums on the EastWest and Angel labels.<br />Was this her decision or the decision of Sally Herbert and Mike Hedges (her new producers)?<br />Frank Peterson is gone, whom by far, played a major role in the awesome sound on her albums.<br /><br />Ok sure, Sarah can follow a childhood dream of hers. Doesn't mean Dreamchaser had to end up one continous journey without a good balance between songs.<br />As for the song selection, well, I held my breath in hope that \\"Lento E Largo\\" (The one and only Operatic Piece) would be the best track on the album but to my dismay, it's one of the worst. Sarah's voice is thin and strained, which cannot compare with the voice of Dawn Upshaw on her version of the same piece.<br /><br />\\"A Song of India\\" is downright awful. Sarah's wet, layered vocalizing on this song gives the impression she's a wailing banshee.<br />Canadian Comedy/Opera/Classical singer Natalie Choquette does a breath-taking version of it both live and in the studio.<br />The song is supposed to be light and dreamy and powerful at the same time.<br /><br />Perhaps it's finally time to sever the ties I had as a fan over the past 28 years.<br />I don't believe the Dreamchaser show will do any justice to the music on the CD.<br />This played a dominant role in my decision to sit this tour out.<br />I'll put my money toward more important things. Afterall, there will probably be a DVD of this tour anyway.<br />I wasn't really impressed with the Symphony World Tour when she came to Montreal. Sarah's voice was already strained and tired at that show.<br /><br />The photos in the booklet are.....well...what am I supposed to say? Sarah is beautiful at 53 years of age. Thanks to Photoshop and her stylist.<br />She knows exactly how to market herself in this day and age. With a body like hers, who wouldn't?<br />The picture on the non-playing side of the CD is kinda weird.<br />It should've been just a plain white disc with silver lettering.<br />When it came to Sarah's commercial releases (Since \\"DIVE\\"), not much bothered me up until listening to Dreamchaser.<br />Diehard fans will love this album. I have it because as part of my collection, but among the bottom 3 albums've been just a plain white disc with silver lettering.<br />When it came to Sarah's commercial releases (Since \\"DIVE\\"), not much bothered me up until listening to Dreamchaser.<br />Diehard fans will love this album. I have it because as part of my collection, but among the bottom 3 albums

It's a world on the brink of collapse, and Carter rediscovers his humanity when he realizes the survival of Barsoom and its people rests in his hands. Stunning special effects, great characters and villains. This got low ratings, thou I don't know why. I enjoyed it. Disney always seems to do a great job.

With Stellan Skarsgard, Clark Gregg, and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. Good action and acting. Worth the money and time to watch. I will watch it again.
B000000OUE|5.0|both Portrait of an American Family/Smells like Children and Astrocreep 2000 came out around the same time, so it doesn't surprise me.<br /><br />Revisting this album 18 years later actually helps me see the similarities that the three share musically and thematically.

Once back in the States, fate brings him to her doorstep. A great watch, It is a movie some of the guys may not like to watch but i guess I am the exception. I am a romantic at heart.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|The Heist is an excellent example of what Hip Hop should be.  Ryan Lewis lays down excellent music to back up the witty and well thought out lyrics.  Instead of following the current hip hop album norm of making the artist into some larger than life figure that's clearly a fraud, Macklemore takes the road less traveled.  He talks about his recovery from addiction, his relapse, poignant social commentary (Thrift Shop, Neon Cathedral, Wing$), and even takes on a subject Hip Hop runs from (screaming bloody murder), gay marriage (Same Love).  I spent days listening to just this album and never grew tired of it.  Even if you're not a big fan of hip hop, I strongly suggest at least seeking out these songs on youtube, pandora, or (gasp!) the radio.
B00000G3PL|5.0|I love the Lethal weapon series, upon seeing the price of this, it made this a must buy for me. Great value. An the action is awsome.

Since You have to pay for return postage and deal with packaging it up and taking it to the post office it is not worth my time to follow the return procedure.

B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for Destruction has been one of my favorite albums for 25 years, I remember hearing the songs back when I was 13 years and now as an adult I can still listen and appreciate just the same. It's simply blew everything out of the water at the time. Welcome to the Jungle, my favorite song, it's the ultimate in teenage aggression and it's a dark tale about the city I grew up in. From start to finish, there is no filler and all of the songs are great, Sweet Child Mine, Paradise City and Rocket Queen are simply rock classics and everything else is a just notch bellow it. I am sad when I hear new music because nothing has the rawness and power that good old time hard rock has.

0307720748|5.0|What a fun and crazy guy.  I could only wish to be as adventurous and entrepeneurial as Richard.  You learn the importance of chasing your passion and taking calculated risks.  You won't want to put it down although you will because it's long, but worth it.  I'll read this again.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The good: this is a well-written, very clever, utterly absorbing read. I truly couldn't put it down, and was up until 2 a.m. reading, with my attention engrossed pretty much the whole time.<br /><br />The bad:  SPOILER ALERT....<br /><br />Really? is this the 1990s???? The \\"psycho bitch\\" trope should be safely dead by now. This was Fatal Attraction on steroids. I'm so goddamn tired of writers creating female characters like this.<br /><br />Plus, the plot holes were pretty enormous. The police were super-sharp at picking up little lies Nick told, but no one bothered to check Amy's story out??????? No one checked where Desi was on the day he supposedly kidnapped her? A gynecologist couldn't tell she'd never actually been pregnant? They couldn't tell her forearm wound was self-inflicted? And Nick STAYED IN THE HOUSE WITH HER after her return????? Blergh.

They are not trying to repeat themselves, they are doing something different. You won`t hear anything like this album . This is 100% FOB. But FOB from 2013.
B0064MGU98|4.0|The story premise is simple yet the drama and characters develop into complex pattern that keep the interest of the viewer. Fun story line to follow.

B009G8GRX6|5.0|I listen to music all the time. I was burned out on all my music and wishing for something new to come along. I found Muse. I have not stopped listening to this album!! My musical taste is eclectic. I listen to everything from Toby Keith, to Skrillex, to Modest Mouse to Blackalicious to Johnny Cash. Honestly, all songs on this album are great and very enjoyable to listen to. Sounds best in good earphones with a committed listener, not so great as background music.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A wonderful story of heartbreak and triumph over life's twists and turns. Beautiful scenery and frightening imagery both came to life so fluidly.
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|I remember not hearing that much about this movie when it first came out, I guess that should have been my first clue. Delivery was fine, DVD was in good shape.  It was just the movie that wasn't that good.<br /><br />Barbara Sargent

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I need to start out by saying that this book was awesome! It had everything that I love about a book. I have seen some of the other reviews that have been left and I wonder how this book can get a rating of less than 4 stars.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Have 3 kindle fires that this game is on. The game was downloaded on them for my kids. The game worked just fine until it ran the update, now we can't even get it to load. We really loved the game and are very disappointed that we can no longer play it. I have removed it o the kindles and reloaded them back on and it still does the same thing.
B006IDG2T6|3.0|Sam Harris makes a strong point in his book, which can basically be burned down to \\"We don't have free will because we don't know why we want chocolate vs vanilla ice cream on a particular day\\". And he stays on subject, hitting it from a sides before ending the book.  However, its just a singular case he is making on a subject that has a lot of depth to it.  At the end, I found myself very much wanting.  There are so many directions to go from here.  He is just touching on a subject which extends to the holographic universe concept.  I would like to see this be a lot more fleshed out.<br /><br />Other than that, its a good read.  Sam has an iron grasp on the subject.  I'd just like to hear more.
0345543971|5.0|This book is great! I highly recommend for any fan of fantasy! The book does a good job of capturing the reader. Before you know it, you'll be done with this hefty novel.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Doesn't work at all with Fire HD. Everything gives error message.  Terrible pics. Glad only 99¢ so deleted app already.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I recently gave the original DVDs away to a friend who *gasp* had never seen the series. He liked it so much I told him to keep it and I would just get it on Blu-ray. Plays good. Nice sharp image and sound as one would expect from Blu-ray. My only complaint is the menu load times. I've clocked them at about 2 min to load the initial menu. I also pretty much hate the menu navigation. However, I do not see those two issues as being anything that gets in the way of the content.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I had purchased a 3 C-Cell flashlight and needed a holster for it.  I found this one on amazon and read a few reviews and for the price, I tried it.  I found that at first it was tight getting the light to fit in the holster but with some use, it has streched to fit snugly.  I like the quality of it and feel comfortable that it won't come loose. The belt holder is made of a strong plastic and seems to be holding up good.  It also has a swival so you can position it for hands free use.  I recomend it and trust the quality.  It may be diffilcult with a D-Cell light and am not sure if it will strech enough.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|Was very impressed with the speedy delievery. This movie was a birthday gift for my husband...look forward to watching it over and over again.

B009CVAUIU|5.0|I'm horrible at writing long book reviews without them either being (1) vague or (2) giving the entire plot away.  So I will just say that this book is beautifully written, and immensely engaging.  The characters are vivid and complex, and the story is just fun to read.  I couldn't put this book down, and absolutely enjoyed every page - there are no slow spots or boring plot lines.  It's just an excellent, well developed book with very human and compelling characters.  Get this book -- you will not be able to put it down!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game, slow at first but enjoyable. Sit every evening and play for ever. Relaxing way to end the day.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A Memory of Light is fitting ending to The Wheel of Time. Jordan with Sanderson's<br />aid was actually able to pull the threads together.
0385343248|5.0|In the 1980s, I read five James Clavell novels beginning with \\"King Rat,\\" then \\"Shogun,\\" \\"Tai-Pan,\\" \\"Noble House,\\" and \\"Whirlwind.\\"  They were all enjoyable and well-written, but the one I enjoyed the most and that has stayed with me all these years as an outstanding, exotic, action-adventure historical novel was \\"Shogun.\\"  I just finished reading it again and feel I have to confirm that this is one of the five best historical novels I've read.
B00AHGSVKS|3.0|Very well written. The plot was wonderful, but characters were introduced and discarded too quickly to form any sort of attachment with them. This wasn't a flaw, per se, but seems like a missed opportunity. Also, it becomes quite apparent midway through the book that this won't end well for humanity, and after that point, you're just preparing for the train wreck at the end.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like having access to my books on all my devices - two tablets, two home and one work computer.<br /><br />Kindle does the job and keeps everything in sync.

B009O07NDY|4.0|If you are a fan of all things Middle-earth and enjoy the movies then you'll want to add this soundtrack to your collection.<br /><br />A mix of old and new themes from Howard Shore that transports you back to the time of Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves and Men.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|I installed this app on my Acer Iconia A110 tablet so that I could move files among the computers and tablet on my<br />Windows 7 home network.  Works great.<br /><br />Update July 2013 - I installed this app on my phone also.

B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Unfortunatelly even if you have a 3D TV and 3D Bluray player that does not mean that these can convert a 3D Bluray to 2D UNLESS THE DISC IS MANUFACTURED WITH BOTH FORMATS (some discs do have both formats). In latin american countries it's common practice from film studios to sell separate 2D and 3D movies, until one year ago I was living in Mexico and movies such as Tangled, Nightmare before Christmas, Toy Story 1-2-3, Bolt among much others are only available there in separate 2D and 3D discs, wich in my opinion not only is a dirty tactic but it also will be a big hurdle for 3D format taking off with consumers. The only thing we can do is NOT BUY ANY BLURAY WITH 3D ONLY CONTENT until film studios forget about trying to make this tactic a common practice here. SHAME ON YOU DISNEY!!
B003B96AOW|5.0|collector item and all kids of different stands and poises you can create. I change it daily almost lol but for the price and all the other deadpool action figures or statues etc.. this is solid and comes with all the extra weapons and the stand its a steal and it is big, a lot bigger than most.

B0079IEPHA|5.0|I adore Suits.  It's smart and funny and sweet, and the characters are all sharply defined.  If you like comedy-dramas and can suspend disbelief on the conceit of the show, you'll probably like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game, Subway Surfers, I honestly think is the best game ever. It is obviously my favorite game and I think buyers looking for a new game should buy it.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Frankly, I was a little bored with this film. It just never really caught my attention. Ethan Hawke did a great job. I just seemed to drag on and  I didnt find it even remotely scarry.
B002O2QKJ2|5.0|I am very interested in this tiime period, This movie was a beautiful love story with a very tragic and inspiritional ending
B005LAIIJY|5.0|What a great action packed movie. It kept me on the edge start to finish. This is one of<br />Quentin Terrintinos best. All the characters where fully fleshed out and came off over the<br />top and well done. I just received the blue ray in the mail. I thought Leonardo deCaprio did<br />a memorable job as the evil and psyhcotic plantation owner Candy. Also I just couldnt get over<br />how great a performance Samuel L Jackson did playing his character. Overall the film is one<br />of those films that just stands out as a true film maverick.
B00338QENI|5.0|I really enjoyed the three-pronged approach the author took, describing the life and situation of Henrietta lacks, the science that's been achieved with her cells, and the background on how the author put this book together.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is now one of my favorite books I have ever read. The characters draw you in and make you cheer for every move they make and boo for every bad turn. I could not put this book down and am now very sad it is over and plan on reading it again soon if not to just spend some more time with all the characters.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|As always the best movie ever. I loved the Lord of the Rings and it seems i love this movie also. It also seems around christmas this the secon of these movies is coming out, I Just hope it is as good as this one. You did it again a A++++++ movie. And such intertainment.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very honest and well written account about a man's life who added so many important items We use on a daily basis.

B00A12VW86|3.0|By this point in Green Day's career you can listen to any album and song and say which song it sounds like from a prior album.  The UNO DOS TRE set delivers some solid rock music but with mostly recycled themes.  If you like Green Day or The Network, then you will like this set.  They like to say the F-word a lot!
B00881VLCE|2.0|disappointed in this game not at all challenging and very<br />boring to play I hardly go to this site at all
098478280X|5.0|Presumption is that a reader knows about the basics of data structures, algos and OOPS concepts. Going through the basics and then reading this book helps to work on the logic for interview levels. Totally recommended.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|this game is very good I can play this for a very long time<br />and not get bored !!! the graphics are great and the colors<br />are are wonderful !! enjoy playing this
B00A4YZWN2|4.0|Awesome - Good book - good series!!  I only wish it was longer and the author turned the novellas into their own books. I feel that the actual ending was rushed and over too soon. It would have been awesome if there had been more attention on Hana and her breaking free. I was very interested in the awkwardly sweet love triangle that was developing throughout the series. More, more, more!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's cute and I downloaded it at first for my daughter because she's a big fan but I enjoy it also.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I found Into the Darkest Corner to be a thrilling page-turner.  There were a couple of pages that provided chilling descriptions of how another person could creep around through one's life in a very secretive manner.

B008220C38|2.0|The original book by Leo Tolstoy is a very famous one, so we don't need to do a recap here. All you have to know is that the latest cinematic adaptation of \\"Anna Karenina\\" is directed by Joe Wright, responsible for such films as \\"Atonement\\" and the 2005 version of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" starring Keira Knightley. Back then the director tended to use filming techniques like long take, but now his penchant for so-called \\"style over substance\\" has gone too far.<br /><br />Keira Knightley (her third collaboration with the director) plays the titular heroine who has a love affair with Count Vronsky (miscast Aaron Taylor-Johnson). The familiar story is told in a unique fashion, where the viewer is constantly made aware that he/she is watching a stage production. Characters are often seen moving in an exaggerated way, as if choreographed by someone off stage.<br /><br />The problem is, despite the beautiful costumes and nice production design, the film gets less and less interesting as it goes on, with the story that is superficial and emotionally distant. It is not Anna Karenina or anyone else from Tolstoy's book, but the director himself, who takes center stage, so as to keep showing his visual tricks.<br /><br />\\"Anna Karenina\\" is a kind of film some would hail as something original, a triumph of the director's experimental approach to the classic, while others (including me) would dismiss it as something pretentious, a failed attempt of someone too self-absorbed.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I loved this product, but the battery would not charge properly.  I had to return item.  It was painless and prompt.  My money was returned promptly.  Give me a sweeper though.  Not easy to get the battery replaced.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Don't even consider purchasing this disc and the concept that it's okay to release a 3D blu-ray disc without the regular 2D counterpart.  As someone pointed out, even if you have a 3D player, it doesn't mean you want to sit wearing glasses every time you watch a movie.  I haven't seen one of these in a long time.  But the only way to stop it is not to support silly corporate greed and the marketing types who think this type of release will somehow up their profits.  On the contrary, these people directly create a wave of bad feeling toward the studio.
B0053O89RY|5.0|If you're no watching this show, you should be.  We love this show. Hilarious.  Realistic. No tacky laugh track.  Characters are developed well and families are balanced perfectly.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written. &#34;Holy crap&#34;! is probably exclaimed 50 times.An eight year old could have authored this trash. Save your time and money.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Brave shines as the most compelling Disney princess film ever made.  As appealing as the other Disney princesses are, Merida brings a healthy dose of real-life teen rebellion, a desire for independence, unique talent, and the ability to think on her own two feet to the concept of princess as a model young woman.  Additionally, this is the only Disney princess film I can think of in which the mother of the princess is still living.  The evolution of the relationship between Merida and the Queen has an extraordinary arc that will leave you in tears--it makes me cry every time.  There are some pretty scary parts that might not be appropriate for some children, and I would have loved for the songs to be on the lips of the princess and her queen mother, but Brave has nevertheless become my very favorite animated film and I'd recommend it to any parent.
B003NX75B8|4.0|It's hard enough living around a teenage boy - awkwardness, angst, struggle of self, etc. Will Grayson and the OWG (Other Will Grayson) provide excellent vehicles for teenage boy angst as we listen to each, inside their heads in alternating chapters.  Online communication, friendships, relationships and how they sprouted from everyday REAL relationships is a strong secondary theme. But front and center is friendship - whether gay or straight or with a girl classmate is, after all, the resounding theme here.<br /><br />And then there is Tiny Cooper. You have to read this book to understand the unadulterated fabulousness of not-really-tiny-in-any-sense-of-the-word Tiny Cooper. I can't do justice to Tiny Cooper here. Awesomeness doesn't come close.<br /><br />Why not a perfect 5 stars? Because the first 4 chapters make it a hard start but one that progresses to a 5 STAR by books end.<br /><br />Thanks John Green for getting inside the YA world - one that is completely enjoyable for us all - at any age. I promise. Your writing is fresh, bright, authentic and just what we need in today's world. Adolescence is as intense, screwed up, bewildering and as hopeful as ever.

1401324649|4.0|The 100-year-old man who climbed out the window and disappeared is an unusual, and quirky book. The main character, Allan, an explosion expert, has had an eventful life, paying an important role in some of the key events of the 20th century. Just before his 100th birthday celebration, out of boredom, he escapes from the old age home, unintentionally gets possession of big suitcase full of cash, and has both police and a bunch of gangsters after him. With no particular destination in mind, Allan wanders aimlessly, meets some crazy people during the journey, and has a hell of an adventure.<br /><br />This is a well written book with a very interesting story, although it's not very believable. There are two separate tracks in the book - one narrating Allan's current adventure while on run with the suitcase, the other about his younger days as an explosion expert with neutral political views caught in a world where capitalism and communism is at logger heads. Allan finds himself in the company of some of the most powerful political leaders (Stalin, Truman, Churchill, Mao) and has unknowingly been an important instrument in shaping the world as we see it today.<br /><br />With Allan, Jonas may have created the coolest 100-year-old character of all times!! Even the other characters are awesomely idiosyncratic and funny.<br /><br />The unique Scandinavian humor, characterized by its understatement and satire, is the highlight of this book. There were several line in the book that made me laugh out loud multiple times (to the amusement of people who happened to be in the vicinity).<br /><br />It would have been an even better read, if it was a couple of pages less lengthy. Otherwise, it is a very enjoyable book.<br /><br />PS: A film deal has been signed and we may see a movie version as early as the end of this year. Looking forward.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|This album is almost perfect. The only problem that i have with it is the Since U Been Gone duet, (the male lead was slightly too-weak) the exclusion of Titanium and finally the almost sub par Cups. they should have taken more of a step toward the movie version, Anna Kendrick performed the first part slightly better in the movie.<br />These are just my observations and nitpicks. you may not think these things are all that important.<br />To close, it truly is a great soundtrack. (and movie)
0316789720|5.0|My 7 year old has always loved to draw, and is very good at it.  He is obsessed with drawing cars, trains, and trucks, and I thought this would help to expand his world.  It has given him more exciting and more old-fashioned ways of drawing the various trucks on the trains.  He is even drawing animals more often, and spent all weekend with this book!  Very happy with my purchase!  I bought another book by this illustrator, exclusively with  cars, and trucks.  I am sure he will love it as well!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is a great game to play when you are bored<br />You can just sit back, relax, and play.<br />The best part is you can play with freinds and family

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game! I play it on Facebook and I'm glad it's on the kindle now. If I log into Facebook and try to play it doesn't work but if I'm playing the game and log in it works great.

B003MC5N28|5.0|My 11 year old was reading it in school and told me how she couldn't put the book down :-)<br />That was new to me. I had to read the book. It is indeed great with a message to each and everyone of us. To a future that could come true if we don't respect our world and the people in it.<br />It's a must read.
B00005JKGK|4.0|The movie gives a great overview of two generations of Chinese women and their struggles with inter-generational relationships, disappointments, assimilation. I wasn't happy that I paid extra for expedited shipping and it still took over a week.
B007KQI1NA|4.0|This unit gets usable signals inside my house, through a metal roof and siding. It is good to start near a window though so it can get initial lock on a few satellites before trying to receive the weak ones.  Houses with non-metal roofs should be no problem at all.  I think the WAAS SBAS also works (it needs to be outside with a view of the GEO satellites to the south) but not positive of that.<br /><br />The main problem I've been having is that the baud rate never changes from 4800 despite attempts to reset it.  This means only NMEA mode is useful.  In binary mode, the data is garbled since 4800 baud cannot keep up with the number of bytes sent.  Configuring gpsd to start with the -b option prevents the receiver from being switched to binary mode-- then positions can be received in NMEA mode.  If you find it was inadvertently switched to binary mode you can use 'gpsctl -f -n /dev/ttyUSB0' to reset to NMEA (kill gpsd if running first).<br /><br />Also the cable is too short.  It works fine with a 15 foot extension though that is not officially legal USB.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|After the first half of Breaking Bad ended last summer I needed something new to get into and Boardwalk Empire was the perfect show.  Terrific performances and character development, the storyline is also top notch.  On a negative note, I'm no prude, however, there is a tad bit too much gratuitous nudity which actually detracts from the quality of the show in my opinion.  Nudity which complements the story and is realistic within the characters' personalities is fine, but occasionally (rarely even) it is just over the top.<br /><br />Regardless, it is an awesome show, definitely worth checking out if you're into excellent storytelling.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|I bought this for my dad a while ago, and he still listens to it often. It's an incredible album.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game, got hooked andt love to play it! The only thing that sucks is everytime I get a new phone or device It starts all over, or when i move it to and SD card instead of the phone! but other than that it is so much fun, my toddler even likes to try!
B004LWZW8I|4.0|Another take on the Greek Gods and their manipulations of men.  Good action and effects, and a plot that doesn't leave you wondering why things are happening - often a problem with man meets his gods movies.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good reading this one was excellent . The story is a very special events and I love all of this one.  Be sure to read the book if you can.
B00CDCE9L4|5.0|I discovered during this seasons The Walking Dead and Sons of Anarchy that ITunes had the latest episode online hours before Amazon. For Vikings, it's stretching into days, not hours. Amazon, why is it that others can provide streaming service so much faster than you? I'm growing very discouraged with Amazon's inability to make the latest episodes of my favorite shows available in a timely manner.<br /><br />Five Stars for Vikings. One for Amazon :p
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This is such a great idea! download songs instead of having to store so many unwieldy CD's! What a space saver!!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book in about a day and a half because I could not put it down! This emotional journey is well written and I would recommend it anyone.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|I teach statistics to service industry companies (yea-I'm a real fun guy). I bought this book in order to inject some more interesting approaches to teaching an otherwise dry subject. I did find lots of material to use to achieve that initial intent and purpose. I also found the story to be a compelling read.<br /><br />I have recommended the book to others.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|Half way through I thought .. I'm hooked please don't end badly.. every part of this page turner gave promise to a brilliant end and not an obvious end cause there were so many ways it could of gone... I even thought oh there must be a follow up book.... is there?????? No just a bad bad end.. what a pity :(
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Another fun Angry Birds games.  I think younger children would find it difficult to win.  Most games are very challenging
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|But again terrible start and stopping off and on through the movie. Not sure if I will use it again
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a fun game for ages 6 and up.  Some games are more challageing than others.A good past time.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|But way to many times the movie would stop on it own and just have to wait 5 to 10 min  for it to start again
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The in-episode guide is fantastic.  It makes the viewing take longer, but it's worth it.  Makes me glad I don't have HBO and had to wait for the season to be released!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Again had problems with the movie, but loved the movie have bought it and will enjoy watching again! Now waiting for the next movie lol
B00000DCHI|5.0|Like...And received it Good Quality, Good price and what a bargain for 2 CD's and I have enjoyed it and hope there are more to come.
B0042TV4IC|5.0|I absolutely loved every single episode of this heartwarming British drama. I fell in love with each and every character on this show. There were so many touching episodes that depicted the sweet bonds of marriage, friendship, and family. The scenery, writing and acting was suburb. This is simple, straightforward drama at its best. No bells or whistles, just amazing actors that portray characters that are sometimes flawed, but usually always redeemed in the end. To me, Lark Rise to Candleford is a portrayal of human nature at its best. There are not too many shows that are able to put a variety of complex human emotions so poignantly onscreen. Bravo!
B0085TKAW6|3.0|Having read the first in this trilogy I felt I needed to take on the second part of this series, unfortunately I found it very ordinary.  I think Follett is trying to do too much and would have been better of making this novel into something less complex. The characters are all written to a formula, beautiful and high spirited, rich and spoilt, handsome and charming etc.  I enjoyed some of the historical aspects particularly Nazi Germany before and during the war. I also found the references to the Labor Party elections and the nationalisation of industries in Britain interesting particularly as at the time I was reading Margaret Thatcher had just died and there was much reference in the media as to how she sold these nationalised industries to private concerns. If you want to read something different and unusual then I would not recommend this novel.
B0027MJU00|3.0|This is typical Gillian Flynn. Found this very difficult to put down. The only reason for the three star rating was that I personally was a bit disappointed with the ending. Otherwise, this was an excellent read and should be great for book club discussion.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|Heads up! The AutoRip version has six bonus tracks.<br />The whole CD is great. I have to warn you this is not a edgy NIN cd. It's more like industrial house.<br /><br />The music is very well thought out. It's sophisticated for industrial house type music.
B005LAIISA|3.0|This movie to me was really boring. I only laughed 1 time during this movie!! I should of listened to some reviews and not buy it at all. I wouldn't even rent the movie. That's how bad it was!! It is just not much of a story line if you can even call it that. Trust me, don't get it at all. If you really must see it just rent it even though it is not worth that. I can't even see little kids enjoying this movie. Don't mean they will not but i just don't see it.
B00138KK62|5.0|Why are they asking for a review? Her music will sell and people will continue to love this amazing artist without my review!
B000I0RNV6|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Beautiful characters, story, music... very nostalgic and touching.<br />Having seen the theatrical version first, I thought the director's cut was too long without adding to the magic of the first version. But others disagree... In any case, this disc has both versions.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|The update is broken.  It says that there is script error. IDK what is wrong, but could you please fix it or tell us how to fix.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am so enjoying this program.  Love the acting, the story, the history. It's a not so guilty pleasure! Keep it coming!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like the fact that this app allows me to select my own music as my alarm. And the themes are gorgeous.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Very splendid follow up to Thrift Shop. The songs are deep and fulfilling or comedic. Either way they are amazing
B0058DRUV6|4.0|Wouldnt have picked up this book but for an executive a few levels above me, in an academic institution. He mentioned it in the firstntwo talks he gave. I wanted ti find out what made that guy tick.<br />This turned out to be a greatnbook. Based on real data. Mainly based on for profit companies, but the ideas hold true for non profits including academia. Worth a read!
B00865P3AS|5.0|This is quite a bit different from their first CD. The songs are all still covers, but this time they have vocals. It took me a while to get use to it but now I am in love &#60;3 I cant ever stop listening to them. BUY!
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|The animals are large and colorful. Great choice for a beginner set.  Would use this to compliment a set of duplo blocks.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Not a bad game. It's a very shortened version of scribblenauts which I'm ok with, but you have to pay for characters and there is a limited amount of objects you could place. It will only entertain you for a couple hours but is fun during that time
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I loved the fact that I never knew what was going to happen! I guessed what would happen, but I got every surprised at many points. I didn't want to put the book down! I got very exited when I figured something out!
0345528581|5.0|This book is very handy especially when you are traveling and you don't have equipment or a gym. You are definitely going to work your muscles and feel it the next day. It is suitable for all exercise levels since he explains thoroughly how you can modify. I workout everyday with a 30lbs sandbag and this book is a good add-on to my workout regime.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Solid movie. This product was new and played without a hitch. Can't wait for the next B(l)ond movie. When is it coming out?!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|a great game. no problems so far....worth the money keeps your attention recommend for everybody!!!!:) great great great great great!!!
1881273873|5.0|This is a very good book. I bought it because my small group is doing a series on it, and it is wonderful.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a big zelda fan and he LOVED it. Said it was very interesting and informative. Book came in almost new shape even though it was listed as in 'acceptable' condition.
0345529057|4.0|...albeit slow at times. I wish the author wouldn't take forever to write. Next book apparently is expected for 2014.
0670026603|5.0|You have to read this book.<br /><br />For almost a year, this book was recommended to me often. Whether it was via Goodreads' recommendations algorithm or Amazon's \\"other people who bought this book bought\\" sales push. I always clicked through to it, read the synopsis, and thought no thanks. An able-bodied person falling in love with a quadriplegic? One, sad. Two, yeah right.<br /><br />I have to say, I was totally and completely wrong. Stunning. That's how I would describe this book. I'm amazed at how quickly I was drawn into the characters' lives. Told from the point of view of Lou, the down-on-her-luck caretaker of Will, a surly quadriplegic with nothing but disdain for the world around him. Lou soon discovers the real reason she has been assigned this job - keeping Will from coming to self harm before a pre-set date, when he will make the decision to take his own life. Lou uses the time she has left to change his mind, and every step of the way you are hoping along with her that it will work.<br /><br />Lou is endearing and sweet while never veering into nauseating. Will is surly and moody but never unlikeable. I mean, can you blame him? His parents are both deeply flawed and yet admirable in their love for their son. Lou's family is also imperfect, but they were so human that you could forgive them. Every detail of this story, every character and setting, was nuanced and multi-dimensional.<br /><br />Just... perfection. While this book is slightly political (without ever being preachy), it's really just a story about humanity, which at its core revolves around love. In the past year, three books I have read have gotten a 5-star rating. I don't dole these things out lightly. So give it a shot.
030758836X|1.0|I cannot for the life of me understand why so many people are reading this book. The characters are all despicable. The plot is telegraphed right from the beginning. You know exactly where it is going after the first 100 pages. I can only conclude that most of the people who like this book read bodice rippers or enjoy mysteries by the likes of Danielle Steele and Mary Higgins Clark.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|My alarm on my phone was getting to be unreliable. I downloaded this app, and it has work wonderfully. I love how you set the days of the week in, very usefully.
B000067CPX|5.0|I hadn't heard some of the songs featured in this particular album in a while. And recently I heard the song &#34;Dosed&#34; on the radio and I immediately wanted to purchase this album. I loved it, great for road trips!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Well I think they should give you 24 hours to play so if you want a game you can play as long as you want look for block story and it free
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|What a cool little light this is, the sensor works well and it doesn't turn on when its dark which would waste the batteries it only turns on when it senses your heat coming around it. This works perfect in a dark closet and its a really cool designed light as well. I like how the led's are spaced around the light. Wonderful.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Fantastic writing! Martin writes, you read and want more. This is a story that draws you in and keeps you engaged.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|My daughter and I love watching the twilight series. It brings you up to Breaking dawn part 2 which is thrilling and suspenseful.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|For me, it's the writing, casting and the actor's delivery.  I can't imagine anyone else in the roles.<br /><br />Of course, the production values are superb.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|While this novel was published after Chrichton had passed away and was ultimatley finished by Preston you can't tell.  The book reads like a classic Chrichton novel through and through.
0812550706|5.0|I read this in high school, but never finished it b/c I was an idiot in high school and I thought that reading is for suckers. Now I am re-reading all the required books I used to ignore in HS. This is one of them and WOW great book. Great characters, and story. Very psychological and intelligent as well. If you're into sci-fi but looking for a very human story, this is it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am an avid Stephen King reader for years now.  While I have noticed a slight decline to the quality of his writings recently he came roaring back with this one.  While it does tend to get a little bogged down with the love interest aspect the overall story continues to shine through.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game..I had been playing it on my iPhone but was so happy to find it on my kindle fire. It is much easier to see on the fire. I am hooked.<br />Updated 5/30/2013<br />I really like this game.However it constantly freezes or would close up.I would have to keep rebooting my Kindle to play it.Anytime I would go to the garden it froze or quit. I continued to play it anyway and was up to level 30 and then my game disappeared. I downloaded from the cloud, it is starting me all over again. It saved all of my friends but not my progress.I feel with all of the hassles of the freezing and stopping it is not worth my effort to start all over again. :(
B004UPALT6|3.0|This was OK. I remember this movie being more goofy/horror when I first saw it in the 1980s - must be me. Still have a lot of blood and gore which makes it one of the best demonic movies out there. Still holds it own after all these years. Still like the demons screaming, &#34;Dead By Dawn&#34;, think that is the best part of the whole movie.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Not as good as the Snowman, but a great Harry Hole novel. There were certainly more complex stories that were sometimes confusing
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I love books and shows about zombies and the undead. I actually saw the preview of this book's movie counterpart, and quickly decided to read it before it comes out.<br /><br />Some of he interview parts were great, but some lost me a bit and were not too exciting.  All in all, it was an entertaining book.
B000V7FZ7U|5.0|I purchased this CD for my husband he really likes it and plays it in the car a lot. Nice CD
B000X5SPBI|5.0|can't say enought about my winchester boys, absolutely love watching them get older and better each season and they have great common sense with humor thrown in. i would highly recommend every season to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have read all three books in the Fifty Shades trilogy and frankly, I don't understand all the negative reviews I have read attached to this series.  Obviously, the negative reviewers have not truly read this book with an open eye to the subtext of the story.  The book is not &#34;mommy porn&#34; it is a story of redemption through the love of a good woman and a good man who thinks he is worthless.  Any reader of reasonable intelligence should be able to dig deeper into the character of Christian and Ana and be able to see how broken he is and how determined to help she is.  Try to get over the explicit sex scenes and dig a little deeper.  It is a great story line and should be read with this in mind.  And yes, some of the wording Ana uses is a bit immature, but remember, folks, SHE'S 21!!  She's going to be a little immature.  Do you remember yourself at 21?  Keep reading, she grows up in the timeline of the book.  Overall, fabulous job, E L James! Write me another one.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|i love this dvd, i just can't get enough of my winchester boys, i love watching them get older and better as the seasons go on and am so in love with them i actually spend time looking for their 64 chevy muscle car  on the computer whenever my daughter is in the room with me just to irritate her. i talk about sammy and dean all the time, my daughter keeps saying to me, you know they aren't real.  oh well, i have two black standard poodles and now i know dean has a little poodle and a big poodle hybrid, now i am even more in love with him. lol. i hear they are on board for a ninth and tenth season.  love my texas boys.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|this was for my sister and she loved the series.  Being a biker chic its no wonder.  Right up her alley
B009X01GJ2|4.0|I am very pleased with my purchase of this case. I chose this one because of the rotating holder feature. I am very happy with how that functions. Given the weight of the Fire HD, it is great to be able to rotate it and prop it up while reading! The only minor flaw to me is that the outside material, while durable, is a little slick to hold on to. I wish it was a little more textured or something. That may change once the \\"newness\\" wears off.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|It's catchy, it's fun, what more do you want from a Fall Out Boy album?  People who want to hear more from the band but not more of the same will be pleased.  It feels like a natural progression.  \\"The Phoenix\\" and \\"Save Rock and Roll\\" are the standouts so far.
098555780X|5.0|The author is great at all his projects.  But he uses a smaller grade paracord that is hard to find.  When using the 550 paracord you give up flexibility.  And while each project is well documented-- I still found myself wondering how he got from one picture to the next.  Ultimately, I have up this new hobby out of anger and frustration.
080508990X|5.0|Bill Martin,Jr. and Eric Carle team up for another book for the toddler and preschooler set. The repetitive text, colorful illustration and marvelous subject matter (North American animals) are a winning combination. I bought this book for my soon to be 2 year old. She loves it, but my 3 year old and 5 year old also enjoy it. The 3 year old has it memorized at this point and can &#34;read&#34; it on her own or to her little sister.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater.  I realize that Peter Jackson wants to make 3 movies to maximize profit... but the hobbit barely gets out of the shire and they don't get to the dragon.  Unless you're a fanatic for the series you'll be bored watching it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the best weather app I have found. While traveling, am able to see what kind of weather is ahead.<br />At home am able to plan projects days ahead. Have found this app to be very accurate.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I love Muse but this album is nothing like the first Muse albums I listened to and fell in love with. However I still really like it. Yes I do love their old work and it sounds completely different but I love music and love hearing new music.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Too bad the album sucks! Only one halfway decent song on it. Got the code so it was worth it!
B00881VLCE|4.0|This game plays like its table top cousin. You can play easy (42 pieces not rotated) or difficult (288 pieces rotated) or anywhere in between.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|For years I have wanted to own this DVD.  IT REMINDS US SINNERS what God did for us for loving this world - that he gave His Only Son -- so that we could have eternal life.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I bought this CD the day it was released through Amazon.  My expectations were exceeded beyond my wildest imagination!  I expected a release comparable to 'Heathen,' with perhaps a few interesting moments.<br /><br />Instead, Bowie has provided a solid album with not a single weak song on it.  The songwriting is impeccable, filled with hooks, and memorable, catch lyrics and harmonies throughout.  The guitar work truly stands out.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you're remotely interested in Bowie.  Having listened to this CD at least 20 times (it has been on constant rotation in my car for two months), I can attest that it compares favorably to some of his 70's catalog.<br /><br />My hats off to David Bowie for producing such a relevant and excellent work when many had written him off!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|The story telling is fast paced and the story gets going very quickly. For me this meant that I was hooked from page three. The story is solid, but shallow at times, the characters make obvious choices and you can feel the twists coming miles ahead.<br /><br />The book is good entertainment, but for me to receive more stars, the story needs to be more compelling, moving, or otherwise remarkable. I'm definitely going to buy the next book and continue the story, so hopefully the writer will add depth to the characters and not so obvious turns in the plot.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Ghost actually deserves all the hype they are getting nowadays. It's mad cool to have followed this band from the beginning because I really get the feeling they are making music history. I know, those are big words, but Ghost is by far the most exciting band in hard rock/metal at the moment. I really loved their brilliant first album and the new \\"Infestissumam\\" continues where the debut ended. \\"Year Zero\\" is my favorite song at the moment, but I feel the whole album is very strong from start to finish. I only wish it was longer. I guess I will have to buy the deluxe edition also (2 additional songs on that edition). Anyway, nuff said, you really need to buy this album!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is a awesome game but it doesn't count that good by that I mean how far u ran. I would really recommend this. Please let this be helpful to you.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|I should not give this even a one star. After installing on my Kindle HD it simply would not load. I glad it was free.
B0091LRZZW|5.0|This is a great album that remembers a time in music when sophistication and style.  I love to play this for my 1 year old so she gains an appreciation for classics.  Great for background music during get togethers with friends and dinner parties.
0451197968|5.0|Love all Stephen king books,... they are all worth the price to me but I really couldn't put this one down...
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is very relaxing and i think it helps your problem solving skills and its fun but sometimes confusing
B007NRWLZ0|5.0|We love Spawn and have been looking for it in stores for a while to no avail.  Luckily it was online and ON blue ray! love it
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so fun, I love it because I am a animal lover , and the peeps who are animal lovers too, and like building towns like SIM city (or a ZOO ) then ,GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW AND YOU WON'T LOOK AWAY FOR A SECOND
B000KIRT6A|4.0|I don't have any real praise or complaints about this.  I does just what it should, and for the price, it's pretty good.  Like most pedals, it can be used with a 9V plug-in transformer, but it's not included.  Yes, it's made of plastic, but you can't expect any more for $25.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Elegant app that serves well to remind me of my favorite TV shows as well as acting as my alarm clock when needed. Has a range of good sounds to choose from. One thing it doesn't do that I' d like it to is to show the real time on its icon on my apps or in the carousel.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|I love this DVD because I can invoke more detail than what was originally shown in the theater version.  It makes this video come alive.  I saw the movie at first in the theater and this is so much better.
B0063GORYU|4.0|A good game and a great way to pass too much time.  I call it the mind eraser  I will be ordering other games
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Promising continuation of the Bourne story. If you liked the original series you should like this one. The ending leaves opening for more...
0984334904|3.0|It could be nice that the box include a guide to use it.<br /><br />The quality is great but i need more help to use it.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Everything hear is, all I had hope for and even (better/More).  The only let down, drawback was with Roll On John.  It was a great song!  It had a great Sound, but this is, the only song, where the vocals/ Words, were somewhat LESS discernible.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Great new CD from Blake. Boys Round here, love, love, love! It's more of his real music, he's on top of his game!
B007Z5M6F0|5.0|Loved it. I thought that Eddie Redmayne and Joseph Mawle turned in extraordinarily intelligent and sensitive performances. I highly recommend it.
1582701709|3.0|I read The Secret years ago, and I still re-read parts of it when I need a little pick-me-up, because I believe that the basic principle it attempts to teach is for real. However, I found the reference to old, wise and successful scientists, writers etc to be downright laughable, since it provides no verifiable proof, or ANY information at all, as to how or when these geniuses used \\"the secret\\" to accomplish such amazing feats. It is packed with propaganda-like catch phrases typically thought up by any average marketing team. The instructions are deliberately and conveniently vague, and I found myself questioning how this principle could be for real, thereby losing all my faith and positive vibes.<br />Having said that, I believe that it is a positive book, and will open the eyes and sense of awareness of many, and that in itself is commendable. For further reading and more insight, I suggest \\"The Nature of Personal Reality\\" by Jane Roberts.
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|I'll admit that I was little worried about the future of Spock's Beard after Nick left the band. After hearing the new album I can say that I worried for nothing! Ted Leonard sounds absolutely fantastic on the vocals and Jimmy Keegan who has been the Beard's touring drummer, doesn't miss a beat. In short, Nick's departure hasn't hurt the band at all. In fact, it seems to have re-energized them. The songs are catchy and the melodies are beautifully infectious. It's the most Neal sounding SB album since Neal left if that makes sense. I loved X, but there is something about BN&DS that is just special. Fantastic production, fantastic musical performances by all members of the band (especially bass player Dave Meros who is the most underrated bass player around)and fantastic songs make this one of the Beard's best albums!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next book! I read this one in one day. It was too hard to put down!
B000021XS0|5.0|This album literally changed my life and after 10 years it is still my favorite album. Not only did SFaM introduce me to Dream Theater, who has been my favorite band since hearing this album, but it introduced me to the Progressive Rock/Metal genre. Without SFaM I would have never heard of some of my other favorite bands such as Symphony X, Opeth, Between the Buried and ME, 3, Nightwish, Spock's Beard/Neal Morse, Threshold, The Dear Hunter, and Rush.<br /><br />As mentioned above, Dream Theater is my favorite band and in my opinion this is their best album. I could right pages on the history of the band and each individual member, but if you listen to this album and fall in love with it like I did, then chances are you will be a Dream Theater expert in no time. SFaM is a concept album with a rather complicated story dealing with reincarnation. This album is a musical tour de force and features some of Dream Theaters best writing both musically and lyrically. I really can't say enough about this album. If you are new to Dream Theater or are just looking for some new music then buy this album!!!!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I have gotten so hooked into this series I have already purchased all of the books. I can't wait to rea  th  next book.
B007SGM084|5.0|Absolutely without a doubt one of the best books I've read in a very long time!!! I can't wait to re-read it
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game ever love going on survival mode and creative mode it is so much fun.to just sit down and plat it and I am 13 ani still love this game
0062014102|5.0|Please read this. Michael Talbot uses his own drive to discover truth and check facts to bring profound information about the nature of our reality to your eyeballs!<br />What you think you know is all an illusion...
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Didn't spend a dime &amp; still beat this title. Not paying is not a game killer like some free to play titles.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This was the first edgy show FX created; Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, Nip/Tuck, they all came after this show. Simply put, Kurt Sutter does an amazing job of writing shows for FX.
B009CWWFD2|4.0|Big fan of Jeffrey Archer and The Fourth Estate does not disappoint. This is a quick read which is bad because this is the kind of book you don't want to end. Pick it up, you'll be glad you did.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|very original game, I would recommend it to everyone. it kind of drains the battery on my kindle quick though
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It's a really great movie!  It was much better than what we expected.  I recommend you watch it for sure.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Wonderful, fluent read. Characters are well developed, the story progresses at a solid pace, and the writing is eloquent. Must-read !
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It might not really hit you the first time you watch it, but this movie sticks with you.  I find myself mulling over it weeks later - really cool movie.
0061906220|5.0|The book is good but the song is great great great!  The book is only the best with the song.  You must download the song and sing along.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I'm not a 30 rock fan, but I loved Tina Fey in SNL and movies. This book is a great, hysterical read. She is candid and so on!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This is right up there with the Godfather I & II as one of the greatest mob/gangster movies of all time.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors of all-time.  And he puts this movie together perfectly, getting pitch perfect performances from his actors.<br /><br />This is a very fun, entertaining, yet gritty and violent film.  Huge recommendation if you like the crime/mob genre.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I enjoyed &#34;Thor&#34; even more than I expected to.  The story moves quickly, is well-acted, and is very engaging.  Kenneth Branagh's direction is inspired, and the special effects are commendable. I recommend it for any fans of comic book movies, science fiction, and action pictures.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|There's no other movie like this that I know of.  The plot is very original and pure Americana.  It strikes to the heart of racism in the United States and how young people can be indoctrinated into the racist ideologies.<br /><br />The acting is great across the board.  The story is unique, unpredictable, and entertaining from start to finish.  Very emotional, wild ride.<br /><br />Check it out if you can handle an intense movie.
B001PPGAJY|4.0|&#34;X2&#34; is a very good sequel, perhaps even better than its parent movie.  The special affects are seamless, the acting excellent, and the story never less than engaging.  Recommended for fans of comic book movies, science fiction, and action pictures.
B00005O3VC|4.0|The movie is as expected with slapstick humor. Always good for a laugh along the way. Fun for a group to watch.
B006GH6IS4|5.0|&#34;Days of Our Lives&#34; is a very enjoyable history of the band, at least for the casual Queen fan such as I.  I think the story of the band is well-told, with good interviews, and the half-dozen bonus videos are a real treat.  There's nothing special about the Blu-ray picture -- a DVD would have been sufficient, but the price was good on the Blu-ray....
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Show captures your interest and keeps it.  Always something different and unusual - week after week.  I love this show!
B0064MT1U8|5.0|&#34;Shakespeare in Love&#34; is a delightful, unique fiction of the Bard and the inspiration behind &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34;.  Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow are wonderful, as is the supporting cast (though, in my humble opinion, the always fine Judi Dench didn't really have much to do to earn that Best Supporting Actress Academy Award).<br /><br />The film is very funny, very romantic, very engaging despite its longish running time, a bit bawdy, but never less than entertaining.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|Bravo to Willie and his band! This is what singing, musicianship and song writing are all about! Regardless of the genre and your preferences, this is a masterpiece. Do not shy away from this album because it is \\"country.\\" It breathes such life and fills your soul. Bravo!
B002CMXAYW|4.0|&#34;This is Spinal Tap&#34; is a lot of fun, but the fun dissipates somewhat once the members of the band have their falling-out.  In fact, many of the deleted scenes (on the special features menu) are frequently more amusing than some of what was kept in the movie.  Still there's a lot of really funny stuff here and &#34;This is Spinal Tap&#34; is one-of-a-kind.  The blu-ray picture is nothing special -- it didn't seem any better than your run-of-the-mill DVD to me -- but since the blu-ray disc was cheaper than the DVD, I got the blu-ray.  If you like &#34;Best in Show&#34;, &#34;Waiting for Guffman&#34;, or &#34;A Mighty Wind&#34; you'll probably enjoy this mock rockumentary.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|The lilt and simplicity of language is quieting and enjoyable. I learned a little and enjoyed the images created by the writer.
B001PPGAJE|4.0|A wonderful start to a franchise with at least two excellent sequels is &#34;X-Men&#34;  This story of the rise of people with mutations that give them extraordinary abilities is moving, funny, and exciting.  The actors are superb, the special effects are undistractingly good, and the pace is quick.  Recommended for fans of comic book movies, science fiction, and action pictures.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having experienced a NDE several years ago Dr. Alexander's book brought back some memories of my experience some of which were life changing.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I enjoyed &#34;Captain America&#34; even more than I expected to.  The story moves quickly, is well-acted, and is very engaging.  I recommend it for any fans of comic book movies, science fiction, and action pictures.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Hey this is a COOL GAME EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT!!!  Coolness yeah alright and play with your friends!!! Yeah Boy COOL BEANS YEAH!!!
B0014D6PCO|5.0|While most critics and fans prefer the first sequel, I still think &#34;Batman Begins&#34; is the best of the many Batman movies.  The story, though long, never flags and the entertainment is unfailing.  All the actors are excellent, the vistas of the far East are breathtaking, the scenes in Gotham appropriately dark, and the tale established the Batman character quite capably.  Really, it's an inspired retelling.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|One of the best books I have read! Action moved along steadily and I couldn't wait for the next page. Characters very well done, brought to life by the author. Looking forward to reading the entire series.
0307749347|4.0|The ideas in this book/cd are fresh and useful.  I like that the author has a sense of humor.  However, I wish that he had not read from the book, but rather taped a live lecture.  The reading was a little too monotonous, although the content was good.
B003YUQ9CG|4.0|Good quality shoe and very lightweight. Unfortunately, like other reviewers have noted, these run small. I had to return them and will order a full size up.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is the best game on the kindle it's so awesome free roaming NYC AS SPIDERMAN<br />It as awesome in my opinion I highly recommend this game
B008RXYOKY|3.0|Yeah its an adapter but honestly for the money we paid for the retina laptop they should include accessories like this or at least make it more affordable. We get gouged every time you have to buy something the previous model had. 30 dollars is a ripoff. I am guessing its easily 29 dollars pure profit...
B004SIP6BI|4.0|What I found most fun about this movie was the atmosphere of the small French town - the townspeople cracked me up. The movie also has a wonderful mystical quality that makes it feel like a timeless fairy tale of sorts.
B005LAII4E|1.0|This movie is really really bad.. charaters changed (baroness, cool charater, no more) the new ones not that good. The story with no contain. I barely believe they pretend make #3.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I enjoy this game. Nice graphics, good level of challenge. It is annoying how it tries to sell you in-game items, but that's expected from a free game.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I have been wanting to start this series forever. Although starting a new series with so many books ahead of you always seems a bit daunting. My solution to this was to agree to read one new book from the series in between my other books. This way I am able to spread them out rather than feel the weight of reading each of them back to back. So, you are probably wondering... was the wait worth it? Yes. I am so glad I read this and I am excited to officially be in the Percy Jackson world.<br /><br />\\"My name is Percy Jackson.<br />I'm twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy Academy, a private school for troubled kids in upstate New York.<br />Am I a troubled kid?<br />Yeah. You could say that.\\"<br /><br />I went into The Lightning Thief knowing full well that this series is meant for children. Even with this being the case I had absolutely no problem following the story and falling in love with the characters. There is just enough fantasy, action and drama to keep the story exciting from start to finish. I have suggested this to not only my adult friends but also to the children of my adult friends. It really is a universal story and age should be of no concern.<br /><br />\\"Names have power.\\"<br /><br />I have always been a huge lover of Greek Mythology. This is part of the reason why I can't believe it took me this long to start these. I loved every single character introduced and found myself smiling each time I had a feeling a new God was going to make an appearance. It was a lot of fun to see how many I could guess based on what was happening at that time in the book.<br /><br />\\"Knowing too much of your future is never a good thing.\\"<br /><br />I adored Percy. He has just the right mix of bravery and self confidence.... with a bit of realistic expectations mixed in. He always acts first and thinks second which of course can cause some extreme circumstances but even with his bravery and confidence he knows his limits. He knows he is not a God but that doesn't stop him from speaking his mind around them. He stands up for his friends and his family.<br /><br />I also loved his friends. Grover and Annabeth are both loyal and down right funny. They both had me laughing several times throughout the book.<br /><br />\\"Grover murmured, \\"Well, Percy, what have we learned today?\\"<br />That three-headed dogs prefer red rubber balls over sticks?\\"<br />No,\\" Grover told me. \\"We've learned that your plans really, really bite!\\"<br /><br />Like I said I will be gradually working my way through this series, and honestly I have to say I am really excited to see where Percy will take me next.<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Readse is not a God but that doesn't stop him from speaking his mind around them. He stands up for his friends and his family.<br /><br />I also loved his friends. Grover and Annabeth are both loyal and down right funny. They both had me laughing several times throughout the book.<br /><br />\\"Grover murmured, \\"Well, Percy, what have we learned today?\\"<br />That three-headed dogs prefer red rubber balls over sticks?\\"<br />No,\\" Grover told me. \\"We've learned that your plans really, really bite!\\"<br /><br />Like I said I will be gradually working my way through this series, and honestly I have to say I am really excited to see where Percy will take me next.<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Reads
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great for me in updated version. Not sure why so many other people are having issues. Far better than old version for me.
B005LAZIRY|2.0|No. This is not experimenting. This is not a sudden, new, brilliant Opeth. This is Mikael Åkerfeldt's pussification of the Opeth I knew.<br /><br />\\"Experimenting\\" would be Mastodon's new album, \\"The Hunter.\\" Slightly different, absolutely. Maybe even a little more \\"mainstream.\\" But it doesn't matter, because it still sounds good, and at the end of the day, IT STILL SOUNDS LIKE A MASTODON ALBUM.<br /><br />Going in a comlpetely direction then previously only works about once in a hundred times. And \\"Heritage\\" isn't one of those times.<br /><br />What happened to albums like \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\"? Or \\"Morningrise\\"? Hell, even \\"Ghost Reveries\\"? they are ALL still very metal, and have a dark feeling to them, (Especially My Arms Your Hearse.) Yet they are all intelligent, and were meaningful. That's the Opeth I knew and loved. Heavy as hell, atmospheric, Intelligent, and both Brutal and Beautiful.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because the actual skill of the musicians isn't bad, obviously, if you've listened to Opeth before.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Perfect for cruising. Her voice is haunting, will give you chills. Reminds me of a modern day Billie Holiday. Woooo
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best.just all of the TNT.boooomm!! house like a house boat and cruise ships.time to<br />die. all over again.it's just so cool it's just very cool.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I cant get the songs out of my head, so catchy & perfect. its a nonstop loop in my head. Its driving me wild ;)
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was a great book.It showed me more about the hunger games. It's an inspiration book to read and enjoy. Its a really great book. I would read it again
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Was good read. I don't usually read love story's, but did enjoy this one. Didn't want to put it down.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|But I hate the fact that I found it long after they canceled the show :( Watch all of the episodes and youwill feel the same.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Fun!  Except wish it was free!  Its okay at the first try I didn't know how to play!  I got the demo and it was really easy to play!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I so enjoyed this book! The descriptions of Jamie's early hardships and abuses broke my heart but opened the door for the joy to come. I was horrified to find out that orphanages similar to the one in this book continued to operate in Ireland until the 1990's!
0789318245|5.0|This was a anniversary gift for my boyfriend. He loved it. I love it. Great quality book and super fast shipping. All round great
B009CGLO3K|5.0|Rarely buy movies, glad I got this one. Great direction and script. And Charlize makes evil look really good, in a bad sort of way.
B00138GZAC|5.0|sade is awesome. i feel like she is one of the most underrated artists. more people need to get onto the sade train - it will be the best ride of your life
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This was a surprising movie for me. I enjoyed the twist at the end. Well put together and acted well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|One of the best free games on kindle. The game play is very fluid..not glitchy. Level ups keep you &quot;running&quot;
1400052181|5.0|I read this book when it first came out in hard back and went through the entire range of emotions.  I was mad that the doctors took advantage of this woman and the treatments that she went through.  I was surprised and dumb founded to discover that when you are giving blood/cells/tissues it becomes the property of the labs and they can do with what they please.  A very insightful book into the medical field and how they viewed one woman.<br /><br />Highly recommend it for anyone.
B004XGN8W4|1.0|The screen is crap, lets establish that and get it out of the way. Why are you buying this? Could it be for the screen? Probably, I'll bet, I did. Blurry, fuzzy.... a complete mess of a picture is what I can tell you it is. Forget everything else, case, durable, yada-yada. The picture is horrid. One of, if not the worst picture I have ever seen on a screen since — forever wouldn't be too much of as stretch — well, that's actually it. FOREVER. I had one of the first Sony LCD monitors from the start of this past decade and that thing, despite all it's ancient-ness was and still is better looking — even with vga connections. This thing, NAY, abomination looks like you took a really s***ty monitor and hooked up an xBox via RF adapter, even though it's using HDMI!!<br /><br />This is too much... my heart.... my heart.... *falls to a knee*<br /><br />No! No! Don't help me up.<br />I got this.<br /><br />There isn't anything to discuss here. Only if you REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, need to have a mobile solution that utilizes a screen should you go here, and even then you shouldn't expect to play anything well that requires a good eye. FPS games are out of the question, especially if playing multi-player; which you probably are if you are using this in the first place. Fighting games: okay. Certain RPG's: okay. Everything else: Nope. I bought this as a toy — had the monies to blow — but I really wanted it to be decent. It's not even that. Figure out something else if you want mobility. You won't find it with this.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it is a fun game that burns some time. easy way to make money. hard to expand without spending your own money
B00992CF6W|5.0|My dad wouldn't let me get the full version on my computer so  I got this one instead. And just because it is EXPENSIVE, it is an amazing app and I am a 10 year old GIRL and I love this. ( yes, it is not just for boys) I really recommend this app to creative people. I have always wanted an app that u can express your ideas, play w friends, and meet new people. This is amazing!!!  Both modes are amazing! Get it it is completely worth your money! Bye I'm gonna play minecraft now
B0057R5G6E|5.0|First off, the normal price is a bit steep, but I luckily got the item on sale for only $45, which was much more than a bargain. The statue is absolutely beautiful, as well as the quality of the dvds. I was excited to find you get Episode 1 of Tell Tale's Jurassic Park game for free, and even though it says that the digital copy codes need to be used by 12/21/12, mine still worked in 4/13, so that is nothing to be worried about. Just a great gift to any one who liked Jurassic Park, or even just a T Rex fan. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quality of both the DVDs and the Statue is great<br />Statue is hand painted.<br />Always nice to relive this epic film.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Price is a bit steep, but if you can get it on sale, go for it for sure.
B008DKBO8G|5.0|This is a very stylish, great fitting cover that offers good protection for the Kindle.  I'd definitely look at other Timbuktu products.
1609611543|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I think Dr. Davis made a lot of great points and I have stopped eating wheat as a result.  Not all books can have such a profound effect on someone's diet, but this is one of them.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|.The music and the ethereal orbs join the make an enjoyable experience.  Nice to play when you want to relax and not think too much or be accosted by blood and guts.
B00AOQ8KCU|5.0|FBI, surfing, beaches, parties, bank robberies, skydiving, romance, Gary Busey.  This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Love it!
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This is the first book by Frankl I read and I was so impressed that I have read every other book I can find by him. Do your self a favor and get this book. You will not regret it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is amazing! This and Gone Girl are must reads. I can't wait to start Dark Places, I'm sure it's going to be just as captivating as the two I've read.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is the incredible story of Dr. Alexander's journey during the 7 days he spent in a coma.  Because he is a neurosurgeon, he explains the science behind his disease process along with what happens to the brain in its comatose state.  His is an fascinating story & it's a mircle that he was able to share it with us!
B00475AYJQ|3.0|I enjoyed Name of the Wind, and hoped to like Wise Man's Fear more than I do.  Unfortunately, the sequel moves the story along at such a slow pace that it is hard to keep interested. As several other reviewers noted, the main character (Kvothe) is also becoming less and less likable as the story progresses. We're supposed to be reading the story of a legendary adventurer, and yet the book reads more like the story of an arrogant kid who can't stop telling you how clever he is.
1416955070|3.0|Recently there have been several books that I have picked up... and not finished.  I don't know why, but for some reason I just really was not into them.  The stories were all just ok, but nothing could hold my attention span... Until City of Bones.<br /><br />This book left me with a lot of mixed feelings.  I don't think I loved it as much as other readers. I did not find it on par with some of the other YA series I've read.  The writing itself was mediocre.  The book suffers from flat characters, none of whom were real compelling or relatable, I'm honestly not sure if they are even likable.  Although Jace was the most interesting of all of the characters, there really wasn't any one character that grabbed me, . That said, I think the characters were true to form... they were teenagers and they acted like teenagers.  There were several points where they acted with teenage naivet&eacute;.  They were way too trusting, too reckless, not as savvy as the tenuous situation required.  Overall as a reader, I had a feeling more of being a watcher than there in the thick of the action with the characters (I hope someone out there knows what I mean).<br /><br />Now you may think this means I didn't like the book.  The truth is I liked it.  The story was interesting!  It kept me coming back to see what would happen next.  There was more than one big reveal moment in the book  that I did not see coming.  Having finished this book I am looking forward to reading the next book.  I think the story will make an good movie and I can't wait to see where the story heads as the series continues.  The book benefits from a compelling plot,  interesting secondary characters like Magnus and the Brotherhood who are intriguing and you want to know more about. The story continually moves forward.  I just think it would be a better book with multi-dimensional characters and better writing.<br /><br />Nook Pages:372 (include preview to the Clockwork Angel series)
B007URVZJ6|1.0|You will be very frustrated if you go by what this books says. My grip with this book (Building Your Book for Kindle) is that your book will have no table of contents. The Kindle previewer is another mess. I recommend Amazon to withdrew this book and make a instruction book that works.<br /><br />Can you imagine your ebook without a toc (Table of Contents) customers will complain.
B000001EYO|5.0|todas excellente, y grandioso!! compro ex la musica compacto disco!! rapido!! claro. MUY RAPIDO!! Fantastico compacto disco...., numerno uno compro!!

B00C8YOIR2|4.0|Good story that will keep you going back with a little each day. It was a. It slow, but deep, and a great and meaningful payoff. I recommend it if you ever wondered about those friendly ghosts you still miss.
B003UESJHO|5.0|this guy does a great job in The Other Guys. Him and WIll Arnett have a couple things in common. First the both did this thing with Jennifer Anniston
B009APMNB0|5.0|Smile installed easily on a Windows 7 64-bit PC. Just followed the very clear instructions to leave the hardware unit disconnected, first install the software, then connect the hardware unit / optical sensor. It provides onscreen directions that are pretty foolproof. It even gives an outline region in which to place the hardware sensor.<br /><br />The hardware sensor drapes over the monitor. There is a counterweight on the cord that can be moved along the cord (I did not have to do so) to help hold the unit in place against the screen within the designated outline area (which is near the center of the screen).<br /><br />The calibration process is automatic and takes several minutes. Once done it lets you compare pre- and post-calibration. For my Dell monitor there was a noticeable difference and the calibrated tones were clearly more natural looking.<br /><br />They claim that even with new LCD monitors the calibration should be repeated monthly. For older monitors (e.g. several years old) it shold be repeated weekly for critical setups where color accuracy is really important.<br /><br />It is important to keep the optical sensors on the bottom of the hardware module clean. One easy way to help is to KEEP the plastic piece in which the unit is packed. It is a handy storage case.<br /><br />What more can I say? Reasonable cost, installed easily, easy to use, seems to do a very good job. Yes - I recommend it!<br /><br />If this review was useful, please let me know with the voting button.
B0013ND30M|1.0|It is scratched beyond use.It plays then skips ahead threw out the entire disc.It never should have been sold in that condition.
0061990477|5.0|A sad book in which Maggie, the heroine, manages to destroy everyone around her without really being evil.<br /><br />She did help to propagate the illustrious Briccassart line for one more generation, but by hiding his destiny and doing nothing about the last heir of the family becoming a priest, she helps to destroy it too.<br /><br />She is also instrumental for destroying virtually all of her brothers who simply disappear without trace.<br /><br />The one she does not destroy is Justine, daughter of a prole, but it is impossible to imagine that she will ever have children to continue the line. In fact, it is another tragedy that after all the noble people die, the prole's daughter gets to outlive them all.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|I have watched this series from the beginning. It is simply the best thing that I have ever seen on television. The writing was brilliant and the acting was amazing. Spartacus, you will be missed.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|love it. Now not so much. In fact I got so sick of it disconnecting every time I had a bingo that I deleted it. Missed it, tried again...and deleted. Did this a few times. I think I'm done. Fix the bugs and get the rating I would've given a few months ago.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this series, mostly because it makes you think... and then there's also the action, the sarcasm or did they actually mean it that way?? hmmmm
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Being a rail fan, this game is a lot of fun. Only compaint is the difficulty curve is a bit to quick.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|When I bought this book I really had no idea what to expect. I don't consider myself a Stephen King fan nor someone who typically reads on this topic. This book absolutely blew me away! His writing style is so different and refreshing in this book - I found myself frequently highlighting quotes on my Kindle. The twists and turns of the characters involved turned it into a true page turner, and right up until the last few pages I still had no idea how it was going to end. A must-read!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the Downton Abbey series. I would recommend it to anyone, especially to Jane Austen fans. I was addicted after the first episode.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I've listened to this album twice so far every song is decent  and it's very relaxing, I love how it soothes my frayed nerves after a long and frustrating drive home. I've heard of this artist before but this is the first album of hers that I have bought, I'll definitely look into getting some more of her albums.
B0044JTISS|5.0|this is my favorite simon and garfunkel album. i think bridge over troubled waters was written for many of us
B009X01D9U|3.0|Never thought I had to spend so much time on researching for a case.  To start with, the thought of spending $50 to protect a $270 device (~20% of product price) is repulsive.  Bought this for $30, I would have preferred something cheaper if options were available.<br /><br />This case is functional, definitely heavy, but it does its job.  Few reasons why I went for this:<br /><br />1) Landscape / portrait option<br />2)  Charging with the case closed (such a basic feature, surprised some others don't have it)<br />3)  Price<br /><br />Am I thrilled with the product - No!!, Satisfied - Yes!!  So, if you are someone who want a durable case that gets the job done, this might be for you.
B009B1UZ7C|1.0|I can't get pass the cigarette! Give me a break is the cover an ad for cancer, what an example your're setting already. You barely look sixteen. It doesn't look cool, lose the cig.
B0013LKFVO|5.0|This item has extended the use of a flashlight that I have owned for over ten years. It has brought an old flashlight into the 21st century.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Excellent character development. This is a fast read but the details seem to be in all the right places. Kind of a warm mystery, which is unusual & I think what makes it special.
B009X00E18|4.0|This cover is just about perfect for my 8.9&#34; Kindle Fire. Only reason no 5 star is it is more difficuilt to get it standing up with this case then it should be. But overall I am happy with it.
B00B23O96A|5.0|I can't understand anyone bashing this album as so many have done on here.  Unless you think its 40 years ago and Derek and the Dominoes and Cream are the only things Eric is allowed to put his talents to, maybe.<br /><br />A true Eric Clapton fan will LOVE this CD.  His voice is in fine form, the music is true MUSIC, played by talented musicians (led by EC himself, of course) and I think the song collection and mix of it is cool.  The old songs are classics that I love and I love that he does too, apparently.  The new songs are great.  There's not one song on here I'd skip over.<br /><br />When I pop a CD into the Bose, this is what I want it to sound like. This is going to end up being one of my very favorite Clapton albums ever.  Get it.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey Stirling's work, both her own creations on this album, and her covers available separately on Amazon and elsewhere, are an amazing treat for your ears.  Her violin work is excellent.  Find her videos on Youtube and watch!  It's unbelievable that she can play that consistently while moving the way she does.  This album has been a repeating soundtrack for my current deployment in Iraq - it's been a great way to get my head out of the cares of the day and relax.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|These Lavalier Microphones are the best deal going! They give a nice clean audio when broadcasting. I will buy more of these!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|not as good as &#34;alien&#34;, but an ok movie. Definitly worth a watch, but glad I didn't spend the $ to see it in the theatre. Ties into the alien movies, kind of a prequel. Very similar to the alien movies though, not much has changed in terms of plot.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Great game, if only it wouldn't stop in middle of playing, take coins spent but give no credit for game. Keeps restarting on me more games than I can finish playing.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Not a great movie.  Similar to &#34;Priest&#34;, not great anywhere and a boring and predictable ending.  Silly premise but ok, I can accept that. But overall not great and not very original.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love ehht a lot of ppl are talking s*** but it works great on my kindle fire and kindle fire HD ok
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is very good just like the rest of Rick Rordans books. I can not wait for the house of Hades.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What is there to say after a book like this? So much has already been said.  I could activate my English degrees and analyze this into some explainable meaning,  I'd be missing the point. We each have to choose the story we prefer.  I know which one I choose.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this is the second time I've played this. I will just say one important thing about this game...MORE! !!!!<br />Very good story ho-s and mini games. I absolutely love it.
B00C94JRWW|1.0|I can't really tell you how the product (Vikings: Burial of the Dead) was, because I never saw it.  Originally we're told that it could take up to 30 minutes.  45 minutes later, when we looked, we were told it would be 51 minutes.  Next time, 5 hours.  This is not the first time this has happened, but I'd forgotten about the excessive download time.  I will never be fooled again into getting an Amazon digital download.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I already knew about hormones, steroids, and new difficult strains of bacteria and e-coli in meat.  What I didn't know was how cleaner methods could be employed for very little cost.  It's also surprising how much corn is in processed foods and it's role in obesity and diabetes.  But what bothered me the most was the Monsanto corporation's ownership of patented seeds that come from a privately grown plant.  It should at most be a 7 year patent like medicines.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this very good time passer..must have on ur kindle ..lay in bed and play..woo hoo..makes me feel like I'm at coney island arcade ..lol
B003PBB4ME|4.0|This is a good holder for taking video.  The only complaint I have is the tightening screw that keeps your camera on the base.  It is a bit difficult to get tight so it does not really keep your camera from spinning on the base of the holder.  But if you are careful it should not be a problem.
1400052181|5.0|Once you get started reading this book you won't be able to put it down. The author draws you into the web of becoming familiar with the characters and then you're trapped! into wanting to know what's going to happen next! Then the way she transacted her<br />research solidifies the story.  I've worked in research for two years and everything she noted touched home with me, from the IRB, to the pipettes, and the pitree dishes! Just marvelous!
B00BUL0XYG|5.0|I sympathize with those who were expecting one thing and got another. I can't count how many times I've been let down. With that said, anyone who rated 3 stars or below is wrong. This album is f'in great.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Love the game but not thrilled with the review to play the last Lvl part.  even if I get to play it then.  I hope so.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Bloons TD5 is a great tower defense game.  The monkey theme is fun and the gameplay is top notch.  It offers no ends in terms of challenges.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Just finished the book and enjoyed every minute.  Had a different outcome than I had expected,but an interesting one. Different story from Grishams usual books.  Will lok forward to his next book
B00AKO93JK|5.0|The Daily Workouts bundle is a very useful app for those looking to start/continue to exercise.  They come with three different workout routines within each section and there is a combined workout that includes aspects of the individual workouts into one giant workout.  I still prefer to do each type of workout separately because in the end it is a longer workout, but those stressed for time and want to do more than just, lets say abs, can't go wrong with the combined one.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I downloaded this item on my Kindle Fire so I can try our my new wireless Brothers printer.  The App was cumbersome to use since the folders does not specify the type of file/document and you cannot preview the document before you print.  I would re-install this App if at a minimum if I can preview prior to printing.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Plague Inc is a very fun strategy game where you are a disease and your goal is to kill all humans.  A somewhat disturbing and surreal premise, however the gameplay is very fun and it's an engrossing game,

B007STXHTM|5.0|As you may know if you are looking at a dive housing the original GoPro Hero 2 case, while waterproof, does NOT allow for under water pictures or video.  The curved lens distorts pictures.  Utterly worthless!  Honestly who makes a camera case safe to 160' and forgets to let you take pictures with it?<br /><br />GoPro fixed that problem in the Hero 3 with a flat covering over the lens.<br /><br />This Dive Housing is an absolute must if you have a GoPro Hero 2 and you want to take underwater pictures.  This case is well made and a decent price.  I have not purchased the red filter for it yet because I haven't gone deep enough to need it.  At least this case works, keeps the camera safe and lets you take pictures/video.  Everything the original Hero case should have done from day 1.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome and I love it! It just needs some of the Redstone stuff and nether and the game will be perfect!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this through and really loved it, so I thought I would see the movie. The book was so much better than the movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|As my title indicates, the book is good and I was truly interested. The end is a bit dragged out, it could have ended without the extra few chapters being so full of details.
B00A77II0U|5.0|If you like hidden object games you will love this one.the puzzles were not very hard but the storyline was very entertaining. Loved the ending.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard alot about the show so I decided to watch a few episodes. I wasn't sure about the show at first but I found myself becoming addicted! Definitely recommend it to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a must get game! its awesome its cool its fun its.........my horse ! for horse and other animal lover's only
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book shows you the other side of the air war.It shows you not every pilot was the bad guy.This book is worth the time to sit and read it.
B00CBXV96I|5.0|In most crime fighting shows its a one episode crime with a lot of dark comedy and drama but in Hannibal its the real thing with intense moments of realism. Will Graham and Hannibal have the best times in the show, even though I couldn't at first understand Hannibal's voice, he makes for a good badass villain. Ontop of Bates Motel this show is awesome.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Denzel Washington is truly a remarkable and talented actor.<br />I know he takes challenges of portraying very dark and distrubing<br />roles.  His character was very raw and harsh.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Poor, poor Tess.  This is a very good adaptation of Tess of the D'urbervilles.  With Eddie Redmayne as Angel how can one find any fault at all!?!?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderfully thoughtful. Perspective on death, living and love is refreshing.<br />I can't wait to read more books by this author.
B00AEFYCL4|4.0|This was what I expected, and was delivered in a decent time frame. The product wa snew, and in new condition. I had read this book, and the movie was recommended too. Nicely done - thanks!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is fun & challenging. I tend to die a lot but I like that we can buy upgrades with coins earned in the game.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|It has great graphics and hours of fun to keep just about anyone busy while seeking a retreat from boredom.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book...you will not be disappointed! It is very thought provoking.  It may ask all you parents...what would you do?
B000YDG5W0|5.0|I spent January to April in Moscow, Russia.  Right before going, my wife convinced me that I needed a pair a boots.  Despite some of the, perhaps, negative reviews, we decided on these.  They were perfect.<br /><br />They, as all the other reviews say, run a touch big.  But that was perfect for wearing heavy wool socks (plus my feet are a little wide).  Of course, by themselves, they would have been cold... But for this trip (mind you we were outside for extended periods of time in weather around -10 F), they were perfect.<br /><br />My feet never got wet in either the snow or the spring slush.<br /><br />Of course, the bottoms were a touch slippery on the ice... But that is because ice is slippery... I don't know what else you would expect.  I wore them almost every day and they show almost no signs of wear.<br /><br />I was very impressed and would recommend these boots as a great winter/spring boot.  We'll see how they hold up this summer hiking.
0807014273|4.0|Years ago, I read Thomas Kenneally's novel, Schindler's Ark [later used for the movie Schindler's List]. In the book, I recall a conversation in which two prisoners discussed suicide. One of them said, 'Don't do that, you will never know how it ends.' I thought of this conversation when I read Man's Search for Meaning.<br /><br />I saw this book in a Christian bookshop display. According to the cover, it has sold 9 million copies - a massive bestseller, yet I had never heard of it. The bookseller told me that there was little demand for it generally but it always sold well when he put it on open display in the shop.<br /><br />The writer, Viktor E Frankl, was a Jewish psychiatrist from Vienna who was incarcerated at various Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War. During this period, he was employed as a road builder and medical orderly and did not suffer the ultimate fate of extermination in a gas chamber unlike his wife and parents [his sister had mercifully been able to emigrate to Australia before the War started]. The main part of the book concerns Frankl's experience as a prisoner - a story told in a matter of fact quite unjudgemental way. There are moments of reflection and often grim gallows humour but little bitterness or resentment about the sheer injustice at his treatment - the prisoners were after all innocent men and women.<br /><br />During his imprisonment, he noticed that many of his fellow inmates who were not destined for execution still gave up life through depression, suicide and typhus - indeed for many, extermination was a release. Paradoxically, these people were often the more sturdy prisoners. The idea came to Frankl in a discussion with another prisoner who, while dressed in filthy ill fitting prison clothes wondered what his wife would think of him dressed like this. Frankl considered the same thing and the constant thought of his wife [both the memories of their pre-War life together and speculation on her present state] kept him in a more positive state. It made him realise that if people have a life purpose and meaning, it can give them strength to survive whatever misfortunes they may experience in life. He quotes Nietzsche, 'He who has a why to live can survive any how'.<br /><br />This philosophy informed Frankl's post-War psychiatric work in which he developed a field called logotherapy, in which patients get over neuroses they may suffer through developing an appreciation of their lives' meaning. I found this an interesting topic that has made me more appreciative of what I have in life and the experiences I have had. The chapter in which he explains it, 'Logotherapy in a Nutshell' was perhaps a bit hard to read but it well worth reflecting on.<br /><br />Very good book.
B000JIHP88|4.0|She is almost a year and still loves it ! :) The Batteries last very long as well. I would highly recommend this ! :)
0545265355|5.0|Its true the books are amazing and its best to buy them together because once they sick you in you do not want to put them down.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|Unfortunately, the series prior to this book left too many plot lines dangling in favor of finishing the series. There was very little transition from all the previous plots to the last battle scenes. I was sorely disappointed to find many of these plot lines just swept away by the pressures of the last battle. I was also less than thrilled with Rand's role in the book and his final fate. There were just too many inconsistencies introduced into this book, compared to previous books, in order to make the plot line work that I can't rate it higher than three stars. Other people may find the discrepancies to be perfectly acceptable. The one that I find the least acceptable was the change of the Forsaken from being capable of defeat to god like omnipotence. There were other inconsistencies that were glossed over or ignored altogether.<br /><br />In essence, if you are the type of reader that tracks little things throughout a series or book, you will find this book wanting but not bad. However, if you are a fan of epic fantasy with the ability to gloss over minor details, you should find the book satisfying.
B00130VLZ4|5.0|Quick and easy to take camera out for a quick shot. Took it with me to Mexico and it was just so convenient.  Way better than the other cases that do not accommodate the camera's own strap.  It also protects the camera.
B0081X40HW|5.0|I absolutely love Haley Reinhart. I'm so sad that she got dropped from her record label, because there's nobody else out there who sounds like her. I listen to these songs all the time.

B007HC3LHS|4.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to like this book, because I'd never heard of it or the author before, but I ended up getting really into it. The way that the book was set up, it was super obvious to me that Cathy's (2008) story was leading towards a big event. Throughout the entire book, leading up to this event, I was worried that it was going to be super predictable and I wasn't going to enjoy it.<br /><br />I think that it was really obvious what exactly was going to happen (at least to me), but I won't give it away. I think that the author did it really well, and I was pleased with how the book progressed and how it ultimately ended. While the event that I was anticipating did happen, it was a lot more involved than I was expecting, and I was surprised by some of the things that were revealed in the end. After finishing the book, I found myself appreciating the author's method of giving the reader hints as to what was probably going to go down in the climax of the book. Because I was waiting and waiting for this big thing to happen, it made the lead-up to it even scarier. It was like the scary music that they play in horror movies right before the big &#34;BOO!&#34;<br /><br />This book was pretty creepy in general, though — not just at the end. I found myself getting a little scared while reading it late at night when I was the only one awake, although I do admit that I scare pretty easily when it comes to those things. I don't even know if scary is the word for it. It was just really, really.... creepy.<br /><br />Both of Cathy's stories really resonated with me. Having been in two abusive relationships in the past, I was really nervous to read a book on this topic. Parts of it really affected me, because of the flashbacks that it created, but I thought that the author did a really good job portraying what it's like to be in that kind of relationship — even though Cathy's was way more extreme that your average domestic violence situation.<br /><br />I really grew to love Cathy's character throughout the novel. I was very attached to her and I was really rooting for her the whole time. I was so proud of her for the steps that she took to deal with her mental and emotional problems, and I totally fell in love with her neighbor, Stuart. I did feel that some parts of it dragged, but I stayed interesting and invested throughout the whole book.<br /><br />The only fault that I really have with it is that there was really no resolution being Cathy and Stuart's characters at the end of the novel. While we find out what happened to them, the end of that storyline felt very lacking and kind of rushed. We spent so much time getting to know their characters and their relationship, that I felt cheated by not getting to really see how they ended.grew to love Cathy's character throughout the novel.

B00C4SUEJI|1.0|Once again Sam Beam seems to keep getting further away from his original sound.  Can't force myself to purchase this album even though im a huge \\"early\\" Iron & Wine fan.  I hope he takes a step back on his next album.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I loved it.  I thought it was very entertaining and I just loved the ending. I think every couple who has been married for any length of time and have become too accustomed to each other should watch this movie.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore & Ryan Lewis really surprised me with this album. Was a huge fan of &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; when it came out for it's unique sound, catchy lyrics, and overall ridiculousness. Wasn't sure what to expect from a full album, though I can confidently say my expectations were far short of what &#34;The Heist&#34; delivers. &#34;Same Love&#34; is a standout, with thoughtful lyrics and a powerful message.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Doesn't work perfectly on my SGS3, scores always show you 0, and the enter key does nothing, so you have to use the keyboard enter key. Overall fantastic game, well worth the price.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|Bruno's sophomore offering follows the same formula as his first effort but, in my opinion, fails to expand upon his signature sound. Still worth the listen but don't expect anything groundbreaking.
B0094K1K42|4.0|Something a little different and interesting for once! I'm glad I watched it and it didn't end happily ever after.
B0086HGW42|4.0|Always liked &#34;The A Team&#34; but was never motivated to check out Ed's entire album. When I finally did give it a listen I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of mellow and upbeat. Overall a solid album from start to finish. &#34;Drunk&#34; is definitely a favorite.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|The beginning of this book will most likely have you thanking your lucky starts you have a job among competent folks.I was beyond amused at the activities of Finley & Figg. Everything that had to do with that law firm will bring loud outbursts of laughter. (Expect strange looks from family, friends, and surrounding individuals.)<br /><br />The only thing I found not amusing was the tragedy of the Thuey.:'( One of the few types of lawsuits that are actually justified.<br /><br />I absolutely loved David Zinc and thought he was a blessing to that pathetic excuse of a \\"law firm\\".(Chuckles) I felt for the guy from the moment he left that prison of a law firm.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book thoroughly and completely with no fault found anywhere!! A MUST READ!
B009EANE3M|4.0|Another solid album by The Script. If you're a fan of past releases and their overall style you'll enjoy #3.
B000050HF1|5.0|The original &#34;JC&#34; at his best - I love this album and listen to it often.  Vinyl really does his music justice.

B00000J048|5.0|I used this for a presentation I was giving on Proposal Development.  I wanted to illustrate how are the teams on a proposal had to work together to achieve success.  It was a great ice breaker and the two teams I had were actually competing to see who could do a better job.  And these are adults!  Afterwards, I gave it to my grandchildren who enjoy it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not exactly thought-provoking, or had anything original in it, but time spent on it was not regretted about later. :)
B0063M22QO|4.0|It challenges your eyesight more than anything.  I have a 3 dimensional version on my PC tablet that is more interesting, but this works when you just want to relax.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I got the disc a couple days after it was released and it was worth the wait of pre-ordering! I absolutely love this band as is. There are no problems with anything! I would absolutely go through them again!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It's mindless fun.  Success depends on your speed in finding 3 contiguous blocks. Good when you just want to veg without being challenged much.
B000P0J06K|4.0|I got the movie very prompt and see that the disc is scratch free. The case came in with a huge gouge in the corner. As long as the disc stays in place it should stay damage free.

B000P0J06U|2.0|The disc came very fast, but there's writing on the case of the disc and the disc has quite a few scratches. I haven't tried the side with the decent scratches, yet but we shall see.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I love this game... it appears that I only have two more scenes to go through.<br />I'm having so much fun with this.  I don't want it to end.  Alawar, you have to make more just like this.  This game has kept me so occupied.  It's a lot of scenes, and then there's the mirror scenes.  I've been playing for awhile too.  I like that.  Please make more like this, it's the best.<br /><br />Thank you for this one
B004AGI2L4|3.0|It was decent.  No new take on the issue, not ground breaking. I would compare it to gladiator or 3000.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was definitely interested in what happened next but it wasn't what I expected.  I also thought it was very long & a lil drawn out @ times. So it did keep me tuned in but I was slightly disappointed due to the reviews.  So I gave a 3 for suspense... but different strokes for different folks! This was just not my favorite.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|The Ghoulish Swedes return with a fascinating, strange second album and it lives up to its name, \\"hostile\\"  through and through in its own style, an unholy marriage of pop, progressive rock, and hard rock. Very \\"Blue Oyster Cultish\\" at times. The identities of the band's members, remains a complete secret with their lead vocalist, who goes by the name Papa Emeritus II, the only distinguishable member of the band.<br /><br />I read...<br /><br />\\"Ghost B.C. ingeniously combine Satanic and occult-themed shtick with hard rock that centers on hooks rather than riffs, Papa Emeritus opting for smooth singing instead of bombast. Rather than going out of their way to sound evil and shocking in a typical, extreme metal sort of way, it feels more subversive to win over an audience with a catchy melody before they notice the snappy little track they're bobbing their heads to is actually about swamps of feces. It's like luring an audience who expects Beetlejuice only to show them Sal&ograve; instead, and this band is in devious form on the new album.\\"<br /><br /> \\"Papa Emeritus II (the only one of the Nameless Ghouls to shed even a vague semblance of calculated anonymity) has tempered his vocals a bit, more often sounding like Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues than anything that would qualify as metal... even in the 70's sense. There's also more than a hint of Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson here, particularly in the plaintive opening section of \\"Ghuleh / Zombie Queen\\", arguably the most interesting track on the album.\\"<br /><br />This album is deep, a Satanic epic full of hypnotic tones featuring a beautiful gothic sound that captures you and puts you in a trance.

B00BDSRFG0|5.0|Sweden's Spiritual Beggars began in 1992 or so as a side project of guitarist Michael Amott, well known for his work in such seminal acts as Carcass and Arch Enemy.<br /><br />\\"Joining Amott for Earth Blues are musicians with resumes a mile long, and with most of them with Spiritual Beggars since the band's early days. Bassist Sharlee D'Angelo (King Diamond, Witchery, etc.), keyboardist Per Widberg (Opeth), drummer Ludwig Witt (Grand Magus, Shining, etc.), and vocalist Apollo Papathanasio (now making his second appearance on a full-length album from Spiritual Beggars after a long stint in Firewind) are obviously well versed in their influences, and completely nail the sound of the era.\\"<br /><br />Dark lyrical lines, with really uplifting melodies makes \\"Earth Blues\\" a classic Rock album. They have a great mix of power and passion in their music, full of confidence, commanding respect.<br /><br />\\"Earth Blues\\" is an excellent album with great songwriting, stellar, very tight musicianship.  Songs vary from up tempo, riff oriented numbers to more melodic songs where Widberg's keys take the lead. The musicianship is super slick with Amott and Widberg leading the way with riffs, licks, and keys all in perfect harmony. There is a jamming mood throughout the 12 tracks of the album.<br /><br />\\"Turn The Tide\\" and \\"Sweet Magic Pain\\" features great guitar work and DEEP PURPLE-esque keyboards.<br /><br />The drumming provides the perfect pacing, and D'Angelo's bass has the necessary presence. Vocalist Papathanasio (Apollo) is a near dead ringer for David Coverdale and/or Ronnie James Dio, and almost eerily evokes memories of the era for those in my age demographic and older. The biggest part of the success of this album is hidden behind Apollo's singing.<br /><br />The PURPLE-esque \\"Kingmaker\\" and the early 80s-infused \\"Road To Madness\\" are the best examples to admire in Apollo's nailing his vocal performance, as well drummer Ludwig Witt's mastery of the skins.<br /><br />This album is a rock 70's throwback masterpiece. Earth Blues is a thunderous release that demands your attention. Imagine what these guys could do if this wasn't merely a side-project!<br /><br />In the end, Earth Blues is a near perfect album firmly rooted in the era, and you really can't ask for much more from a band playing in this genre.<br /><br />A big thumbs up for this release, 5 stars easily and let's see if anyone out there can top this one?s album is a rock 70's throwback masterpiece.

B009EJSUBY|5.0|The short answer is very good indeed. The full answer takes a little longer.<br /><br />Like many veteran listeners I never took Van Cliburn seriously.  I mean all that publicity, the competition, his rather pretentious, \\"cultivated\\" speaking style, etc. The critics weren't very positive about him either. As a result, the vast majority of these recordings are new to me. But now that all of his recordings have been reissued it's time for an assessment. So here goes.<br /><br />It's not accurate to say that Cliburn's recordings are paricularly uneven. Cliburn was a remarkably consistent pianist. In fact, you could say he played eveything more or less the same way (which I'll describe later). However, some works just don't respond well to the Cliburn Treatment. For example, when intimacy or atmosphere are required (as in, Clair de lune-- and in fact just about all of Debussy--Brahms' op 117/1 intermezzo, the first movement of the Moonlight Sonata) he seems wooden and ill at ease. In other cases (like the Brahms First Concerto) he plays as if the piece were by Rachmaninoff. But most of the works in this set fit him perfectly.<br /><br />Here are the main characteristics of Cliburn's playing.<br /><br />1.  Tone.  I've never heard any other pianist sound like this.  Only Rubinstein is even close. His sound is so large and rich it just fills the entire room. It's not a matter of volume; it's the sheer amplitude of his sound. He is incapable of producing an ugly sound on the piano. Nope, couldn't do it if he tried. You might argue that sometimes (as in the first movement of the Prokofiev Sixth) an ugly sound is required. But Cliburn is Cliburn, and the movement sounds positively gorgeous in his performance. Even when he sounds disengaged (as in the Chopin First Concerto) he is a pleasure to listen to. It should also be said that Cliburn rarely plays really softly. There are very few wispy pianissimos here (rather like Rubinstein). The tone is full and rounded at all dynamic levels.<br /><br />2.  Style. Looking around desperately for some adjective to decribe Cliburn's general approach, I came up with two: \\"stately\\" and declamatory.\\" His playing is very \\"public\\" (hence the problem with intimate music) and totally unruffled. He plays to the upper balcony. Tempi are often somewhat slower than usual, and he rarely speeds up to create excitement. Instead, the huge sound gets even more huge, and one is overwhelmed by the sheer size and amplitude. In fact, aside from all that publicity, it's hard to understand why he so excited the public. He's not a particularly \\"exciting\\" player (which is not to say he wasn't a great one). It's the grandeur of his playing that most impresses me.<br /><br />3. Clarity.  You want to hear each and every note of the piano part of Brahms' First?  Or Rachy 3?  Cliburn's your man. This clarity, combined with the steadiness of his rhythm, can sometime impart a \\"notey\\" (if such a word exists) quality to his playing.  Most often, though, the clarity and stateliness makes his playing uniquely \\"grand.\\"  ( I wonder if the great masters of the Golden Age--Cortot or Rachmaninoff for axample--sounded like this. We'll never know from the sound on their discs.)<br /><br />As for the specific performances, most of them are simply superb. Of the concerto recordings, the ones with the Chicago Symphony--Beethoven 4 and 5, Prokofiev 3 and MacDowell, Schumann, Rachy 2) are all great performances. The Brahms 2 is also pretty good. The performances with Philadelphia are not nearly on this level. The Chopin 1, Grieg, Lizst, Rachy Rhapsody all sound generic to me. The Tchaikovsky (perhaps the most famous classical music recording ever issued) is excellent, but the live Rachy 3 is a mess as a recording. (I have to admit there are very few pianists--Byron Janis one one of them, Cliburn isn't another--who can make this work sound like anything but junk to me. Some highlights: The superlative Chopin Sonatas, The liszt Sonata, Brahms Handel Variations are just a few of the treasures.<br /><br />Cliburn generally received excellent sound, which, given the beauty of his tone, is very important.  Most of these recordings are superb, paricularly the \\"Living Sound\\" recordings, which are often quite spectacular (listen, for eaxample to the Prokofiev concerto, which is breathtakingly clear and impactive). The recordings with the Philadelphia are much less impressive.<br /><br />These are, of course, cd \\"duplications\\" of the original lps, so recoding time is limited.  I found that oddly nostalgic.  At times I wanted to get up and turn the record over.  Don't try to read the liner notes without a magnifying glass.<br /><br />Cliburn had his ups and downs, but this set makes it clear that he was a really great pianist.

B003UBTX72|4.0|This is a great book on the history of the Rolling Stones, including a lot of information about the development of their sound and the personal relationships between the members of the band.  Don't expect to read a lot of details about drugs and sex parties, although they are alluded to.  This book includes Keith's interpretation of why the Stones were gradually becoming a group who were participants in Mick's band.  The Stones nearly broke up after this book was published.  They're going on tour to celebrate their 50th year in 2013, so I guess money helps to settle disagreements.  This is Keith's story, but I have a hard time doubting it when you look at the whole picture, or book, as it is.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|well packed 2 disc treatment of a classic movie. This movie touched my soul when I was a young child.  The film hasn't aged, I'm happy that Spielberg decided to revisit the movie 20 years after it was released and improve it using CGI.

B001QFZADA|5.0|This book is super interesting and makes you think about others and how it relates to the relationships in your life.  This books had been on my reading list for about 4 years before I actually read it.  I used to talk about the concepts with my ex-boyfriend, but he wasn't interested.  Reading the book made it even more clear why we had some issues.<br /><br />Anyway, I think it can definitely help people understand people and help build stronger relationships... or at least understand why some of your relationships are better/easier or harder than others.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is my new favorite author.  I've never read a book that was so wonderful.  The book centers around a senior in high school named Sky and her love interest, Holder.  It's hard to describe the main characters because their personalities are so well written and complex. Sky and Holder were funny and silly and heartbreaking and tragic and lovely.  Sky is a wonderful main character.  She's funny, sarcastic, and her imperfections are endearing.  She knows she's not perfect, but she accepts herself.  Sky, Holder, and Sky's two best friends are far from perfect.  They're honest to a fault and flawed in their own ways, but they're exactly the kind of people Sky needs in her life.  I couldn't put this book down.  I'm so glad that Sky and Holder's story will continue in book 2.

B000001ELP|4.0|This was ONE record by Kiss that I was never familiar w/ even though I have always seen this album around, since 1981, when it was first released. Out of curiosity, I bought this album from Amazon.com, on March 29, 2013. This music is a lot DIFFERENT from all of Kiss' OTHER music.  I would definitely RECOMMEND this album.  I would also like to offer my review each song, as follows:<br /><br />1.  \\"Fanfare\\"...I really LOVE this instrumental & I also LOVE the Gregorian Monk Chant @ the END of this song.<br /><br />2.  \\"Just A Boy\\"...This song is good & I like it.<br /><br />3.  \\"Odyssey\\"...Another good song.<br /><br />4.  \\"Only You\\"...Another good song.<br /><br />5.  \\"Under The Rose\\"...This song is definitely my TOP FAVORITE on this album.  It is very haunting & it is the MOST memorable song, in my opinion.  Others have compared THIS song to Pink Floyd or even Rush.  MUSICALLY, to me, it can sort of remind me of \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\" by Bon Jovi.  Well whatever, I just love THIS song.<br /><br />6.  \\"Dark Light\\"...I like this song, it can remind me of something that came from 1979's \\"Dynasty\\"<br />music, as Ace sang 2 or 3 songs from THAT particular album.<br /><br />7.  \\"A World Without Heroes\\"...I like this song, it's pretty good.<br /><br />8.  \\"The Oath\\"...This song is pretty good.<br /><br />9.  \\"Mr Blackwell\\"...This is my LEAST favorite song on this album.<br /><br />10. \\"Escape From The Island\\"...This is ANOTHER instrumental & it's a very good song.<br /><br />11. \\"I\\"...This a very good song, too.  I like it's meaning.<br /><br />Once again, this album may be a lot different, but I do like it. And it's recommended!

0741470314|5.0|Farther than I can remember, I've never been a \\"fan\\" of anyone. While I liked and appreciated singers, dancers, actors and famous people who have eachin their own way enchanted my childhood's universe, teenage years and adulthood, I have not been part of those who ran after an autograph, a photo or a concert not to be missed ... But I had my own way for Love.<br />Who does remember the Jackson Five, those wonderful little boys who have revolutionized the world of music ?. They were all amazing and talented. But life is probably unfair ... one of them caught the eye of the World : Michael was born, never to disappear !.<br />Life has passed and the time has passed ... too fast where happiness and joy are in our lives, too slow when there are troubles and sorrows to bear.Michael had everything too, the joys and sorrows and probably to a power that we cannot imagine ...<br />The happiness, joy, grief and sorrow have also punctuated my life and I did not follow the daily life that Michael had to endure. I listened to his music, admired his incredible dancing, I know his great compassion for the world and I let him live his life as every human being has the right to simply live.<br />When Michael left us on a beautiful June day, as suddenly, as inevitably ... Yes, I was upset, to such an extent that I did not understand what was happening to me and I looked around me to seek who could understand and help me. Nearly four years later, for me the mystery was cleared up a bit and probably this upheaval was also part of my innermost being.<br /><br />The Music, the Dance of Michael are Eternal. The World recognizes the Artist and Humanitarian, but the Man he was, the Human Being remains tarnished by the dirtiest accusations that he was the victim of more than fifteen years. Everyone knows that the \\"rumor\\" is a terrible thing that spreads like wildfire, feeds over the years and continues across time.<br />So today it is more important than ever to defend the Human Being to theEyes of the World. If you, Karen, through your book \\"Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy\\", Thomas Mesereau his lawyer in 2005 and if we all, together, unite our forces, our energies, our voices, we can succeed and make finally known to the World, the Truth, the One Truth of Michael so that he can finallly sleep in Peace for Eternity ...<br />Infinite Tenderness, Michael<br />Sylvie

B00C5ZORES|3.0|Well, after hearing that Fall Out Boy had returned after a hiatus for several years, I was intrigued to hear what they had to offer.  I used to listen to these guys very fervently throughout high school and my early college years prior to their hiatus, and so I figured I'd give this album a shot.<br /><br />Ultimately, I must say that this album is a mix of tragedy and triumph.  On the tragic side of things, Fall Out Boy seems to have been so eager to seek maturity that their trademark sound has been largely thrown aside.  Instead, it appears that FOB has decided to take on a more R&B/pop sound for much of their newer material.  In many of the tracks, the production is too shiny, taking away from the band's authentic sound and talent, and the lyricism and musicianship appears to have taken on a more simplistic structure.  In short, some of these tracks may feel more at home on one of Usher's older albums rather than on Fall Out Boy's newest effort.<br /><br />However, there is also a sense of triumph here.  Patrick Stump's vocals have never sounded better, and the instrumentation is still good, even if it is not up to the level of their older material.  Also, Fall Out Boy has shown that they still have essence to them, and has not burned out or become stale like many of their pop-punk/emo-pop peers (Paramore, The All-American Rejects, Boys Like Girls, I'm looking right at you).  The songs \\"The Phoenix\\" and \\"My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark\\" are strong, fun, catchy tracks, and I could listen to them over and over again.  It was also pretty cool of them to feature Elton John on the closer of the album.<br /><br />So, ultimately, I have mixed feelings.  While most of the album's tracks make for decent or adequate listens, only the first two (and to some degree the closer) are true standouts in comparison to their older, more pop-punk/emo-pop-centered material.  But Fall Out Boy still has shown that they can keep some essence to them, and has managed to run aheadof most of the pop-punk/emo-pop pack.<br /><br />Final Rating: 3.5/5

B00270WH3Y|5.0|Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel are best known for the folk rock \\"oldies\\" they sung from 1957 through 1970, though the duo did meet up again periodically over the later decades. This 14-track collection spands their earliest work, providing the original radio versions of their recognizable hits, except for 4 previously unreleased live concert performances. All songs rated within the top 10 on the Billboard charts, excluding \\"Scarborough Fair,\\" which came in at 11th place.<br /><br />Classics everyone should know:<br /><br />#1 \\"Mrs. Robinson\\"<br />#7 \\"Scarborough Fair\\"<br />#8 \\"Homeward Bound\\"<br />#9 \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\"<br /><br />This album is a great value. Purchasing the famous S&G singles separately can cost nearly as much, so why not educate your ears with more popular 60s hits or endeavor to complete an already bursting oldies library.<br /><br />Other albums to consider:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00136Q4X2 John Denver's Greatest Hits]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0078ZBXX8 The Unforgettable Voices: 30 Best Of Elvis Presley]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00125U25A The Best Of The Monkees (US Release)]]

B00AF6B22E|2.0|Washington is a very good actor and he handles the drunken captain well. My concern is the rest of the story. The crash was not very realistic and seemed contrived to boost the action. If the reaction by the rest of the crew and his friends to a serious drug addict and alcoholic is anywhere near realistic then American air safety has a serious problem. The same could be said for the law enforcement and legal team. Captains like Washington need to be rooted out and put in jail fast and it was appalling that it was left to Washington himself to stand up and be counted. The world is not like that and this movie failed badly in my view by using such a bad script. Rent at best but mostly \\"don't bother\\".

0316017930|1.0|Reading the other reviews on this site it is clear that most perceptive readers are not fooled by the literary techniques Malcolm Gladwell has used in his book Outliers. That is, he has a premise - outstanding achievers are mostly a function of their environments, lucky breaks, and date of birth - and sets out to cherry pick \\"data\\" that supports it. His premise is right out of the lib-speak playbooks of Barack \\" You didn't build that\\" Obama and Hillary \\"It takes a Village\\" Clinton. ( Ironically, those are two people who are TOTALLY  products of their environments and the efforts of others to propel them to the top. He should've used them as examples.)<br /><br />What is aggravating about his book( I listened to it on CD) is that he presents his positions not as  interesting observational tidbits, or possible scenarios...but as his newly discovered Fact-Theory clearly supported by his heavily researched data.<br /><br />For instance, he is really adamant on claiming that unless you are born in January, February, or March you have almost no chance of being a professional hockey player...???...Just for laughs I looked up the Number 1 Picks in the last 10 NHL Drafts,  along with their birthdays - (2012) Nail Yakupov- Oct 6 ; (11) Ryan Nugent-Apr 12; (10) Taylor Hall -Nov 14 ; (09) John Tavares -Sep 20; (08)Steve Stamkos Feb 4 ; (07) Patrick Kane -Nov 19; (06)Erik Johnson Mar 31; (05) Sidney Crosby Aug 7 ; (04) Alex Ovechkin Sept 17; (03) Marc Fleury Nov 28 ; (02) Rick Nash Jun 16. Getting two( barely) out of ten doesn't seem like very supportive data. So much for that \\"Theory\\".<br /><br />And his \\"Theory\\" that Asians are better at math partly because it takes them only .25 seconds to think/pronounce certain numbers...while the same number in English takes .33 seconds (a whopping .08 second longer!) ...and because their ancestors planted rice, is almost laughable if you really think about it. And it doesn't explain why Asians in America and the UK , speaking/thinking inEnglish and generations removed from rice paddies also seem to do very well in Math. Also, IF Asians ARE so good at math why hasn't any Asian country put a man on the moon? Or a spacecraft on Mars?<br /><br />And while I'm sure his mom is a nice woman who started out poor and made a nice life for herself, she does not qualify as an \\"Outlier\\" any more than tens of millions of other equally loved mothers who had humble origins. This was a self-indulgent chapter that should not have gotten by a decent editor.<br /><br />The whole chapter on Korean Airlines makes for a nice case study on Business Management Practices , but there were no \\"outliers\\" involved and it makes me wonder whether there even was an editor for this book?

0553804677|5.0|I have (and continue) to recommend this book to friends with few reservations. I've even presumptuously gifted a couple of copies. I found it very well paced with good momentum in the main story balanced with actually intriguing or relevant interludes of back story or cultural context.<br /><br />The sequel, Red Seas Under Red Skies, is also very good. I hate starting a series to be disappointed after the first book. Lynch is not a one-hit-wonder.<br /><br />I will say that the fantasy aspects of Lynch's world are more subtle than some others. The world doesn't have crazy rules or very much that's unbelievable at all. There's some strange architecture and inexplicably weird sea life, but that's about it. It probably helped immerse me that it wasn't so strange, but the elements that were almost seemed without any real purpose.<br /><br />The Lies of Locke Lamora is a balance of drama and dark humor sprinkled with graphic violence. Give it a try.

B000005RPX|5.0|Made in Japan is one of the music bible books needed in every rocker's collection.  The masters of improvisation give you a great dose of pure rock and energy.  There are 3 cd's in this package, with a few song repeats here and there but all played uniquely different and uniquely well.  And after listening to all three discs, you will still be hungry for more Purple.  The original Made in Japan tracks were extracted from these shows.  Now you get all that and more.  This is the best Purple lineup in action.  It is 1972 and all cylinders are firing in this incredible machine.  There are no words to describe what Purple transmits during this era and now 40 years later these sounds still rock your core with the same force.  Great musicianship.  Deep Purple, is one of the best rock bands, and one of the best top ten LIVE bands ever.  All five members are equally at the top of their game here, and show you all that classical background and their unique conversion to Rock formula.  QUALITY ALL AROUND.  I wonder where Ian Paice got all the energy from.  He bangs those drums non-stop from begining to end and gives you a full those of his tribal style trademark.

B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|This is the finest series I've ever seen. The UK is way ahead of us for quality films. The characters are so real and believable, you feel like you know personally. Each has made their roles their own. The clothes, the hairstyles, furnishings arfe absolutely right on for the times. The events mesh together as life does. I cannot wait for Season 4 to begin. Definately 5*****
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely adored this book. There was so much raw emotion throughout the book it made it nearly impossible not to feel what Sky and Dean were feeling every step of the way. They found each other right when they needed one another most. I liked the \\"diary\\" format because it made me excited to get to the date that opened the first chapter to find out what was going on during that scene.<br /><br />I really look forward to reading everything Ms. Hoover writes from here on out. She did an amazing job!<br /><br />I look forward to

044661758X|5.0|I stumbled upon this book when I was looking for something new. I am so glad I decided to read it. I am hookded on the Harry Bosch novels. Love this character. I ended up reading all in the series.
0307592731|3.0|I think this is a great stroy about the human spirit and all that we, as humans can endure. I only gave it three stars because at times it got a little tedious and I felt it was too drawn out. it could have been shorter, and thus less repeticious. Nevertheless, it kept me reading on although, at times, I felt as if I was also ont he trail suffering along with her. Maybe, that was her intention. I emphatized with Cheryl but was also awed by her strength and determination.<br />This book is another testament of the power of the human mind and how much one can accomplish, against all odds. I would never have attempted anything like that, but then looking at her life, I guess that was the only way for her to become whole again, or as whole as one can become, after such a life, as was hers. I think the book can be used as an example of victory over adversity and pain.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved this book. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer. I have read all his books and enjoyed them all. Safe Haven was a drama and a mystery and I liked how the characters were intertwined.
0307279189|5.0|I chose this book in one of the bookstores in an airport. The &#34;hidden tribe&#34; was what captivated me as I always like to learn about different peoples and cultures. The running or race part would be, I thought, just an added bonus. Of course, upon reading the first page, which began with the writer's search for a mysterious American runner living int he middle of nowhere deep in the Mexican Sierra Madre mountains piqued my interest. There was no turning back. I had to buy the book. Needless to say, I spent the whole flight reading and continued throughout my few spare hours while taking care of my mother, and trying to get some swimming in the little island in Croatia. I would recommend this book to all who love running and to sport's enthusiasts of all types. It is so all encompassing dealing with the lost tribe and how they have survived the Spanish conquest. It is a treatise on running from a physiological perspective, the business of sports equipment, etc. etc. I was surprised at all that Christopher McDougall was able to include in the story, while at the same time making it interesting enough to want to read through all that. I only expected to learn a little about this hidden tribe. Instead, I learned so much more in such a thrilling and enjoyable way. Loved the book.
B000FA675C|5.0|The book was much more than just who done it type of fiction. The book's plot was intermixed with historical details that made the book far more than your typical collection novel. I could not put this book down,, its plot takes so many exciting and unexpected twists. Even if you dot normally read mystery thriller books this is definitely a book I would recommended to anyone looking for a great story that gives you some things to think about history and religion- wise. But let me tell you I have seen the movie after I had read the book I have to say that reading the book is more intriguing so once again I have to say, that I highly recommended reading the book because it will give you more then the movie...

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great book therefor I dare say a great idea for everyone to have. I believe is the most amazing and most grateful thing that anyone could have given to all of us that love to learn about the Lord and or would love to learn about him. Because we not only get to read it we also get to hear it. We also get to mark the verses and choose a plan to learned from it as well, there are some devotion that you get to choose,. I can tell you this; it is a learning experience that never stops. Because it is about the Lord is about the one who gave his life for us. The one, who love us no matter the faults, is about how we need to be in our Lords ways. it so grateful to be able to have this bible within our reach.. I highly recommend this bible to everyone and anyone that would like to know the lord more and keep him close at all times. I would also like to thank Amazon and Kindle Fire for giving us such a wonderful give for free.. God bless.. Amazing

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am about half way through this book. I love this book. It is very easy to understand in terms of energy and life. When we first learned to organize the scattered light waves and call it a laser we had no idea the applications it wouild have. The same is true of understand energy in regards to life. I am a biologists, teaching and learning about life on planet earth for at least, in this lifetime, 40+ years. I am very much into science and spirituality because of some outstanding, earth shaking experiences I had.  I discovered at least 40 years ago I could make clouds dissipate, little ones. I have done it many times and can still do it. I am interacting with the source field, it's an E-Squared thing. It was an experiment at the time, a do-it-yourself energy experiment. My knock your socks off experiences that so changed my views was recorded in [...]. , \\"Bit & Pieces of a Biologist's Journey Into Spirit.\\" I didn't have a NDE experience but I had an ODE experience an other dimension experience and it has led me to totally agree with the contents of Pam Grout's book E-Squared. Of course I have this extensive science background so I am working on the experiments and thus far 2 thumbs up.
0061950726|2.0|The basic problem with this novel, for me, is the lack of verisimilitudes in half of the novel, specifically the problem with the first-person narrator, a nine-year-old Irish girl, Niamh, who became orphaned after her family moved to New York City. She recounts what happened to her in the late 1920s and early 30s in a narrative that it so unbelievable, especially when one stacks this up against the best of first person narratives such as Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" The girl tells the story in present tense without the author having established early on whether she's an adult recounting the events of her past--what Harper Lee did with Scout (Jean Louis Finch)--or without establishing how this child would have learned the adult-like syntax and vocabulary. Here is just one example: \\"Two women in white blouses sit in front of black sewing machines with the word Singer spelled out in gold along the body, pumping one foot on the iron lattice step that moves the needle, tucking the thread under the foot and pressing the fabric flat.\\"  This is just a sample of sentences no child would have uttered/written.  While I am at it, here's another sentence: \\"On the mantel piece an ornate gold clock with a domed glass front ticks loudly.\\" The only indication of an education is that prior to her death, Niamh's mother taught her letters and words. In school mainly she read poems.<br /><br />The story is divided into two parts, the 1920s/1930s component set essentially in the mid-West and the 2011 part set in Maine. (So many novels published recently are set in Maine, including Elizabeth Strout's latest, \\"The Burgess Boys.\\") The 2011 third person component is believable, at least more so. Goth Molly, a teenager who has spent time in \\"juvie,\\" is in a foster home in Spruce Harbor, Maine. She has a really nice boyfriend, Jack. And she loves reading \\"Jane Eyre\\" which, by the way, is one of the links with Niamh.  (I have noticed how many recent novels have characters who are in love with \\"Jane Eyre.\\") When Molly steals a copy of it from the local library, she has to do 50 hours of community service. And is how she meets 91-year-old Vivian who owns a mansion with an attic. Vivian is not at all believable in many places with dialogue that she just would never have said.<br /><br />What a disappointment. It's a nice looking book by the way. But where was the editor? This is a very flawed novel.ve with \\"Jane Eyre.\\") When Molly steals a copy of it from the local library, she has to do 50 hours of community service.

0440245931|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much; the characters very interesting, and I was sad when one of them was killed off early in the story.  I did have trouble keeping track of all the names in the book - who were the good guys, who were the bad guys, who did they work for, etc.  As I read, I kept wondering what the significance of the \\"pelican\\" would be - it took quite a while to find out.  I looked forward to reading it and would recommend it.

B0073LWEXK|3.0|The graphics are pretty good but the game play is lacking.  There is an in game help feature to direct you to the next step that should have been replaced by more actual gaming interaction instead of 'I have no idea what to do our where to go because this game built a list of spoilers instead of working you through the next step via game play'.  If you like trying to guess what comes next without real clues you will like this game.  Yes some puzzles were too easy white others had me scrolling through the tips in frustration only to realize  I have to back track all over to change the season and retrace my steps to the other side of the map.

B00ARF92HK|5.0|I freaking love this movie.  It's far better (and I do mean FAR better) than the original movie with Stallone... better in every respect.  Better plotline, better effects, better acting, better soundtrack... one end to the other, this movie is awesome.<br /><br />Perhaps more importantly than comparing this movie to the original movie is the comparison to the actual comic. and in that, this movie takes the cake... in fact, I might argue that this is the best comic-to-movie adaptation ever.  The filmmakers were able to take the grimy, gritty, dark urban feel of the characters and the environment and even the dialogue in the comic and effectively translate it onto the screen.  It's difficult to do, extremely difficult to do *well*, and this movie has done it exceptionally well.<br /><br />I'm not super big on owning movies, since I have an Amazon Prime membership and mostly just watch all the free movies and TV that comes with Prime membership... But this movie is a major exception, and was purchased as soon as I saw it come out on Amazon.<br /><br />If you like action and dark humor and awesome guns and, in general, just a whole bunch of badassery, Dredd is for you.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Let me tell you about my left thumb. For my entire PC gaming life my left thumb has resided on the space key. Usually working one game feature, jump seems to be the standard. Of all of my fingers my left thumb was the sole single tasker. This made my left thumb very sad. Even the right thumb had a few buttons on the mouse to push. Enter the g13 and its thumb joystick. My left thumb now easily controls 6 programmable buttons(7 if you push the joystick down, but this doesn't work well for me)without ever moving more than a inch. &#34;SIX&#34; says my thumb! That is more than any of my other fingers. I have 6 macros set up there that I can fire off lighting fast! Talk about an ace in the hole. As for the rest of the device. It is a fine piece of equipment. Feels good, works good, and easy to use. After 2 months of regular use I do not have a single complaint. Simple fact is this thing will make you a better gamer.  **UPDATE @ 2years  Buy it. If you have 1 gaming style piece of equipment...this is the one you want. It turns your left thumb into a weapon of gaming destruction.

B003V40SGS|2.0|I watched this because of the amazing reviews on Amazon.  Having just watched it, I am pretty disappointed.  The movie has an early 1960's type of feel and what people wrote as being amazing special effects didn't compare to the special effects from Star Wars to Close encounters.  The floating robots looked terrible and their movements even worse.  The story line is also boring and predictable.  What is even worse is the background music which is annoying and sometimes not right for the scene.  This movie would be rated higher if it was done in the early 60's.  It would certainly live up to being one of the better scifi movies of that generation and the corny music and characters would be accepted but for a movie from the late 1970's, I expected better especially considering the reviews on Amazon.

0374214913|3.0|I really enjoy books that can bend genre into something entirely new. I've read several novels that manage to do this remarkably well, Robert Jackson Bennett's The Troupe and Audrey Niffenegger's The Time Traveler's Wife both spring immediately to mind. So when I read the blurb for Robin Sloan's Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Book Store I had high hopes that I had found another such novel, something I could recommend to my non-genre reading friends that might bridge the gap between their tastes and mine. Sadly, despite showing a lot of promise in it's premise and characterization, Sloan's novel seems to be a bit too clever for its own good and tuned out to be something of a disappointment.<br /><br />The synopsis from the publisher is as follows:<br /><br />The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon out of his life as a San Francisco Web-design drone--and serendipity, sheer curiosity, and the ability to climb a ladder like a monkey has landed him a new gig working the night shift at Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. But after just a few days on the job, Clay begins to realize that this store is even more curious than the name suggests. There are only a few customers, but they come in repeatedly and never seem to actually buy anything, instead \\"checking out\\" impossibly obscure volumes from strange corners of the store, all according to some elaborate, long-standing arrangement with the gnomic Mr. Penumbra. The store must be a front for something larger, Clay concludes, and soon he's embarked on a complex analysis of the customers' behavior and roped his friends into helping to figure out just what's going on. But once they bring their findings to Mr. Penumbra, it turns out the secrets extend far outside the walls of the bookstore.<br />My disappointment aside, there are some interesting things going on in Sloan's story. The protagonist, Clay, certainly typifies the over-educated, inexperienced twenty-somethings that have suffered from the economic downturn and find themselves adrift with little sense of direction. Clay's dissatisfaction with his life's trajectory is palpable, and his decision to throw his energy into the mysteries of Penumbra's bookstore and its odd collection of clients seems like the act of a man desperate for something to grab hold of. The romantic subplot suffers from a similar sense of desperation, where Clay is content to allow Kat to run hot and cold while he simply drifts about her in a loose orbit awaiting her pleasure. It might not be the most fulfilling plot line, but the authenticity of its architecture is undeniable. The banter between the cast is easy and natural and full of pop culture references that genre readers will find engaging. As a character study, Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore is a success. It's only when his plot starts intersecting with his big idea, that some holes become apparent.<br /><br />While going to great lengths to provide an air of mystery to the true purpose of the bookstore and the mission of Penumbra and his acolytes, Sloan fails to deliver much more than some compelling stage dressing. The puzzles are far too easily solved, with out much in the way of actual cost to any of the protagonists. The juxtaposition of ancient methodology versus the technological path is obviously the big idea that Sloan is fixated on, but that comparison, while interesting doesn't provide enough real conflict to the plot. Sloan seems to be saying why can't we all just get along, but gives little real reason that we should do so.<br /><br />Sloan makes some excellent observations about the modern world's dependence on technology. For example, readers are treated to an awkward virtual date between our protagonist and his love interest, and an otherwise brilliant character cannot operate something as low tech as a copy of the New York Times. But rather than make any real statement about how technology may not be the cure all for all the challenges faced by the protagonist in his search to unlock themysterious knowledge that Penumbra seeks, Sloan simply allows technology to provide the answer time and time again. While real paper books do play a role in the eventual uncovering of the grand mystery that Penumbra and Gannon's band of investigators, most of the riddles Sloan presents are too conveniently solved with the aid of modern technology. Dues ex machina play far to great a role in the solving of problems. Need to copy a book in a secret library with incredible security, look no further than the Internet for plans for a an easily smuggled scanner made of cardboard and portable cameras. Can't decipher the book, well why not have the vast computing power of Google at your disposal. Answers come far too easily to Sloan's cast, and because of that there is little satisfaction when the ultimate goal is achieved.<br /><br />Make no mistake, Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore is a quick, light and ultimately enjoyable read. But with so strong a premise, I expected far more than I received. Those looking for something with a little more substance and less magical hand waving should stick to Robert Jackson Bennett and the like. There's little water beneath Sloan's albeit appealing mirage.
0765365278|5.0|I ready enjoyed this book and can't wait until the second book of the series is released this fall. I \\"found\\" Brandon Sanderson by reading the Wheel of Time Series that he finished for Robert Jordan but have since moved onto to his other novels like Warbreaker, The Emperor's Soul, and Mistborn Triology.

0670026557|5.0|People can be divided into three different categories - givers, takers and matchers.  I think we have all known about givers and takers, but matchers was a new term/concept for me.  A matcher is one that \\"keeps score\\" making sure that their reciprocity is matched on a tit for tat basis.<br /><br />So the question is which style is most successful.  While we tend to think that takers are more successful, the studies show something very interesting.  Over a long term, certain groups of givers achieve greater levels of success than takers.  But not all givers - certain givers rank near the bottom on any measure of success.<br /><br />Adam Grant, the author, has written a very interesting and highly insightful book that looks into the differences between givers, takers and matchers.  In his book, he explores what makes certain givers more successful.  He also goes into great detail about why certain givers experience burn out and why they fail to enjoy the success that other givers achieve.<br /><br />Mr. Grant is a professor at the Wharton School of Business.  There seems to be a growing trend among professors - that of writing highly engaging books which appeal to the mass audience.  Mr. Grant certainly fits right in this trend.  The book is well written in a very conversational style.  It is filled with numerous stories based on psychological studies.  There are also many real life examples of givers/takers and matchers in action.  You will gain a very good appreciation of the benefits and pitfalls of being a giver, taker or matcher.  Actually you will learn how to adjust your behavior so as to maximize your success.<br /><br />This book will give you a new perspective on how to achieve success.  If you are running into roadblocks, you will very likely find your behavior patterns talked about in this book and you will find some very specific tips and techniques on ways to alter your giver/taker/matcher behavior to achieve the success you are seeking.<br /><br />The final chapter is \\"Actions for Impact\\" - ten specific things you can do to implement the concepts discussed in the book.  In this section Mr. Grant gives lots of online resources that are available to aid you in your journey.<br /><br />The book also has an extensive reference section that provides additional resources for those interested in further study.<br /><br />Highly entertaining and very insightful.  You will gain some very specific actionable knowledge that will help you achieve your goals.inal chapter is \\"Actions for Impact\\" - ten specific things you can do to implement the concepts discussed in the book.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|Written decades ago, this book continues to be as relevant now as then. Frankl writes from both a trained and studied mindset and from personal experience.<br /><br />If you are feeling lost, depressed, or without hope you will find the beginning of your path too healing here. I would recommend this book to those high school age or older because of the sensitive nature of some topics explored. Because everyone, sooner or later, struggles through challenging life circumstances this book would help everyone.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Downey is excellent again as Sherlock Holmes master of disguises.  This movie has action, comedy and alittle romance.  I would love to see a third Sherlock Holmes installment with Downey again reprising his wonderful role.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Like if you have never played flow, your life isn't complete! You need to get flow, you wont regret you choice! Oh, plus, its FREE!!!!!!! Please get F.L.O.W
B002R22PB6|5.0|Javier Bardem is the special kind of actor that no matter what role he has turns to gold.  He puts so much depth into any character.  I havent seen him give a bad performance yet.  It is not in his vocabulary.  There are very few actors out there that can portray a role with such excellence.  Kuddos.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|My 6  year old son just finished this book! He enjoyed reading it a lot and says it's one of the best books he has ever read!
B001DE29SS|5.0|This movie is not the usual Downey fare, but with his versatility, Downey once again pulls it off.  The portrayal of Chaplins life from little boy to old man is very interesting.  Didnt know Chaplin liked the YOUNG ladies that much.  I also didnt know he was married that many times.  The &#34;little tramp&#34; really got around.  Another good Downey performance.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|however,  I have also. used another app that is similar but has games that you play to wake up (like memory games)  I would like to see that here
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. does it again.  What can you say about a versatile actor like Downey?  Even the english accent is pretty good.  Another great role.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I cant stop playing.  Best game to play on a kindle.  Love it.  Now if facebook would have this it would be nonstop playing.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Pretty funny. Dont really get the bad reviews....it is a silly comedy people. Not high art.Relax and laugh. Its OK
B007JOM0GC|4.0|I had a deal for some albums and this was just one of the few I thought I might enjoy. I'm not a huge Katy Perry fan but some of the songs on this album are kind of fun.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This game is wonderful and challenging. It's fun and each level is interesting and not hard to play at all.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|AWESOME! I felt like I was in the battle myself. In truth I always wondered what it would have been like if every one of those planes face off like in the game.
B00BEL4Q90|5.0|Got stuck with this series from season 1. Deeply disappointed by Matthew's untimely demise. I thought I would see efforts to pull him out from under his wrecked car, but the end came up too soon. Two things: (1)If someone in power could talk the actor into coming back, I'd really try the rescue scene, plus uncertain recovery, etc. (2) Whatever happened with Shirley MacLaine's part? Could I possibly have dozed off when some explanation was offered on why she was gone after the second episode of season 3?
0312117337|5.0|My daughter had a reading from a woman who used these cards. That was a decade ago. Since that time, my daughter has hinted that she would love to own this set. On a trip to Santa Barbara recently, I found these in a cute little shop. Of course I bought them. WOW! These are so gorgeous and more important ACCURATE, that I have a hard time remembering that they are just the tools! We have done several readings with this fascinating deck, and my only complaint is that I didn't purchase them sooner. If you're on the fence about which tarot deck to get, do yourself a big favor and get these. I have multiple divination tools, and these are at the top of the list of beautiful quality tarot cards.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much. Worth the cost.  My only complaint is that it went by way to fast! Looking forward to trying another game by the maker!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I, and my kids, really love the new graphics and areas. In fact, all of the kids have beaten my socks off on numerous occasions.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|If you are looking for a solid RTS to try out on your man-portable console (read: Kindle Fire or 'droid) this one'll do. The quests build your facility with the timing, and you soon learn that combat ain't quite the focus. If you're used to the integrated, map-traversable war games for PC, you'll likely need some adjust time to get used to the combat board. Kinda like a cross between Crazy Climber and Fruit Ninja, the key is in the logistical effort b4 engagements. Realize you're building for the long haul, learn how to cross your supply facility nodes so lack of, say, oil keeps you from throwing down, or worse, energy, which is much tougher to come by. Or you could just throw $&euro;&yen;&pound;&cent; at it.<br /><br />But you really aren't that kinda gamer...&iquest;
B00AB7HESI|5.0|this is the best gane ever its all about your imagination!! all the levels will take you to various situations that you have to survive by typing in items or animals to help you survive!!! its awesome but dont get too addicted to it or you'll finish it in one day and won't be able to enjoy it for a long time:) GET THIS APP &cent;99 us SOOOOOO worth it!!!!! :D
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is facebook.  It's all the same as usual.  I do like being able to see Facebook on my Kindle fire
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I have \\"read\\" the audio book at least 3 times and bought the digital version just so I could see the picture she was talking about.  Tina Fey makes me laugh so her books are defiantly worth what I've paid. :)
B008L1DNGI|3.0|Interesting concept and fair puzzle game. does take time to load but will work on just about any droid system i have.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I gave this item 5 stars because it covered all of my needs- protecting the Kindle from dirt dust or drops and covering the Kindle in the skin of an old favorite leatherbound book. This cover makes it easier to hold the Kindle to read for long periods of time and warms slightly to your body temp, almost like you merge with it. I'm not sure if it is leather (not likely but maybe?) but it looks and feels fantastic.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|I am hard of hearing and subtitles are a necessity for me in order to understand the dialogue of any show, especially a show where the characters have a different accent from mine.  I had to buy the DVD for the subtitles.  Amazon, when will you learn?!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Real page turner, Baldacci is a master story teller. I can't wait to read the next book. I have read 12 of his books through the years.
B008602KQI|5.0|THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE, BOTH WERE GREAT. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE NEW MOVIE, IN THE SERIES. SHOULD BE GREAT!
0307346617|5.0|got it as a gift , great price , will read it when he is done with it . great
B0050SYS5A|4.0|Works great!!! Setup was to easy to use and I have the space to play and dance with my wife!
1400049628|5.0|its a book he has been wanting and great price and he loved it .. .. . .  .. .
B0086700CM|2.0|Its an okay game, but it is rather bloated and didnt support any android devices I owned.<br /><br />note to devs: armv6 is still alive and kicking. deal with it.
B001TY3LSY|4.0|...it could have been a one disc set and accomplished the &#34;best of&#34; requirement as well.  Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful set - and it's hard to claim &#34;too much&#34; of a good thing - but there are  several numbers that only require a single or double listening.  It's decently priced, though, so it's not any kind of a rip off - just more than you really ultimately want or need.  Dumb complaint huh?
B00B2166BS|5.0|exactly as described. works perfectly. Very well made. The magnets make a tight and secure connection, and if your 2 year old takes it off the table while charging o damage is done!
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|It will be nice if they specify in the reviews that is actually more a teen book.... The story is ok, but i found the book really boring!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Fast paced, good plot, twists and an easy, fun read! I'd give it a 4 1/2 STAR!  Exciting and believeable!
B00005Y46O|4.0|This cd of Free in live concerts is great-The reason I bought this instead of the Best of Free remastered was because there are 15 cuts on this instead of 12 on the best of cd.Plus I believe that a live concert has some different alternatives to a studio album(maybe just my take on it!)anyway the cd seems to be a good choice.Rodgers/Kossoff was a great combination back in those days!I've collected Rodgers from Free/Bad Company/Firm and he delivers!what a talent!!Happy listening!!Rock on!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Awesome app!!  I use this app everyday.  It is very reliable and easy to customize.  I especially like the way you can set the volume to start low and then get louder. Love it!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Bingo blitz is addictive fast paced fun but the computer glitches and crashes are frustrating and the response from support is slow or non productive.  If it weren't for that I would give this game 5 stars as it is the best of the bingo games in my opinion.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|This is an interesting and well made movie of human survival under extreme circumstances. It is, however, fairly predictable. Acting and cinematography are very good and Blu-ray video and audio are outstanding. That being said, in my opinion, it is a one viewing movie that will now be passed on to a friend.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Love the book and the concept.  Have been on the Fast Diet three weeks and have lost 3 lbs. (that is good because after 60 your metabolism slows down so much!)  It has certainly given me hope that I can lose the weight I need to lose.  For two days a week you can follow the plan knowing that you can eat regularly the other five - it is a win/win for me!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|An amazing sequel to the original with exquisitely detailed graphics and new upgrades. A must-have for fans of Temple Run.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|I really like this new album. Hospital for souls, Shadow Moses, and Can You Feel My Heart are my favorite songs so far(:
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|For those who like music this is a really fun & funny movie. The audience ranged from 30 - 65+ and everyone enjoyed it. It does have some inappropriate humor, so if that is a concern for you this may not be a good match. I loved it though!
