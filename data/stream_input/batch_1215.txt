B003IY49S4|5.0|Great collection of Jazz CD's from the 50's to the 80's. Very nice packaging with mini lp type jackets. The included booklet contains session and bonus track information. I purchased this along with vol 2 as well as the Perfect Blues Collection. 75 discs at less then $2 each. Any Jazz fan would love this collection.
0739366408|5.0|I had never read a zombie book, preferring to stay away from the horror genre.  I friend got me to watch The Walking Dead and I was fascinated, so he gave me World War Z to listen to.  I absolutely loved it!      The premise for World War Z is a fascinating one.  Brooks writes it as though he is chronicling the events after the fact, giving a history of the struggle between dead and living.  Each chapter bounces around from one person to another, whether it be a Chinese doctor, to a fundamental Muslim, to an American Soldier and so on.  Using this method you are shown every level of the war, from the ground level on up to the governmental structure and organization.  After listening to it I couldn't help but feel as though I were learning about a unique war that actually took place.  The zombies are fascinating, being the old school moaning and rambling type.  I particularly liked the Jerusalem chapter and the Battle of Yonkers.    The audio version took a little getting used to at first.  Each chapter is narrated by a different person, using the dialects and accents of whichever nation that person was from.  After you get used to how they are narrated it takes on a very unique feel, one that adds weight to the story and a truly international struggle.  By the end I couldn't wait to get back in to the car to listen to some more and was sad to have finished it so quickly.  Brooks writing style is easy going and relaxed, feeling as though you are sitting around a campfire listening to a story.    I can say I will be buying the book simply because the audio book is an abridged version!  Can't help but wonder what was left off.  I can safely say that I am a zombie fan now and am looking forward to reading other zombie books.  Definite recommend.    5 stars.
0596005903|5.0|I read this book in preparation for a contract job that involved porting a Linux device driver to another operating system. I already have years of experience in operating system design, and have written device drivers in the past. However, Linux has changed over the years, and I wanted to make sure I knew all the latest information.<br /><br />I certainly got what a wanted - this book helped me brush up my knowledge, with excellent details on the different steps required to implement a device driver, which functions to call, and what the various gotchas could be. I must admit that I read through the book fairly quickly (to get the high level view), and then re-read certain sections when I found that I needed more detail (as I proceeded to port the device driver).<br /><br />Some warnings though:<br />  1) This isn't a good book for anybody learning about device drivers for the first time. It assumes you already have a good understanding of the theory.<br />  2) If you want to write your own driver (which I haven't actually done), it seems to me as if you'd need to spend a lot of time going through all the examples, and typing them in yourself (that's the best way to learn). The material in this book is pretty heavy weight and it might time to learn. Of course, this isn't a reflection on the book, as much as it is on Linux itself.<br /><br />In general, a really good book, assuming you have the time to read it properly, and you already know the basics of how drivers work.
0143117009|5.0|I first read Collapse when it came out in softcover and read sections of it here and there, but I had a long reading list at the time and didn't spend too much time on it. Like Guns Germs and Steel, though, this book has a way of sticking with you. I found myself bringing it up in conversations all the time, so I figured I should go back and read it more thoroughly.    It's even more amazing than I remembered. Diamond is the best there is at combining history, geography, sociology and science to drive home a point. The sub-title really says it better than the title -- How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed. Our global society is headed for environmental disaster and there will be nowhere to run if we fail to solve out problems -- but calamity is NOT inevitable. Diamond shows how countries like Japan and Tikopia have created sustainable societies that have lasted thousands of years.     Since the book is about the impact of environmental pressures on societies, you might expect a big sign pointing to \\"global warming,\\" but actually it is hardly mentioned. Most of the book is focused on overpopulation and its effect on food production and deforestation. Historically, deforestation is the factor that led to societal collapse, and population growth led to deforestation in one way or another. Societies that overcome enviornmental crises are the ones that learned how to control population growth and manage forests.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I purchased this book because I had to for a Sophmore English class. I think it was very interesting and meaningful. However, I disagree that it should be one of the best books of all time. I do however, recommend reading it. Especially if you are debating following your dreams! However, being a female it was disappointing to see the way women were treated and depicted within the novel. Although, it was a good read and interesting. I don't suggest it to Feminists!
B001GKJ2FW|3.0|(+) it was shipped fast.  (+) it was shipped in an envelope with bubble wrap lining in it. content was great.  (-) it wasn't a blue ray official case (the blue kind). It was a black dvd case, with the mamma-mia cover. Since it was for a gift, I was saddened by that.    Overall good review. I'll read more specifically next time what kind of case it'll come in. If not specified, I'd ask first. :o)
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This movie reminded me of the 1950's monster/alien movies that I was raised on, with a hearty side of classic western thrown in.  Obviously, this movie has much better special effects than what was available in the 50's, but the tone and acting style of the film was what gave me that feeling.  The characters are believable, and any changes in character personalities were completely warranted.  There was one plot twist that I totally saw coming, but it didn't detract from my viewing experience.  If you're looking for a classic western story with a twist on the villain du jour, this is the film for you.<br /><br />Overall, it just had kind of a 'classic film' feel to it, and I am definitely looking forward to adding it to my collection.

B002OR0RP0|5.0|This is the only 1 of the Ice Age movies I will recommend. It has the typical Ice Age humor and adventure WITHOUT promoting macro Evolution. Sid feels rejected since Manny has a family of his own. Sid finds 3 eggs and \\"mothers\\" them until they hatch only to discover by the observation of his friends that the babies are dinosaurs and the mother comes looking for them. In defense of \\"his\\" babies, Sid gets carried away by the real mother with her babies to an undiscovered, unknown world of the dinosaurs below the Ice Age world. Sid's friends go looking for Sid and come across a new friend who guides them through the new world. All the friends go through adventures to find Sid and rescue him.
0553801473|4.0|After thinking a little I have to say that I liked ADWD. I liked AFFC too, but would have loved them to be only ONE book. That being said, I'm talking about ADWD now...<br />Arya, Theon, Bran, Barristan, Aegon/Connington and Jon 's chapters were a treat... they're all very well written and deep, they added meaning to the tale and lived up each and every of my expectations. They actually are what I wanted. As many pointed out, \\"sadly\\" the storylines all end at a cliff-hanger, but that's only to be expected, since we know there are at least another 2 oboks coming before the end.<br />But there are a couple of things I didn't like at all... the Tyrion and Dany chapters seem to be the biggest problem with this new instalment. It seems to me that both characters have \\"changed\\" in a way that is unsatisfying . Tyrion in this book seems to have lost all his cleverness and, above all, his wit: I think here he has never said or done one single thing worth of the Tyrion we've known so far, he seem to have become a real freak and he he doesn't care... all he's interested in is to find out where whores go. Ok, he did what he did to his father, but he seems to have done nothing out of it except becoming a very plain, dull and predictable character which is exactly the contrary of what he has always been to the bone (he never ever surprised me, he sometimes BORED me instead - and I say that even if I liked his voyage!). The same, I think, happens with Dany. She HAD ALREADY grown from a little scared girl into a dragon (or a dragonling if you prefer) but now she wastes herself in not making her mind up. Never. On anything! Ok, she's a teenager and I understand all she did with Daario (which is very \\"real\\" as teenagers are concerned) BUT... but all the stuff she went through in Mereen without doing ANYTHING about it is, imo, out of character. I remember Dany becoming confident, learning from whatever happened to her.... and learning to make the best out of even the worst situations.She had become, in a way, strong. But here she does NOTHING (except marrying a man... and to think that she married him to heave some weight off her shoulders is almost unbelievable for what she had grown to be!!!)<br />These, I think, are the real problem with the book: two major characters who don't quite resemble whom they have been ALWAYS, regardless of any situations they were put in. You may say now that people change. My reply is: yes, they change, but their DNA stays the same! And this is what I felt, that Tyrion and Dany's DNA have been changed without any \\"strong-enough\\" reason.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Give it up Lucas.   I'm starting to think you were lucky that FX technology was as primitive as it was when you made the original movies, because working with those limitations probably made the originals better than the your mental canvas allowed.  At least Spielberg has the humility to realize that the limited appearances of the shark in Jaws, due to problems with the mechanical model, led to a better movie.
0553801473|5.0|I have been collecting the Song of Ice and Fire series books for more years that I would like to remember. Each one is almost better than the previous (last one certainly) but the intervals inbetween books, the vast multitude of persons and the complications of the story make keeping track of the story very difficult. The lack of any summary at the start of the books is evident (in this the HBO TV series may help a lot!) making lesser hearts to lose interest in an ever spiraring gorgeous story. I do hope that the next book will complement the story although as it goes it seems that another one (at least!) is due to come too.

B0055S348W|5.0|This was a free App of the Day, but if you need to print from your Android device it would be worth spending the money to buy it.  I was able to print from my Nook Color running CM7 to my Canon ip4200 printer without a problem. I haven't tested the remote print, and not 100% certain how it works, but if it lets me print from my Nook Color to my Canon printer from anywhere that I'm online it will be the best thing since sliced bread. LOL  About time Amazon offered something other than a game or cookbook as a free app of the day.    Next day update:    The remote printing works.  My home computer and printer were on and I was able to print a PDF file from 5 miles away at McDonalds going through their WiFi.
0307272702|5.0|I think this book is excellent. It contains some things I already knew but lots of good information that I wasn't aware of.  It concentrates mainly on high protein - low carb lifestyle.  At the same time I was reading this, my husband was reading Dr. Ornish's book about the advantages of going Vegan.  So it has made for lots of good discussions at home.
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|Seeing Jessica Chastain in both The Help, and Tree of Life.<br /><br />Director John Madden directed Shakespeare in Love which won 7 Academy Awards including, Best Actress for Gwyneth Paltrow, and Best Supporting Actress for Judi Dench. He directed a favorite of mine, [[ASIN:B00003CXXG Captain Corelli's Mandolin]], starring Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz, And Christian Bale.<br /><br />I have also seen original movie [[ASIN:B0054SFJ5O The Debt  [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - United Kingdom ]]].<br /><br />In 1965, a Mossad agent played by Jessica Chastain, crosses Checkpoint Charlie and joins two male agents  in East Berlin, to identify and kidnap Birkenau's notorious surgeon, now a gynaecologist. Rachel is recruited not for her field experience but for her language skills. She must pose as his patient, allow intimate probings by hand and speculum, and take close up photos without arousing suspicion.<br /><br />Mossad agents abducted Eichmann in Argentina in 1961, tried him in Israel, and executed him. Notorious Dr Mengele, butcher of Auschwitz fled to South America, narrowly escaping capture by Mossad in Argentina fleeing to Paraguay, then Brazil. Birkenau as known also as Auschwitz Birkenau.  Twenty four surgeons performed unnecessary experiments on human captives, often without anaesthetic.<br /><br />Photographs of the surgeon's terrible deeds haunt her and fill her with apprehension and fear.  Photographs of smiling babies decorate his waiting room wall.  A man who once took life from the world, now charged with bringing life into the world.<br /><br />Her legs in stirrups, vulnerable, afraid,  as he probes her he asks probing questions, about her unfamiliar accent, her mother, how she found him.  It's weird, tense and gripping.  He gives her sex advice, and injections to help her become pregnant.  Meanwhile, back at the house her desire grows for the sensitive agent, who though attracted is closed off, and a romantic triangle develops. You may wonder if the doctors advice will pay off.<br /><br />As the mission goes wrong, three agents and their captive are forced to remain in same house.  He would rather escape than die, and rather die than face trial.  He senses weakness in the relationships of his captors, and in their psyches, and pushes their psychological limits.  He says shocking things. \\"You jews don't know how to live, you onl;y know how to die.\\"  \\"You are veek\\"<br /><br />As tensions mount, great psychodramatic moments unfold. It's strangely intimate. He finds Rachels weak spot and as she shaves him with a cutthroat razor in that strangely intimate way a girlfriend might shave her lover, tears stream down her porcelain cheeks.  He pushes David's weak button. She goes to the bathroom to throw up.  When David,the sensitive one replies, 'you are a monster,' you can notice from his facial expression that he gets off on it.  He plays them like violins.  'She is with him but it's you she wants.  When she kisses him she thinks of you.'  He reads her mind, guesses her real name, intuits her condition. These are the most absorbing movie moments.<br /><br />The doctor succeeds with his violent goal. They return to Israel, with an invented truth, and a heavy secret. Thirty years later that secret will force Rachel out of retirement, so real truth can remain secret.<br /><br />The Debt is part suspense, part thriller, part psychodrama, its parts stirred by three great acting performances.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain as the lead is incredible, with a face crafted by the cinematic gods, one of the best new talents I have seen. I was totally wowed by her performance. At a restaurant nights ago, no one at my dinner table knew who she was.  Pretty soon everyone will know who she is. She has four movies yet to be releassed this year. I  could not imagine anyone else doing this role as well, except perhaps a young Helen Mirren.<br /><br />Jesper Christensen delivers an astounding performance as the doctor, perhaps I am supposed to feel shock and outrage, yet I found it gripping and strangely delicious to watch the psychological cat and mouse game between him and her.<br /><br />Helen Mirren, shows a much harder edge as the older Rachel, always a gripping presence, and I would be surprised if she is not nominated for best supporting actress.<br /><br />I love movies with a heroic female protagonist.  When plans go awry, it is she who steps out of shadows looking for light, she who ventures into stirrups, she who fights. She feels the fear and does it anyway. She is an everywoman required to do dangerous things. Other movies with great female protagonists would be [[ASIN:B000TGCR38 Black Book]], and [[ASIN:B003YOZNAG The Girl Who Played With Fire]]movies. I wish Hollywood would make make more movies like these.  These are European movies.<br /><br />If you're like me, you may wonder what exactly is meant by the debt? Is it generational?  Is it karmic? Will the truth set us free?<br /><br />We can ask if there is a moral equivalence in entering another country to seize someone illegally so they can face a legal trial.  How legal would such a trial be? Let us remember there may be times when special forces need to go on a secret mission to find an elusive terrorist, perhaps in Pakistan, reponsible for thousands of civilian deaths, and a continuous threat.  Those who live by the sword die by  the sword.<br /><br />If you want to see original The Debt (subtitled), there are story differences.  In particular there is a scene where she shaves him, where he says 'why don't you kill me?' where she gives an interesting response, not in the remake. I prefer the more clear cut ending n the original.<br /><br />If you love this, recommend [[ASIN:B00005JOIH Munich (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] by Spielberg, an excellent thriller and story about Mossad agents responding to the massacre at the Munich Olympics which won five Oscar nominations including Best Picture, where Ciaran Hinds also plays Mossad agent, and Best Adapted Screenplay, and [[ASIN:B001PPLJIQ The Reader]]which won five  Academy nominations including Best Picture, and an Oscar for Kate Winslet, because both have thematic similarities, and [[ASIN:B000TGCR38 Black Book]], which I own, a Verhoeven movie.<br /><br />I don't think there has ever been been an Oscar given or even a nomination to two actresses playing the same character in the same movie.

B005LY4B0A|4.0|Simple to learn, very fun, very addictive. If you like cut the rope, you will enjoy this. It does become challenging the higher you go.
B003L77GGK|3.0|Overall, I liked Season 6 and as I whole, I think it had more solid episodes than Season 5, which had the better overlying storyline.  I think that more time should have been given to Soulless Sam, although I sort of get why they cut it short -- while I like Jared P. as Sam, he is not the best actor in the world and moving him to lead over Jensen A. hurt the show.  As a result, we wound up with an abbreviated subplot rather than an arc that could carry the season.  Another mistake was the Lisa/Ben/Dean story.  Everytime you thought you had seen the last of Lisa and Ben, they just kept popping up for no particular reason, since it was clear to all from the second episode, that the relationship was over, and it seemed like the nail was finally put in the coffin with \\"The Episode of Truth.\\"  It seemed almost as if the people in charge of the show liked the characters and could not let them go even though they made no inherent sense to the development of either the Dean character or the overall plot.  While I personally don't mind Dean actually having a love interest as a means of developing his character, in order for it to work the actors need to have chemistry together and Dean and Lisa did not. I also hate what was done with Castiel, but I am willing to reserve final judgment until this season before declaring that a bust.  The killing of Rufus was just wrong on so many levels as he added to the overall story every time he was on, and could have made a great companion/counterbalance to Bobby. I do however hope that the actor who played thee Alpha Vampire returns at some point because he was actually very interesting and well played.
B004T6IBNY|3.0|i would rate this 5 stars if there was much of a difference between the free and paid version, in the free one the ads arent a giant problem but its good theres none in the premium but there should also be some tables u can only play on premium. also it needs the western and brick tables
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I just finished watching Episode IV (A New Hope).  Although I haven't played any of the other discs, I dedided to go ahead and write a review, because some people may be wondering whether this is a good Blu-Ray purchase.  I think it is, so far.<br /><br />I was quite pleased with the video quality.  It is excellent, except for a couple of scenes of sand and blue sky, which have some grain (I sit about seven feet away from a 52\\" LCD).  Overall, the video quality is fantastic.  The aspect ratio is 2.35:1, and I am very happy for that.  The actual movie is just about 120 minutes.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 6.1 Master Audio soundtrack is also excellent.  Why they made it 6.1 instead of 7.1, I don't know, but it probably doesn't make a whole lot of difference.<br /><br />Luke's light saber is white, with blue edges.  Darth's light saber is white, with pink/red edges.  I have no complaints about the light sabers.  However, some of the explosions seem to be too orange (not like real fire).  Other than that, and the scenes that have grain, I saw no flaws.<br /><br />My first impression of the packaging was \\"Wow! This is a great way of packaging the set\\".  I really loved it, until I tried to remove a disc.  The only way I could figure to take the disc out, was to pinch the side of the disc and pull.  You shouldn't have to touch the playing surface to remove a disc.<br /><br />I debated starting with Episode One, but decided to start with Four because it is my favorite of the three original, and the main reason I bought this set was for the originals.  I originally ordered only the Original Trilogy, but changed my order to the Complete Saga, because I decided each Prequel movie was probably worth $10 to me, and the three bonus discs were probably worth another $10.  I have never seen Episodes Two and Three.  I have seen Episode One on DVD.  I didn't enjoy it that much, so never bought the other two.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am 1100% with The Maker. And with all the changes he did. Now all six movies are perfectly unified into one solid story. The mirroring technique (the Prequel trilogy mirroring the Original) works perfectly in the storyline. (By the way, I saw all the originals in the movie theaters-I AM NOT A NEW FAN. I love the original trilogy, the Phantom Menace, AND  Jar Jar). For all the vitriolic people, you obviously don't get Star Wars. It is not a museum item. When G.L. imagined it, he did not imagine it grainy and vintage looking.  Star Wars is forever...Star Wars is forever....
B0055JP7EU|5.0|This is the most amazing episode in the entire series.  I'm still crying as I write this.  I don't know how this one can be topped.  I'll be watching his episode over and over.

142311339X|4.0|First of all, I would like to say I'm a huge fan of Percy Jackson. This book was a thrilling adventure for me to read because it introduces three new characters named Piper,Jason, and Leo in a new conflict. The story leads us to the after part of what had happened after Percy had stoped Kronos and shows hidden secrets that were not mentions from the previous books. The book also introduces a new mystory on who Jasons is and the dissapearance of our beloved hero Percy Jackson. It also introduces new gods and enemies to the three new characters introduce. I would personally say that I like to read more about Percy Jackson but the story of the three new characters is still intressing because in their adventure, they still show us some of the greek mythology we love. The story introduces the connection of Roman god and Greeks being simular as well. I think it was a geneous idea of Rick Riordan to publish this book because it leads the story to a new start of a bigger conlfict. What I'm really looking towards to is to get my hands on the new book called \\"The Son of Nepture\\". This story will tell us on what had happen to our favorite and beloved hero Percy Jackson. Percy faces a new challenge from losing his memory and has to discover on who he truly is, this makes me really impatince on waiting for the book to come out.

B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Have to be honest ... when I ordered it (not paying attention) I thought there were two CD's ...sooo ...<br />'Twas a tad dissapointed to find one was a DVD.<br /> Not anymore.<br /> The energy & lyrics are so good - intelligent, positive, upbeat, infectious.<br /> Jason Mraz is one very talented person.<br /> Plus the horn section is so fine.<br />Two of my favorite segments: The operatic high notes he achieves with lyric \\"Live for tomorrow...\\" in song \\"Coyotes\\" (crank the volume for that) and when in the intro for \\"The Dynamo Of Volition\\" he says, \\"Don't ever let your mind keep you from having a good time\\". Words to live by, heh?<br /> It will get you up, out of that couch & you'll be clapping, moving, grooving, appreciating and, best of all, having a good time.<br />Trust me on this one.<br /> After two and a half years of reconstructive surgeries on both hips, the nursing home & wheelchair period and eventually rehab ...<br />THIS makes me<br /> stand up and dance(?). Well, you would be kind, very kind, if you refered to it that way.<br /> Anyhow, among other things, it is great physical therapy!<br />  Actually elevates my mood better, much better, than all those friggin' pills.<br /> ENJOY!
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|This us a fun movie to watch when you are alone and can acclimate yourself to a simpliar time in movie making. Loguns run has, for many sci-fi fans many infectious elements. Such as the audio sound in the background. The idea of all wearing the same clothes. If you liked \\"The Island\\" this is definitely its predecessor. Overall, this movie needs to be watched by people who like that quiet slow pace to a movie in any genre. \\"The World, The Flesh and the Devil\\", \\"Last man on earth\\", \\"The omega man\\", \\"Mad Max\\", \\"Rollerball\\",\\" Zardoz \\" and \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". Like \\"Star Wars IV\\", the characters are silly but likeable. Many of today's movies are outstanding on special effects, but the characters are sometimes more polished, but not endearing. The useage of extreme colors in set design and wardrobe. Again, if you did not grow up with these movies, you might not like Loguns Run unless you are a younger movies buff that likes to explore older movies and see their merit in what they were trying o convey. Some reviewers that saw this as a child and bought it are wondering why they ever liked this movie. Remember, we have all grown smarter and progressed. It takes more and more to entertain us. But, if you can sit back by yourself and not get distracted on a rainy day or late at night, you might start to look to buy more and more of these types of movies.When TMC does Oscar month and I start to watch old b/w movies I notice the overacting, the lack of pace etc. But, soon I am looking at the guide to see what other movies I have heard of that I never saw or the ones I have not seen since I was a kid. Give these types of movies their time.
B004LWZVZM|5.0|\\"The Conspirator\\" exceeded my expectations.  I read [[ASIN:0679450556 Robert Redford: The Biography]] this summer and am well aware of the ups and downs in Redford's career.  This film is an amazing accomplishment.  Dramatically, it brings us completely into the world of Washington D.C. in the final days of the Civil War.  For a movie that clocks in slightly over two hours, Redford keeps us riveted.  Robin Wright's performance as Mary Suratt is stunning.  She had briefly worked with Redford on [[ASIN:B00005JKNV The Last Castle]].  While the film may not achieve the needed buzz to generate an Oscar nomination, her performance would certainly warrant such recognition.  As Suratt, Wright is subtle and mostly serene, exploding only momentarily in the court room, \\"You lie!\\"  The quirk of impaired eyesight leads to Wright frequently squinting, which is addressed in the script well after she has established it.  I found her performance very moving.  James McAvoy does a sterling performance as Suratt's lawyer Frederick Aiken.  Makeup and period costuming disguise Kevin Kline's excellent performance as Edwin Stanton.  Evan Rachel Wood does a fine job with her supporting part as Anna Suratt.  John Callum who has frequently been on TV's \\"Law & Order\\" does an excellent cameo as Judge Wylie who signs the writ granting Suratt a reprieve.  Norman Reedus cops some great attitude as conspirator Lewis Payne.  Cullen Moss turns in a strong but brief performance as the aid to Stanton.  There are no weak links in the large cast.  Redford deftly handles an amazingly strong ensemble.  The film builds to its final conclusion as the conspirators climb onto the gallows.<br /><br />The two-disc special edition is well worth the price.  The documentary about the Lincoln assassination is almost an hour long and is extremely well done.  This is a great film and an excellent DVD release.  Enjoy!
B0052WSX32|4.0|I would rate higher, but the promotion for this CD is clearly misleading.  The real story is that the \\"new\\" tracks were recorded in 1985 and 1986 for her TV series \\"Best Friends\\". In all Doris recorded about 16 tracks, 6 of which are represented here. \\"Hurry, It's Lovely Up Here\\" is from her 1971 TV special.    Not exactly the coming-out-of-retirement CD that I had expected based on the press.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Well done graphics, good for distracting brain. Doesn't require speed which is nice. A bit simple compares to Angry Birds.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|I haven't been disappointed in a Bluray release since the HD-DVD/BR battles.  This is the set that broke that streak.<br />If you have the DVD's keep them and don't bother.  We never bought waiting for the BR's and so we'll keep these.  Epic Fail Lucas.
9063692560|4.0|If you're like me, you have a mini-library of those user experience books that are most meaningful to you. I've recently finished reading what is now the latest addition to my own professional mini-library: This Is Service Design Thinking, by Marc Stickdorn, Jakob Schneider, and numerous collaborators and co-authors. This book is likely to become the quintessential service design textbook for students, educators, and professionals alike.     The book covers a non-definition definition of service design, explaining that it's really the successful amalgamation of various fields (including but not limited to interaction, product and graphic design and operations management). It is quite refreshing to see the lack of a solid statement for what service design is as we designers tend to belabor definitions of our disciplines and sub-disciplines to a fault.    The authors then proceed to explain a framework for what service design is through 5 principles. As an advocate for simplicity, I'd  further coalesce the five principles that the book presents. Service design places importance on    1) people--both customers and service providers  2) participatory, ethnographic processes and approaches  3) tangible, visualized design artifacts    The remainder of This Is Service Design Thinking covers the following topics in discreet sections:    - Who are service designers?  - What is the process that service designers follow?  - What are examples of tangible deliverables, tools, and case studies that result from the service design process?      The content, visuals, layout, flow and overall book design are incredibly effective and actionable and I'd recommend it to anyone in the field of design who is interested in exploring how the service economy will intersect with the work you do.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Well, I pre-ordered this long ago and waited, waited, waited.  Arrived without a disk for Episode 5, with bonus disk 1 in it's slot.  There were 2 bonus disk #1s and no episode 5.      The changes made are very hokey.  Dissappointed.
0307887960|3.0|I began Aug 28. The attack phase of all lean protein was gruelling, but the weight came off and that encouraged me to keep going. The next phase, cruise, of alternating protein days with protein and veggies is a challenge given my current life situation. I am a stay at home mom of two toddlers who eat constantly from all the food groups forbidden in the first two phases of this diet (all breads, grains, starches, all fruit, all sugar items, all higher fat dairy, etc.). I found myself getting very depressed and super-angry while on the diet. My husband was not available to help with meals so each time I prepared breakfast for them,  and then for me, then lunch for them, and then for me, then  dinner for them and then for me. Like six separate meals, which was very time consuming. I eventually would eat standing in the corner of my kitchen, chewing a piece of chicken or carrots, while the family ate their meals at the table, so that I could avoid the constant temptation to cheat. It felt so isolating and just seemed wrong for my stage of life.   It is a really difficult regimen to maintain, and quite expensive. Protein is not cheap, so that is another area that families on a budget will have to sacrifice. That was difficult for me because the extra food we were buying was only for me (or mostly). My husband couldn't believe how much meat/protein I would go through, but when you can't have anything but that and non-starch veggies, you get hungry.  I did lose the weight from the last pregnancy, but I stopped there instead of going for my target. I feel I could have had more success if I had more support and was less tied to the kitchen.  Another thing: Dukan's book does not mention the effect of yeast withdrawal, which for many people addicted to sweets like myself, can be worse than any drug detox. I just have not felt like \\"me\\" during the whole process, and don't feel it is fair to inflict \\"angry mom/angry wife\\" on the family just to lose weight.   This plan has somegood points. I think I will keep eating the oat bran, and the lean protein thursdays that he recommends. I also am upping my exercise quotient significantly. Next fall, if I still am carrying an extra 10 pounds or so,  I might try it again. The kids will be older (one in preschool) and I can prepare a little bit better.  As it stands, I would not recommend this particular diet for someone in my life circumstance.
B004GGQMTW|5.0|The classic movie, now in much better picture and sound quality. Picked the used item because it was much cheaper and likely just as good as new, which it was.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Funny, honest and witty portrayal of what it is like to be a sketch comedy writer and a woman making her way in show business. Fey also muses about being a boss, a working mom, nachos and variety of other topics.
B0030BOCKK|5.0|I've been listening to HIM since I was 8 years old and 10 years later I've yet to be disappointed. While not as dark and sinister as some earlier releases, for me, HIM has always been about finding the light and joy in the trials of life. While Screamworks isn't in your face liquid melancholy, it certainly stays true to the core of what HIM really stands for. Just like the heartagram, our own ying-yang symbol, HIM is a flip of dualities. Life & Death. Joy & Sorrow. So many of the older albums are Dark with Light shining through them and that's what we're used to. This time around it's more Light with shadows of darkness leaking through. As Ville says, this is not a happy album. It's just a different way of flipping these dualities that we're so familiar with. At this point, I feel that the band is growing, and I believe we should support them whichever way they go.    I very much look forward to their new album they're working on this fall.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|The ultimate dance film. Forget Misha's chump appearance in The Turning Point; he and the rest of the cast turn in superb performances here. Fantastic dance sequences - especially the one with Misha and tap star Hines sparking off each other and fusing styles. And it's worth buying for the opening ballet alone (Petit's Le Jeune Homme et La Mort).
B003ZSJ212|4.0|In reading all the hate for George Lucas and the new BLU RAY set with all the changes, I was convinced to NOT buy the set. Truthfully, I have the Laserdisc set of the Special Editions and the quality is still good for me, it's even better than the 2004 DVD release. But the other day, I broke down and said, \\"What the heck\\" and bought it. I've watched Episode 3-5 so far. SITH looks , sounds good. \\"New Hope\\" is real good at spots although the black level is a little high on spots, overall a good presentation. \\"Empire\\" is good, a little soft at times but overall a good presentation. If I had seen it before buying would I have still bought? Probably not, however, I don't regret it. The quality is certainly better than the 2004 DVD's and overall, I'm pretty satisfied, yes the packaging could be better and it seems that FOX is not too good at placing the discs, as with the \\"Planet of the Apes\\" boxed set. With all the griping about all the changes, so far I haven't seen any, as for the \\"Nooooo\\" in Jedi, well, I'll watch that tonight but I can live with that, as well as Obi Wan's new scream in \\"New Hope\\". Hey, at least they removed Luke's wimpy yell while falling after his fight with Dad, Darth Vader in \\"Empire\\". Could the transfers have been better, absolutely, but overall, they all seem to be pretty good and not worth all the hub-bub people have been making. If you're a Star Wars fan and want a new print, then buy it if not, rent them or don't. I'm still keeping my Laser Discs and I have the VHS widescreen of the original versions and a laserdisc of Jedi in it's original form. If Lucas releases the original versions which, \\"For God sakes George, listen to the fans, remaster the originals and sell them in a seperate box set\\", I would buy it as well. But if they re-market and re, re-market then I'm just going to stick with these, I will not keep buying. That's ridiculous
B0042KZJ5K|5.0|Wonderful. As a lover of both the Film and  the first soundtrack CD The 2CD Deluxe Edition was a great addition to my collection. I am a bluegrass lover and find this CD certainly satisfies that love. I enjoyed the complete versions of the songs and the ones not in the film or on the original CD. I highly reccomend this CD.

1452101248|5.0|While in London I visited one of Yotam Ottolenghi's shops and took a sampler of salads over to Hyde Park. OK so it was a sunny day and the park was lovely, but the salads made the whole experience amazing. Every bite was YUM. If you enjoy cooking or want to learn how to get more vegetables and fruit into your diet, YOU NEED TO GET AND USE THIS COOKBOOK! Some of the recipes call for ingredients that may be hard to find at your local grocery, but you can usually find them in specialty shops or substitute other ingredients. As with many cookbooks nowadays, the recipes are in paragraph format, which I find difficult to follow when you're cooking, so you might want to read them first and then make a list of steps.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Excellent game, totally worth the money.  I got it as Amazon's free app of the day but I like it so much that I'll probably purchase it on the Android Market just to throw the dev some more support.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had never really tried a workout video before. But, I'd been fighting my \\"baby fat\\", from having my son, for months. I found this video and said, \\"What the heck; I'll try it.\\" I did the video every day and before the 30 days was even over with I had noticed muscles starting to show up in my legs and arms. I'm very pleased with this video. It takes only twenty minutes, so it doesn't consume your day. And it's a good quality workout - I mean come on, it's Jillian Micheals we're talking about! I recommend it.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I was totally fascinated with this book and couldn't put it down. It was honestly one of the best books I have read in a long while. This was the first book I had read by Jodi Picoult and I truly love her writing style.     The book itself brings up situations and issues that you may not normally think about. The details of the book rope you in and make you committed to the characters. It made me laugh and made me cry. It made me love and hate the same characters at different parts of the book. Mostly it brought about understanding of what people go through and why they are/do the things they do at times (ex. the mother of the book is in the most difficult situation possible. At times I didn't like her at all, but then loved her and understood).    I can't say I love the ending at all. It was definitely a twist that I wasn't expecting. I do wish that the ending was different, but it is what it is. Overall, still an excellent read that I will not forget anytime soon.    A BIG TIP: If you love the book, DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE. The movie was terrible and completely 100% different than the book. It was missing so many details and characters and ended completely different. Pretty terrible, especially if you love the book.
B004XIQIPQ|5.0|This product was exactly as advertised. i recommend wholly. A++++. It is all good for me. (more words to appease Amazon.com, though nothing more to say).
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Greedy spiders is challenging, fun, and addictive. The levels start out easy to allow you to get the hang of it, getting tougher as you progress.<br /><br />Like Angry Birds, you get unlimited tries to complete a level and you can always go back to replay a level for a better score.<br /><br />It's simple and uncomplicated, yet really makes you think.
4770031246|5.0|Excellent detail and instructions. The time lines are a great help.  My boys are loving getting the bentos for school.
0071762345|5.0|I loved this book. I haven't read any other books on social media, but this one made SO much sense.  I've read a lot of other business books that are more strategic and harder to implement the concepts.  This one is awesome because I could immediately do what he said to do.  And, I have started seeing results!  We are a small business, but I can now see how the larger businesses that I follow on fb are using these same concepts.  A must read for small businesses looking to understand social media.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|This CD is awesome!! It really shows their talent in using cellos for popular rock tunes. I hope they do other CDs in this genre, my teenager loves it too!! Highly recommend!!
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|What is there to be said about this film that has not already been said, this is as close to hell as we will ever get and i sure as hell can say without a doubt i enjoyed the ride all the way down, this was an adabtation of the marquis de sade's 120 days of sodom which is one of my favorite novels, so this is the closet i can get to my deprived heaven/hell, the film is beatuiful in the grossest sort of way, i can watch this over and over again without flinching because it shows how truly depraved most societys are and the dicktator that rules it, one thing that will never get out of my mind is the  president, he is the most evil villen i have ever seen and will not soon be forgotton, although i would have enjoyed them doing a better story telling plus sould have added a hell of alot more to the book in it, not to mention the kids in the book were 12 to 15 not 16 to 18, but it still remains my numberone movie plus it will scare people off faster thanks for the time s.d.l.
B003L77GRO|4.0|Once again, Dexter delivers. This is a haunting season which we really enjoyed. We're looking forward to seeing the Sixth Season...!
B002WJI66C|3.0|I got this for my 6 yr. old son that loves anything Mario.  I thought it looked great and people said they loved that you could push out the tongue, but it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be.  I suppose it's my own fault...I should have gotten out a tape measure and figured out how big it would be, but I was still disappointed nevertheless.  I just fits in his hand...isn't much to really hug or sleep with or do a whole lot with.  It's still a fine toy though, but I probably would have gotten a different character if I would have realized the size.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Not very often do I say this but,...I wish I had seen this film in the theaters on the big screen. DVD is awesome but my 32\\" TV just can't do the movie's grandeur justice.     Oh and before you ask, YES I am a huge fan of the comic books, and read Thor quite often. I think, what this film did best, was to take Thor off the pages of the comics, and place him on the big screen with (and this is important) true realism.   Okay, stop scratching your heads. What I mean is, I know its a fantasy but the filmmakers spared no expense to make it all seem ...real. Yes, there are changes from the book to the movie, but these are natural.   Most notably is the inclusion of a multi-ethnic cast. Changing the ethnicity of some of the characters was genius. It made it seem more true to life.     The costumes are another big chance from book to movie. Hollywood has gotten the message, yellow spandex doesn't work on film. No yellow spandex here. All the costumes are more armor-like, and give a nod to their comic book origins. The sets are spectacularly detailed. Even something as far-fetched as the \\"rainbow bridge\\" was made perfectly and felt true to the books while maintaining a sense of reality. This movie is action packed, some laughs at just the right moments, good solid story, and great cast. The directing is clean and very clear. Even if you have never read a page of the comic book, you will not get lost or feel left out.    If I had to give one complaint to this otherwise perfect movie, it would be in the DVD itself. There is no long, behind the scenes, \\"making of\\" Thor bonus on here. There is a very short Avengers tease, but that's it. This DVD needs a full 2 hour making of segment. Other than that, I would still have to say, don't rent, buy it.   And don't forget to wear your authentic Thor replica helmet and hold your realistic plastic hammer Mjolnir while you watch. You're gonna need them.
B005HED5YW|5.0|Love the ability to see these agin, in enhanced HD. It was shot on film, so why not. More old classics, MTM Studios, shot on 35mm too! Just one thing, someone tell Amazon Star Trek was on NBC!
B0058VA2U4|4.0|I am also a John Bush fan and I have always liked Joey as well. This is a great album. I still think that WCFYA is better. Joey is a better singer that is for sure.  I am not dissappointed at all in Worship Music.  It really just does not grab me like WCFYA did.  Would I still recomend it.  Hell Yeah!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|As much as I hate getting outsmarted by machines, this game makes it fun. Doesn't go to fullscreen on a Viewsonic gTablet running Flashback 8.1 tho.
0470474874|5.0|great textbook for a computer systems class. lots of useful tips and tricks. author gives lots of details and uses illustrations to show how to do many complex and advanced things.
B002JEB0ZO|5.0|Highly entertaining; hilarious; great plot twists.  We are \\"Prime\\" members and got to watch it for free.  What a bargain!  But even if you are on a pay-to-play basis, it would be money well spent. You won't be disappointed.

B004WKOCQC|5.0|I really liked this album. One of my favorites in the last couple of years. I would highly recommend it.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I am a sci-fi geek at heart and X-Men is one movie series I love.  Normally I am not a big fan when they start making pre-quels to movie but \\"X-Men:  First Class\\" was pretty good.  It is a movie showing the main mutants from the beginning, starting with Charles Xavier (Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto).  I always knew they had a friendly relationship before they became enemies and this movie shows that, along with how some of the other popular mutants came to be.  You get to see Mystic, the Beast and a few others as teenagers just learning to control their mutant abilities.  You also get to learn how Professor X ended up in a wheelchair, and how each of Professor X and Magneto's childhoods were.  It goes to show how one's childhood can shape their adulthoods.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this movie.  It is actually probably my favorite X-Men thus far.  I wish we could have seen more mutants but who knows if they will make a sequel to this movie!  There is a lot that could have been added to the movie that wasn't but I still feel like I learned a lot about the characters and it developed the series well.
0131103628|5.0|Still the best way to learn C. I already knew C when I read it, and I learned a lot.
B000001ELR|4.0|At long last, a rock solid KISS album!  It had been a while... 'The Elder' and 'Unmasked' just didn't do it for me.  Obviously, you probably know the story.  Vinnie Vincent plays lead guitar on this album even though Ace is pictured on the album cover.  Vinnie adding some vigor to the band, Eric's powerful drumming, and Gene and Paul both bringing strong songs to the table.  One of the best albums in their catalog... it's tough to put it up there with their first 6 studio albums, but it's close!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Great gameplay and well-made app, actually challenging, makes you think. I like the sound effects and feel of the game. Good job!
0880793082|5.0|This deck has three versions of the Magus atu. It was printed in Belgium. Its quality combined with great price make this product very attractive.
0553801473|4.0|I thought I would never finish reading this book, and I would not have either if it wasn't for the fact that I needed to return it. Book five is a great read, but the series continues to just be wordy (go on and on and on). This book did not have Sansa in it at all, only three chapters with Cersei, and Arya in it. The characters came into the novel towards the end of the book. Bran has about five chapters before his character all together disappears from the novel about a third into the book ( I guess we will read more about him in the next wordy novel.  Many of the chapters consisted of several new characters that in my opinion could have been left out.  In book five, Jon, Tyrion, and Dany make up most of the chapters. In the end another of my favorite characters dies (the Starks don't favor well in this series).
6304698623|5.0|what can i say i really enjoyed this movie...though i dont like the change ups from the book....i did really enjoy it and im in my 30's...my daughter and i watched it as our mommy daughter movie night and we both loved it...it is somewhat different then the book..which did bother me but well worth the watch!!!
B004V98UKS|4.0|This is a fun little puzzle game. Worth the 99&cent; price it commands. It's a very nicely polished game glad I waited for today.
B005974CDU|5.0|I got into Dream Theater 10 years ago on the word of a coworker at the time.  My first purchase was \\"Images and Words\\" and from there, I was off.  Picked up everything they made (except \\"When Dream and Day Unite\\"), and waited w/ baited breath for new releases.  I will admit, the last couple, while decent didn't really grab me.  I am aware of the backstory that led to Mike Portnoy's departure and Mike Mangini's hiring and watched the documentary on You Tube.  It did give me a good feeling regarding the direction DT would take and made me want to continue to see what they were up to.  I kept hearing how great this album is and waited in anticipation of it.  When I got it, I listened and just listened again.  I love the way the music breathes on this record, and for the first time in years, you can hear every member's contribution.  In many ways, this album speaks to me on a personal level, especially on the last 3 tracks.  This album is just so solid from beginning to end that I KNOW I will absorb every aspect of it.  Something I had not done with a Dream Theater album in a long time. I won't go into a blow by blow of the songs on this album, but I will say that \\"Breaking All Illusions\\" might be one of the most inspired pieces of music I have ever heard.  It is the epitome of a band reinvigorated.  Everything else here is nearly as incredible and it has a lot of heart.  It feels as natural as anything I've heard them do in a long time.  I can feel the emotions of these songs, the moods and it feels as though if there was ever an album I was just waiting for, it's this one.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I gave this item 4 stars because it isn't perfect.  In a perfect world, GL would have released the original restored theatrical versions of his movies on blu ray.  But he didn't so let's move on.<br /><br />The way I look at it, you don't go to a concert to hear the EXACT same thing that was put on record do you?  You want to see or hear something a little different.  I think that's what we have here.  It's still Star Wars.<br /><br />We all know Greedo shot first and Darth Vader doesn't scream \\"Noooooo\\" while disposing the Emperor.  Most of us probably have every single verson of all the movies so if it's that important, just throw in one of those discs in the player.<br /><br />Now on to the positives.  First, I love the packaging.  Very original to make it look like a book with some beautiful artwork.  Rather than keeping the discs in individual plastic boxes or one giant box where the discs can get loose in transit.<br /><br />The picture and sound quality are fantastic.  No issues with my Sony player reading and playing the discs.<br /><br />The bonuses are fantastic as well.  So much more entertainment than just the movies.  9 discs for $80?  That's $8.88 per disc so you get a lot for the value.  True, there have been documentaries (i.e. the excellent \\"Empire of Dreams\\") that were left off.  Again,  you probably already own it somewhere else.<br /><br />So I gave it four stars.  Taking one star away due to the minor changes made; leaving 4 for all the other good things about the set.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|After spending hours of searching the net for the iPhone 4 case, zeroed onto this due to it's high ratings. With 9 bucks getting both screen protector and the protective case was quite a tempting option. I agree with everyone who gave this 5 or 4 star ratings! This case is truly unbeatable for its price and quality. I do admit that I am bit novice to this case business (I mean, I haven't tried plenty of them), but I can say that this one is truly great.  PROS-  1. Snug fitting, without any hassles, and once fit, not easy to move.  2. You WILL feel your iPhone to be protected. I can lift it up more comfortably than it was without it.  3. No interference with any buttons on iphone! The nice wide window on the volume button side has made sure that this case will fit both AT & T and verizon iPhones.  4. The TPU (Thermoplastic polyurethane) material is rubbery, which not only cushions the phone but also gives a non-slippery grip. However, this does not interfere with you sliding the phone in-out of the pocket.  5. The screen protector is a super bonus. It's crystal clear and the iphone display indeed looks CLEAN WITH BRILLIANT COLORS! No kidding. It holds onto all the promises it makes in the product description.  I would have preferred a clean transparent background but I think the concentric rings are better, because over a period of time, the clarity of any transparent material wanes (like the plastic boxes you have for storage), hence, these rings might be better of that times. Also, I think they make the case bit sturdy.  CONS-  Only one- the screen protector is a oil and fingerprint magnet. You use your phone just to make one call (with your \\"just washed\\" hands), and you can see the finger trails on it. I wipe it clean at least 10-15 times a day with the cloth provided in order to keep my iphone looking \\"just out of the box\\". I don't know whether this is a common problem to all screen protectors, but in this case, it is. However, as this protector is a bonus, you can buy a seperate one if necessary. Most important- the case does not disturb the screen protector. No bubbles, no peeling.    Summary-  Great value for your money as you get both the screen protector and the protective case in 9 bucks. A strong and perfect contendor for apple's bumpers and case protectors charging insanely 30-45 bucks. Looks sturdy, clean and fits well in your iPhone. Stop your search and buy this. You won't regret.
B004RKXW0E|5.0|Wonderful movie that is loved by the 2 year old and the 42 year old alike! Having both a DVD copy and a Blue-Ray copy makes it really useful to be used both at home and at the grandparents' home.

B0040UAYI4|5.0|Coming from a PC and going to a hand controller sucks. This eagle eye converter is awesum!!! I used a logitech mouse and a normal dell keyboard and it worked great. some mice and keyboards cant be used but as long as you dont try and use an advanced KB & Mouse, it will work. i use a 5 button mouse(two side buttons and a middle button) and it works great. once i set up my button layout, i played black ops. i instantly felt more comfortable playing and my k/d ratio went up and kill streak went up. this was all within one night of using the eagle eye. if you are a pc gamer and want to play on the ps3, get this converter. u wont regret it.

B0051GOB26|5.0|The Blu-ray of \\"The Big Lebowski\\" is a thing of beauty for all 'Dude' fans everywhere. The visuals onscreen are amazing, and the bonus features are packed with enough good stuff to keep you bowling for more. I was very excited to get this in the mail and consider it a great purchase.
B002NFCHBA|5.0|he was the first greatest pianist ever, to be followed by my other half, the pianist and composer, Edward Covarrubias, who has yet to be recorded.the cd set is worth the bucks, however, i donated it to goodwill so more people can learn what good music is.<br />and on Edward. he says in less than 6 minutes what it took Chopin 6 pages to say.and all with no words too.
0312330537|2.0|The first part of the book captured my attention. Even though some of it was a bit rough, there was humor and a sense of really seeing a part of India that Westerners don't often encounter. After a while the story darkened but I was still interested. But when I got to a very intense section (I won't give away the plot...) that went on and on and on, I skimmed that section and then I questioned why I would want to spend my time immersed in all that misery. So I quit.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I enjoy reading an historical fiction book now and then, and the medieval period is interesting.<br /><br />I picked up this book solely due to the HBO show.  I read a lot but to be honest I had never heard of GRRM and his works before.  I generally enjoyed the well-cast show, but there are so many minor characters involved that at times it would exceed my allotted memory capacity and I would get a bit lost.  So I kindled the book and read it on two long airplane trips.<br /><br />Now I understand the show a lot better, though even in the book the vast number of characters becomes a bit tedious.  And all in all it's not a bad read as historical fiction; however it completely crossed over into the realm of science fiction in the last few pages of the book.  I'm not saying that I am definitely not reading the rest of the series, but it's unlikely.  However, I can understand how this book is very attractive to its fans.<br /><br />Try it - you might really enjoy it.  Or not.
1451629184|4.0|Horrific; that is the one word that sums up this book. The things I look for in a memoir are good writing and brutal honesty. Jaycee manages both as she tells about her life as a prisoner of a mentally deranged sex offender. At its heart it is the story of a little girl's courage as she endures unending torture and still come out the other end capable of loving relationships.    What hit home the most for me is my own daughter is 11 years old right now and she constantly wants to hug me, like all the time. One of Jaycee's last memories prior to being kidnapped was she had scolded her mother the night before for forgetting to kiss her goodbye in the morning. That morning her mom forgot once again. It is clear this action affected her deeply and I can only imagine what this has done to her mom over the years since. It makes me more mindful to hug my daughter when she wants to, because the extremely rare stranger abduction aside, there will come a day when she is a teenager when she won't want to anymore.    I like how she tells the events in a straight forward manner and then reflects back on her feelings about those same events. I do not know the time frame between the two, but you can tell she has spent the time processing her thoughts and feelings. As she states in the introduction, the book would be different yet again if she were to write it ten years from now.  I also would agree when reflecting on the abuse that she does not understand why anyone would do those things to another human being, let alone a little girl. It is such a simple statement but yet so powerful. It washes away all of her abusers justifications for his abhorrent actions.    The only unfortunate tone found in the book is she spends a lot of time indirectly making it clear how much control and influence her abuser had over her life. It is sad that she finds it necessary to express this as obviously she has been questions by unthinking people as to whether she had a part in her abuse over the 19 years. Stuff like Why didn't you just run away? Those opinions are idiotic and people forget that she was just a little girl and has no part and no blame in anything that happened. The fact she is as resilient as she now seems is a testament to her personal strength.    This is a powerful book that will make you hug your children a little closer, and show you just how strong the spirit of one young girl can be in the face of complete evil. It shows that scenarios depicted in books like Room can unfortunately be real, and we need to speak up when we see the abuse of children in our lives.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|I've read the book and now I've watched the movie.  As you can tell from the other reviews, the movie is \\"based\\" on the book and thats about it.  I would love to find out why the changes were necessary, it wasn't as if the book was very long and needed to be trimmed. And the book didn't really have any twists and turns that couldn't have been translated into a move- who knows.  Truthfully- in my opinion, I don't think there was really a need to make the book into a movie. I enjoyed the books well enough, but I felt that certain parts of the book were silly.      The movie standing on its own...I'd give it 5 stars for special effects and cinematography - Olympus and Hades were visually gorgeous!  But I would give it only about 2 stars for acting and storyline.  If you're going to expose an audience to Greek mythology- get it right!  Hades wasn't Hell - it was the underworld. Death - the good and the bad.  That part in the movie annoyed me.  Also- Ares played such a big part in the book, that in the movie, it seemed that they were going out of their way to not mention him. In a movie about a great war, why wasn't the god of war in the movie. So silly.     The only piece of story line I felt made sense, was looking for the pearls.  In the book, all of the \\"monsters\\" they ran into throughout their quest felt silly to me.      Otherwise the movie story was so weak. The actual villain in the movie was ridiculous. Seriously - why couldn't they have used the real villain??? Kronos is much more interesting and terrifying than a boy.  Disappointed.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|It is so refreshing to read a heroine done right.  You get a superwoman (witch) character but you are brought along with Diana; you are inside her head and along the way the archetype is cast aside.  If you love historical details, then you will love this book.  If you love character development, you will love this book.  And if you get a kick out of vampires, witches and such, then you will enjoy this tale as I did.  Can't wait for part two.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|This is a stylish coming of age/action movie about a 16 year-old genetically perfected for combat girl who is raised in isolation by an ex-CIA agent for the sole purpose of revenging her mother's death.  It's hard not to feel for Hanna having been deprived of a normal childhood.  The acting is very good although the plot is weak in places.  All in all I enjoyed this movie a lot.  P.S.  Can't get the creepy German guy music out of my head.

B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I'm so sick of all you \\"fans\\" who whine & complain about every single comic-movie-adaptation... because it's always the same things... it wasn't this / that... they weren't this / that... it should / shouldn't be this / that...  It's an ADAPTATION... what part of that word is soooo confusing!?    If it were a billed & promoted as a \\"faithful adaptation\\"... THEN & ONLY THEN, should you get soooo upset about the stupid & petty things that you people get upset about!    ______    I've never read a comic in my life... when I see these movies, I base my judgement on whether the movie is GOOD, OR NOT... because That Is All That Truly Matters!    Be THANKFUL there's a Movie of your favorite Comic-Hero(s)... and enjoy it for what it is... A MOVIE ADAPTATION.  (or if it stinks, then hate it because it stinks -- not because it didn't have this, that, or whatever)    _____  Thor was a GREAT film... Fun for ALL ages... and one of the truly 5-Star Comic Adaptations I've seen in a while.  (and not because of the 3D -- and not solely for the amazing visuals --- the acting was GREAT --- and portrays ALL the characters, exactly how they were MEANT TO BE Portrayed... NOT how a handful of comic-fans, Thought they should be portrayed, based on a \\"series/run\\" you liked more than another \\"series/run\\")  ___  Also, if you go in thinking \\"most marvel films are going to stink; but Thor should be the best marvel film ever because of Asgard\\", as a few, \\"fans\\", have stated... then you put waaaaay to much expectation into this film --- and NOTHING would have lived up to it, even if EVERYTHING was exactly as you thought it should be!  (because let's face it -- people like you are NEVER satisfied!)    _____    Of all the comic adaptations I've seen... when I saw trailers for Thor, I thought, Oh wow... that's either going to be really good... or REALLY BAD (kinda like Green Lantern) -- I didn't even see Thor in the Theaters because I don't like wasting my money on movies that I'm not at least 80% sure on.... but man, I wish I had... seeing Thor 3D on the Big-Screen, would've had my mouth, gaping open w/ amazement, the entire time. (just from the visuals... never mind the rest of the 5-Star movie)  _____    In the end, if you're still on the fence about this movie, due to all the comic-dorks who are never satisfied anyway.... then borrow it from a friend, or rent it / stream it / whatever... my guess is, you'll be pleasantly surprised, if you go in with an open mind.      PS: Comic-dorks... don't bother commenting... I don't read or reply... so save your insults for another comic-adapted-movie, which I'm sure you can't wait to write about.

B0050AV5MW|1.0|4 to 5 star series in terms of the actual writing, but the digital version costs $7.18 than the printed version. That's about 35% more expensive. How does that make sense?     There's no manufacturing costs. I can't lend my copy to a friend or resell it. I could've even borrowed the books from my local library for free.

B004ULNJF8|4.0|A throwback to the hardcore 70's crime drama. Street level thugs and street level cops - neither of whom are playing by the rules. This fantastic retro vibe is recreated in 'Blitz'. It's a difficult style to film and I've seen it done with this level of excellence in just a handful of movies, the Mel Gibson film '[[ASIN:B000M3439O Payback]]' being one.<br /><br />Muted colors and harshly lit scenes are a true flashback to movies like '[[ASIN:B0015XHQTY The Enforcer]]' - a grisly look down into the ugliness of dark alleyways and dingy backrooms. No beautiful runway model crime scene investigators, no rock-n-roll themed music, no happy family waiting at home.<br /><br />Whiskey, harsh flourescents and a couch are all that await you - the job is everything because you have nothing else.<br /><br />Boiled down, 'Blitz' is an ol' fashioned good cop/bad cop dynamic. Jason Statham's brutal street cop, Detective Brant pushed to work with Luke Evans' gay by-the-book office cop, Detective Inspector Stokes. Extreme polar opposites who recognize that they need the other's divergent skillset, forcing them to put aside their differences in order to catch a psychotic thrill killer.<br /><br />Part of the fun is watching them warily test one another, the slow recognition that each is a good cop in his own way. Finally, that bonding of partners that will cement them as buddies over the course of events.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to praise Aiden Gillen. He seems to be one of those actors that can only portray nutters - it's something in his eyes, that weird glint, that touch of madness. I have doubts that he can play 'normal'. But I give him props for doing crazy well; it can be a career maker for some. I'm still hopeful he'll be able to break out of the pigeon-hole, e.g. Dennis Hopper or Malcolm McDowell, and eventually get to work on straight roles, because I really enjoy his performances.<br /><br />My only complaint is the police officer character played by Zawe Ashton. On one hand I sort of got it. But on the other, her character seemed like it was written for a more integral purpose in the original draft of the script, but later revisions/edits moved beyond and she was left behind. Or worse, because her plot line was in the source novel, the filmmakers decided they 'had' to include it for the movie. Unfortunately, her excellent and sincere portrayal felt misplaced and oddly unfinished in the film. I think 'Blitz' would've been a tighter project without the extraneous drama and pointless drug fueled sub-plot.<br /><br />Flat out fun if you're into these kinds of retro cop rumbles. And to be blunt, I want more of this from Statham = Kick ass, no apologies.<br /><br />Jason's the top action hero in the movies today and I hope to see more like this from the man. Especially from UK productions where there seems to be a harder edge to his work, it's an energy his more processed US productions don't always capture.her character seemed like it was written for a more integral purpose in the original draft of the script, but later revisions/edits moved beyond and she was left behind.

6304119046|1.0|Orson Welles wanted to make himself obnoxious and he succeeded. Very pretentious movie, not very intelligent, even more annoying than Last Year in Marienbad or the English Patient. The Emperor's New Clothes. For the undiscriminating viewer who badly wants to be high class.
B005974C94|3.0|The tile says 'play the blues'; it's a lie to boost sales. This is dixielnd Jazz. What's Taj Mahal doing singing on three tracks? This isn't much of an Eric Clapton album; very little guitar is discernable, but when Clapton sings all else fades away. He just gets greater every time out. Even though he only sings a handful of tracks, I'd buy this 'farse of the blues' just for those.

B003YBUSMW|2.0|In short, I am on my 3rd Madcatz wireless racing wheel for the xbox 360 in less than a year. The first wheel, the left paddle shifter stopped working. After I had to pay for the postage to send it to Madcatz, they sent me a new wheel. They were careless shipping the replacement wheel to me, when I receieved it, the side panel where the sync button and mic jack was pushed in. After contacting customer service they mailed me another new wheel for no charge, allowing me to keep the wheel with the side panel pushed in. The 3rd wheel worked for well for a few months, but now the D-pad is not working when pushing down on it. Again I have to pay for the postage to have this wheel looked at.     In game the wheel it great it provides very smooth concise control, it does make the gaming experience enjoyable.     I will give the next wheel a chance, if it malfunctions I will abandon Madcatz and pay out the big bucks for a better quality wheel.

B004XGN8W4|4.0|Earlier this year I joined the Navy, I ship for boot camp in January. Being an avid gamer I will of course be bringing my playstation along whenever and wherever I get the chance after I graduate boot camp. But even a 22\\" PC monitor is a pain to travel with, let alone a full size TV, not to mention getting either of those onto a ship. When I came across the G155 I knew that I had found the solution. And while I'm not sure if it will be able to accompany me shipboard at the very least it will make life a little easier the rest of the time.    The first thing I did after taking the unit out of the box was load my playstation 3, two controllers, and all of the necessary cords into the G155. After closing the unit everything feels secure and well protected, I feel confident that the G155 will safely transport my playstation and accessories. The weight is reasonable and the carry handle makes it a simple matter to transport. I also discovered that it is possible to carry two games in the G155 by placing them under the straps holding the playstation. The only items I won't be able to carry in the unit itself are my headset, which is expected since it is huge, and any additional games. For travel I give the G155 a 5/5, it does everything I could reasonably hope for in this category.    Unfortunately not everything was well with my unit. After opening it back up and connecting all of the necessary power and video cords I turned it on only to discover that my screen was badly damaged. A phone call to GAEMS and a few emails later and I had a new, fully functional unit on my doorstep the next day! A big thank you to Travis, John and everyone else at GAEMS for the excellent and lighting fast support. GAEMS as a company gets a 5/5 in my book, they stand by their products 100%.    After receiving the replacement unit I finally got a chance to do some gaming on the G155. And while the viewing angles aren't exceptional nor the colors highly accurate, overall it is a pleasure to game on the G155's screen. The 15\\" size is perfect as long as you aren't expecting to sit more than a couple of feet away from it and despite being advertised as 720p my unit accepts 1080p input just fine. Sound is surprisingly good, no one is going to mistake it for home theater surround sound, but it is definitely a step up from the laptop quality speakers you might expect in a unit this size. They are about equal to what you might find built into your flatscreen TV. I give the screen and speakers a 4/5, not perfect, but nothing to complain about unless you are really picky.    Overall I give the G155 a 4/5 and look forward to gaming wherever the Navy takes me, be it on land or sea.    ---    PS: You may have to reset the video output on the playstation 3 the first time you connect it to the G155. To do this, instead of simply pressing the power button to turn the playstation on, hold the button down until the playstation beeps and video is displayed.

B001FZ0A7W|5.0|\\"Into the Labyrinth\\" is one of my favorite Dead Can Dance albums. It could make a fine introduction to their music. It's haunting and melancholy. Perhaps a bit strong for simple background music, but I can imagine using it as part of one's soundtrack for a more downbeat Halloween party, as music to read horror novels to, or to have on while playing a tabletop or live-action horror role-playing game.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Seriously, how long are George Lucas and Fox going to make me wait for an unedited version of the trilogy?    I don't care if there is an option to view the new changes.  Actually I think that would be kind of cool.  I even [gasp] liked *some* of the more subtle changes (e.g. walking dewbacks in the background of ANH). I just also want a way to NOT watch them as I think 95% of the changes are aweful.    How old will I be before I can relive my childhood (but in high def)?
B000PMG16U|5.0|First of all, I own the complete saga blu-ray set. I bought it like this for the films as well as the features not in this prequel or original saga sets.

I know of no one who would want these and not the original trilogy.

B004EPZ09S|5.0|The fears and realities of global viruses have always been in existence since travel was basically invented; but with the explosion of all kinds of technology and modes of transportation, those fears and realities have exploded.  Even as far back as 1918, a virulent strain known as the Spanish flu killed 800,000 people in the United States alone, and as many as eighteen million more across the world.  In our time, such things as bird flu, swine flu, SARS, and H1N1 have put health officials in all corners of the world on edge, especially when it is found out that the strains often develop immunities to the very vaccines we use to treat them.  This is the subject dealt with in CONTAGION, a solid medical science fiction/suspense docudrama that has a degree of realism fueled by a combination of fact and speculation.    Like more than a few disaster epics of the 1970s, CONTAGION puts a large cast of all-stars in an insightful, disturbing, and highly charged situation as an unnamed virus, which begins its deadly spread throughout the world as the result of an innocuous occurrence involving a female executive (Gwyneth Paltrow) in Hong Kong spreads into America, infecting just a few people at first, but pretty soon exploding into a health crisis the likes of which no country has ever seen.  Laurence Fishburne and Kate Winslet are the doctors based out of CDC headquarters in Atlanta who try to develop the appropriate vaccines for this strain, which, like so many flu bugs, has a genetic code to it seemingly meant to ward off any kind of medicine applied to it.  Marion Cottilard is the French doctor sent by the World Health Organization (WHO) to Hong Kong to track the exact origin of the flu.  Jude Law portrays a conspiracy blogger who contends that the CDC and governments all over the world have the antidote in their hands but are not willing to share it so as to cash in on the deaths of what eventually turn out to be tens of millions of people.  Matt Damon portrays Paltrow'sgrieving husband who has to stand watch over his two motherless children who might be infected, even though he himself already has the right amount of antibodies to avoid catching the strain.    While there have been more than a few \\"virus/disease\\" films over the years, CONTAGION seems to be the most realistic of the bunch, and, as a result, probably the most frightening.  The tendency to have the entire cast go into hysterics over people dropping dead like flies all around is wisely avoided by director Steven Soderbergh, whose credits include ERIN BROCKOVICH and TRAFFIC.  Instead, he opts for a docudrama-like approach, with numerous sequences of hand-held camera movements that make the drama seem as realistic as possible without dipping into technique for technique's sake.  The situation is highly realistic, as anyone who has studied the history of previous viral epidemics will easily attest to; not only are such pandemics possible today, they are practically inevitable when taken into account the way technology and travel have evolved, and given the everyday habits of people that can lead to viruses being spread around without anyone knowing about it until it has already happened to them.    Instead of being another scary Hollywood shocker (though it is definitely scary), CONTAGION largely succeeds at putting up a plausible scenario for an infectious disease mutating into a worldwide problem in which a cure can't come fast enough.   Furthermore, it also urges us to think about how the entire world's population has become so interdependent on others in times of crises, such as viral epidemics of the kind depicted in this film.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|That's right I said it they have never looked better. At first I was one who was against blu-ray not just for Star Wars but for all movies. I warmed up to it and this was the set I wanted to get the most. I got it and was able to look through all the movies. What I have seen and hared has blowen me away. Seeing these movies on my HDTV in 1080i (sure ANH, TESB, ROTJ, and TPM were not filmed in 1080i) looks great so much better then any DVD.    As for the changes I'm a Star Wars fan I love the Star Wars Saga and having them look the way they do on my TV well I still have my DVDs but I don't know how often I will go back and watch them on DVD. Thank you George Lucas. And before the haters say anything. Sure there are some flaws. But you know what I enjoy them and that's really all that matter to me is what I think.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I did this faithfully for 30 days AND cut my calories to be between 1200-1500, which is a lot to cut for me being 40-50 lbs overweight. I was rather disappointed that I didn't at least look leaner. My before and after pics looked almost identical except for a slight difference in outer thigh area. My pants are slightly looser, but I did not go down any sizes. I didn't lose any inches, but who knows I could have measured differently and I only lost a few pounds. I did not do any additional exercising. This video promised results in 20 minutes a day (along with the diet) and for me it did not deliver. I gave it 3 stars because I probably have a thyroid problem and I've always had trouble losing weight, but it was an alright workout. Yes I had to modify half the moves, but I was still working as hard as I could and even pushed through ankle, knee, and wrist pain by using ace wraps. I'm sure I looked like a freakin mummy. I am glad I didn't weigh myself till the end or I would have quit halfway through, so the best thing about this is that I conquered it and at least now I know it won't work for me.
B004WKH4PS|5.0|\\"Mildred Pierce\\" is a 1945 black and white film noir about a long suffering mother and her ungrateful child. It was based on the 1941 novel of the same name by James Cain (\\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\", \\"Double Indemnity\\")<br /><br />Joan Crawford (1905-77) plays the loving mother. She was one of the biggest stars of the 30s and 40s, and AFI rates her #10 on the list of the All Time Greatest Female Stars. She'd married Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in 1927, starred in \\"Grand Hotel\\" (1932) and was named \\"Queen of the Movies\\" by Life magazine in 1937, but then made a series of box office flops. However, she won the Academy Award for this film and was nominated again in 1947 (\\"Possessed\\") and 1952 (\\"Sudden Fear\\"). Following Johnny Guitar (1954), her 82nd film, she turned her attention to television and to Pepsi, the firm her new husband was involved in.<br /><br />FWIW - Crawford made a career in the 30s playing a working girl who succeeds, so her role in Mildred Pierce was perfect.<br /><br />Beautiful Ann Blyth (1928) plays the ungrateful daughter. Blyth made more than 20 films before turning her attentions to TV in the late 50s. She was nominated for an Oscar for her role in this film and won a Laurel for \\"The Helen Morgan Story\\" (1957).<br /><br />There is an excellent supporting cast with Jack Carson, Zach Scott, Eve Arden, Bruce Bennett, and Butterfly McQueen.<br /><br />Handsome Zachary Scott (1914-65) often played a scoundrel in films like \\"Flamingo Road\\" (1949) and \\"Shadow on the Wall\\" (1950), often paired with Ann Sothern, Nancy Davis, or Joan Crawford. Scott plays Crawford's husband and this is one of the few \\"homme fatale\\" in film noir.<br /><br />Funnyman Jack Carson (1910-63) plays a man infatuated with Crawford. Carson made 50+ films before transitioning to TV in the early 50s where he had his own show (1954-5). He's best known for his films with Dennis Morgan (\\"Shine on, Harvest Moon\\", \\"Two Guys from Milwaukee\\").<br /><br />Bruce Bennett (1906-2007) plays Crawford's first husband. Bennett was a staple in B films in the 40s and 50s.<br /><br />Funny and sarcastic Eve Arden (1908-90) plays a friend of Crawford. She was nominated for an Oscar for this film but she's best known for her Emmy winning role as \\"Our Miss Brooks\\" (1952-6).<br /><br />Director Michael Curtiz (1886-1962) is best known for his 7 films with Errol Flynn. He was nominated for an Oscar for their first collaboration (\\"Captain Blood\\", 1935), and received 2 more nominations for films with Jimmy Cagney - \\"Angels with Dirty Faces\\"(1938) and \\"Yankee Doddle Dandy\\" (1941) - and one win for a film with Bogart (\\"Casablanca\\", 1942). Curtiz had a sense of humor about himself - he once declared \\"The next time I want an idiot to do this, I'll do it myself.\\"<br /><br />FWIW - The Malibu beach house in the film was actually Curtiz' own home.<br /><br />Ernest Haller (1896-1970) provides beautiful black and white photography and tilts toward film noir even if he doesn't embrace it fully. Haller filmed more than 100 movies and was nominated for an Oscar 7 times, three times for films with Bette Davis (\\"Jezebel\\" in 1938, \\"All This and Heaven Too\\" in 1940, and \\"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\\" in 1962), and won once for \\"GWTW\\" (1939).<br /><br />Max Steiner (1888-1971) did the musical score. Between 1935 and 1956 he was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for \\"Since You Went Away\\" (1944), \\"Now Voyager\\" (1942), and \\"The Informer\\" (1935). He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.<br /><br />1945 was not a banner year for films. The top grossing films were \\"Mom and Dad\\", \\"The Bells of St. Mary's\\", \\"Leave Her to Heaven\\", \\"Spellbound\\", and \\"Anchors Aweigh.\\" The big Oscar and Golden Globe winner was \\"The Lost Weekend\\" (Picture, Director, Actor). Notable films released that year included film noir classic \\"Scarlett Street\\".<br /><br />Variety called the film \\"a class feature\\" and said \\"the dramatics are heavy but so skillfully handled that they never cloy.\\" The NY Times praised Crawford - \\"a sincere and generally effective characterization\\" - and Curtiz - \\"cunning dramatic artifice\\" -  but found the plot unconvincing.<br /><br />The film was nominated for 6 Oscars (Picture, Screenplay, Supporting Actress, Cinematography) but only Crawford won.<br /><br />The film benefits not only from great direction, photography, and acting, it's one of the few twists on the classic film noir where the female is the hapless hero led down a tragic path, and the \\"femme fatale\\" is actually a man (Zach Scott). If the film has any fault it is that it is a bit too long at 111 minutes.<br /><br />Bottom line - this classic film noir with a twist benefits from great acting, direction, and photography making it a must see for film fans.fective characterization\\" - and Curtiz - \\"cunning dramatic artifice\\" -  but found the plot unconvincing.

B005LY4B0A|4.0|pretty fun! need to think on some of the puzzles. can be a challenge. well worth it!!! simple, but neat graphics.
0553801473|3.0|I'll keep this short and sweet.  As with all of the books in this series, I enjoyed reading A Dance With Dragons.  I had to give it three stars because it was stagnant in parts, adding even more new characters was confusing, and the story moved along at a snail's pace (disappointment after waiting years for release).  It was still an entertaining read and hopefully just a bridge into the next book where the story will progress more instead of continuing to meander.<br /><br />Our reviews won't deter anyone from getting the book that is already a fan (that's not my intent anyway).  Hopefully Martin reads them and takes them to heart when working on the next one.
B004J64QR4|4.0|Everything about this concert was top notch EXCEPT for Nick Jonas as Marius. Every time he performed I wanted to smash the screen. He can't sing. OK he can sing in tune but that's about it. I could rag on him for a long time but just YouTube a couple of examples and you'll see. This guy can't hold a note for more than a few seconds without clipping it short. He has no sustain. When you compare him to others who played Marius in the past like Michael Ball, or any of the others, Jonas looks like a high school performer.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|Unfortunately the DVD of WALL-E was defective and had to be returned for refund and not for a replacement.  This was a gift for my granddaughter, so much anticipation was followed by much disappointment.  I highly recommend that the DVDs be tested for sending.  And I am reluctant to reorder from this source.
0800141660|5.0|The generation of Asian directors erupted in the West since the mid-eighties with unusual force. Japan lost its customary leadership and Ang Lee was part of that breed of talented directors of the rising sun.<br /><br />In my view, Lee has done many good movies but if it comes to masterpieces, there are two that are far above the rest: Lust caution and Sense and Sensibility.<br /><br />Armed with this visual refinement that goes back to James Ivory (What Remains the day) and rate of rhythmic cadences, Ang Lee undertakes the Herculean task of bringing to the screen so English a work like this.<br /><br />And the end result was sublime. The repertoire is perfect, the scenery is simply mesmerizing, the accurate and incisive dialogues. Thus, Lee takes advantage of laying bare the background of social conventions so characteristic of the time and puritanical double standard that nested in every corner of the households is in Devonshire and London.<br /><br />Two sisters, impoverished after the death of his father in the flesh feel the stares, gossip and the scorn of a wealthy class in England in the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The performances of Emma Thompson, Tom Wilkinson, Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant added an extra touch to this superb production, I do not hesitate to include it within twenty great cinematic achievements of the decade of the nineties.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I was quite impressed with this game. Good graphics, cute music and sound effects.  Starts simple and gets challenging.  Every move counts.  Even in a large web your very first move could seal your fate if you choose poorly.  Still working through this so cannot comment on advanced levels.
B00004W50T|5.0|This album is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard!!!! You can tell that The Band put their heart and soul into this album. The Weight and I shall be released is two beautiful songs and my personal favorites on the album. The whole album even the bonus tracks are all good buy this album it wont disappoint.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Very surprised how much fun this turned out to be. The first few levels were very easy, then it gets increasingly more difficult. Fun!
B004V98UKS|2.0|Directional arrows are a nightmare. Uninstalled....Quell is a better game for a touchscreen puzzle! If you like solitaire try Pyramid. Happy gaming!
B004V98UKS|5.0|Would have been well worth the 99&cent; if it weren't free today. I like thinking games like this. Similar to aporkalips.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I had fairly low expectations going into this, given Matthew McConaughey's starring role. But I have to admit that I was impressed with the outcome. The writing was tight, the dialog compelling, and the plot was nicely done. I wound up enjoying the movie thoroughly.
B004V98UKS|4.0|Graphics are ok. Nice levels, not so simple that you feel like you're wasting your time. Controls are fine by me. I've played enough games with the same type of controls that I'm used to them. Would be nice if it was MoveToSD compatible though.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I haven't gone Blu-ray just yet and the CGI'd (ruined) versions of these classic films aren't going to get me on board either!  But that is neither here nor there since you can also buy these inferior releases on dvd!    I figure at the very least the new versions of Star Wars could be turned into one hell of a drinking game.  Get a group of friends together, get some booze (your choice), pop in your favorite; A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi; Then everytime you see one of Lucas' horrible/unnecassary changes everyone take a drink!  You could also make up other rules, like first one to say, \\"Dammit George!\\" doesn't have to drink but all others do!    I see many posting that the 2006 Special Edition dvds are one way of getting the original versions but why pay for that when all you have to do is buy the 1990 VHS versions (Glad I held onto mine!) because they are the same print!  Pan & Scan and 2.0 Dolby intact....Way to throw the fans a bone George!    I'm sure the HD picture on these is flawless but the added CGI scenes are unneeded and take away the \\"realness\\" that the original films had....Lucas is spending to much time trying to make the originals like the prequels!  He should have tried to make the prequels more like the originals!  And for all you Star Wars \\"fans\\" just think of how many more great movies/tv shows we could have if Lucas invested more time in that instead of farting around with the originals every few years!
B005EI86JU|5.0|Excellent reference for the D7000 and very complementory for the manual.  I liked the author's suggestions about setting's and why they should either be left as default or changed.  The Kindle book was excellent - All pictures matched the commentary.  Well worth the cost.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|excellent app keeps me busy. this app reminds me of cut the rope. awesome graphics and animations. this app keeps you busy
0307473708|5.0|I bought this book since I love the series I thought I'd give the books a try. OMG! I fell completely and utterly in love with the books (I already bought all 5 of them, waiting on #6 to be put on the market) I highly recommend this book. Jeff Lindsay is a superb writer, in my opinion at least.!
0061142700|5.0|Great Book! My son LOOOOVES it. It's such a simple story, but so calming to kids. I enjoy reading it to my son.
0470449748|4.0|I have the 1st edition and the 2nd has the same quality!<br />I would have liked to see a better variety of exercises. I mean if you get the Verbal or Math Guides and this, you're gonna see a lot of the same exercises! :/
B0034G4P8A|5.0|There are so many reviews on here, i'll keep this short and give a quick girly opinion on the story and Characters...         Just watched this with my boyfriend and I am stunned at how good this movie was!  The action is top notch, the special effects are incredible, the man who plays Thor is ripped to shreds (his muscles of course :D ), which is always a bonus if your a chick like me (or a man who swings that way ;) ), and the story is so deep it held my interest the entire time (and that's saying a lot!)!         I honestly have NO complaints about this movie, I didn't even want to get up to use the washroom while watching it, the story and characters sucked me in and never spit me out!           If you love a great story, a good amount of action, and enjoy watching buff men fly and kick some serious ass, get this movie, you can thank me later! :)        :)
0470449756|3.0|I have the 1st edition and the 2nd has the same quality!<br />I would have liked to see a better variety of exercises. I mean if you get the Official Guide and this, you're gonna see a lot of the same exercises! :/

B005LY4B0A|4.0|Great game. A puzzle game with a fun theme. It is extremely fun. One of the few games to give angry birds a run for their money!  The hint feature is great for those extremely difficult levels.
0786838655|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this book. The writing is clever, witty, and very original in its usage of ancient Greek myths and heroes. We also enjoyed the rest of the series.
0062060554|2.0|I was disappointed with this book. It was read on my Kindle (which I love).  I thought the story line was interesting, but the book was so slow and at times so boring. The characters were not very endearing or even interesting. I found myself wanting to be finished with the book about halfway through & kept waiting for it to get better.  It was quite redundant as the main character woke up everyday with no memory and had to be reoriented to her life.  That was tiresome.   I am surprised that there were so many rave reviews but I appreciate the fact everyone has different taste in books! This just wasn't my cup of tea.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|does what it describes. for using just a camera and a few easy shortcuts, they did a nice job. Htc incredible
0345529057|5.0|Loved the season 1 series on HBO.  My daughter suggested I buy all the first books since she got them on her kindle.  She sent me the link to this box set.  Very low price so I wondered if they were used and tattered, but I received brand new volumes enclosed in shrink wrap and now all I need is the time to read them all.
1451629184|5.0|Since Jaycee was found I wanted to know her story. Not from tabloids or some other author giving ideas but only from her. I was thrilled when I heard she had decided to write a book about her story. The story is heart wrenching. Jaycee doesn't hold back and let's us know, in detail, what she went through. She lets us understand how manipulated she was and why escape didn't feel possible. I thought she did a wonderful job at conveying her feelings and thought that the reflections she put at the end of chapters where very helpful in seeing how things were and how she sees them now. Near the end of the book where she is reunited with her mother made me cry so hard that I had to put the book down.<br />I'm so proud of Jaycee. Not because she survived physically but because she survived mentally. That is a task in itself. I don't know if I could have been able to. I also loved reading about all of the wonderful people who were there for her and her daughters when she was rescued. To know that these caring people all chipped in and helped her out warms my heart. A wonderful book and highly recommended.
B00242KCWS|5.0|really good hard guitars/bass/drums/,,,,,,,,,the vocals on this cd i purchased were very low,,,,either a recording studio matter or a deffective cd?,,,,,either way i was satisfied w/what i got!you get what you pay for.excellent tunes....
0938045695|2.0|First, let me say that I really did end up learning a lot because of this book. However, I did not end up learning a lot from this book.<br /><br />Pavel's ETK book would be a decent enough introduction to kettlebell training if it actually taught you how to do the basic moves that are in the \\"Program Minimum\\". The book recommends focusing on the kettlebell swing and the Turkish get-up (TGU) for the initial phase of your exercise program. This emphasis on whole-body compound movements that allow you to become strong is excellent.<br /><br />BUT, and this is a huge BUT.....<br /><br />In order to actually learn how to do a get-up properly, you have to buy Kettlebells from the Ground Up, which costs an additional $80+ - this is, quite frankly, utterly dishonest and a total rip-off. If the central theme of a book is to teach and program two primary movements, it should at least teach you how to do them correctly. Instead you get a bunch of marketing nonsense about how great the exercises are and not enough instruction on how to actually do them.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, these are great exercises, and I have come to really appreciate the \\"RKC system\\" - but the book simply doesn't teach you how to do them correctly.<br /><br />Save your money and learn how to do these moves from these two excellent youtube videos uploaded by RKCs:<br /><br />The hardstyle kettlebell swing demonstrated by Pat Flynn, RKC: [...]<br />The Turkish get-up demonstrated by Neghar Fonooni, RKC2: [...]<br /><br />Bottom line: The RKC system is great, especially for those with time constraints, but the book is simply a rip-off. There is much better free material out there on youtube produced by RKCs who actually care about their clients.
B004TB6GUY|1.0|worst album by black label society,man what a disappointment,i am such a big fan of zak and crew,but this was a total waste of cash.,,sorry bls.again this review systems sucks,but i'll play ball.
B004V98UKS|3.0|I dont know about the game quality, but it wont install on the bionic. please fix soon.<br /><br />here are some more words to reach the min of twenty.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I almost never write reviews.  I figure, meh, why bother, why should anyone care what I think?  I do occasionally make an exception, either for an unusually bad or good book/movie/game.    In this case, I'm happy to say, I'm writing one about an unexpectedly delightful movie.  Full disclosure: I like happy endings.  I read Roger Ebert to make fun of how he only likes depressing, angst filled movies.  I watch movies to relax, not be reminded about how horrible the world can be.    This movie was right up my alley.  I almost felt like a kid again, watching a superhero beat the bad guys again.  It was visually spectacular, some of the fight scenes made great use of super powers, the combat was well directed and fast, the characters were likeable, and even a couple of decent twists.    Really, that's the strength and weakness of this movie. It's a nostalgic movie, modeled after the lighter sci-fi films of the 80s and 90s.  If you're looking for dark drama, brooding anti-heroes, and possibly a depressing ending, this isn't the movie for you.  If you want a classic movie about the triumph of good over evil with some fun sci-fi battle sequences, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B005KH928E|5.0|Super-Fast and easy download! Product Perfect, This Mp3 is amazing! Amazon once more comes through with the best price! I Recommend this music A++++

1440503257|5.0|This book is absoultely wonderful! If you love Harry Potter and cooking, then you will love this cookbook! This book covers all of the Harry Potter foods mentioned in the book, except for butterbeer. It also includes interesting facts about the particular dish and an insert from the Harry Potter books, where the book is mentioned. I love to cook and I love Harry Potter, so naturally this is my go to cookbook. I have made several of the recipes so far, and all of them have turned out beautifully for me. You must try Harry Potter's frist birthday cake! it was the best chocolate cake I ever had!
B002RWKSII|1.0|This CD is crap. plain and simple. Wilson can't sing, the arrangements are cheesy and great if you have no musical ear or are tone deal. The harmonies are kind of fun, but otherwise, it totally sucks. If you think this is good Gershwin, you haven't heard the masters do it right. This is Gershwin for idiots. The band just goes through the motions and theirs no real feeling in this. Wilson needs to stop singing. His voice is as flat as fizzed out soda pop. He did great things once but maybe the drugs, age and other self-abuse have done him in. the album would have been at least listen-able if he had a good singer do the lead vocals.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|It is GREAT having Joey Belladonna back! Great album! They are back at the top of their game! Get the CD NOW!
B0053VKP8S|4.0|Product did exactly what I needed, convert a toslink signal from my television to an analog signal I could feed speakers elsewhere in the house. I did have a problem with the power supply (a common problem with small electronics, as I understand it). However, a quick call to the distributor resulted in a no-hassle replacement power supply shipped immediately and received within a couple days. Great support.
B0043GXYBO|4.0|The concept of the story was great.  I love all things vamp related and I love how the authors created a new way to see them.  Each author brings a unique view into this genre, and I am always impressed when a great concept is introduced.    A vamp high school, where truly only the strong survive, but you still have to deal with the typical issues facing highschoolers today...    I truly enjoyed watching Zoey grow into a strong heroine.  I instantly had a connection to her whereas when I first began reading Twilight I disliked Bella for being so mediocre.      I also enjoyed how magic is a part of the vamp lifestyle and it isn't just all about the \\"blood\\".  Again it is those little elements added to the story that make it just a bit more special.    I look forward to reading more in this series.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|I was one of the people who said that I would never watch this show. My sister rented it, and talked me into watching a few episodes. Needless to say, I kept watching. It is definitely not without its problems. There are a few annoying characters. The writing is pedistrian at times. These are blaring at points, but for every one of these problems there ia a huge twist or heartwarming moment that keeps me watching. Do not be fooled into not watching this show because of vampires in the title. The supernatural element is the best reason to watch.
1569242739|5.0|It's never a dull day with the 75 choices of cupcakes available to make in this fun and easy to follow recipe book. I'm not a vegan and neither are most of my friends but everyone loves these cupcakes. Vegan cupcakes are taking over the world!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|The second season of Castle does not suffer from a sophomore slump. The cases are more clever. The writing is solid. The acting is still exceptoonal. On top of that, there are 14 more episodes to boot. The high point of the season is no doubt the two parter \\"Tick, Tick, Tick and Boom.\\" Simply put, this show is great television and deserves many seasons to come. Support good television!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Awesome app! I think it could use a few tweaks, but nothing major.  Overall I love it and am using it right now to write this review.  Oh,  and love the prediction engine!!! Using tmo's mytouch 4g btw
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This show is one of my favorites. I liked it immediately. It also helps that Nathan Fillion is one of my favorite actors. He is perfect in this role as his quick wit and humor fits perfectly. Every cast member seems to be having fun, and that is the best thing for any show. This season is a bit short, but the episodes are still fun to watch. If you are a fan of police dramas buy this. It has a more lighthearted feel than others, and that is what I enjoy the most about it.
B005HG4C4C|5.0|This album is a return to the 1990s Dream Theater style, particularly to the style of Images and Words.  If you have been a Dream Theater fan since the 1990s and feel that they lost their edge in the 2000s, then this album is for you.  If you became a Dream Theater fan in the 2000s and if Train of Thought and Black Clouds and Silver Linings are your favorite albums, then this album might be less appealing to you.<br /><br />I, personally, am in the former category and I think that this album is absolutely brilliant.  James LaBrie's vocals are amazing, particularly because he rarely attempts to hit a high note simply because he can, which, in my opinion, can sometimes result in a screechy quality.  Here, he keeps his voice within a range of a few octaves that don't require him to strain at all, and this makes the vocals extremely smooth.  Petrucci and Rudess still show off their technical prowess but in a way that doesn't show off how fast they can play JUST to make a point; every instrumental piece fits into the larger picture and melody of the songs (well, okay, there's one section at the beginning of Lost Not Forgotten that's ridiculously over the top, but even THAT is so ridiculous that I break out laughing every time I hear it and don't care that it doesn't really fit).  Myung is more audible than in the past, and Mangini does an excellent job; his drumming is incredible but not \\"in your face\\" and doesn't dominate the song.<br /><br />One other point I want to make is that this album REQUIRES multiple listens.  The first time I heard it, I thought to myself \\"well, I like the style, but the music isn't really clicking with me\\".  After about 5 listens, I thought \\"wow...  this is incredible...\\"  There's so much going on that you don't really \\"feel\\" a song until you've listened to it enough times so your brain can sort of follow along, if that makes sense.<br /><br />I am really baffled by some of the negative reviews of this album; obviously music is a matter of taste and a lot of people don't like Dream Theater at all...  but if you are a fan of the band, and particularly a fan of Images and Words, I don't see how you could not like this album, particularly after multiple listens.don't like Dream Theater at all...  but if you are a fan of the band, and particularly a fan of Images and Words, I don't see how you could not like this album, particularly after multiple listens.
0545265355|5.0|A fantastically realistic creation of another civilization. Better even that that of of Dune. Highly recommended. And in something of a rarity, the second volume is even better than the first!
B005K15XR4|5.0|I love every track of this cd. It's a great pick-me-upper when you're running low on inspiration or motivation. I even workout with this too. Fast paced and super EPIC! I'd recommend this to anyone who loves epic tracks and movies. Download all the MP3s here. Definitely worth every penny. :)
0374158460|5.0|So beautifully written I found it hard to put it down. Most of all I gained so much insight into the thinking and behavior of younger generations. It is always so  hard to understand the generation (or two) behind you. But Franzen makes it clear that these generations are indeed focused and working to make their lives richer and better than those who came before them. So, now at least I can begin to understand. Franzen deserves all the kudo's that have been bestowed upon him. A rare gift and much appreciated here.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian's workout is as advertised. I haven't done it every single day due to travel committments, but I have enjoyed it tremendously and have been surprised at my ability to keep up.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|It's bad enough that GL won't give fans the original versions - these Blu Ray discs don't even work!  I tried them on a Sony (not exactly a no name or knockoff brand) player updated to the latest firmware.  I'm sure they would make great coasters, but I am returning mine.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I have a new game to play for the next few days..love the challenge which makes it really addicting. It's worth downloading &amp; since it's a free app for the day, give it a try..you might like it as much as I do.

B004QMW1NM|4.0|A little different than anything I usually listen to.  Tracks 1, 2, 4 and 7 sold me though.  Seems like \\"The Source\\" was in a movie or something, but I can't find any info on it.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Not the worse replica out there but it is the offical BBC one. The plastic seems strong enough but it has enough little bitty timey wimey parts that look like they could break easily. The \\"invisable\\" ink is pretty cool but they had to change the color of the light to make it work, making it quite inaccurate. They say that you can get pen refills but I have not seen them (and I bet they're expensive). The battery compartment is just plain stupid.. you have to remove the cover over the screw (it's the slider, so the cover is pretty much guarenteed to get lost) and then you have to remove the whole sliding part from the rest of the device. With all the room in this thing, it is quite a disappointment that they used expensive button batteries instead of AAAs. The sound is cool.. it makes two different ones.. but it is hard to hear unless it is pointed right at you.<br /><br />All in all, I would rate this at a $10-$15 toy.. but you know how \\"collectables\\" are. If you plan on buying it as a collectable, don't plan on being able to play with it and then put it back in the box.. it comes in one of those stupid blister packs.<br /><br />I guess that no matter what, sonics are cool.
B003EI2EH2|1.0|I was massively disappointed in this book. I have found enough errors and half truths in the book that I would have to view everything else written in the book as suspect. \\"Facts\\" like an hour on a stairmaster only burning 7 calories more than an hour watching TV... that just isn't possible. But the thing that really killed the book for me was using Dave Palumbo as a muscle mass building example. The guy went from 140lbs to 310lbs. Tim gives us a detailed account of his diet. WOW! GREAT! But oops! Tim forgets to make any mention of the fact that this guy also got busted for trafficking human growth hormone a few years ago. (just google \\"Dave Palumbo arrested\\") Secretely using human growth hormone (like Palumbo) to bulk, then telling me about your diet so I can bulk like you is a lie. Now regardless of how you feel about the use of illegal substances, I feel like the whole example in Tim's book is basically a fraud when he leaves out that part of the story. So how many of his other fantastic tales are tainted in such a way? Later in the book Tim discusses Ben Johnson the Canadian sprinter, he talks all about how his brilliant coach trained him in ways that maximized his recovery... again no mention of the controlled substances infamously involved that got Ben Johnson's Olympic gold medal revoked. If Tim Ferris wants to promote controlled substances that is one thing, but if he wants to brag about their results, BUT NOT MENTION THAT DRUGS WERE INVOLVED, that is just fraud. If the book at least seemed factual I could forgive the nauseating amount of product promotion within the text. It even contains convenient web links to where we can buy all these gizmos and supplements that we supposedly need to achieve his amazing results. How much did these companies pay for this type of product placement? Again, if you want to use a controlled substance to train, that is your business. But then don't turn around and try and sell me all the other products promoted in this book and tell me that is how you got your results. After reading this book I can't help but think that Tim is laughing all the way to the bank.     The price again is ridiculous, I bought it for $3.99 on ebay.com
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful movie! Each actor did a great job. I really loved Helen Hunt's portrayal of the mother -- such a loving and supportive family! You can see the strength and faith that enables the family to deal with this serious event, the physical loss of her arm, the emotional impact on all of them.  I highly recommend the movie and the book, \\"Raising a Soul Surfer.\\"

B003UESJH4|3.0|I enjoyed this movie in its demonstrating to us the difficulties in dealing with a handicap of this nature, the persistence to work on overcoming it, and the loving support of family that is so needed.   The one thing that was highly disappointing to me is that I purchased it with the intent of putting it in our Church Library for family viewing. I was unable to do this because of the use of slang for defecation and fornication that although our children may hear these words, and worse, it is unacceptable to me to promote a movie in our church that uses this language - however briefly. To me, that ruined an otherwise perfect movie, which I WOULD have rated as excellent.

B002ZG9940|4.0|\\"The American\\" is a foreign film.  Yes, the main character is American and over half the dialogue is English, but the structure, pace, plot, and script is decidedly European.  If you enjoy foreign films, you'll enjoy The American.  George Clooney plays a cold assassin seeking warmth and human connection in his life.  His struggle is immediately apparent as the movie intensely protrays the lack of trust and absence of intimacy an assassin must have to stay alive.  The women in the film are sexy and hot.  The scenery is beautiful.  The supporting characters simple and honest, sharply contrasting with the dark secrets pulsing through the American's veins.  The film builds nicely to the end but it might take a bit of discipline to stick with the film to the conclusion.  Things happen quickly as the film wraps up so it is worth sticking around.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I like watching true story's. This a touching movie about a football players life before he became a football player. So many times I wanted to cry over Big Mike.

I have a lot of respect for the Oher family who took Mike in.
0307454541|2.0|WARNING: CONTAINS PARTIAL PLOT SPOILER<br /><br />The opening pages and premise of this novel initially grabbed me, but after the first 75 pages or so, the writing becomes dull and sometimes awful, and the novel is chockfull of plot lines and developments that are contrived, convenient and mostly unbelievable.<br /><br />Before I jump into the specific details of some of the worst aspects of the book, I should point out that the author commits an unpardonable sin:  at the very outset of the book, the author inadvertently reveals a major plot twist that isn't supposed to be revealed for at least another two hundred pages.  The way it's done suggests that it wasn't intentional, which tells me that the author is either dumb or thinks you are.<br /><br /> The story focuses on two weakly intersecting plotlines: What and who caused the mysterious death of 16 year old Harriet Vanger decades earlier, and the moral and legal battle between the novel's hero, Michael Blomvkist, and a corrupt industrialist-financier named Wennerstrom.<br /><br />The storyline involving Harriet is initially the interesting one, and at least for a while portends dark and intriguing stuff. The subplot relating to Wennerstrom, sorry to say, is just boring, ineptly developed and painfully trite from the start. Unfortunately, the tantalizing possibilities regarding Harriet Vanger quickly give way to silliness. The details of what happened--and the horrific series of related events that the author describes, are contrived and implausible, and the wildly unlikely way our hero and heroine, hacker Lisbeth Salander, piece together what happened is even more of a stretch. Even worse, once Blomvkist and Salander piece together what happened, they decide not to reveal it to law enforcement, for reasons that the author explains but which, in the end, simply make no sense at all.<br /><br />The writing, too, is for the most part just plain awful.  We are often treated to mundane, irrelevant details, such as that our hero made a sandwich of pickled herring and mustard on a sourdough bread, when such things have nothing to do with the storyline or the character development. And when describing Wennertrom's empire the author dishes up some of the most clich&eacute;-ridden, awful similes ever to make their way into a \\"successful\\" novel:  \\"Wennerstrom's empire was like an onion; a labyrinth of enterprises owned by another. Companies, accounts, funds, securities.  They reckoned that nobody--not even Wennerstrom himself-could have a complete overview. Wennerstrom's empire had a life of it's own.\\"  I've seen writing from average high school students that was more artful and descriptive and less vague and general that that.  And again barely 30 pages later, we get: \\"This much-discussed empire was like a living organism that kept changing shape. It consisted of options, bond, shares, partnerships, loan interest, income interest, deposits, bank accounts, payment transfers, and thousand of other elements.\\"  Not only are these two descriptions of the empire painfully dull and unenlightening, but they sound as if the author borrowed them from a book report written by an 8th grader of marginal abilities and limited vocabulary.  The author's laziness in describing this financial empire is understandable, in a way.  The Wennerstrom subplot--though it consumes virtually all of the book's final 60 pages, is extraordinarily tedious and boring, and seems added to the story purely as filler. So it is no wonder that the author just slapped together a  way-too-long series of pages relating this storyline: who would care anyway?<br /><br />I should add that the one redeeming feature of this book is the heroine, Lisbeth Salander. She is an offbeat and potentially compelling character, and one can envision a novel focusing on her that would, in the hands of a much better writer than Stieg Larson, be worth reading.  Sadly, though, our Lisbeth is the creation, and hence the victim of, a very mediocre talent.<br /><br />One final one point. I have seen reviews favorably comparing this book to Silence of the Lambs. Don't be fooled. Silence of the Lambs was a meticulously researched and carefully crafter masterpiece of suspense and real-life horror.  This novel doesn't even begin to approach that level.views favorably comparing this book to Silence of the Lambs. Don't be fooled.

0393338827|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who is remotely interested in how our nation got into its recent financial predicament.  There is plenty of blame to go around - the rating agencies of Moody's, S&P and Fitch should be prominent.  The greed of Household Finance, Leyman Brothers, et al is enormous.  And the lack of understanding of the mortgage market by Wall Street is unfathomable.  The first 25 pages are difficult because one needs to learn a new language - default swaps, CDO's, CDS's, Bonds (different than \\"bonds\\").  Beyond the early pages, it reads like a novel, well told.  rbm

Peter is an excellent musician and performer. I would rate the concert 5 out of 5!
B0034G4P80|1.0|Negatives:   (1.) Confusing and not clear introduction of who the characters are and what the story is to become.  (2.) Very unimaginative dialogue - stereotypic and sophomoric. So how is it that creatures with technology thousands of years ahead and an unfathomable distance removed should sound and look like 21st century American Hollywood actors?  (3.) Copied Narnia and other fantasy movies with CGI of floating rocking cliffs and ocean/sea water that was too obviously CGI. Same old good god, bad god sibling rivals being sent to Earth and acting more like Neanderthals.   (4.) Worst acting of the year from men-in-black CIA plastic cutouts to, and especially Portman, who spent most of her time acting like a starry eyed teen checking out the bods of her costars. They in turn acted like typical Hollywood's versions of incompetent scientists and godly inhabitants of the other planets could have been better casted in a '30s slapstick flick.   (5.) Costumes that look like plastic Samurai armor with helmeted wings. In fact all the props had that shiny lucite/polyurethane molded look. Typical comic book non-functionality. All the buildings, settings and props had a stylistic overindulgence that only a cloistered comic book artist would think of. And the wormhole device looks like early 1900s art nouveau architecture. This is typical quickly put  stuff together to make a movie without much thoughtful writing & directing.   (6.) Story was a dishonor to classic Nordic myths which have more substance and depth to them than this copycat plot. Horses and lasers and flying through wormholes at multiple times the speed of light and then stop suddenly violates even an elementary student's knowledge of physics. Didn't the writers & director know that the National Academy of Sciences has movie advisors? Instead of an educational opportunity it's just more regressive educational cost cutting entertainment.
B005IFWXWU|4.0|I've been a fan of Hugh Laurie's acting from way back (Fry & Laurie, Blackadder, etc.). I don't watch \\"House\\" because I generally only watch shows with dead folks, animals, science related or anything that has to do with Bigfoot (don't ask!). I knew he had some musical capabilities, but not to this extent. Some reviewers have said they don't much like his singing voice. Well, not everyone likes everything. But for me, there's a quality in his singing voice that I really like. He's also a fine piano player.<br /><br />So if you like roots jazz, then check this out. There's some fine playing & singing all round.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0824835921|5.0|This is THE way to learn kanji.  Forget trying to learn like the Japanese learn.  They learn by brute force over a period of roughly a decade and a half.  With this method, you will learn to write the kanji and understand their basic meaning - and learn it within a month or two.  After that, learning the readings gets significantly easier.    Not only that, but Japanese starts to make sense once you can leverage Kanji.  That \\"word\\" that seems to mean 20 different things suddenly becomes 20 different words.  After even just halfway through this book, I started correcting Japanese friends when they used the wrong Kanji, or used kana because the kanji had slipped their mind.    Start here... then move on to a textbook that (1) has NO romaji (2) uses kanji with furigana.      Best of luck to you!
B004OKFIYU|1.0|Let me start out by saying that I am both a big fan of Billy Joel and Mobile Fidelity.  I've owned many MOFI discs over the years and loved them all.  Most of them are still in my collection.  This \\"remaster\\" of Piano Man has me utterly bewildered.  I know for a fact this Joel album was not recorded on the best equipment on a huge budget.  That being said, this version is unbelievable bad!!!    The whole recording sounds dull and lifeless.  There is nothing here to draw you into the rcording or to get your feet tapping.  Joel's voice sounded like it was coming from my bathroom down the hall rather than the speakers in front of me.  There were several instances where the sound level would drop suddenly for no apparent reason.  This is the first time \\"Piano Man\\" has sounded so lifeless and uninteresting.  This is a great album by Billy Joel that has been ruined by an unforgivable MOFI remaster!    Although I love MOFI, I cannot in good conscience recommend this SACD to anyone.  Buy the imported CD or even the inexpensive US release and save your money.    Mobile Fidelity if you read these reviews-what the hell happened here?  I hope this is just a one-off fluke, and not an indication of what's to come for your future SACD and vinyl releases!

B003ZSJ212|3.0|First off let me just preface this by saying I'm glad to have these on Blu-ray. The picture looks fantastic and the sound is the best I've heard in a long time.   Now the one and only complaint and it's a big one-  those bonus discs! the first two have technical coding problems which make them freeze up or in the best case appear choppy.    I did the firmware upgrade thinking it would resolve the issue but it did not. I returned the set 4 times to Best Buy hoping that would take care of it, but it did not. out of the 4 I returned 1 did not even have the booklet in it! There are some serious quality control issues with this set. I'll be contacting the 800 number tomorrow to find out more. be warned if you buy this set these problems may be there.

B0040JHLM2|5.0|I have been a Brooks runner since being recommended the Beast way back in the early 1990s for moderate overpronation, very wide (4E) and flat feet. Five years ago I started climbing, which has changed my feet, helping to re-build my arches as well as strengthening them, so I had less of a need for a control shoe for my now mild-to-moderate overpronation and I went to the Adrenalines about two years ago.    Currently I rotate between a pair of GTS 10s and a pair of GTS 11s and while both have been fantastic, the 11s are a cut above. They retain the support and lightness of the 10s, with added cushioning. Yes, it's subjective, but the 11s really do feel like a plusher ride than the 10s. They breath very well in our hot Aussie summers (air temp 35+ Celsius, surface temp 50+ Celsius) on baking surfaces. The conventional lacing system is fine, except that the laces don't tend to stay tight for very long anymore after having worn both versions through the wet of winter. This is easily fixed with new laces though and is certainly not a fundamental fault of the shoe at all!    The heel-to-toe transition of the 11s is superbly natural. I'm not a heavy heel striker and for me, they roll very smoothly. For a shoe that has this level of cushioning, road feel is also very good without being intrusive. I know exactly what each foot is doing through each step in my gait.    The only minor complaint I have is that the super-wide 4E fit only comes in white/red/black, whereas the Asics GT-2160 in 4E is available in three different colour schemes. Oh, second even more minor complaint is that Amazon don't have my size in stock at the moment, so I'm waiting on a re-fill so I can order two more pairs for our summer.    I have bought two pairs of 10s and two pairs of 11s from Amazon and each pair gives me about 400-450km. I am 78kgs and run between 30-40kms per week at 5-15kms per run, if that helps you to make some determination about the longevity of the Adrenalines. In the past 6 months, I have dabbled in a pair of NB 1226s, but they offered too much support, which led to some knee/shin soreness. I have considered the Asics GT-2160, but since I have zero problems with the GTS 11s, I'll be sticking with them for now to keep running happy!

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I'm the kind of person who prefers it when a movie based upon a book, accurately depict the book.

1439102813|5.0|This book felt completely real and had so many special moments and observations about life. I felt so sad at times, as when you are at a funeral of a loved one, but knew I was gaining wisdom about life, relationships and what truly matters. It reflects on what matters most, with the realization that all of us will pass away some day and have no control over how and when. When life is taken away slowly, as with someone with Alzheimer's, this women reflects, even in her shrinking mind, on what matters most to her and that some things cannot be taken away because they exist, not in her mind, but in her heart.     \\"The scientist in her believed that emotion resulted from complex limbic brain circuitry, circuitry that was for her, at this very moment, trapped in the trenches of a battle in which there would be not survivors. The mother in her believed that the love she had for her daughter was safe from the mayhem in her mind, because it lived in her heart.\\"    This book is somewhat reminiscent of the play Wit, by Margaret Edson, in which a brilliant professor is taken down by cancer and realizes how important love and relationships are as the doctors treat her with the coldness she formerly had treated her own students.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|The older I get, the more I am fascinated by history.  I sure never heard about Mary Surratt nor of any conspiracy related to the assassination of Lincoln nor of any attempted assassinations of his VP nor Secretary of State while I was in school in the 1960s.  This makes me wonder what else is missing from our American history books?! I think this film should be mandatory education for junior and senior high school students.  Dry facts and memorizing useless dates is no way to learn.  This film brings important history to life!  From this very case we now have section 1 of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. And that is a very big deal!

0385534639|5.0|I bought into the story, characters, plot, and the synergy of it all from the beginning.  I had no idea I was in need of such a good story when I picked it up and at each turn, I expected it to go darkly, turning the characters or their journeys into something evil or horrible.  But at every one of those turns, it was quite the opposite: the gothic, dream-like perfection of a great story kept getting better because the author made the better choice which moved things into somewhat awe-inspiring.<br /><br />This isn't to say the character and plot choices weren't the most difficult, but it was endearing to have a story that can be mysterious and unusual but also, quite surprisingly be a wonderful love story on all levels.  It was enchanting and I wasn't able to put it down all weekend which I can say was worth it, without regret.

031603441X|5.0|The picture I had and the picture I have of Keith Richards has changed quite a bit after reading this book.  I like the Stones, but didn't know too much about them.  I always assumed Mick was the main guy, and Keith was the elegantly wasted guitarist living the R'n'R lifestyle.  A character riding on the coat tail of Mick's hard work. I always though of him as high or drunk, not very articulate, and always wondered how he survive to be 68.  After reading the book I see he's very witty, charismatic and articulate in his own unique fashion.  He comes across as someone with integrity, unpretentious, and often quite profound in his observations.  And my biggest surprise was that Keith pretty much wrote all the music.  (Yeah I know, all the songs are credited to both, but I bought my first CD after reading the book.)  I guess the media likes to run with the outlaw/junkie image, but the picture I got was of someone who is a family man, hardworking, who quite often stayed up four nights straight working on songs.  I mean that's dedication.  Maybe he had to take little illicit substance to stay awake but it's all in the name of work.  Now that's worth putting down some dollars for more Stones music.  Go Keith Go!
030745455X|4.0|Great book, but it really is quite graphic.  And I think there are some cultural differences that make some bits somewhat disturbing in the US that may be less disturbing in the authors culture (like a 25+ woman having relations with a 16 year old boy).<br />For the most part, it is a well written, good plot that keeps you thinking/guessing.  It is well translated as well.  I recommend for adults only and not those who may be easily offended.  It's not just the language that is graphic.<br />For those with an open mind, if you like Mathematics, you'll love some of the details in this book!

B002ZG999U|3.0|Unfortunately most of this movie takes place at night in the dark. The soundtrack makes me wish I could see more clearly what is happening. During the opening sequence that takes place in the dimly lit interior of a ship, I said to my wife, &#34;I hope the rest of the film isn't like this&#34;. Unfortunately, it was. Most of the action scenes were at night in dimly lit places. All we could see were glimpses of arms and legs lit by muzzle flashes. For us, we would have enjoyed this movie so much more if we were able to actually &#34;see&#34; it. The only saving grace was that at least the explosions were well lit and &#34;some&#34; of the scenes were in daylight. I think I'll re-label this DVD &#34;soundtrack&#34;.

B002MU4NL8|5.0|This was one of the first few films that I watched together with my bride and I recall I got the tickets free for something or other and boy am I glad that I did as I probably wouldn't have seen it otherwise.  Such was the low-keyness of this true sleeper hit which like other simiar surprise sci-fi flicks [[ASIN:B000HIVOI2 Stargate (Extended Cut) [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B000F9RB9Y The Terminator [Blu-ray]]] has gone on to become one of my favourite films.  Now on blu-ray it has never looked or sounded better.  Perhaps being a Trekker myself helped me to truly pick up on all the inside jokes and spoofs of TOS although my bride enjoyed the film the first time she saw it and now after I've forced her to watch every single TOS episode together with me she now enjoys this film even more the second time around.  The special feature documentaries are also good making this an oddity in being a comedy that is still funny even after all these years.<br /><br />The great script helped but kudos have to go to the excellent cast some of which went on to even bigger things e.g. Rickman in the Harry Potter films and Shalhoub in \\"Monk\\" etc.  The aliens are hilarious and lovable and the special effects are really very good and look even better in 1080p.  A great comedy that rewards repeated viewing.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B001MYIXAW|5.0|yea that is a lot to be in one movie plus it also deals with the all alone feeling of the abuse victim Oskar his new neighbor  Eli and background weird habit and weird father of  Eli. Trying not to give away too much this movie needs to be seen by any who enjoys great story telling and bye the way the pool scene is a classic. Blue-ray has a few more deleted scene and is worth it if your are a fan of this  movie, when you watch the opening scene just remember nothing is as it looks to be, enjoy.
B000Q8QH0I|4.0|I have always been a fan of noir from the early such as [[ASIN:B0020MMRC0 The Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B00005JNG5 Double Indemnity (Universal Legacy Series)]] and the more recent [[ASIN:B000UAE7RW Chinatown (Special Collector's Edition)]] which this film closely resembles in some parts as it also addresses police corruption in California in the 1900s however this film is unique in and of itself.  The casting of relative unknowns at the time was daring but it paid off with fine performances from Australians Guy Pierce and Russell Crowe.  Kim Basinger fully deserved her Oscar for her work and special mention has to be made for James Cromwell's work too.<br /><br />As for the blu-ray itself while the picture and sound quality aren't reference-grade as far as the best I've ever seen in 1080p they are still very good and together with the excellent special feature documentaries does make this a great way to view a true film classic.<br /><br />Recommended for all fans of great film!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Thought the game was gonna be lame, but after first few levels became challenging and fun.  Def worth 5 stars, just hope developers will continue to add more levels.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|This is the lone birthday gift I received this year.    Star Wars came out in 1977. Not 1997.    I don't have any more words.... I'm ashamed I asked for this again. These versions of the film are purely awful.
0307279189|5.0|Born to run is an incredible read that is both informative and entertaining.  At times, McDougall is explaining the growing phenomenon of barefoot running, while at other times he develops some incredible characters that keep the reader turning pages.  I could not recommend this book enough.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Where are the theatrical cuts, come on money grab.  THis really is wrong on so many levels.  Not only is this cheap set irritating , it is also expensive
B004V98UKS|5.0|I thought that this would be a stupid easy game. I was wrong, I have not gotten far and it is making me think. It is a pretty fun time killer, installed and runs fine.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|the music on this album is consistently good throughout.  I'm sure most people will buy this album for \\"pumped up kicks\\", but I can't stop listening to \\"Helena Beat\\".  It's all very atmospheric, but has a good beat; Perfect for listening in a relaxed setting or at a get-together.  Why are you reading this? just buy it already.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|If you are a Star Wars fan you will love seeing them in HD.  I bought the set over the weekend and I must say that I am very impressed with the video quality.  Do not listen to all the negative reviews over the episode 6 change were Vader yells \\"NOOO!\\".  That is literally 2 seconds out of the entire 6 films.  To discount the entire film set in HD quality over 2 seconds is a bit fanatical.  The imagery is amazing and the sound is great too!
0345529057|5.0|Purchased these online through Amazon.com and read all of them in less than two weeks.  Couldn't put them down!  Although book four does slow down and adds a lot of unimportant descriptions of random things that made it drag a little.  All over, great series of books though.
B001TW68P4|5.0|Absolutely love this CD and enjoy the memories it brings back!  There were actually some songs on the CD that I knew and loved, but didn't realize they were sung by The Turtles!  The CD was reasonably priced and arrived quickly.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Really liked this game. Sad it is over. Worked well on my evo. No issues at all. I wish there were more mystery games available.
B004V98UKS|1.0|fun and simple, at first. then the fun starts to turn into repitition, and the simple only a little more than that. yes it may only be a buck, but it really isn't worth it. only recomended for the beginning puzzle solver, and even then you may lose intrest quick.
B005FNPIG8|5.0|\\"This is what he does best, and he is the best.\\"  A corrupt Interpol officer makes that observation about Roland Flint, the character depicted by Scott Adkins in the riveting \\"Assassination Games.\\"  The accolade truly applies to the film's star Jean-Claude Van Damme, who has translated his experience as a global superstar into becoming a superior actor in the action films genre'.  \\"Assassination Games\\" is another example that the original \\"Muscles from Brussels\\" has evolved into a creative force behind fast-paced movies that are both character-driven and visually stylish without resorting to CGI tricks or the usual action movie cliches'.  JCVD depicts Vincent Brazil, who becomes a reluctant partner with Flint in a cat-and-mouse game against both Interpol and relentless members of a European mob.  Brazil's relationship with an unlikely girl-next-door named October provides the dramatic anchor for a tense mix of tragedy and revenge.  When October kisses Vincent on the cheek for his kindness toward her,  Van Damme depicts the hitman's resistance to affection with a truthful emotion that is both telling and heartbreaking.  It is just one of many moments, both quiet and explosive, in \\"Assassination Games\\" that demonstrate JCVD's superiority as an actor in action films today.
B002C6A6FY|5.0|It's such joy to see this great movie again. I've seen it as a very young person and I don't know if I appreciated all it subtle quality. The writing is phenomenal and so are, of course, the stars.   It's timeless and will always remain one of the best Hollywood movies.  I really enjoyed the documentaries on disk two - that was a very revealing and interesting addition to the movie !
1416950176|5.0|Great book. Draws you in from the beginning. Quick and easy read that works well with my fourth grade students.

0425241505|5.0|I was really excited to start this series. It was getting major praise from book bloggers, and by the title alone, I knew there was going to be a great mix of paranormal/fantasy beasties found within the pages. I recently voiced wanting unique/uncommon paranormal beasties in books, so I was really interested in what this author might present. She didn't let me down! This world is home to a Dragon, Fae, Elves, Gryphons, Gargoyles, Thunderbirds, Harpies, Goblins, Nightkind (Vampyres) and more. It's quite a smorgasbord and I loved it!<br /><br />Alpha males are hot, right? You agree. Don't lie. Well, Dragos is about as Alpha as one can be. This Wyr (a collection of shapeshifting beasties) is as old as the earth, with an ego the size of the planet and a personality as hot as the sun. He's the leader of the Wyr demesne. He doesn't ask questions. He commands. Without saying thank you.<br /><br />\\"In a way, that meant he embodied all stages of evolution at once - beast and predator, magician and aristocrat, violence and intellectualism. He was not so sure he had acquired humanlike emotions. He had certainly not acquired their morality. Perhaps his greatest achievement was law.\\"<br /><br />Ok, so I'm making him sound like a big ole jerk. He's not. He just had to tap in to his touchy-feely side, which he does quite magnificently...<br /><br />...all because of Pia. Sweet, fierce, independent Pia, who becomes quite a mystery to all. I won't giveaway her true identity because it was magnificent to discover. She has a few tricks up her sleeve, as well, as she she broke into and stole something from a supposedly hidden, impenetrable hoard of goodies owned by a hot-headed dragon. Needless to say, he hunts her down to punish her, and when they meet, he realizes that he really does want to punish her. *wink* Ok, I'm being slightly dirty now but seriously, Dragos and Pia = Epic Smex. They move mountains, people.<br /><br />Of course, there is great action in between all the mountain moving, and our two lovers find out that they really do make one hell of team. Dragos has quite an enemy in Dark Fae King, Urien, and soon enough, Pia finds herself smack in the middle of their epic war. Together, Pia and Dragos battle goblins and Dark Fae and ultimately, Urien himself. Urien, you're going down, bud! Oh, speaking of the Fae, I must profess my love for Tricks, aka Thistle Perrywinkle. She's Dragos' Fae PR rep, and she is a hoot! She delivers some great snark and I knew she would be a favorite of the series. Plus, the tight knit unit that makes up Dragos and his team are just all awesome. What a family!<br /><br />All in all, the plot is really intriguing and well thought-out, fast paced without leaving you in the dust, and dang entertaining. The characterization was fantastic. It was pretty awesome to see Dragos learn something new about himself at his age. You can teach an old dragon new tricks! The progression of Pia and Dragos' relationship was sweet, romantic and heartbreaking at times, while remaining very believable. I really enjoyed the world building and thoroughly look forward to learning more in future books. Thea Harrison is a breath of fresh air in the genre!at they really do make one hell of team.

1439181780|5.0|Easy to read, easy to refer back to, a wonderful addition to my life.  I first read this book when I noticed it at the library.  It was so powerful to me, that I took it back to the library and ordered three copies from Amazon, one for me, and two for people I love who would really benefit from the insight of the book.  This book was more powerful for me than the Secret. Opening your mind and your heart to all the good in the world, and keeping it focused there, really does make your life so much better....and this book is my constant guide and reminder to do just that.  It is true, you can't just put blinders on to bad things that happen, or difficult physical problems, but the way you deal with it can make all the difference. I love this book!!
B004UBM4TA|5.0|If you have an interest in astronomy and shuttle program then you will love this.  I bought this at a local Best Buy for $34.95 instead of the price listed here.   Check out your local stores first.
0380804557|2.0|This is one of the few cases where I actually recommend watching the movie instead of reading the book. Maybe it's because I fell in love with the movie many times before reading the novel, but I just felt that the book was rather... odd. And not in a good way, like the movie is odd. Also, the ending is abrupt and anti-climactic, although I won't give any specific spoiler details.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Neil Gaiman, you might enjoy this book, but i really would recommend seeing it portrayed in film. They took a mediocre book and made it incredible.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Absolutely amazing! Defines my generation lol. Filled with a bunch of extras that are worth the price. 5 stars across!!
0385534639|2.0|Constantly skirting issues quickly becomes tedious and is not suspenseful, it's simply annoying.  I could not get beyond half-way through.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors is a bit of an odd duck in the America market: it's what would be called a 'visual novel' over in Japan, interspersed with liberal bouts of Professor Layton-esque puzzle solving.  It's good.  Quite good.  The story certainly merits the game's 'mature' rating.  That's not to say that it is in any way inappropriate; rather, the rating comes down to some philosophical meanderings and some descriptions of grotesque violence that probably wouldn't work for younger gamers.    I do have a few gripes with the game: to get the most out of it, you must replay it several times, and while you can skip the text of the story that you've already read, it forces you to re-solve some puzzles multiple times.  Still, it's a rewarding title - enough so that I put in almost 20 hours playing it to its true conclusion.  Take a chance on this one.  It's not for everyone, but you may just wind up loving it like I did.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|The ui will be familiar to angry birds fans but the similarities end there.  This game is a real problem solver that would be great for kids.
B00139XZF4|4.0|My husband and I like watching this movie. It has a very interesting fantasy story line and good actors to top it off. The good story line is also supported by action and possibly a second part?
0865479186|5.0|This is a wonderful, angry, ranty book that educates and entertains, and ultimately leaves you sad that the world is the way it is, and wanting to change it.     I have read some good works on critical thinking and on science, and this book is right up there with the best of them. Ben Goldacre works in the NHS and the science he is talking about is unashamedly the science of healthcare - but the points he makes about understanding scientific reporting and spotting quackery applies in other fields too.     Indeed it was very refreshing to read a book attacking bad science, and defending reason that focussed on such real world and downright useful subjects as how to answer someone who thinks MMR jabs cause autism, or who thinks eating spinach will oxygenate your blood.     I thought I was usually reasonably good at spotting bad science, but putting the book down and picking up today's paper I was immediately struck by two stories I would normally have quicky forgotten, and was left suspecting that both are very inaccurately reported.     Bad science is all around us, and in this book you can sharpen your skills at spotting and refuting bad arguments. The only people who will hate this book are people who think that \\"there are more things in heaven and earth...\\" and thus we should never discount homeopathy (or crystals, or tarot or whatever) just in case they work by some mechanism we do not know.     (And the message of the book to those people is - fair enough. But there is simply no evidence that the *do* work at all).     The only down sides of this book are the writing style. It is open and amusing, but sometimes some people might feel it grating a little. I didn't - I liked it, but I would understand if others felt differently.     Moreover, there writing was sometimes a tad opaque. I found myself re-reading some paragraphs because the book was so chatty that sometimes the author repeated himself and at other times he seemd to assume his point was clear before hehad quite finished writing it. It is a minor criticism, because for the most part the author has done an admirable job of making science and the scientific method clear and understandable.     One last criticism - had I been explaining the material in this book, I would have covered much sooner the issues of prabability and chance, and the point that even where there is no effect to be discovered, 1 in 20 experiments attempting to show the effect (or rather, to disprove there is no effect) will come up with positive results merely by chance.     He does mention this in a very good chapter on statistics. It is just that it was relevant earlier, and even when mentioned it is not a point he labours.     Again a very minor criticism for a very good, readable and enjoyable work that is thoroughly recommended.

B0050QV0RQ|4.0|As a big fan of classic 16 bit RPG's I have been searching the App Store for something that would fit in this genre. I have had the game for about a week now and I cant stop putting it down. Now that the app saves to SD I strongly recommend anyone who loved RPG's on SNES, GEN, TG-16 pick this up.
0810993139|5.0|This is a good fun read. A story written in the form of a middle school boy's diary (or journal as he would prefer it to be known) complete with his own cartoons which are a perfect and hilarious counterpoint to his authentic pre-teen voice, that says so much by leaving out so much!     There are various cultural references that a non American reader must interpret - usually with an eye to what we see on movies. I think middle school is like 11-14 or something, but no doubt an American reader of this comment can correct me if I am wrong.     I loved the way this book gets into the head of the boy who writes it though. Things like \\"The Cheese Touch\\" or the naming of your racing cars with rude words and such like to put off your opponent are just so reminicent of that age.     What I particularly enjoyed was the way memory and imagination can fill in so many details. The boys in one class end up making a list of rude words they don't want their robot to say. Not only was that a hilarious scene, but I could also imagine being there, and I could imagine all the conversations and hilarity that would surround that list. The description is brief but somehow it brings out so much more.     All in all this is a perfect book for 8-13s or so, and indeed anyone who remembers what it was like to be that age!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Great app, much better than stock. Note that although the store says it is not optimized for Honeycomb, it does still work very well with it - don't let that put you off.  The only (very small) issue is the lack of resizable widget (which is a Honeycomb update feature).
B004V98UKS|4.0|got it for free through amazon app store. worth a try. getting used to game. seems like it will br challenging. Evo4G
0307887898|4.0|I'll give this four stars for effort, three for expectations, or a 3.5 overall.<br /><br />If I had to summarize the message of the book it would be that we have been putting the cart before the horse, and going all in before we even know if what we are doing is relevant, needed or possible.<br /><br />That's a good message! Maximum speed via an experimental feedback loop to get signals to steer you in the right direction until you find a viable business model before you over commit. Of course that idea will help you continue to grow in the right direction as well.<br /><br />The whole concept is worth exploring and thinking about (a lot!) but the content was fairly high level vs. get your hands dirty with specific implementation how-to details, perhaps that was intentional but it will leave you wanting more.<br /><br />A lot of the book seems to be geared towards convincing the reader that the Lean way of doing things is the right way of doing things.  Fair enough since this approach is a 180 degree departure from the way most startups approach the process currently, still I felt that it was overdone and ended up detracting from the book, if you bought the book you probably have an open mind after all.<br /><br />The problem is that if you want to actually go out and start applying this in a real world situation it's going to be up to you to figure out exactly how to make your own specific feedback loop( outside of the conceptual framework anyway ) and that might be more of a daunting task than just cowboy'ing it (the typical startup approach)  The information and tools are out but you will need to dig, research, and figure how to put it all together yourself.<br /><br />Is it worth a read?  Sure, but don't expect to hit the ground running after reading it, this is more of primer on the Lean methodology (if that label can even be applied) rather than a how-to guide.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Very pleased.  At first problems in recognize, Bios Lock Up, I had to update Bios in GA-MA785GMT-UD2H Gygabite Board to F6 Version using meanwhile another processor (Athlon II X2 250), but then everything comes to Life.   Smooth performance consuming less than 50 percent of performance when playing Crysis 2 at full,  comparing a 70 percent when I had Phenom II X4 965.   Better 3D Mark results and also and improved CineBench result.   Definetely 6 cores works better than 4, eventough 4 acomplish the task, but this Thuban X6 also heats less for about 20 degrees, with the same heatsink.  Good value, performance for the money.
B004V98UKS|5.0|This is a nice puzzle game app. It doesn't claim to be anything else. Free, good &amp; functional. Might even be worth $1.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I disagree with most of the reviews I read that are poor ratings. For one, like Ewan McGregor said when getting the part, it's STAR WARS!! Be happy it was created in the first place.     Secondly, I love all the movies and am a huge fan. I do not mind all the changes/additions Mr. Lucas made to the Complete Saga. It is his creation, and like many artists, if you have the need and ability to make your art as you wished it to be but were not able to do it originally, then why not adjust it? I do not think the changes/additions made degrade the quality of any of these films.     If the diehard fans dislike these adjustments and enjoy the original theatrical release versions, don't purchase the BluRay version and stick with VHS or laserdisc...or whatever was around when you first saw them back in the 70s/80s. I, for one, enjoy newer technology and enjoy the Star Wars saga keeping up with it. To have all six films in one package and to be of amazing quality is great in my opinion.
B003UESJDI|5.0|A quiet English village seems like a good spot for a writer's workshop run by a successful novelist and his wife who minds their farm and cooks up a storm.  But beneath the surface of the rural quiet, things are bubbling.  The novelist is as adulterous as the hero of his potboiler novels, as he fools around with the young woman writer Tamara Drewe who has returned to her native village.  The cozy life of these villagers, however, is upset by Tamara taking up with a popular rock star and drummer.  This rhythmic snogging and shagging get the attention of two teenage girl fans of the drummer, who go so far as to sneak into Tamara's cottage and email the drummer on her password-unprotected computer (once he has left for his London flat) in order to entice him back to the village and Tamara's bed.  The girls' \\"messing\\" with Tamara and her life ends up turning over the whole applecart--with hilarious results!

0553801473|2.0|After reading many of the reviews of people who did not like this book, I would sum my own feelings up as: \\"all the above.\\"<br />My sense is that Martin stands on the precipice of either becoming the next Tolkein, or the next Jackie Collins.<br />I've read many of the opinions of his traditional fanbase who don't want to see ANY romance, like the darkness of his stories, and revel in heroes dying while the bad guys live, chalking it up to anyone who dares ride off into the sunset will smack of cliche' and hum drum. They basically are daring Martin to do anything akin to \\"happy.\\"<br />Scary.<br />I've also heard them say that \\"Martin is teaching us something here.\\"<br />With all due respect, I don't need teaching. I've seen enough of life to know that life is full of blessings and curses.<br />Thanks Martin, don't need anymore life lessons.<br />It's also my hunch that the people of this pseudo, Medeval period felt love, passion and joy more keenly than us, BECAUSE life was so brutal. Theres a little something lost in us Modern folk when we have so much without the epic struggles they endured.<br />I've read Moorecock, and Herbert, and they aren't works to inspire a trip down happy lane, but they had balance, and if not justice, resolution, which is what I feel his current trend is lacking. I was exhausted going from one chapeter to the next, and wondering when the next needless cliffhanger, and gratuitous twist would hit.<br />Please, enough with the baby switching, and the people we thought dead really aren't, and the ones who shouldn't be are, etc.<br />One, or two is enough. I can accept Aegon since his re-introduction seems consistent with original intent, and at this point, I wouldn't be surprised if he does kill a key character who shall remain unnamed just so he can prove \\"no one is safe.\\" However, all this literary pivoting is starting to sound cliche' in itself.<br />If Martin changes things up, (as some have suggested), because he doesn't like people guessing his original intent, then that smacks of just spite, and can lead to the unravelling of a very intricate storyline, thus getting away from him.<br />Also,my observation of Martin's mystique as being one of the most original writers is questioanable.<br />Talk about people fearing the cliche,' Martins characters sound a bit \\"familiar.\\"<br />Whether done from admiration, or not, Martin has \\"borrowed\\" from Michael Moorcock, Frank Herbert, Mario Puzzo, and History itself. But especially from Moorecock- Silverhaired dragonlords with unearhly beauty?, almost albinoish?<br />Sound familiar?<br />(And I would not fault him for \\"borrowing,\\" because we are influenced by those who come before us, or those who are our peers), but don't pretend you aren't borrowing.<br />I don't dislike Martin, and actually liked his stuff,(with the disclaimer that I really thought there would be the promise of a satisfactory summation and conclusion at some point UNTIL I heard that that may not be so, because he is writing adult fantasy afterall, and as adults we like as much \\"gritty\\" negativity as possible).<br />However, all that said, I would suggest, in his defense, that the youth of his characters point out the brutal fact there was no such thing as a \\"childhood\\" the way we understand it today. And as a female, I know that girls did indeed get married and had kids by fifteen and sixteen, because they were likely dead by thirty-five, or forty- even the highborn ones. And males were leading armies by sixteen, such as Richard III.<br />But, in the end, perhaps his works are not for people like me, who know that in REAL LIFE, there is balance,(even Richard III is getting his day in court after centuries of being the ultimate bad guy), and Martins insistence on the cynical just strikes me as hypocritical, given his own life is a fairy tale. If HIS fantasy world is that unbalanced, then count me out.<br />I have heard rumors that Martin actually is an unabashed romantic, and we might be in for the Happiest Ending to end all happy endings.<br />Right now, I just want to stick my head in the oven.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Well, Jimmy Pate makes this film come alive. Something about the touch of stringed instruments is sensual, commanding-even a weapon of war or protest. It can make you dream, fall in love, remember lost love, observe the love that past you by-it all comes from the heart.  And elder statesman of the guitar, Jimmy Page selects 2 guys who have completely different styles. Are they good? Yes, in their own way-they are killers and very passionate. What I liked was the humor and self-deprecating manner. The wit, the smiles, the 'oh yes...I get it-how lovely\\", feelings and the mutual admiration. Watch Page, as he studies the \\"Young Turks\\", with the smile and penetrating eyes.    Jiimmy Page is generous with his secrets, as time permits. White and The Edge, warm to Jimmy's candid take on music and how he shrugs off tunes like, \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", as he does a nice demo on his double-neck Gibson SG with a 12 string and 6 string neck.    This has to be one of the best guitar (and even if you don't play) and most enjoyable DVDs on music. Nice to see, the musical roots that Jack White explains, in his musical development.   Imagine installing a custom harmonica microphone for his vocals that pulls right out of the body of a modified guitar he designed. And the distortion with melodic overtones, on Jack's voice, is   something to behold. All three men, are highly intelligent (Page really shines here) and creative composers.    This is superior to any concert film you may see, because it is personal and intimate. Watch the expressions of the other two, while one makes his  narrative. Yes, turn it up loud, own it, but here is the big point-watch it multiple times. The brain cannot simply absorb all that is going on here.  Einstein said 11 times to understand even the basic ideas. I would say 30 times, to really get into what this music documentary is trying to say. And  Lord, it is beautiful.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|This movie is awesome. I have all the other movies and books, as well. I wanted the movie fast and got it the day after it came out. I will preorder part 2, too. In my opinion, this movie is more like the book than some of the previous. I enjoyed that. I prefer movies that were first book, be like the book. I realize that most movies would be too long if everything was put in them but I was very pleased with this movie.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Man, such negativity here.  I've watched very closely every single edition of Star Wars released to the public including 4x3 VHS, 16x9 VHS, 4x3 DVD, 16x9 DVD, the rerelease from the late 90's of IV, V, & VI, as well as I, II, & III as released on DVD.  I can tell you that the video and audio quality on this edition in phenomenal assuming you have the right equipment.  I'm sorry some of you don't like Mr. Lucas' changes.  Are the disruptive for those of us who have seen some of the episodes hundreds of times?  Maybe, but get over it.  The pros FAR outweigh the cons.      For $80 you get 8 discs with an unbelievable amount of extra material.  Do the math.  The junk movies released 2 months after theatrical release today cost $20-$25 each and are not written, acted, or produced to the quality of these 6 wonderful movies and yet this box set cost you $10/disc.  Show me why it's not worth it.  Simply put, if you'll allow your mind to embrace the vision that is George Lucas' you will likely be VERY happy with this set.  If, on the other hand, you're going to nick pick this apart and whine about every little thing order some cheese and let the rest of us enjoy this edition.

B004Y1USV2|3.0|I just got this and listened to it all the way through. Very enjoyable. The \\"Fly From Here\\" suite is pretty awesome with lots of interesting parts and variations on the melodies and themes. Not quite sure yet what the lyrics are about. Seems like a story about an haunted abandoned airfield. Fly From Here Pt. II talks about \\"empty corridors\\" and how \\"Only ghosts are in the empty corridors.\\" Maybe some kind of purgatory. I've come and gone with Yes a few times now. For me the best is still the amazing run of \\"Yes Album\\" through \\"Yessongs.\\" But I very much enjoy many of their other albums. I drifted away after \\"Yessongs,\\" but came back with \\"90125,\\" then lost interest again after Big Generator. Then they caught my attention again with \\"The Ladder\\" and I've bought everything since. So where does this fit in? It's different, but every Yes album is different, that's for sure. I'll listen to this plenty I'm sure.
B00003CXE7|3.0|I am a big fan of Ridley Scott, but I think this is one of his worst films.  On the positive side, this film has the unique atmospherics that you expect from his productions, the acting is strong, and he strives to inject interesting historical themes into the plot.  However, given that I have loved so many of his films, this one disappointed me.  I guess I could say its effects are so spectacular that Scott thought he could coast on them, that the film's content and characters have a laziness about them that I would not expect from a great filmmaker like Scott.  The characters are two-dimensional, the action is hardly realistic, and the themes so maudlin and milked for effect that it disgusted me at times.<br /><br />In addition, as a Rome history buff, I admit that I am put off by the wildly ridiculous inaccuracies in the film.  It's just an action film, so I can imagine viewers who liked it would tell me to lighten up.  Scott makes it into a discourse on democracy - Marcus Aurelias' general wants to bring back the republic, Commodus wants it to stay an autocracy - when it was nothing like that; the republic had been dead for over 100 years.  Moreover, removing the insane Commodus solved nothing:  Rome headed into a catastrophic period of instability in the passage of power, yet the film makes it look like that was all that was needed.  Granted, I suppose I should look at it purely as an action film, and it is a good action film, with blood guts, and daring.  The trouble is, I saw and loved The Duellists, one of his early films, so I know that he can pull off an absolutely first rate historical film, with realistic and yet unusual characters, without glaring make-believe, and deep themes that stick with the viewer, in my case for decades.  I was hoping that this film would be similar, and it certainly could have been.  Instead, it is a crude formula film, though lavish in production.
0525422943|4.0|I've been thinking about this novel for a few months now, reflecting on the story and my reaction to it...and in the end, I realized that Where She Went must have been pretty spectacular to remain in my thoughts for so long.<br /><br />After three long years, Adam and his band are on top of the world and he's a famous rock star. But despite how great everything seems, Adam's less than thrilled with his life. Even his relationships with his band-mates aren't what they used to be. Everyday, he runs through the motions of his rock-star life while staving off nervous breakdowns with a bottle of pills. Honestly, it was so heartbreaking to read Adam narrative and to see his character so sad. Even with Mia's appearance, the changes in her both pleased and saddened me as I followed Adam's narration.<br /><br />Forman's writing evoked different emotions in me with words that were poetic, beautiful, and heartbreaking. It is so easy to get lost in the story and emotion of Where She Went, and to just let the pages turn as the story unfolds. The story itself takes place quickly, for the most part in a matter of a full day, as Adam and Mia spend time trying to understand each other, themselves, the past, and coming to terms with each of their futures.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS: Adam's voice is achingly familiar, yet fresh and compelling - I was worried he would sound like Mia. However, Adam is different, broken in a different way than Mia once was. And thankfully, he still has some of his lovable charm and humor. I love how Forman shows how her characters have changed in three years, how they've evolved and grown. Even though it was initially a challenge for me to dive into Adam's mindset, Adam's words and the emotion behind them resonated with me long after the final page.<br /><br />LOWLIGHTS: The first half of the novel was difficult to get through because Adam really is in such a down place, and not entirely the man he used to be. It's difficult to see a character you adore be in a place like that. But, the last half made everything worthwhile.last half made everything worthwhile.

B0034G4P80|3.0|I didn't hate this movie, but I certainly didn't love it either.  It's basically an action movie, obviously based on Viking mythology, with a small romantic subplot tucked in there.  On the positive side, the graphics are pretty good, the acting is acceptable, and the movie did tend to hold my attention.  But on the negative side, it's a rather shallow movie when it comes to saying anything interesting or useful about the human condition, and there are some plot flaws which are nearly bad enough to undermine the whole movie.  In summary, this movie could be a decent choice if you really like this genre, but otherwise you won't miss much if you skip it.

B0043A0PXU|5.0|It is quite refreshing to hear a Christmas album that doesn't sound mainstream. The mixture of traditional English carols with African musical influences, even tribal-sounding at times, is quite brilliant. The vocal arrangements mixing Annie Lennox's voice with the African choirs are very effective. The 7th chords all the way through \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\" are just one of the many unique musical elements of this album. The war-like drums on \\"Lullay Lullay\\" create what may be the first proper musical setting I've heard for the tragic story of this song. It is clear that Ms. Lennox took a long time thinking through this recording and I appreciate the care with which she handled the source material. Above all though, the finest feature of this album is that all but one of the songs are sacred and point us to the grandest reason we celebrate Christmas. Thankfully there are no chestnuts to be found here.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|It is a nice app. A good alternative for itunes but on our phones. It comes with player that can use our files, not always buyed on their shop. But, there is a very big issue of this app - some users cannot use it, even if they live, earn and spend their money in UK. and this is why, becouse this app only accept english language in our phones. We are living in free world, and not everybody that live in UK have English on their phones, if they can chioce something else. So, when you get different language (becouse you prefer it) you will not be able to use it. thats very big issue, becouse this users can buy music from their computers, that are also in diferent then english language, but on their phones NO!
B002UNMW7O|3.0|In \\"The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day,\\" the sequel to the original \\"Boondock Saints\\" from 2000, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus play two scripture-spouting vigilantes in Ireland who return to the states - where they have achieved near-folk hero status - after a priest friend of theirs is murdered to make them look like the killers (the shots to the back of the head and the pennies left on the eyelids being the hallmark of the boys' work).  You see, eight years back, the boys took out a number of Boston mobsters and now the latter are trying to smoke the killers out to get their revenge.  The brothers are joined in their endeavors by a dimwitted, lachrymose sidekick named Romeo (Clifton Collins Jr.), whom they meet on their trans-Atlantic voyage, while an icy-cool FBI agent (delightfully played by Julie Benz) and a bevy of bumbling, corrupt law enforcement officials work on solving the case.<br /><br />This odd little mixture of smart-alecky humor, stylized, cartoonish violence, and crime movie melodrama is often more \\"clever\\" than it is funny, with its concepts and intentions often out-performing its execution, coming dangerously close at times to being Tarantino-Lite.  Still, there's enough style in writer/director Troy Duffy's hurdy-gurdy, postmodern spin on the genre to make the movie eminently entertaining and watchable.  And the arch performances delivered by a large and gifted cast - including Billy Connolly and Peter Fonda as two-long term enemies and rivals - add to the spirit of fun.<br /><br />It doesn't really amount to a whole lot in the long run, and it's never quite as fun as it thinks it's being, but \\"The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day\\" does have its entertaining  moments.

B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I've seen the Jane Eyre with William Hurt, Timothy Dalton, and the 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version, and this one is my favorite by far. The script gets us to the heart of the story in the best way by spending very little time on the side stories, yet building up the character of Jane Eyre before she meets Rochester. Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre and Michael Fassbender as Rochester are excellent. The feel of the location and time (and accent in most cases) are beautifully rendered. The cinematography and music were equally as excellent as the writing, directing, acting, background, and costumes in this beautiful version of the book. I loved the book, and I loved this movie.

B005974CNA|5.0|It's a really different band. I've been a fan & follower for many years.  Loved most of it but there always seemed to be an aftertaste of being talked (played) down to.  Seemed every musical phrase was either overplayed, overacted or as if the guys were saying \\"Let's make sure the audience gets this part.\\"  The best Progressive music treats the listener as somewhat savvy.  Like-- every crescendo does not require a huge cymbal crash or drum fill.  With Prog, less is always more and this Band seems now to have found out what this means....in an old Yes or King Crimson vein.     This piece is filled with implied musicality and allows the listener a nice break form the prior jam packed crowded fare. It is just an experience that is really enjoyable and yet has a perfect balance of tension & adventure. Of course, sick, sick playing chops (good), but this puppy breathes and lets the listener breathe too.  Super musical...Bravo & Thanks.
4789009637|2.0|A 2nd edition of this book has been released and trust me it's 100% better than this version, DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!!!!    This original version used a fair amount of very outdated vocabulary, expressions and even some elderly grammar points while skipping over the modern day equivalents COMPLETELY. It also did not fully/ appropriately explain some grammar. The practice section is now more expansive in the 2nd edition with more communication and conversational tasks. The accompanying audio CD is now included with the new textbook instead of sold separately and it's all on a single disk this time. Although not essential, it even has \\"Culture Notes\\" pages, which are actually extremely helpful for people who are actually planning to put their language skills to use abroad in Japan.       PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS OLD VERSION, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE STILL SELLING IT!

B0034G4P94|3.0|I went to see Warrior on my birthday last week because 1) I heard this was basically \\"The Fighter with kicking\\" and I enjoyed The Fighter a lot and 2) I wanted to see how Tom Hardy would pull off a physically imposing role with him playing Bane in next year's The Dark Knight Rises (as if you didn't know already). This film was also receiving good reviews and I'm always looking for a good story.<br /><br />The good news is that I think Tom Hardy will have no trouble convincing anyone he can go toe to toe with Batman next year, as his character in this movie was just destroying guys convincingly.<br /><br />Perhaps the not so good news is that, after having several days to digest the movie, I'm not sure it was all that good. There are similarities between Warrior and The Fighter, with the sports aspect and focus on the family dynamic, specifically between two brothers. Most of the time it's fairly easy to make and enjoy a sports movie because they tend to include an underdog and a relatively one dimensional demonized antagonist. What makes Warrior a bit different is that it's a story that belongs to both of the brothers, and they both have very good reasons for entering a $5 million mixed martial arts tournament. Some of those who came to see the movie with me even turned to me during the film and remarked how they weren't sure which one they should root for.<br /><br />I can see how this kind of ambiguity can be appealing and even enough to convince folks that this is perhaps twice as good as the standard sports movies because you can root for either one of these brothers, but the more I think about it, the more it feels like they wanted to make a movie about one brother and one about the other and in the end each was given half a story and half a movie. This was particularly true of Tom Hardy's character, Tommy, who plays a very rough around the edges ex soldier with a dark past. We're introduced to Tommy first as he confronts his father, Paddy (played by Nick Nolte), after a decade-and-a-half estrangement that began when Tommy and his mother fled from his abusive father. Tommy's older brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton), stayed with Paddy to pursue his high school sweetheart. To Tommy's surprise, Paddy has been sober for years now, as Tommy has obviously taken to drinking to drown out his ghosts, including the memory of his mother, who became ill and died after they fled. Tommy uses virtually every opportunity to throw his father's past nature in his face; it's clear Tommy despises his father, yet returns several days later to ask his father to train him for an upcoming MMA tournament due to Paddy's great success as Tommy's childhood wrestling trainer.<br /><br />With all of this potential for drama, it may be puzzling to note the assessment of Tommy only having half a story. However, the reason I think the movie fell short of exploring the dramatic potential was because Tommy is constantly acting like a douche bag, and all of his redemptive qualities seem to be buried in his past along with his demons. There are adequate opportunities to explore the strenuous bonds between his father and him and between him and Brenden, but the movie has Tommy slamming the door on these chances time and time again. Of course, there is understandable resentment and anger Tommy bears towards both of them, so it makes sense that he doesn't break down and try to begin anew with either them right away. But, this isn't the problem; the problem is that there is a distinct lack of exploration of these issues brought on by the writers keeping him in the same gear throughout the movie. It felt as if there needed to be another character in this movie that Tommy could express himself to so we could get a better look inside his head, because when the redemptive moments do come, they seem almost forced, and when the reconciliation moments come, they certainly seem too quick.<br /><br />Brenden, on the other hand, has his motivations laid out for us. It's revealed he used to fight in MMA matches but has since given that life up at the behest of Tess, his then-sweetheart and now-wife. Brenden is now a high school physics teacher and raises two kids with Tess, and their family maintains a wide emotional and physical distance from Paddy. Tess and Brenden have three jobs between them, but still struggle to make ends meet. A major blow comes to the family when Brenden is informed that he doesn't have the money needed to keep their house, which will be repossessed in a matter of weeks. Desperate, Brenden enters a minor cash prize MMA fight and wins, but the telltale signs of fighting put a strain on his marriage and cause him to get suspended without pay at the high school. Low on options, he convinces his wife to let him start fighting again in order to keep the house, and he enlists the help of his friend and old trainer, who also happens to be training another participant for the major MMA tournament in which Tommy will participate. During the obligatory montage of training and minor fights, this other fighter is injured and Brenden convinces his friend to let him take the fighter's place in the tournament.<br /><br />The stage is set and the brothers collide as revealed by the trailers and the cage is where the brothers have most of their interaction. Throughout the tournament, Tommy proceeds to dominate and Brenden maintains an underdog  status. Brenden's motivations are clear throughout, but Tommy remains a mystery to the film's audience and fans of the tournament until bits and pieces of his past come out. The revelations of Tommy's doing what he does and being who he is are painted in about the most undeniably selfless way possible, which is in stark contrast to the belligerent jerk he is to everyone, so it's hard not to feel the filmmakers poking you with a stick and demanding you like him.<br /><br />I have no doubts, though, that some will look at what Tommy's done and been through and find him easily justified and likeable, but this wasn't my only gripe with the film, despite being the major one. It was unavoidable to compare this movie to The Fighter, and this comparison doesn't help Warrior very much. First off, the acting was far superior in The Fighter, from Christian Bale's chameleon-like portrayal to Amy Adam's edge providing a pleasant departure from her wholesome roles. You can say that Tom Hardy effectively pulls off his character's angry and aloof nature, but the character provides so little room for Tommy and Paddy's words and emotions to carry a dynamic with, leaving no real stellar performances. Secondly, there was a distinct lack of pure entertainment moments that are associated with sports films, the ones where the underdog or the trainer pulls off a pitch-perfect one-liner or completes a move that's smart, sneaky, yet still within the boundaries of the rules; this was particularly evident in the dialogue, which wound up largely forgettable.<br /><br />Despite the filmmakers wanting to achieve (by any means necessary) a double helping of heroes to root for, I felt that both characters of Tommy and Brenden were shafted in some aspect, with the writers keeping Tommy in neutral through too much of the film and the director demanding very little from Edgerton's Brenden. Still, Brenden comes out more likeable and relatable. The movie was good enough, but I felt it could have been better had the dialogue distilled the character's emotions and motivations more clearly and punctuated the scenes. It should get some credit from deviating from standard sports movie fare, but not to the point where we overlook its flaws and overrate it.<br /><br />I'd give it a 3-3.5/5 stars, largely because I am a sucker for sports movies.t has since given that life up at the behest of Tess, his then-sweetheart and now-wife.

Even though it deals with criminal activities, no one dies and the villains are pretty silly.<br /><br />As far as grown-ups go, adults might like hearing celebrities lend their voices to the characters, as there are a ton of well-known actors included in the cast. The best thing would have to be scenes showing off the city. When the main macaw, Blu, sees the city from a bird's-eye-view for the first time, he was in awe...you might feel the same way. There aren't more than a handful of parts that show off the city's greatness, but I absolutely loved them, and they make me want to go visit Rio in the future.<br /><br />It is quite predictable, which shouldn't be a problem because it's mainly geared toward kids, but I don't think this movie will stick with the older viewers as much as some other recent animated movies like [[ASIN:B001KVZ6FW Up (Single-Disc Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00275EHJG Toy Story 3]] had. The extras on the DVD contained sketches of one deleted scene, and some videos to go with all the music in the movie. I wish there was some commentary from the producers, a game, or even something else in the extras, but I guess that doesn't make me dislike the movie or anything. Also, the ending was a bit rushed. It seemed like the film was just beginning to explore romances between some characters, and then it fast forwarded the story to finish it off.<br /><br />Overall, I liked it. I think you will enjoy it at least once, and your little ones will enjoy it time and time again.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I planned a Star Wars BluRay Party about a year before they came out and canceled it once I saw the \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\\"    George Lucas raped our childhood. Again. And again.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Loved it...The changes are miniscule...Beautiful transfer    Bonus features more than make up for the very small amount of changes to the films...    Only change worth whining about is the sound effect change on Tatooine but 3 seconds later I didn't care...    I will watch this with my nephews and nieces (who like Episode 1 the best, btw) and don't care that a bunch of 35-40+ year-old \\"men\\" (a term I use loosely) are complaining about \\"changes\\".    Move past it and enjoy the video quality you've never had before...

B000R7HY0K|5.0|It took me some time to get used to Kurt Russell playing a very rare villain but he proved he was more than capable of playing the bad guy in the made-for-tv movie \\"The Deadly Tower\\" as real life Austin, Texas sniper Charles Whitman. I was a bit surprised that the first segment ended rather abruptly and the second segment began just as abruptly. There was a surprising amount of humor and laughs, especially near the end of the film. The location filming added much, especially in such places as \\"Guero's Taco Bar\\" and \\"The Texas Chili Parlor\\" in Austin, Texas. The cars were exciting and the stuntwork top notch. Zoe Bell proved herself a capable actress in the second half of the film. I wish that lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead had been given more to do and more screen time in the film's second segment. Rose McGowan and Vanessa Ferlito were both great in the first segment. I wouldn't mind if they had left it open for a sequel but the film seemed to pretty much close the door on that with the ending.

0757302661|5.0|I am 100% in love with this book and style of birthing. I knew there was a better alternative to birth rather than being thought of and treated as an illness. I will still give birth in Hospitals because I value modern medicine, yet I see the huge benefits in letting your birthing experience be a beautiful one rather than the hardest thing ever. This book shows you all the things your body already knows how to do and empowers every person involved in the birthing process including the birthing companion and baby. You are worth it, so take the time to recognize your full potential rather than letting fear rule your decision process when it comes to birthing. You were made to do this, if you can get pregnant to have the baby... you can deliver the baby. This book helps you do that in the most effective way possible.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I was thinking about buying this a few days ago and I'm glad I waited. Got it as the FAOTD and it's very hard.

0143117009|3.0|Jared Diamond has a credible background, has written many highly esteemed books, and is very informative. I was excited to read his work, even though it appeared to be quite lengthy and I somewhat expected to be introduced with exciting facts and events. His book, Collapse, goes in depth on the reasons that societies fail or succeed. Although Diamond explains that there are many reasons for the failure, he mainly focuses on the environmental aspect.  For myself, this was a bit of a disappointment but I still found his information interesting.    I learned quite a bit from this book, but I was under a time limit.  Because of this, and the large quantity of facts, I started to loose interest.  Not only would I like to read about the soil that caused problems, but also the wars and the relational aspect. Overall, I think he had too many ideas on what to discuss, and this caused an information overload.    Diamond taught me, but he did not push me to feel more interested in the changes of the environment because I was focused on trying to understand his message.
B004V98UKS|4.0|The game is great.  Install issues are the Bionics fault.  The Bionic has a hiccup sometimes when installing or updating apps... it will say that there is not enough room.  Try installing again.  Sometimes you have to power it off and on then they it again.  Occasionally after installing an app you again have to power off and on to get the app to show up on your phone.  Quit whining about the apps, this one is great.
0553381695|5.0|I got hooked on this series by watching the show Game Of Thrones.  I had no idea if I would like the way George RR Martin wrote but I had to give it a go.  The book is fantastic. The only criticism I have is that there are so many characters. After reading the book for a couple days I realized that I didn't have to remember all of them and sometimes they were irrelevant.  If you need to know who someone is, Martin makes sure that you know them. If you're like me, and you want to know who everyone is, there are several lists online that can provide you with details on each and every character in the book. I loved the show for sure, but now I love the books. I can't wait to find out what happens next with my favorite characters!

B002VKE1K2|5.0|Count me among those who consider Paranormal Activity a brilliant scary movie.  I can understand some people not liking the movie, but I don't see how anyone can get off saying there's no suspense or frightening material to be found here - methinks some just stop watching it within the first half hour and draw their opinions from that.  Paranormal Activity is the Blair Witch Project of the early twenty-first century, maintaining a large degree of realism and constructing its scares on what the audience doesn't see.  As H.P. Lovecraft once said, \\"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is Fear of the Unknown.\\"  Once you see the proverbial monster - no matter how frightening it might be - the fear level goes down because you know what you're dealing with.  When you're threatened by the unknown, your imagination runs wild, flooding your system with more and more fear as the situation persists.  Great horror writers know that less is more, and Paranormal Activity demonstrates this concept exceedingly well.<br /><br />The story is actually pretty simple here.  Katie (Katie Featherston) and her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) are experiencing an escalating series of mysterious night-time frights (bangs, whispered voices, etc.).  This type of haunting activity is no stranger to Katie, as she has experienced similar \\"hauntings\\" on and off since the age of eight.  For poor dumb Micah, it's essentially an exciting game that he is all too eager to play.  That is why he goes out and buys a video camera and recording equipment, hoping to catch some of the weird activity on film.  While he may claim to believe his girlfriend in the beginning, he doesn't share or appreciate Katie's fears until events begin to spin out of control.  This makes for an increasing amount of tension in the couple's lives, and that only adds to the atmosphere engendered by the paranormal events themselves.  Micah and Katie do make for a believable couple, especially in their increasingly emotional reactions to one another.  Ever the man, Micah dismisses the idea of ghosts or demons, treats the psychic Katie calls in with disdain, and insists over and over again that it is his house and that he will take care of the problem - despite the obvious fact that he has no idea what to do and that, in fact, everything he tries only makes the problem worse.  Truth be told, Micah can be a real jerk at times.<br /><br />The special effects are very low key yet effective.  I think even the \\"this film wasn't scary\\" crowd would be a tad unnerved if they caught evidence of lights going off and on and doors moving by themselves in their very own homes - let alone saw and heard the things Katie and Micah go on to experience during their increasingly chaotic nights.  Even the more elaborate effects toward the end look real using the home video camera technology this film employs to tell the entire story.  It is astounding, given the film's fifteen thousand dollar budget.  That's right - for less than the price of a new car, newcomer writer/director Oren Peli made a film that grossed well over one hundred million dollars.  Obviously, he had to be doing something right here, and what he was doing was making one of the most surprisingly effective horror films to come along in years.  I've seen Paranormal Activity numerous times already, and I'm more impressed each time I watch it.cially in their increasingly emotional reactions to one another.

B004V98UKS|4.0|I am not a fan of shooter games, mostly because I suck at 'em. So I snapped up this game for the FAOTD. It's not the most challenging of games - though I bet the levels will be harder as I move on - but it's a fun way to pass the time, and my nieces will probably get a kick out of it as well.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is the lack of easy menu access while playing. I had to hit Menu on my Evo Shift several times, and then I got a &quot;game over better luck next time&quot; screen. Uh, only trying to exit, thx. I did get an exit screen after a few more taps, but I'd like to see an easier way to end a session.
B0011MZOEI|3.0|I watched this recently on cable, and while that fact led me to initially (and erroneously) excuse the otherwise unforgivable truncation of the trademark Yippie-Kai-Yay exclamation, I still enjoyed this fourth entry in the vaunted Die Hard franchise.<br /><br />Bruce Willis as John McClane is back and believable as a senior detective more concerned with his college-aged daughter's boyfriend trouble. But what makes this movie in my opinion is Justin Long (from \\"[[ASIN:B00005JNS4 Ed]],\\" and the nerd from those Apple ads) completing the unlikely buddy duo. Timothy Olyphant is a little weak as the big boss, but Maggie Q picks up the slack and is BADA$$.<br /><br />So why only 3 stars? Well, as hinted at above, the language in this one is a little too clean. While I initially attributed this to a broadcast edit, the truth is even worse. All of the previous Die Hard films were rated R. In what I must assume was a misplaced effort to broaden the film's reach--as if people follow the guidelines, anyway!--this last entry was rated PG-13. The filmmakers reduced profanity, in some cases even muting dialogue post-production. As a result, McClane's climactic \\"Yippie-Kai-Yay, [f]other-[m]ucker!\\" packs less punch than the fat old guy from those Apple commercials.<br /><br />So DH4 loses a star there, and another for the truly unbelievable CGI toward the end of the film. (Especially the highway scene with the dueling semi and the F-35B. C'mon!) Let good actors act. Don't turn it into a cartoon! That scene almost killed the entire movie for me. You can get the [[ASIN:B000VNMMR0 Unrated]] version, which will remedy the first issue, but sadly you cannot excise the CGI stupidity.
0446582778|3.0|Have you ever been waiting to read a certain book because it REALLY LOOKS GOOD, and not only that, but you, the reader, are convinced that THIS BOOK is really going to be good, only to have it be extremely annoying? Man, this was how \\"Angels Flight\\" was to me. Hey, I've been enjoying the Harry Bosch stories, and was eager to read this so I could read \\"Blood Work,\\" and then move on to \\"A Darkness More than Night,\\" and I was really hoping that Connelly was going to pack some real punch in this one. I was disappointed overall. Connelly can do better, and I expect better!<br /><br />Elias Howard is a hard-core, hard-hitting attorney, huge in the black community, and a thorn in the LAPD's side. Well, while in an area known as Angels Flight, Elias, \\"The Thorn in the Side,\\" is conveniently removed, and he's removed permanently! And although Harry Bosch isn't on call this particular weekend, Irving has other plans and says otherwise. And it is up to Harry and his team to make sure that all hell doesn't break loose!<br /><br />Add to the equation that Harry's marriage just might be on the rocks with Eleanor, and you figure you have the latest and greatest bestseller. Right?<br /><br />Well, ok. It says THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER on the front cover. Right? But I don't have to feel as obligated as the New York Times. I thought that Connelly has done a lot better in his writing, and this wasn't it! It was choppy, it didn't have that flow that Michael Connelly usually has in his natural way. And in the end, I suppose if you wanted a Hollywood version, then Connelly takes the easy way out and gives his readers just that. So now I can read the two books that feature Terry McCaleb, and I'll gladly forget about this one. I may have graciously given Michael Connelly 3 stars, and trust me, I'm being nice for doing such a thing, but I'll be glad to forget about the adventures in \\"Angels Flight!\\" Good riddance! Hope the next ride is worth it, like Connelly has been before this.
B004V98UKS|2.0|A classic game idea thats been around for years. However, not developed well for touchscreen phones. Would work better with bottons. The way they developed this game you would think there were no touchscreens around.  CONTROLS ARE JUST BUTTONS ON THE SCREEN!!!
0439023521|5.0|a friend of mine made me read this.  she always gives in to my book and movie suggestions so i thought, just read the book its on sale.  i only ever put it down when i had to.  i was totally submerged in the story and engrossed by the characters.  to start out the story going \\"okay this is sweet and woodsy\\" with gale and katniss in the woods hunting and talking.  i told my friend how i felt and she said \\"keep reading\\".  then came peeta.  then came cinna and rue, even thresh had a his moment where he stole my heart.  My opinion of the story changed greatly.  hunger games is about how far you would go for survival, how do you weigh out survival with holding onto what makes you human, the inhuman lengths people will go to for entertainment when it doesnt affect them and it made me think alot about dog, cock and bull fighting because thats pretty much what this is.   twelve districts, some poor some not so poor, by law ever child starting at age 12s name in put in a drawing called the reaping where 2 kids from each district are forced to go into an arena, unknown to what surroundings they may encounter, and fight to the death. 24 kids enter and one comes out.  If they dont kill in what capitol (like their government)likes time wise they send in game makers to speed up the process going into full on attack.  the reward is that you, your district and family will gain financially if you win.  you have no choice.  when katnisss baby sisters name is pulled she takes her place in the arena along with another teenager from her village that showed her kindness as a child at his expense even though they were strangers.  from day one she doesnt want to kill him.  through the story you see the kids in the arena become, some faster than others, \\"feral\\" savage and violent.  There are times with some that their humanity shows through and some lose it right off the bat because they are what they call \\"careers\\" basically their families have trained them for their \\"special day\\".  thereis alot of death in this book and some of it is downright heartbreaking.  its also a great adventure book about a couple of kids struggle to survive. that and a boy thrown into a to the death arena with the girl hes loved since he was 5.    this is an amazing book that both touched me and totally sucked me in. that and made me think.
B000PMFS2I|2.0|Nomi Malone got her dress at Versace, yet she pronounces it \\"Ver-sayce.\\"  The sleazy bigwigs snicker at her as they patronize her mispronunciation, and it left me with the distinct impression that snickering was the theme of this film: that is, I or anyone else with any sense would snicker at this sleazier version of 1967's Valley of the Dolls.  At least that movie was fun and semi-serious.  This movie was a laugh-riot a minute, so it's impossible to give it one star.<br /><br />Really, sometimes I love bad camp complete with bad acting, but I would have to say that this film breaks new ground.  Elizabeth Berkley looks totally hot in this movie.  Funny, because I never thought she looked that great on Saved by the Bell.  Here she looks like a taller brown-eyed version of a young Kylie Minogue, only her hair is really overly processed and frizzy.  I must admit that I love to watch this when it aires on TV--and lately it's been on like it's going out of style, as if it was ever in--but I would never buy it for even a penny.  The acting and the script are so bad that it's addictive in the way you hate \\"Copacabana\\" but can't help getting it stuck in your noggin all day.<br /><br />Because I haven't seen the very dirty version and don't care to, I find Kyle MacLachlin absolutely horrible in this movie and think he should sue whoever did his hair.  There is more nudity, pouting, bad dancing, and glitter in this fiasco than there are alien abductions in the Bermuda Triangle...DUDE.  The best thing about this flick is Gina Gershon, and even she is embarrassed by her role in this thing.<br /><br />Hey, this may completely be up your alley, but it's not up mine.  Then again, how can I lambast a movie this bad when admittedly loving Pauly Shore's Encino Man?  Hell, I say I don't like this piece of awful offal, and yet every time I happen to be home when it's on it stays on.  Maybe it's because I enjoy the unintentional comic aspect, and still can't figure out why ANYBODY would want to be a pouty trailor trash diva's best friend.  It's on again this afternoon, and my greatest fears will likely be realized via remote.  In the meantime, that damned Barry Manilow song is paraphrasing itself in my head...\\"Her name was Nomi.

B005974CNA|5.0|Dramatic Turn is a fantastic album and a great blend of progressive and metal. The keyboards bring such a balance to John's chops, it's fantastic. I miss Porntoy, I'm sure he'd have thrown in some whacky little fills in certain places. The fact remains, this album moves on. Who knows, maybe the rest of the band stepped up their game knowing they had to prove themselves sans Portnoy. This album really sets a new standard for musicianship and musical adventure. That's what it's all about in this genre.

B000UAFDP2|4.0|There are countless complaints that this film does not work on many Sony BD players.  After alot of searching on the net, here is what I've found:<br /><br />this movie has an authoring problem with the BD-Live function on the disc. It tries to access BD-Live, but there is a glitch in that the player mistakes the amount of memory of the player, and gets stuck in a loop. The disc status bar appears, fills up, and the screen goes black, and nothing happens.<br /><br />The workaround: Connect a blank 1+GB flash memory stick in the unit's REAR USB port. Press play. The movie will work.  I had this problem, I tried this solution.  It works.<br /><br />I do find it kindof aggravating that Sony hasn't done a better job (or ANY job) addressing this issue. This is probably due to the lack of popularity of the title. Starship Troopers remains something of a niche cult title, so maybe they didn't think it was important that many people have returned it. It's sad how big companies can have departments in the same field, working on the same things, but not communicating with one another..<br /><br />As for the disc:<br /><br />This is a terrific looking hi-def transfer, though there is some detail hotness that appears during the first Planet P ambush sequence when Rico is in the radio shack, and stays through the rest of the film.  It's not a deal-breaker, but it's something I think should be addressed in the future. Otherwise, this is a special effects bonanza that only gets better in hi-def.<br /><br />With the exception of the darker interior scenes, this is some of the best CGI creature work ever committed to film. The 'bugs' have a heaviness and depth to them that came from alot of experimenting with the tech that was available in the late 90s. This film created alot of the techniques that are used now. It is something of a watershed in that.<br /><br />Otherwise, what to say about this film?  Starship Troopers is a glossy, tongue-in-cheek love triangle teen soap opera set in a future ultra-fascist military state during a war with an aggressive and repellent alien insect species. The action is over the top, extremely violent, yet it's so full of itself and it's own bombast, it's hard not to like. There is no deep message, no award winning acting.  It is a propaganda movie of the highest cynicism, portraying war as all, and silently saying 'yeah, you love it, don't you?'  It's not hard to see why this movie failed so miserably at the box office, yet lives on as a cult film. It is, if nothing else, pure entertainment, and has a few moments that are easily some of the most visually iconic of sci-fi movies of the past 20 years.in a future ultra-fascist military state during a war with an aggressive and repellent alien insect species.

B005IFWXWU|1.0|Lots of folk jumping on the band-wagon yet again to support a Brit playing American roots music, but not me. Why? Because Hugh is marginally talented musician with excellent acting skills and that's where he should focus his career. There are dozens of extremely talent folks out there who play this music a whole lot better than Laurie, who deserve the recognition that's being wasted on an actor with the clout and bucks to get this project financed. I saw Hugh play live and while he was backed by a very good band his performance was weak and uninspired. Come on Hugh, give some truly deserving undiscovered talent a break, and stick with what you do best- ACT!!!
B002NXSRVG|3.0|This is a good action movie, but it's not GI JOE. I don't know why they even bothered to call it GI JOE if they weren't going to stick closely enough to the original source material. Sure you can change things up a bit, but you don't need to go this far. The only time I got the chills at the sight of something that even vaguely represented GI JOE was when Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow were on screen, but that didn't make up for it. The other thing about this film is that it's for the kids. Gritty and real this is not. Some might say it's a bit harsh but I think it's only a hop skip and jump away from Power rangers territory. Even the Fantastic Four seems more serious, and more convincing, at times (much better acting played a big part in this) and even they stayed closer to the source material (Yes, even the one with Silver Surfer). So if you're looking for a good action movie this is good, but we've yet to see something that brings GI JOE to the screen. To be fair, the biggest departure is the visual aspect, but that's so important in capturing the feel. If no one looks like the characters you were expecting, then it feels like you're watching something completely unrelated. I was dying to see the Vipers as they really looked and many other characters too. It's possible to do it without it being a kiddie flick - if they can make 3 foot tall people with hairy feet who go around fighting goblins convincing then there's no excuse why GI JOE couldn't stay much closer. I give it 2 stars for a GI JOE film and maybe 4 for an action film - so evens out to about 3. Don't expect GI JOE, or anything adult, and you won't be dissapointed.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|Movie - 4.5  Much like the first Iron Man during its theatrical run, I had very little, if any, knowledge of this franchise going in. My expectations were set somewhat high by the success and entertainment value of said Iron Man films, but having only seen Chris Hemsworth once ever in any kind of movie and only knowing (not actually experiencing) any of Kenneth Branagh's directorial works I would say I expected to at least be entertained by the special effects and action sequences, if not any more of the small pepperings of Avengers references being thrown in for the eventual mishmash to come in just a year's time. First, I'd like to address the film's setting. On a personal level, I've enjoyed all kinds of genres throughout the years: sci-fi, fantasy, the supernatural, and all other kinds of \\"unexplainability.\\" With that said, Thor pulls off the fantasy element in a surprisingly epic fashion. From the very get-go of the battle against the Frost Giants to the ornately decorated kingdom of Asgard and the lavish costuming of its warriors, I was captivated within minutes. Which isn't to say that the film is all looks. Very much so like the aforementioned first Iron Man, the plot has a strong focus on the ideas of power, humility, and responsibility (something a lot of superhero stories do, but it seems to be a popular style of storytelling, no?). Right before his crowning as new king of Asgard, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), comes to a point of such vanity and hubris, that his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), strips him of his power and banishes him to earth. And as you can guess, Thor will eventually learn his lesson of humility amongst humans, regain his power, and stop a usurping of his father's throne back in the homeland. Linear plot aside, it's not so much the story itself that manages to impress me, but the way and fashion in which it's told. Coming from quite the Shakespearean background, I would suffice it to say that Kenneth Branagh brings a refreshing kind of Thespian quality to the film's overall atmosphere which, for me, does wonders in terms of the acting, script, and character chemistry. Additionally, Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgård, Kat Dennings, Jaimie Alexander, and Idris Elba give some good performances for what little screen time they have as well. And while the film clocks in at just under 2 hours, it probably could've used an extra 15-30 minutes for some better character development, but oh well.  Video - 5.0  - Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC  - Video resolution: 1080p  - Aspect ratio: 2.35:1  - Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1  The film was shot on 35mm but digitally processed, so it should go without saying that the transfer is flawless. A lot of the backgrounds on Asgard and Jotunheim are obviously CG'd, but as a result look absolutely stunning in HD. During it's theatrical run, I only got to see this in theaters on some dinky film projectors (once for the midnight premiere in an older Cinemark that didn't even have stadium seating, then a second time in an AMC with slightly newer projectors but still not near the quality of their digital ones). At any rate, after having the opportunity to sit down and see this in the comfort of my own home and in glorious Blu-ray, I have to say the cinematography is pure perfection. The shots in Jotunheim are particularly dark and as cold as the planet itself, but nary a bit of detail is lost. Black levels are especially well-accentuated and reveal a great amount of depth and delineation from Laufey's jagged and shadowed face down to the little cracks in the ice and even the line texturing of Thor's cape despite all that snow blowing around. When we get to Asgard the film's color scheme is most pronounced with lavish golds, silvers, and bronzes giving off a very shiny look. The lighting tends to feel slightly less natural in order to balance out the contrast for all the computer effects, but nonetheless blend together seamlessly for a very grandiose and ethereal stage design. In fact,a lot of the closeup shots are notably sharp; just look at the hair on the beards of Thor and Odin or the line detail in all the armor. Meanwhile, the shots on earth will probably look the best out of the lot. Aside from whatever visual effects they added in post-production during the action sequences or whatever, everything else in the little New Mexico town is as non-CG as can be and it results in a very fine and crisp picture. Natalie Portman never looked prettier. And if you're a girl, you'll be happy to know Chris Hemsworth's buffness really stands out, too.. Anyway, my favorite shots of the movie are the skirmish on Jotunheim for its incredible blacks and sustainable line detail, then the fight on the Bifröst around the end of the film for its colors and excellent CG integration.  Audio - 5.0  Languages  - English: DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1  - French: Dolby Digital 5.1  - Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1  - Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1  Subtitles  - English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese  To this point my 3 loudest BDs have been Hellboy II, Casino Royale, and Inception (which even blew out my sub-woofer at one point). Needless to say, I think I've found my new number one by a long shot. I keep reading that people say Thor's sound design / mixing is a little too aggressive for its own good, but I say bollocks. Not only does it make Thor the sonically captivating summer blockbuster it should be but I personally think it fits the theme \\"god of thunder\\" to a tee. LFEs are easily the best part of the track with booming and thunderous (and literally) ground-shaking rumbles that range from subtle to \\"I can feel my butt vibrating.\\" From the very get-go of Odin fighting the Frost Giants on earth it's a pretty clear cut example of what to expect for the rest of the movie. And when Thor actually gets to Jotunheim to battle the Frost Giants himself its even crazier and louder than that. Discrete effects and separation are there, mind you, but holy crap does the placement and directionality really excel when fights break out. Dialogue stays clear and audible in the center with music and effects being dispersed evenly through the fronts. But my biggest delight is in the fact of how well-placed the rears and backs are in terms of their directionality. Normally, a 5.1 design would have you just at the edge of the \\"sound bubble.\\" However, with 7.1 you're completely enveloped by sound every which way be it from the front, side, or behind. And because of that (in addition to the awesome design / mixing efforts of Michael Babcock and Anna Behlmer), we get a terrific soundscape that has truly brought the comic and legend to life. My favorite scenes would be the battle on Jotunheim (yet again) for its resounding bass, precision directionality, and overall vibrato, and of course, the battle on or any moment that the Bifröst itself is activated. Or, for something a little less boisterous I'd recommend the scene where Thor is breaking into the S.H.E.I.L.D. compound to retrieve Mjölner. There are some instances of thunder crackling in the night sky followed by some discretely-placed rainfall that sound pretty cool.  Extras - 4.0  I'm actually a little disappointed with the amount of behind-the-scenes footage, here. The movie felt very epic in scope and I was hoping it would've been as extensive as Iron Man with at least a second disc of extras approximating around 2 hours. Unfortunately, it only rounds out to something like 47 minutes without the Marvel One-Shot, Deleted Scenes, or Trailers.  - Audio Commentary (Director Kenneth Branagh)  This is only the first time I've heard him do one, but wow Branagh is really informative and knows his stuff. He covers just about everything else you wish they would've covered in the featurettes and does so in a very professional, yet open fashion. It's a quick-paced and brisk coverage of all things related to the film that tells you about: when he was approached to direct the film and what transpired,how he wanted to tell the story when making it, some of the thematic and symbolic ideas he wanted to display with the visuals, his experience with the actors, the prospect of filming in 3D and post-converting it, how they shot and came up with ideas for the visual effects, etc. There's hardly any dead space throughout and the man just keeps bombarding you with a plethora of factoids that are all prevalent to either the movie, the Marvel Universe, or to film-making in general. It's definitely worth a listen for fans of the film.  - Marvel One-Shot: The Consultant (HD; 3:57)  Presented in 1080p and Dolby Digital 5.1, this is a hilarious tie-in between some of the events of Iron Man 2 and The Incredible Hulk. We see Agent Coulson talking to Agent Sitwell about how the military is trying to push The Abomination as a candidate for the Avengers. Neither of them agree with the idea of putting him in, so they decide to sabotage negotiations with General Ross by sending \\"The Consultant\\" as a patsy to screw things up intentionally. It's short, but very much in the spirit of both Tony Stark and the comedic elements of the Marvel Movie Universe franchise thus far. Definitely give this a watch.  Featurettes (HD; 46:59 altogether)  - From Asgard to Earth (HD; 19:42)  This covers a big chunk of the film's production. It talks about things like the atmosphere of Thor, how they wanted to portray Asgard in terms of scope and design, and all the subtleties they went into for the costuming, make up, coloring, and camera work. In addition, this segment also covers some of the research done on the comic books to translate and adapt said material to look as real as possible, but also infuse the designs with enough imagination for that fantasy element. They then discuss Puente Antiguo (the little New Mexican town) and how it was completely built from scratch, as well as the design parallels to Asgard and how a lot of structures represented some of the more symbolic elements of the story'sthemes.  - Our Fearless Leader (HD; 3:18)  Talks about Kenneth Branagh's directing style from various members of the cast.  - Assembling the Troupe (HD; 4:44)  Discusses the casting of Thor, Jane, and Odin.  - Hammer Time (HD; 6:14)  Shows the various designs they went through to get the look of Mjolnir (about 200 different sketches), and how they constructed 3 different kinds of hammers for Hemsworth to using during filming.  - Creating Laufey (HD; 5:33)  The make up work and a little bit of discussion about the king of the Frost Giants.  - Music of the Gods (HD; 2:05)  A disappointingly short feature about Patrick Doyle's awesome score. I really wish this one were a lot longer.  - A Conversation (HD; 2:23)  Another short discussion with co-creator Stan Lee, co-producer Craig Kyle, comic book writer J. Michael Straczynski.  - Road to the Avengers (HD; 2:57)  A mishmash of footage from the other films in the MMU leading up The Avengers. It's nothing more than a tease, as there is no actual Avengers footage to be found.  - Deleted Scenes (HD; 24:34)  There is optional commentary from director Kenneth Branagh, and I think a few of those clips actually could've worked for the movie overall.  - Trailers (HD; 7:25)  Teaser, Theatrical, and Avengers Animated.  Overall - 4.5  Marvel Studios continues to churn out these very well-made pre-Avengers films. Up to this point, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, and Thor have all managed to be highly entertaining movies and still tell a very good character story to boot (well, minus Hulk, but it's a great action flick). Out of the entire lineup, though, Thor is definitely the most unique with its fantasy element and outer spacey galactic potential if the Studio ever decides to go otherworldly with another franchise (Silver Surfer by Alex Proyas would be a neat idea). Oh, and there's still Captain America to be explored (my favorite of them all, actually), but that will have to wait another month. With reference A/V quality and a decent amount of extras that are only salvaged by that kick-ass- commentary by Branagh, Thor comes highly recommended, especially for fans of the Marvel Movie Universe.
B005974CNA|5.0|Obviously the question everyone has had regarding DT was: could Dream Theater still make it without Mike Portnoy?  I have no idea whether the road trips are as interesting for the band, whether videos will be as entertaining, whether they will be able to maintain the group over the long term; but this album makes an emphatic statement that with or without Portnoy, the music is just fine.  My feeling is that Jordan Rudess comes more to the fore here than in the past, that indeed everyone has had to step up, but every single person in the band is such a solid musician that we just don't need to worry about the music.    This album is occasionally more lyrical than the band has been in past work, and I'd swear I am detecting cross influences coming in: was that the sound of some Opeth guitar riffs there, or has Mikael Akerfeldt just been trying to sound like DT all this time?  It is all to the good though.  I liked this work from the first notes, and I like it more now that I have heard it a few times.  If you enjoy listening to well-constructed music from fine musicians, buy this.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Great game, glad I snatched it up for free but definitely worth .99 cents.  Reminds me of the game Goo, which is great too.  Runs great on my bionic.
B000JIHP88|4.0|My daughter who is four months old loves to look up at this. The music is great not to loud and peaceful. I'm very pleased with this mobile.
B005HG4C4C|4.0|I am by no means a fanboy; I was severely underwhelmed by Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds and Silver Linings. But this is a very worthy effort that stands alongside their best work. The main difference is that these tracks seem purposefully composed, rather than sounding like the product of a random cut-and-paste job, which was definitely my feeling for much of the material on the last two albums. I suspected the guys were having artistic differences (watch the behind-the-scenes video that came out with Systematic Chaos, and you can see the tension between Portnoy and the other members as he asserts his will over everything). But I didn't really realize how much those competing viewpoints had damaged the music until I listened to this new disc five or six times. It's simply a level or two above anything they've done in the last five years. A cohesive effort, with a lot of killer musicianship, a lot of soaring, anthemic moments, and plain old joy for music shining through. And no cookie monster vocals!    Production wise, yes, I'd like a smidgen more volume on the drums, but overall the mix is wonderfully balanced and dynamic (free of clipping, sounds great loud). And the lyrics fall on the more abstract side of the spectrum, which works better than the trying-too-hard monster stories on Systematic Chaos or another self-absorbed Portnoy effort (Best of Times, the dreadful \\"AA\\" series).     Can't wait to see what happens with the new Mike as part of the writing process next time out. And it's been a while since one of DT's releases made me excited for the next one!
B0036EH3UC|1.0|As a sci-fi buff and huge fan familiar with a variety of shows in this genre, I genuinely fail to understand all the positive reviews about this show. This was a tedious series, with tedious, insipid plot lines populated by equally tedious, two-dimensional characters who, worst of all, are unlikable too. Throughout the run of the show there was not one person I could sympathize with. Let's forget for a second that they completely ruined the dynamic of the original show by turning \\"Starbuck\\" into a woman who acts like a man who is wondering how a woman would act like if she were acting like a man, and that \\"Boomer\\" turns out to be a (very annoying and lame) Cylone, but contents wise the show also left much to be desired. I can certainly live with the gender change had it be done in a believable way creating actually likable characters. But that is juts one of the issues with this show.   The premise is pretty interesting and I had some serious hopes for the series but after the whole Nip/Tuck-Melrose Place interludes we got of the hot, six-foot tall sex kitten seducing that man (Dr. Baltar) against the wall it was pretty clear that this show was never going to be anything but a lame space version of some day-time soap, relying more on flashy, stylized scenes and equally flashy deliveries than actual contents and character development and with it quality. I believe that if they had cast Star Trek: Voyager today, they wouldnt have picked a middle aged Kate Mulgrew for the part but some 25 year old hot chick with an impressive rack. It is pretty obvious that the role for the \\"Model SLASH Actor\\" bimbette in this show was written in there for ratings; something which took away from the quality of the show and its contents, by appealing to cheap marketing tools and male hormones to tell a story basically. I am all for attractive leads but not as a substitute for contents.   Here are the other serious shortcomings of the show:  + The enemy is vague and uninspiring and we never find out their reasons for this bloody vendetta of actually going after and hunting down BSG to eradicate human kind. We also never find out what happened in those forty years they were away, why they sought revenge and came back and what else their motivations are - or even _who_ they are. Four seasons passed and all that was untouched and remained unresolved. Instead, the show spent a lot of time involving the characters in petty internal conflicts where they bicker back and forth and connive against each other in a typical soap-opera fashion. If there hadnt been spaceships flying around and if the characters werent wearing uniforms and reciting sci-fi jargon, you'd think you are in The OC.   + Another annoying element was the whole NYP-Blue/unsteady cam thing that was employed a lot when they were showing the bridge crew and other things. It just gave the show the feel of some cop show a la SVU or The Closer.   + As mentioned above, the characters themselves are uninspiring and annoying, which makes it really hard to root for them or empathize with their cause even. At some point i was seriously hoping someone would punch Starbuck in her fat face and throw that lame president woman, played horribly by Mary McDonnell - who is apparently only capable of the same three expressions - out of an airlock.   + One important element of good movie making is creating characters that are not only believable and who inhabit their roles but also characters people can identify with; BSG failed on all accounts as it created fundamentally unrewarding, dull characters. Certain themes in the human consciousness are universal regardless of actual settings - be it sci-fi or film noir or a Western. Even villains the audience can \\"like\\" if done right. The stories here were just all over the place, silly and boring, not very intelligent and just too soap-opera-ish, caught up with the minutiae of the characters' petty issues and side tracked by insincere melodrama instead of focusingon the story and the adventure.  + As someone mentioned earlier, the cast uniformly looks like they're acting and you can almost tell when they called \\"action\\" a minute ago. It is also frustrating to see that these last human beings who are chased by a genocidal race waste so much time and energy fighting and sabotaging each other over completely trivial crap too. You get to the point where you feel like there really is not hope for humanity and that maybe they all seriously deserve to die, given the sheer worthless people they are - in and out. Not a single character is convincing and believable as a real person - be it through their actions or words or personality - and as stated above, the cliches are being employed in the plenty as well, with each character fulfilling one role, namely that of leader, hero, warrior, tough girl, disturbed genius, seductive siren, angry drunk.  It is almost as if the network took the producers and writers aside and gave them a laundry list of plot devices and factors that had to be included in the show before it got the green light. Just pil'em up boys.   What gets me is that this could have been sooooo good. These people are going through half the galaxy on a space ship to find Earth or a home. Imagine all the possibilities that could have been created such as encountering strange spacial phenomena and landing on different planets and making all sorts of contacts with alien species. An adventure. Instead it just morphed into some overtly politicized soap opera taking place in space. They dumbed the whole premise down to fit the attention span of the MTV generation (and I am in mid 20s, so it's not like I am some nostalgic old person who cant get over the past).   + Also, since the Cylones already had control over everything and didnt need to infiltrate anyone, the whole story line about Dr. Baltar and his imaginary Cylon bombshell, said hot chick from above, who was just a computer chip implanted in his brain, for all these yearsseemed superfluous. How did that contribute to the story?  Why was it relevant other than every now and then inserting some stylized sex into the plot to distract from the otherwise bland, boring plot. Again, obviously just kept in to make up visually for what the show lacks in substance and contents.   + Speaking of which, aside from being all over the place, lousy acting and two dimensional characters, there was also nothing intelligent ever tackled in the story lines. No attempts were made at science, philosophy, the human condition, regret, redemption and just answering the tough questions - nothing. There was a huge potential there frankly requiring a stellar and creative writing team, not these comatose drone of writers who are just working on orders for the networks and allow marketing strategies and the bottom line dictate the art.   + And let's not even talk about the ending where they land on this new Earth and decide to destroy their technology and basically be what? Nomads living in caves? Spread out, no technology, no medicine, no supplies, no tools. \\"Oh look there is a mountain, I'd like to trek there.\\" And then what? What happens when you break your leg or get malaria maybe or have a kidney stone? It was just silly. It didnt make sense how these people were imagining to work things out - reverting back to cave-man standards? Without anything? Everyone who camped in the woods knows there is nothing easy about it. And did any of the people actually mate with one of the native apes? Seriously? I like the premise of the cylone/human hybrid being the Mitochondrial Eve but the whole story about how they decided to just settle on the planet without anything seems unrealistic and bizarre. Truth is that these are in fact NOT primitive caveman so 1) you cannot expect them to live and intermingle with the natives and 2) I doubt they'd have a great life there after 2 or 3 years of hard work where their lives consist of looking for berries to fill their stomachs,and shelter while hoping they can dodge the next illness. There was nothing romantic and liberating about it really and thus just not very convincing at all. In a way I feel sorry for them having to live out their lives on an essentially empty planet.   In summary, under the guise of the label \\"sci-fi\\", this show was nothing but an unintelligent, boring and trite tech savvy version of something like Melrose Place or 90210. They just piled up all the cliches they could, thinking this would be a sure win-win situation ratings wise. I would say skip this boring, dumb piece of garbage that is trying to pass as a sci-fi show, unless you enjoy day-time soaps or Lifetime movies while at the same time also being tolerant toward some sci-fi elements interspersed in between for show.

If you have ever had, known or worked with teenagers, this book will both break your heart, help you to believe in hope, and encourage you to open your mind. When male authors publish a serious work, they are greeted with acclaim. Sometimes, sometimes, when a female author writes a serious work with the protagonist being a female, the book is dimsissed as a \\"chick book.\\" This is a big mistake with this novel. The many men I know who have read this book are, quite simply, stunned. We had the blessing of hearing Vanessa Diffenbaugh speak to our students and teachers, and more significantly, decide to just take questions from the audience of mostly teenagers. Two sessions, two hundred teenagers at each, and each of us held our breath, and laughed, and so appreciated this amazingly humble and caring person. She is the real deal.

0375414053|3.0|I was a working mom for awhile after my daughter was born, am a SAHM now, and when I finish classes at school, I will be going back to work now that my child is preschool age. BOTH are difficult, and there have been times as a working mom that I wanted to be at home, and times as a SAHM that I wanted to go to work. This book is funny and well written, but completely one sided in that it insinuates that SAHM are just mindless, flighty women who do nothing but get mani-pedis and shop. To put that idea across in this day and age when we're supposed to respect the choices of others is sexist and ugly...the women who do that to SAHM's are no different than the folks of former eras who judged working women for their choices. I haven't \\"ruined\\" my education by staying at home, nor do I think it's always the best decision for every woman or that I'm doing the \\"most important job in the world\\" as some self righteously suggest. My husband and I made the best decision for us at the time, for financial and personal reasons, and there have been times that I've been busier as a SAHM than I ever was while working, and vice versa. To use a recurring theme in the book, why is a man who stays at home regarded as a wonderful, devoted father, but a woman who stays at home is mindless and silly and \\"ruining\\" her education? And seriously, if all the SAHM friends you have judge you or ignore you, then you have a problem with choosing decent friends. I am part of a huge group of women who are SAHM, Working moms, work at home moms, and childfree, and there's never anything like what others have described here. Choose your friends more wisely. Again, as for the book, I almost really enjoyed it, except for the parts where I felt my choices were being mocked. Other than that, it was certainly funny and refreshing.
0756655307|5.0|My 12-year old old ordered this Marvel Encyclopedia.  It is a wonderful, hard-cover book, with LOTS Of great drawings along with information, history, origins, and facts about each of the comic characters.

Great book if you like the Marvel movies and like the Marvel comics!

B005AUWXZ0|1.0|Pixar has once again created a marvelous looking film.  Unfortunately, the animation and special effects is about all this movie has going for it.  Aside from the fact that story drags and is nowhere near as interesting as Cars 1, Pixar/Disney thought it would be appropriate to make political propaganda a centerpiece of this film.  It even goes as far as taking numerous jabs at \\"Big Oil\\" as referred to in the film - kind of ironic for a sequel spawned by an original movie starring a gas-powered racecar.  I thought Pixar had a principal never to include politics in their films?  They clearly violated that with this film.  Not to mention that Mater - the annoying broken down tow-truck - is clearly the star of this movie, instead of Lightning McQueen - adding to the monotony.    So, a combination of a boring plot plus heavy-handed political drivel makes Cars 2 a loser.  Stick with the original, which has a far superior story and is far less preachy!

B0046IGOIO|5.0|Not the best sound of the Doors Bright Midnight releases, but well worth buying. The highlight is a nearly 18 minute \\"Light My Fire\\" with Krieger quoting both \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"My Favorite Things\\" in his solo and Morrison interpolating several other songs after Krieger's solo before the return to the head. I've got a heap of Doors live recordings including Detroit, Pittsburgh, New York and the Aquarius Theater Second Show, and this is the only one of those on which \\"Light My Fire\\" is stretched out like that (though it's not the ultimate \\"Light My Fire\\" if there is such a thing).
0307269760|5.0|I first discovered Alice Munro by reading [[ASIN:0375703632 The Love of a Good Woman : Stories]]. The second volume that I've read was [[ASIN:0375727434 Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage: Stories]]. I've reviewed the later at Amazon, giving it that rarer accolade: 6-stars. The list of authors who only had one really good book in them is long; subsequent works were often pale shadows of the great one. Not so Alice Munro. She continues to craft short stories of undiminished excellence. There simply is not a weak one in this collection. I admire the tightness, the sheer density of her work. Like some Picasso paintings, with an economy of lines that are sufficient to convey the entire image, she presents the reader with an abundance of information with only a few sentences. Throughout her stories, she maintains the reader in a high state of dramatic tension. She bobs and weaves, and it is impossible to predict how she will end it. Ah, much like life itself, and it would be difficult to find a keener observer that Ms. Munro.<br /><br />There are ten stories in this collection; the first nine are all slices, albeit extraordinary, drawn from contemporary Canadian life. In \\"Dimensions,\\" there is Lloyd, a crazy ex-hippie who works as an orderly, and who marries Doree. The title suggests a new dimension that their two kids have entered. And the ending, indeed, one of those real life surprises. \\"Fiction\\" is quintessentially modern, with multiple marriages, different sexual orientations, and a wedding party that brings them together. Is it possible that one of the attendees, a new author, recognizes the woman who was once her music teacher? \\"Wenlock edge\\" is one of her \\"edgier\\" pieces, with two young women, one a veritable baby production machine, and the varying ways they maintain themselves via older men. I heard the screech of chalk on the board in this one several times. \\"Deep-holes\\" concerns the son of a geologist who falls into a deep hole in the rocks. Does it mark him for the rest of his life? He grows estranged from his family, and there is a heart-breaking reunion with his mother later in life - as with much of Munro, it is not what you might expect. The tension is strong also in \\"Free Radicals,\\" as a woman, 62, with terminal cancer, must outwit an unexpected visitor. \\"Face\\" is all about a birth mark, and how that one oddity, like many others, so marks, as it were, the individual's relationships with the rest of humanity. Do they all make fun, particularly the \\"cruel\\" children, or is there some empathy, displayed in strange ways? The central character in \\"Some Women\\" is a man dying of leukemia, back when the treatment options were severely circumscribed. The title refers to the three women who surround him: his wife, his mother-in-law, and a woman invited to the home to give massages. The story centers on the interactions of the women; he coming on stage at the end in decisive action. \\"Child's Play\\" addresses again the cruelty of children, and a horrible secret that is carried to the end of one of principal character's life. Why, oh why can we be so heartless to those less fortunate; who drew the bad hands in life? And \\"Wood\\" concerns a man who works with it, loves it, and harvests it, and the premonitions of his wife.<br /><br />The tenth story breaks the pattern. It is a fictionalized account of the life of Sophia Kovalevsky, a 19th Century Russian mathematician, who broke many barriers and molds herself. She became the first woman to teach mathematics at a university in Europe. That progressive step was taken in Sweden. The story concerns certainly her loves, her \\"white\\" marriage, the life of the upper class in late 19th century Europe, as well as those who hoped to bring it down, notably via the Commune, in Paris, in 1871. Dostoevsky, the mathematician Henri Poincar&eacute;, Charlotte Corday, and others are skillfully woven into this penetrating recreation of her life. For what it's worth, Kovalevsky has even had a crater on the moon named after her.<br /><br />Like so many of her characters, Alice Munro is Canadian. She both transcends and places Canadian literature on the world stage, for she remains THE short story writer without equal. Again, with all hyperventilation aside: 6-stars.moon named after her.       Like so many of her characters, Alice Munro is Canadian.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I thought the book was a great read. A lot of reviewers seem to think they are a little Â«to cool for schoolÂ» with their reviews. I'm not sure what they wanted but this book had everything I was hoping it would have. Highly recommended!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This video is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. It good for both kids and adults.

B003ZD9DUC|1.0|I thought this was going to be a good movie. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 95%. It's the worst highly rated movie I've ever seen. My girlfriend and I kept saying \\"WTF?\\" the entire time we watched it. It made very little sense. The Road Warrior is much, much better.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game is fun, yet challening, with a pretty cool puzzle concept I have not seen before.  I highly recommend giving this app a try.
0553801473|3.0|I'm a big Martin fan and really enjoy his writing style, but it seems that George Martin is determined to drag this series out as far as he can.  Not much happened in this book that's worth mentioning, and not much in the last one either.  Nothing was resolved, it was mostly characters moving from one place to another either by ship or on foot.  This series is starting to look depressingly similar to the Wheel of time series by Robert Jordan, whose last 4 books could have been compressed into one with no harm done to the story. Hopefully we won't have to wait another 10 years for the next book.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|I have the original Droid, the game opens and plays but at times it gets super laggy (even with display set to low). an update to fix this would be greatly appreciated. otherwise, gameplay is very fun and challenging.

While most executives are trianed to 'make' things successful and to 'fight' to win a losing proposition, Andrew made a very tough deicison which was to get out of one line of business and bet the entire company on another. Not many people could do that. He did and the success of Intel and the computer industry was the result.\\"
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This game is a blast. Great original concept--or at least something I haven't come across, yet. The puzzles become progressively more difficult. Great graphics. Fun sound effects. Enjoyable music, though it becomes a bit repetitive after you have been playing awhile. I have to admit I was a little disappointed when I finished the first set of levels and was not rewarded with a cut scene. Would be better if there was more of a story line. Intro and menu feel a bit &quot;Angry Bird-ish,&quot; but I like it.  Bottom line? Fun game. Great concept. Nice implementation. Could use a little more story and more variety in the music.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|this such a wonderful show for all ages! the colorful bird's are spectaular! my kids enjoyed this pictuere so much they bought for there kids too.
1451629184|5.0|I have to be honest as I'm inspired enough to write this review after only reading the very first two chapters.  I will edit the end of this with my final opinions when I have finished the book, but I just had to add this.    First of all, if Jaycee would ever get to read this review, I'd like to tell her what an inspiring, talented, Worthy woman she is.  I want her to know how highly valued she is, & to never underestimate herself.  She is truly a strong woman even if she doesn't feel like it at times & I pray that she will find healing from her long endured wounds.  Jaycee, I wish I could sit down with you & share the love of Jesus Christ, & though it sounds foolish & brainwashed to people who don't really know Him, it makes me sad, for if they only understood, they'd grasp on too! :)      Secondly, I am a woman who was domestically physically etc abused myself for 8 years.  I never experienced the suffering that Jaycee did as a child, & I would Never compare the very different personal circumstances.  I do know what it's been like for me to deal with traumatic abuse, & how hard it is to gain a \\"normal\\" perspective when \\"normal\\" for us is daily beatings, fear, humiliation, depression, loneliness, & despair.  When the world & others, & things happening around you are viewed with those eyes, what is very \\"ok\\" for others who haven't experienced abuse, can totally freak out someone who is viewing things through our eyes, and vice verca.  Such as something as simple as being at home alone at night.  That to someone who never experienced abuse would be easily handled, it wouldn't be something difficult, it would actually be something to enjoy!  A time of peace & privacy to watch that movie or read that book or catch up on things you haven't been able to get too!  For someone who has been abused, being alone at night is a completely different story.  It brings fear, anxiety, panic, extreme tension, nausea, headache, & emotional pain.  Being alone brings back horrible memories, gives the mind time to recall past memories of pain & harm. Even without the remote chance of being harmed, there is an intense fear that the abuser is going to walk through that door & hurt you all over again or in my case, attempt to take your life.  I can't explain it but if you've ever had the kind of fear where you feel like you can barely breathe, you can hear your heart beating, your muscles ache they're so tight, your stomach feels sick, & you feel you are in intense danger you're not sure you can get out of, that's what it feels like.  Breaking that feeling isn't something you can \\"choose\\" to do.  It takes a Long time.  It takes encouragement, extreme understanding, Lots of counseling, learning to revalue yourself, learning that you are safe, being able to break your dependence on others, learning you can believe in yourself, & alot of time etc.      Also viewing the world through an abused persons eyes, things that would generally set off a red flag to others who haven't been abused, will be completely overlooked & missed by the one who has been abused.  For instance, A man can \\"worry\\" about you & have to know your every move, when you get home, when you get to work, when you left the grocery store.  For an Unabused person this would quickly be recognized as control, paranoya (sp), & possibly a dangerous person to be around.  A red flag would be detected & that person would cut off contact with them because they recognize it as unhealthy & possibly dangerous!  An abused person who experiences the same thing is viewing those actions as loving, protective, caring, & feeling that that person is really looking out for the abused person & easily becomes entranced by amount of love that they believe is being shown for they Crave love like we need air to breathe when we've held our breath far too long.  They easily can be manipulated & taken advantage of in different ways & levels over & over again.  That's why it is So Imperatively Important for Anyone who has Ever been abused, no matter how bad or how long, to be sure that a counselor & proved trustworthy family members are kept very close & know every detail of every relationship as long as the abused person (I will not use the word victim) is healing.  Keep this Rule with you at all times:  If there is something about someone that you are afraid to share with others, that is a very bad sign that something is wrong.  That's when you Run to tell you closest trusted confidant & counselor immediately before you accidentally endanger yourself.  Tell them Everything.  Don't kid yourself.  Healing takes Years.  Years.  Years.  when you think you're done...you find out you aren't & it takes more time.  But keep going, when you fall down, get up Every time right away, dust yourself off, tell yourself that you are important that you have High Value!  & there Are good people out there who won't take advantage, & you'll be ok.    I only write all of this for two reasons, one the people who are reading this book are either those who have been abused & those who have not, & may not understand an abused person's world.  I want to encourage those who have been abused, & share just a little with those who may not understand.  I think that so far in this book, Jaycee has done a terrific job in explaining what happened to her, & how her life was from her eyes.  I'm really enjoying it, & I hope you all do too!    PS for the person who complained that she mentioned her cats too much....It does sound \\"odd\\" that someone would speak so much about a furry friend :)  However, with someone who has suffered abuse at the hand of a person, they learn to distrust people very quickly.  People can change how they treat you & act toward you very quickly, & we don't always know when that is going to happen & the more people mistreat, the more we distrust.  When someone is mistreated that long by another person, you can easliy distrust Every person, or Most people.  Now think of your dog.  When youcome home from work, before you open your front door, (unless your dog is sick, mistreated, or getting pretty old), do you Ever have to wonder what your dog's reaction to you walking in the door will be?  Do you ever have to question whether your dog will greet you happily or in intense anger?  No!  We all know, the minute we open the door, our dog is going to come running over all happy & tail wagging & licking your face to see you.  In fact if you pay attention, just thinking about that right before you open that door every day, you will smile unconsciously knowing how you are about to be greeted! (If your dog is ever greeting you in anger, then you may need to consider how you are treating your dog or if you dog is in pain or real sick!)  We don't have that luxery with some people, & definately abusive people.  Animals are scientifically proven to reduce stress, increase length of life, & boost morality.  To an abused person who is faced with that fear & distrust of another human every day, all day, over a long period of time, with this Never ending, never a break, never a moment of feeling safe; an Animal who is a Constant, Reliable, Trustworthy, object of affection who loves All the time, is an incredible, Incredible thing of safety, rescue, & relief.  It is the Only thing that relieves the stress & makes you feel good about yourself, & the only thing you can trust & oddly brings a small feeling of safety even if it's false.  You crave love & need to feel like you can trust another & feel safe with another so much as a human being that when fully deprived of it & immersed in the opposite - abuse, an animal will become a Strong being to bond with.  So that is why she talks about her cats so much.  They are her trusted furry \\"people\\" & take on the role she desperately needed.  That bond doesn't really break when you heal, you just become more whole.  I still have a strong attachment to my cats, & miss the two who have died who gave me comfort while my husband was abusing me.  But I also had God.  & He is the one who really deserves the credit, for I know that if He wasn't watching out for me, & for Jaycee, either one of us may not have made it out alive.    Thank you to anyone who read this long post lol  I hope it helped!
1423113497|4.0|Our grandson, age 12, is rereading the first of the three volumes because he enjoyed it so much. I've read two of the three and enjoyed them. They are a good way to familiarize young readers with the concepts of mythological gods, along with good adventures. My grandson was surprisingly good at remembering the names and characters along with the story.
B002QXI2M2|5.0|This was recorded a year before she suddenly passed away and to see her take a bow at the end is a wonderful thing. I saw a performance by her company in the early eighties and having to wait another thirty years to see another performance  has not diminished my admiration of her. My concern is of the film work itself. It is a dance opera but the director of the video is focused too much on recording the dancers and not the singers, thus sometimes it is difficult to view everything that is going on the stage. Watching it made me realise that for all her accolades as a contemporary creator of dance drama she was very rooted in conventional dance, not that I am complaining,  the work is stunning. It is haunting and very emotionally engaginq.
1594484805|5.0|Amazing book. I thought of the leaders of Devis when I read this book as they practice this already and might not know it. When given the freedom to produce, work is fun. Of course, when given the freedom, some BD's just sit around and gab all day. The theories that are outlined in this book are ones that the professionals that want to see their firms succeed will appreciate. Managers who like to give contradictory orders or undermine their subordinates will probably not understand this book
1451629184|5.0|THis book was great, I hope everyone has a chance to read it then you will not think your life is so bad. If she can come through everything she and her children went through, you can too. Life is what we make of it. I wish that we could get rid of all the child abuse in this world!!! Jaycee, I hope you and your girls and your mom have a wonderful life.
B005HEW7JG|5.0|To address the other review, this show was produced in 480p 4:3 and isn't available in HD anywhere because it simply doesn't exist in that format. The original 35mm film is undoubtedly safely stored somewhere, and can be encoded in HD, but there are many elements that only exist in SD, like the computer generated effects, which would have to done over from scratch, a process that would take hundreds of hours and almost certainly cost far, far more than such modernization would earn the studio.     Barring a miracle, the only Star Trek series we'll ever see in HD are Enterprise and TOS.
0553582038|4.0|Of course I say that hoping to sway you with THIS review. All I can say is that I was expecting a horrific read based on all the negative reviews made by unimaginative people. I literally had my breath taken away from me several times during the course of reading this book. So many munchable tidbits to keep your mind feasting just as the crows feast on a multitude of corpses in this novel; (mild spoiler) Good or bad the crows don't discriminate. So much good stuff and hard to talk about it without spoiling. It's all buildup to the ending that the last two books will lay out. Of course not much happened but the things that did were rife with meaning and foreshadowing. The most fascinating aspect was the exploration of the different gods. (Another mild spoiler) We all must face the Many-Faced God and none can deny it. Damn! This book really made me think. I put it above A Clash of Kings and almost equal to A Game Of Thrones but still not as good as A Storm Of Swords. Bottom line is this: don't listen to the negative reviews. My guess is these are a product of a culture that wants everything NOW and cannot see that it is the way there that means something. Once you're there you're done and you'll wish for the time when you were getting there. Savor it. Savor the possibilities. Savor the way to the new Seven Kingdoms ruled by Jon Snow and Daenerys (my prediction of course.) Stop listening to the negative reviews and have faith in George RR Martin. He will get us there and he will not disappoint. He hasn't so far.
B004V6X90W|1.0|What was this? It certainly wasn't entertainment. It was just erratic, excessively graphic for no reason, unfunny, no clear point. No reason to ever bother with this. Awful movie.
0345529057|5.0|This was a great value and a fantastic read.  Anyone who is interested in letting their mind roam freely will enjoy this set.  I would highly recommend it to amy of my friends.  I bought the set for my 12 year old niece and she thouroughly enjoyed it.
B001EN71DQ|1.0|1. All the characters suck.  2. The plot line is dull and boring. Too much political crap that's uninteresting.  3. The characters are stupid. They can't seem to put 2 and 2 together.   4. The action is over blown. Funny, I don't remember Obiwan jumping and spinning around when he battled Darth Vader in the original Star Wars.  5. The lovey dovey scenes are lame in the final movie.  6. One word \\"midicolorians\\" (probably not spelled right but who cares...  If I ever see these movies again, it would be too soon. Curse you cable for broadcasting these movies and making my eyes bleed and ears hurt.
0307946711|5.0|Saw the movie and LOVED LOVED LOVED it. Bawled my eyes out and Anne Hathaway was great. I want to read the book now. Should have done that first
B001AQO46E|5.0|The very first movie on tape I bought was True Lies. When I got a new DVD player for the first time, my first DVD movie I got was... True Lies... Now that I have an IPAD I wish i had a digital copy of it so I can re-watch it over and over again! Aliens on Blu ray + digital copy also a must!!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I could not put this book down from the first page.  I read the first two chapters from the webpage see inside.  Immediately bought it.  The characters were awesome.  You felt like your were there as it was played out.  I hope McGuire comes out with some more good stuff.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|For all the hoopla over the changed scenes, I am not that bothered by it. Do I like all the changes? No. But I'm not going to let it spoil my enjoyment of the movies. The gentlemanly thing for Lucas to do would be to include all versions of the films, like with nearly every other major Blu Ray release (Apocalypse Now, Blade Runner, Aliens, Star Trek The Original Series, etc), to make all camps happy. But I can live with the changes.     The actual movies themselves all look great in HD. Sound and picture is excellent and these movies have never looked better. The cartoonish CGI in The Phantom Menace shows up quite a bit in this set, though. Overall, in terms of actual HD presentation, they've done a great job.     The extras are actually my biggest disappointment. None of the deleted scenes from the prequel DVDs (Shaak Ti's death, Yoda arriving on Dagobah, etc) are included on this set. That's right, you'll have to keep your DVDs. That is very stingy, in my opinion, and it would not have been too hard to include the extras from the DVDs. It just reeks of a cash grab. None of the docos from the DVDs are here, either.     The extras we do have are threadbare. A few brief interviews (which sound like PR soundbites), concept art and photo galleries (who actually cares about these things?), stupid spoofs which one can find anywhere on the Net, etc. The deleted scenes that are presented here are in horrible condition. They're mostly unfinished, filthy prints, with no studio dubbing (so you can't really hear anything), or CGI animatics (in the case of the prequels).     The extras are very disappointing. Don't buy this for the extras.    The films look and sound fantastic. Get it for the movies on HD.
B002TZS5GU|4.0|On the surface, Carriers appears to be a very shallow movie.  We have the typical road trip mix of daredevil jock (Chris Pine as Brian Green) and his loose girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo), nebbish nerd and Brian's brother Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci), and pretty-but-distant blonde Kate (Emily VanCamp).  As the film progresses it becomes clear that the Greens stole the car, that they're on a road trip to a distant beach, and that asking \\"alive or dead?\\" when playing twenty questions is a \\"trick question.\\" And that's the moment when we realize a plague has brought about the end of the world.<br /><br />The brothers abide by three rules: 1) Avoid the infected at all costs because their breath is highly contagious. 2) Disinfect anything an infected person has touched in the last 24 hours.  3) The sick are already dead.<br /><br />This is a movie about stupid people teetering on the brink of insanity. Brian's gung-ho exterior hides a scarred soul that has buried too many bodies.  Danny's cowardly quiet conceals a calculating intellect.  Bobby seeks refuge in the possibility of having children with Brian, while Kate tries every payphone she can find to call her family in the vain hope that the line still works...and that there's anyone left to call.  These are deeply flawed survivors who have only made it so far because they flee at a moment's notice.<br /><br />In our fast-food, GPS-guided, mobile phone culture, our cars are oases in a sea of parkways. We have no idea who lives in the towns we pass through; the people we speak to at a rest stop or a restaurant we may never see again.  In Carriers, to stop moving is death, which is why rule number one is so important - in a world where everyone is infected, avoiding them means driving forever.<br /><br />Early on, the four survivors encounter Frank Holloway (Christopher Meloni) and his infected daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka).  Frank is convinced that if he can just get his daughter to a CDC hospital she will be cured. The four initially flee Frank's vehicle, only to return to it when they ruin their own.  Frank and his daughter are the first of a series of ethical choices the group will have to make about how far they will take the rules. The decision to bend those same rules slowly tears the group apart.<br /><br />When it becomes clear that there is no serum, no cure, and no hope, Frank - and the audience - faces the stark realization that life is not about survival.  It's about dying with dignity. As the doomed doctor at the CDC bivouac (Mark Moses) puts it, \\"sometimes choosing life is just choosing a more painful form of death.\\"  But instead of facing that terrible truth, the survivors hop in the car and run, again...<br /><br />This is probably the most depressing movie I've ever seen.  Children of Men and The Road are uplifting in comparison. Carriers may not have zombies, an antidote, or an uplifting ending, but it does have an uncompromising vision of an apocalypse that is truly personal. When the end comes, the foolish hop in their cars.  The wise hold their loved ones close and go out standing on their own two feet.e, only to return to it when they ruin their own.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm done buying copies of Star Wars. I've never heard of any director that has \\"fiddled\\" with his movies more than he. The last straw is the \\"nnnooooo\\" that he added to Vader at the end of Return of the Jedi. I'm just going to have to suffer with my DVD copies. It's one thing to fiddle with minor stuff but when you start messing with major aspects of key scenes, that tears it. Get bent George. And by the way, I wouldn't give you one nickel for the prequels. Absolute trash. I want my six plus hours I spent watching them back.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|I don't know how Mastodon do it, but once again they've managed to release an album that tops their previous effort as career highlight; Mastodon just keep getting better and better. Crack The Skye takes the ball 'Blood Mountain,' brought and runs with it, The music is even more progressive, even more virtuosic and the material is even more dense.<br /><br />Somehow Mastodon have also simultaneously reinvented themselves and stayed true to their trademark sound at the same time. The jangly, awkward riffs are the same and the complex jazzy drumming is the same, but the music has a fresh, cleaner and at first glance more 'listenable,' air to it; in addition to this the production is amazing, the artwork is in keeping with the tone of all Mastodon artwork to date and once again the album is a concept album. No doubt a few fans in Remission T-shirts will still label this album as a sell out despite the fact that this is Mastodon's least commercial offering to date due to the length, density and originality of the music.<br /><br />Fans of the direction Mastodon started to take with Leviathan and especially with Blood Mountain will welcome Crack The Skye as the next logical step; praising the numerous guitar solos, haunting clean vocals and entertaining lyrics.  Everything you'd expect in terms of passion and performance is represented here and represented in stronger doses than ever before. The album is bursting with new ideas, with exciting bass lines, complicated time shifts and yet all the force you'd expect from the band who wrote Remission.<br /><br />If you have an open mind there is a hell of a lot to enjoy here, such as the new Keys and synths, along with longer songs and cleaner vocals (plus more vocalists) that add whole new dimensions to the sound that Mastodon previously only hinted at in songs like 'Ol Nessie,' and 'Sleeping Giant.'<br /><br />Some may be surprised to find that in addition to the amazing Troy and the aggressive Brent, Brann Dailor appears to be lending his vocal talents to the album. Additionally, many fans will welcome Scott Kelly back for yet another wonderful guest vocal appearance.<br /><br />There is little point in naming standout tracks as the entire album is the best thing the band have ever done, but if I was forced to pick a favorite  I'd pick 'The Czar,' which is probably the coolest song you'll hear all year, that or 'The Last Baron,' which has some beautiful acoustic moments, some lead epic guitar moments and an awesome section that seems like a cheeky tribute to '21st Century Schizoid Man,' over all the song is like a bizarre cross between 'Trampled Under Hoof,' with 'This Mortal Soil,' and the drumming is just so impressive.<br /><br />Overall; Although at first the album may seem like a departure, repeat listens will reveal moments that could fit at the end of 'Hearts Alive,' or fit into the middle of 'Mother Puncher.' In fact the first single 'Divinations,' sounds like it could fit well on the Blood Mountain album. The most important thing however, is the sheer quality of music, I really can't recommend this album highly enough, to fans of metal, to fans of prog or just to anyone with an open mind.<br /><br />***This edition comes surprisingly with no slipcase but does have a gold coloured spine to match up with the rest of the Mastodon spines. Most importantly it comes with a hour and a half long making of DVD which is very entertaining and informative, which sheds lights on the writting process as well as the recording process and contains interviews with all band members and the new Keys player Richard Morris. Well worth the money to see the down to earth guys talk about their career, the new album and how it was made.***to the album.

Also, on larger levels there does not seem to be a way to zoom out or pan around to get the full view before committing to a move. Scoring system seems overly complex for a simple move based game -- I ignore it .

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I don't usually write reviews for films I buy from Amazon, but I just had to jump in on this one.    I've read too much Lucas bashing and non-theatrical version bashing so it comes down to this --    I don't watch Star Wars films everyday, so I couldn't tell you the difference between theatrical version vs. director version or whatever ...      I actually own the BluRay set, purchased from Amazon. I still don't understand how people write reviews about items they don't own or haven't seen, or items that haven't been released yet.    Bottom line you get six Star Wars films on BluRay plus hours and hours of extras (9 discs total) for $79.99.  Picture and sound are awesome.    The only thing is that the packaging could have been a little better.  If you want to, you can buy individual cases.    If you like the films, buy the set.  If you don't like the films, don't buy the set.  End of story ...  End of review ...
B003ZSJ212|3.0|Alright, so here it is. All the bad, right now:    Deleted scenes DO NOT include ALL deleted scenes. Most notably, Shaak-Ti's death is not included.  Changes to some movies are terrible and should not have been included.  Theatrical versions are not included.  Some of the effects got much worse. Most notably, Ki-Adi-Mundi (Pointed headed jedi) looks absolutely appalling in episode one.  Most deleted scenes are very difficult to watch as they are very, very early removals. Almost all nearly-complete deleted scenes (from 1-3, at least) are not included.  Difficult to navigate bonus disks.  Difficult to remove disks from case.  Does not include a description of bonus disks except on throw-away.    Alright, now all the good:    Menu is very clean.  1-3 look spectacular; definite improvements.  Extra content is really cool.  Case is really nice; seems durable.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It does have some very down parts, but the movie is a wonderful movie that teaches you cannot run away from who you are. It has wonderful songs that my 3 year old loves to sing. It has a wonderful climax and resolution. I would recommend for all to see at least once. I think every family with children should own this movie, we will watch it over and over.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|William Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST is probably his last play, written in 1610-11, and as such it has some of the more eloquent passages of soliloquies of any of his works. In the original version the story is set on a remote island, 'where Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan, plots to restore his daughter Miranda to her rightful place, using illusion and skilful manipulation. The eponymous tempest brings to the island Prospero's usurping brother Antonio and the complicit Alonso, King of Naples. There, his machinations bring about the revelation of Antonio's low nature, the redemption of Alonso, and the marriage of Miranda to Alonso's son, Ferdinand.' Enter Julie Taymor and the imaginative play becomes even more so with her deft re-writing and direction and use of visual effects.  In Taymor's versions 'the main character is now a woman named Prospera. Going back to the 16th or 17th century, women practicing the magical arts of alchemy were often convicted of witchcraft. In Taymor's version, Prospera is usurped by her brother and sent off with her four-year daughter on a ship. She ends up on an island; it's a tabula rasa: no society, so the mother figure becomes a father figure to Miranda. This leads to the power struggle and balance between Caliban and Prospera; a struggle not about brawn, but about intellect.'<br /><br />Taymor and Shakespeare together make the important character of Ariel, Prospera's obedient sprite, a thing of magic: Ben Wishaw darts and floats and flies about apparently in the buff in a most ingenious fashion, delivering his lines in perfect Shakespearean cadence (his 'Full fathom five thy father lies... ' is exquisite).  The transformation of Prospero to Prospera is magical with Helen Mirren once again proving that she is an incomparably fine actress (one great moment is her delivery of the lines 'Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and are melted into air, into thin air: And, like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the great globe itself, Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve And, like this insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep.')<br /><br />THE TEMPEST is an odd assortment of magic, treachery, young love, silly comedy, and odd goings on, but filled with a cast such as Taymor has selected it jumps alive with passion and glee.  Caliban is Djimon Hounsou, Miranda is Felicity Jones, The King of Naples is David Strathairn and his son Ferdinand is young Reeve Carney, Prospera's brother Antonio is Chris Cooper and his sidekick Sebastian is Alan Cumming, and the two actors assigned to the buffoon roles are Albert Molina and Russell brand.  Gonzalo is Tim Conti.  This  tightened Tempest works well though one wonders how much of the opening scenes' shipwreck (due to Prospera's calling upon the tempest) adds to the overall story.  Yet in Taymor's vision it all comes together beautifully.  The sung portions of the play and the musical sore in general are from the intelligent pen of Elliot Goldenthal.  Recommended!

Great  production on this CD, amazing artist all the way!!! 10 stars hands down...Buy it, take Adele's journey with her...through her break up.

0553573403|2.0|I agree with Amanda's review and would add that the repetition and the unrelated (re: plot) digressions make for a dreary read.  I actually enjoyed Book I, started flagging through II and III, and then fast forwarded on my Kindle through IV.  The violence, the sex, the betrayals--same old, same old.  In particular, his female characters are major disappointments.  Martin does seem to have an adolescent view of women's sexuality.

B0034G4OY0|4.0|\\"The Hereafter\\" (2010) is directed by Clint Eastwood. The film focuses on the lives of three people and how they eventually intersect. Mat Damon plays a Clairvoyant who has been trying to leave that side of his life behind him, and there is a television journalist (Cecile de France) who has a near death experience, and then there is a young boy whose brother's death has left him feeling alone. This movie is less about what possibly happens after death than how people with a common interest and need come together to share their special bond. The main characters in this film seem isolated, and lonely, and alienated from those around them because of their particular unique experiences. In this way the film is really about how people connect in this life and bridge the gap between their various islands of experience.<br /><br />This film looks exceptionally good on blu-ray, and included with the special features is an 89 minute long documentary about Clint Eastwood and his career.

B003L77GRO|4.0|I liken this season of \\"Dexter\\" to seasons 2 and 3 in that they tend to deal with Dexter's self discovery and his overall evolution as a serial killer in disguise as a human being.  Furthermore, the writing style and tone of this season seems to be setting the stage for what I feel could possibly be the end of Dexter's story in the next season or so. Also, I think I've become desensitized to the fact that Dexter is a killer and am rarely surprised at how or who he dispatches, which is why I've given this season 4 out of 5 stars.  I'm more concerned with how much longer he can get away with what he's doing, especially since his sister has come closer than ever before at discovering her brother's true nature.  In addition, the antagonists were not as engaging as in some of the past seasons, but overall season 5 is still a solid chapter in the Dexter storyline.  What makes Dexter so engaging is the fact that he does what many people wish they could do, take out the bad guys.  One of the drawbacks to this season is that he's taken on a partner against his will, which adds to the dramatic element of the storyline but detracts from the character of Dexter in that I don't think he would've taken on Julia Stiles as a sidekick regardless of Rita's death.  I think he would have tied up any loose ends as was suggested and continued doing what he does best; slinking in the shadows and taking out the bad guys.

B005974CNA|5.0|Simple and brief.  Dream Theater fan or not, this album is simply brilliant.  For the life of me I don't understand the negative reviews here.  Music is a matter of taste, always has been, always will be, but from the simple standpoint of the music, I can think of no other album I've purchased since Images and Words with the sonic ability to mesmerize.  I realize this album is new and the \\"new\\" sometimes wear off, but some remain in the ole playlist for a very long time.  This one will certainly remain in mine for years!  The sonic tapestry woven here is reminiscent of the aforementioned \\"Images and Words\\" but clearly stands apart.  Lyrics, music, arrangement are all very top notch.    Congratulations guys, this one is great!

B005H5H3LW|2.0|This movie did not do justice to the original story I grew up with.  I was expecting more battle scene, but instead got a small version of everything.  Some of the maneuvers the battleship did in the movie were beyond mediocre.  Maybe this movie should've been done in part 1, part 2, and part 3, like the Matrix.  Really, trying to put the whole story into one movie did not do the job: not even close pal.  And really, the battle scenes were like watching those from Battlestar Galactica mid 1970's.<br /><br />Ludicrous Speed --- And Beyond!!!!  Well, Almost.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I absolutely love this release. It is truly for the definitive release. Never have I had the urge to sit so close to the screen to get all the detail.    I first watched the original trilogy in 1995 on LaserDisc on a big screen. I remember not liking it too much. 1997 I saw the special edition on Laserdisc also. I loved the changes they made and for the first time I loved the trilogy with the release of the Special Edition. Lucas is a visionary to update outdated clunky models with bad makeup with CGI versions.    The best edit done since 1997 was the removal of that corny Emporer model with the monkey eyes superimposed of it. Replacing that with a superimposed Ian Abercrombie was the most brilliant move yet by Mr. Lucas.    Bad hue of the lightsabers inherent in many versions has been fixed, and the red hot white core was CGI'd in to the lightsabers in most cases.    The new ending to Jedi is awesome. I won't spoil it. I like all the edits to it however. I never cared for the ending originally as I don't particularly like ewoks but this new ending makes it far more palatable.     Those who want the horrible original theatrical versions will be disappointed to know that Lucas himself said they were destroyed as part of the retransfer for the 1997 special editions. He gracefully provided a professional LaserDisc AD conversion to DVD but people still weren't satisfied. Truly, Lucas is darned if he does and darned if he doesn't!     Replacing the poorly done Yoda puppet in Episode I with a CGI one was a very smart move. That was one thing that irked me wrong when I saw it in theaters. Now, Episode I is perfect to me.     Some gripes: Grain was artificially added unfortunately in some places for the prequel trilogy. This is necessary though because some shots were digital sourced and others film. You can't have inconsistencies where one scene has no grain and another has a bunch. Also, Ep. II-III were filmed in 1080p/24 and not 4K or 8K. I chalk this to technological limitations at the time. Unfortunately, the latter issue can never be rectified. It will always be in a resolution that isn't viable for excessive editing.     Overall I find the picture quality to be great -- plenty of bitrate. The audio was awesome on my Marantz SR4600. The dynamic range blows you out of your film viewing chair when starships explode.     I can't wait to see the 3D theatrical re-releases! With technology and graphic processing units getting more powerful and energy efficient simultaneously each day Lucas will be able to make non-discernible CGI models for the 3-D re-releases.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Amazing book! So much happens over the span of this one book that it more than makes up for the slower pace of \\"Clash of Kings\\", the second book in the series. Some parts were so shocking that I had to reread certain passages to ensure that I read what I thought I read which I'm not sure has ever happened before reading a novel. Other parts were tragic and difficult to make it through, especially for the characters I empathised with. One of the things I noticed about this book that took this one a step up for me was how multi-layered the characters have become which goes a long ways towards establishing believablity of the story and their motivations. There are no nefarious moustache twirling villians (well, perhaps the Mountain) or pure heroes which is a far more interesting story than most I've read.<br /><br />As for the stories themselves......(with very little/vague spoilers)....Jon makes it through a pretty intense set of events to end up in an unlikely place. Catelyn continues to have tragedy upon tragedy heaped upon her and just when it seems she will finally have peace, the epilogue appears to change all that. Arya has her usual type of adventure and ends up in an interesting pairing for a while. Also, her story is a bit disturbing in how dark her actions/thoughts are becoming though I suppose given what she's going through, it's understandable to a degree...still, I worry about how she'll come out of all this. Samwell is a welcome addition that overlaps with Jon's story quite nicely. Tyrion's story continues to be among the best story in the books and his actions towards the end certainly throw things into disarray. Jamie ends up being an unexpected suprise of a character who I quite like in spite of his actions in certain places in book 1 and his pairing with Brienne was well done. Stannis becomes a more nuanced character here with Davos and Melisandre at his side. Sansa has gone from one bad situation where she's manipulated to another. I feel a bit sorry for her at times and other times not so much. :) Bran's story is interesting, but very little happens with his group in this book. I love his companions, though it would be really cool if they end up being not so nice and not who they appear to be.<br /><br />This book is clearly the best in the series up to this point and everything that defined and was good in the first two books was taken up a few notches. It's been interesting to see how the various characters are starting to interesect and it'll be even more fun as these events lead to the eventual coming of winter, the war with the others and how these various characters will fit into that end game. Highly recommended.er at times and other times not so much. :) Bran's story is interesting, but very little happens with his group in this book.

I sent my boss the receipts for each day,  which I usually don't get in until the end of the week. He was able to have a check printed for me when I showed up on Friday instead of Monday. That was the best part, and it was all because I was able to get him the receipts before hand. I give this a 5 star. even if your using it for simple stuff not work related.

Neither people nor \\"remedies\\"  Yes, there have been lots of quacks, but as the biography shows, not all people in the non-alternative industry have been straight and narrow either.

This latest Tolley's Tax Guide from LexisNexis -- the thirtieth annual edition of this plain speaking and reliable work -- incorporates all the changes in taxation law and practice since publication of the previous edition of 2010 - including of course the 2011-12 tax rates and allowances.  Obviously accountants or tax lawyers for that matter, cannot live without their yearly Tolley's.  But what is always noteworthy about Tolley's, as the Times has commented, is that `people with not financial experience can dip into the guide for clear answers to specific problems.'<br /><br />The expressed aim of the book is 'to provide clear and concise guidance on all aspects of taxation that are likely to be encountered day to day'.  Whether you are a professional tax adviser, or just an ordinary personal or business taxpayer, you'll find this volume indispensable.  As the publishers put it, this Guide `will show you how to reduce your tax bills and stay on top of your tax affairs'.  How handy, when you're doing your tax return.<br /><br />For this year, 2011, it is especially important to have this latest edition to hand as it includes the main changes that have been enacted by the Finance Act 2011 as well as various statutory instruments in the previous 12 months, including rates and allowances pertaining to income tax and tax credits...corporation tax...capital gains tax...inheritance tax and VAT.  Chapter 9 deals with the latest developments in dealing with HMRC.  Chapters 10 and 13 cover changes in national insurance rates and childcare relief.<br /><br />Changes to pension provision and capital allowances are also covered and there are also chapters on council tax and business rates, NI contributions, statutory sick pay and maternity pay, as well as adoption and paternity pay.  Usefully, the book contains many illustrative examples to show how the various provisions actually work in practice.  There are tax points at the end of most chapters - over 300 of them -- to demonstrate tax planning opportunities and there are numerous practical planning hints and strategies.<br /><br />Logically structured, this Tolley's is clearly laid out with headings and a detailed index at the back so that whatever you need to know is easy to look up within its almost 900 pages.  For exceptionally complicated tax matters, you are sensibly advised to seek professional advice.<br /><br />Here then, is a clear, concise reference to keep to hand on your shelf, or indeed at your elbow on your desk.  AccountingWEB has called it `the nation's favourite tax book' - and if you rush out and buy this latest Tolley's, you'll certainly find out why.the book contains many illustrative examples to show how the various provisions actually work in practice.

1400032717|4.0|I'm reading many novels, but I find myself being absorbed by novels where people need to overcome obstacles within themselves in order to resolve or come to terms with the obstacles surrounding their physical life. For example, I started The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time and finished it today. It's an amazing tale about a high functioning autistic savant whose parents are behaving foolishly. Christopher is the narrator and his problems with living are astronomically complicated, but his parents are also suffering through difficulties which while not on the same scale as their son are also complicated. All three have to struggle with their own natures to actually solve anything, and the learning to quell their inner voices for better functioning does not mean they get what they wanted. It's an unfair compromise with Reality, and Reality imposes the final terms and boundaries of their hopes. Even though Christopher is the one diagnosed as 'special needs' it's obvious his parents are struggling with the special needs that come from living with a kid far different from ordinary children. Christopher is high maintenance and there do not seem to be any rewards in parenting such a child. He requires abnormal behavior from everyone around him that must be in a certain regulated and regimated fashion that soothes him enough to not act out. His parents need his affection and love, but he can't tolerate their looking at him or touching him, much less any emotions. The book is Christopher's journal so in a bit the reader soon gets a read on who Christopher is. He is charming in an odd way, he is so helpless but he cannot comprehend the entirety of his deficits or the serious handicapping of his dream to be an astronaut. Although he cannot bear emotions from anyone he is not unemotional. Anyone with empathy feels Christopher's agonies but he cannot be consoled by empathy on any level. His favorite sleeping dream is when he walks an earth where he is the only person alive. This is not a person to love, yet his parents adore him while at the same time tearing their lives to pieces by their unrequited love for him. It is a desperate existence for all of this family, but nothing can be done except to bear it, handling each Autistic meltdown with the only response that works: waiting it out patiently sitting nearby until it's over. I could not do this, raise a child this functionally broken without any reward or affection or gratefulness. Even dogs can like and love back, enjoy petting or want to be with you - none of which is something Christopher can give or do. However, these parents never stop loving their son. It appears the Special Needs Counselor is the one person who helps Christopher understand how to share his life as much as he can, which is little better than understanding how different people are from him and that he must tolerate their presence without instigating or resorting to violence. He learns phrases that are meaningless to him, such as \\"how are you today\\" simply because he has learned these things minimize his contact with people. To not be polite extends the always unwelcome interest of all persons in his vicinity. This book is well-written and imagined, I could not put it down. Christopher's mind is as illuminated as a normal person would want from a good book. The parents are not special people except in their love for their unloving child. They are blue collar, not particularly sophisticated or wealthy. The son baffles them and in their sorrow and disappointment which they cannot verbalize they attempt to soothe themselves with alcohol and sex, but finds themselves once the temporary diversion is over in the same depressing reality. There is no cure, only palliatives. A strong book that enlightens readers about the cruel inescapable cage the handicapped child and his parents must come to endure, finding little help except for whatever resources they can discover within themselves and if lucky, in the community.mmunity.
B004SUDQE0|1.0|The one star is not for the movie, which I like, but for the DVD itself.  It's letterboxed, which means the viewer sees a small rectangle in the middle of the screen.  The disk is labeled Widescreen, NTSC, with a DVD date of 2011.  One would assume it's anamorphic (fills a 16x9 screen)--especially considering that there's no mention of it's being letterboxed.  But letterboxed it is.  I certainly would not have ordered it had I known this.

But they never frightened or abused me. In fact they merely showed me the door and let me chose. For example I was given violin lessons and allowed to quit in a month - I found it so painful to hear the squeaky sound. I was allowed to choose what major to concentrate on instead of \\"you must study business because you will make more money...\\" I ended up choosing computer engineering and couldn't be happier with my choice.    We have 2 girls, age 10 and 6. Although we are strict in sending our girls to a nice private school near we live, making sure they complete their homework (including the bonus questions) every night, controlling the amount of TV hours (we don't allow them to watch what's on the cable channels. We \\"make\\" them watch high quality classic movies such as \\"Marry Poppins\\", \\"Sound of Music\\" and etc), helping them find an exciting sport (they both ended up with swimming, after we allow them to try golf, soccer and tennis.), and encouraging them to get outside our comfort zone of Chinese culture to learn from those whose predecessors had been here a lot longer. I am deeply disturbed by the stereotype and insult that the author created to not only us as a typical Chinese family but also other ethinity groups.     I feel like apologizing on her behalf to the \\"western\\" group. We are not what she described, and although we believe in many aspects of our Chinese parenting approach, we also quite respect the way kids are raised here in terms of emphasis on \\"social skills\\", \\"art and literature\\", and \\"the importance of having funand finding their real passions and interests\\".
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a great strategy game that keeps you busy and entertained very well.  I have only played it today but find the changing scenarios and tools help keep you engaged rather than bored like some games do.  I definitely recommend this app for good fun without alot of pressure.  Many thanks to Developer and Amazon.

0553582038|5.0|Other 5-star reviewers have praised and defended this book at greater length and with great eloquence than I can; go read them!  I'll just say that while someone coming to FOC cold would be startled by what it contains and what it omits, I think that what it contains is just terrific.

B0046E825G|1.0|Stephanie Meyer writes vampire fiction as many teenage girls do -- overblown writing, sexy cold vampires, and a vacuously attractive heroine who serves as the readers' stand-in. WARNING: spoilers.<br /><br />But as fluffy and shameless as Meyer's past work has been, she dips far below her past nadirs in the ghastly, sluggish \\"Breaking Dawn.\\" There's a grotesque twist toward the book's spluttering end, and it becomes painfully obvious that Meyer was determined to give everyone an utterly happy ending. And she'll sacrifice whatever plot or characterization it takes to get that happy ending.<br /><br />Resident \\"Mary Sue\\" Bella is getting the royal treatment from her fiance Edward in the days before they marry. The wedding goes off with only one hitch -- her ex-love-interest Jacob's anger at her impending transformation into a vampire. But newlywed bliss doesn't make for a terribly interesting grand finale, so we get the expected twist -- Bella's pregnant with a half-vampire baby.<br /><br />Jacob becomes even more upset when he witnesses the violent birth of Bella's magical super-special baby Renesmee (nickname: Nessie) -- only to have something unexpected (and very icky) occur between himself and the newborn. But turning into a vampire won't solve Bella's problems, because it turns out that other vampires are gathering in preparation to attack... and it's due to the birth of Renesmee.<br /><br />Authors often create all sorts of endings for popular series -- sad ones, happy ones, bittersweet ones, and occasionally ones that make absolutely no sense in relation to the series. Unfortunately in \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" Meyer has opted for the last type of ending -- and that finale starts the moment Bella gets pregnant, and becomes more absurd and inane as the story drags on. It ends up being rather difficult to care what happens to any of the characters, because the readers are being assaulted by a string of absurd plot twists.<br /><br />Not that there's much of a plot to twist -- Meyer desperately pads out the flimsy storyline with a lot of florid prose and endless melodrama. The first part of the book is pretty much consumed by wedding drivel and subsequent soft-focus sex, but after Bella becomes pregnant everything spirals down the drain. All this drama culminates in a ghastly birth scene that may turn some readers off ever having kids. Vampire teeth are involved.<br /><br />Having exhausted what little plot can be wrung from a Edward-Bella marriage and subsequent pregnancy, Meyer struggles to somehow fix this by introducing a Big Bad Threat to the new family's happiness. Unfortunately, it has all the climactic impact of a soggy firecracker. As the final indignity, Meyer crashes down a vaguely pedophilic plot twist for Jacob, so he won't be too lonely. You can almost hear the thin plot cracking in a thousand places, as Meyers strains to give a Happily-Ever-After for everybody.<br /><br />Bella remains one of the most vacuous heroines in modern literature -- she has the passion and intellect of a wet mop, but once she becomes a vampire she is also shockingly graceful, beautiful, powerful and self-controlled. In case you haven't noticed, she's just amazing in every way -- and it's difficult to control one's gag reflex when reading about a glaring self-insert made so utterly perfect.<br /><br />Not that the supporting characters help much -- Edward has yet to develop an actual personality beyond adoring Bella, and poor Jacob is treated like a maniac. And the Ultra-Super-Special Vampire Baby is almost as nauseating -- and even more featureless a personality -- as the mother who spawned her.<br /><br />\\"Breaking Dawn\\" would better have been called \\"Breaking Down.\\" Stephanie Meyer had a good thing going with the vacuous vampire soap opera, but here she rips it apart and turns it inside out.

B0008ENHT4|5.0|A smooth purchase. A great movie. I wish everything  went as good. Amazon is the only way to buy item you need.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|Unless so many others, I actually purchased and watched the Blu Ray set before I set out to attack it.  In all fairness I see why people are up in arms. The majority of Star Wars fans want the pre-1997, unaltered versions of the original Star Wars trilogy.  IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!!!!!!!  Well, at least not while owner of all things Star Wars, George Lucas, still breathes.      Now for the movies themselves.  The audio and visual components of all six films are virtually flawless.  No Star Wars movie has looked better in the home setting.  My main problem with the visuals is with the OT special editions.  Brand new digital effects against twenty year old footage never did blend well and in high def the contrast is even more noticeable.      As for the prequel trilogy, the movies are what they are.  Watching The Phantom Menace again for the first time since it was in theaters I didn't hate it as much as I remembered, however, it's still has some really bad dialogue.  Actually, all three prequels have moments that make me cringe however I'm not going to bad mouth the movies here. What can be said that Mr. Plunkett from Red Letter Media hasn't already covered?    As for the original trilogy and the alterations, here's my analogy:  I grew up in Southern California and went to Disneyland several times a year as a during the seventies and eighties.  In the last twenty years the park has made several changes that I don't care for including putting the Rocket Jets on the ground level, adding lame music to Space Mountain, making the Haunted Mansion less scary, and making Pirates of the Caribbean more politically correct.  I don't like the changes but I am still always happy to spend a day at Disneyland and not let the changes ruin my day.  Same with those old Star Wars movies.  Nope, Greedo doesn't need to shoot first.  We don't need to see the guy in the Wampa suit, and we sure don't need to have Darth Vadar scream \\"Noooooo!\\" as he destroys the Emperor.      Some complaints:  This isn't even close to being a be all, end all boxed set.  Footage such as the original Jabba The Hut as missing.  I would also have been nice to include a high def version of \\"Empire of Dreams\\".  I did find it a hoot watching the deleted scenes from the original trilogy and I must say the editors deserve a big bonus.      If you really really really have to have the unaltered versions to enjoy the Star Wars experience, don't bother with this set.   No, I don't like most of the changes made over the years, but I still enjoy those movies.    Peace.

B001FB55L2|5.0|This movie has been out for a while, but I never had the opportunity to see it. I was glad that I finally did. Many may not appreciate Tobey Maguire in such a dark role, but he did an excellent job. Really, I guess unless you have been to such a dark place as is portrayed in this film, you may not be able to fully appreciate it. If you have or know someone that has, it is real and has significant meaning. Natalie Portman, can never do wrong in any film (yeah, I'm a bit biased) and she doesn't disappoint in this one. I rarely buy movies on DVD, but I did purchase this one. This film is worth watching in my opinion.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|This is the ALBUM I've been waiting 21 years for. In 1990 when i was 15, my favorite album was Persistence of Time. I remember having tickets to see them live in Sydney at the Hordern Pavillion. I was off school with the FLU and had to miss the concert. I was spewing! I vowed not to listen to Post Belladonna Anthrax, and i never did. Saw them on the BIG4 blu ray and loved it. This band got me through some tough times growing up. Particularly during State of Euphoria era. I let out alot of frustration blaring that album as well as Persistence of Time. I came into this Album open to the possibility that i might not like it, thinking its been along time since they last recorded (with Belladonna). Man, my senses were totally friggin BLOWN away. This album never leaves my IPOD. Cool Cover art too. I would go as far as to say, best ANTHRAX album of all time. Big Call i know. But wait until you hear it. I can't wait to see them back In Australia. I would run though suburbs of vicious unleashed dogs to get there this time. Thank you ANTHRAX for delivering THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR. You guys ROCK !!!!!! Please don't fight anymore, and keep the CURRENT lineup strong.  Mark   Sydney Australia
B0041T52S6|5.0|Keeping in mind that I despise Michael Cera, I absolutely loved this movie. The special effects are so close to videogaming that I would caution anyone to NOT hold a gaming controller during the movie. The acting is good, but realistic (thanks to the down-to-earth dialogue) and the movie does its very best to avoid disappointing fans of the graphic novel series.  If that isn't enough to convince you this is worth a watch, my girlfriend dislikes Michael Cera as much as I do and is not a gamer-gal.  Fifteen minutes in, she was completely into it.
0393064476|1.0|For the past 40 years Prof. Stephen Greenblatt has been an influential scholar of Renaissance literature. He truly does know his stuff. However, his influence has not always been seen as beneficial because of an unfortunate tendency towards questionable interpretation. Too often, his books resemble very tall, very unstable houses of cards - impressive, but liable to collapse at the slightest breath of critical analysis.<br /><br />Greenblatt's Hot New Book is The Swerve: How the World Became Modern. \\"Modern,\\" in his view, means \\"Non-Religious\\" and the swerve came when a 15th century Italian scholar, on a book-hunting tour through old German monasteries, stumbled across a copy of On the Nature of Things, a philosophic Latin poem written by Lucretius shortly before the birth of Christ. With the rediscovery of this one ancient manuscript, Greenblatt believes, the Western mind was able to liberate itself from religious dogma, rediscover the joy of living for this life (rather than the After-life), and create the Modern World we know today.<br /><br />This narrative is more than a little over-the-top. It is also simply wrong, on two fundamental counts<br /><br />Greenblatt believes that Lucretius' philosophy had been a dominant school of thought in the ancient world, but was stifled in the early centuries AD because it contradicted the doctrine of the Christian Church. He also believes that this same philosophy - rediscovered in the early 15th century - was the great Game-Changer in Renaissance thought. Neither belief is true.<br /><br />Any competent historian of ancient philosophy knows that, far from being a dominant force, Epicureanism was actually a minor player in the world of Greco-Roman thought - much less popular and influential than its principle rivals, Stoicism and Platonism. The philosophy of Lucretius failed to catch on not because it was un-Christian, but because pagan Greeks and Romans found its dogma of the Randomness of the Universe so intellectually and spiritually unsatisfying. Stoicism and Platonism were very different, but both schools were convinced that we live in a Cosmos, not a Chaos. Both taught that our world is not an infinite collection of atoms bouncing around randomly and forming temporary - and meaningless - conglomerates of Being. It is the product of Providential Wisdom.<br /><br />The Epicureanism of Lucretius was no more dominant after the Christian Middle Ages than it had been before. Throughout the 15th, 16th and early-17th centuries, Platonism and Stoicism (especially the former) were once again the schools of thought most enthusiastically revived, and most influential. To contradict just one example in Greenblatt's book, Botticelli's art was philosophically informed by the Renaissance Neoplatonism of Marsilio Ficino, not by Lucretius. In the early modern world as in pagan antiquity, Epicureanism occupied a position rather like today's American Libertarian Party - a fringe-movement with a few passionate devotees but no real clout.<br /><br />Many scholars questioned Greenblatt's insights into Shakespeare (as found in his 2005 \\"speculative biography\\" of the Bard, Will in the World). I believe even more doubt will be heaped upon this very questionable reading of early modern philosophy.cism and Platonism were very different, but both schools were convinced that we live in a Cosmos, not a Chaos.

B0050SYS5A|4.0|My family has a small living room, so we ordered the Zoom, we have our Kinect mounted on top of our LG 55LW5300 television with a flat screen tv mount, at roughly 5ft of height. Unit has a natural tilt toward the ground and we left it like that. Our room has one ceiling lamp at the mid point of the room, it isnt too bright, but it isnt dark by any means. We tested the unit with Kinect Sports, Michael Jackson Experience, Child of Eden, Your Shape, and a MMA fighting game. The Sports game worked the best with the tracking at 100%, while Child of Eden was 75%-85% on hand tracking. It isnt perfect but it does allow us to use our Kinect now. The only thing I would change is to stregnthen the IR sensor for better tracking. I give it a 4 of 5 since it does work but not always at 100%. It seems to have minor problems with hand movement, but only really a problem on Child of Eden at this point, it seems that this game resets the \\"brightness\\" or \\"Contrast\\" to a lower level. I cant say this is a Zoom issue. If you dont need it to use your Kinect wait for Version 2 to fix these issues...

1933633867|2.0|Prof. Graeber is obviously an extremely competent anthropologist, and this well referenced book (with an over forty page bibliography!) contains some very plausible propositions.  One is that credit systems emerged before barter and money, and that the state or other authorities with a monopoly on violence instated currency from the top down. Another is that our modern fiat money system is built on nothing more than trust, unreflective of any fundamentals whatsoever (although this is obvious to anyone who has studied our modern financial system, and is noted in many of the textbooks Prof. Graeber likes to slight). Unfortunately,  apart from these two ideas, this book is disorganized, sloppily written and lacks an overarching thesis to tie its chapters together. One theme Prof. Graeber seeks to return to again and again is that our language of morality is shrouded in words we also use to describe financial transactions, but this rather simple observation is drowned in anthropological anecdotes and a rather long winded explication of Bruno Tharet's bizzare \\"primordial debt theory\\", both of which tend to obfuscate rather than clarify the matter at hand. His investigation of different modes of economic relations, which he titles communistic, exchange, and hierarchical strikes me as clumsily composed and derivative-there have been many challenges to the rational actor model of economic decision making (by Amartya Sen, Robert Frank etc) that Graeber both fails to mention and which are much more illuminating to the interested reader. His final chapter is particularly odd. He urges us to feel sympathy for the non-industrious poor  because they \\"aren't doing us any harm\\"  He attempts to refute the assertion  of Austrian economist Von Mises (who I am not fan of) that in our current economy all creditors are not evil landlords but often ordinary individuals with a sneer rather than an argument. He encourages us to think of ways to reorganize our social and economic relations so that we are not so reliant upon debt, but does not offer any ideas in this vein (although he has challenged his responsibility to do so). There are many problems in the world today, from poverty in \\"third world countries\\" to lack of healthcare in the US. Rather than muse on the genealogy of morals and yearn for a return to the relations of extant primitive tribes, I'd prefer to get down to the hard business of figuring out pragmatic solutions to relieve suffering and improve our quality of life. While this book does offer some very creative thinking, I am not sure I would recommend it.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I AM LEGEND is a masterful horror story.  The story opens with the television interview of a medical researcher (Emma Thompson) discussing how the measels virus has been genetically engineered to cure cancer.  Suddenly the film flashes to the haunting images of an abandoned and overgrown New York three years later.  Military officer and virus specialist Robert Nevile (Will Smith) prowls the streets with his dog by day scavenging and sending out messages for any survivors of the pandemic which swept the globe.  By evening, Nevil withdrawls to his fortified house/labratory carefully disguising his presence.  The cancer cure of course went horribly wrong with well over 5 billion people killed by the virus.  Hundreds of million more were mutated into ferocious nocturnal beings constantly in search of prey.    The film is action packed, melacholy, haunting, and at times very intense.  I would not recommend it for younger children due to the frightening scenes.  Smith shows off his considerable acting talent as his character exhibits a full range of human emotion.  The scenes of an abandoned New York with its blown bridges is haunting; especially memorable is a scene of Nevile golfing off an abandoned aircraft carrier.  Here the seemingly lone surviror stands dwarfed amidst the ruins of civilization.  It gets one thinking how fragile society can be.  Surprisingly some scenes are even emotionally powerful--especially the flashbacks of Nevile's  family being killed in the final flight from Manhattan before complete quaranteen went into effect.  The cinematography is also competent.      An interesting aspect late in the film differs considerably from Matheson's book (actually the film itself is far different from the novel).  The irony of the novel is that the character essentially demythologizes his vampire antagonists before ultimately becoming the basis of a legend for a new post-human society.  In this film version Nevile apparently rediscovers God's purpose for his life at the very end as he realizes what he can do for the surviving human society.  Although I wont go further into detail about the ending it is hopefully but not entirely happy.  I have read Matheson's novel, watched the Vincent Price \\"Last Man on Earth\\" and seen most of the Charleton Heston film \\"The Omega Man.\\"  This update is my favorite interpretation of the story including the novel.  Although Heston was one of my favorite actors and I generally enjoy Vincent Price, I must say that Smith's performance as Nevile surpasses both in my opinion.    Overall a fine horror/action film which really transcends its genre into some effective drama.  I would not recommend it for children though.

0440245915|5.0|this was my first Grisham novel and I absolutely loved it. It is a bit longer than most of his other novels, but this is due to its thoroughness. This story is about a black girl who gets raped in a white town, and an unsatisfied father takes justice into his own hands, and has to defend himself in front of a white jury. The story is very heavy on racism, and the \\"N\\" word is used on almost every page. It has lots of twists and turns, and will have you guessing till the last page.

B005974CNA|4.0|I'll leave the track by track reviews to the those who ably preceeded me. Instead I'd like to focus on the fact that, for me, this is the most exciting and unified effort by Dream Theater since TRAIN OF THOUGHT. These guys are most certainly firing on all cylinders and finally firing as a unified band. Gone are the overblown guitar solos, the circus-like keyboard flourishes and yes, drums as a lead instrument (sorry Mike but your drumming and ego just got in the way.)  Instead we have a unified Dream Theater playing as if they were an entirely new band. Mike Mangini is a welcome addition to the drum chair and while he does have some Potnoy-like moments, as the recording progresses we get to hear more of his own flourishes come to the forefront (my personal choice would've been Marco Minneman and judging from the accompanying DVD, it almost appears a forgone conclusion that Mangini was the choice from the first audition.......his of course. But I digress.). Perhaps in subsequent recordings Mike will leave a greater imprint as his tracks were recorded after the fact.    The production by John Petrucci and mixed by Andy Wallace is good but Wallace does bury John Myung in the mix leaving him to suffer the same fate that Martin Mendez of Opeth has endured over much of his recording career. However, over their last 3-4 recordings his bass has been brought more to the forefront giving a fuller sound to the band. Perhaps SOMEONE could do the same for John as well and for Mike whose drums were pretty decently recorded but the cymbals needed to be miked better. Sometimes they were almost lost in the mix.    Those complaints aside, Dream Theater can hold their heads high as they've created a recording to remember

B001PJRAUS|4.0|Very compelling story and often funny - quite unpredictable as well.  I found myself caring about what would happen to the characters, especially poor Jane.    I liked Amanda at first.  I liked her love for Pride and Prejudice, and her longing for a world of manners and true love.  However, when she actually was given the chance to enter that world, she repeatedly showed herself to be unworthy of it.  She is crude, she gets drunk at a party, and she teaches Lydia bad things.  She had once professed to know and love the world of the Austens, but when she doesn't get her way in the matter of marriage she presumes to lecture a heartbroken Darcy about the lack of \\"emotional integrity\\" she sees in the Regency culture.  Very offensive.  Clearly she doesn't belong in his world.  She should have gone back where she came from once she had brought Lizzie back to her rightful time.

B004EPYZUI|2.0|There are some creative writers who shouldn't direct. Though I like \\"Love Actually,\\" the lengthy romantic comedy would have been much better with a director other than Richard Curtis. There are also some creative directors who shouldn't write. Visually dazzling as it may be, \\"Sucker Punch,\\" for which director Zack Snyder himself wrote the original story, needs a better writer.    After the film's introduction that tells the back story of a young girl nicknamed \\"Baby Doll\\" (Emily Brown), we are ushered into the Lennox House, a mental asylum where Baby Doll is locked up by her abusive step-father and will have to undergo a lobotomy surgery. There, as a way to escape from the grim reality, Baby Doll creates a fantasy world of her own, where she and four other heroine (or \\"dancers\\") - Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone) and Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish) - will fight the WWI German zombie soldiers and dragons.    The screenplay by Zack Snyder and Steve Shibuya looks like a whimsical assortment of ideas they came up with brainstorming. It does not even try to explain why Baby Doll has to fight three giant samurai in Japanese temple. Scott Glenn shows up as The Wise Man, telling her to collect five items to be free, and that's all. Well, I really don't care these things as long as the film offers some creative and original ideas, which it fails to do.    Let's face it. For all nice costumes of the heroines, most things you see in the noisy CGI-heavy battles are derivative. The idea of Baby Doll fighting a giant samurai, which should be given more originality, soon becomes stale with unimaginative combat styles that you saw somewhere before. A bigger problem is that initial excitement fades soon because in the fantasy world (or the \\"real\\" world) there is no one to root for. The visual extravaganza is like watching someone playing the video game.     Clearly the players did a considerable amount of training for the stunt, and you can see that intheir fight sequences. They deserve a much better film.
B001HN6918|5.0|This was sooo good, better than the first one in my opinion. I really want to know when it will come out on DVD but it doesnt say. I hope not until december or november because then ill be mad. The film itself was just spectacular, great storyline, good humor, and the ending made you thinking like a cliffhangar ya no. And of course lots of action to behold.

1455816361|5.0|The Colonial Radio Theatre's adaptation of Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is one of those rarest of the rare gems in audiobooks, a rendition that not only faithfully brings the written word to life but also breathes exciting new life into it. As a child reading The Martian Chronicles for the first time, I was always puzzled at how all of these different stories on Mars could take place in the same universe. With CRT's rendition, however, all the pieces fell into place, and I listened, captivated, from the moment Earth first made contact with Mars to the moment long after the colonists have returned home.<br /><br />The choice to include Usher II was a little unusual -- it doesn't quite fit the rest of the stories in tone -- but the story is superbly told, and a joy to listen to, so I forgive the slight shift in tone for its telling.<br /><br />Fans of Bradbury should buy this immediately! You won't be disappointed.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me how creative Paul McCartney is...and that he's maintained that creativity for so long.  I'm also thankful that his (and the Beatles) music have produced such timeless classics that have spanned multiple generations.<br /><br />All that being said, this album is just another example of how artistically diverse Paul McCartney is.  I have to say, I was a little puzzled regarding the categorization of this album as \\"Electronic\\" music (at least that's how my local library had it labeled -- maybe because of the album title??).  While experimental and enhanced with effects, it's not much more digital-sounding than your average Coldplay album.  To me, the only songs that really embraced strong electronic elements are \\"Lovers In A Dream\\", \\"Universal Here, Everlasting Now\\", and the hidden/delayed track after \\"Don't Stop Running\\".  Even then, I would associate the effects with more of an Ambient music quality.  With this being considered, the music was not what I was expecting (I know...I should have listened to the samples!).  Yet, it did not make it any less enjoyable.<br /><br />Truly, this album takes me back to the days of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Revolver\\", where the Beatles pioneered so many sounds and effects with their studio recordings.<br /><br />\\"Electric Arguments\\" is a must-have for any fan of McCartney and the Beatles.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|I bought this mostly because of the amazing special features and HD content, but it wasn't without some chalkboard screeching visuals and audio that really puts a damper on the classic Original Trilogy films.     What I seriously don't get after all these years is the resounding voices of the vast majority of people isn't enough to get through to Lucas' head that people want what they fell in love with, not a shoddy CGI-updated version of something that really didn't need additions to hold up the films today.  They were wonderful as-is.     I could understand improving the composites and removing matte boxes and saber fixes and such, things that were in error to be fixed in that regard I would be all for, but the Original Trilogy movies are now just riddled with crap that makes my eyes and ears unpleased.     I can't believe \\"NOOOO!\\" Was added to ROTJ and I still can't get over Lapti Nek being cut entirely and the addition of the Sarlaac beak. If you're being digested slowly over 1000 years I would say just a static open gaping mouth is FREAKY as-is and needs no stupid CG beak!     I really don't know what's gone through Lucas' head over the years, but these changes are absurd. There's a big difference between fixes and changes. I welcome the great new 6.1 sound mix. WELL DONE!     George, you've clearly disappointed MANY in what you've changed in the Original Trilogy. I don't think i've ever seen such a consistency in complaints about these blu-rays anywhere else in a movie series.    To the people who say \\"GEORGE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS!\\"  Yes, he can, and they are his movies. Total given and I understand.  I guess you could think of it as you are living in your house as a small child, your parents give you a bedroom and you love it for years.  One day they come in when you're 15 and say, \\"We're going to patch up the window, lower the ceiling a foot and paint your walls neon orange cuz we felt it needed to be changed.  So you're now going to have to live with that.\\"Would you like that?  Of course not!  The room is part of your life and important to you, but that doesn't matter because your parents can do to it whatever they like because it's your parents' house, not yours.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|Bought this for my 8 and 9 year olds. They have the rookie and original and have completed both of them. When this arrived there was already a screw that was out. Since it is completely enclosed there is no way to fix it yourself. I sent it back and received a replacement but have since read that others have had similar problems. They love this toy, but it is definitely something you have to be very careful with.
B000683VI4|4.0|The Notebook is a great love story and the movie delivers very well. Both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams do a wonderful job as the young Noah & Allie. I watch my copy of this movie quite often and so I obviously love it. Each of us would be so lucky if we had a love like theirs (yes, probably a love found mostly in movies and books).    So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Well, there is one reason which I wonder bothers anyone else out there. While I adore James Garner and Gena Rowlands and admit they are both wonderful actors, I question having them play the older Noah & Allie as they look nothing like the younger version of Noah & Allie. From their facial structure to their body frames it's hard for me to see them as the older Noah & Allie. They just don't fit the roles, although their acting is wonderful and touching. This is my biggest problem with the movie. Personally I would have liked to have seen both Ryan Gossling & Rachel McAdams \\"aged\\" or at least have someone play them that resembled them a bit better.     Plus I have to admit it would be nice to know what happened to Allie's parents. (Going to get the book to find out).     Overall The Notebook is a wonderful movie if you're willing to suspend belief for a bit.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I purchased the 2004 box set on DVD along with each \\"prequel\\" film as they were released. Then I purchased the same Original Trilogy again on DVD just to get the REAL Trilogy. No one made me buy these films, I wanted to for fun and posterity sake.    But George Lucas' attitude concerning his failure to treat the original trilogy with the respect it deserves by listening to the fans (the people who made him rich), has finally made me understand one thing: GEORGE DOESN'T CARE WHAT WE THINK. So in that tradition I don't care about these new Blu-ray releases. Seriously, I'm not that desperate.        You owe the fans an apology....and not in the form of a shoddy half-baked Blu-ray someday. A REAL Blu-ray release of the original trilogy complete with a remastered anamorphic widescreen image and sound.    I'm done with you George. Pick somebody else's pocket for a change.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Not sure why people down the developer because it's not working on their phone. if they didn't care about porting it over you wouldn't get it at all. never mind it being the FAotD, which people also review wrong because they have no patience to wait for the list to update and switch it free.  rate based on the play, the controls, or if it crashes all the time. you can also contact the developer and inform them of the bug, so that maybe it can be fixed.. whining about it in a review helps no one.  I love the game, plays fine and saves without a problem on my EVO 4G. I have this for the PC, and plays just like it!!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I think everybody knows what Plants vs zombies is, it a good time waster, reasonably fun and girls like it too.    There are problems with the android version though. at startup on low memory devises is has a pretty good chance of crashing due to poor memory management. These devices are capable to playing the game with only a few slight alterations I do not know why pop cap dose not both that make these changes. On 512mb ram devices you are gonna have some crashes but you can get it working. less than that and your gonna have a hard time getting the game too run, anything with a gb and up will be fine so keep that in mind.

B005HG4C4C|3.0|I can't bring myself to like it or dislike it. It's just an album, nothing special. I was really hoping that with the departure of Portnoy micromanagement that the remaining four members would be free to create a really stellar album. Instead, it's the same formula as Train of Thought and Octavarium; good bye Progressive Rock, hello Contemporary Christian. I don't have an issue with the musical direction it seems that DT has taken. I do take issue with the uninspired and bland content of the album.  ____    Petrucci's guitar are blaring the whole time and drown everything else out. Some of his timings and meter are crazy complicated and are cool to listen too. It just seems that, if LaBrie didn't sing at all, I would have guess that this was Petrucci's second solo album.    LaBrie vocals are good. He's holding his own as best as anyone with a vocal cord injury and hitting high notes for the past 20 some-odd years can do. Can he still hit the high notes from Images and Words and Awake? Certainly not, but he still has solid control over his voice and recognizes what he is capable of.     You get a hint of Myung, who really deserves a bigger part in the grand scheme of things. He's an incredible musician and think he has been forced into the back seat long enough.    Rudess is more subdued in the album, and at least (like with Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds and Silver Linings), he doesn't completely ruin a song with his disharmonious and random \\"squibbles\\" and \\"boops\\" he seems so fond of.    Mangini totally got shafted. All you hear from him is a bit of snare, bland kick drums, a slew of cymbals and no fills on the toms. After reading that the songs were already written, and they basically said \\"here's your drum tracks. Play this, and you can embellish what you like.\\" That's like with Henry Ford and the Model T, \\"You can have it in any color, so long as it's black.\\" There's no opportunity for Mangini to add his personal creativity or personality to the album. And something new and fresh is what DT needs right now. I'm disappointed that they didn't capitalize on the addition of Mangini.  ______    On the Backs of Angels - The song is alright. I listened to the prerelease on youtube from a link on their website and wasn't particularly impressed nor did I just outright dislike it. It has a good lead in, and builds the progression, but there really isn't a climax to it. It's an unremarkable song. Not good, not bad.    Build me up, break me down - Probably my favorite track of the album. Has some great, heavy riffs and the chorus flows well with the rest of the verse.    Lost not forgotten - Some nice keywork by Rudess at the beginning. I really like the verse on this track, but the chorus is so contrasting in rhythm it breaks the harmony of the rest of the song. This track reminds me of so many others on DT last few albums. I really like parts of the song, and dislike other parts of it. Rarely liking the whole song.    This is the life - A decent ballad actually. Some of the word choices don't flow well when LaBrie holds them, however. Rudess, Petrucci and Mangini work well together on this track....where's Myung?    Bridges in the sky - This track sounds like they took samples from seven different songs from four different albums and spliced them together. It's a hodgepodge of different harmonies and rhythms and one cluttered mess of a song.  Outcry - This one is similar to Bridges in the Sky. There is so much going on and so much varying of the harmonies that it sounds like a big mishmash of sound ....the last two and a half minutes of the track are decent though.    Far from heaven - Another ballade with Rudess and LaBrie performing a duet. It's more of a filler track on the album like On the Backs of Angels. Nothing special about it.    Breaking all Illusions - Another rollercoaster with bits of speed and heavy riffs mixed with slow moments all mingling together. I can remember the days of Learning to Live, A Change of Seasonsand This Dying Soul when the bridges and change-ups all worked together and made for one complete song. Can't find that on this one.    Beneath the Surface - The last track and ballade on the album. Not a bad song, not a great one. Like many other of the tracks on the album, there's nothing about it that makes me want to listen to it over and over.   ____    I've listened to A Dramatic Turn of Events several times, and as much as I want to, I can't get any sort of arousal out of it. I didn't hold the album up to a whole lot of expectations; I wasn't looking for an album as bone jarring as Awake, or explorative as Falling into Infinity or even as simple as Train of Thought. I wanted to see Dream Theater get out of the rut that has been their last few albums, and with A Dramatic Turn of Events, it ends up being lack luster and ultimately boring. This is just another album to take up another 1/4inch on my shelf and collect dust.    From all the readings on different websites and even looking at the composer and writer of the lyrics from previous albums and seeing Portnoy's name on everything, I figured without him, DT would have taken the opportunity and reinvent themselves. Upon hearing the album, nothing has changed. Maybe Portnoy's \\"micromanagement\\" wasn't really the problem.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Pretty fun game, and kind of addicting, in an &quot;Angry Birds&quot; kind of way.  Definitely worth it for free, but I would also pay the 99 cents for it.  Starts off very easy, but gets challenging pretty quickly.  Thanks for another way to waste a couple hours!

B000N193WW|5.0|About 6 years ago I inherited a copy of Kiss Double Platinum from my aunt. It, along with about 75 other records were stowed away in the attic of a house she has recently purchased. This album in particular caught my attention due to its shiny metallic sleeve, plus in the top right corner, there is a gold-ish stamp that states \\"LOANED FOR PROMOTION ONLY Not For Sale Ownership And All Rights Reserved.\\" Also, it still has the original Award and Kiss Army paper. Both records show only minor wear and have very little static, they don't skip at all. I have no clue what the value of this album is, I was hoping someone could help me out on this one.
0316017930|3.0|Outliers is a very interesting book. The idea is that success comes from doing many small things better rather than doing/having just one big thing better, like talent or IQ. Yes, talent and IQ are parts of the equation (Gladwell says that you only need a certain amount of each and then you get diminishing returns), but other things come into play too. Also important are hard work (Gladwell says that 10,000 hours is the threshold), timing (being born at the right time for the right industries helps), culture (Gladwell says that Asians may be better at math because of ancient cultural rice farming techniques), and luck, among others. Compelling examples include the Beatles, Bill Gates, Mozart, and 19th century Industrialists. All came along at the right time for their particular industries, had \\"enough\\" talent (although they were not necessarily the most gifted in this area), worked very hard, were in the right place at the right time (Gates had almost limitless access to very expensive computers in 1968), and were downright lucky.<br /><br />Although the stories and explanations in the book are fascinating, as I was reading I began to wonder what would have happened to these people if one or more of Gladwell's conditions were missing. Would the Beatles have simply been a small time bar band, disbanding after a few years for Lennon and McCartney to begin lifelong careers in the steel industry? Would Bill Gates have ended up repairing pinball machines for a living? I don't think so. Granted, certain specific things fell into place for them to end up where they did, but if things had happened differently I think they still would have risen to the top one way or another. They were smart enough, they worked hard, and if they wanted it bad enough, I think they would have made their way around whatever got in their way. These \\"Outliers\\" did not stumble upon success accidentally - they worked hard for it, and I feel they would have reached it one way or another despite missing one or more of Gladwell's criteria. Ultimately I think that this interpretation of Gladwell's book is very hopeful to many people. If you are smart enough and work harder than others, you can make your own way. Sure luck and being in the right place at the right time helps, but there is also such a thing as making your own luck.<br /><br />Outliers is subtitled \\"The Story of Success.\\" Maybe it should be titled \\"Stories of Success\\" instead, because although these may be (Gladwell's) ways to achieve success, they are certainly not the only ways.or more of Gladwell's criteria.

B003UESJHO|4.0|Great movie about two brothers growing up in Boston.  Both are boxers with lots of talent.  There are obstacles they both have to overcome.  First of all, one is addicted to drugs and that leads him to endless trouble.  The younger brother is insecure and easy to sway from people in his suroundings: his mother, brother, girlfriend, so called business managers.    I loved the fact that film shows working class family struggling to cash in on only thing they have - a talented boxer and his brother who acts as his coach.  Everyone is in it for the money, except perhaps Charlene, a girlfriend, college drop out and outcast from this working class town.  Charlene sees in her boyfriend a potential that should not go wasted and with fierce love she feels for him, she will do whatever it takes to protect his best interests even if it means setting up boundaries with his family.    Wonderful performances from the entire cast.  I truly enjoyed this movie.

1416596585|4.0|I bought this book automatically because I had previously read and enjoyed Levy's previous works: Insanely Great, Hackers and Chaos. Given his heritage covering technology companies and personalities as both an author and a journalist, I was curious what he would make of Google.<br /><br />The book is expansive and provides a lot of additional colour around Google, some of which I found of interest as I had worked at Yahoo! competing against Google and working with some of the early darlings of the web 2.0 movement - Flickr and Delicious. There were a couple of things that surprised me such as Google's use of machine learning on areas like translation explained why grammar is still so bad in this area as it needs heuristics that lexicographers could provide similar to that offered by Crystal Semantics.<br /><br />Overall it was interesting to see that as with most large organisations Google is not only fallible but run through with realpolitik and a fair bit of serendipity. This contrasts with the external perception of Google as the technological &Uuml;bermensch. A classic example of this is the series of missteps Google made whilst competing in China, which are documented in the book. From staffing practices, promotional tactics and legal to technology; Google blew it's chances and Baidu did a better job.<br /><br />As an aside it was interesting to note that Google used queries on rival search engines to try and work out how to comply with Chinese government regulations, which is eerily like bad practices that Google accused Bing of last February in `hiybbprqag'-gate.<br /><br />There is a curious myopia that runs through a lot of later Google product thinking that reminded me of the reality and perceptions that I was aware of existing inside Microsoft from the contact I have had with the organisation through the various different agencies I have worked at. A classic example of this is the Google view of a file-less future, which by implication assumes that people won't have legacy documents or use services other than the Google cloud. It is a myopia that comes part of arrogance and a patronising attitude towards the consumer that Google always knows best about every aspect of their needs.<br /><br />Contrast this with Apple and iTunes. Whilst Apple would like to sell you only content from the iTunes store, it recognises that you will have content from different sources: Amazon MP3s, ripped CDs, podcasts and self-created files that iTunes needs to play nicely with.<br /><br />The `no files' approach assumes ubiquitous bandwidth which is likely to be a fiction for a while. (Part of the reason why I am able to write this post is that I was stuck for half-a-day on a train journey to Wales enjoying patchy mobile phone coverage and a wi-fi free environment, which allowed me to focus on reading this book in hardback).  This approach smacks of the old data lock-in that Microsoft used to have with proprietary file formats for its Office documents.<br /><br />Levy does a good job pulling all of this together and chronicling Google, but he fails to cast a critical eye over it all. I suspect that this is because he is too close to the company: the access that he gained enveloped him. Which is a shame as all the experience and insight Levy could bring to the book that would add value to the reader is omitted.

B0009P5YXO|3.0|While buying the Tardis USB 4-port router and die-cast Golden Dalek action toy (two EXCELLENT bargains and worth the money), I decided to make it three items when I saw the add for this \\"toy\\" on Amazon. Always wanted a replica of the sonic screwdriver. I read the negative reviews but decided I could live with the product's obvious drawbacks. When it arrived and I opened the package, I knew I should have saved my money, but I was only mildly disappointed: after all, I'm a serious Dr. Who fanatic. However, I feel that I was somewhat taken advantage of by the manufacturers of this VERY INSUBSTANTIAL AND FLIMSY replica.    Pros: It does, in fact, look a lot like the Doctor's sonic screwdriver. Color, shape, and size are all correct. Also, you get a spare ink-pen nib. You'll probably NOT want to use this as an ink pen: the ink is disappearing ink visible only when you shine the UV light of the screwdriver on it. Also, the whole nib assembly falls off when you apply even light pressure while writing your secret messages.    Cons: The construction is VERY flimsy and fragile. It's made of 100-percent low-impact plastic like the model airplanes you glue together and never play with because they'll break so easily. Requires three button batteries (included, but possibly weak from sitting on the shelf too long) and VERY CAREFUL assembly. Read the instructions, don't force any parts to fit into each other, and be careful not to lose the screw when you remove the hatch for access to the battery housing. You'll need a tiny Phillips-head screwdriver and a steady hand to insert/change the batteries. When you insert them, be sure to get their polarities right! Even with fresh batteries, the two audio effects are barely loud enough to pick up with the human ear! The ink pen nib and plastic slider button detach (sorry... fall off!) very easily and will be the first things you'll lose.     This \\"toy\\" is NOT FOR VERY YOUNG KIDS; it'll be broken and small parts swallowed in seconds, guaranteed! In fact it's not for any kind of play or constant handling; it's too fragile to bring with you when you go to the next SCIFICON dressed as The Doctor or River Song.    In summary, this \\"toy\\" is not for constant use by human hands (of ANY age); it's a handsome but fragile replica to be admired and handled only very gingerly. I still like it, with all its faults. However, if you're looking for a sonic screwdriver for serious role-playing and rough treatment, build your own out of metal... just like the Doctor did!

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was a sophomore in college when the first movie came out....and I've owned SW on every format except laser disc and HD-DVD (or whatever that format was called). Now I have it on Blu-ray and I'm pleased.  I expect this to be the last SW set I ever buy too.  I will keep my DVD sets with the original movies, but I must say I'm not bothered at all by the changes Lucas made.  Most of them are like a welcome surprise.  I will say that I still have to watch ROTJ to see the famous \\"NOOOOOOOOO\\" scene and if I hate it I'll lower my rating.  I should know after tonight. But so far, I'm good with this set.    BTW, the movies look & sound great.  High def really serves to great benefit when playing these files on a large screen TV.  If you have kids (not really young ones, though), they will enjoy this!  Movie night is clearly a winner with this set.  Well worth the $80.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I have to say that I feel old seeing a board game based on a video game. It's fun. My son loved it. We used it as a cake topper at his angry birds themed birthday party.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Neat little idea and tricky AI. Sometimes you have to misdirect and cut off the spider(s), and other times you have to cut off paths to your bugs or alternate ways of them attacking 2 bugs at once.  Very challenging.  Some spots of the interface reminds me a lot of Angry Birds.  Well put together and catchy little songs.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|Okay, I'm not going to review all six movies based on their content.  I'm just going to do transfers and new special features.  To start I actually like all six Star Wars films.  Sure, I could nitpick all of the prequels and Jedi all day, but I still like them.  My least favorite films in this series end up being Jedi and Phantom Menace.  But onto the actual product.....<br /><br />As far as transfers alone this set deserves FIVE STARS.  These movies have never looked better.  Really.  It's unreal.  Of course the prequels, being shot digitally, look the best, but the original trilogy looks only a spec less.  The sound is the best I've ever heard on blu ray honestly.  You can hear star ships zoom by your head on either side for all six films.  Clone Wars' scene between Obi Wan and Jengo in the astroid field works the best.  Ben Burt's sound design really shines here.  The only negative I can think of with the new Hi-Def transfers for the original trilogy I can muster is that some of the cut and paste comp works in outer space involving the space ships are more obvious.  YOu can see the matte lines around the flying ships.  I remember seeing this on the original VHS's I owned as a child, but I didn't notice them when watching these films on the last dvd release.  If back in 1997 Lucas went to all the trouble of making the comp lines in the Hoth battle in Empire less transluscent than why not touch that up too?  Your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />At this point everyone, EVERYONE, knows that Lucas tweaks and adds to his original trilogy and even the prequels(remember the added scene in Phantom Menace on Coruscant, and the added sound effects in the stadium duel in Clone Wars?), and this release is no different.  There are less tweaks here, but they are there.  Firstly, on Episode IV we get a new sound effect replacing Obi Wan's original dragon call on tatooine.  It's more shrill and scary.  It adds to the scene, but defintely doesn't detract from the original premise.  Necessary?  Nope.  Distracting?  Not really, unless you need to get a life, of course.  Episode V only had one noticeable change and that was replacing the original actor who voiced Boba Fett with actor Tumuera Morrison who played his father Jengo Fett in Episode II, and played ALL the clones in the prequel trilogy.  Episode VI has only one change as well that I noticed, additional dialogue for Darth Vader when he kills the Emperor.  He gets a line of \\"No\\" and a redub reflecting his big \\"Nooooooo\\", at the end of Revenge of the Sith.  Really unnecessary, but not a deal breaker.  I didn't find the moment in Sith funny, but rather nostalgic for the old Universal Frankenstein films, so this doesn't bring up bad memories or really bother me.  But at the end of the day it is totally unnecessary and really unwarranted.<br /><br />The prequels, as far as I could tell, were totally untouched with the exception of Phantom Menace.  They replaced the awkward puppet used in this prequel and replaced him with a digital version that fits more with the next two prequel's Yoda.  This I don't mind.  I never liked the Yoda puppet in Phantom Menace, it looked worse than the one used in Empire and Jedi.  The puppetry by Frank Oz was great as always but the look was all wrong down from material for skin to the lighting.  He looked like a cheesy puppet, which the original trilogy's Yoda really truly didn't.  Honestly, this brings another factor to my attention.  If Lucas is going over and trying to 'perfect' all these movies than when is he going to get around to digitizing Yoda in Empire and Jedi?  Or when is he going to add articulation to the Ewoks?  What about Episode IV's Chewbacca?  Chewy looks the weakest in that entry, especially in blu ray.  YOu can actually see the lines in the mask around the eyes more often than the later films. I'm not saying I do or don't want this, but when is it going to happen?  Spielberg animated E.T.'s face for his special edition of E.T., so whynot Yoda in Empire?  We'll see....<br /><br />Okay, and now onto the three special features discs.  This is my major complaint regarding this set and this is why I didn't give it a full five stars which it deserved.  None, and I mean NONE, of the special features produced for the original Prequel releases, and the first release of the original trilogy are here on any of the three special features discs.  So, I have to keep the fourth disc from the original trilogy release, which has the wonderful almost all encompassing Empire of Dreams doc, and the prequel trilogy had great finished deleted scenes.  Especially the doc for Phantom Menace which had a doc regarding the making of that film and it was very intersting and entertaining.<br /><br />Okay, disc seven of the bonus material is all about the prequel trilogy.  It's sparse as far as running time goes, but adds up when you break down the interactive material which consists of concept art, stroyboards, animatics, and turn table vies of vehicles and characters.  Cool stuff, but I garuntee you'll only watch it once.  The interviews are cool but mostly filler when it comes to the actors, but all the technical guys, and Lucas himself is very good, and you can't find it anywhere in previous prequel release.  We get some more deleted scenes too, but they're not 'finished' like the ones released with the dvds.  They are rough and have temp animation.  Most of these are not that interesting, not because of quality, but because they add up to little more than ancilary bits and extensions of scenes.  Nothing important here.<br /><br />Disc 8, is the same as disc 7 but this time regarding the original trilogy.  The interviews have more depth, but they seem like take outs, or extensions removed from the excellent Empire of Dreams dvd.  Seeing the concept art here is wonderful due to the fact that they are so old.  It's great to have this stuff on file finally, but the real meat of the original trilogy comes into play with disc 9.<br /><br />Disc 9 has a great archival collection of features released back in the 70's and 80's and as recent as 2010!  The Making of Star Wars(back when it was simply called Star Wars) is wonderful, if slightly more truncating and missing retrospect when compared to Empire of Dreams, runs about 49 minutes and covers all the prodution details but, for obvious reasons, doesn't go into the hardships taken on by Lucas.  Empire Strikes Back: SPFX runs 48 minutes and basically just sticks with the visual effects aspect of this film.  While, again, missing intimate details regarding the production and behind the scenes stuff you sure get to know how that film's ingenious visuals were realized.  Classic Creatures: Return of the Jed runs 48 minutes and is my favorite of the original film's vintage docs.  It just fouces on the practical creatures and puppetry heavily employed for this sequel.  I don't know why but I still get a kick out of men and women building, operating and deseigning practical creature effects.  Repeat info regarding Jabba's creation comes from Empire of Dreams but it doesn't do that in other areas, and it's hosted by Carrie Fisher and Billy Dee Williams.  Anatomy of a Dewback is a 26 minute doc I remember watching back when the original films were being re-released in their special edition form back in 1997.  It basically painstakingly goes over the restoration of the original trilogy, and the scene that was added with the Storm Troopers riding the dewbacks in the desert.  Lucas gives his reasons, regarding asthetic and storytelling for this addition.  This is the only new secene covered in this doc, but it is really fun.  Star Warriors is a feature length doc running 84 minutes about a Star Wars club that has 'movie authentic' costumes that they do free charity work in.  It's about their trek to getting a march in a big Rose Bowl parade.  YAAAAAAAAAAWN.  Star Wars Tech is a 46 minute doc straight from TV regarding Star Wars technology and how fact based it is, and how possible it is to become true, and how much of it actually DID come true.  Very cool.  A Conversation with the Masters: The Empire Strikes Back 30 Years later is a 2010 doc only running 25 minutes but has new interviews with Lucas, director Irvin Kershner and screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan reagarding the most loved of the original trilogy.  Very neat, especially hearing from Kasdan, but it mostly repeats ino discussed in Empire of Dreams.<br /><br />Finally, the last new special feature is a 97 minute compilation of various Star Wars references and parodies from over the years in movies and TV.  We get clips from Robot Chicken and Family Guy(of course!), but we also get clips from Clerks, Fanboys, The Donnie and Marie Show, many various seasons of Saturday Night Live(fav being the lost audition tapes for A New Hope starring Kevin Spacey doing dead on and hysterical impressions of Christopher Walken and Jack Lemon), How I Met Your Mother, and many others.  Funny enough, but you can find these clips easily on the net, and honestly this, and the Star Warriors, feature I would easily trade in for a Hi-Def version of Empire of Dreams and ALL the prequel DVD's special features.<br /><br />The one retained special feature from the dvd's is all six films' commentary tracks, which are great!!!  The best info you'll get about the films.  There is a new commentary track added to each film which mixes the original commentaries with archive interviews with various producers, FX guys, and the actors.  I've only listened to Sith for this, and it's good, but I would rather have had the interviews seperated.  Also, some of the snippets on this commentary are repeats from the interviews presented in the special features discs.<br /><br />So, there you have it.  It's a mixed bag.  If you're an uber fan, but not a total dweeb, like me you'll want to hold onto your bonus discs from the previous releases unfortunately.  I'm sure we'll being seeing more Star Wars on blu ray in my lifetime, probably three times more.  The transfers and sound make it worth and some of the special features.  Really, the real question comes down to this: why have the orginal bonus materials not been included on the very roomy blu ray discs, especially when there are 9 discs?  And, of course, WHERE THE HELL ARE THE REMASTERED HI-DEF COPIES OF THE UNALTERED ORIGINAL TRILOGY?????  It baffles me with sooooo many fanboys asking for this that Lucas still hasn't given it.  Why?  At least for posterities sake this should happen.  I'm sure it will one day.......<br /><br />PS: If anyone out there knows of any alterations to these films that I missed, please let me know in the comments section.f features released back in the 70's and 80's and as recent as 2010!

0765350386|5.0|This was such a good book. It was original and captivating. The author did a great job creating a world and believable characters. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it. Kudos for a job well done. Thanks.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|Woody Allen has more misses than hits but when he does it right it is very often a classic.  Our son now lives in Paris so we visit quite often and to see all the sights in addition to the artistic allure of Paris was quite a treat for us.  We don't know whether Owen Wilson was consciously portraying Woody Allen himself or the main character was patterned after Allen.  In any case, his portrayal was dead-on.  The cameo roles were very good and above all, the plot was great story-telling.  A very enjoyable movie which we will see again.  Pat & Jean Renaud

B00007G1ZC|4.0|I love the personal touches that are given to `Dreams', a film inspired by the actual dreams of the film's director, Akira Kurosawa.  Kurosawa made some astonishing films, and `Dreams' may be his most visually impactful.  It is, essentially, eight short films strung together through similar themes.  From the first short film (my favorite in some ways) to the final, stunning (visually and emotionally) punch to the heart, Kurosawa understands that these short films tell a tale that is important to hear and absorb.  As a whole, the collection works very nicely.  In parts, some stories work better than others and a few can feel stretched beyond necessity.  Maintaining an ethereal atmosphere (thus, the dream reference) throughout the entire film, `Dreams' truly lives up to its name.  From the epic depictions of fog layered hill tops (in `The Weeping Demon') to colorful adaptations of famous paintings (in the visual feast, `Crows'), `Dreams' will keep you glued to every frame; but it's the profound statement being made by the core of these dreams that will keep you thinking about it time and time again.  Delving into themes that concern death, loss, guilt and the separation of man and nature, Kurosawa has created something unforgettable.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|Fun and casual game that i grabbed. It's a lot fun and I enjoyed the animations. Definitely check it out!
B004EPZ070|3.0|[[ASIN:B004EPZ070 Something Borrowed]]Like most of today's movies, just okay. A cute premise, that was a solid 3 stars. Perhaps a bit too long.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Like Angry Birds, the idea is to finish in as few moves as possible. It's a fun little time waster, and I found the solution was not always immediately apparent, which I appreciate.

055357342X|1.0|Summary: don't buy it, don't read it, don't waste your time, author loses his grip BIG time on the plot by the middle of book 3.<br /><br />I picked up Martin's Game of Thrones series because of a story on NPR about the new HBO tv series.  Warning: generic spoilers (nothing specific) necessary to say why these books suck.  I found book 1 to be a page turner and a little dark.  But generally, I enjoyed the plot, the buildup, and the characters.  His style of each chapter being from a different character's perspective was initially very interesting; what an opportunity to see a story from so many perspectives.  In part, this device works because the plot is relatively tight in terms of time and space in the first book.  However, book two gets a bit more muddy.  The many character perspective approach starts to unravel the tight plot of the first book.  Time as a plot element is largely ignored by the author as we bounce from perspective to perspective across continents with little to no sense of time.  Important 'physics' related plot devices are created without any meaningful system around them to provide consistency or a sense of reality.  In short, book two was ok, not great, but started to get clumsy.  It wanders a long ways from the tight family story of book one and gets a little lost in its own plot complications.  However, I continued on with book three, hoping to see the resolution and advancement of some plot lines, perhaps a tightening of the tale into something epic.<br /><br />Sadly, book three takes a literary turn for the worse.  The author, having created a confusing mess in book two that required creative and detail-oriented resolution, decides to 'cut' his way out of the problem.  Don't know what to do with that character?  Kill them.  The other character?  Them too.  Just introduced this interesting character? Kill them too!  Not sure how to dramatically wrap up this plot?  Cheesy timing!  He probably could have just wrapped up the first three booksby killing a couple more characters and starting over.<br /><br />Really, this book is terrible.  Pick something else.  I now have two more friends, both intelligent fantasy novel lovers, who called it quits in book 3 because they just couldn't keep subjecting themselves to the author's cynical and whimsical approach to plot.<br /><br />Vote here via comment if you gave up on this series or book.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|One of the best film ever made. The photography is magnificent..The screenplay is refreshing. The director wonderful and the actors incredible..
0452289963|5.0|I have read hundred of books in the self help, spirituality, psychology, and metaphysical genres, and once in a while a book comes along that reminds me why it is I invest so much time in reading all these books; A New Earth was one of those books. No, I did not get the overnight Aha! moment I always hope to find, the moment when I finally get \\"it\\" and my life magically falls into place, but this book provided me lots and lots of little, quieter Aha moments, that while maybe as not as flashy as the big one I am always hoping for, they have become lasting parts of me. Eckhart teaches in a gentle way that makes abstract things feel concrete, meaning, I read these spiritual books and everything they are saying makes sense, but at the end of the book I am still no closer to knowing exactly how to do these things and apply them to my life, but Tolle teaches in a way that I can actually walk away and start applying these beautiful teachings and practices immediately, which is why I think they have stuck with me. It's an amazing book for someone who's just starting their journey and also for someone who has been on the road a little longer. Eckhart takes you inside, tries to walk you straight into the awareness, and that my friends, is where the change really is.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Greedy Spiders is a fairly challenging game especially to get three stars. I rate it 5 stars for its challenge factor and compatibility with my phone the HTC Incredible 2. Gpraphics are pretty good too.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was not going to purchase this new blu-ray set based on the other Amazon reviews I've read and the fact that I was reticent in spending more $$$ because I have purchased all previous versions of this series and felt that I did not want to buy everything but again. However, there were others that reviewed this set AFTER they purchased this set which lead me decide to purchase this set and I AM GLAD I DID.    I have been an avid fan of all of these films since the FIRST, first movie was released. The \\"issues\\" brought up by previous reviewers were not \\"issues\\" at all, but tweeks to add to the film's watchability. Although these tweeks are noticeable (But only if you have seen each film multiple times, multiplied by a gazillion), I feel that these tweeks do not detract from the film and do not ruin the foundation of the storyline.    I believe there are fanANTICS that will complain for the sake of complaining. I believe instead, people should be thankful that there are those who wish to make and create the best movie experience possible and it seems the team at Lucasfilm are just that sort.    If you are on the fence about purchasing this blu-ray issue of these epic films, I assert that this set will be an excellent addition to your movie (specially Star Wars) collection.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I'm a die hard fan but this book reminded me too much of the movie \\"Enough\\" with Jennifer Lopez. Sorry :(
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a great game. It's a fun strategy game. It's a good challenge and it's beautiful looking game. Definitely worth to download.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Those who live in the past, also probably use outhouses, populated with Sears catolgues for wiping material!<br />Time has passed, technologies have improved and Lucas is now able to render the films closer to what he invisioned orginally, but was thwarted due to the lack of technolgy at the time. As all things,when we go back, we always make them better due to us knowing more, and/or having more expertice available and now seeing things clearer and better.<br />So for those who remain in the past, the outhouse can be either a cold, or hot place. Me, I prefer modern indoor plumbing. That's the way these new films are - an upgrade! Gone are the boring Originals, replaced by more modern, cleaner, bolder and more energenic versions! Sorry for those who dwell in the past, but for all others, 6 excellent Blu-ray films await your pleasure, and for only $79 at current prices. Get out there and buy this great set, and enjoy your HD system to it's fullest! May the Viewing Force be with You!
B000S56R1I|5.0|Sufjan Stevens is one of the most treasured musical story tellers of our time.  Illinoise is the album that culminates this ability with a broad range of stylistic elements.  If you've found yourself put off by christian or near christian artists, you have not spent time with Sufjan Stevens or specifically with this album.  Your mind will definitely be changed as to what defines christian rock, it isn't standard.  I personally would not consider him christian, and would lump him more with indie vocal artists with christian undertones.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|Just a bit silly at times and you'll likely have to watch it more then once....But , all in all I enjoyed it. some times too much detail and background history, and other times you wonder whats going on.     I like the old \\"graphic novels\\" and movies that are made from them , like Sin City. While this one is not as good in my opinion as Sin City, its still entertaining and well worth the 3 hours to watch.     A bit gory and violent so not really sutible for young ones, but if your looking for something a little different... Enjoy.

B0052WSX32|2.0|I'm a great fan of nostalgia. Always have been, even when the things I'm nostalgic about were new. So when I read about this \\"new\\" album by Doris Day, I was enthralled and pre-ordered it through Amazon. I've listened to it twice now. My first eye-opener was when I discovered that this album is hardly \\"new\\" in the sense of recently recorded. I gathered from pre-release articles I'd read that she'd come out of retirement and decided to do a new album, critics-be-darned. Little did I suspect how old most of the tracks are...like 30 years or so. (There's conveniently no recording date information included in the liner notes.) Most of the \\"contemporary\\" songs are trite and banal...yawn-inducing. Perhaps in the hands of a more charismatic singer, they could be pulled off, but it's doubtful. In Doris's hear-my-purity voice, they fall incredibly flat. They're the ones where her pristine voice is surrounded by \\"contemporary\\" sounds. She just sings them as if they were good songs. Then there's the one son Terry wrote for her but she insisted he sing himself. Mama, not all record producers or sons are cut out to be singers! She has a spoken intro to this one, and judging by the quavering 87yo voice, it's probably a good thing she didn't try to record a \\"new\\" album. Some singers whose voices have gone with age cover it by acting chops. (Frank Sinatra's final rendition of \\"One for My Baby\\" on the DUETS album is a case in point.) Doris is definitely a throw-back to an earlier era, and to me, there's nothing wrong with that. Purity and cleanliness are virtues. But the lack of substance is not particularly entertaining. I had high hopes for this album when I read about it. Too bad.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I've always considered the short, or maybe the not that long, writings of Stephen King as his best. No matter how much I enjoy his novels some of them I find kind of heavy, if you understand what I mean. But of course that doesn't apply here since Mile 81 is nothing more than a big short story.<br />  It all begins one fine day when ten year old Pete Simmons decides to live a big adventure. So he runs away from home heading for the deserted rest area at Mile 81 on a highway in Maine. Pete is a very impressionable kid that imagines himself as an adventurer and an explorer, so he sets off to discover the dark secrets hidden in the abandoned fast-food restaurant that's situated there. The most exciting thing he comes up with though is a half-finished bottle of vodka and being the big boy that he is he decides to take a sip, and another, and another. As one would expect he gets drunk soon enough and since he doesn't want to go back home like that he thinks it best to sleep it off. Thus he doesn't realize that right outside very strange things are happening. First there comes a mud-covered station wagon, even though there hasn't been any rain in the area for ages. The driver door opens, but inside there's nobody to be seen. Right behind it arrives to park an insurance guy and part-time preacher who wants to be a Good Samaritan and soon enough a cowgirl, with her horse and everything, and a family follow suit. And poor Pete is still asleep. Well, evil lurks and it's maybe up to him to save the day; and if he's lucky enough he may even live to tell (especially to his know-it-all brother) the story of an adventure unlike any other. Will he manage to do that and how? Let's not forget that he's no more than a little boy.<br />  Mile 81 is a finely-crafted story which will surely offer some reading pleasure to the fans of the good author. At the end of it one can also read an excerpt from 11.22.63., King's next novel, where a man travels back in time in order to intervene and save the life of JFK. That sure sounds interesting.ve the life of JFK. That sure sounds interesting.

B004V98UKS|5.0|nice game, simple controls, works well on my htc evo. good time waster. can't comment on sound, as I always leave those off. doesn't need a ton of permissions which should make those people who worry happy :)
B00009AOBI|5.0|I love this site.. I had looked for this movie for a few years..This guy has so many of the old and hard to find ones.. they arrive quickly and they are New DVDs.. Great deal.. will shop here again..     KJ
0307272702|2.0|Don't ask me how, a person with high school and a couple college credits under my belt, but I whipped though the 8,000 page Good Calories, Bad Calories fast as can be and couldn't put it down until I finished it.  It was brilliant excellent reading, sure some pages I had to read five times but still, good read.<br /><br />So I thought WWGF was supposed to the fun readable diet book.  Put me to sleep more than once.  Not impressed at all with this.<br /><br />Gary, write another one that's really for lay people, perhaps in cartoon format, ten pages should do the trick.  I mean really, people are busy you know.<br /><br />¢¾

B003YL4LYI|5.0|The only thing I can say about this installment is I can't wait for the next one.  Watched the GOT episode 1 on HBO and immediately downloaded it.  Then over over the next several weeks read through the whole series.  Breathtaking, twist, turns, and betrayal everywhere.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Got it for free...low expectations, but it's actually a really well-done little game. Some levels quite challenging!  Try it! Now!
1595141715|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I love the storyline. After longing for the fact that he had nothing to do with the death, the narrator goes on into the \\"tapes\\" he realizes the unknown. This book is cleverly written. I felt as if I were able to relate with Hannah. I wanted to tell her to hold out for the future. Very compelling, a MUST READ!
B0055S348W|5.0|Not a big review creator but this app deserves it.  very usable and easy to figure out. works well on all 3 of my Androids. galaxy tab and galaxy s and HTC merge.
B0013USZHG|4.0|Since I'm latin I like this type of symphonic compositions.  The repertoire was too Venezuela biased but interpretations were quite good.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Got this after seeing all of the good reviews.  Music is great.  Puzzles are interesting.  Very relaxing game.  Glad that I listened to all of those reviews!
B004FJJGBG|5.0|Very cool effects--3D is great. Avatar is neat in 3D. I would recommend this movie to all with 3D TVs.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|1.  Thank you for waiting until you put together the best  album you could possibly produce.  I don't care that it took 8+ years.  It was worth the wait.    2.  Thank you for realizing that Joey Belladonna is the voice of Anthrax.  Period.  Nice to see those from the John Bush camp agreeing to this simple fact.    3.  Thank you for making me feel so giddy about an album (yes, giddy) that upon hearing it in its entirety, I felt an immediate urge to call/text/email/facebook every one of my metalhead friends and ask them, \\"did you get this yet?!  It's amazing!\\"  I honestly can't remember the last time I felt that way about an entire album.    4.  Thank you for also reminding me what it felt like to be 16 again, hanging outside my high-school in Brooklyn with all the long-haired guys congregating around my boyfriend's old  Chevy Nova, which was most likely cranking out \\"Fistful of Metal\\" or \\"Ride the Lightening.\\"    5.  Thank you for Track #7.  Epic doesn't begin to describe it.  Arguably the best song you ever wrote.    6.  Lastly, thank you for going out on tour so soon to support this record.  Tickets have been ordered.  Usually, fans prefer that a band play the older stuff since we don't know the new stuff yet.  You can play this album in its entirety.  As other reviewers have noted, it's JUST.  THAT.  GOOD.
0345528581|5.0|The best fitness book I've ever bought. I had my doubts about this book because I thought that I'd have to put in at least 1 hour five days a week to build muscle and ingest ungodly amounts of sports supplements. Because of that, I wasted most of my money on unnecessary supplements and spent two hours in the gym almost every day. I started to hate working out and my grades in college went down because I didn't have enough time to study. This book has saved my grades, time, and sanity. Here's why:    The workouts last anywhere from 12-30 minutes  He makes valid points about nutrition and that sports supplements aren't a must  You save money on a useless gym membership  The routines constantly change and give good results, preventing boredom  The book is fun to read and actually humorous at times  He encourages you to rest  Anyone can do it (my 60 year-old father and 90 year-old grandfather bought a copy)  The exercises are much more functional than weight lifting  This book helps you get ALL components of fitness    The only issue for some people is the willingness to push yourself, but, believe me, it's well worth it. My confidence level has significantly increased because I know that I have the mental capacity to push myself to the limit. I feel amazing after every workout.    If you're interested in Martial Arts, the book will help you. His book has helped me work into some of the exercises like one-legged squats that I have to do for Bagua, which I thought would take me years to accomplish. \\"The rapid results method\\" on the front of the book is no lie, and you will be everything but disappointed.
0321647440|4.0|This is a good textbook for a difficult and complex subject.  If you are taking a class, and I advise that you do, if you just hang in there it finally comes together.    Aperture is a good program at the professional level so worth the effort.    Good illustrations and directions.  Could be more basic in the beginning for less experienced people.  Just plough through and get all the help available in the Apple Centers.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|Beautiful cd, I love every last song on it, made me proud that it wasnt a waste of my time and money :)
0201633612|4.0|This is a seminal reference book on Object Oriented Programming.  While it is a bit old, the patterns put forward in this text have become widely accepted in the industry and any developer working with OOP should make themselves familiar with them both to write better code and to understand the conventions in the code that other write.
055357342X|5.0|Oh I am so loving this series. Not excited about how long it takes to get a new book out, but I'll have to hope to live that long!<br /><br />Series can often die off and each one coast but I LOVE how new characters are deftly introduced, current characters are even FURTHER developed, and story lines are nurtured and expanded and explored. I haven't gotten lost, I haven't gotten stuck, and most important, I haven't gotten bored.<br /><br />I have, however, gotten a bruise in the crook of my arm from holding the book and staying up way too late reading. The alarm clock is brutal these days.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this series. I'm trying to pace myself, KNOWING how many years I'll have to wait for the final books (only one more to read after this one!) but Martin makes it too easy to devour this stuff.
B000066C1N|4.0|My 5 yr old daughter and I love the movie, so I bought the CD to play in the car.  We love the soundtrack.  This CD was labeled \\"Used-Very Good\\", but one of the songs wouldn't play.  There was a local used video store that buffs out discs for a dollar, so I took it to them.  They were able to buff it enough to play, but I shouldn't have had to do that on a \\"Very Good\\" CD.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|No, this doesn't have the original theatrical releases you remember as a kid.  Yes, Lucas has added some more \\"tweaks\\" and fixes.  The fact remains, it's still STAR WARS!  The picture looks the best it ever has, and the sound is outstanding.  This is a great set, and it's a great price.  It's packaged well, doesn't take up too much space.  If you are a Star Wars fan, you owe it to yourself to see the movies in stunning hi-def.  It's a beautiful feast for the eyes, and the ears.  John Williams score hasn't sounded this clean since the original movies came out the first time, or if you were lucky enough to see Star Wars in concert and hear it live, this is as close as you can get.  You will still enjoy it, and so will your kids.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

0143038419|5.0|This book helped me to get a better relationship with God.  It also assisted me in finding someone to help me learn to chant, and clear my mind of unnecessary thoughts that were overwhelming me during my daily walk with God.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The audio is great. I had it turned up quite a bit. The audio is half of the entire experience and it delivers. I added another speaker for the 6.1 experience. The video quality progressively gets better and better when starting with A New Hope. After every movie, my jaw gets lower and lower. It is that damn good.     To take advantage of the blu-ray tech, i hope people are viewing these discs on the right hardware. 1080p 120hz tv, blu-ray player set to 24hz, 1080p and going through at least a 5.1 surround sound receiver (with hdmi in and out) that is capable of DTS-HD Master Audio with the proper number of speakers and sub....hdmi cables all the way around.    Solution to Darth Vader's \\"NOOOOOOO\\" in Return of The Jedi : put your hands over your ears for those 2 seconds.    My theory on the different color of Luke's lightsaber in the Millenium Falcon is that it might of been in training mode (reduced power)    The ewoks eyelids are now cgi...big effin deal. are you that petty? i mean really.    Some complain that George put Hayden's ghost force image at the end of Return of The Jedi....my take on that was to keep continuity. Instead of an older man next to Ben and Yoda, maybe George thought people would recognize or relate to Anakin's image better. it was a young anakin that was turned to the dark side, not an older man.    changing Boba Fett's voice to Temuera Morrison's....once again...to keep continuity    I guess there are a couple of other issues people have, but from the sound of it, i can overlook these little nuances.        i wonder how many people have given it a 1 star without even buying and watching? and how can you review it before the september 16th release? you're just being presumptious and taking the word of other websites.
B005LY4B0A|2.0|The gameplay, graphics, sound effects and music are good. But the spider doesn't always follow the same path, even if you do exactly the same thing. This gets incredibly frustrating as you try to decide which move to make.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|The first movie I saw by Mamoru Hosoda was 'The Girl Who Leapt Through Time' When I had seen the trailer and poster I didn't think I would Like it because I am a big Hayao Miyazaki fan and I did't expect to like any anime other than his (I don't like manga's and tend to not like many anime). But after seeing it I loved it (it's a must have. So after having seen it I was very excited to hear that 'Summer Wars' was coming out.  I loved this movie. Although I preferred Mamoru Hosoda's first movie this one was still beautiful with an interesting story and from my point of view the dubbing was good (I tend not to mind dubbing).  So if you are an anime or Hayao Miyazaki lover...BUY THIS!    For 'The Girl Who Leapt Through Time':  [...]
B005LY4B0A|5.0|fun puzzle game that has a similar format to angry birds. definitely a fun diversion for people that like puzzles.
B000BBOUCW|2.0|I was really excited about this as I grew up playing FF7 on the original PlayStation when it came out.  Unfortunately like a lot of Anime this suffers from a complete separation from the game besides character names.  The art was ok but I expected better, and the story is disjointed and doesn't make a lot of sense, and the characters are rather undefined.  I've spent my life playing FF games so I expect the disjointedness between FF games but this was billed as FF VII so I expected it to tie in a lot better instead I felt completely let down by this.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Great game with multiple endings but the charecters can talk forever. I got the true ending and the end sequence (Just the dialog) was half and hour alone (I am not joking)Over all it was a very good game. Try an find the mummy.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Not the most exciting game in the world, but I got way more than a buck worth of entertainment out of it. Runs okay on lg optimus v and only takes up 1 meg after moving to sd card. Really worth a download if you want a puzzle game that is quick to pickup
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Im waiting on Plants vs. Zoombies pt2 to cone out.  I'm playing it through a second time and it still keeps up with my short attention span!
B0055S348W|5.0|I print quite a few documents from my phone.  Really surprised to see how well it worked with my brother wifi printer.  No glitches so far.
B004V98UKS|4.0|This is a Sokoban clone, but with two distinct differences: 1) spikes that appear, probably to increase your time, and 2) a penalty for restarting a level. There may be more, but I gave up. FUninstalled. Droid 2, Gingerbread, rooted.
B005LY4B0A|2.0|Fun, but does not scale properly on Xoom tablet. No zoom option under Honeycomb either so it doesn't use all of the screen.
0763650447|5.0|This book was well worth the money! The content was easy for my two and a half year old to follow, the story was engaging, and the book came with a page of fish stickers and a video DVD!  Awesome!!!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The BD set is even more disappointing than the DVDs.  Why, oh why, can't Lucas give us the theatrical versions of the films?  George, have you ever heard the expression, \\"don't mess with a good thing?\\"  Stop sticking your fingers in the galactic soup!    If you haven't bought these yet...don't.  If you have...mail them to George Lucas in protest.  Preferably smashed.        Amazon, we need a <1 star option.  1/8 star would be good here.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I have read about the problems other customers had with this protective case, but did not have any with mine. It fits well and holds tight, no problems to reach the buttons. Ir actually looks better on a white phone but I got used to and I'm very happy with the case.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Why oh why George, do you feel the need to destroy the childhood memories of millions of 35-45 year old men all over the world?  First you emasculated Han by making Greedo shoot first, then you ruined Indiana by nuking the fridge, and you've delivered the lowest blow yet by changing Vader from the biggest bad a$$ to the biggest wussy not once but twice!  Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
0307272702|5.0|Finally, a truly scientific approach.  I've used the ideas for three months with very good results. Buy it - read it.

B004V98UKS|5.0|This is a good app w/ no probs so far. Maybe not quite 5 stars, but I'm giving them 5 to counteract those who have obviously been living in a cave since they still don't know how FAOTD works.   The gameplay is simple, but fun if you enjoy puzzle games like I do. At this point I've only played the first 3 levels, but even level 1 kicks the brain into gear. As long as the higher levels are as proportionally challenging as the early levels, puzzle lovers will be very happy. Hopefully future updates will add new levels to ensure continued usage of the application.
0812550757|5.0|I may be strange and part of the few...but I definitely liked \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" better than [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]]<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, \\"Ender's Game\\" was a great book as I mentioned previously. Yet, in all it's glory, \\"Ender's Game\\" is really nothing more than a long prologue to the real story - the one about human nature and how we deal with people who are different then we are - the story of hurt, pain and choices that come to rule you despite everything you do - the story about the freedom of truth and the healing touch of transparency - being real with people and sharing the pain within.<br /><br />  \\"No human being, when you understand his desires, is worthless. No one's life is nothing. Even the most evil of men and women, if you understand their hearts, had some generous act that redeems them, at least a little, from their sins.\\" -Andrew Wiggin<br /><br />  \\"Once you know what people really want, you can't hate them anymore. You can fear them, but you can't hate them, because you can always find the same desires in your own heart.\\" -Andrew Wiggin<br /><br />In addition, I would say that next to the [[ASIN:0393318672 The Ugly American]] this is the best cross-cultural book out there as it highlights the different viewpoints of life between humans and the aliens. No matter how hard we try, we usually end up trying to fit the actions and values of the foreign cultural into our own framework. Unfortunately this does not work...<br /><br />If we really want to understand someone, we must step outside of ourselves and try to see the world from through their eyes, their values and beliefs. It is hard thing to do...but it is something that our Lord Jesus did when He came from Heaven to Earth to walk among us and to show is the Way forward.

0062060554|5.0|Great Book! It kept me glued to it! I finished reading the book in a matter of days when I was on vacation. Suspensful and keeps you thinking and trying to figure out the truth.....
1451629184|4.0|The book was very interesting. I enjoyed learning about a serial killer from the victims eyes. He was just a different kind of killer.   The transaction was smooth, the seller sent the book quickly, and it arrived it in great condition.    thank you
0786838655|1.0|Children are advised to stick to Bulfinch to learn about Greek mythology.  The plot of this \\"modern myth\\" is about as memorable as a EULA and about as readable as a book of poetry by preteen girls.  I don't understand why everyone likes these books so much.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am blown away.....you will be too. Bad form on the reviews. 5 out of 5. Great picture, sound, added scenes, and value. Have fun with your low res movies, this version is king.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book had it all for me.  I loved the rich use of language, a true literary fiction.  The story was dark and mysterious and quite magical with the right amount of romance.  I tend to read books rather quickly so a book that takes me more than 2 days (this one took me 6) is great and gives me a chance to feel really invested in the story.  If most of the books you read are in the fantasy or literary fiction category this is a must read.  Overall, one of the best books I've read.
B004V98UKS|2.0|The app doesn't woth it, i deleted in ten mintues. The music is hitting my ears and the controls are incrediblu clumsy. Why left and right ares apart from up and down?
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I haven't read the book prior to seeing the movie which is something I don't normally do. So, I don't know how faithful this adoption is. However, I really enjoyed watching this film.<br /><br />The story of Benjamin Button is sweet, different, unique and eventually very sad. I guess that is inevitable for someone who was born very different from the rest of us. I'm not going to retell the plot as I'm sure a lot of reviewers did so masterfully, I'm going to say the reason why I liked this movie despite my distaste for *sad* and *depressing* endings without giving too much away.<br /><br />What made this story stand out for me isn't just the unique and mysterious circumstances surrounding Benjamin's birth but the moral behind the story. We live in a world that is fascinated with Youth and Beauty so much to the point of obsession. In a world where Cosmetic Surgeries and anti aging products are multi/billion if not trillion trades I think many people with gladly give everything they have/own to be in the shoes of Benjamin Button. Imagine growing Younger instead of older ? Imagine becoming more beautiful and healthy by the day instead of the other way round. I know it is impossible but if it were wouldn't you take it ?<br /><br />What I like about this film is that it keeps things realistic, It shows the *bad* side of getting younger. The side that the media doesn't show, the side that people don't know about or pay attention to or take for granted. Imagine if you were getting younger and younger by the year and everyone around is getting older. You won't be able to see your kids grow into adults, you won't be able to attend their graduations, school activities, or even weddings because by that time you'll be a child. You won't be able to age gracefully, see your grandchildren or die peacefully in your sleep as an old man/woman. I know many people wouldn't consider dying as an infant in their quest of getting younger but lets face it people aren't immortal and the only way to be forever young is to die in your youth.<br /><br />Just the idea of retiring to teenage hood and childhood instead of prime age and elderly is very exhausting to me. All the things that you'll have to sacrifice might not be worth it. I'm sure Benjamin Button wished he could be like the rest of his peers and age gracefully instead of the other way round but he had to submit and be content by his share, he rarely if ever complained about it and I admire his character a lot for that. I know there was a lot of implying on it but I was hoping that the author would somehow manage to make poor Benjamin age normally so he could live the rest of his life with the woman he loves and watch his daughter grow but still I couldn't complain because despite it being sad and depressing it does reflect the message it is trying to send.<br /><br />The Cast choice is perfect (IMO) I'm not a fan of Brad Pitt but this has to be one of my favorite movies by him along with Seven Years in Tibet. Cate Blanchett is a superb actress and I really liked her role here. This is the second Pitt/Blanchett collaboration and I liked it better than Babel.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for anyone who likes drama or is looking for something different. As long as you don't mind the somehow depressing ending it shouldn't be a problem however if you are looking for an action packed film with swashbuckling Brad Pitt then Oh, well you'll be greatly disappointed.ng is to die in your youth.

031261246X|5.0|This book of fiction runs through multiple vunerabilities that are all possible in todays connected world showing how dependant we are on such systems.  This is a must read for all people interested in computer security and is also a great read for the normal reader.  At times some of the technical concepts may be difficult to understand if you have little knowledge about the workings of a computer, but this will not affect your enjoyment of the book as these are briefly explained and not required to understand.    As a programmer, I enjoyed this book very much.

B002XUL6RG|5.0|A must add to your collection of cinematic classics.  The perfect gift for anyone of Irish pedigree.  Exposes the torture that British officials inflicted on their citizens from Ulster County.  Provides a lens into the bias that a ruling governing body has for its subjects.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|I really liked this collection of articles that more or less flow into a book. It was a very short, but mind expanding read. Exactly what you want to consume on a Kindle.<br /><br />A majority of the articles do a great job explaining the concept of managing your life in a way that simplifies and enhances at the same time. She is generally strong on perspective, and has a few food executable ideas, but this is a more how to think, not what to book, and that's fine.<br /><br />After #47 or so though, the book goes off the rails as she starts to get repetitive and, dare I say, cluttered. The final articles could really have used some editorial help. If she had cut those down, removed the overlap, and not added the into to her bigger book as an afterthought, this would be a no brainer five star review.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Unlike 99% of previous reviews, I actually have this Blu-ray set.  I started out watching episode IV, curious to see how bluray would treat 40 year material, and all I can say is WOW!  It really looks like it was filmed yesterday.      The picture quality is one of the best quality bluray's I have in my library.  Blurays are hit and miss as most of you know, where some are just conversions from dvd's, where the pic is grainy and not really HD.  Not here... what a great addition to my library!!    I have enjoyed Star Wars since I was a kid, and this is indeed the crown jewel of Star Wars, they did a FANTASTIC job!  Not sure how you can make 40 year old film look this crisp and clear!    *DISCLAIMER*  I don't pretend to be a super star wars nerd where I know every second of every scene, dress up in jedi robes and painted broom sticks for light sabers when going to the movie theater (really people?), or like Han shooting Greedo first blah blah blah..   ************    I did see the Han/Greedo scene here and it looks like they almost shoot at the same time now.  The discoloring of the desert when C3PO and R2 land from escaping with the Death Star plans has been fixed.  Also the sound from when Obi-Wan saves Luke from the sand people (that WOOOOOOOOO sound) has been changed from the previous Triology DVD collection.    I am not a Lucas hater, but I'm not a fanboy either.  I just enjoy watching Star Wars.  Again, I think one would be hard pressed to say that they would be disappointed with this purchase.  It also comes with several bonus blurays with bonus material.    I look forward to watching the rest of the collection with my kids!      *Side Note*  Currently, I have only watched Episodes IV and V, my only complaint thus far is the oldest complaint in HD.. the Black Bars on top and bottom of the screen before movies were shot in native 16:9 ratio.  I will update this once I see the Episodes 1-3 and see if the black bars on there as well.
B0055S348W|5.0|I have always wished that I could print from my phone. These days my phone can nearly replace my laptop for most tasks, but up until now I couldn't really print from it. Previously I tried google cloud print which requires you to have a computer on as a print server. This app is great because it can communicate with wireless printers directly with no need for a computer in between. So far my prints are turning out normal, no reduction in quality noticed from printing from my phone. I'm so glad that I got this for free, but after having used it I would actually consider paying for it. It's a pretty essential function of anything that purports to be a computer.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I ordered this for my daughter's sleep over (She's 8).  I don't usually get expidited shipping but needed it for the weekend.  It got here just in time.  Too bad it was too scary for them to watch:)  I had forgotten since I hadn't seen it since it came out. I definatly enjoyed seeing it though.
B0000C7GG2|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT! THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE MASTERPIECE OF MUSE, I LIKE ALMOST ALL THE SONGS, BUT THE REASON TO BUY THIS ALBUM WAS \\"STOCKHOLM SYNDROME\\".
B00402FGE4|5.0|Don't let the name fool you, this is not a repetition of earlier StarGate franchises. The producers spun this in a whole different direction. It is darker, far more intense, and contains superb acting. The story and plot line are well written, but then add in the brilliant acting and directing, and it takes the show a notch above most similar shows, by producing depth and drama that are simply addictive. Some people say the series starts slow in the first couple of episodes, but once you dive into the plot and the core of the characters, you will find this to be one of the best dramas to ever grace the small screen. Superlatives that come to mind are intense, powerful, profound, dark. If you ever felt (if only momentarily) bored with SG-1 or SGA, I assure you, this will not happen here. StarGate Universe is a true masterpiece and a significant accomplishment for the producers and directors. Finally, a sci-fi show that could go neck in neck with the best dramas out there beating many of them. 5 stars barely does it justice.
B0055S348W|5.0|This is, by far, the best printer application available for Android. I've used a few others and none of them come even close to matching this app in ease of use, user interface, and functionality. This is very simple to use, and allows you to change a few options when printing (print quality, page margins, page orientation, etc.). For anyone looking for an exceptional printer app, I highly recommend PrinterShare. Worked perfectly on G2 and Iconia A500.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|When my book group elected to read The Art of Racing in the Rain, I groaned. Not a book where a dog tells the story! But I was wrong, after reading the first few pages I was hooked. Enzo is a philosopher that is not stuffy, a humanitarian, a playmate, a comfort and most importantly a good friend. By the end of the book I wanted to get a dog. So, dog lovers or not, give this charming, thoughtful book a go. The characters are believable, the story touching and the writing is grand.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Looks great, runs great, plays great.  Has enough going on that eventhough a puzzle may be solvable in 4 or 5 moves, it takes a fair amount of thinking to find the solution.

031265068X|1.0|I buy the argument that Marc Rich suffered due to a zealous legal process and that the prosecutors built their careers on this case. However, the author's name should be added to the list of folks who build their standing on Marc Rich as well.  I wouldn't be surprised if he was paid by Marc Rich to write this book.<br /><br />The book has a vague timeline, but a bunch of stories from random times in Marc's life.  They're all put together to show Marc in good light.  Secondly, even from a literary perspective, this is a poorly written book.  And of course the author pays rich tribute to the Mossad which is relevant at times but mostly obligatory.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|I'm sorry, but I just can't take seeing Han walk over Jabba's tail one more time.  The additional footage and CGI completely ruin the experience for me.  What was once the best movie ever made has become a sort of annoyance and disappointment.  It was hard for me at first, but I'm just starting to accept that I have fallen out of love.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|I find it difficult to sleep through this alarm, unlike many others. The feature to solve math problems before being able to turn off the alarm or snooze helps get me more awake than if I were just reaching over to push a snooze button. My favorite feature, however, is the ability to force the alarm through the speakers. I like to sleep listening to music on my phone with earbuds in, which fall out of my ears while I sleep; the stock alarm sounds through the earbuds (which I cannot hear), but this one still alarms through the speakers if headphones are plugged in.
030788743X|5.0|I find the overall story is well thought out and well written. I found myself powering through the book as it was engaging, much like the virtual world of the story. Some aspects were somewhat predictable, but I would recommend this to anyone with even a remote interest in a single aspect of the story (1980s, virtual reality, gaming, etc)
B004SGWYVA|5.0|First off, I agree with everyone else that it is short. The ending could have definitely had some more episodes come after it. Unfortunately, this series does not come with the OVA, which disappointed me but for the product iself, is definitely worth the $$. The series is exciting, the characters are fantastic, and the ecchiness is pretty good (lol). Probably not the anime for younger kids though due to some graphical content but hey that's anime for you. Get this series, you will not be disappointed.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I've been listening to Anthrax as long as I can remember. The first Album I owned was Among the Living, which back in the 80's was fantastic and one of Metal's Classics. I've stuck with them through out all the line up changes. I enjoyed most of the John Bush stuff, but Joey was always the voice of Anthrax for me. As time went on I lost intrest with Anthrax, but still jammed to them on occasion. Then came along the Big 4 Release last year. In my opinon Anthrax stole the show and breathed new life into my love for them.   I just listened to this album last night and was immediately blown away! The first song, \\"Earth on Hell\\" was a eye opener and a hell of away to open this album. All the songs are great in my opinon and \\"In the End\\" is the stand out track for me. It was very nice to hear Joey back on vocals. He has defeniatley changed over the years, but for the better. Charlie Benante's drumming is brutal. I consider him one of the best drummers out there and this album showcases why I think that.     This album is sure to please both Joey and John era fans. The music stands up with the Bush era stuff, and the vocals bring you back to the 80's era Anthrax. A definite must buy for Anthrax fans and the best Metal album so far in 2011!
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I am a very happy customer to be able to buy these eartips separately! I broke my original one somehow and these were available. In retrospect, I probably should have bought a pack of different sizes because these happened to be too small after I got them, but they certainly do the job! Next time, I'll look for a pack of various sized tips because I was uncertain of which to get for my ears. Nevertheless, I am happy with the product!

0385534639|3.0|I was first made aware of Erin Morgenstern's \\"The Night Circus\\" when I heard that David Heyman (producer of the Harry Potter films) had chosen it as his next project.  As a hugh HP fan and someone who has great respect for Heyman's taste and sensibilities, I jumped at the chance to read the book when it became available through Amazon's Vine Program.  Sad to say, I have been greatly disappointed.  Things start well enough -- Morgenstern knows how to whet our appetites with the mysterious, magical goings-on -- but after 75 pages...then 100...then close to 200 pages one is left thinking, \\"When do we leave the midway and get to The Big Top?\\"  Things have certainly happened (the circus has opened, a magical competition has begun, people have fallen in love, a character has died) but more than halfway through the book, there's no sense whatsoever of where it's heading.  Morgenstern seems more interested in describing things (acts of magic, clothing, dinner party menus) than in constructing a suspenseful, involving storyline.  (The constant jumping back and forth between time frames is also unnecessarily confusing.)  Such a prolonged set-up wouldn't be so bad if Morgenstern were a better writer, one whose prose were as rich, delightful and transcendent as the circus she describes ad infinitum.  She's certainly not a bad writer -- her dialogue is quite good -- but she doesn't seem to know when to put down the pen, so to speak.  Whole chapters of the book could have been excised without in any way affecting the plot (what little there is of it).<br /><br />I also can't say that I was much involved with the characters in any way.  Marco and Celia, our star-crossed, magical lovers are particularly devoid of interest.  We're told what they do, how they feel, but get no sense of them as living, breathing human beings.  They're archetypes in a colossal romance/morality tale of good magic vs. bad that I found fun for a while, but ultimately a waste of time, despite things heating up in the book's second half.  (As one character says towards the end, \\"I am not terribly invested in the outcome.\\")  Not that I was looking for deep literary meaning, by the way -- when I want Tolstoy I'll read Tolstoy -- but popular entertainment should have the page-turning momentum and energy of a great roller coaster ride.  \\"The Night Circus\\" is instead like a gorgeous, slow carousel that goes round and round, ultimately repetitive and getting absolutely nowhere.  I can see what attracted Heyman to the project -- the book is written in the style of a screenplay, and the images will make for some fantastic cinema -- but there's no there there.  \\"The Night Circus\\" is all flash and illusion, style minus substance, a travelling flea circus when one is wishing for the \\"stupendous spectacle\\" of The Greatest Show on Earth.n the book's second half.

B0034G4P80|2.0|I love all of the superhero movies, but I didn't get the drama and suspense of an Ironman or Spiderman movie.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is all I have to say, the films look great, it has tons of extras (on blu-ray disc), excellent sound and its a great box set. Most of these haters on the disc are either not old enough to have even seen the original movies in their original glory, or they're the crazy fan boys who feel they have the right to do anything they want to Lucas's creation (making their own gay ass movies). If you watch the movies for the story and wonder of Star Wars, these disc are a 5 of 5, If you a nerd who looks for problems with movies and doesn't care about accually enjoying the story then yes the set is a 1 of 5. Stop hating and enjoy the movies.

1594484805|2.0|\\"Pink relies heavily on Maslow's hierarchy focusing on the top--self-actualization. This book discusses motivation for people who are already at the top of the pyramid. Basically, they are self motivated and don't need external rewards such as raises. However, this does not hold true for individuals placed lower on the pyramid. If 'hygiene' needs are not being met--such as a fair wage--money can be and is a motivator. I think it would be difficult to apply Pink's theories to children. A child, hopefully, will have been provided with the lower tiers of the hierarchy. They haven't had the experience of working their way through the various steps of the hierarchy. Children's drives can be more primal than adults. They haven't learned, yet, to control them. They will, naturally, be on the bottom of the pyramid. \\"

0738212415|3.0|To be fair, i gave this a 3/5 rating, because it didn't help me at all, but it will be a good book for the total beginner, like the level of a kindergarten? i mean, it will teach you about shading and shadow (which is basically common sense) and will go through the different premitive shapes and how they cast shadows. It will also teach you how to do faces (like there are millions of tutorials on the web).    It took me 12 days to finish the book, because i wasn't dedicating only 20mins per lesson, but few hours a day, and i found the book repetitive. If you have kids that you want them to better grasp drawing, this book is for them. it wasn't intended for the beginner with little knowledge of drawing.
B000008CSN|5.0|The best sounding Live at the Fillmore East is the Mobile Fidelity Gold Disc version.  The Gold Disc edition puts the listener right in the front rows of the venerated venue and the more detailed recording's soundstage and sonic depth gives the listener a better sense of the Fillmore East's sonic signature like no other version can. If you have a high quality sound system (not a computer, IPOD, MP# or car audio system), and think AAB's Live at the Fillmore East is among the Top Five of Rock's Greatest Recordings, then you must treat yourself with the MFL Gold Disc edition.  Otherwise, any other edition - vinyl, CD, SACD, etc... will simply be recordings while Gold Disc almost recreates the experience for you.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|\\"Growing up we both had dreams. Dave wanted to be an astronaut, I wanted to sell dolphins on the black market. But found thats hard to do. We live in Atlanta... dolphins are hard to find...\\"  When single Mitch (Reynolds) and married with children Dave (Bateman) go out they begin talking about each others lives.  Both feel like the other one has a better life, then they take a pee.  When they wake up the fun begins.  Going in I was hoping for a few laughs, mainly because I think the two actors are hilarious.  The first half hour was hard to watch, because I was laughing so hard my side hurt and I was crying.  Not since \\"Wedding Crashers\\" was I blown away by the comedy that I was not expecting.  By that I mean not only the extreme shocking moments, but the timing between the two and the dialog was so funny that I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. The only bad thing I have to say about this movie is that it started off on a full run but turned a little more sappy at the end.  On the flip side, that part balanced out the rest of it just enough to give your cheeks and side a break.  This is a definate R rated comedy that men and women will both love.  That is hard to do.  I loved it a lot.  Overall, next to \\"Hall Pass\\" the funniest movie I have seen since \\"Wedding Crashers\\".  This movie will not disappoint. I give it an A.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Absolutely.  I want to buy this.<br /><br />*Also try - Hall Pass & Wedding Crashers
B003INBOEC|5.0|I really enjoyed this flic and the Ip Man 2 as well! Donnie Yen is clearly one of the greatest martial artists on the planet! However I have heard nothing of a decent 3rd movie that picks up to the point where he actually teaches Bruce lee. I have read other reviews of the a third movie which say its terrible and not worth the money. So the only resort is to seek biographers of the Ip Man to get an accurate idea of what he was about in reality.
B005974CDU|4.0|Dream Theater releases their best in a LONG time. I began obsessively following Dream Theater when Images and Words came out. I've been hot and cold on every album that was released since Metropolis Part II Mostly because I am just not into Jordan Ruddess as a writing musician. He's an amazing musician don't get me wrong, although I thought that Kevin Moore and Derek Sherinian surpassed him in the writing area. Ruddess does pull off his most impressive peformance (in my opinion) to date though. He contributes very much to this album and if it continues this way I might be converted from the Kevin Moore purist that I am. John Petrucci delivers on this album as well. Technically I was impressed as ever but melodically... He is capable of so much more. I was very pleased with James Labrie here. Gone are his black metal growls and back is the voice that brought me to love his singing so many years ago. The only misstep was the last section of vocals from the closing track \\"Beneath The Surface\\". He sang it an octave higher and it just didn't work for me, maybe it will for others but to me it just sounded cliche and corny. Not much to say about Myung who never has anything to say about anything anyway. His playing is solid as ever. He does it well. Now on to Mike Mangini... I like him! I guess he came in after the majority of the material was written so he didn't have proper time to really lay is down like a drum maniac but the guy is definitely on the level. I wish they would have mixed him just a little higher though. Maybe this is misdirected revenge for Portnoy's drums always being too loud in the mix? It's a little strange and sad that technically, Petrucci and Myung are the only remaining original Dream Theater members. I am looking forward to their new album now with a full Mike Mangini showcase and hopefully a Dream Theater that continues to rekindle the flame and find their footing again.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Warning contains spoilers:    I was 50% into this book and decided I hated it! How can you talk to someone 2/3 times and go on one date and profess your love on the first date? Seriously? Nicholas Sparks never develops the characters relationships. It is just hey we met and guess what...I love you! How can you root for the characaters when you never get to see the relationship develop? The book got better as it went along but I was so dissapointed in this one.
0441013597|5.0|It's hard to add anything to what's been said about Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" in the 45 years since it first appeared. \\"Dune\\" was already a classic when i read it in 1981, and unlike many SF books from the cusp of speculative fiction's New Wave, its impact remains as timeless now as it did then. Herbert grounded his sprawling tale of imperial politics and ecological revolution in a character story worthy of Tolstoy, downplaying the nuts-and-bolts aspects of his milieu's technology in a way that prevents \\"Dune\\" from seeming stale, even today.<br /><br />As with many of the most seminal works of speculative fiction and fantasy, the most amazing thing about \\"Dune\\" is how close it came to never seeing print, having been passed over by twenty publishers before being initially picked up by a nonfiction small press. In the canon of F&SF, there are few books whose importance literally cannot be understated. \\"Dune\\" is one of those. Without it, the world of imaginative literature would not be the same.<br /><br />I break with a lot of Herbert fans in my complete dispassion for the later \\"Dune\\" books, including the capstone of the original trilogy, \\"Children of Dune\\". To anyone who hasn't read the books, my recommendation is always to read \\"Dune\\" and \\"Dune Messiah\\" back to back as one continuous narrative, with the sequel bringing Herbert's vision to a satisfying and heartbreaking end.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|As much as I have a distaste for Lucas over the last 14 years (since that first abomination of a \\"Special Edition\\" came out)..I have to think that FOX is just as guilty of tapping the well here.     Case in point...Look how Aliens blu ray was handled. Initially an expensive set with basically the same special features as the two-disc special editions from 2003 or so...only to release the individual films on blu ray 9 months later...with NO special features.     I would almost be willing to bet money that the \\"original\\" versions will hit blu ray in a year. Even then...I will never give Lucas another dime of my money ever again.

0307716988|5.0|Even if I am not a die heart Michael Jackson fan, I will still love reading this book.  I got the book in April 2011 and finished reading it the first time in May 2011.  It took me that long because I live a very busy life with 2 jobs and busy travelling schedules.  To me, fining the time to read the book is tough.  I think everyone, including those who are not Michael Jackson fans, will love reading this book and will be fascinated by Michael Jackson's autobiography that openly and honestly tells the world everything about how he was brought up, how Jackson 5 and he rose to fame, how he became the most popular and most accomplished entertainer.  I really wish Michael Jackson has continued to write about himself after finishing this book in 1988 to dispute all those so-call biographies that, in fact, were written with bias and opinionated judgment

This really pisses me off because I cannot imagine how sloppy their packaging must be that they would miss this.  Also even though the box was still in plastic shrink wrap there was obvious signs of damage to the outside of it.  I have yet to listen to the CD's but with what I have seen so far I worry that the recordings might be damaged also.  I would recommend staying away from Brilliant Classics.  Yes they cost less but they are also of inferior quality.  You get what you pay for.

0385534639|5.0|I have missed reading A Series of Unfortunate Events and Harry Potter.  This book filled that void.  The writing is clear and I honestly have never read a book that can set a scene so well.  You live this unusual circus.  It's light on plot and not too deep, but atmosphere is everything here.  The motives are not as clear cut and satisfying as Harry Potter and there is really no evil just two differing schools of thought.  I did find the \\"love\\" angle not well enough portrayed.   Chapters are short allowing for a quick pick up and put down.  The one sex scene would be appropriate for teen, but I doubt this is a good book for the pre-teen set.  It will make a good movie.  Let's hope Hollywood doesn't screw it up!

I hear its a great 3D disc though so it looks as though I shall have to get the local version.

B005J4ASDG|4.0|Firstly, this isn't a review of the music itself, but of the structure of the Symphony and the performance of the musicians.  I assume anybody reading this already has knowledge and appreciation for Howard Shore's music, which on its own terms is 5-star, must-own stuff.<br /><br />Now that's out of the way, what of the Symphony?  To call it a symphony is something of a stretch, since it doesn't follow the structure of a traditional classical symphony.  Basically, The Lord of the Rings Symphony is a very long, comprehensive suite representing music from the scores of all three films.  There are six movements; two movements apiece for each of the films.  Consider it a highlight reel of the best moments from the scores.  Nothing will ever replace hearing the scores in their gargantuan entirety, but listening to the Symphony is a wonderful experience on its own.  Although many may have preferred a true 'symphony' in the classical sense, organized by theme and counterpoint, etc., that seems somewhat illogical given the subject material.  Instead, the Symphony follows the narrative structure and order of the films.  It's like Cliffs Notes for the original scores.  Frankly, the work would be far more appropriately called a suite, similar to a lengthy ballet suite, but oh well, it's the content and not the title that's important.  Also, if you or someone else you know has previously managed to avoid hearing Shore's music, the Symphony would be a great introduction.<br /><br />As far as the performances themselves, I was skeptical considering I haven't previously heard of the 21st Century Symphony Orchestra (the name sounds cheesy), nor of Ludwing Wicki (conductor).  I was fortunate enough to attend a concert with Shore himself conducting the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, and the results were unforgettable.  Needless to say I had very high expectations for an eventual recording of the Symphony, but much to my dismay, one was never released despite the release of the Complete Recordings and the Rarities Archive.  That makes this recording an unexpected surprise, timed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the first film.  Thankfully, my concerns were assuaged.  The performance of the 90-piece, German-based orchestra and around 100-strong semi-professional chorus was fabulous.  The brass in particular rose spectacularly to the occasion.  Even the soloists did their best to imitate the originals with acceptable results.  Thanks to maestro Wicki, the pacing is accurate and clean, though at times it can seem a little rushed.  Again, probably nothing will best the original performances by the London Philharmonic, but these performances often compare favorably to the interpretations of on-album excerpts by the City of Prague Philharmonic and Cincinnati Pops.  The only real knock I give this recording is that, as a result (I assume) of being recorded live, the sound quality suffers a bit.  That's not to say it's bad (it's actually decent), but the stereo separation doesn't feel as immersive and it's more difficult to pick out individual instruments.  Although audience noise is thankfully limited, there are two moments of applause on the recording - the first is after the second movement, and the second is after the last movement.  Keep in mind this is a review of the digital album I purchased on Amazon, but I imagine the standard CD listening experience would be very much the same.<br /><br />All in all, purchase this recording if you have any appreciation for Shore's magnum opus!  I guarantee you'll be glad you did.  I hope more recordings of the Symphony by other well-known orchestras will follow.Complete Recordings and the Rarities Archive.

0385534639|3.0|I didn't have many hopes for this novel after seeing it compared to Twilight; that may be why I was pleasantly surprised to see that the writing consisted of words greater than two syllables, no glaring grammar errors, no overusage of the Word 2000 synonym tool, and no exhaustingly repetitive words (chagrin, anyone?).<br />However, though this book is written in a rich and captivating prose, it lacks solid ground. Harry Potter this certainly is not. The main characters are flat and I couldn't quite grasp their reasoning for falling so in love with each other. The love just didn't seem real. The plot was a bit empty, since the characters were mainly weak and 2-dimensional (save for the Twins and maybe Bailey). I enjoyed the imagery of the novel, which is why I didn't give it two stars, but if you are looking for the next Harry Potter, keep looking. There were also a lot of gaps in the story, questions that were never answered, and mysteries that weren't explained.<br />I won't continue to go on about the plot or characters, as I think most of the 1-3 star reviewers captured my own sentiments exactly. My second biggest complaint (following weak characters) is the tense the author chose to write in. The majority of the novel is written in third person present, that alone would be annoying and completely disconnects the reader from the characters...but in addition, she uses second person present inserts throughout the novel, which was just irritating!<br />I'd recommend this book to people who enjoyed The Historian and The Thirteenth Tale, and would probably read this author's next novel. But the pushing of this debut novel is another sneaky move by publishers who are just too anxious to find the next \\"big book.\\"
0857204084|5.0|I love the look into 1950s Soviet Union...I hope it's historically accurate. Regardless of historical accuracy though, the portrait of the protagonist, Leo, as a reformed soul seeking redemption, the dim vistas of 50s Soviet society and landscape, and the roller coaster plot made reading this book my sole recreational activity for 4 days.  Occasionally, the hare's breath escapes get a little long--a lot of detail when you know Leo is going to escape.  Nonetheless, there are enough plot twists to keep you turning pages.

Some of the artwork found in those Warren Magazines of the sixties and seventies, is among the greatest ever produced for the comic medium. The names are legendary; we know them all.  Some of the best artwork done during that heady time was by a guy named Berni Wrightson, who subsequently put the \\"e\\" back on his first name.  Mr. Wrightson is one of our greatest living comic artists, and some of HIS best work was seen in these pages.  So...take EVERYTHING he did for Warren, in a ridiculously affordable but lovingly produced package...and you have one of the archival collections of the year.  You will sit goggle-eyed and astonished at the brushwork here, beautifully reproduced on thick stock.  Stories I can remember as if I read them yesterday are here. \\"The Black Cat\\", \\"Jenifer\\", \\"The Pepper Lake Monster\\", \\"Nightfall\\", \\"Cool Air\\"...and to have \\"The Muck Monster\\" in brilliant, lurid color is a treat in and of itself.  The exquisite frontispieces from Creepy and Eerie are all here too.  There are a few surprises here as well; the context of which are illuminated by a heart-tugging introduction by Bruce Jones. Definitely read it before you start. It's well worth your time.  For fans of Creepy and Eerie, this is a must-buy. I guarantee you'll be completely satisfied.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a great movie, and many of the best movies made are now animated features.  It's a silly and lame plot, but what carries the movie are the diversity and the likability of the characters.  A truly clever and fun movie for everyone.
B005NZH1JA|5.0|Spoiler? I don't think so but someone else does so be duly warned.<br /><br />TRUE ROMANCE is a favorite crime movie of virtually every fan of that genre.  Its shootout scene is a movie classic.  Quentin Tarantino wrote it before he began directing.  The back half of this episode has a very similar scene in it.  It is done every bit as masterfully and with absolute panache and style. At the center of it is Gus and he is totally back in full lethal form.  This is not the whole episode.  There is also an excellent segment with Walt and his son plus an excellent showdown between Skyler and the IRS scofflaw.  However, those will be all but swept from your mind as you encounter this end segment, played out in the new Southwest but straight out of the style of the old Southwest!
B0054NQZ9S|4.0|America no longer makes anything, and that's what's wrong with it.  Or that is at least the message of \\"The Company Men,\\" a heavy-handed but nevertheless engrossing film about the cannibalizing of a shipping company, which is in itself a metaphor for the cannibalizing of the American manufacturing sector (hardworking and honest workers) by the financial sector (silver-tongued and slick-haired accountants).  Everyone gives solid, credible performances (including Kevin Costner and Ben Affleck), and the movie moves at a good pace.      It's a movie that's meant to pull at the heartstrings of all those millions of the angry and confused, and it works.  But perhaps it works all too well -- the message is far too optimistic and simplistic for the times that we face.  But it's Hollywood, after all.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm shocked at how immature most of these reviews are.  Writing a 5 page diatribe on why this set of amazing films is 'utter trash,' etc.  Most of these reviews are from before the product was released, based specifically on the fact that the 'Original Theatrical' editions were not included.  Those reviewers are right, they are not included, and I will say that I believe the set benefits from it.  The saga feels like it all connects, like it is one story of six films rather than two separate sagas of varying quality.  And Vader's new line at the Emperor's demise doesn't change anything.  It doesn't make him 'whiny' as so many are claiming, and will only ruin the scene if you allow it to.  I actually forgot about the new Krayt dragon call until my gf reminded me of it.    First, let's look at the content of the films.  All six star wars films stand out from the cinematic crowd in almost every way.  The costumes, design, sets, creatures, ships, etc. are all incredible to look at and really stand out in Blu-Ray.  You'll notice art on the walls of Theed palace and wonder what sort of history that piece has for their planet, and see the scratches on Plo Koon's breather.  The creativity and artistry that have gone into all six films is mind-blowing.  As is the overarching story.  I've heard a lot of people say \\"Always watch 4 - 6 first.\\"  I'd disagree with that and say watch them in the order they're packaged and intended to be seen, 1 - 6.  Anakin becomes a much more tragic character and you'll watch 4-6 and your heart will break a little bit at his unmasking.  I was a prequel hater for a long time, but I must say that it's been 11 years since Episode I and it's time to give these movies another chance.  They really are phenomenal films, despite the acting and dialogue's stiff moments - but even the originals have some eye-roll worthy lines, so it just kind of adds to the character of the films.  It's not the Dark Knight, it's Star Wars - a samurai-western-sci-fi-fantasywith muppets.  And that is what makes it awesome.    One thing I noticed is that the originals are shot in a much more critical focus than the prequels, which does affect the way they display in HD.  There seems to be a lot more to see in the prequels, the screen estate is occupied with various eye catching designs, costumes, etc and it almost looks real.  Much of the originals are shot in critical, so the back and fore ground become more blurry.  This is more of a comment than a criticism, the focal range is part of the film's artistry, but it does create a visual discontinuity in production style.  The originals do look incredible in HD.  You can see all of Chewie's hair (and a few strays of Tarkin's), the texture of Ben's robe, etc.  They look like real people in your living room.  And the soundtrack is wondrous - getting a perfect rumble without ever peaking.    Finally, and I haven't gotten to look at all of them yet, but the special features are totally packed with content.  Each episode is divided into planets, showing the production of that particular part of the film, and within each planet are deleted scenes, concept art, interviews (which I thoroughly enjoyed and I believe are brand new), and some rotating maquettes that really show off the interactivity of your Blu Ray player.  One *slight* criticism is that there is no way to watch ALL the deleted scenes at once.  You can only watch each film's deleted scenes within each planet.  I understand this for the sake of organization, because there is SO MUCH that it would become a mess of features if it weren't split up somehow, but I did find myself getting a little lost in the menus at times.  On top of all that, there's 8 or 9 documentaries from over the years about various production aspects, and a 90 minute compilation of spoofs from all different media.  I'm really looking forward to that one.    If you're a fan of the saga, or are looking for something to really show off your home theater system, thisis a worthy investment.  I already own these movies in 3 or 4 different incarnations, but this set blows them all away and was definitely worth the price of admission.  I will get enjoyment out of this for years to come.  Thanks, Lucasfilm.

B001F290E4|5.0|Seal burst upon the world in 1991 with a global hit album SEAL that garnered three top-20 hit singles and two more top-40 hits, clearly better than half of a nine track album full of unique compositions with style, lyrical, tempo, and key changes.  Though slotted often as a \\"soul/R&B\\" album, SEAL and its follow-up also called SEAL, which garnered three additional top-20 hits, including the Batman Forever soundtrack standout Kiss From A Rose, are really far from traditional Soul or R&B.  His writing and performing style more closely resembled the experiment post-wave rock of Tears For Fears and others.  After three smash albums, Seal's popularity in the USA began to decline with smaller and smaller sales, even though in European markets the diminishing returns were less notable.  Seal continued through this last decade to be a top-notch performer despite the more lackluster sales compared to SEAL, SEAL (II), and HUMAN BEING.<br /><br />In 2008, Seal joined forces with \\"Hit Man\\" David Foster to produce an album comprised entirely of cover songs.  Not just any cover songs but covers of literally the greatest soul-R&B singles in the canon of a genre.  These classics are embedded in the brains of nearly every baby boomer who ever turned on a radio, bought 45 rpm singles, attended a high school dance, entered a bar with a jukebox, or gathered at the late evening drive-in.  The project at face value sounded like something doomed to failure from the get-go.  But one has to bear in mind that this was a superstar with a terrific voice, and a man whose prowess as producer, arranger, and talent manager is unparalleled.  It was literally a marriage made in heaven, so the choice of material was a fully loaded intercontinental ballistic missile.  I had my fears, do not doubt that for a second!  But once you listen to the first track, the song he performed nationally on nearly every mid-day to late night talk show, morning news and chat show, and in prime time on the television show Eli Stone, the song that entered the charts as a hit single on adult contemporary \\"Smooth Jazz\\" radio and worked its way up R&B/Hip Hop charts, the immortal Sam Cooke's A Change Is Gonna Come, once you hear it if you haven't already, then you know this is going to be a Killer album.  Up front I will say it is not a \\"perfect\\" album, but it is a darned good one!<br /><br />The only way I can honestly review this album is by means of a method I really dislike using, but in this case, a song by song analysis is truly in order.  I want to give you a well balanced report on this album which I purchased from Amazon the day it came out and have been listening to for almost three years now.  Why did I wait so long?  Honestly I am way behind in my cue of reviews and given the time I have waited, I have listened to this album enough now to provide a solid balanced report rather than a knee-jerk reaction.  Had I written this even two years ago, I might have said that only half the album was worthy.  But I have since been able to compare the originals, other covers, and done so numerous times by just listening to my own music collection.  Honestly this is an album you can purchase, rip it to your portable player and listen to these songs individually as they come up in any random play mode, or mix into a homemade CD without having to listen to the entire CD to appreciate.  You can though, pop this CD into the car stereo as I have done many times and allow it to accompany you to work or back or both.  The question to ponder is how is Seal's voice on these songs?  Don't bother asking about David Foster's arrangements and production, the man has magic spirits that turn pretty much everything he touches into gold, no matter who the end audience is.  So let's take a close look at the material.<br /><br />A Change Is Gonna Come.  Sam Cooke's triumphant civil rights anthem has become so highly acclaimed it is ranked #12 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time. I personallyhave counted no less than 70 different artists who have covered this song since the original release and I am sure there are more \\"less popular\\" recordings out there.  Seal has both the vocal power and the proper timbre in his voice to sing this song and make it sound as great as the original, especially given today's recording technology.  Add to that David Foster's powerful orchestral arrangement and you have a giant recording!<br /><br />I Can't Stand The Rain.  Originally by Ann Peebles, this 1973 hit was named by John Lennon as \\"the best song ever\\".  One look at the way it dominated the various charts all over the world might prove him right.  It was in the top 20 of 18 different countries, and in 14 of those was in the top 10.  In 1984 Tina Turner included it on her PRIVATE DANCER album and it found its way into the charts of the USA, UK, Germany, and France.  The other truly great cover of this song is by Angeline Ball in the film (and on the soundtrack of the film) The Commitments.  Seal and Foster submit a straight forward rendition here with an excellent rendering of the song to a male vocal performance.  Not powerful but definitely pleasant.<br /><br />It's A Man's Man's Man's World.  James Brown's incredible #1 hit single of 1966 was called \\"almost biblically chauvinistic\\" by Rolling Stone magazine and those words have resounded around the song forever.  Regardless of how you feel about the song, and despite that the song infers within itself that it is all due to the woman, the performance has never been rivaled by a cover artist, save for possibly Joss Stone at The Kennedy Center in 2003.  Seal could have drowned himself in this song had it not been for the super-power orchestral backing of Foster.  His delivery is punchy as it should be.  To call it a straight cover would be sophomoric, since how else could the song be delivered.  The only question is does the artist have the chops to make it sound great?  Seal does!  The band and the orchestra bring this one to a crescendo with a proper James Brown fade out, Seal delivering the obligatory \\"lost in the wilderness...in his bitterness\\" nuances.  Remember this song was co-written with a woman and had to include her female observations.  That should at least calm some of those who would sully to call this song dated.<br /><br />Here I Am.  This is the first of two classics by \\"The Reverend\\" Al Green offered to us by Seal.  Taken from Green's masterpiece, Call Me, this single was his 3rd most popular song ever following close on the heels of Let's Stay Together and I'm Still In Love With You (also represented on this album).  Most of Seal's translations of these classics follow on his normal register, but in dealing with Al Green, Seal demonstrates a fine ability to soften up his vocal chords and raise the timbre close enough to an octave within reach of Al Green's unique voice.  Here I Am for the most part stays within the caliber of Seals normal range but he will stretch that for the next Al Green classic and marvelously well.  As with all these recordings, Foster arranges a tremendous backing on this.<br /><br />I've Been Loving You Too Long.  This Otis Redding single has more stature to it than it originally received as a single, a minor hit reaching #15 on the R&B charts and only clocked in at #85 on the Billboard pop singles.  Fans of this song grew with time and Rolling Stone magazine rank it as #110 on their 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time.  Seal gives this song a deserving rendition with spectacular respect to the author and Foster treats it rightly so with the instrumentation to keep it a blues based R&B single with just the right amount of orchestration.  The Rolling Stones covered this song with one of the greatest treatments, so fine that Otis returned the compliment by covering Satisfaction!  The all time best cover is however, without a doubt, Tina Turner's (with Ike) in 1968.  Not bad by Seal, above average.<br /><br />It's Alright.  The legendary Curtis Mayfield wrote and recorded this song in 1963 with his group The Impressions and it was a chart topper.  The best news for Seal is that It's Alright has not suffered from over-exposure by having countless covers.  This allows the song to be rendered very nicely by Seal with little emotional effect to the contrary.  In other words, you can listen to it without being reminded of other (better) artists, and in that respect, it ends up being thought of as one of the better performances on the CD.  But honestly that is only because of ear-prejudiced and if you can somehow shut out the instinct to compare, you would find that there are probably a half dozen songs on this album which are much better than this one.  It still deserves kudos though.  This is the first of two Mayfield tunes which Seal will work on this album.<br /><br />If You Don't Know Me By Now.  This is my choice for weak choice on this album.  Not that Seal does not have the vocal chops to close it, but even with Foster's delicate orchestral arrangements and piano work, Seal's rendition really adds nothing new nor unforgettable to the moment.  A Change Is Gonna Come, Man's World, Stand By Me, and even People Get Ready, famous as they are still tower way above this cover.  The trouble is that some serious vocalists have torched this song since the original Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes released this top of the charts hit single.  Gamble and Huff wrote the song for Patti LaBelle and her group Labelle but it was left \\"for later\\" and then when Teddy Pendergrass and company took it to the cleaners, well who was going to try and one-up that?  Almost two decades later an artist I dearly love, Simply Red, again sailed the ship to Number One with a rendition so heartfelt and emotional that it is difficult for me to acknowledge that Seal does do a fine job on the song.  It is just that after Pendergrass and Simply Red soared on this one love song with vocals to make a linebacker sob, the work by Seal leaves me thinking, isn't that nice.  Well \\"nice\\" makes not a spectacular thing.<br /><br />Knock On Wood.  Eddie Floyd's R&B rocker is a sort of concert staple for all kind of genre performers.  Otis Redding performed the first cover of this classic and since then, there have been nearly two dozen that I either own or at least have heard more than once!  Wilson Pickett, Buddy Guy, Harpers Bizarre, Ike & Tina Turner, Cher, Eric Clapton, Jeff Healey, Michael Bolton (yeah even him), James Taylor, just to name a few, all have hammered the tree with Knock On Wood.  Seal adds one more to the mix, a solid funky version performed well but again not spectacular and honestly another cover choice might have suited better than a song which even in its original form was over classified as a \\"classic\\".  But then that's just me.  You might love it!  I for one have grown tired of this song and so I can only be impartial by admitting that Seal does a good job and Foster as well.  Produced well, sung well, blah blah...<br /><br />I'm Still In Love With You.  Okay, now we are returning to the fold!  The second Al Green single included on this set was the right choice!  In fact Seal uses pitch and timbre here to perform a nice emulation of the original and it works quite well.  It is nuanced and phrased just right and you will be so glad to hear this song after the last two, you might boot this one right up to your number one favorite!  Wonderful, even delightful, instrumentation and vocals.  Despite the fact that this is perhaps Al Greens most famous song, one that everyone on earth adores, Seal sends it right down perfection alley, another home run.<br /><br />Free.  The second hit by a female R&B artist covered in this collection, Free was a '76 funk single by Deniece Williams.  This is perhaps the least commonly known song on the set and that works well in Seal's favor.  I for one even forgot who was responsible for the original hit and had to look it up!  Again, great instrumentation, arrangement, and vocals build up the case for Seals album after emerging from a shallow pool created by two or three lesser treatments in the middle of the set.  This song sets up the ending which goes out as big as the album opened up...<br /><br />Stand By Me.  Another of the most covered songs in the known universe, Ben E King's immortal classic has hit the charts so many times it is nearly impossible to count.*  My personal favorite cover of this song is by John Lennon of course, who took it to the singles charts from his ROCK & ROLL album.  His delivery is uniquely Lennon, gruffing the vocals for pure rock essence.  BMI, who keep track of such things, report that Stand By Me is the 4th most performed song of the 20th century, with something in the vicinity of 7 million performances.  Seal has the vocals to cover Ben E King with pride and the real power in this song comes from Foster who has the orchestra punch our lights out with swells of crescendo reminiscent of what he did for Michael Bubl&eacute;'s \\"Feeling Good\\".  You can't argue with a good thing and this song is the goodest thing on this album after the first track!<br /><br />People Get Ready.  A second entry from Curtis Mayfield's days with The Impressions closes SOUL.  Seal makes as good a choice closing the album (or rather Foster probably does that for him) as he did opening it.  With a huge boom, Seal grabbed us with one of the greatest anthems of all time.  Now he is going to put us to bed with one of the greatest spirituals of all time.  Rolling Stone picked People Get Ready as #24 on their list of the Greatest Songs Of All Time.  A panel of 20 songwriter producers, including Paul McCartney and Brian Wilson chose it for inclusion in the Top 10 Best Songs Of All Time.  Foster makes sure that the instrumentation on the song is both a tribute to and a hymnal nod to Curtis Mayfield by including his signature guitar break sound in Seal's cover.  This song, I have and know of over 40 different covers.  Unlike some others on this set and more like Stand By Me, these last two immortal God Songs which close the album, have so much resonance in our society that another cover does not \\"hurt\\" the song nor this album.  The question is whether or not, again, Seal stands up to the task, and just as with Stand By Me, Seal and Foster nail this one to the wall.  Thank you Seal for this spiritual delight, your delivery is as kind to the song as was Bob Marley's cover of it!<br /><br />*there are ostensibly over 400 recorded versions of Stand By Me.  Notable hit single covers of it are Spyder Turner's '67 hit in which he performs impressions of various R&B hit-makers singing the main verse in their style, Mickey Gilley's 1980 #1 Country hit cover from the Urban Cowboy soundtrack, Maurice White (of Earth Wind & Fire) had a top-10 R&B hit in '85, Prince Royce turned it into a #1 Latin single hit in 2010, John Lennon's '75 cover went to the top-20, and let's remember that Ben E King's original hit the charts twice: the original went to #1 in 1961, and then it was re-released as a single in conjunction with the Rob Reiner/Stephen King movie Stand By Me in 1986 when it peaked at #4 on the billboard charts.  Jimi Hendrix, Otis Redding, and Elton John all have fantastic cover recordings of this monumental song, and finally, for a couple of odd takes, Muhammad Ali included it on his 1963 album I AM THE GREATEST, and Stephen King and Warren Zevon recorded it together for a charity album STRANGER THAN FICTION in 1998<br /><br />I know this has been a long review, but if you are wanting to read an objective and decisive review for a \\"questionable\\" album (it has received \\"mixed\\" critical reviews, some rave about it, some torture it with the same glee they would devote to small animals) then I wanted to give that to you.  Your choice in the end.  My advice is buy it and enjoy it.  It is a Heart Full Of Soul.  If it were not for the stupendous performances on A Change Is Gonna Come, It's A Man's World, Stand By Me, and People Get Ready, this album would only warrant 4 Stars from me, but those four songs launch the CD as a whole into the atmosphere despite a couple lack-luster tracks that only seem lack-luster next to the more inspired tracks.  Go ahead.  This is Seal's best album since Human Being, and even if you are not an aficionado of that Seal era, if you are a lover of Soul and R&B hits, this is the CD you want.  Other artists (Michael McDonald for one) have gone to bat with this format and come up short.  This one is a homer with three men on base.Knock On Wood.  Eddie Floyd's R&B rocker is a sort of concert staple for all kind of genre performers.  Otis Redding performed the first cover of this classic and since then, there have been nearly two dozen that I either own or at least have heard more than once!  Wilson Pickett, Buddy Guy, Harpers Bizarre, Ike & Tina Turner, Cher, Eric Clapton, Jeff Healey, Michael Bolton (yeah even him), James Taylor, just to name a few, all have hammered the tree with Knock On Wood.  Seal adds one more to the mix, a solid funky version performed well but again not spectacular and honestly another cover choice might have suited better than a song which even in its original form was over classified as a \\"classic\\".  But then that's just me.  You might love it!  I for one have grown tired of this song and so I can only be impartial by admitting that Seal does a good job and Foster as well.  Produced well, sung well, blah blah...    I'm Still In Love With You.  Okay, now we are returning to the fold!  The second Al Green single included on this set was the right choice!  In fact Seal uses pitch and timbre here to perform a nice emulation of the original and it works quite well.  It is nuanced and phrased just right and you will be so glad to hear this song after the last two, you might boot this one right up to your number one favorite!  Wonderful, even delightful, instrumentation and vocals.  Despite the fact that this is perhaps Al Greens most famous song, one that everyone on earth adores, Seal sends it right down perfection alley, another home run.    Free.  The second hit by a female R&B artist covered in this collection, Free was a '76 funk single by Deniece Williams.  This is perhaps the least commonly known song on the set and that works well in Seal's favor.  I for one even forgot who was responsible for the original hit and had to look it up!  Again, great instrumentation, arrangement, and vocals build up the case for Seals album after emerging from a shallow pool createdby two or three lesser treatments in the middle of the set.  This song sets up the ending which goes out as big as the album opened up...    Stand By Me.  Another of the most covered songs in the known universe, Ben E King's immortal classic has hit the charts so many times it is nearly impossible to count.*  My personal favorite cover of this song is by John Lennon of course, who took it to the singles charts from his ROCK & ROLL album.  His delivery is uniquely Lennon, gruffing the vocals for pure rock essence.  BMI, who keep track of such things, report that Stand By Me is the 4th most performed song of the 20th century, with something in the vicinity of 7 million performances.  Seal has the vocals to cover Ben E King with pride and the real power in this song comes from Foster who has the orchestra punch our lights out with swells of crescendo reminiscent of what he did for Michael Bublé's \\"Feeling Good\\".  You can't argue with a good thing and this song is the goodest thing on this album after the first track!    People Get Ready.  A second entry from Curtis Mayfield's days with The Impressions closes SOUL.  Seal makes as good a choice closing the album (or rather Foster probably does that for him) as he did opening it.  With a huge boom, Seal grabbed us with one of the greatest anthems of all time.  Now he is going to put us to bed with one of the greatest spirituals of all time.  Rolling Stone picked People Get Ready as #24 on their list of the Greatest Songs Of All Time.  A panel of 20 songwriter producers, including Paul McCartney and Brian Wilson chose it for inclusion in the Top 10 Best Songs Of All Time.  Foster makes sure that the instrumentation on the song is both a tribute to and a hymnal nod to Curtis Mayfield by including his signature guitar break sound in Seal's cover.  This song, I have and know of over 40 different covers.  Unlike some others on this set and more like Stand By Me, these last two immortal God Songs which close the album, have so much resonance in our society that another cover does not \\"hurt\\" the song nor this album.  The question is whether or not, again, Seal stands up to the task, and just as with Stand By Me, Seal and Foster nail this one to the wall.  Thank you Seal for this spiritual delight, your delivery is as kind to the song as was Bob Marley's cover of it!      *there are ostensibly over 400 recorded versions of Stand By Me.

B002BJGYV2|5.0|If you are even thinking about buying season 5 of Gilmore Girls then you probably know the show pretty well, or are buying it for someone who does. This season keeps up with the fast-talking girls, witty one liners, and drama that you expect from the show.    I will advise viewers that haven't seen the show from this point on that, although all the elements that make this show great are there, the show really starts to lose a little bit of it's charm as Rory and Lorelai spend less time together. The mother and daughter really start to have separate story lines, and this can be kind of bumpy. However, when they are together (and getting along) it is perfect.    This is my favorite show of all time, and I still miss it. I have all the seasons, and watch it with friends who haven't seen the show all the time. It's undeniable charm and fast paced wit wins over anyone who can keep up. And if you think you know pop culture, this show will test your knowledge. I have many times paused the show to Google a name, or event reference that left me saying, \\"What!?!\\"    If you already love this show, I recommend Reba and I Love Lucy. Both of these shows have great elements of Gilmore Girls. (Don't blow off the Reba show just because you are not a country music fan. I don't care for her music, but she has one of the most natural comedic timing I have seen since Lucy. She plays a mom of 3 kids, an ex-wife trying to deal with the new wife, and a soon to be grandmother. The writing of this show is only outshined by Gilmore Girls)
B0054N73EY|4.0|I'm With You is a really good record but it is not a classic RHCP album. New guitarist, new vibe and the fact that the boys are getting older. They have given us a musical variety here and show off their talents. It's like when the Clash came out with London Calling--purists hated it. But now, it is a modern classic. No overt politics here (good!) but the mix of styles is exciting. Old time funk, salsa and even a beat borrowed from the Culture Club.    I would also say that there are shades of early U2 here. From the lyrics to the energy to the sparse, spacey guitar. It's like they borrowed Steve Lillywhite and Brian Eno for a few days to get that haunting sound that dominated the best U2 albums. (U2 lost their  mojo after Zooropa in my opinion.)    Check out the new and improved RHCP. You will enjoy the ride!
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Lady Antebellum has done it again, a very solid album. This is simply one of the best contemporary country cds of this year. I enjoyed every song on the album and they've all got some great production and real emotion in them. Charles, Hillary, and Dave should be proud of themselves. They are all talented and they know how to use it.
B005HSL626|4.0|Runs fine on Google Nexus with no lag. Hypnotically addictive. Primary beef is the sheer number of ads.  Sometimes there are pop up ads during the gameplay, which is quite annoying. Sometimes the ad won't load, further interrupting the game to the point that you have to back out to the home screen and reload the game. 4 stars because the game is so fun that it outweighs the problem with ads and would be 5 stars if this got fixed.
B0054N73EY|5.0|Despite having a brand new guitarist, the new Red Hot Chili Peppers' album is amazing! Definitively worth the purchase. I would highly recommend it to everyone with a pair of ears.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Game is good: fun but frustrating. Ads are placed inconveniently in the top right corner of the screen during gameplay and obscure important parts of the game. Would like to see this fixed so the ads don't block out part of the game.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I love this app! So many apps won't install on my phone, which I attribute more to the phone than the apps. I was doing a happy dance when this app installed and then actually opened. i have already had a blast playing this game. There are levels that frustrate me and make me want to pull my hair out to complete them and there are levels that amaze me on how easy they are to complete. This game will keep me busy playing and replaying for many hours!
B005LY4B0A|2.0|Lots of fun on my Droid Incredible, but it doesn't scale properly on my Xoom. It's playable, but shows up in a small box at the top of the screen. For some reason the \\"zoom to fit\\" button doesn't show up either.  Addendum: So I upgraded from my Incredible to a Galaxy Nexus, and with the higher resolution screen the game is all but unplayable. It takes up the whole screen, but buttons are not in the right locations and are impossible to hit. Please fix for high resolution devices!
B005CKPQHA|5.0|the best writing, directing, and acting on television.  each season successfully better than the previous one.  amazing!  bryan cranston is probably the best actor working today.  halfway through season 4 and am on the edge of my seat.  aaron paul also fantastic.
1881273873|4.0|This book is well written and easy to read. It is both encouraging and educational. Provides good insight into some of the most basic motivations and also an understanding of sources of hurt and conflict in relationships.
B0026ZWHGC|5.0|all the seasons are great, and all the episodes are great, but this one is my favorite.  i have watched it 5 times.  seriously.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|Brilliant Doc...well worth seeing and a real eye opener, makes you think what other incidents have been covered up in the past.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|I first heard of this album by hearing a song in a store. I was in a shopper's haze and the music caught my attention like ordinarily only hearing my children call me can. It justs sounds so new, so fresh. I didn't even know Paul Simon had put out anything new, so I looked it up when I got home. Then I did something I almost never do. I bought a whole album. A whole NEW album. Sight-unseen (or sound-unheard I guess). But I love Paul Simon and I loved what I heard in the store and the risk paid off. I like music that doesn't bore me. I don't like to be taken places where I expect to go. If I can predict the next line or melody, then I am bored and Paul Simon doesn't do that. I understand that the reveiwers that didn't like it claimed to be bored, but I think that is because there is limited 'catchy' melody hooks. For me, when done right, as it is here, this is a good thing. It can take your brain out of that familiar rut feeling and bring it to a new place. If you are looking for Graceland, it isn't here. Yes, it's one of my favorites, too, but can't a guy move on? Paul Simon has clearly grown artistically and it is up to us to catch up.
0743270754|1.0|Aside from the fact that one can point out, as many others have, that the three guys Kearns<br />fingers as \\"essential\\" for winning the war had very little to do with it, Kearns huge<br />mistake, the 800 pound gorilla sitting in the room, is the rather obvious fact that there WAS a<br />civil war, and that it was Lincoln's lack of political genius that guaranteed that it would<br />happen. Knowledgeable historians (that is, those not of the Lincoln cult, e.g. Kearns) know<br />exactly how the civil war came about, and it was 98% a Lincoln creation, with a little help<br />from some clueless Southern politicians. Kearns and Lincoln-cult \\"historians\\" present the Civil War<br />as somehow predestined, mostly because of the slavery issue. But Lincoln certainly didn't attack<br />the Confederate States of America (illegally, without any declaration of war from Congress) to free<br />any slaves.  A \\"political genius\\" who was also President, would not have allowed things to get out<br />of hand to the extent that instead of a few Deep Southern states in secession, who<br />could easily have been subdued, this \\"genius\\" ended up pushing more than twice as many Southerners<br />into the arms of the Confederacy and creating a situation that was the American Tragedy. I've got news for<br />author Kearns : \\"political geniuses\\" are the smart guys, the dopes are called \\"dopes.\\" Lincoln was one<br />huge dope : we have the dead bodies to prove it. And you can't pin the blame on anyone other than Old Abe.<br />Imagine how much better this country would be today if Booth had done his work 4 years earlier.
1439102813|4.0|I would have never read this book if my book club wouldn't have read it. It was very informative and I would recommend it.
034552554X|5.0|This book was gripping, beautiful and touching.  I could not put it down.  This is by far the best book I have read all year. If you are looking for a beautifully-written, intense and hopeful story, this is it.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I turned 11 the year Star Wars came out and saw it 10 times that summer.  I treasure my THX-certified LaserDisc collector's set (though I haven't watched it in years).  I tolerate the changes and modifications that Lucas and co. inject into these films each time they release them.  Count me in if they ever release a Blu-Ray of the original theatrical versions, but in the meantime these are stunning (1080p vs the 480p of the laserdiscs).  I watched Episode III with my son this weekend and Star Wars never looked or sounded better on my humble Blu-Ray/TV.  I understand all the anxiety and even outrage by some fans, but if you just sit back and relax you will enjoy these.  I know I will.
B001IF252M|5.0|Works great. if youre going to use this to play on HDTVmonitor, get minidisplay to HDMI, cos this will not give u the function of HD.

0553801473|5.0|The Song of Ice and Fire is a great series.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to read adult fantasy.  Since each book is over 900 pages expect it to take a while.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Now the storyline and plot of the movie is not that great, I'd give it a 7 out of 10. It's more than watchable in other words. The movie just gets boring after while, and the only thing that might keep you watching is the HOPE of seeing more of Pandora.   Now the Blu Ray quality is awesome, no grain, full 1080p, and the colors really POP in a dark world. Great movie if you are trying to show off your HDTV.
B004V98UKS|3.0|it works, but why are there directional buttons on a tohchscreen game? would be better if the controls were so clumsy.
B000XR4OC0|1.0|I wonder if the rest of these reviewers have had their Toms for more than a month. I too thought these shoes were so stylish and comfortable, and I wore them every day but after less than a month of owning them, they literally fell apart. Holes in the big toe, the canvas at the heel shredding. At first I thought maybe I just walked funny and somehow was scraping the heel on the cement, but now that I read some of these other reviews, it sounds like these are characteristics that everyone should expect out of their Toms. I love the donating a shoe for every shoe purchased, but I honestly feel bad for the poor children who receive their free shoes, because after only a month, they'll be shoeless again. Even if they only cost $20 instead of their outrageous $40+, I would not ever buy Toms again. Not worth it.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Nice multi -level game which makes a lot of fun! The first few levels are easy, but it gets harder as you move on...
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I absolutely can not believe George Lucas and his complete inability to ruin his films by needlessly tinkering with them.Between replacing Sabastian Shaw and this \\"Noooooooo!!\\" garbage i now question Lucas's sanity.Is it his age that brought this on or is he indeed a hack that just happened to get a couple of films right despite the lack of talent?
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I was familiar with the story.  I have read the book.  I have seen other movies with the same title.  Each movie presents the story a little differently.  I thought that this movie did a pretty acurate job. I enjoyed watching it.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I received the Star Wars Blue ray set on the 16th. I convinced my girlfriend to watch episode 4 first because I wanted to see how the oldest movie would look on blue ray. It looked fantastic. We thought the picture was crisp and sharp and the audio was the same. They really did a good job on it.  Fan boy issues aside, I think the set is worth the price. I can't wait to see the rest of the films, although I'll admit, I'm not as big of a fan for the prequels, I still want to see how good they look on blue ray. I also can't wait to explore all the extras that are included. The next weekend or two are going to be fun.      I would just like to add something. If you're going to review the product, how about actually buying the product first then give you're opinions on said product. To give this set 1 or 2 stars before it's released or not even buy it is ridicules.     In my opinion as someone who actually bought the blue ray set, it's dame good and worth the money.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|simple but very addictive. Tightly polished presentation. Quick to learn but the difficulty ramps up to keep it interesting. Five stars.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|First of all, the Blu-ray release is superb in almost every way from a technical standpoint.  The sound and picture are amazing and raise the bar on Blu-ray releases.  However, you need to realize that ALL of the deleted scenes that were on the DVD releases are absent from the Blu Ray release.  To say that this is frustrating is an understatement.  When I preordered this set, I expected a near definitive collection of material in one set along with the material previously released.  This is not the case.    For example, on the Revenge of the Sith DVD, viewers are treated to a deleted scene on the bonus disc of Yoda arriving in exile on Dagobah which was to be included at the end of the film.  This, along with all other previously released deleted scenes are absent from the BluRay set.  It is not in the extras nor is it in any of the documentaries.  In order to highlight this scene's importance, supposedly this scene was released in the European theatrical release and the producer, Rick McCallum, states on the Revenge of the Sith DVD that this scene should have been included in the actual movie.    Where are the original takes of \\"human Jabba\\"?  How could this be omitted?  We saw this before in previous releases.  Why not throw it on one of the nine Blu Ray discs?  What about the previous documentaries and other interviews?  I honestly feel cheated if I have to keep a DVD edition as well as a Blu Ray edition in order to have all of the material.  After basically giving away the DVDs I feel compelled to buy them again in order to have the complete set of extras.      While studios and directors should take note of the technical aspects of this Blu-ray release, they should learn from these blu-ray editions should not leave the customer feeling cheated by their purchase.  Hopefully Spielberg keeps this in mind for the eventual release of the Indiana Jones movies and ET.    ***EDIT***  I want to add one thing.  Take a look at the product description.  Amazon compares theDVD releases with the Blu-ray editions.  If you look at \\"bonus features\\" Amazon states that they are the same as what was released on the DVD then has a listing for new bonus features.  It looks as if Amazon was duped by Lucas as well as the general consumer.
0440241901|3.0|This is the story of a marketing assistant who shares her deepest secrets with a complete stranger (tall, dark, handsome) in an alcohol induced soul baring incident while on a plane.  It turns out that the man is the owner of the company she works for.  Of course, they fall in love after a series of misadventures.  The writing is fine and this is a perfect book for a light breezy read.  Nothing groundbreaking.  Not worthy of discussion at a book club.  Basically this is a guilty pleasure read when all of the heavy books you've been reading are starting to suck the joy of reading out of you and you need to reset your meter.

0634049011|5.0|My neighbor recommended this book to me.  What make this work for me is that I do the written exercises away from the guitar where I can really concentrate on what I am learning.  The pattern approach that this book uses is something I have never seen before, not saying its original to this book, but it works for me.  Would highly recommend this for new guitarists that want to understand what they are doing and learn how to improvise.
0767903862|2.0|I wasn't as fond of this travel book by Bill Bryson.  Granted I've only read one of his others, but at least it was more about the place he was traveling rather than reading like a fact book on the place.<br /><br />This time Bryson is in Australia traveling across and up and down and around the great island continent.  He visits such places as Ayer's Rock (Uluru), the Great Barrier Reef, and other famous locales.  He also stays at some small towns and travels through the wide desert expanse by car.  Bryson doesn't leave cities out either.  He visits most of the big ones and comments on their park areas and accommodations, and sometimes even their food (or lack of places to eat).  I was particularly excited when he mentioned visiting an area that had gigantic worms (up to twelve feet long) as I had never heard of such a thing before.<br /><br />This book though is mostly about Bryson himself.  Indeed, he leaves out a great portion of describing Australia and in turn replaces it with what sort of drink he had at a certain place or other details I really couldn't care about.  The people he describes are mostly ok, but almost seem caricatures of real people.  He almost seems to be fairer to the animals of Australia.<br /><br />For a travel book this read more like a reference book.  In between explaining what beer he had or where he stayed it was filled with history and facts about Australia.  While normally this isn't a bad thing, the result here was that the book was very boring at parts and I had to struggle to keep myself from skimming ahead.  While Bryson claims to like Australia, there was a lot of negative in the book and I just didn't enjoy reading it.  Nor did it make me want to travel there someday.  I would have liked to have read more about the scenery or had more detail on the attractions he visited.<br /><br />Not his best, that's for sure.  I wouldn't really recommend this one to anyone.<br /><br />In a Sunburned Country<br />Copyright 2000<br />304 pages<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011

0439023521|4.0|Not my kind of book that I usually buy but I am glad I did so.     Well written. Pulls you inside the book and you feel what they are going through. A good description of what life under an iron fist could be like and the Gladiator theme/kinda of how people are treated by those in power.     A few parts were bodering on the silly side( very few) but this book is worth the money.
1400052181|5.0|I had to read this book for class, and the way that it was introduced to us I thought it would be primarily a research methods book. When I opened it and started reading I had to make myself put it down because it is so much more! I finished this book in two days. I found myself so engrossed in it that I had forgotten to eat & had to make myself sleep. It is so good. It's informative, and makes me think about life and history in a new way. I'm hoping that someone picks this book up and make it a movie ;-)
B0028KELGE|4.0|This one fell shy of the 5 star rating because the quest to find Freebo was not one of the better moments in the series. And although it later led to some great episodes where the Miguel-Dexter relationship is explored, this particular one is more of a connector than a great stand alone episode.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|Take the unit and put in on the floor in the middle of your play space.  Now, jump up and down on it for a few minutes until it's crushed into a few dozen pieces. You've just wasted 30 bucks, but now you've gotten a little interactive Kinect fun out of it and hopefully you feel a little better.  The Zoom is now just garbage, of course, but it was just garbage before anyway so what's the difference?    How come there's no zero-star rating? This would be perfect for that.

B004V98UKS|5.0|Some people have no patience with waiting until a free app is converted to free.<br /><br />Anyway pretty fun game, barely tried it but going back after this review.<br /><br />Amazon please create an IQ test for people before they can do reviews, just a thought.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Like my title says, I'm surprised how much I like this game.  The idea is simple but the game play is very fun.  I like puzzle games and this game is really a creative and entertaining puzzle type game.  An unexpected bonus was that it has the option to set the graphics quality to low, medium or high and I played on high and it had a very minimal effect on my battery, which as all of us with a smartphone know, is a great feature to any app, much less a game.  I highly recommend this game.
B005GSY23M|5.0|Drive is an experience to be had. I waited to see the film before I reviewed the score because I felt like I needed to experience the sound and image of this film together. I'm glad I did. The effect of the score may be lost upon an unreferenced listen, but let me tell you that Cliff Martinez has done something quite amazing here. Drive is a pure adrenaline rush of a film. Nicolas Winding Refn has crafted a supreme thriller. The music of the film is the most important bonding element of this violent and suspenseful tale. The film is filled with stunning imagery and long duration takes. It also features a seamless soundscape between score and song.<br /><br />Drive has a vintage feel. It feels as if it were made in the 70's but remodeled for modern day. Very much like a beautifully restored vintage car. The character of the driver feels as if he was plucked right out from a spaghetti western. He barely speaks and dons a jacket with a scorpion on the back (very much like El Mariachi's jacket in Desperado). The song choices will be the first thing that the audiences will pay attention to. The songs selected fit the same thematic feel of the movie. They sound like they are 80's hits but are all modern songs with a vivid techno pulse. Cliff Martinez then crafts his stunning score around this universe. The music lacks any graspable structure and is a sonic wash of electronic tones. The way it works in the film is absolutely stunning. I can only describe the music as colorful. There was a point in the film where Ryan Gosling was driving and the sequence was just him driving at night. The shot composition was tight with shallow focus so all you saw was blurs of colors. At that point I felt a rush as the music took over and all you heard were these tones of the night. Cool and crisp, I was able to close my eyes for just a few seconds and see distinct colors as the tones shifted. Martinez also plays the emotions heavy with the relationship between the driver, Irene and Benicio. The score crafts an incredible bubbling tension as well. The way it works with the editing of certain scenes is amazing. Refn is also unafraid to let silence play. A lot of times you will have pockets of pure silence that are broken with a startling sound. The sound design is impeccable and Martinez knows when music is not needed at all. All in all this is a masterful, bold and unique experience.<br /><br />Drive is a rare example of electronic tones working to perfection with the colors and shot composition of the film. This is as tense as it gets; the score and songs MUST be experienced with the film. Do yourself a favor and see the movie before attempting this listen as it will make it the full experience. Cliff Martinez has done so much with so little here and has composed one of the best scores of  the year. This is as untraditional as it gets, but it's oh so good. Damn good.o.

B004V98UKS|5.0|a good puzzle game. gets you thinking with many levels. graphics are decent. controls could use a little more tweak but good enough as they are. can't complain much about something i get for free! works on G2X.  btw, review ratings are there to help people make a decision, not a tool for idiots to disrespect someone's work or how they are presented.
B004LWZW42|5.0|In 20 words was a great movie and worked just fine on my PS3!  I do feel bad for the other people that might have had problems viewing this on the PS3.  I know mine is just the same machine they purchased and mine worked just fine.  Do enjoy  I did! ..
B0052UZIFA|1.0|needs to have survival and puzzle mode like it has on I phone and I pad. and no downlaod over for 4g is very annoying
B004LWZW4C|4.0|I enjoyed this film and I believe this to be the best of the x-men films. The only thing I did not like is that it did seam to cut short Xavier (Prof. X) and Eric's (Magneto) relationship. Other then that it was well scripted, well acted and well directed. I love it when a films based on comics are taken seriously.     The only problem I had with the product itself was that it came with only one disc, the digital copy, it was missing the blu-ray copy of the film. I contacted Amazon I returned it and in two days they sent me a new copy no charge. While not happy with receiving a copy missing a disc, Amazons prompt solution has not deterred me from continued use of the web-site.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Even though GS doesn't display 100% correctly on a Motorola Xoom, it doesn't annoy or get in the way of playing the game. And any little UI glitch is quickly forgiven once you start playing and realize what a clever and interesting game this is. As an earlier reviewer already noted, this will sneakily teach the kids about graph theory, while messing with your head as the bugs scream in terror when the spiders get near them. Every new level makes you want to get the three- stars ' Excellent' reward for the fewest moves, I had to force myself to \\" put the tablet down, back away from the tablet!\\". And all of this for free today, thanks Amazon FAOTD team!
B0053F042G|5.0|I applaud Jake G. and michelle M who I adore for their performance. Every actor was on point and did a great job for this movie. I want to thank the directors and producers for making the best movie of the year in my opinion or one of them (I like limitless too). This movie rocked my world, made me cry and also had a great production from beginning to the end! Whoever wrote and directed thsi movie should definitley be doing so as a career because theya re really good at it! Praise the Lord for an awesome movie! Godbless
B005COO1X6|4.0|Trust King to take an ordinary situation and wham-o: hit you right between the eyes again. For those who think this should have been fleshed out to a book, I seriously disagree. It would have been another \\"It\\" or \\"Tommyknockers\\".  Lots of description for a disappointing and totally unbelievable ending. Yes, you can say that about most of his unrealistic stories, but in most cases, his reasoning is plausible, and it's easy to suspend disbelief, and this was one of those.    Very enjoyable read.
B005KAH7QU|4.0|All in all it was ok. Nothing spectacular but not awful in any way either. I rated a 4 because it was more good than bad
B002EEP3NO|5.0|If you're kids are Star Wars fans (or their dad is a Star Wars nerd) you will enjoy the time spent on this unbelievable set, just make sure you allow for a lot of it. LEGO put a huge amount of detail into the Death Star and it is very well made. The set is very durable. The kids play on it all the time and I've had very few pieces fall off that couldn't easily be repaired. It is now the centerpiece of my kids play area (and all the kids in the neighborhood think it's \\"so cool\\").<br /><br />One word of advice; I had read several other reviews and the most common negative thing was that the big laser canon (green cone shaped one)is rather flimsy and falls apart. After I saw it for myself and put it together once I decided to pull it all apart and crazy glue the pieces that make up the satellite dish (the part the green pieces attach to). This has made all the difference in the world. The kids haven't broken the laser once.<br /><br />If you have kids who enjoy Lego this is the ultimate gift. Additionally, my boys and I built it together and it gave us a lot of time to spend together during assembly.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Liam neelson's unknown. Another big hit! Not his best but this movie is definitley entertaining! Worth the $4 for watching it!
B004X4QW42|3.0|The first movie is awesome-five stars, a classic I can watch over and over.  The second one is not up to par with the first, but definitely worth seeing (but I wouldn't need to see it again).  Basic story: IP man survives being shot by the Japanese and sets up a fighting school in Hong Kong after the war.  He has to fight through the bureaucracy of the other martial art schools and the corruption of the British while struggling to feed is family and pay his rent.  Yes, the fighting is awesome and Donny Yen is once again spectacular as IP man.  However, the other characters in this movie are not nearly as complex or likable as in the first.  Specifically, the British characters are incredibly cartoonish.  The corrupt police officer looks and acts like he stepped out of the funny pages.  The World champion boxer is also laughable as a character, totally one dimensional.  It reminded me of Rocky IV when Rocky fought the Russian (they made him into a machine and completely un-redeemable as a human that there was nothing relatable).  Also, I had a problem with the idea that a boxer could even stand in the same ring with these martial art masters.  To me that seems ridiculous.  So, overall a solid movie worth watching but I didn't find it as spectacular as the first (which I love watching again and again).  Hope this helps!
B005DD7H50|5.0|THIS YEAR'S BEST MOVIE! A PLUS. THEY SHOULD MAKE A SEQUEL. I HAVE SEEN COUNTLESS MOVIES AND THIS ONE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN1` I WATCHED IT 3 TIMES IN 48 HOURS BECAUSE IT'S THE BOMB! CONRATULATIONS BRAD COOP. I DON'T EVEN LIKE HIM BUT HE DID A WONDERFUL JOB!
B0041928UG|4.0|Tom Wolfe doesn't hold back on punctuation and it made me feel like he was next to me telling me this story. I also listened to a bit of it on audio and it was really good too.    The book is about class issues in New York. Masters of the Universe versus ghetto kids. Great read.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|Was just a really decent inspiring. HOPE FILLED cinematic feature! Hollywood needs more movies about love, inspiration, hope and God! WOW! props and blessin for the person who wrote this! If you want to watch it i recommend it!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|A good puzzle game where it doesn't involve luck to be able to get 3 star completions. I do however have a new level of dislike for spiders...
B0018BB20W|5.0|this needs no review - it is simply a pivotal icon of modern music - soaring,thoughtful and riveting and technically marvelous from an age where simple talent and relatively primative recording technology was all anyone had to work with
B002G1K82Q|2.0|When actors try to become professional singers, the results are usually disappointing.  In \\"Across the Universe\\" they try too hard, hoping that the audience will be impressed with their singing.  Their renditions are too self-conscious, too forced.  It would have been better to use professional (talented) singers, rather than trying to turn actors into quality singers.
B004V98UKS|5.0|I may be the first so here goes. Graphics are good, music is soothing (not that terrible rock stuff usually used). Game play is normal suduko type, good to waste time while waiting somewhere. Seems to have quite a few levels, thanks Amazon for these free apps!
0316067598|3.0|Though Mr. Luttrell has a unique story and a perspective that most of us will never gain first-hand, this book is marred by poor writing. Many small facts and details are repeated in different parts of the book when one mention would have sufficed, while other things, like the author's age at the time of the events, are not given. Certain important topics (like ROE, public perception of the military, media coverage of armed conflict, the history of the Pashtun people) are not condensed into cohesive discussions or examples of his points. Instead, more about these topics keeps showing up after they had been dealt with earlier. Or the reverse occured, with a tiny unanchored statement made, then not fleshed out until much later. These, unfortunately, give the flavor of a rant to what is, underneath, important material.      The first half of the book jumps jerkily from topic to topic: from childhood vignettes, to background information about the war, to the ins and outs of SEAL training, to the problems with today's liberal media, to what is visibile out the window of the helicopter, to the author's comraderie with the men he serves with, to the equipment his carrying, to what he and his friends think of the president. It feels cut and pieced together in a way that is distracting and reads like an unfinished product. Once Operation Redwing gets under way, the story stays more focused, but still strays at times. Why the rather extraordinary history and experience of this man weren't given a more rigorous streamlining by his experienced co-author and editor, I'll never know.     Lastly, I didn't feel there was a satisfactory explanation for why Luttrell was so sure the three goatherds had betrayed his team's presence. Since this was a pivotal point in how he felt about the outcome of the mission and all that followed, it should have been stated more directly. As it stands, he actually makes a good argument for why and how Sharmack's men could have found him on their own.
1594744769|4.0|Miss Peregrine's is an unusual book in that the photos provide strong support for the story. They are nice but not perfect props as they were acquired over time at flea markets and other odd venues and then use to put together this fun story. I believe this is the author's first novel but it feels well made. The hero goes to a remote European island to learn more about fantastic stories told by his recently deceased grandfather. To his surprise, they are true and he is now in charge of helping protect a time-travel like place with his grandfather's classmates/roommates still these and still young. This book reminded me of Harry Potter, Big Fish, and Lemony Snicket's \\"A Series...\\". It is set up for a sequel as it ends with \\"...and we rowed faster.\\"
0823003590|4.0|I did get a lot out of this book. He does discuss his approach and techniques --even shows you how to sharpen your pencil (which is not the page-waster it sounds like). One problem: he wants you to use a particular paper --strathmore velvet gray--that none of the local art stores around here carry.   And with shipping and minimum sheet orders you will likely fork out another $30 just to get the required paper. Your best bet may be to take the book to the art store to see if you can get a match. (No one around here came close-- and we have some large art stores.)
B004V98UKS|3.0|I installed this on my Viewsonic gtab, rooted with Flasback 7.1. It installed fine, loaded, came up to menu screen, and I tried changing the nickname, but the keyboard was off. i had to try to find the right letters off the keyboard. then into game play, everything appeared fine until the actual play when everything was a jumbled mess. i couldnt play it. i give the stars i did because the graphics and future game play looks nice. plus it could be my honeycomb rom. i hope future updates will include the tablets, honeycomb, or something i can play.
0823016714|2.0|I was disappointed in this book.  The small photos are certainly varied, but the expressions are far from subtle.  It's chief value would be for someone drawing cartoons or anime.
0307716511|5.0|This is a splendidly beautiful novel with a thrilling story.  Absolutely loved it! One of the best books I've ever read!
0896898288|3.0|The stories and the blocks are a very interesting part of our history.  The templates provided print out one per page and are usually not correct even then.  Friends had to use Electric Quilt 6 and modify that to get paper piecing templates to make this easier.  Some friends redrafted the blocks and then the blocks came out great then.  If you like a bit of a challenge, this is the book for you.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This version is not the old StarWars. Why is Darth Vader talking in the scene helping his son? I don't understand George Lucas. The authentic movie is awesome, please, don't change it!
B004V98UKS|3.0|Its a simple puzzle game that has been done many times before. Looks clean and the gameplay is fine. But the controls are very unwieldy and somewhat clunky to use. Still, a decent game
0446563048|5.0|This book is awesome! Definitely a read for those who are wanting motivation to create a different culture in their workplace.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|I saw this at the theater and it is highly entertaining. Great cinematography. Funny movie. Not uproariously funny, but still funny. It is a great story. With Woody Allen writing and creating a movie about what-if-we-could-go-back-in-time and spend that time in the company of the great writers and artists of the past.  And of course the setting. Paris. Brilliantly filmed. And of course the funny dialogue.  I plan on buying a copy for myself and a family member as soon as amazon puts it up for sale here.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Well done, creative, simple and fun to play.  I recommend it.  Hours of play and worth the $0.99. Get it for sure.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I bought this as a present for my wife. She is absolutely rapt with it, especially the additional included goodies (postcards and particularly the music box). The product was originally programmed to arrive in October but got here last week. Most impressed!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This version is awesome in picture and sound quality. The bonus discs are the best part for sure. I love the films for what they are so that is why i now own them in blu ray. That is basically how i feel about it. Great buy, either you love Star Wars or you dont.
3257229534|4.0|it is very good to purchased this item at Amazon.com.  I like the book, it is nearly brand now, thanks.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Simple concept, gets very challenging later on especially if you want to collect all three stars, but most levels aren't too tough to get past if you just feed the alien and continue on to the next level. So it shouldn't be too frustrating for the kids.
0553801473|3.0|seriously some elements in book 5 really reminded me of the wheel of time... this dude needs some original thought. i did love ht first 3 books tho.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|I love these headphones for the approximate year I used them as my first professional-grade studio monitors. Their accuracy, clarity, detail, and well-represented spectrum of sound always impressed me. Even better, it would be hard for me to imagine a more comfortable pair of headphones than the 7506's, I could wear them for hours on end and completely forget I was wearing them. However, after about one year of VERY gentle use, one ear pad has ripped at a seam and detached itself from the unit, and the other ear pad is starting to go the same route. I read somewhere the ear pads are replaceable for ~$10, but honestly, I don't want to keep funding a pair of headphones that I have to keep repairing as frequently as once a year. For that reason alone, I've migrated to a pair of KRK 8400's and won't look back. They're nearly as comfortable, but even more detailed and refined than the 7506's, and seem significantly more durably built as well. Check my review on that product page if interested. The 7506's will always be the pair of headphones that introduced me into accurate/pro-level reference monitoring which gives them my respect, but quality of workmanship is key to loyalty. Sorry Sony.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Who didn't love the original Star Wars movies? Lucas has steadily ruined them against his own fans/customer's wishes and the latest Blu-ray release with it's 'improvements' only added insult to injury after promised corrections that never came.<br /><br />It's bad enough were stuck with Jar Jar, yet various other key scenes remain edited and ruined, or only fixed partially with a single frame fixed out of several giving a sloppy impression of the editing that was done.<br /><br />Given their track record, there will probably be yet another 1-2 more Blu-ray box set releases yet none will ever truly be fixed or give the series back to the fans.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|Good concept fun game but looks like a pile of poo on a tablet. Why any developer makes an application size specific is beyond me.
0553240749|3.0|The book was shipped very quickly, and I appreciate that so much. This was required reading for my daughter, who is a freshman in high school. I also appreciated the fact that it was much more economical, than purchasing a new copy. The book was a little rough, as far as appearance goes, but it is definitely usable! Thank you!
B001PJRAUS|4.0|Loved it! I love anything Jane Austen and this was really cute - a young woman travels back to Pride And Prejudice times and creates all kinds of havoc.
0385534639|3.0|This book has a great story line with a wonderful plot. The descriptions of the circus were amazing and you truly felt as though you were there. The only two issues I had with it were:    - the characters/settings jumped around a bit. by the end of the novel, you had no idea how old any of the characters were and the chapter years jump around way too much    - because this was only one novel, the character development was nice as far as historical ideas, but the true magic and how it was done was never discussed.    i was so excited to read it as the storyline was truly capturing, however, it just didnt live up to my expectations. although, it was a clever idea and an entertaining read.
B004V98UKS|2.0|Game would be ok if it wasn't for the awful touchscreen controls. Seems like most of the difficulty is in getting the controls to do what you want them to do.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this story.  I'm on my second read of it because I've enjoyed it that much.  Simply brilliant!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is a great time waster game. It's not haed to figure out how to play, and not too easy.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I absolutely love this story.  Characters are complex, story tugs at your emotions, and the intimacy is hot.  Buy it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Where oh where is &#34; Seawead Brain&#34;? When Jason wakes up on a bus holding TOTALLY hot girls hand Dylan turns into a storm spirit and trys to kill the 3, uh, special kids.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|As an enthusiastic newbie to the Firefly franchise, I was extremely glad to find this movie; it gives a bit of closure while leaving the door open to more. The subtitles are unusually good, and most of the (generous) extra stuff is subtitled as well, which is highly unusual. Bravo!!!
1600108512|5.0|Fast, neat delivery. My daughter and i love the story, surprised to see the detail done in comic style layout-drawings are awesome!
B002XMGGJM|5.0|I was completely surprised by how good this movie was. I have to say it ranks up there with Taken in action and suspense. I would highly recommend this movie!
B004SIMNF0|5.0|Alright, I've never actually been a cowboy before, but...<br /><br />I was looking for a belt solution for my Canon 7D with the attached battery grip. I needed it to be comfortable, quick and secure. The options I considered were the Cotton Carrier Carry-Lite, Spider Holster and the Bgrip. They each offer a slightly different setup, and after reading a ton of reviews online, I decided to buy the B-Grip. After a couple of months and a couple dozen photoshoots, I wasn't happy. It distributed the weight in a manner that was very uncomfortable to me.<br /><br />Just last month, I folded my hand and purchased the SpiderPro Holster... WOW!  This belt solution is amazing and exactly what I needed. It is just totally awesome! Hopefully you find this review helpful. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them at the end of this review. The opinions of this review are of my own as a consumer who paid full retail price for this product. I am not affiliated or compensated in anyway by any of the companies mentioned in this review. I'm just a photographer who is looking for good equipment.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Comfortable - The belt has enough padding and width to make it feel like it isn't even there. The area where the camera rests against you is stiff enough so you don't feel anything. It distributes the weight of my 6-9 pound camera evenly across my waist and hips. Compared to the B-Grip, the SpiderPro moves the point of downward force closer to your body, resulting in less torque and more comfort.<br />* Quick - I feel like a cowboy! The Spider Pin slides in and out of the holster clip as fast as you can move it. I have experienced a couple of times when the lock wouldn't release easily. Now that I've been using it every day, it has loosened up and is now one fluid motion. Drawing and holstering the camera becomes an intuitive muscle memory in a very short period of time. Compared to the B-Grip, you have the option doing this with only one hand.<br />* Secure - Originally I was concerned about the camera slapping around or banging into things. But the way it a hangs, it doesn't move much at all when I walk. The locking latch also secures the camera from bouncing up out of the clip.<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Price - This is one of the more expensive options, but it is worth every dollar. The quality is top notch.<br />* Buckle - The belt buckle takes two hands and one hard press to detach. While this makes it super secure, it is also kind of a pain. It would have been nice to see am easier system offering the same security with less hand strength required.<br />* Profile - You may find you need to turn sideways to squeeze through a crowd as this does add a few extra inches to your hip. When in tight situations, I either unclip it or rotate the position of the camera to the front or back. If you can live with that, this is perfect, if you can't get the Cotton Carrier baby bjorn.<br /><br />TIPS:<br />* Dry Lube - I found an article somewhere online saying that it is a good idea to lubricate the ball of the Spider Pin and slide it in and out of the clip a few times. I used just a smidge of Finish Line DRY Teflon Lube for bicycle chains and that worked well enough.<br />* Hip Pouch - I pair this belt up with my Think Tank Speed Changer. It holds a couple of lenses, Expo Disc, ColorChecker, LensPen, business cards, pens and anything else I need to stash within reach. Having this added accessory allows me to work faster and shoot easier on location or in the studio.the camera slapping around or banging into things.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Best movie I've seen on Blu Ray in terms of visual effects. After watching this movie on blu ray, I decided to commit to nothing but blu ray for most of my movie purchases. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0061914177|5.0|I've just finished my second reading of \\"Why Now Is The Time To Crush It!\\" Does that mean I like it? You bet your sweet a#$ I do. Gary Vaynerchuk rocks. His understanding of the power of the Internet and Social Media are second to none. His style is both refreshing, without pretense and his book(s) are dead on. I have recommended his books to the executives at our company and have even suggested that he be a keynote at our Annual Conference.
B005EVVPUE|3.0|It was good to see this great concert again but must admit to a slight disappointment at the remastering. I would not have noticed any difference whatever with the quality of picture, and considering I played it on my Sony blu -ray player using HDMI cable I was expecting a lot more. I am no tech whiz but was thinking it would have been good to remove a lot of the flair ups and bleeding of image that happens due to Freddy's franting running around the stage. Still, to get the complete concert on cd as well makes this a good way to purchase this concert film.<br />The dvd extras are nothing new either: the rehearsal footage I have already seen attached to the Queen On Fire dvd...go figure!
B00006GA48|5.0|Great purchase my husband loves it, it was a gift for him. What a blast from the past, you can't get god music like this anymore!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|this game is just as addictive and frustrating as angry birds. i can't put it down. i got it when it was a free app but it is definitely worth $.99!
B0034G4P8A|4.0|With Kenneth Branagh at the helm, it's hard not to draw comparisons between THOR and various Shakespearean tragedies: brash, arrogant son defies his father, bringing about apocalyptic consequences, only to find that he was betrayed by those whom he trusted most.  It's an age-old story, which works in THOR's favor: it lends the film a firm sense of ethos, a grand backdrop which Branagh manipulates with great skill.<br /><br />It helps that he's chosen a fine cast.  Chris Hemsworth has solid screen presence; the film sags a bit when Thor loses his powers, but picks up admirably when he regains them.  Throughout, Hemsworth remains, at his worst, watchable, and at his best, thoroughly engaging.  As the devious Loki, Tom Hiddleston is a devious, manipulating wonder (stick around after the credits for what is arguably his best scene).  Anthony Hopkins finally has a role he can sink his teeth into again, and Stellan Skarsgard scores as a doubtful scientist.  Natlie Portman doesn't have a whole lot to do, but she does it well; same with Kat Dennings, who provides some of the film's necessary comic relief.  Clark Gregg is back as smarmy Agent Coulson, and Idris Elba has a grand bit part as a loyal gatekeeper.  Also look for: Ray Stevenson as a Norse warrior; Rene Russo as Thor's mother; Colm Feore as a menacing Ice Giant king; and Jeremy Renner in a thoroughly bada** cameo.<br /><br />THOR definitely has its flaws, number one being its utter implausibility.  It's hard to bring the mystical wonder of comic books to the big screen; comic fans are much more willing to suspend disbelief than the average film-goer (though the popularity of such films as TWILIGHT and the TRANSFORMERS franchise says otherwise...).  Branagh doesn't try to convince us that all this is real; that tactic works great with heroes such as Batman, but when you're dealing with the Norse god of thunder, it's best to just shrug it off by having your hero declare: \\"Your ancestors called it magic; you call it science.  Where I come from, they're one and the same.\\"  Branagh goes for the implausible epic; he doesn't succeed (to keep audiences interested, the film has to clock in under 2 hours, and it's hard to do an epic is such a short time), but it's a noble effort, and makes for one of the more entertaining superhero movies of late.  Not quite as good as IRON MAN, say, but a few steps above IRON MAN 2 or THE GREEN LANTERN.  It's refreshing to see a comic book film that isn't an origin story, or doesn't try to rewrite \\"history.\\"  It's simply a straightforward film, featuring a solid cast, helmed by a reliable filmmaker.  If that's what you're in the mood for, it doesn't get much better than THOR.e from, they're one and the same.\\"  Branagh goes for the implausible epic; he doesn't succeed (to keep audiences interested, the film has to clock in under 2 hours, and it's hard to do an epic is such a short time), but it's a noble effort, and makes for one of the more entertaining superhero movies of late.

B004R6JG7G|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I'm not going to bore anybody to tears with a complete, two page technical breakdown of every single aspect of this Blu-ray release (not that there's anything wrong with that). All I know is I saw a DVD being demoed at a Bose store and was blown away by the sound of that opening scene on the carrier. Got the DVD for myself and was quite disappointed with it. I think it was better when I rented it on VHS way back when. Copped the \\"Special Edition\\" for $6 when it was released, and it was better, but the audio still came up short on the surround sound. Well, took one more shot with the Blu-ray+Digital Copy... YES!! Opening scene was super, shook the whole house. I thought the picture was great, typical hi-def picture quality, plus all the extras that are included definitely give you your money's worth (10 bucks, order it now!). If you are a fan of Top Gun and want the Blu-ray, you can't miss with this one.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|Fits nicely on the 18-55 mm VR Nikkor lens. Can be reversed and mounted on the lens when not in use. Good quality lens hood. Does a good job in blocking unwanted light.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|the app works as it should. although I wish it would allow changing default storage locations.  however the music selection and the fact that music cost less than competitive services make up for.any shortcomings.
B004JC16LC|5.0|This is a behemoth of a set; 14.5 x 5.0 x 6.0 inches of Furtwangler! I have dabbled my way through about 30 of the 107 (plus DVD and CD-ROM) discs here, mostly the recordings I have not heard before. All of them sound great given their age and the circumstances under which they were made. A few quibbles: I would have liked to have had the La Scala Wagner Ring complete, rather than 2 discs of excerpts; these two excerpt discs prove the La Scala performances to be superior to the (included complete) RAI Rome ones, though the Rome recordings DO have superior sound. Also, much as I love the Bayreuth 1951 Beethoven 9, I love the 1942 9th, and other wartime Beethoven recordings (a few excerpts are included on the \\"bonus\\" discs). Of course, I already have those sets, so this is just quibbling. This set is all the Furtwangler neophyte needs until they become a fanatic about it and \\"need\\" to become OCD completists (which, ironically, is why I bought this set). The long (literally) and short of it is, this is a fantastic box set at a great price, organized REALLY well in sturdy boxes. Even if you have half of these recordings in other incarnations, this set is STILL a deal!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|This game will keep you occupied for hours. Not too difficult if you are into strategy games, but still challenging.
0525425578|5.0|Excellant series by Grisham for young readers.  The main characters are school children but the writing is in no way childish.  All you need to know about our court systems and trials without feeling like a class assignment.  Start with the first in series \\"Kid Lawyer\\" and you will be hooked.  Highly recommended.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I will not be verbose with this review.  Hands down the CD is perfect, from production to performance!  Congratulations to Anthrax for writing a spectacular album.  IT IS A MUST BUY!

0060567503|5.0|An absolutely awesome read for anyone in sales or management, I suggest this book to all new and tenured reps.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucas really needs to realize that the movies belong to the fans, and not to him.  He may be the creator, but he owns them just as much as Da Vinci owns the Mona Lisa.   What he is doing is akin to someone magic markering eyebrows onto ol' Mona.     I for one will not be buying this, maybe renting if cheap.      That being said, growing up I watched the originals at least once a month.  Loved just sitting back and enjoying them, even RotJ.  Watched them countless times and never got bored; enjoyed each viewing like it was the first.   With that in mind, I have sat all the way through the Phantom Menace once, Attack twice, and Revenge once, and that is enough for me.  In fact, since the prequels came out, I have only watched the originals a couple of times.  Lucas has lost whatever magic he once had.   It is time to let go of the reins and let someone else take over.  (though he has said on numerous occasions, he will not).
B004HO6I4W|3.0|Colorful and nicely animated, 'Rio' suffers from a boring plot line and mediocre music and songs. One can see how overwhelming this film must have been in theaters in 3D, but at home, in flat 2D, the film is a disappointment from the usually fine Blue Sky team.  The film starts with promise with a prologue that introduces us to the main characters of Blu the macaw who cannot fly and Linda, a typical heroine from animation land who we all know will somehow end up in a bikini for Rio's carnival. The opening musical sequence of colorful birds set to Brazilian music is promising but the viewer will be disappointed to discover that, except for the end credits, that is the last you will see of such dancing antics and music. The remaining musical numbers are uninspiring and the use of two bird companions who rap and hip hop seems strangely out of place in a film supposedly set in Brazil. Definitely on the low end of 2011's animated films but kids will not care if you park them in front of the TV to watch this colorful and fast paced film. Adults who like animation should give it a pass.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Love it. Will not be plying angry birds now that I have this game. Great graphics and game play. The best
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I was exceptionally pleased with the product and how rapidly I received the CD.  Now, I'm happily enjoying the music.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Vender had good price and shipped the movie right away.  Transaction went very well and the movie was in good conditions.  Would buy from them again.    Good Movie - Who would think that you could make a movie of a train rolling down a track that would keep your attention.  Believe me it kept my full attention.  No one in the room said a peep.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I really enjoy Pat's writing, and find the story of Kvothe compelling, however, books must lead somewhere in a timely fashion.  If Tolkien's LOtR followed this same timeline, we'd be 2 books in and only just now leaving Hobbiton... I hope that Mr. Rothfuss at least pulls the car out of the driveway next time...
034552554X|5.0|Loved this novel by Vanessa Diffenbaugh.  The story is an extremly enjoyable read; very heartwarming, sad and moving.  Learning about the language of flowers was so interesting to me and loved how the language was woven through the story.    I finished this story two weeks ago and still think about the characters, (a sign of a great novel).  \\"The Language of Flowers\\" is a must read, it may just be my favorite of 2011.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|fun to play, good graphics, easy to hit the wrong web tho if u have sausage fingers.  very challenging and entertaining puzzle game to play when u have a few free minutes.
0385732554|5.0|How would we react to a perfectly organized world? This story gives us a glimpse of what that would be like. We meet the characters and learn what moves them or what doesn't. At first we accept the world as it is, just like Jonas and his family. We wait to see a little deeper into this society and when we do, through Jonas' memory transfers, we see its grevious faults. We are rewarded by Jonas' heroism and his great sacrifice to reach something better.    The reader is moved through the plot at a steady pace. Suspicion is built slowly as Jonas' crisis of conscience is revealed. We grieve with him and rejoice with him when he chooses his path. It is a very satisfying read.
B002ZG980U|5.0|The first time I saw Inception, I left the theatre a little confused but I had enjoyed the movie. The second time I saw it, I had many aha moments. The third time, it all fell into place. Because Inception is sooo good, I didn't mind watching it multiple times. Kinda like The Matrix, but different. The dream within a dream within a dream concept is fascinating and the movie's special effects are awesome. Good story, good characters. One of my faves.
1423113454|2.0|The story moves quickly through the plot. However, it keeps moving and moving, not giving the reader time to breathe. Scenes jump from one crisis to another without giving the reader a grounding in reality that would allow the reader to accept the suspension of belief. No clear explanation is given how all the magic is done in front of people on the street without creating a panic. The airport scene offers something, but it isn't enough. Overall, it was hard to accept the premise that 2 teenagers could become proficient in magic and supernatural power so quickly.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|i am a massive gaga fan so of course i was thrilled to have born this way but i have to say putting my fanaticism aside and looking at it from a purely musical perspective it is a phenomenal work of art.  to have so many different sounds not only just on one track but throughout every track on the whole album is almost unheard of.  i don't believe anyone working today has the creativity or involvement in their own music that gaga has.  i love the entire album and can't imagine it without the three tracks that are not available on the regular version.  you must buy the deluxe to really get a full picture of what born this way has to offer.  some of my personal favorites are government hooker, bloody mary, heavy metal lover but all are excellent and this is hands down the best album i've purchased all year.
B004V98UKS|5.0|but the first time I clicked on it, it did say .99 cents. first time it ever happened to me in 4-5 months. hit my 'back' button on my phone, tried it again, and it was free! so if it ever happens to you, try again! and wait a good half hour after 12pst! THANKS AMAZING, I MEAN, AMAZON!! AMAZING AMAZON YAY!!! Just remember, those of us with brains appreciate what you do! :D The brainless ones who have no life and nothing else to do are the ones who come here time and time again to make their negative comments heard. This is my second comment in 4-5 months because I actually have other # to do, its called havin a life! lol :D
B000063UR1|5.0|Bruce Dern was never given the opportunity to show what a great actor he was.  Silent Running will be known as the B-movie with a star from an A-movie line.  Great story with before its time robotics.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|Love the Blu-Ray treatment the StarWars Saga has just received.  Just one problem.  It is a repeat of Avatar.  The discs have issues playing on a HTPC using both PowerDVD 11 and ArcSoft TrueMedia Theater 5.  Both companies are stating a update is in the works.  My rating is only on 20th Century Fox's Decision to hurt the customer by updating Anti-Copy.  Sad thing is I was able to copy the discs and convert them to H.264 1080P files that Played flawlessly.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Alright, we need to simplify what people's problems with this set are. It apparently isn't the quality of the video (for the most part) or audio, which is what blu-ray enthusiasts care about and is what I ultimately bought a high-def tv and surround sound system for. It's basically the fact that George Lucas did not restore the theatrical versions of the original trilogy for blu-ray and only gave us slightly modified special edition versions with this set.     By now you already know what was changed, and there are some things which probably shouldn't have been touched, but they were and there's nothing we can do about it at this time. Now the question we have to ask ourselves is do we care more about the Star Wars experience on blu-ray, the medium that gives us the ultimate home theater experience, or are we so determined to stand by our convictions that the theatrical cuts should be included that we will shun this set and wait until it's released with the original theatrical cuts?    The answer to this question is actually simple, and it took me having to watch the original theatrical cuts on dvd to realize how ridiculous my original reaction was. As I watched these great movies on my 50\\" Pioneer Elite in Dolby 2-channel stereo, I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed in some way. I have this amazing home theater system, and these original theatrical cuts, with their grainy picture, black outlines around the special effects, and 2-channel stereo, which still sounded great for only 2 channels, simply don't give us the home theater experience we hoped for when we purchased all these expensive components. I began to realize that even if these versions were restored for blu-ray, it would look horrible because the level of detail on blu-ray would expose all the limitations in the special effects of that day. These cuts were meant for a lesser medium, like dvd or laser disc, where they could still showcase detail, but not enough where the limitations would be obvious anddistracting. And what is the point of Dolby Stereo, which was the original theatrical audio source, on blu-ray? Sure the special editions were widely criticized for the many changes that were made, but one thing is for sure, even though the special effects of 1997 seem dated compared to today's special effects, they are leaps and bounds ahead of the special effects from 1977, 1980, and 1983, and undoubtedly showcase on blu-ray better than the theatrical cuts ever would.    What seems to be apparent when you read all the negative reviews is that people are just angry at George Lucas for the changes he's made to his works over the years. I agree it seems annoying for him to make so many changes, but this is his story, Luke Skywalker is his version of himself in his sci-fi fantasy, and he went through a lot to simply get the original movie made. Star Wars doesn't just belong to him, and it doesn't just belong to the fans who made it popular, it belongs to everyone, and it is available in so many different formats to please all these different people. This blu-ray set was made for the people who want the ultimate Star Wars experience, and this is the ultimate experience that George Lucas envisioned himself. He made some changes to try to make it perfect for blu-ray, and sometimes we try a little too hard to make things perfect when they already are, but he's not doing it to make the fans angry, he's doing it FOR the fans, because he wants them to see the vision that he saw in his mind over 35 years ago. I don't know why people get so angry at him for that, without George Lucas we would not have this legendary work of art. It's still available in it's original form on dvd, but George Lucas is providing us with something he believes is better, something he believes is the pinnacle of the Star Wars experience, and I think that's awesome. I haven't even bought the set yet because I simply don't have the money, but as soon as I do, I will add this blu-ray set to my collection.    So if you want the ultimate Star Wars experience, this is it, and if you want to see the original theatrical cuts, you still can on dvd, and they're just as, if not more, entertaining as the special editions. You have to come to accept that if you want the original Star Wars theatrical experience, it's simply not blu-ray caliber, and if you want the ultimate Star Wars experience, it's going to be different than what you remember, but it's still Star Wars, and it's still as amazing as ever. People have this expectation that somehow we can create this perfect version of Star Wars that pleases George Lucas and the fans, but that will never happen, and that is why they've given us so many different versions. So decide for yourself whether you want the blu-ray experience with what many reviewers say is the greatest home audio experience and the best picture you've ever seen from Star Wars, or whether you want to stick to your guns and your laser disc and dvd versions just because they are the original theatrical cuts. When you think about it, this argument is trivial, if you love blu-ray and Star Wars, just buy it, and most likely you won't regret it.
B002JYPV3G|5.0|Things I don't like about the album: well you see the very cool packaging on display? Well that's cardboard. Not very sturdy cardboard either so it's very easy to damage. And then there was puking. I'm referring to the bonus feature. It begins by showing the most disgusting and drawn out puking session I've ever seen in my life (honestly). But that aside...It's Slipknot!!! This is simply there most unrelenting album ever. The music Slipknot makes lately has been a lot slower and softer. This album includes no such song. It just tears your face off. A lot of the bonus songs are just remixes (interesting remixes though), but what's not a remix is very good, so it warrants paying extra for the special edition. Overall, I'm a happy customer.
B004SBX112|5.0|Any person who gives this a one star rating are morons who do not know how to operate their phones
B002436WJE|5.0|Taken was never a movie,as a woman, I thought I would enjoy,but I was wrong.  My first impression was oh no another car chasing needless violence movie,again wrong.  To me it was the first interesting movie that contained those elements,but balanced out with real excellent acting from the everyone involved.    For entertainment I would recommend this movie(even for women) for people who want to see a dvd with the total entertainment package.  I learned don't judge a dvd by its cover!!!Enjoy
030726999X|5.0|Great finish to a great series. I loved the first, found the second a bit more of a struggle at times, although when it was good, it was really good. This finale was a great way to finish.
B0059IVV9M|3.0|I love all of Beirut's music and this album doesn't stand out.  I am not looking for melodic gingles in my preferences, but this album doesn't seem as unique as the others.  Not to say its bad, it's a worthy album and enjoyable, but it's thrown into my music mix verse listening to the album start to finish.  If you are new to Beirut, start with a different album.  If you enjoy Beirut, this is worthwhile, but it didn't amaze or interest me beyond being mildly entertaining.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|Heritage offers some amazing, often beautiful music that I'm fighting slightly mixed feelings about as I try to give it the appreciation it deserves.  The classic Opeth sound is present in most of the album's songs, but it's disguised by new methods of delivery.  In fact, the more I listen to it, the more I hear the old Opeth in there, with Mikael's trademark style of playing translated through various channels; haunting folk (I Feel the Dark), Sabbath or Deep Purple-inspired doom (Famine), jazzy Primus-style funk (Nepenthe), stoner rock (Slither), and so on.  And when I try to imagine what I'm hearing played with heavy, death metal distortion and growling vocals, I hear songs that could easily have been written in the band's old style...but for this album, were given full prog makeovers.  Some people will love it, given that they still hear the core Opeth sound, while for others it won't quite satisfy given the complete absence of death metal.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of people online express the hope that Opeth only goes with the new style for this one album, and while I wouldn't mind that, for now I'm enjoying almost all of what this release has to offer.  However, being a big fan of all the previous Opeth material, I can't help feeling at least a little hesitant about fully embracing Heritage not knowing if this is a permanent change.  If they released, say, a companion \\"heavy\\" album, as with Deliverance and Damnation, maybe more of the older fans would be heaping as much praise on this as they did Damnation, knowing they still have the heavier side of the band to enjoy.  Heritage does have a much harder edge than Damnation, just not through heavy, distorted guitars or death metal vocals, and I'm actually finding it pretty easy to get into.  It has so much diversity, such a variety of instrumentation, styles, and moods.  The songs are rich with atmosphere, and instead of offering ballad after ballad, which is my only mild complaint with Damnation (and just my opinion, I still wore out my copy of that CD), it often picks up the pace and gets heavy at choice moments.  Maybe Opeth will return to their traditional sound on the next one, maybe not, but if Mikael is lacking inspiration to create amazing metal music right now, I'd much rather have this than a half-hearted attempt to recreate Blackwater Park.I still wore out my copy of that CD), it often picks up the pace and gets heavy at choice moments.

0803726570|5.0|Great story of inclusion and fun. I was a little nervous about the scary factor with the 'monster' against the dragon, but showed the support of the animals of THEIR witch, great togetherness, in a non-violent way.  It's one of our new favorites!
B005E8KQPM|2.0|I love progressive rock but not from Opeth.  The key gripe here is that I liked Opeth because it WAS progressive METAL.  There are so many bands that already sound like this release...and dare I say better?  I get that not all artists want to do metal all their career, and even understand they may want to experiment with sound. But to me without Opeth's signature sound they sound  like Riverside, Anathema, or Katatonia.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this but this feeling of disappoint won't go away.  Thus, though I would be open to the music that I normally listen to, what I liked about Opeth is gone and that sucks for this fan.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Problems Playing Blu-ray on LG LHB335. It seems that every five minutes the movie would stop for a minute and start to fast forward! Also the LG LHB335 has the latest update and there is no more updates for this set for now! These blu-ray movies from Lucas Films are so different and not compatible with both my computer and and player! I thinking of returning the movies back for a refund!<br /><br />Updated; the LG LHB335 now plays Star Wars movies without trouble due to an update. Also I could play Star Wars on my computer but with an updated Cyberlink allow me to play it on my computer! Also the the way it was package lead to finger prints on the disks. I clean them and they played well!
B003OF3R0S|4.0|I was unable to find this album in the local music stores. I had heard several of the songs  on the internet and wanted the album. Amazon had it posted I bought it and I am very pleased  with my purchase. Delivered ahead of time and in excellent condition. Thanks
B004LWZW4C|2.0|Horrible story, bad acting, awkward directing, bad editing, cheesy dialogue, horrible special effects-this movie's got it all. It looks like a movie on a budget...and it acts like one. Prof and Magneto are the best actors here and do a lot of hand gesturing to exert their powers-what they call in the biz...acting. Everyone else is either horrible or forgettable. Bacon is...well...bacon.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Loved the movie! My son and I watched at least 10 times over the first weekend.  Fun for all ages. Something that everyone can relate to. Awesome entertaining even for the squirmiest little ones that usually don't sit still during a movie.
B0059R5Q08|3.0|I own several different versions of Jane Eyre.  This is not my favorite, not even close.  It tends to chop up the story.  Many of the wonderful dialogues are missing.  If you haven't read the book in a long time, it would be hard to follow.<br /><br />Currently my favorite version is the Masterpiece Theater production with Ruth Wilson.  It understands the passion and the values of Jane Eyre.  I also like Samantha Morton's Jane Eyre by A&E.  When I really want to enjoy Jane Eyre and I have the time, I love to watch the Timothy Dalton version.  Although 5-6 hours long, it is the most faithful to the novel.  If I want a shorter version, I might also watch Orson Welles as Mr. Rochester.  I am glad I added this to my collection of Jane Eyre movies, but I will probably not watch it again.<br /><br />I have to confess I am more of a Jane Austin fan, than a Charlotte Bronte fan.  Nonetheless, Jane Eyre is one of my favorite characters.  I admire the struggle she has between her passion and her morals.  Good stuff.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Installed in September. Started to play album from Amazon Cloud, but froze part way through first track. Had to force close the app, but then phone completely locked up.

B005O07RHA|5.0|This is the Breaking Bad that I have been hooked on for as long as this show has been around. In \\"Salud\\" we learn so much more about the motives of Gustavo and the person that both Jesse and Walt have become, is simply amazing to watch and a a joy every episodes. Some tense moments in this one as well as more adventures of Skyler and her past, which seems to be what every one in this show will soon face, a problem from the past. This episode is one of the reasons I have, and will continue, to watch Breaking Bad.
B005NZH1JA|5.0|I'm not being sappy or cynical when I say I laughed, cried, and was left with mouth hanging open during this episode of the best show on television. The contrast between Saul's wry humour, the touching and achingly realistic family moments, and the startling action sequences, made this an experience I won't soon forget. So many positive things have been said about this show, and for good reason. The acting is superlative in every way, the intricate plotting is a wonder to behold, the photography is gorgeous and the soundtrack and sound design are great. It has been one of the true entertainment privileges of the last few years, to witness the outward expression of Vince Gilligan's deeply nuanced and powerful creative mind. This is a major episode and I'm excited to see where it goes from here. Next Monday can't come soon enough.

B001F6TXME|5.0|A friend told me about the remote release from Nikon & I ordered one. My friend also said not to get the wireless  remote because the batterys will not hold up. I have used this wired remote & it is outstanding. The only thing & can find wrong is the wire is thiner than the last remote I had.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Even though I would have preferred to get the earlier movies without modifications, I thought it would be good to see the movies in HD.  I was going to buy them.  Now that I heard that Lucas even modified the new movies, I realized that I am not going to give any more of my money to that lunatic.
B004ZZS4CC|1.0|The story itself it sad, but the book is boring and poorly written.  There seemed to be no emotion.  It read like a bad police report.  The book seemed very impersonal.  Yes, I get that she went through a nightmare...  and again, the story of what happened is horrendous.  The book was awful.
0452295548|5.0|Very interesting and insightful look into the mind of a stroke as it's happening. I was really fascinated by her experience. This is a must read for anyone with an interest in the brain, for anyone who has had a stroke or knows someone who had a stroke.
0143038583|5.0|This book gives you the tools necessary to think about what you eat.  I have been struggling with this issue for some time because I found all the rhetoric rather confusing.  This book presents the information in a straightforward, easy to understand manner.  Much appreciated.  I will never look at food the same.

0307887898|4.0|So I went to a meetup here in LA last Thursday where Eric would be speaking and copies of his book would be available.  I've been following \\"Lean Startup\\" in fits and starts and decided that this would give me the complete overview.    Eric is a very good speaker and had a good rapport with the audience.  The way he answered the specific questions and the situations audience members asked of him demonstrated that he's refined the concepts so that they are 2nd nature to him.  It convinced my that I wouldn't waste my time if I read the book.    So I finished it cover-to-cover over the weekend.  I was not disappointed.    The principles are presented in mostly a qualitative, not quantitative style.  This was both good and bad in that he is signaling that you need to dig deeper if you want to acquire a thorough understanding.  For what I was looking for, his approach was appropriate.    My takeaway is that, this book is addressing those who have the passion to accomplish something that will have a great (and he and I both hope positive) effect on people. If you need to make money doing so, this will greatly help you figure out whether you are on the right track and how to adjust if you aren't.    However, disciplining yourself in the process is going to take a great deal of effort.  It is going to take a lot of learning and practice to start thinking this way.  I don't blame the book; I think this is just reality.    So, if you don't have innate passion in what you want to do, and all you want to do is make lots of money, then I agree with Eric that there are much easier ways to do so.    However, if you are frustrated because you have something you'd really like to do but you don't have enough confidence in knowing you have an effective approach to get there, then this is the best book I've seen for getting started.    I knocked this down one star because I to some degree agree that some of the verbiage is self-promotion that I could have done without.  But, this is small change compared to the helpful orientation that this book can provide you.    btw, reading this book re-awoke an old dream that I had given up on.  I just may \\"go for it yet\\".
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Decent graphics and intuitive controls makes this a fun game to play.  Replay value is not too high but if you appreciate B movies (Army of the Dead) and cheesey one liners this game is for you.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Very pleased with this purchase. Came wrapped in heart patterned tissue paper; a extra plus, as this was a gift to a wonderful woman.    Well made, arrived on time, very happy with my purchase.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Unlike other tower defense games. This one brings together decent graphics and a storyline that's fun and adds to the replay value. Multiple levels with different weapon types makes you go back for more.
0761119752|5.0|This is a really fun book that you can sing to.  My son loves it.  My husband and I have it memorized we've read it so many times.
0812550706|5.0|I hope to share this with my teenage son who loves to read. This was a great book. I love science fiction and Orson Scott Card is a favorite, but out of all his books, this one is my sentimental favorite. No romance (which is also a fave for me), just intelligent, well written sci fi.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|SERENITY is a awesome movie! The special effects are really fantastic! The story line revolves around River Tam (Summer Glau) whose brain holds a secret the Alliance doesn't want known. They send out an assassin to find River so they can control her. Captain Malcolm Reynolds, so aptly and brilliantly played by Nathan Fillion, protects her and her brother, Simon. He tries to stay one jump ahead of the assassin and this makes for edge-of-the-seat action. The one disappointing aspect, (to me, anyway), is that the relationship between Mal Reynolds and his lady love, Inara Serra, (Morena Baccarin), is not expanded or explored more fully. She sticks with him through thick and thin, and in the end, he doesn't seem to appreciate her devotion to him or show that he's really glad she's staying aboard Serenity.
B003X5UDEW|5.0|Ip Man is the most heartbreakingly beautiful movie I have seen. If only all the world would follow the ideals of Ip.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|In CASTLE, Nathan Fillion displays his great versatility as an actor. His character, mystery writer, Richard Castle, has a puckish sense of humor, a knack for putting his foot in his mouth and is a caring and loving father to his daughter, Alexis. He has a very unique way of solving crimes, sometimes annoying and exasperating NYPD Detective, Kate Beckett, who he's supposed to be observing/assisting. They struggle to work together, but Kate soon finds out that Castle has a brilliant mind when it comes to crime solving and, in spite of his procedural ineptness, he really does help her more than he hinders her. The supporting cast nicely balances out the he/she interaction and sexual tension between Castle and Beckett. The plots are well thought out and written. I can see why this show continues to be one of the best on TV.
B0042ESTQW|5.0|It's small profile, stays in place, gives access to what you want, pressing the buttons are still easy, and it's protected the unit when I dropped it once or twice. I specifically like that it curls up a bit on the top side, so if the unit is set down on the screen side the actual screen sits above the ground a little bit.
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|There have been many thoughtful reviews here, some giving great praise, some excoriating, so I'll restrict myself to stating what I have not seen here yet, and that's my continuing dismay that not a single version yet of Jane Eyre (that I've seen) has fulfilled Charlotte Bronte's vision:  to prove to the world that audiences will fall in love with an ugly hero and a woman, as she put it, \\"as plain as I am.\\"  I've seen paintings of Charlotte Bronte. She didn't look like Mia Wasikowska.<br /><br />What makes this version the most egregious in this area is that BOTH actors are beautiful. In most versions, they have a gorgeous Rochester (which I'm sure would make Charlotte laugh pretty hard, unless it made her cry with frustration)  and a Jane played by an actress who is plain by Hollywood standards (and would probably be the prettiest girl in the room anywhere else), or a lovely Jane and a homely Rochester (George C. Scott, Orson Welles).  In this one we have not one, but TWO hot to trot Hollywood gorgeous actors playing a man repeatedly described in the book, including by Jane herself, as ugly, and a woman who is called a little toad and someone formed for labor, not for love.<br /><br />What is so odd about this is that British productions DO cast plainish actresses and actors, all the time.  They cast a plain actress to play the beautiful Esther in Bleak House.  They cast Burn Gorman to play a hot, sexy doctor on Torchwood.  Why is it that casting directors are so skittish about Jane Eyre?  Why the Mia Wasikowskas and Toby Stephens and Timothy Daltons?<br /><br />The closest to getting it right is the one with Samantha Morton, a good looking woman who can be made to look homely with the right lighting, and Ciaran Hinds who again is somewhat good looking but not handsome in the usual sense. In this version, the derogatory comments about Jane, and Rochester's severe insecurity, make sense.<br /><br />In five years, when they make another Jane Eyre, here's hoping theyhave the guts to do what Charlotte Bronte did, make the point that audiences can fall in love with the coupling of a homely  woman and an ugly man.

B0037A4ILC|5.0|Finally a movie about mountains that treats the subject of mountains without loosing the main subject; the mountain climb.  Don't freak out when you find out that this is a german movie with english sub titles.  It is not your typical hollywood movie and that is great (not that there is any thing wrong with hollywood movies).  Just enough romance to keep it real. They don't try to please the boys and the girls they present the emotional side of the story with credibility.  80% of this movie is about climbing Eiger north face and it is done with very credible scenes, costumes and historical facts.  Great scenes, intense suspense and just a great movie that breaks with the main stream stuff.    Enjoy it!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Sry haters!!! I LLOVED THIS take on the Movie, this movie is way way better than 2 stars people,if i listened to u guys i would have never of saw this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i dont know why you guys hate Lucas so much., he made these to keep up to times, i like the looks of the cgi made Yoda, i like it. Im totally stunned at the stupidity here!!! They will make the old original version. some wont like it!!! Of course i will!! a couple scenes i was weary about but didnt make the movie bad in no way!!! WOW, amazed!!!! Star Wars In Blu Ray..... 5 STARS!!!!!

B003ZSJ212|2.0|Well, being a Star Wars nut, I went against my better judgement and bought this Blu-Ray set at the \\"bargain\\" price, and it's a good thing the price was slashed or I would have demanded a refund.  The only good thing so far about this Blu-Ray set is the free T-shirt deal :)    How could George and his staff manage to screw up again???  And yet they have.  These \\"Hi-Def\\" versions obviously couldn't be from the films themselves.  I believe they just enhanced the standard DVDs.  The color is lousy is you don't have a top of the line HDTV.  Bottom line: stick with the standard DVDs and wait for a better Blu-Ray set to be issued.  You know they will come out in time.  George won't pass up yet another chance to milk the public for more profits.  Take a tip George...Try not...Do...Or do not....There is no try :)    A couple of side-notes:  The packaging is terrible...you need the strength of The Force to get the disks out of their slots...LOL  And the Star Wars spoofs....What spoofs???  How can you have a series of spoofs without Hardware Wars & Spaceballs??? (Well, just a brief scene from that film but hardly enough, and hardly the funniest scenes).  Maybe we do need The Schwartz instead of The Force... :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so addicting i had to get all three!! I love this series!! Katniss doesn't know what she's really worth and Peeta is worth loving!! I recommend this book to anyone who reads the reviews! I can't believe I waited this long to buy it!!

0375826742|5.0|This book was a great third installment in the Inheritance Cycle. It was thrilling and also had a few twists that kept you guessing. Very well written book.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Firstly....the cover designs are lame.  He couldnt leave the classic poster designs of the period alone.    As far as the films are concerned, I wish Lucas would just get on with it and digitize the entire saga with digital characters, voices etc.    I have a sneaking suspicion that after the entire world buys yet another format of this film, he will license Criterion to release the ORIGINAL trilogy as it was released back in the 1977-1983.  BTW, is it me or is Lucas starting to look like Jabba the Hutt?  Where does his multichins end?
B005G26NJE|5.0|I was lucky enough to catch Gary Clark Jr. at a small venue in Austin after he played Austin City Limits. I wasn't familiar with him, but a friend recommended we go. I was completely blown away and in awe. It's the first time I've ever had the sensation I was in the same room with an undiscovered genius. Ok...he's not completely undiscovered, but if some random dude like me can pay 20 bucks and find himself standing 5 feet from the stage, I'd say he's virtually undiscovered. I was amazed within the first 30 seconds and the impression never waned, from one blistering guitar solo, to the next slow-tempo ballad. I'm not going to pretend to know a lot about music, but I listen to a lot and I think this guy is a phenom.     I see others here have mentioned Stevie Ray Vaughn and Jimi Hendrix. Those were the two names that passed trough my mind as I watched. My girlfriend turned to me and mentioned the same two artists, so there's something to it.    I understand he's got a full album coming out next year. I'll be eagerly awaiting, and hoping to catch him live again sometime. As great ash this recorded stuff is, there's nothing like the power of the live performance I just attended. I doubt I'll have the opportunity to see him at such a small venue next time. This guy is going places.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Everything. About the bluray conversions were perfect.   All the changes made the movies better. I loved the adition of vader sayint no in episode 6 it made things even better.
B00004RJ71|5.0|This is a good movie about the life in a gang. I use to be a gangster back in my day....lol. I'm not that old, Im only 28 yrs old. But It takes me back. It is about three man. One who ends up in and out of jail. One losing his family over drugs. The other cleaning up his life and sending his cousin back into jail. If you don't mind kicking back with a gangster movie this is the one you must see.
B005974CNA|5.0|Beautiful. There is more creativity and life in this album then there has been in years of DT album. You can NOT go wrong with this offering. DT is a BAND, not a person, so they are carrying on as a band, and for this I am grateful.
B004V6MWFU|1.0|This album is like listening to an autistic kid play the ukelele:    -You squirm with discomfort while suffering through an abysmal performance.  -You want to laugh, but you know it's not right.  -When it's over you're unimpressed, but feel the need to say \\"you're special\\" and \\"A for effort\\" before handing him back his helmet.    Senseless, passionless dribble.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is really fun and let's you unlock tons of new plants to battle those pesky zombies! I definitely recommend this game.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|First of all, I'm of the belief that all things should be considered only within the scope of their intended purpose. Thor is a kids movie and I will treat as such.    The story is predictable, but high on fantasy, cool creatures and characters, and exciting action. It was great for me (although I am not a child), since I was exactly in the mood for a well produced relaxing hour and a half.

I think Blu-Ray is OK,but I don't think it is necessary to replace all of your DVD's in your collection(if you have a huge DVD collection).The quality is just not that much better for the average person to warrant all of the extra expense.I do buy Blu-Ray movies,but only if I didn't already own the movie on DVD.

B0053Q9DHW|4.0|Shipped on time. Was in good condition.   I ordered this movie for myself because it's great.  The performances are strong and I knew I needed to own it the second I saw it in the theater.  It's not as good as the Ruth Wilson/Toby Stephens version, but it's still very good.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|While traveling in our RV, my sister-in-law phoned us: the plastic cap on her Nissan food jar had broken, and she uses that jar almost daily. Using this app on our LG Ally, I quickly found the item on Amazon, ordered it, and sent it on its way to her house a thousand miles away. She had it 2 days later. We bought the original jar for her from Amazon, so it was easy to find again. Trying to do this on a laptop would have required a wifi link, but none was available. Great service from Amazon and an easy-to-use Android app from Amazon.

1250004349|5.0|I loved this book. I read other people's reviews and I take them into consideration before reading a book as I am very picky with fiction. This book had me from the beginning. And yes, after \\"the past\\" part of the story drops off and all that is left is the \\"today part\\" it does lose a little magic but I thought both stories intertwined well.<br />I know the ending is a little far fetched but it's fiction!! I give the book 5 stars - I really liked it start to finish and I recommend it. There is nothing off the top of my head I can think of that I didn't like about this book.
1401310400|1.0|First, i'd like to say that i am a HUGE \\"Castle\\" fan. I've never missed a show and look forward to it every week. Normally i wont record it and prefer to watch it \\"live\\".    I was excited to read the book and bought it on my kindle.     Barely pages in i began to realize that this was going to be bad. First of all, i truly believe that this book is not written by a man.(not being sexist...more of a writing style). It has detail that doesnt make sense and i have to say, its horribly written. Its like reading about people brushing their hair and all the minutia that goes into it. Its almost laughable. Im sorry to sound so mean, but i was very disappointed.  I mean, i guess if you are into romance type novels then this might be for you.    I have literally read thousands of books and i can count on one hand how many i couldnt complete. This is one of them. I would highly not recommend.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Some people that did not like the movie fail to realize the overall point of the movie. While many depictions of Christ show different aspects of his life, some concentrating on the early years and some focusing on the preaching or the miracles, this movie takes a very specific part and plays it out. The actual beating and torture are filmed in real time. So for people feeling like the amount of lashes were overdone or that there were no other aspects of Jesus's life are not living the actual journey of feeling what Jesus endured. To pace the movie like you were witnessing the torture is a unique approach to a movie. If this were the first or only movie ever produce on the life of Christ, fine. But it is not. I think what Mel Gibson was trying to achieve was to give the viewer a journey into living the moments up to the crucifiction If you were a bystander back on that particular day, than this is probably what you would have witnessed and felt. To tell the story any other way would not have achieved this goal. If you are looking for other dimensions to Christ's life, then buy Jesus of Nazerath or some other production. I for one felt compelled to watch every moment of the torture to appreciate what a human being, the son of God or not, endured for his beliefs. Like Shindlers list or video from 9/11, watching this is like paying tribute to those who suffered and died. It is not the kind of movie you would want to watch over and over. Or maybe more than once. And whether you or religious or atheist, you are just watching an account of an event that happened in history. Based on the movies objective, I give it 5 stars for cinematography, wardrobe, special effects etc. I really is a powerful production.
B0013V33DG|5.0|Great performance. Dessay and Florez are absolutely wonderful. The rest of the cast is worthy of great merit as well.

0515142247|3.0|\\"Die Trying\\" by Lee Child was my second Jack Reacher novel since I chose to read the series in order as Child's website recommends. Much like \\"Killing Floor\\", this book is jam-packed with action from the get-go.I found it interesting that Child decided on a 3rd person narrative for this novel since the first was written in the 1st person. I really enjoyed both but in my opinion Child shines more writing in this capacity.    The plot in this book is as unlikely as the first but I found it very entertaining. Reacher, to me does not seem as brutal in this book and the fight scenes are a bit more tame which I was a bit disappointed in. There is a part in this book however when Child describes Reacher crawling through a cave that is absolutely terrifying and beautifully written. Child does seem to waste many pages in painfully long descriptives of firearms and physics which were not necessary and a bit annoying at times. He also had me lost in the forest quite a bit and I never really had a grasp of the geography he was trying so hard to paint a picture of.    This book was entertaining but I liked it considerably less than \\"Killing Floor\\" although I preferred his writing method in this one. I look forward to reading more of this series.
B0011ZW6N2|3.0|Ok, so I analyzed this album and I compare it with \\"The World Needs A Hero\\". In my opinion, they both have several good songs, but all the other songs are very uninspiring and boring. I tried to get into \\"Risk\\", but bad reviews proved to be true, complete waste of time... Anyway, we live in a time of incredibly accesible digital music and we are lucky that this website offer good quality mp3's. I'd recommend \\"Sleepwalker\\", \\"You're Dead\\" and \\"Burnt Ice\\".
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|I waited to hold this album in my hands for sooooooo long, but the wait was worth it. Demi managed to change her style to R&B in some tracks and keep her powerful pop ballads. The collaborations are simply amazing, and the rest of the songs tell powerful stories while showing Demi's amazing vocals. This album put her in a \\"Kelly Clarkson, Christina Aguilera\\" type of artist. This girl is going places and you won't want to miss any step of her way to the top. Buy the album.

0547391005|5.0|I've always been a fan of Curious George - and after seeing the exhibition at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco last spring, I was motivated to get some books for my nephew.  The \\"Complete Adventures\\" was sold out at the gift shop and I had to wait for it on Amazon, too - but when I got it, I was excited to note that there was also a CD.  I'm going to have to wait a few years for my nephew's feedback since he's only 18 months old.  :)

0307454541|2.0|It took me nearly 400 page to start to care about what was going on in this book - since I was a languages major, I always read through and confess to having read the last 40 pages or so when I was around page 250.<br /><br />First, I have to say that this book could stand some real editing down. I agree with folks that it's hard to understand what the monetary values are - it would have been nice to have a little appendix with some of the figures - at the date this is set Kronor = X pounds = X dollars or whatever.<br /><br />I didn't find the names of the characters all that confusing as some of the other reviewers did - names are just names, people! But why didn't they translate \\"Ms\\" - unless \\"Froken\\" has some hidden meaning - perhaps they should have explained the cultural context and the reason for not translating that in an appendix.<br /><br />Yes - it was irritating to continually read gratuitous references of Mac hardware and applications (a URL in the book to a freeware app, REALLY???).<br /><br />Here's another question - why did they change the original name? \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" is much more appropriate.<br /><br />The parallel character development - Martin and Lisbeth - was just not that well done. I have to admit when the book described how handsome he is - I was a bit amazed at the frumpy plain looking middle aged guy they picked to play Martin in the movie!<br /><br />Despite the gore and violence depicted in the book - in the end, it felt like a lukewarm and overly long setup to create a super smart female hacker protagonist who embezzles money from a criminal to live happily ever after spending freely and traveling wherever she wants.<br /><br />*yawn*<br /><br />Another Cinderella story. Next, please!
1594481717|5.0|I went to college wanting to become a doctor.  But though biology and medicine fascinated me, I couldn't find the passion for it that I wanted to have. That passion was waiting for me in my English classes, which annoyed me. I didn't want an English degree because I didn't want to write or teach professionally. I spent several semesters trying to avoid it, the study of English and literature eventually drew me in. I ended up with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English.    The four years since graduation have been a slow reconciliation between me and the degree I earned. I recently came across Daniel Pink's book A Whole New Mind and it inspired in me new optimism and pride for my English degree.    A Whole New Mind argues that with the developed world's new widespread abundance and automation, along with the rise of Asian world powers, we're entering a new post-Information Age. The book refers to this new era as The Conceptual Age. This new age will place (or is already placing) new emphasis on six human attributes in the workplace that can't be readily emulated by a computer or outsourced to cheaper labor on the other side of the world.    These attributes are design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning.  All six are associated with the right hemisphere of the human brain, the region associated with creativity and feeling--as opposed to the left hemisphere's tendency towards logic and linear structure.    Pink gives each of the six traits its own section in the book.  As an English major, I was most excited by the story section. Pink points out that throughout human civilization, facts and information have been valuable commodities, but in the Information Age, facts and information were digitized and are therefore cheap and readily accessible.  As a result, our minds now require context to understand and utilize these data.  This context can also be called story.    As in the other five sections, Pink has a few anecdotes that support his insistence on story'snew importance in the professional world.  My favorite bit of evidence is 3M executives taking story-telling classes to become better leaders and more efficient communicators.  Pink also points out a new movement in medicine that encourages doctors to get to know their patients' individual stories as a means of strengthening communication and making treatment more effective.    I enjoyed the entire book, but I was especially interested in the story section because I believe I have a propensity and talent for story that I could only wish to have with science and medicine.    The six traits highlighted by Pink are not entirely separate--they form a creative and non-linear whole that is markedly different from the left-brain thinking that was of primary importance for our society up to and through the Information Age.  But as Daniel Pink demonstrates, we're advancing in a new direction that requires new ways of thinking.  I'm not yet sure how I'll be able to participate in this new age, but after reading A Whole New Mind, I'm thrilled to find out.
0316044938|3.0|I enjoyed the story and found this to be a fast read. I felt that it had a lot of areas that weren't properly developed or explored. I liked the idea of the dead being able to watch from above and live vicariously - but being able to see everything that everyone is doing all the time is kind of creepy.<br /><br />The whole possession of Ruth wasn't really explained well enough for my taste - just \\"fell to earth\\"? Also odd was the mother just disappearing for 8+ years and returning. I thought that the sister, Lindsey, was one of the better characters while the brother, Buck, was not as well developed as he could have been.<br /><br />I haven't yet seen the movie - but already could see from the trailers they did take a lot of liberty with the story (ie, the brother saying that Susie was in the \\"in-between\\") among other things. I've got the movie on Netflix and will just watch it as being \\"inspired by\\" - rather than a strict interpretation of the somewhat under developed novel.
1577314808|5.0|I've only read about ten minutes of this but It has struck me already as a book that I will probably end up reading multiple times. I don't have anything spiritully profound to say about this book yet except that every person should read it. I'm really excited to keep reading and wish I didn't have to work tonight. Tolle you scoundrel lol

B005NZH1JA|5.0|This was an excellent episode to build a great future in the Breaking Bad series.  I really appreciate the development of other characters over the years (of course I just caught up on this shows last 4-5 years of episodes in 4 months).     This episode really solidifies Giancarlo Esposito's characters agenda as he goes about taking down his rivals through making the ultimate potential sacrificing himself to gain one step forward, to take his chess piece forward and strike down the king.    I love this show.

B005COO1X6|4.0|I read King's Mile 81 last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. Readers are split on this one, I don't ever think I've seen reviews more evenly divided between the stars than this short story. Leave it to King to even know how to manipulate what should be a bell curve!    Mile 81 leads us into familiar King territory, the secret world of kids. One reviewer went on and on about how kids would do this and wouldn't do that. Well, that reviewer is clueless. He or she may know how kids act when adults are around, but none of us knows what happens when they are with each other. It's true . . . And, frankly, I don't care because King creates a child's world that I believe. My ex used to play a variant on Paratroopers from Hell as a boy and has the scars to prove it. And listen to boys when they don't know they are being overheard, it is eff-this and eff-that as they flex their fledgling man-muscles. And as the proud possessor of my very first hangover at age 12, the thought that a boy would say, \\"yuk\\" at the bottle of vodka is wishful thinking at best.    And that is the crux of this tale. The monster was defeated because three children saw it for what it was and believed it to be what it was. Adults just kept lining up, as symbolized by the traffic jam on the off-ramp (one Expedition, pick-up with a trailer, abandoned gre-en Prius and a man-eating Ford or Chevy . . . sung to the tune of 12 Days of Christmas). And because adults had to believe there was a rational explanation (after all, they are adults) they kept being eaten. It didn't have to be a car. It could have been a thinny, a Venus Fly-Trap or a portable black hole. The car was a prop. Nothing more. Adults were eaten because they had lost their belief in monsters.    Enter the two young children who watch their parents disappear into the maw of the car. They knew the truth and the truth was monstrous. Five dead adults later, a 10-year old listens to the story told by the youngsters and sees the logic. Only a monster could do such a thing. Ergo, the car is a monster. However, in true \\"boy\\" fashion, he couldn't leave it alone. Calling back to The Body and IT, the boy just has to see the dead kid, just has to play in the Barrens, and just has to run up and touch the door of the haunted house. The magnifying glass is a trope. Nothing more. He wanted to have a story to tell the Raiders. He had wanted to show off his prowess with a magnifying glass and been dismissed. What better story than to focus it on a monster? And it worked. My only complaint was that it worked a little too well. I would have rather had a puddle of stinky goo for the adults to muse over while the kids knew the truth.    I never understand the constant rage in reviews about character development in plot-driven stories like this. What did you need to know about Bible guy or horse lady other than they were really tasty. It was their cars in the conga line on the off-ramp that moved the story along, not their personalities. The theme of this story (and oh how I loathe themes) was the fundamental difference between adults and children and how sometimes that difference is deadly. Well done to my fav writer and I loved the sneak peek at the JFK thriller.  PS: Why comment about a Stephen King comment about Sarah Palin that is irrelevant to this story. Other than, there is a monster not even King could dream up.
0765350386|5.0|Well, I always read bad ratings first.  I wouldn't call this book bad. I'm not big fantasy fan and this is my second fantasy book I've read. The first one was Lord Of The Rings...However, I like the idea of the book, and may be the girl is 17-years old kick ass, as some one mentioned, but this book is still very good. You just need to read a bit deeper. You are just too flat and looking for character emotions, while I found something different in this book, besides the fairy-tale...

B005EZJ3MW|5.0|When I first heard Demi's third album \\"Unbroken,\\" it was a different side of Demi that I have never heard before.<br /><br />There are songs with an R&B edge to them such as \\"All Night Long,\\" \\"Who's That Boy,\\" \\"In Real Life\\" and \\"My Love is Like a Star.\\" There are also songs with a pop-dance edge to them such as \\"You're My Only Shorty,\\" \\"Unbroken,\\" and \\"Hold Up.\\"<br /><br />The song \\"For the Love of a Daughter\\" has to be one of Demi's most well-written songs of all time along with \\"Skyscraper.\\"
B003ZSJ212|4.0|It's Star Wars, what more do you need to say? Episodes I-III are still painful to watch, because Jake Lloyd, Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman did not act well and Lucus wrote awful dialog. That said, the special effects are amazing and something to behold. Episodes IV-VI are far superior, but you probably already know this.    Since so much will be written, let me just offer this point. I watched Episodes I-III with the commentary from Lucas, McCallum and others on (just to avoid the dialog).  Poor George Lucus, while an obviously talented filmmaker, is still \\"stuck in the 60's.\\" Unfortunately, he was not well served by his history teachers, making comments about Richard Nixon trying to change the constitution to serve a third term (false) to Roman and French history (wrong again on the fall of the Roman Republic and the French Revolution) and, of course, referring to the Vietnam War as a war of \\"primitives\\" against a \\"technologically advanced\\" society like the U.S. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Vietnam conflict, colored by old, worn out propaganda from Hanoi.  (Whatever your opinion of the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese were anything but \\"primitive\\" or technologically inferior, as was documented by Dr. Michael Lind - a well known Liberal - in his book \\"Vietnam: A Necessary War.\\" North Vietnam, and by extension their proxies the Viet Cong, received state of the art military hardware from both the USSR and Communist China.)    Yes, Lucas is a big Liberal, no surprise. That comes through in his commentaries but if you can ignore it, it is still worthwhile to hear the other comments on the history of the movies and what he intended.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|It does need an undo button and the one hint every 24 hours is enough to make me want to uninstall. Why pay for a game and get limited hints? Especially when it can be challenging enough to make you want to throw your phone at the next spider you see?? Five stars when the hint is more reasonable. Absolutely no issues with the game though . It's very polished Samsung droid charge.
B005974CNA|4.0|This album definitely lives up to its hype. With all of the drama out of the way with Portnoy leaving, it seems they have finally settled and found their new sound. Enough with the comparing it to older albums too... no need to dwell on the past when the present is as strong as this. Yes, it may have elements from the 90's albums... but it also has elements from the past few.<br /><br />Mangini's drumming is solid and fills the void Portnoy left quite well. Petrucci's solos are better than ever. Myung is back after his lackluster performances on the past few albums. Rudess has a few beautifully crafted classical piano sections on the album and his keyboard work is genius as usual. LaBrie's vocals, although not perfect, are solid.<br /><br />4.5/5 That half point is taken off solely due to one thing... the Linkin Park-esque intro for Build Me Up, Break Me Down. But, the rest of the song makes up for it =D. This is a MUST BUY for a TRUE Dream Theater fan.
B00192IV9U|5.0|Now, I did not purchase this CD through this website, however when I first heard about it, I was a bit skeptical due to the fans thoughts, etc. regarding the authenticity as to whether or not it's Michael's voice on the album, & so I went ahead & bought the album myself, although I bought it at Best Buy instead.<br />So after purchasing & listening to the album for myself very carefully, I do truly believe that it IS Michael's voice on the album.<br />And that's not gonna change my views on it.<br />I don't care what people say, although people can have whatever opinions on it, & that's perfectly fine.<br />My personal fave songs off the new album are as follows:<br /><br />Hold My Hand<br />Keep Your Head Up<br />Monster<br />Breaking News<br />Behind the Mask<br />Much Too Soon<br /><br />So again, I think it's a great CD & is something that i will continue to listen to, along w/ his other great songs from his past work for years to come.<br /><br />And one final thing: Michael Jackson is truly, without a doubt the one & the ONLY KING OF POP!!! :) '
B0054PET3K|4.0|Kasabian return with album number 4 the weirdly titled \\"Velociraptor\\", so it should come as no surprise that this is one of Kasabian's most ambitious albums to date, not bad for a band that has seen lazy journalism call Kasabian, Oasis clones and labelled them lad rock. While Kasabian might share some of Oasis confidence and swagger their music has always been more closely linked to Primal Scream, Happy Mondays, The Stone Roses and even 70's glam rock. A quick look back at their 3 previous albums would show a band not scared to experiment with different styles and sounds.   The album opens with \\"Let's Roll Like We Used To\\" which sees songwriter Serge Pizzorno looking back at the early days before they made it big. It's a good start to the album. On \\"Days Are Forgotten\\" the track starts off with some big beats and a funky groove and features some lyrics that have a nice dig at their critics. There's the brilliance of the Beatles-esque sounding \\"La Fée Verte\\" which is sung by Pizzorno. Add that to Kraftwerk sounding \\"I Hear Voices\\" and it shows that Kasabian are willing to experiment in as many styles of music as possible.   The title track \\"Velociraptor!\\" is a big sounding stomp that has Tom spitting out his lyric's, not to many bands could pull off a song about a dinosaur with out sounding stupid. There's the epic \\"Acid Turkish Bath (Shelter from the Storm)\\" which at over 6 minutes long sounds like Kashmir era Led Zeppelin. The album features two big tracks that are made for playing live the brilliant \\"Re-Wired\\" with its big chorus and the beat driven \\"Switchblade Smiles\\" a song that won't full be appreciated until it's played live.   With the deluxe edition you get the full near 2 hour show from the O2 in Dublin, Ireland from November 2009, it's mixed in full surround as well. The Deluxe Edition comes in a white box set and contains the lyrics of all the tracks as well as poster of the black artwork of the album. One drawback of the white is that it marks really easy so it's best to handle with care!  With every album kasabian seem to make another stride musically, and \\"Velociraptor!\\" is no exception. For a band that talk big and don't lack confidence it's important they back it up strong musically and with \\"Velociraptor!\\" they certainly do. This could be the album that takes Kasabian from the arenas to Stadium Headliners!
0345529057|5.0|I highly recommend this. If you've never read fantasy before, buy this. It is everything you want in a series; love, war, death, life, everything. The 4 book set is a good deal also. If you read the first one you'll want the rest of them, immediately, so just buy the box set. A Song of Ice and Fire is going to be one of the best epic fantasy series ever. Enjoy!
1932100660|3.0|I stumbled onto this book while doing my favorite thing--wandering through bookstores sipping coffee!  This is a much needed addition to the canon of nutrition books that are out there.  It is truly a must read by anyone seriously interested in health and nutrition.  However, sadly, I cannot give it five stars.  While not a nutrition scientist, before my current role as an advisor on scientific issues I was a physician in naturopathic practice.  The reality of what I saw in the clinic after seeing thousands of patients over many years does not compare with much of what this book has to say.  Namely, that the simple reductionist idea--to used the authors phraseology on the issue when writing about vitamins and medications--that animal protein is the sole culprit just doesn't hold--at least not clinically.  In fact, one of the things that stopped me year ago from my push towards full vegetarianism was the overwhelming observational evidence that my vegetarian patients were often my sickest patients.  Surprisingly, obesity was a key problem.  I also found these patients to be the most ideological and reluctant to alter their diets in any way--some also couldn't because of religious doctrine.  Often, we struggled year after year to get the weight off and to keep them healthy.  Surprise?  I sure was!<br /><br />Another reason why I can't go more than three stars is that the author mentions other books like South Beach, Zone, Atkins, etc... and makes the same generalized biased statements that only folks who have never really read the books make, such as only advocating them as quick two-week weight loss programs.  Atkins initially made some huge diet blunders the 1970s, but all of them now pretty much talk about the importance of healthy lifestyle changes--for life.  Moreover, even Atkins now talks about the important difference of good fat and protein, from say fish, versus fat and protein from beacon.  I felt that the jab at the other diets was much more ideological than that of the \\"objective scientist\\" we are told in the book.<br /><br />From a clinical perspective, I have seen almost all of the diets work!  In fact, if I could think of the ones that didn't, I would be sure to name it here!  As a physician, I have personally seen the reversal of things like heart disease and diabetes with Atkins, Ornish, and South Beach (Agatston)--the three most used in my clinical practice, with a bit of The Zone and Blood Type throw in.  The real question was maintaining these diets in today's fast food world.  The slippery slope of brownies at the office party, cocktails with colleagues, and complexity of some diets make them too tough to maintain.  Also, we are often times too much of a quick fix where is the pill society in a time where lifestyle changes are desperately needed.<br /><br />Ultimately, I respect Dr Campbell for writing this book and adding to the much needed debate on health and nutrition in this country.  However, it is a book I would place right alongside all the other diet books on my shelf.<br /><br />For the record, my favorite and the one that has possibly had the greatest impact on my own personal health is:  Power Up Your Brain, by Perlmutter and Villoldo.  I also give a tremendous hats off to Dr. Atkins.  He has been much vilified and stepped on, yet much of what is out there began with him.  His science of nutrition wasn't perfect, but it was a huge stepping stone.an that of the \\"objective scientist\\" we are told in the book.<br /><br />From a clinical perspective, I have seen almost all of the diets work!

0316098329|5.0|To five year old Jack, the entire world is Room.  Since the moment of his birth in Room, he has never, even for a second, been outside.  He knows nothing but what is found in Room, which includes his young mother , who is also kept locked up in Room.  Jack sees television shows, reads books, and learns a variety of things from his mother.  But to Jack \\"real\\" is only what exists in Room; everything else is pretend or imaginary.    Jack and his mother are not victims of some rare auto-immune disease that keeps them locked away from the germ infested world \\"outside\\".  They are victims of a man Jack refers to as \\"Old Nick\\" who comes each night to visit his mother.  Although Old Nick knows of Jack's existence, Jack's mother feels it is best to have her son be out of sight in a closet when Old Nick comes to call.  Their very existence depends on Old Nick, to give them food, heat, water, electricity, clothing, and any other basic necessity they might need.  Old Nick doles these necessities out grudgingly, expecting warm gratitude from his captives.    It is obvious from the very beginning of Room that Jack's mother is coming to the end of her rope.  She has been a captive in Room for seven  years and although she tries desperately to make Jack's life \\"normal\\", she knows it is only a matter of time before Jack will begin to insist on explanations to questions she dare not answer     Room raises the question:  how do we know what we know?  If our lives are narrowed to a space of  11 square  feet ,and we are never allowed beyond those small confines, how much can we really comprehend, outside of our actual experiences?  Though Jack's mother understands the horror of their confinement, at five years old, having known nothing else, their prison seems \\"normal \\" to Jack.    Even in this seemingly bleak situation, there lurks the slimmest chance for escape.  But it will all depend on little Jack whose courage and resourcefulness will be tested to the limit in a dangerous game ofhide and seek.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have watched 3 of the films since buying this set a few days ago.  For me, I have enjoyed every minute of my time watching them.  The picture quality is very, very good, and the sound is absolutely fantastic (I have a 106\\" screen with 1080p projector, plus a surround sound system that cost $5,000+).  I'm neither a Star Wars freak nor a Home Cinema geek, but I do enjoy a good movie.  In watching 3 of the 6 so far, I have enjoyed every minute.    If you can see beyond the dismal reviews that appear elsewhere (mostly from people that, as of this date, haven't even seen the movies - why do Amazon allow that?), and if you are not besotted with 1970's VHS technology, then I think you will most likely get the same pleasure from these movies that I have.
B002XTXFU8|3.0|I'm not sure what the goal or vision of the filmaker was. The movie was interesting. Tom Hardy is a great actor. He will go far.  Interesting is the thought I had after watching the movie. There are some people that are simply outside civilization. They just  thug their way through life. They don't get it and they never will. When faced with freedom the Bronson character didn't have a clue   or skills at a normal life. Just his fists. Bottom line, certainly worth checking out.
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|There is nothing really bad about this film, it actually was a very good story. I just think most thought it would be much scarier like the fairy tale many grew up with, but the story told and shown here was not a heart thumper but more of a thriller type mystery. I happen to like peoples different takes on tales and myths, because that's what they are and you can make of them what you will. It is always nice to get another version or people get bored with the old ones. We all have our versions of what we think a werewolf, witch, god, vampire, or monster should be and act, but if it does not come to old standards it is shunned, however old standards are just that..old, something new and entertaining is not always bad and should be at least given its props for effort. This movie held my attention and i enjoyed the ending very well! Not a bad watch!
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's attention to detail that makes this stand out.  Not only is the puzzle gameplay solid, but beautiful environments &amp; music show that a lot of love was put into this.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|The instrumentals (Danger Mouse) subtly captivate the listener, while the vocals (Cee Lo) not-so-subtly captivate.  Cee Lo and Danger Mouse complement each other very well in St. Elsewhere, an album that is both melancholic and beautiful.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I have and Apple TV and the first thing that I noticed is that since Apple Tv and other devices doesn't have Analog audio output (rca white and red connectors) and some Multizone Audio Video receivers (mine is a Yamaha) need this input to send audio to a second Zone (mi case) i did a lot of research and happens to find this device arrive fast as usually when you order via Amazon and it looks very well constructed for a device this size, very small and easy to work/hide. I just connected to my Apple Tv and receiver and Voila, now I can heard my Ipad/Ipod music in my outdoor speakers, and for the price is excellent.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|I don't have TV, VHS nor Blu-ray player. I first watched Star Wars when I was 9 years old in 1978, Brooklyn, New York. At first, I didn't like it, I thought it was a movie about toys but when i start seeing other movies, I appreciated at it more. Not that Star Wars was good but other movies were so bad. This movie was a portal to discover better films like Seven Samurai, Hidden Fortress and others. I think Star Wars was once an attractive woman who is aging and needing plastic surgeries to stay young and relevant. Her true beauty is inner than outer appearance now.

I took the online assessment after I read the book and it was pretty much spot on with my personality. The assessment gave me suggestions on how to better utilize the strengths I already have in order to live a more powerful and productive life. I would highly recommend this book to everyone!

0061714402|4.0|I have been a Metallica fan for many many years. Their music literally changed me. I have always considered Dave Mustaine a whiny brat who constantly berated James and Lars for firing him from Metallica so many years ago. I always just thought he should move on and stop being such a baby. Now, that said, I am also a closet Megadeth fan. I always sort of felt like I was betraying Metallica by listening to them, but just couldn't help myself. They were that good. I would sneak into music stores, head held down to buy Megadeth CD's and I would be out of that store like the wind. They have been a guilty pleasure of mine for years. A testament to how good they actually are. When I heard Dave was writing an autobiography, I dismissed it as another means of bad talking James and Lars, so I decided to pass on reading it. This year however, I lost the love of my life to a disease related to alcoholism. I decided I wanted to try to read Dave's book to mainly find out about his road to recovery from drugs and alcohol. I have a newfound respect for people who are able to accomplish this having lived through it with someone I loved. I was very surprised by what I learned. Yes, there is definitely a lot of resentment still towards Metallica; however, he didn't really bash them that badly. He was actually much harder on himself. I also found myself empathizing more with how he must have felt all of these years. It has certainly made me realize that we are shaped, good or bad, from our childhoods and every person we meet and experience we have. Dave continuously was knocked down and always, always got up, dusted himself off and persevered. I am actually quite impressed with him and have a deep respect for him. Metallica will always be my number one, however, the next time I go into a music store to buy a Megadeth CD, my head will be held high and I will be proud to be their fan. I may even make some banter with the cashier about how great Dave Mustaine is. Dave, job well done with both this book and your life.both this book and your life.
B0052WSX32|5.0|So of course, she didn't record those songs now. After all, Doris is 87 years old I believe and it probably would be very hard for her at this age to be able to record an entire album. But no matter what, this is still Doris Day and I found this collection of songs absolutely delightful. To make it even better, she speaks a few words about her son and introduce a song he wrote and sings. And like his Mother his voice is enchanting. I may not be writing a very sophisticated review here but all I mean to say is that any real fan of Doris will love this CD.

B004RJMUJO|1.0|I paid for this on the Google Market and now I regret it. Paid version is the least updated version, free is riddled with ads, and on top of that, they prefer their iPhone users over Android. I have tried emailing them twice with no response at all. I have little faith in this company, and would urge people to not bother with Halfbrick Studios.
4770030096|5.0|As a linguist for the past 35 years, I have found that the entire series, \\"Japanese for Busy People\\", undoubtedly comprises the most outstanding language learning material that has ever been published in any language.  It is obvious that a prodigious commitment was made in order to successfully compile such a user friendly, organized and efficient course, which deserves prominant world recognition
1451629184|5.0|I have never written a book review...frankly, I haven't sat thru a book and read it cover to cover since college (which is embarrasing to admit, but it is the truth). However, something pulled me towards this book and her story since she was discovered in 2009. It took me less than a day to read this book and I too had a hard time putting it down. The first 1/4 of the book is very, very difficult to get thru in one sitting. I found myself having to put it down several times as the raw emotion you will feel is overwhelming. You can't help but put yourself in her experience as well as thinking of what you would do if other loved ones in your family had been abducted and thrust into this life. For me, it was my 4 year old niece...the thought of a sicko taking her and doing this to her was truely painful to fathom. I am Jaycee's age and I think that also played a part in my experience with this book. She mentions several times the feelings of \\"missing out\\" on certain milestones in life and it really makes you appreciate all those things in your life that may not of worked out \\"perfectly\\", but yet you are still afforded those experiences...these experiences Jaycee never had. The down to earth perspective this young woman has is heroic. Yes, she speaks often of animals and as a none animal lover, this did not bother me. Jaycee takes you back to the mind of an 11 year old and progresses you to her present age. It is impressive given her 5th grade education. I am glad she did not use a ghost writer, I believe her message would of been skewed. She writes this book as if you are in her shoes and that is what makes it so incrediably powerful. My heart was broken for her for much of the book, but in the end she turns this into a true miracle of strength and dare I say it, a happy ending. Which I found to be impossible when I began to read it. The biggest message I took from this book is we are all dealt a hand in life, sometimes fair, sometimes not fair... and it's not the handwe are dealth that matters, but how we handle it. I will never forget her story. Ever.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|I read all of Vonneguts books in high school, 35 years ago. A few years ago I picked up one of his books and found it kind of dated. Then on a whim I reread Cat's Cradle. It is so Vonnegut. For fans, that is probably enough description. He presents his view of the human condition in a way that will make you like the characters, most of whom are bumblers. He does present strong views, but never in a way that make you feel preached at, but in a way that leaves you laughing at first, and then rechewing the ideas later. This book is definately not dated, and now I am in love with the author all over again. I am thinking he is an author that should be required high school reading, a lot more entertaining than being forced to read Beowulf!

1594744769|4.0|I would have given this book 5 stars, because I truly loved the story peppered with quirky vintage photos, but it lacked as a Kindle version.

I did think this was an amazingly creative story, though and I can't wait for the sequal!!!
0142419400|5.0|Anna Oliphant is starting her senior year in high school.  She should be extatic, but she's not; her father has enrolled her in a French boarding school for American students.  She's leaving behind her best friend, Bridgette, and her latest crush, Toph, the cute guy at work who she finally kissed the night before she left for Paris.  She's alone and doesn't know anyone, doesn't speak French, and just wants to go home to Atlanta.<br /><br />She does make friends, of course, and even while she's pining for Toph, she develops a crush on Etienne St. Clair, one of the guys in her group of friends.  She thinks he might feel the same, but St. Clair has a girlfriend; she graduated last year and attends a local Parisian college.  It shouldn't be complicated, right?  But it sooo is...<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />It's ALWAYS the books that I put off reading that I end up adoring.  Anna and the French Kiss is like hot chocolate (chocolat chaud) on a cold winter day:  It warmed my heart, made me smile, and I didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />Sophie Perkins has written a wonderful story about a teenage girl who's learning that although things change, they're not always bad.  Her cast of characters are well-rounded and each of them brings something special to the story.  Besides the witty writing and sweet story line, though, I think what I liked best is that Anna is a character that I can relate to.  I remember those feelings of insecurity and just feeling so...awkward.  Her fears about being an American in France are comically endearing.  I also swooned with Anna over St. Clair, he was  so charming and sweet had his own problems to deal with.<br /><br />As you probably guessed from the title, Anna and the French Kiss is set in Paris, and Ms. Perkins does a wonderful job of highlighting all the parts of Paris I hope to one day see for myself.  There were several scenes that took place in the city, notably a very sweet scene when St. Clair takes Anna on a brief tour of the city to assuage her fear of leaving the school's campus.<br /><br />In case I haven't made it clear yet, I absolutely recommend Anna and the French Kiss; it's definitely going on my Keeper Shelf.  I plan to read more books by Ms. Perkins, starting with the next book in this series, Lola and the Boy Next Door, on shelves September 29.ng the school's campus.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|THE WALKING DEAD is an exciting, innovative and very original series.  High kudos to AMC.  THE WALKING DEAD takes the zombie theme and brings it to a brand new level with intense drama and characters with depth and feeling the viewer can relate to.  The show sucks you in from the first second of the pilot.  And rest assured, there is blood and guts and gore galore but even with how great those scenes are it is the rest of the show that rules.  The story is more about the survivors.  It is thru their stories and interpersonal relationships that the heart and also true suspense and drama of the show lives.<br /><br />The blu ray is amazing.  The video presentation is superb.  The picture is intentionally a little grainy which adds to its effect while the clarity and sharpness of the picture brings everything to life.  Colors are bright and realistic.  Close-ups are very crisp and flesh tones very realistic.  The scenes with the dead are mezmerizing as the colors of their lifeless walking bodies mesh with the realistic blood and gore in the action sequences.  And the audio is also superb.  Dialogue is strong and the menacing scenes come to life utilizing all surround speakers.  It's a whole other dimension from watching it on tv or dvd.  Bottom line, this is a scary zombie series that comes to life due to the heart and soul of the human characters.  It is about survival, love, acceptance and trust.  Writing and directing are of course superb.  Highly recommend this series and the blu ray transcends it to a new level.
0307277887|3.0|There is a lot of hype surrounding Darkly Dreaming Dexter. It has some very high praise by a lot of critics out there. There is an ongoing award-winning TV series based off it, which I have not seen. So, when I delved into Dexter's smooth narration, I didn't know what to expect. As we all know, most books with this amount of hype around them don't turn out to be as good.<br /><br />Darkly Dreaming Dexter is about a serial killer and a blood spatter analyst who works for the Miami Metro Police. Problem is, they are one and the same. By day Dexter is a charming nerd, and by night his Dark Passenger leads him as he hunts for his prey. But he doesn't kill just anyone. He only kills people who are guilty of murder. He never kills the innocent.<br /><br />Emotionless, Dexter walks the earth fully aware of his own inhumanity. He doesn't have a conscience, but he does have a code, created for him by his father.<br /><br />It's safe to day that Darkly Dreaming Dexter has a clever premise, to say the least. At first I didn't know how comfortable I'd feel rooting for a serial killer, no matter how his actions were justified. But Lindsay doesn't take the route of trying to explain away Dexter evil deeds. He embraces them. Dexter (who narrates the story) is fully aware of what he is doing. It's the fact that he has no emotions that keeps him from caring. He does it only to fulfill his need to kill.<br /><br />At the same time, he's a very likable character. It might be that we, as the readers, see glimpses of humanity flicker across his eyes every so often, but he's just plain likeable. He likes kids, and he does hold a place in his heart for his stepsister Deborah Morgan (he was adopted) who also works for Miami Metro. It's little things like that that allows us to care for this quirky and horrifying character that is Dexter. The fact that he narrates the story as well I think adds to it as well.<br /><br />But I think the aspect that solidifies us caring about him, is the factthat he struggles. It's not his fault he's like this, after all. Something happened in his past, but he (and we) doesn't know what it is. He can't help it. The need to kill (what he calls the dark passenger) is always lurking in the back of his brain, and he must kill to satisfy it.<br /><br />Now that I've gone over Dexter's character in depth, and we now that he is a very interesting and compelling one, I'd like to go over how he is developed, and how the story he is in works.<br /><br />Firstly, I'd like to give Jeff Lindsay due credit for creating this fascinating character that defies the clichéd run-of-the-mill cardboard cutouts we have all too often today. Plus he does a great job of setting of the premise of the story in which Dexter is placed. He sets up a quirky bunch of side characters, and a gritty location. The atmosphere is ripe, and the tension is high as Dexter tries to juggle the various aspects of his life (did I tell you he has a girlfriend so that he can fit in?).<br /><br />But as the story progresses... that's just it. The story progresses. Nothing more. Dexter continues to be a contemplative emotionless self, the side characters bumble around, and the only real interaction is between Dexter, Deborah, and Detective LaGuerta, who works with Miami Metro. Yes, there certainly is a complex touchy relationship between the three of them, but it never really goes anywhere.<br /><br />In a book like this where the central idea is the main character, not the plot, you have to develop your characters and have your characters' relationships develop as well.<br /><br />On the flip side, it seems Lindsay, at the same time, moves Dexter along too quickly. He is described as cold and logical. Never subject to stupidity and anxiety of the human race. So we're told. But that's all. Jeff Lindsay doesn't show us this. We're shown, later on Dexter changing from his normal routine. But we haven't even seen him in his routine yet, so why should we be surprised when he breaks the routine? In the specific instance I'm referring to, Dexter does something very horrifying and quite disgusting. It does nothing to make him a more likable person.<br /><br />Over the course of the book I found myself caring less for Dexter, and getting rather annoyed with him. Toward the end there is a conflict where he is about to let down his sister, something that would result in a very bad thing (I don't want to spoil anything). I found this completely unbelievable. Over the course of the book Dexter constantly says that while he doesn't love, per se, he would never let his sister down. And this, for once, is shown, not only told. Lindsay puts the only relationship we care about at risk, and not by outside forces.<br /><br />Lindsay really rushed the climax of the book. This is the result of undeveloped characters and plot. The book should have been a hundred pages longer. That way, Lindsay could have kept a good pace, taken his time to develop solid characters, and made the ending not only believable, but also satisfying.<br /><br />In the end, all we get is a really great set up of both characters and plot, and loads of potential along the way with possible a redeeming aspect to it, but all of this is wasted. Before I go, I would like to say that I did like the writing style. I thought it worked very well for the book, and was highly entertaining. It makes me even more sad to give Darkly Dreaming Dexter a poor review.
055357342X|3.0|I liked the first three books better than this fourth one.  This one is rambly and a bit boring and I am eager to find out about my more favorite characters.  We all are more interested in Bran, Jon and Dany.  (And Tyrion!)    The next book will make up for all, I'm sure.      Still, all the books so far are good. Some are better than that.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Sometimes bands just seem to do everything right. Symphony X is basically a band like that. _Iconoclast_ is a brilliant prog-metal album. First of all, the band sounds tighter than ever and the production is really heavy, really METAL. It's sound is very similar to _Paradise Lost_. You know when bands suddenly gets 'heavier' on an album or two, and the heavier albums are the best albums? Yeah, this is like that. However, the band retains its knack for amazing vocals, melodic hooks, and songwriting that closes on your skull like a bear trap snapping shut. Not to mention some downright rippin' prog-metal breakdowns, face-melting solos, and a big, epic, \\"Rise of the Machines\\" kind of theme. There's an absolutely brilliant 'power ballad', \\"When All Is Lost\\". And that's saying a lot when you think of crazy songs that might be in that category, such as \\"Candlelight Fantasia,\\" \\"Lady of the Snow\\", \\"Awakenings\\", \\"Paradise Lost\\", \\"Edge of Forever\\" maybe... anyway. You know, a lot of the album sounds kinda 'the same' at first, and it's long which doesn't help that initial impression (2-disc version is mandatory, if you get the 1-disc set you are stupid). But that is only at first, because give it some attention and the music reveals all the brilliant layers that make awesome prog-metal so tasty (especially with this emphasis on METAL and great hooks). I've listened to this to death since it was released and it fills me with joy. This is probably Symphony X's most _perfect_ album so everything else they release after this is just gravy. Well maybe the last song could have been a wee bit more epic and huge but it's still excellent so oh well. And one final comments, even after all these years there are still reviews that say Symphony X has \\"stupid\\" or \\"bad\\" lyrics, but come on, what do you expect, Edgar Allan Poe? It's a metal band, writing about (in this case) evil machine empires (or something) messing $&@% up. The lyrics are actually AWESOME when you think about it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this app all the time, and it's smooth,  never force closes and let's me read books....  That's all I need it to do,  so a big thumbs up from me
B005ER6SNM|5.0|Where do you even start with a review for this movie? This might not even qualify as a \\"review\\" in the typical sense. Well to explain my \\"paradigm\\" from which I'm coming from, let me say i've always had a fascination with violence and \\"disturbing content\\" on film and in the media. So I've seen a lot of \\"horror movies\\" but also a lot of other weird things. I've explored the worst of the worst but virtually never is there a film where violence is used to inflict really, really soul-scarring damage. That is because, you see, most \\"extreme\\" violence films are what I would call \\"Trashy\\". This can refer to the poor quality of their presentation, but more often it refers to an attitude about violence. Violence used for entertainment, I think, is perfectly okay and sometimes very awesome. On the other hand, violence as a tool to evoke a different emotional effect has an entirely different effect on us as a viewer. And I have always been interested in those latter kinds of things. I don't know why. Humans have always had that curiosity, they just externalize it differently.<br /><br />Most of the \\"most disgusting/violent/disturbing movies\\", according to the internet, are actually in this \\"trashy\\" category, so they aren't _really_ all that disgusting or violent or disturbing. They are just dumb and do not create an emotional effect beyond something superficial and shallow. Often they are just bad movies so they generate contempt for wasting anyone's time. They certainly do not create a real sense of HORROR or TERROR. And you know, I have always wanted to find the pinnacle of _really_ disturbing/violent films for years now.<br /><br />That movie is definitely _A Serbian Film_, without any doubt. I will not discuss the story at all or refer in detail to any specific scenes. I don't even really think anyone should watch this movie, and you can go read more about it elsewhere. I'm not really here to make this movie sounds interesing so that you go watch it, and honestly the basic premise is pretty clever so if I avoid that issue it's probably for the best.<br /><br />But I will say -- without hesitation but still feeling a bit weird about it -- _Serbian Film_ is a MASTERPIECE. It is the scariest film of all time, easily. The way it creates an emotional attachment, establishes an atmosphere of utter, paralyzing dread, and its escalation from one unbelievably devastating, brutal, and shocking scene to another, is really, really effective. This movie really really, really terrifying. In terms of craftsmanship, the filmmakers really deserve credit. They know what makes a good horror film, and then they just raised the intensity and brutality to infinity and beyond. The level of depravity and cruelty inflicted upon people in this movie is really unimaginable to the average person. Your heart will feel like it's going to explode about halfway into the film... and then it gets way worse. I almost couldn't bear to see what was going to happen in the end (although it's somewhat predictable, which actually makes it WORSE as the end approaches), but I did and it sucked. No, the ending did not suck in the sense that it was \\"bad\\", because it was a good ending in terms of climactic narrative, but in the sense that it BAD -- like \\"that's the worst thing I can ever imagine happening\\" kind of BAD.<br /><br />Some people will jump in at this point and say, \\"Oh well it can't be as bad as X\\". No, shut up. You don't know what you're talking about. It's way, way worse than X. I promise you, I have seen all those obscure movies you scour google for days and weeks to find. \\"Oh but have you seen--?\\" Yes, I've seen it. \\"But i bet you haven't seen--\\". No, _i've seen that too_. And it's mostly trash.<br /><br />But here is why this movie is not \\"trash\\". First of all, it is extremely well made. The acting is very effective, the writing is sharp (even with some nice moments of tenderness and humor early on). But most importantly the story, which is probably not very realistic or anything, is completely absorbing and it makes the viewer care. We can appreciate the main character's situation. He seems to be a likable dude. We want good things to happen to him and his family. But, then he is lured in by what seems to be a good opportunity and becomes quite literally enslaved to evil. Our empathy becomes horror magnified a thousandfold by the fact that we give a damn, and by the unbelievable intensity of evil perpetrated -- manipulating someone into doing something they would never do, something that is so vile that even talking about it will make you puke.<br /><br />It almost makes you forget that you are watching this movie because it's supposedly the \\"nastiest ever\\" and not because it's just a good movie. Almost. But then it beats you like a sledgehammer as a good movie AND the nastiest.<br /><br />And yet here is the paradox. This is not really a good movie, like \\"I recommend this\\" or \\"I would watch this again.\\" In that sense, it is the worst movie. But because it is the best worst movie, it is actually amazing. But your soul will be shattered when you watch it. The ending is literally the most horrible thing ever on film. I will certainly never, EVER watch it again. Just thinking about it makes me feel bad. But I cannot deny that it is incredibly powerful on its own terms, and it has to be taken seriously. This is not like our normal horror movies where violence is really part of the fun. But here with _Serbian Film_, you dread violence like you do in real life. That is a powerful effect and I can count the number of movies like that on one hand. All possible goodness in this movie is utterly broken, corrupted, and destroyed by the end, through abject violence. Your soul bleeds into the ether as the credits roll.<br /><br />Is this movie \\"deep\\" or interpretative on some level? I don't know. Maybe it doesn't matter. \\"This is a diary of our own molestation by the Serbian government... It's about the monolithic power of leaders who hypnotize you to do things you don't want to do. You have to feel the violence to know what it's about.\\" Those are the words of the director. Take them for whatever they're worth. Indeed, truly horrible things happen to people in real life. Real horror is real people dying and suffering and being forced to do awful things with real consequences. In that sense, this movie is not that bad. No one died. No one got hurt. No actual children were exposed to anything inappropriate. But by drawing on some a real sense of loss and tragedy and horror they grew up with, the filmmakers create a really powerful horror film. I find that interesting.<br /><br />My heart is racing just thinking about this movie. I feel like i could faint. Why did I even write this review? It makes no sense, i gave it 5-stars saying no one should see it and you will be scarred by it and probably react negatively _even if you normally dig this stuff_. Seriously. I could give it one-star and have the same content for this review. Another reviewer somewhere said it best, \\"You don't want to see this movie. You only think you do.\\" Be careful. You can't go back in time and un-watch this movie after you watch it.  And so in seeing _A Serbian Film_, my quest for the most violent and disturbing film of all time is over. After seeing this movie, I am reduced to spending the rest of my days watching nice happy things like episodes of \\"Sailor Moon\\".rbing and it makes the viewer care.

B000FC1IPO|4.0|I bought the book based on the movie trailer.  I think that they've made the story seem as though it's just a comedy, but it's more than that.  This story is pretty real for a lot of women.<br /><br />Kate is your typical modern woman - wife, mother, working woman - who feels as though she is always shortchanging someone.  If she's at work, she isn't with her family.  If she's with her family, she is still anxious about work and checks in with it constantly.  And her marriage rarely makes the her list of things-to-do.<br /><br />Kate also has become wrapped up in what her job allows her to buy, rather than what she is giving up to have those things:  time with her family and friends, as well as time for herself.<br /><br />For most women, we're the caregivers in our lives.  We take care of everyone but ourselves.  What we need to learn is that if we take care of ourselves and are happy, the people around us will be too.<br /><br />There is a lot of heartache mixed in with laughter in this novel.  It reminds me a bit of Emily Giffin's writings.  I look forward to seeing more from this author.

B004LWZW4C|4.0|In X1 there was the attempt by Magneto (played superbly by Ian McKellan) to convert humans to mutants. In X2 it was a plot by a corrupt Fed to kill all the mutants using Xavier (Patrick Stewart). In X3 a \\"cure\\" is found that makes all mutants human. Cure indeed. Who said the mutants were sick?<br /><br />So what lead up to all the excellence that was held within the first 3 movies? Well, you got a little taste with [[ASIN:B001GCUO16 X-Men Origins: Wolverine]], and X-Men: First Class brings the stories full circle to document young Magneto's (Michael Fassbender in this prequel) and Xavier's (James McAvoy) life and relationship with each other. We also get introduced to young versions a few of our other favorite X-Men (and women) and the formation of their individual \\"mutant philosophies\\" and allegiances.<br /><br />Who knew that the Cuban Missile Crisis and the ultimate aversion of World War 3 were a direct result of mutant intervention? How? Watch X: First Class and you'll find out. The story is well told, well acted and, just like all of the X-Men movies out to date, suspenseful and exciting. Special effects are 5-stars.<br /><br />No bathroom break urges in X: First Class. Besides you don't want to be out of the room for the cool blink of an eye cameo!<br /><br />X fans won't miss this, and you shouldn't either if you're into the action, sci-fi or fantasy genres. Overall...X-Men: First Class is a first class prequel. Check it out.

It uploads the mp3s into iTunes, so if that isn't your music library preference, you can simply move the files to where you ultimately want them once the uploading is done.    I find the sound quality is quite good as well. Admittedly, I haven't found the need to use the included Audacity software, as I found the EZ Vinyl Tape Converter software to meet my needs.

1439102813|4.0|When I first saw this book was about Alzheimer's Disease I expected it to have a hopeful happy ending. But I loved that it didn't. Too many books lately seem to end on a happy note, even when they realistically wouldn't, and it was refreshing to read a novel that showed Alzheimer's as it actually is.    Having recently lost a family member to this disease, it was interesting to read from Alice's perspective... to see how her life was gradually unraveling and there were days when she knew it was happening and others when she had no idea. Just reading this book and reading through the memory lapses had me frustrated, so I can't imagine what it would be like to live with Alzheimer's.    Overall I think this book did a great job at giving a voice to an increasingly common disease. So many of us who watch loved ones struggle with this never understand how they're feeling since they're unable to tell us. This book shares the struggle and frustration with us and gives us all a glimpse into the mind of someone living with Alzheimer's.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It has been a while since I found a page-turner. This story was very engaging. The author does a great job of weaving some element of mystery into the story. It was a fun read, playing along and attempting to decipher the pop-culture references along the way.    The novel is perfect for an entire generation of nerds and geeks that grew up in the primitive age of video gaming, sitcoms, and hair bands. The novel would also have some appeal to younger readers that are caught up in current MMOs.    As the novel concludes, the last chapter leaves the reader with a satisfying unanswered question. One immediately asks himself, what would I do? It is thought provoking and really drives home the idea that we need a balance between reality and escapism.
0553103547|5.0|Excellent book. The story has you eager to read on and on. Easy read that really draws you into the story and bind with the characters. Heart wrenching at times. The Author does tend to get a little carried away describing what the characters are wearing but not without color. That is the only draw back. This story is a great story that really sucks you into the times and places. And it can make you hungry!!

B005974CNA|5.0|This Dream Theater CD is the one that represents the place in time where they cast off their immature little brother and settle into the comfort zone they have wanted to be in since 2003's Train of Thought. There are some really fantastic songs on this album, including \\"On the Backs of Angels\\", \\"This is the Life\\" and \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\". Twenty plus years into this, these guys are all accomplished musicians and they can really write the songs. There is definitely a certain sound that you expect from Dream Theater and \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\" does not disappoint in this regard. Only occasionally, when they fly off into those obligatory musical interludes in order to demonstrate their virtuosity do you sometimes pause to wonder, 'I think they done that before' or 'That doesn't fit quite right'. It is only in these moments that the Dream Theater method maybe seems a little too formulaic. Like many bands who have lasted so long and so successfully, that initial burst of youthful creativity has been replaced by a mature sense to the songwriting. Only in this case, the Portnoy influence had somewhat retarded this progression for the past few albums. Thankfully, gone now are the juvenile and overused themes, the way too loud rolling base drums, and the unnecessary vocals. I'm just a fan, but Portnoy was starting to become annoying even to me. This brings me to the bonus DVD in the special edition. The drummer auditions were interesting to watch (I couldn't help but smile watching Marco Minnemann on the drumkit), and you gain a little insight into the thinking of Dream Theater, but even more telling was how they portrayed Portnoy's departure. You would think the guy died! In the end, I guess he did. He's certainly dead to Dream Theater. They have moved on. And it's a good place.<br /><br />Afternote: I don't want to come across as a complete Portnoy basher. He certainly is a talented drummer and I will continue to enjoy and admire his work in the Dream Theater catalog.

0756686970|5.0|We started with the DK book on Lego Star Wars sets, that includes the Luke mini figure. My son loves it and 4 weeks later is still reading it nightly before bed. It was a 5 star product, especially at the Amazon price. This is now our 4th DK book as we picked up the Lego Harry Potter book and Clone Wars character encyclopedia in the last month as well.     This book is smaller in physical size then the other two lego books. It is the same size as the Clone Wars encyclopedia and like that book has about 200 pages. Also like the Clone wars book, each character gets their own page and the layout is very similar to that book. The mini fig is pictured in a large layout form and usually the set (or sets) from which it comes are pictured in smaller form. There are about 4-6 little trivia facts about details on the figure itself, that are perfect for my 1st grader to work on his reading. There is also a small trivia box about the set it comes from, another about the number it is assigned/year issued, and usually a bigger trivia box with an overview of the character.     Unlike his earlier DK book on lego star wars sets, this one just got released (september 2011) and is up to date on the figures and sets from 2011. My son has the Plo Koon star fighter and both Plo Koon, his Droid, and his ship are included. In the other book (which is still outstanding) his set is only mentioned in a timeline they updated in the front of the book, but not in the book itself. So if your little one wants to look up minifigs from something he just picked up a week ago, it would be in here. The only one I am aware of not in here is the \\"little Han\\" figure which came with the Walmart blu-ray release of the padawan menace last week.     I have reviewed all 4 of the DK books now and I think they are all great. My little guy gets his love of both Legos and Star Wars from me, and I also like paging through these books. This book, like the others, is great and the price on Amazon was equally nice. Again my son loves to read these and in his mind they are as good as toys. He is thrilled to practice his reading every night because of these books. If I could give this one (and the others)6 stars, I would.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|It's over due! Lucas should keep on making Star Wars Films like what they did on Harry Potter. If he is too lazy to Direct & Write them, there are Lots & Lots of unemployed Talents out there who can do it for him. Funding the new Films wont be an issue, I bet you, All producers would want to bank on this Franchise, because it' will be an instant success.<br /><br />Star Wars Universe has so much potential for a New and Exciting Stories. Honestly, I'm TIRED of Anakin & Luke. I want to see the Next Generation Jedi's on the Big Screen. Solo & Leia's twin kids Jaina and Jacen would be Awesome. Or, a Han Solo & Wookie one shot Film. Anything as long as it's not about Vader, Anakin & Luke.<br /><br />So for now, I'd say, NO to this Blu-Ray Gimmick.<br /><br />Give us something new then we will give you our money(=<br /><br />Thanks!<br />STRALLENT*COM
B004L03B3S|2.0|The movie did not connect with me on any emotional level.  I Kept fast forwarding to see if it got better - it did not. I got that the brothers were in love and found it difficult to be apart.  I got that the parents identified that the bond between the boys was very strong - maybe more than brotherley love. I did not feel any emotional connections with parents, children, situation, NOTHING.  To me it was a waste of money and I will not be sucked into believing the blurb on a cover, ever again.

B005LMEB8E|1.0|I was truly inspired to listen to Demi a bit more after hearing the passion and heart that came with the wonderful single Skyscraper.  I went back and listened to some of her older stuff and realised it was the same old over produced, over modulated, unoriginal pop that floods the teeny bopper airwaves for all those with no educated musical tastes.    Skyscraper was great and I was excited, a major turn for the better, great sound, great vocals, original ideas with a Demi twist for the much better.    Then the rest of the album comes out, I buy it, I play it and couldn't even make it past the second song first time around.  I have relistened to it to give it a fair shake, but the disappointment just continued to multiply, song after song. I get to Skyscraper, love it, the disappointment all over again..     Sorry Demi, so much potential in you, Such an awesome voice by itself.  I cannot wait until you grow out of this type of music that does nothing to highlight your beautiful voice, it actually covers it up with what seems like endless over producing..    I will be giving my album to my niece, that's if she'll want it.
B005CM9DX6|4.0|The new Opeth cd 'Heritage' is sure to be a controversial one among their fanbase, as it is definitely a departure from what they've done in the past, but I think it's an amazing musical journey for those willing to take it. I think the reactions will be:  1. Metal fans, who like Opeth because they are SO great at being heavy, will in general not like this record because for the most part the heaviness is gone.  2. Prog rock fans who have enjoyed Opeth in the past but couldn't get past the death metal vocals will probably love this.  3. Hardcore Opeth fans will be split, you'll either love it or hate it.  Personally, I think they've done something very brave and challenging. It's not 'Damnation' which was basically an acoustic album. There are heavy parts here, but the general vibe is a sort of jazz meets prog-rock. The musicianship is stunning, and the songs, once you give them a chance to work their way into your head, are amazing. But there is not instant gratification to be found here, you need to give this a few listens before you really start to hear how brilliant it is.   I am, as a huge Opeth fan, thrilled that they've made this interesting record, and can't wait to see if this is a permanent new direction, a temporary left turn, or a sound that they will incorporate with what they've done in the past moving forward. Either way, count me in, i'm along for the ride!!! But no rush, I am more than happy to spend plenty of time with 'Heritage.'!!!
B000NSJ4Q0|5.0|To get this out of the way up front, yes it's expensive relative to the cheap knockoffs.  However what you get with the Canon branded unit is a guarantee of quality that you don't get with the others.  You have a $500 flash on a $1500 camera with an $800 lens at a contracted event you're making $3000 off of, and you want to gamble all of that on saving $80 on a no-name battery pack?  Not wise.<br /><br />Additionally, this pack is much safer to use with your expensive Canon flashes than the Quantum battery packs.  The Quantum packs are much more powerful and can recycle the flash at such a high rate that the bulb actually burns up.  For casual flash users, this is probably a non-issue, but it can happen and it's definitely something to consider.<br /><br />I've used this pack on a 580EX and 580EXII flash for the past few years and it's worked great.  It reduces recycling time by probably 70% and greatly increases the number of shots you can get to a charge.  No, you can't tell how fresh the batteries are, but at a wedding (I use it mainly for receptions), I have not run a CP-E4 completely dead in the 4 years I've used it.  So long as you recharge it before the start of the event, I don't see anyone running one completely dead under normal usage.<br /><br />Generally, this pack is going to be most useful if you do rapid flash discharges at higher power.  When using lower power discharges at higher ISO, you might as well leave it in the camera bag.  However if you are planning on capturing a critical moment that is going to require many frames in rapid succession, this battery pack provides a HUGE level of insurance that you're flash is going to be up to the task.  If you've ever missed a shot due to your flash recycling time being too slow, you know how frustrating it is.<br /><br />Just to be clear, this pack only works on Canon's high end flashes, the 550EX, 580EX, 580EXII, MT-14, MT24, and a couple of the older \\"EZ\\" model flashes.  This will not work on any model of 430ex or 420ex flashes.<br /><br />Overall, this is an essential piece of camera gear for the working professional.  The functionality is huge, the price is relatively low, and the resale value of this thing is high.verall, this is an essential piece of camera gear for the working professional.

B000244FDW|4.0|This is an enjoyable version of P & P, of which I have seen four.  Only the short version made years ago is inadequate in many respects.  The three more recent versions all have superior characterizations in one or more aspects, in my judgment.  There is no version, unless I have carelessly overlooked something, which portrays Lydia as the \\"tallest\\" of the five Bennet sisters,  which Jane Austen's character asserts in the book.      I do not think the longest version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth will ever be equalled for its sheer beauty of filming, depth of character development,  and, for me at least, the very moving scene of Elizabeth's visit to Pemberley.  I do prefer the choice made by this version for Jane.  The story repeatedly refers to Jane as being the most beautiful of the Bennet girls, but is not accurate in my preferred version.  This version has it better.  Although the treatment of George Wickham is quite well done here, the lack of time available does not allow it to match up to my preferred version.  The same is true of Mr. Collins.    There is so much which could be said about this immensely popular story.  I will surely return again to watch this version from time to time, though it is not the best.

0385534639|3.0|The Night Circus is overhypedmake no mistake. A solid debut for a first time author, it lacks the polish and experience to transform it from a good story into a poignant one. I'll address the strengths and weaknesses of Miss Morgenstern's freshmen debut and leave the judgement up to you.    Strengths:  Concept: The world of the Night Circus takes place during the late 19th century and early 20th century. When a mysterious circus enters the town without warning, all flock to it and gaze upon the illusions and black and white decor. A spellbinding world where magic appears to be one thing when it's something else entirely.    Description: I'm divided on the description Morgenstern employs throughout the book. It's beautifully worded and filled with enchanting similes, but sometimes those similes border on pompous and confusing. More down to earth phrasing or comparisons could have helped but I'll grant her the concession it would break the novel's illusionary theme and imagery if she didn't employ it.    The Circus: The upside to the Night Circus is the circus itself. In some stories the city or setting acts as a main character. With magic abound in every corner, dark and melancholy secrets swirling behind the scenes, Morgenstern masters atomsphere and a place you want to come back too.    Weaknesses:    Plot: Unforunately, The Night Circus's primary plot fizzles due to the focus on the Circus through it's fluff descriptions. The main characters, the two dueling magicians, don't have much in term of development or depth. The romance is stiff. There's subtleness to it with their apprecation of each others's magic gifts consisting of their \\"courtship\\" in the first half. Marco throughout the story employs what one reviewer mentioned as fireworks. There's little sense of suspense and the ending leaves me dissastified overall.     Prose: Part of the problem is the present tense 3rd person and the choose your own adventure 2nd person for the parts Morgenstern describes to you. In a sense, you are a background patron to the Circus throughout these descriptions. It breaks the immersion of the novel, for me at least. And the present tense lacks the power of the past tense. The long descriptions don't reach purple prose but the novel could have been cut by 50-100 pages of what some writers call fluff. Self-indulgent description about every little detail that's superflous to the plot and characters hurts the novel.    note: This is my own bias showing through. I prefer the iceberg principle employed by Hemmingway. Not the short choppy sentences but rather letting the reader fill in the blanks on certain secondary elements to create a sense of mystery and wonder about the Circus.     Characters: There are too many to count. Characters fade in and out of the background and share the cryptic and mysterious archetype too often. The protagonists show potential but with their fates tied to the competition, it doesn't allow for many \\"quiet moments\\". The kind of character building conversations and scenes where the action moves at a methodical pace and still keeps the plot moving. There are certain gem characters that stand out but they're underutilized.    Morgenstern deserves accolodes for her concept and setting. She still has a long way to go in terms of characterization and plot but that's the point of sophmore novel. Writing a smash hit freshman novel is rare; and the Night Circus casts an enchanting illusion that  doesn't last long enough for the reader to give their time to it. I give it a 3/5.
0684859106|1.0|I couldn't wait to get this book. I was so excited because everyone on television talked it up. There isn't a recipie in this book you don't already have in your cookbooks. What a disappointment.    They have almond crescents that have almond and vanilla extracts, but no almonds or nuts. No pecan crescents, no baklava. Every cookie and cake is in one of my church/community cookbooks. Dump cake, Chocolate cake, chocolate wafer cake...etc.    Do yourself and save your money.
1401310400|5.0|I didn't expect much from the book, and checked it out from the library as a lark. Perhaps it was because I had such low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was an enjoyable book. It is not a deep work of fiction, but if you enjoy a fast-paced mystery it is actually good. I do think that it would stand on its own, but have to say that as a fan of the show, I couldn't help but picture the actors as I read. It's difficult to say whether that made the book more enjoyable or not. It even had some of the witticisms that make the Castle character so enjoyable.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Overall this is a pretty good blu ray set. I STILL WANT THE UNALTERED TRILOGY, but until we get the original trilogy unaltered, this is the best looking and sounding Star Wars we have. The packaging is also pretty nice.<br /><br />The picture quality was surprisingly good, especially the original trilogy. The restoration job done here was pretty amazing. The picture quality in the prequels was nice as well, but that was almost expected. There is some DNR in The Phantom Menace, and a little less in Attack of the Clones. The picture quality in Revenge of the Sith shines, as it is the best in the set. Now I just want to see the original trilogy unaltered with this excellent transfer.<br /><br />The audio, across the board, is simply fantastic. The score and sound effects are amazing, and this sets trumps all other blu rays in the sound department. True demo material.<br /><br />Yes, the changes that Lucas make are infuriating, but I'm still glad I got this set. I hate Han shooting first, hate the \\"NOOOOOOO\\" and really get annoyed but the added CGI and useless silly creatures. But this is all we have right now and it looks and sounds great.<br /><br />The movies look and sound great, and are still enjoyable. The deleted scenes, the behind the scenes featurettes, the making-of features, and the commentaries are all great. I loved seeing these movies in their HD debut. If we can get an unaltered trilogy in the future, that would be icing on the cake.

B0059R5Q08|1.0|A noticeable step back from the both the 1983 BBC and the best version of all, 2007 Masterpiece Theatre, for these reasons:   First, it was a very noticeable read-a-line-of-script acting while holding the appropriate pose and meanwhile the person being spoken to waits like a statue for you to finish then they recite their line as if they are reading the script as if it's being held in front of them. Then on the director's cue there is a cut while he adds a comment before we proceed to the next exchange of lines, and so on. Very \\"Teleprompterish\\".   Second, the acting itself was just bland, wooden.   Third, there is something too artificial about period movies that use museum quality clothing, props, building and grounds. No dust, no dirt, no worn out anything - it's just not real. Even the grounds looked so trimmed it was like a stadium's artificial turf. Plus, outside of a couple of brief appearances by indoor servants, you see no one outside doing anything.   Fourth, there wasn't a cadence or emotional tone to the movie. It seemed like a placid level lake - just existing at the same pace.

B0055S348W|5.0|PrintShare is worth having if you want to print directly from your phone or tablet. You have a lot more control over output if you email or transfer your documents to a PC but PrintShare shines when you need to print certain content (call logs, messages, calendar entries, contacts) for which transfer may be difficult and output quality is not an issue.<br /><br />A few brief additional remarks:<br /><br />- PrinterShare adds a sometimes needed capability because, unlike more mature and much larger operating systems, Android does not support printing natively - after all, who would have thought 2 years ago that people may want to print 'stuff' off their phones or tablets?<br />- Not being integrated into the operating system explains PrinterShare's peculiar behavior. Instead of printing from within an app or by selecting 'print' from an object's list of available properties and actions, PrinterShare runs as a separate app that provides print support for a defined set of apps/objects: pictures, web pages, calendar, contacts, messages, call log, Gmail, Google docs and documents. In other words, you must run PrintShare every time you want to print something.<br />- The app supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, remote printers and cloud printers. Of these I tested the first 2 without problems. My printers were located and identified quickly, drivers were loaded and the output quality (printer's default) was good. However, the drivers ability to control a printer did not go much beyond sending the doc to the printer. Cloud and remote printing may provide additional flexibility but I haven't tested them.<br />- I had no problem printing images, PDF, Word and text files on an Epson Artisan and an HP OfficeJet Pro printer but I don't know how many or which specific printers are supported or which printers are not supported.<br /><br />Given that the app adds a needed capability to the operating system I can't hold the its developers responsible for lack of deep integration with the OS. This would not be needed if Android provided print support itself. The app's inability to fully control printers is also no surprising given that PrintShare's publisher has limited resources. Its limitations noted, this should be a 5-star for anyone who must be able to print off an Android device.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;provided print support itself.

B004GCKRWY|4.0|Movie hunk Ryan Reynolds stars in this film as Paul Conroy, an outside contractor operating a truck in Iraq. After an attack which leaves his friends dead, he awakens in a crude coffin with a butane lighter and a cell phone which is not fully charged. So begins this movie that is essentially telling the story of Conroy being held hostage for a hefty ransom while waging a battle against time to be rescued and dealing with increasingly irrational captors.<br />Given that Reynolds is the only actor that the audience sees during the film and that his stage is his cramped coffin/wood box, he manages to do a great job as the anxiety filled captive struggling to be rescued. And herein lies my problem. This movie is a nightmare for anyone who is claustrophobic. Reynolds did such a great job adapting to his film environment that I had a problem not feeling confined.<br />The script was clever and not completely predictable. At one point while Reynolds is in a frenzy to be located (remember he has no idea of exactly where he is because he didn't come to until he was already buried) the company he contracted with goes through a protracted process of firing him over his ebbing phone signal so they won't bear any responsibility regarding his kidnapping. While I had a problem with a couple aspects imbedded in the script, this was a taut thriller that managed to be suspenseful and terrifying.
B005E7AOHI|3.0|I've been a fan of Primus since seeing the video for John the Fisherman and saying to myself \\"What the hell is that guy doing to that bass!\\" I won't say I'm a die hard, but I appreciate this bands quirks and musical chops. That being said, Green Naugahyde just isn't what I wanted to hear after Primus being away for so long.  Despite my awe at Claypool's playing, I don't really care for his other work; I find them wanky and self indulgent. Primus is usually a good compromise between experimentation and listenability.  My biggest problem with this CD is that there isn't a good standout track that really grabs your attention. There isn't a John the Fisherman, or Tommy the Cat, or My name is Mud, or Anti-Pop here; it all moves along at the same pace. Some bands don't set out with the intent of writing singles, but if you listen to Sailing the Seas of Cheese or Anti-Pop, there are a lot of good memorable songs without them necessarily being written as just singles. This album reminds me more of a Tales From the Punchbowl or Brown Album, which from both albums I can only name one song of note.  My second problem is the production. Primus has been into producing their own stuff for a while, probably to maintain creative control. While the recording doesn't sound cheap like the Brown Album, it just isn't mixed very well. The bass is clunky, the vocals are too quiet, and Jay Lanes excellent drum work doesn't have any pop. Of course Larry's guitar is lost somewhere in the background, but that's usually the case. I personally think his best performance was on Anti-Pop. Les has apparently fallen in love with combining overdrive, bass synth and auto-wah, but it muddies his playing and gets old fast.   The highlights of Green Naugahyde are Jay Lanes drum work and the lyrics. Primus isn't known for direct social commentary, their lyrics are usually more whimsical, but this CD has some pretty harsh words for modern pop culture. I like it!    The bottom line is that hardcore Primusfans or Les Claypool worshipers will love this album. It's definitely Primus, which is still better than 70% of what's going on in the musical world today. I would have personally liked to see them do something what was more inline with Anti-Pop.
