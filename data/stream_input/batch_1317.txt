B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game. I love it it keeps me going. It's never boring. I love to play this over and over til I win.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Just like missle command from the way way back. Not too difficult to start and challenging at the end. Games last an eternity. Highly recommend.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great adaptation from the original. lots of fun. thanks for making this the free app of the day. gameplay on the fire is awesome!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun game. the new games cost too many points. so it gets boring after a while. word word word word word
020530902X|4.0|I got this book because somebody told me that I needed to read it to improve my own writing. Looking back at what I wrote before, they certainly had a point.<br /><br />Once I got to reading the little book I immediately got tons of ideas and I followed those instructions that were in it. Now I'm not getting criticism for my grammar faults and such; I get positives and they really like it. WOW! This book actually works. Now I'm getting somewhere.<br /><br />This book may not look much but it is vital if you want to improve immensely in a short time and you get more for your money than you'd originally think. If you intend on becoming a full-time author, carry this with you at all times. It'll help you make sure that every word you write tell something to the readers.<br /><br />I will make use of this for as long as I can.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Plays like the old game without trackball I have the Asus tablet I hope more of the old games are developed for android
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I barely got this app a few hours ago and I'm already addicted! I recommend also trying the gam Angry Chicken. Both games are totally rockin' awesome!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play solitaire on all kinds of devices, iphone, computer, kindle fire, and I've used different apps to play. This app is really good. In my opinion in most apps it is too easy to win. This app makes it difficult but not impossible. I like the winning deal feature so that when I'm frustrated with it I can use this feature and if I don't win easily I at least know I can win it!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|really worth it super easy to set up and a lot or fun. buy it if you're on the fence and you wont regret it.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Tried this one out first before buying multiples for our son.  He loves it. So we bought the giraffe and the puppy too!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Of all the missile command clones that I have played over the years, this is perhaps one of the best. Excellent performance, fast, and fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this app, I have only had for an hour or so but it is awesome! unlike some free apps that cut you off after beating a level, this one is completely free. it is great because the games have such a variety and they can be challenging!
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I'm not a movie snob or a wannabe film critic, but I really liked this film.  A feel from the 1970's,  and a soundtrack like it came out of the 80's (reverb on the snare....LOVE IT!)  The best way to watch this movie is to just let it unfold.  If you're one of those that likes to try to predict the outcome of movies (like several of my friends, which annoys me, as I watch a movie to be entertained not to \\"figure it out\\"), you won't like it...go watch the latest Hollywood blockbuster.  The story is not that deep, however, there is some vibe or untouchable \\"something\\" to the screenplay that just affects you on a more substantive, deeper level, it's very hard to explain.  It's almost a comparison to the British \\"angry young man\\" genre (similar, but not exactly like), which is one of my favorite types of historical fiction film.  I did find it odd that Christina Hendricks (of Mad Men fame) was so hyped up when she only had about a 10-minute part.  She's still very cute, though.  Also, the Mustang/Mopar car chase was a nice touch!  Kudos to whomever threw that in there...an enigmatic reference to [[ASIN:B001F4UHGC Bullitt]] whether it was intended or not!  Watch this one, you'll like it, VERY worth the small purchase price.
142314189X|5.0|I have read this whole series with my boys when we first found the Lightning Thief in a scholastic flier from school several years ago.  They reread them so much that the paperbacks fell apart.  I bought this hardback collection to replace them and it is made very well.  My husband didn't get why I would buy these since they had them before.  But it's like a favorite movie, you just keep going back to it over again and this set will hold up to the use.
0307010856|5.0|The book is so much fun to read, kids of all ages enjoy turning the pages while you can pretend to want to stop reading, because your scared.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great, lost on night 34. lol. Game play is solid. Progresses well through the levels. Simple and fun. I recommend d d d .
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|What was this one about?  I thought Brad Pitt & Sean Penn, no matter what anyone writes, I cannot go wrong.  I turned it off after 20 minutes...should have paid attention to the reviews.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Took me back to Atari days, but improved on the original through purchasing weapon upgrades vs fixing your city. Great game!  Got it for free app of the day, but had I known about it, I would have purchased it a while ago.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am new to Spider Solitaire &amp; love it! This app has beautiful graphics, works fast &amp; is the perfect enabler to my new addiction.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A good game to just pick up and play a few rounds. It reminds me of the old 2600 days.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|plays smooth fun addictive haven't had any problem with app on kindle fire. The controls are simple responds super well. If I had a do over I would get it again.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|extremely fun game, if you have a few minutes to kill this is the perfect game to waste it on.
B0001MLMKY|4.0|very elegant and simple watch.  Usual Swatch lightness.  Don't think the dial window material is mineral as described. Will find out when I get the first scratch.  Unbelievable how hard to find a simple watch that has day and date.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good missile defense game.  Gameplay is smooth and difficulty isn't frustrating but is challenging (especially once you get past level 30 or so). Very fun.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I find the interface to be awkward and confusing, like a pre-iPhone-era mobile phone. Remember those days? Miss 'em? I'm often going around in circles trying to set up my workout, and I end up just using the simplest workouts. You know what I'd rather do? Start running or biking when I'm ready to go. Because by the time I'm dressed and out there on the streets in the cold and dark, I'm ready to go, not mess around with a 1990s UI.    It is really easy to synch your watch to your computer. But there is a pretty serious problem with this, for me anyways. You have to synch your watch at the end of every workout, or else the data is mangled. I have lost runs and rides and had others that were more than 24 hours apart treated as single events with long pauses, and this is how they show up in Garmin Training Center. I guess if I wanted to, I could export the data, clean it up, and re-import it. But I feel like any work on my part like this defeats the purpose of having such a device.  I'm getting a fitbit.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it has over 116 games and u can play them all because u will be addicts
B0063GORYU|4.0|Very additive.  Wish it showed the results of the number of times you win. Haven't tried all the levels yet because I been having so much fun playing the one card suit game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is most definitely one of the best bible apps out there. I love the ability to download and the many many translations. The audio features and plans are awesome!
B004UNX1LS|4.0|I have and kindle fire and it works for my device, it is a little slow though. but it could have just been my Internet connection. overall I do like this app.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|HB is neatly laid out and complements the Kindle well. I especially like the ease of looking up verses and applaud making it available for free. I would like to be able to use it offline though. large church buildings don't always have wi-fi that is strong enough. I haven't signed up with the community activities, preferring not to get bogged down in conversations not relevant to my own studies. that aversion seesms to block me from some of the other festoon of the program. but I'm still learning. excellent app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Fantastic app! I love the bookmarks, because I can use my kindle at church without losing the place of my personal reading! It looks great too!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I like this game. its good when just hanging with nutting to do. the higher lvls get chaotic and u really have to plan yer shots. good game for freebie.
B0068FYZ3Y|5.0|This is a revision of an old review.  Had problems getting the dc code to work. It looks like the issue's been resolved.  It's a great movie and getting the bd, DVD and digital copy for this price is a great deal.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|fun! played for over an hour after I downloaded it! definitely worth the price. I'm looking forward to the next edition.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is pretty sweet! it rocks socks, I play a lot of games and this is perfect for me.  it has to have SOMETHING for everybody because there are just so many games! This app is Awesome Baby!
B005HSL626|5.0|it is so fun and addicting you have 2 try 2 slice all the fruit but not the bombs. there are 3 different. games there is zen mode ,classic mode,and arcade mode my favorite mode is zen mode because there r no bombs just a ton of fruit.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I loved this game! I didn't play it for a while because I thought the name sounded kind of dumb, but once I started I could hardly put it down. I have beaten it twice now. I hope there's a sequel!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I don't like games where you are encouraged to download other games to better your circumstances.  other than that its fun
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Quick fun game, may be as much fun as the original!<br />Smooth response, well animated,  runs great on kindle fire.<br />The point reward system is a good addition to the game. Being able to repair your buildings is a good addition.<br />The level ramp up is good too.<br />Gets a bit frantic there too!<br />Great choice for app of the day!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good games I like it u should try to play this game. 117 games not 101. some are hard some are very easy. Ps curling gets a lot of points
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its the best game I have gotten yet on my kindle it is awsome so awesome I'm going to play it most of the day
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very good games . I can see myself spending a lot of time tryiny to beat ever game and kill some time.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Pretty simple but fun upgrade system, and gets increasingly difficult with rebuilds getting more expensive. Plus you need to rebuild to upgrade so it creates an interesting balance. Fun game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Dang this game is fun. I get stuck on it, like, all the time. Yeah well I'm too lazy to write a review so... PEACE OUTT
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are actually. surprisingly fun and this game is a great way to pass a short amount of time quickly and the thing said I needed more words in this review so there
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I liked this game. It moves fast and makes you work to win the game. Save those buildings, they increase your score a lot. As the game progresses you get to buy upgrades with the points you earn. Buy more missiles, increase the blast area, increase the blast time and even increase the missile speed. You will need to keep updating your defensive capability all the time.<br /><br />The incoming missiles come faster and faster and split into multiple war heads sometimes. You really have to time your shot well to lead the incoming missile. Too close and you miss it and too far ahead and the blast is gone before the missile gets there.<br /><br />I enjoyed the game a lot and the touch screen aiming is really good. This game has much better aiming control than the original Missile Command. I played it on the Kindle Fire and the screen is the right size for this game. It is like playing an old arcade game that has been updated to the newer technology of today. I just wish my fingers were faster to protect those buildings better! Thanks Amazon for a nice game!
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|It's a good movie!  I plan to keep it as part of my collection.  Great movie for couples to watch together over n over...
B004LWZW42|5.0|This movie is an excellent example of how a saga of movies can get better with a new release. This movie explains the origins of many of the X-Men characters and the interrelationships they have. It is fast paced and the story is well written. The special effects are outstanding and help to show the magnitude of the powers of the X-Men.<br /><br />This is the fifth movie in this series and is one of, if not the best of them all. It explains the first group of X-Men and how they came together and then later formed into two groups of the good versus the evil. The plot is based around the intervention of the government to find and harness the powers of the mutants and of an evil mutant genius who yearns for global control under his leadership.<br /><br />If you are a loyal X-Men freak like I am you will enjoy this movie. It is a good script and the cast does a great job playing the roles of the mutants. Action and adventure with a lot of good effects make this edition a winner!<br /><br />Gather your family around the TV and enjoy it together.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some games are fun, not finish whole thing yet. good time waster, but still just time waster, don't want to say much.
B0041KKYGU|3.0|Cameron Diaz plays a school teacher (Elizabeth) who is bummed out because she lost her possible ticket to the riches when her rich boyfriend dumps her. She thinks that if she gets a boob job she will be able to capture Mr. Right (anybody who is rich) and quit her day job as a teacher.<br /><br />At school she is obnoxious, rude, and really the total illustration of what you do not want in a teacher. She is trying to hook up with a rich substitute teacher, (Justin Timberlake) whose role is a total geek. What follows is a movie that is part comedy and uses Cameron's beauty to try to make an average movie into a good movie.<br /><br />While there are some laughs the movie just is so blatantly sexual that it just doesn't work well. Cameron's character is so shallow and such a gold digger that you really can't like her and Justin's acting is like a 2 hour Saturday Night Live skit. Cameron's role comes across as cheap and trashy and because of this it detracts from the story.<br /><br />Some comedy but it could have been better with a stronger comedic script and if Cameron's character had a real life and higher aspirations to excel.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|fun free game I enjoyed missile command for the atari this brings back memories<br /> a must have for atari fans
0439023513|2.0|The first and second book was so amazing it was difficult to out down. I ran out to get this book in anticipation to a superb ending... was extremely disappointed. I did not even finish this book as it is hard to get through. It took me a day each to read the first and second book... it has taken me a week to get halfway through Mockingjay and decided I just cannot finish it. I am very let down.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|You cant beat free and there are so many games to choose from.  It is also fun to see if you can unlock everything.
0439023513|2.0|I was extremely excited to read the final book in this trilogy. Sadly, it was a disappointment in nearly every way. The first 2/3 of the novel drags on excessively. Also, nothing takes place \\"on camera\\" but is only described by the characters second-hand narrative, which is very anticlimactic, to say the least.   There seem to be no likable characters in this novel, which is necessary for the audience to \\"root for\\" someone. Katniss seems to be detached, and lacks the likability and passion she had in the first two novels. She does also seem to be injured and in the hospital repeatedly when major events occur, as if the author could not find a way to weave her into the narrative. I was waiting for her to realize the power within her and assume her full and rightful position as leader of the rebels. She never really does.   The supporting cast of characters is poorly written as well. Haymitch is a bore. Peeta is almost evil. Gale seems trivial to the storyline, again as if the author was unsure of what to do with him. It is a sad display of disintegration of characters that we loved so well in the first two novels, and it becomes hard to root for anyone at all.  The author seems unable to make anyone or anything good or positive. Even President Snow is even given a slight break at the end, revealing a \\"truth\\" to Katniss. The rebels are written as somewhat evil as well, with very few likeable characters, which is something the audience always needs in a story. We need a \\"good guy\\" (or woman, in this case) to hope and fight for. Those characters make us want to turn the page and stay up until 1am to read a book.  I have no idea if all three books will be made into a book, but I cannot see how this novel will translate into a film that people will want to watch. I know that every book does not need a happy ending, but this would make someone leave the movie theater feeling despondent.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|takes up a great deal of time. great for procrastination. great to keep kids busy for an hour or so.
0375842209|5.0|As an avid reader, this book will go down as one of the best I have read.  It is absolutely beautifully written, sad and absolutely memorable.  I could not put it down and recommend it to all who love to read.
1250006341|5.0|I'm really impressed by this book and so glad I took a chance and bought it. It has so many beautiful pictures as well as information about filming and production, the characters (some backstory) and the customs of the times. There are also a few short quotes from the actors commenting on their characters. I particularly enjoyed the part about the costumes.  For example, some dresses were vintage, some were rented or borrowed and others were made just for this production from new fabric or a combination of new and vintage. The clothing chosen for each actor is very important as it helps tell the story of the character's place in society.<br />Sometimes when I've bought a book like this about a movie, I've felt cheated because there was no substance and that is definitely not the case here. I know I will want to look at this book and reread it many times. I'm recommending it to all my friends who love Downton Abbey.

0060873027|1.0|I'm a long-time fan of Michael Crichton so naturally I was devastated by his death and yet thrilled to learn that two manuscripts, one complete and one incomplete, were discovered on his computer. The first was Pirate Latitudes, a fun but not a particularly deep pirate adventure that was more of a historical adventure akin to Crichton's earlier works such as The Great Train Robbery and Eaters of the Dead than his techno-thrillers of recent times. The second was Micro which was only a third complete. Crichton's widow and his editor selected Richard Preston, an author who was known to write novels about infectious disease epidemics and bioterrorism, to complete the book.<br /><br />I went into the book apprehensive because I was unfamiliar with Preston's work and I wasn't sure if I would be able to tell Crichton's work and from Preston's. Unfortunately, it became far too easy to tell. The book plays out like Jurassic Park meets Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, and even though this premise was more ludicrous than Crichton's normal fare, and I could tell where the book was playing with his ideas.<br /><br />Preston's side of the book stuck out painfully: Rarely have I read such horrible prose and poorly written dialogue in a published work. The prose constantly broke the simple writing rule of \\"show, don't tell\\" that it became hard for me not to throw the book across the room. The dialogue felt unnatural and clumsy, while the narration often repeated itself within several pages or even with single paragraphs.<br /><br />With all this in mind, it's no surprise that the characters themselves had nothing going for them. Almost all of them were cyphers and merely played out roles for the needs of the story instead acting out their own motivations. Everything each character did was predictable and boring and the only shocking moment of the whole story was when the lead character was abruptly killed.<br /><br />If this book was so bad, why did I keep reading? I've read every single Crichton fiction novel (with the exception of State of Fear) so I suppose kept with it out of some sense of loyalty. I wanted so badly to enjoy this book. Granted Crichton's work declined somewhat in recent years (his last great novel, in my opinion, was Timeline) but I always at least enjoyed reading his books. Micro had some interesting ideas but Preston did an absolutely appalling job in presenting them and and even worse job maintaining the spirit of Crichton's work.on of State of Fear) so I suppose kept with it out of some sense of loyalty.

0062112430|2.0|Although the premise for the book is intriguing, the author did not follow through. For the presumed audience which it is often advertised to (YA fans of dystopian fiction such as Divergent, The Hunger Games...) the plot simply was not complicated enough. It verged on an insult to YA readers. Pieces of the book drew me in as a reader, but as a whole, the book was predictable and seemed not to have many plot twists.  I am hoping for better recommendations from advertisers in the future...I suggest that you skip this read, unless you've already read everything else in the genre.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app its so much fun to play all the games and get points to buy new games I cant think of anything wrong with this app
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is super cool retro style game! Good gameplay and cool graphics/colors! So yeah its cool an stuff. Androis ftw!

B005K17RU0|5.0|works nicely on the kindle fire :) seems pretty accurate ss well.  I like how it is a floating sun in my carousel.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Android app works fine, just as on my phone, and easier to use on kindle fire because of screen.  Free version well worth the money!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|awesome game. works amazing on the kindle. my kids and I love it. now I am just wasting space typing random words.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i like this app alot i reccomend it i need more points alot of points that is the fun part
B0060AY6FO|3.0|Pretty good. Like her mystery books far better. quick read. Follows Austin's style well enough, but it just did not seem to really fit.
B003L77GG0|3.0|It shipped fast but product was cheap looking. The box never closed properly. Probably won't buy from this place again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great app but some of the games can be confusing. I also sometimes have trouble with some of the first few games, like the spaceship one.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game for some quick arcade style action. Very easy to get started but has enough challenge to keep you playing.

B004FQX59I|5.0|I got the movie on time.It was packaged carefully and arrived safely. It was a gift for someone who had it on her Christmas list.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy were the gift I choose for myself as birthday present.And the first movie is coming this year! I can't wait!!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Perfect for Kindle Fire as it takes full advantage of the touch control. 4 stars because, yes, it does get a bit repetitive, but isn't that the nature of missile command anyway?
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game, a bit on the easy side at first.  Made it to Night 25 on my first try.  Runs great on my Kindle Fire.  Definitely worth a download.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a great remake of the classic missile command game for the Andriod. The graphics are a bit goofy, but the game play is great. Brings back memories of the old game with a couple of new twists. Works great on my Fire. Nice FAOTD, thanks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|its easy to start a new game and I like how if you double tap it will move it for you,on its own.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|it is a great game to play as it requires a minimal time investment, yet can keep you interested.  It is easy to learn and exciting to play
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Even on a phone it's fun. Can't wait to play on my tablet.  The possibility of upgrades makes it much better.
0439023521|5.0|I got this book series as a gift.  I wasn't sure what I was in for.  I completed this first book in less than a day!  From page 1, I was hooked.  It's got all of the characteristics I look for in a good book; Realistic characters, an interesting setting, and lots of action and suspense...without too much visual gore.  I recommend it to everyone I know.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|This game is great at challenging the mind and training your eyes. A good game to waste the day on.

B00005LOUP|3.0|I purchased this particular DVD for my blind brother.  The decision to purchase it was based on the indication that it not only included a Descriptive Video Track (DVS), but it also had a talking menu setup so a blind individual would not need a sighted person to set it up to play in DVS.  The talking setup worked once and we were unable to make it work again after multiple tries on different TV and DVD players.  This was disappointing.    Aside from that, the visual rendition, sound and widescreen format are perfect and for a sighted person the DVD is fine.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|sooooo much funn!!!!! I love it and it doesn't get plod but sometimes you cannot understand the directions. but I would get it.
B00634GHJA|5.0|this app is awesome!!! it was so easy to move my photos from my computer to my kindle fire. the galary has some neat features also, I must have.put over 200 pica on my fire in less than five minutes, the only thing I wish it would do is make it possible to make your photos az wallpaper and be able to make folders, other than that its easy :)
B004529NLG|2.0|Packaging is good...at least using the envelop. However, the item has a broken case. I always received broken/damaged package of the unit.... so disappointed...  For the movie, a 3-7seconds part has a blurred / distorted images (Moose and his GF were dancing in the street)...
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to use, one tap will move cards to correct place. solitaire is always a fun time. the ads are unobtrusive.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Best missle defense ever.  This is a true sequel to the classic and the upgrades make it fun and give it more strategy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are very addictive and fun. Some games are harder then others. Both my nephews enjoy playing the games and trying to see who gets the higher score.
0525478817|5.0|I've read every one of John's books, follow him on Facebook and watch the Vlogbrothers videos.  So I'm sure my stalker-like admiration colors my opinion, but I think this is his best book yet!  The characters are funny, smart, surprising, and very real!  Looking for a book that will wring every emotion from you?  I laughed, cried, and even yelled a couple of times.  On the surface it's a story about teens with cancer, but underneath it's really the story of two (three if you count Isaac) teenagers dealing with life in all its glory and pain -- falling in love, playing video games, fighting with parents, and dealing with the side effects of cancer.  Yes, it's inevitable that you will be brought to tears, but John's story is not manipulative or cloyingly sweet -- this is not a Hallmark movie, but everything we've come to expect from this author.  You won't be disappointed.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I am using this app on a Velocity Micro Cruz Tablet PC running 2.2.1 ---- I checked out several note programs and they all failed in one way or another. Then I came across this app. I was delighted as it done just what I wanted an app of this type to do. Simple, and I love the color notes which is part of the software. Try it and you will love it. Great replacement for the one that usually comes with Android tablets.

B000002UTY|1.0|After reading rash67's review I popped in my Best of/Sons of Mercury 1986-1975,AAD, by Bill Inglot to compare songs and now I'm thinking of tossing this new cd in the trash. Mona on this one is loud bass and fader guitar that's kind of disappointing to listen to. The background guitar is way back there almost gone. I'm going to try the import version like he suggests. This one was pain-full to listen to. SO I JUST RECEIVED THE REPERTOIRE ONE for $5.00 more and am now keeping the Capitol records recording and tossing this one in the trash. This one is even louder and jarring to listen to and makes the Capitol Records one sound good by comparison.
0062060554|3.0|Before I Go to Sleep starts with a lot of promise, but disappoints. The book should have been about 150 pages shorter and it would have been much more compelling. The character writes vivid descriptions of people, events and conversations in her journal every day. I found it implausible that someone would remember that much of what someone said earlier in the day, much less a fleeting memory. It began to annoy me that she would write word for word a long conversation, rather than just summarize what was said, as I think someone would want to do to ensure the accuracy of what they write if you were trying to remind yourself of who you are each day. The story is good enough, I just wish something had happened in the plot much sooner.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I put this on my Kindle Fire. graphics are good. it's easy to manuver. I would recommend to my friends.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game is well done. The gameplay is addicting and the money system adds a new element. It's not that challenging, however.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is really fun and difficult at times but its really really enjoyable! ! get this game its awesome
0977326403|5.0|This is a Must Read for all public sector leaders.  As a Human Resources Manager for State and Federal employee's, I found this very helpful when advising senior management.  Use it in conjunction with \\"Good to Great\\".
1400032717|5.0|I thought this book might be a bit cheesy but went for it anyways. It was great! An easy one day read for those of you who can't put a book down and let me tell you, this is one of them!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very easy to play with a touch screen. If you ever liked playing missile command, you will enjoy this game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app.  wish it would say it was snowing more often but maybe that feature will be in their next app
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very fun awesome good graphics lots of fun passes the time quicky cant believe I played it for the whole day!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is great I can never put my kindle down and fire me theirs. I don't know people r talking about that the ads are annoying. but for me theirs no ads at all.
B005XN31LY|5.0|its very artistically done and great actors and just good all around to me if u grew up loving the happily ever after stories and the princess theme from disney then this is for you they took it and weaved them all together it was so awesome and sweet
B0054JZC6E|2.0|the games seem pretty basic.  would not recommend unless u are really bored and have found the end of the web
B0015DYIH2|4.0|Granted there were some flaws in the 4th installment, but all-in-all, I enjoyed it. I have one huge question though....is that it???? The end of the book left us all hanging. Yes,I know the last chapter was the \\"happily ever after\\" chapter, but there is still so much to tell. What happens with the Voluri? What happens with Renesmee and Jacob in the future? Give us some history on some of the other characters. Where they came from, who made them, why were they made, etc. I would love to know Alice and Jasper's story in more detail. What about Rosalee and Emmett? Come on Stephanie...don't leave it like that. There are still so many questions to be answered. I think that was my biggest dissapointment. That this is the last one. When I finished reading this book, I was happily anticipating the next one, and then learned that this was the last. There is so much more I would like to know. Hopefully, Stephanie Meyer will reconsider and add at least one or two more books to the series.
014241543X|4.0|If I Stay is about a girl who has pretty much died. And her spirit hangs around her loved ones and she sees through their eyes the pain they are going through watching her fight for her life after a devastating car accident that claimed her father, mothers and younger brother lives. This story was hard to get through. It made me cry. I didn't think I would get through. But I did. Brace yourself before reading this. Because it is a tear jerker.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I chose a Bible reading plan that will take me through the Bible in one year. It is really keeping me on track! I love taking my Kindle Bible to church! So easy to use and light weight compared to traditional Bible. Highlight a verse with just a tap of your finger.

B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is fun &amp; very easy to play. better than havinging to play lon line. free makes it even better!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have not had any of the problems I have read about. My computer times out to the log in screen requiring a password to activate that account. I love that. It allowed me to set my phone to adjust to my computer's native display setting. I love that. It takes a moment to get comfortable with the controls. That so far was the worst part of this app. After a couple of honest uses you will have even that down. It transfers all sound to your device thus muting the computer accessed. Computer's original volume is returned upon disconnect. I use this mostly at home and have not been able to download a file from the accessed computer, which I think would make it even better. Nonetheless, this is a great app. One laptop is XP and the other is 7. Phone is a Bionic.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|great game but shuts itself off after a couple of games, right n the middle of a game!!!! and sometimes goes to a black screen .... would love to get full version ...please fix soon.....
1451648537|5.0|First and foremost, what makes this biography of [[ASIN:1451648537 Steve Jobs]] so fascinating is the richness and complexity of his life. Also notable is the way in which Walter Isaacson was able to capture and present his story to us. It was obviously a delicate balance for the author to maintain, given the uniqueness of the individual. What gives this biography its final perk is how we, as readers, can instantly relate today to Steve's innovations in so many different ways. Not only does that makes this book a compelling read, it also brings into focus how this one man and his vision influenced and affected everyone on a global scale, even those who don't yet realize it.<br /><br />While I have admittedly been an Apple fan for a long time, I was not quick to pick up this biography because I was first interested in seeing how those who might not have followed his life as closely as I would remember Steve and would react to his passing. I had no doubt that there would be some polarization; Steve dealt with that his entire life. What I typically found was the obvious trivia hyped in the news and the magazines, along with the speculation and things that we were already aware of, including the typical out-of-context sound bites. This book was never intended to be the unexpurgated history of Steve Jobs. Additional confusion was added into the media noise when people failed to differentiate between who this man was and what he had accomplished. However, with his unprecedented access to Mr. Jobs and with the full support of Jobs and that of his 'extended' family, Isaacson was able to create a rich portrait of this very special individual, who wanted his children to understand what he did and know why he wasn't always there for them.<br /><br />Isaacson's masterpiece lays out Jobs's successes... and failures, his talents... and flaws, his work and his family, his passions and loves, his values and his quirks, fleshing out how this amazing man, who gave everything, still demanded perfection in return. You will find yourself cheering for Jobs and his followers as the book's 600 pages fly by. I found it quite balanced and comfortable to read. The work at Apple was never dull, the products were always exciting and the successes were 'insanely great.' While I already felt privileged to have been a part of this era, Isaacson's words helped me to appreciate the scope of Steve's life and his role in the many successes of Apple even more. His impact on how the world now connects and communicates is global by definition but it reaches down to the personal levels with the interfaces and the devices that Jobs conceived of and created.<br /><br />I am not an original Apple user, just an older one. I bought my first Mac when I was 50 and bought my Mom her first one when she was 81. I easily related to Steve, who was 15 years my junior, as a clever, younger brother who'd made it possible for me and the rest of 'our family' to experience a better world. His loss was profound for everyone because of his abilities and his true passion to do more. Thankfully, one of his accomplishments was to successfully infuse his DNA into Apple, now one of the world's most powerful corporations, to carry on his innovating and to improve on the human condition through communication, education and technology. The world would definitely welcome more of that kind of leadership and I know that you will agree once you have reflected upon the story of Steve's life. We are fortunate that Walter Isaacson has done a wonderful job of sharing that story with us.<br /><br />Bob Magnant is a novelist who writes about technology, globalization and Internet security, and US policy in the Middle East.in return.

B004WGGQPQ|4.0|My three year old loves this app. He has a blast and will continue to be able to create for years as his skills improve. It is designed to be used by a User with some skill and has the features to keep a teenager busy yet my son still has a good time of it and can navigate through the tools with little to no help at all.<br />Best one I've seen yet.
0060873027|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It caught my attention from the start.  I couldn't put the book down.  I ended up reading it every night, after putting the kids to sleep, etc., and finished it in 5 days.  However, there was a corny part near the end (4/5 of the way).  I don't think it helped (the story) to have an old man appear, who had been living in the micro underworld, to help out the kids.  Rather Hollywood-ish.  Overall, highly recommended.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Easy to use app. I love that it can synch to my email account to allow update on any of my devices with the app.<br />So I can put a reminder in on my phone or ipod and it will be there on my kindle later. I can put a list together when I'm reading before bed and it will be on my phone in the morning when I am out and about thinking, \\"What was it I was thinking about before bed...?\\"<br />Love it.
B002BWP49M|1.0|After suffer all the twilight movies (so far) for my wife (she insist on go the movies and watch this..things..) i can say, with all honesty, this saga is one of the worst craps i see on film.   There are only two ways to watch this, one is laughing loud of how awful this is, the other is seeing thru the eyes of a thirteen years old girl.   I dont see how this movies making money, i just depressing. Now, if you want a few laughs about a bad movie, super creppy (sort of handsome) young actors, really misoginist script and you really really hate womens, this is your movie. Dosnt hurt if you really hate vampires too, because this movie really take all a vampire should be and turn them into the gayiest people on earth, really any creature of the night must be ashame of been in any way related to this travesty. Anyway, a movie is as good as is screenplay, and in this case, the lack of it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Ahhh, the memories!  Except this time I have all the quarters I used to shove into this game at the arcade.  Lots of addictive fun!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very good game, great graphics. I can see it eating up a lot of time if I'm bored. I'd easily pay a couple bucks for it.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Bought this for my mom's new kindle fire, she lovesit! It also helps that London was near the top of the cover, she grew up there. Some people said the cover doesn't fit, but it was just tight, which is what you want.

B005HSL626|4.0|Fruit Ninja is a blast to play, although it can get a little old after a while.  This is one of those games I like to keep on my Kindle for just for a little relaxation play.  I love the Zen mode, because you can play with a short time and no bombs (i.e. you can't die).  Beautiful colors on the Fire!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it works really well it is super fun and perfect for kids=):) it has no blood or groosom parts I love it
B006C1DH92|4.0|I got this for free when it was the App of the Day.  I like the original Fruit Ninja, and the biggest difference with this game is there is a mode you can play several different mini games following the same principle: slice the fruit.  It is fun because the mini games are different just about every time.  It has excellent replay-ability.
B00004YTU6|5.0|Many people saw Warning as the downfall of Green Day's career; a plunge into the sell out pop scene if you will. But, here's the kicker, Green Day made this album so they WOULDN'T sell out to the ever decaying screamo-punk scene that has now been associated with angry teens who bitch without reason. Warning is a nice, crunchy and ray but fun, and meaningful album that takes many different ideas and themes, and gives them a punk edge without throwing it overboard. Those who stomp their feet and throw a temper tantrum because \\"BAWWW IT'S NOT 90's BOOGER AND DICK JOKES GREEN DAY WAAAAAA\\"need to grow up and learn that when you've been a band for 10 years at this point, things change. I've never seen a band in my life stay the same and do the same thing for their entire run and still be seen as successful and original, save for Nickelback (and you can see that they're obviously not a favorite amongst music lovers.) This was Green Day NOT selling out, but branching out. Trying different things is not a bad thing, and screaming and yelling about it makes you look like an idiot.   That being said, Warning is a fantastic album that can hold it's own in a see of angsty punk bands and dwindling 90's rock. If you want something fun, and yet has good meaning and value, Warning is a great bet.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have been struggling to put into words what can be said about this final book in Collins' trilogy.  It was a hard book to read from beginning to end.  It was certainly as much a page turner as much as the first two were, that was not the reason it was hard to read.  Rather there seemed to be a horrible emotional trap for Katniss (and the reader) around every literal and figurative corner.  But it was well thought out and the message was received painfully well.  It makes me question the excess in my world, the reality of war, the potential fragility of the republic, and the very scary possibilities for the human race.  I give it 5 stars because sometimes the greatness of a book is inversely proportional to how comfortable we feel with the questions it raises.

0143119680|4.0|I read a few of the reviews, and I have to say that they are ALL right in their way.  It is a silly story. Like, geesh,  another vampire? Really?  And 1500 yrs. old? Isn't she a little young for him and I would definitely have some issues, like starting to think all vampires are pedophiles, relatively speaking, if it weren't just all made up nonsense.  But then, you forget how old he is, vampires apparently just get older and NOT wiser, and so the veil of believability drops conveniently down and the young witch makes the most sense of the whole lot of them. (out of the mouths of babes...)  The story is best when there is alot of action going on and its like a history/adventure, detective/science story because when they just hang out and sort out their relationship the vampire just seems too squeamish about certain things.  Imagine that!  I know, its hard!  So I didn't like those parts as well.  But in the end, this is how I knew it was a good story:  I kept thinking about it.

1932100660|5.0|Due to recent publicity from Bill Clinton's post-surgery dietary changes, and the recent release of the film, [[ASIN:B0053ZHZI2 Forks Over Knives]], this 2006 book is benefitting from a resurgence of attention. After reading this book, I could only think- I wish I had found this book sooner.<br /><br />I have read a lot of books on food, diet, and nutrition- and almost always they have left me disappointed. I find nutrition books are either focused only on one food type or nutrient, or push some gimmicky diet (a la the Atkins Diet), or are too esoteric and free from any grounding in sound science, or are mind-numbingly boring and poorly written.<br /><br />This book from Dr. Colin Campbell is none of those things. \\"The China Study\\" takes a macro, bird's eye view of what we eat. For example, Campbell writes, \\"As you shall see, considering how networks of chemicals behave instead of isolated single chemicals is far more meaningful.\\" This book is an attempt to look at the whole picture. As Campbell writes, \\"This is the story of how food can change our lives.\\" Indeed it is.<br /><br />Dr. Campbell, in this book, espouses a whole food, plant-based diet. He very intentionally does not refer to the diet he encourages as \\"vegan\\", due to the politically charged nature of that word, and because he is not strictly-speaking a vegan. This book is entirely apolitical. Its author makes it clear that his motivation for his dietary behaviors is purely health, not to protect animals or be a steward of the environment (although the latter he does mention as a bonus implication of his choices).<br /><br />Dr. Campbell begins his book, in the chapter \\"House of Proteins\\" laying out a convincing argument of why animal-based proteins (particularly casein, the protein found in cow's milk) are harmful to the body. To support his thesis, Dr. Campbell falls back on his life of research (most notable of which is \\"The China Study\\", which Chou EnLai, the Premier of China in the early 1970s funded when he was dying of cancer. It is the largest and most comprehensive demographic study ever conducted that looks at what people eat and their levels of general health. Dr. Campbell was one of the team of researchers appointed to conduct this study.)<br /><br />Dr. Campbell never stretches the findings of his studies too far, and is quick to make clear that the correlations found in his studies does not necessarily mean causation- that is, just because populations that consume more animal fats and animal-based proteins have high incidences of \\"diseases of affluence\\" (cancer, heart disease, stroke) does not mean that these proteins cause such diseases. But the combination of the correlations, with the clear and powerful way that Dr. Campbell outlines his observations of how animal-based proteins can disrupt some of the body's most essential organic processes, allows one to comfortably make a strong probabilistic guess that these type of foods are best eliminated from one's diet.<br /><br />After Dr. Campbell outlines the various diseases, their possible relationships with animal-based proteins, he arrives at suggestions in the chapters \\"Eating Right: Eight Principles of Food and Health\\" and \\"How to Eat.\\"<br /><br />From there Dr. Campbell answers the question that surely so many readers will have through the first half of the book, which is, \\"If you're right, Dr. Campbell, why am I just hearing about this stuff now?\\" In the chapter \\"Science: the Dark Side\\", Dr. Campbell outlines how the food industry (of which his parents, ironically, were a part- they were dairy farmers) and government agencies (some of which he used to sit on- and with which he has firsthand experience interacting) are compromised, and are not sources of sound nutritional advice. Dr. Campbell outlines the way in which powerful corporations with clear monetary interests fund these boards. It is a blatant conflict of interest that has profound implications on how and what our country eats.<br /><br/>The other convincing case that Dr. Campbell makes for why you do not hear his argument in the mainstream dialogue is the fact that hospital networks, who can derive up to 65% of their income from heart-related surgeries and medicines, and who employ surgeons who are faced with mountains of debt from years of study and who stand to make gobs of money from conducting surgeries, are not ready or willing to adopt preventive approaches to heart disease.<br /><br />Dr. Campbell cites the case of surgeon Dr. Esselstyn, who proposed to the Cleveland Clinic a preventive \\"arrest and reversal\\" nutrition program for heart disease patients as a first step before surgery. The hospital said they had no interest in such a program according to Dr. Campbell; and yet, some of the trustees and surgeons of the very same hospital would send their own wives and children to Dr. Esselstyn for his nutritional advice.

Regardless of how much of this book you agree with, there will be at least morsels of sound science, delivered in a distilled, comprehensible style that you will be able to absorb, implement in your life, and benefit from.ear his argument in the mainstream dialogue is the fact that hospital networks, who can derive up to 65% of their income from heart-related surgeries and medicines, and who employ surgeons who are faced with mountains of debt from years of study and who stand to make gobs of money from conducting surgeries, are not ready or willing to adopt preventive approaches to heart disease.   Dr. Campbell cites the case of surgeon Dr. Esselstyn, who proposed to the Cleveland Clinic a preventive \\"arrest and reversal\\" nutrition program for heart disease patients as a first step before surgery. The hospital said they had no interest in such a program according to Dr. Campbell; and yet, some of the trustees and surgeons of the very same hospital would send their own wives and children to Dr. Esselstyn for his nutritional advice.

B0018QOIXU|5.0|Thanks to so many other positive reviews that I read, I decided to try this cd. Never heard of this artist before.  Every review shown on this Amazon page 'nails it'. Extraordinary voice. Great sound, great songs.
B002WY65VU|5.0|My purchase arrived in time for Christmas!  This was the #1 request on my daughters christmas list.  My daughter LOVED it!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good of an app, frustrating when you can't pass certain levels /games though. but that depends on the person.  overall,.it's a pretty good game
B004XJHBCE|5.0|It reduces clutter and helps organize. The only downside is you can't move it to the sd card. I wish it would auto categorize installed apps.
B001QWBM62|5.0|Bought this recorder for my son, a film editor for Christmas. The sound quality, play back and features are amazing.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Awesome game, would not have been disappointed even if I had paid for it!  No issues on HTC Inspire after hours of play
B004FUZLYG|5.0|Though he can play more romantic and contemporary works with passion and grace, I don't think there's a pianist today who can interpret baroque piano as well as Tharaud. And I say this for his concert performances (I have seen him live) and his recordings.  I thought his Bach Concertos Italiens on Harmonia Mundi, along with his other HM recordings of Rameau and Couperin were the ultimate, and they are amazing, but this Scarlatti album is incredible.  His playing is technically brilliant, but at the same time has so much emotion and beauty to it.  This is simply a gorgeous record.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is almost as ingenious as angry birds. I would recommend this game to you if you like action packed strategy games.
B002ONC9NC|2.0|Mediocre, predictable, young girl seduced by older man who turns out to be married.  But I have to hand it to Peter Saarsgard. A great performance, a long way from Boys Don't Cry. I didn't realize he was that good an actor.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I travel a lot so this is a great way to kill time when I don't feel like reading!  I recommend.
B004I9CXHW|1.0|Fit the MDI port in my 2011 VW GTI just fine.  The car came with an iPod/iPhone cable, but I wanted to use a flash drive.  Worked fine and enumerated the USB flash drive I plugged in, then mysteriously stopped working after about a month.  I was going to order an OEM cable to replace this, then one day I plugged in a flash drive and it worked again for a day or two, then stopped.  Would like to return it but there is no warranty and the return windows was only a month.  Should have just bought the cable from the dealer but didn't want to drive all that way.  Lesson learned.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this application! it is easy to use and has every option imaginable to help meet my needs and make it easier for me to understand GODS beautiful word:)
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app! every once in a while it glitches a little, but seems to fix itself, so nbd. I use this app daily! very well done.
B005K17RU0|4.0|this is a wonderful app that is accurate and reliable, I use it before I go to bed in preparation for the following day or during business trips.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|the first major bug I noticed with this that after my first game the upgrades didn't reset. then the upgrades after the round started at 1 so if I did upgrade it went from upgrade 5 to 1. also one of the upgrades at level 1 wouldn't allow me to purchase it so it was stuck at level 1. I don't know if level 5 is the max but it wouldn't allow me to purchase anything after that.  besides this odd behavior the game is awesome. I just wish I could keep upgrading past level 5.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great app that I would recommend, especially for free. The game works great on my Verizon galaxy nexus. Five stars.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I purchased this bluray as another Christmas present and it arrived very quickly and in excellent condition! Would buy again from seller.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I love this show! It looks great on blu ray, too! It's a shame this great show was canceled so early on.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|I purchased this bluray as another Christmas present and it arrived very quickly and in excellent condition! Would buy again from seller.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is entertaining. fun fun fun for the whole fam damly. go buy it or else you wont have fun.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I looked at several cases for my new Kindle Fire, and I'm so glad I chose this one. It fits perfectly and protects the device without adding weight or bulk. And it's pink :-)
B001DUJNGS|1.0|2008 brings latest to date Enigma release \\"Seven Lives Many Faces\\". It's a pity to say but album sounds like music created on Atari/Amiga in late 80s, production is very, very poor, songs are so simple and pathetic that it's hard to believe that is album created by the same producer who 15 years earlier released \\"The Cross of Changes\\" (in my opinion ultimate Enigma creation with superb connection of rock and chill out themes). There is one quite good song with very nice lyrics \\"Je t`aime' 'till My Dying Day\\" but horrible production and arrangement with repeated question \\"Do you, do you, do you, do you?\\" makes this song unlistenable (like rest of this release).
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Wow, I haven't played Missile Command since the days of Atari and this just brought back all of those memories.  A lot of fun.
B000GRUS22|1.0|2006 \\"A posteriori\\" - oh dear. That was huge disappointment. That supposed to be a concept album that describes a journey through the Galaxy. The problem is that album is monotonic and boring, production so poor and all songs sound very similar to each other. Two singles were released. Terrible \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\" with horrible sampled voice that sounds like murdered cat was released to promote the album. Few months before Enigma released \\"Hello and welcome\\" that was promoting \\"LSD\\" compilation but is included on \\"A posteriori\\" as well. Single version of that song is rather typical pop-rock song but on the EP there is very good remix \\"After The Storm Mix\\" and album contains a bit modified version of this mix. Another quite good standalone track is \\"Sitting On The Moon\\" with interesting nostalgic lyrics but very simple and basic arrangament.
B004LWZW42|1.0|What a load of brainless, ridiculous rubbish,very cliched,i couldn't wait for it to end.......that's 2 hours of my life wasted
B00003XB8K|3.0|2000 \\"The Screen Behind The Mirror\\" - that is a quite decent pop album. Still good production and quality of the songs above average from that period. Unfortunately \\"TSBTM\\" is far below standard set up by \\"The Cross Of Changes\\" (in my opinion ultimate Enigma creation with superb connection of rock and chill out themes). Highlights of the album: \\"Gravity of Love\\", \\"Smell of Desire\\", \\"Modern Crusaders\\", \\"Traces\\" and title track. Nice addition was to use voice of Ruth Ann (of band Olive).
B005F96UNM|5.0|A cowboy without guns, a samurai without swords, meeting up at the Horseless Horseman's saloon, what a great premise of a movie.  Set in a near but not futuristic future where weapons are outlawed and the races mix freely in style and culture, this movie follows the path of two men in their quest for vengeance, guided by a third man who knows better, and those whom they confront, a list of killers, each with his own style.  Mixing both live action and animation, the movie mashes up everything in every aspect of the film.  Filming uses multiple styles; sometimes the camera moves, sometimes it stays the same; some scenes are shot from above, some from below, some in perspective.  The storytelling involves flashbacks, parallel story-lines, and occasional diversions as comedy, suspense, drama and great dialogue are mixed together.  Overall, a great film.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|2003 \\"Voyageur\\" - that is very, very average album. You can find many of pop albums with similar quality. Whatever factor was making from Enigma a very special project here is almost completely lost. Songs are quite boring, production not excellent and something is obviously missing. Ruth Ann appears here again in 2 songs. I like only one song really: \\"In The Shadows In The Light\\".
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is a fun variation to solitaire!  I have found another favorite for my Kindle! so much fun in such a small space;)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very good game easy to play and gives you many different variety of games and very challenging good game. I think you should buy this
0802714544|3.0|The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is the first Le Carré novel I've read - coincidentally, just as another adaptation of his Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy hits the theaters.  Like some other reviewers here, I must say that for a book touted as \\"one of the greatest\\" etc., I found the The Spy Who Came in from the Cold to be no clean kill. It has a lot of problems at the basic prose level, and although it was Le Carré's third novel, it reads less like the work of a polished fiction writer than of a government agent who had a fair grasp of narrative. It reminded me strongly of Peter Wright's (non-fictional) Spycatcher, which of course covered the same 1950s-60s Cold War timeframe.  I assume an editor spent quite some time manipulating The Spy Who... into publishable shape. There is little action, of course - the plot is largely spun out in clandestine meetings, tribunals, interrogations, and of course flashbacks - which is not strictly a problem, except that Le Carré's dialogue, on which all this plot depends, is rather clumsy. Characters simply announce how they feel in bold, primary-color emotions. Someone suddenly figures something out, and then it's explained to us in breathless monologues which read like field reports, not human speech.  The love interest, Liz, is a pathetically simple character, moreso (if this is the comparison we are damned to return to) than any Bond girl. The grand English xenophobia is also on display, less overwhelmingly so than in Spycatcher, but still palpable: men with secrets fearful of those they perceive to have filthier secrets - queers, Jews, Arabs. Even though this novel is almost half a century old, its contention is that there is no moral high ground in espionage, so why revel in small-minded prejudice?  The legacy of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold must surely originate from its final pages. The writing here is still workmanlike and yet at its conclusion I felt Le Carré had more to say, in a finer way, than perhaps he was capable of at the time. It's the novel's only emotional note, and well-struck. You'll continue thinking about this book afterwards because of the conclusion (which is just about the best praise I can give, I think) and yet the strength of that conclusion also makes the 250 pages preceding it, their dry exposition and underdeveloped characters, that much feebler.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book had a massive impact on me...  Just how people can change each other's lives in the most unexpected ways.  It outlines the sheer determination and stubborness of the human species and just how different we all are.  This book will have you laugh, will have you cry.  Even til the very end I didn't know what was going to happen - and with me, that doesn't happen often!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|great graphics sounds play and easy to get addicted to! every new level gets a little harder and males it impossible to get bored of! great app!
B0006J28MI|5.0|My son watched this on TV and this is only place that I could find it. It was a great gift for him to unwrap this xmas.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Way too addictive!  I wasted alot of time playing it.  Great job on a simple game that is a whole lot of fun to play.
B0036W5ENM|5.0|This fascinating account of an actual stroke and how the brain works is easy to read and understand. For anyone wishing insight into how the brain works, this book is a must read. For people working with stroke survivors, this book belongs on their shelf for frequent referrals. Excellent material.
B006P4FBUE|3.0|It's neat to have a piano on your kindle, sure, but there are a couple problems. The first is the latency i.e. the time from when you hit the note to when it sounds. It's pretty noticeable, and it makes the beat feature essentially useless because you can't keep in time. The second is the fact that you can't play three notes at a time, only two Max. So overall a fun app, but definitely not for serious or even amateur pianists by any means.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is awesome so you should growth it because I liked it in my lap at home when u play
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|when u start to play this game u cant stop! I been playing this app for hours and I still haven't got tired of it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty fun. if u are the type that don't give up this is for you so give it a try
0780619587|5.0|I had watched this movie \\"Shine\\" at least 3 times prior to purchasing it from Amazon.  It was that interesting.  The TRUE STORY human interest factory staring actory Geoffery Rush in itself is reason enough that one should watch this movie.  The movie is about a child prodogy piano player who is offered scholarships to advance his piano playing ability.  However his father will have no part of his son leaving the family which the father claims must stay together.  The father becomes quite violent with his son in order to keep him from leaving home to purse his dream which changes the sons personality. He further tells his son that if he leaves home, he no longer is part of their family.  The son finally leaves home & Medical attention becomes neccessary, however his talent and love of the piano prevails which results in this facinating story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very entertaining and you get hooked very easily. don't see the problem with the ads or controls. some people just aren't good at some things and shouldn't complain.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|I love this game. The music is soothing when I feel stressed. But the random shutdowns are annoying and they happen usually when I'm close to beating a level. Please fix this bug soon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game and so do my kids!!!!  very easy to play and a lot of different types of games!!!!  would definitely reccomend this app!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Pluses:<br />Very effective, straightforward to use cooler<br />Allowed no-issue overclock of my 2500K to 4GHZ with no issues (there are lots of other components such as memory and motherboard, but the Coolermaster did its job)<br /><br />Negatives:<br />Requires backplate installation. This isn't a big deal if you're building a new machine, but if you're upgrading be aware that you need to have physical access to the bottom of the motherboard<br /><br />Other:<br />The fan disconnects really easily. This sounds obvious, but disconnect the fan from the heat sink while you install the heatsink to make it easier, then clip the fan back on when the heat sink is installed.
0545265355|5.0|My teenage kids read theses books for school, and really loved them. They wanted to read them over and over again, so purchased this set, for them, for Christmas. They loved them, great reading. Thanks
B000024EXY|4.0|Seconds Out has long been one of my favorite live collections -- this remastered set amps up the contributions from Steve Hackett a bit (not as much as I'd hoped; he's still a bit buried in the mix) and showcases Phil Collins stepping out from behind the drum kit to, in his words, \\"Wiggle me bum\\" as lead singer. Good stuff.
0375413405|5.0|Wait, you don't have a copy of Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking already?  Well, you need to remedy that problem right now!  The writing style is cooled just a bit by Simone Beck's influence, but the pragmatic and friendly tone Julia always brought to her writing still comes through.  Like a lot of people, I learned how to cook with Julia on PBS in the 60s - this is the cookbook that started the foodie revolution!  Absolutely can't speak highly enough about this incredible work.
B005FI6IRG|5.0|.... sopranos.  If they choose. Or altos. The chief obstacles being years of training and innate musicianship. Hey, what's to stop you!<br /><br />Philippe Jaroussky trained first as a violinist and then as a pianist, before committing himself to singing at the Early Music Faculty of the Conservatoire de Paris. Max Emanuel Cencic was a singer from the start; from 1987 to 1992, he was a member of the Vienna Boys' Choir, where he was frequently a featured soloist. Recordings of Cencic as a boy soprano are still available, with his performance in Johann Strauss II's \\"Fr&uuml;hlingsstimmen\\" a example of astounding precocious virtuosity. There's the training; you'll be able to hear the innate musicianship on the CD.<br /><br />Jaroussky is the higher and more agile soprano throughout these duets, while Cencic shows some aptitude for sounding like an alto even when singing in a soprano register. Their voices are distinct enough to distinguish their roles in the excerpted recitativos and arias without worrying over the texts. Each singer has a solo cantata with which to display his special timbres. Jaroussky sing the cantata Quanto mai saria pi&ugrave; bello by Francesco Mancini, while Cencic sings Nicola Porpora's Ecco che il primo albore, with two violins playing obbligato. The duet sellection include two \\"duetti da camera\\" by Giovanni Bononcini, a excerpt and a full pastoral cantata by Benedetto Marcello, and a brief duet by Alessandro Scarlatti.  Bononcini is a composer who works impress me more and more, as more and more excellent performances of it are recorded.<br /><br />Duets were the exception raher than the norm in Italian baroque cantatas, serenatas, and operas. Many a major work, in fact, has no more than a single perfunctory lovers' making-up duet.  So these selections are of special interest. The most flamboyant coloratura writing was reserved for the solo arias, to be sung by the superstars, including the acclaimed castrati. Duets provided the composers the chance to display their mastery of counterpoint and of sweeter 'affects'. There are aerial displays to be heard on this CD, from both men, but the most interesting moments, for me, are to be heard in their \\"mixing and matching\\" -- their exquisite ensemble technique and their complementary timbres.<br /><br />And of course, there's Bill Christie with Les Arts Florissants. The CD notes suggest that Christie himself initiated this project of recording Jaroussky and Cencic together.  If so, it's one of a long list of things \\"we\\" need to thank Christie for.terpoint and of sweeter 'affects'.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|ok so you know how you have to shoot pigs well the pigs are to heavy and fat so you can barely get their fat butts out of the way to knock over stuff and hey creator of this game be more creative not that I expect you to have creativity.    ativity but rather than that its a good game keep up the good work sorry for being mean peace out suckers.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Nice &amp; easy to play. Quick and fun - progress moves quick. Good easy to play for young ones. Plenty of ways to get points for new games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is the best game ever you better buy it its so fun really I love it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game I lovedit it never ends and is amazing I love a hundred and onegamres I cant waitfor the next update
B000UR9T8C|2.0|The up side: The action/fights are pretty good. The speical effects got better. The moral is solid. The Sandman(The other villian) is a pretty good villian and has reason for been bad so you can feel sorry for him. The down side: We only got to see Venom FOR ONLY 10 MINUTES. Emo Peter is even geekier then the other one. The crowning down side of this film is Peter's dance scene. It breaks the movie,it changes everything & it sucks out amount of seriousness they were going much like The Spinning the Earth backwards scene from Superman. Overall,Its not great but pretty good and over-the-top silly. Watch it at your own risk. I give this film a 4 out of 10.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I use it to access my files and stuff from anywhere. I have this on my Kindle fire and HTC Inspire. Works excellently and with very little lag.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Easy to use. Automatically handles firewall setup. Finding machine through gmail is very cool. Fast update and very responsive. ...a little tricky to drag and resize windows, but is a minor detail.
1587672707|5.0|Since reading \\"It\\" in '87, it has always been one of my favorites from Stephen King.  I have the first edition as well as the first British edition.  I can't begin to say how blown away I was/am by this limited edition.  The illustrations,  binding,  sleeve,  cover art,  etc are top-notch.  My favorite novel and now my favorite printing!  While it seems expensive for a book,  Amazon Price is $80 less than the publisher's after shipping.  With only appropriately 2500 in print, this as a great price and well worth the cost for collectors(
B006JPS1OM|4.0|graphics are okay but the storyline is why I am drawn in. not many games like this one! not sure if it is worth the $5 price tag.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Challenging and fun,  Missiles get super fast,  plays great on the Fire!  Great game to play while listening to music.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a fun game. Seems easy at first but gets challenging! Good way to kill some time and have fun.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game works perfectly with the Sony tablet S. Game play is smooth and easy to understand. The only thing I think that can be improved is being able to choose a difficulty leval when you play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this :D so many games!! I love the car one were u try to dodge the other cars
B0060FXDCG|5.0|No need to explain, if you are buying this, you have at least seen one of them or all and want it so you can view whenever you want.
0060989157|4.0|This book is good in that you get several different perspectives of the same story from the different players. You get to decide for yourself who is untruthful or just plain clueless. As far as the story goes it pretty much \\"Same Rocker Story\\"... At first a total loser, then getting some chicks from being in a band, then doing drugs with chicks and having sex with them, then falling in love with drugs & alcohol and still doing more chicks, Then getting signed and finally getting some money, then getting more drugs, more alcohol, hotter chicks, some jail and all kinds of cool cars, houses, motorcycles, etc... Then being stupid enough to impregnate or marry one, then losing half their possessions, kids/alimoney/child support, then going to rehab and fighting with guys in their band, fighting with their labels/managers then getting out, selling a \\"tell all\\" book to try an recuperate the money the bitch stole and trying to get the guys together for another run at more fame, more fortune and a Geritol World Tour. The Ego's of these guys is Insane. Without music and luck many of them would just be homeless people... I guess the beauty of these types of stories is that no matter how messed up any of us or our lives get it will never be as bad as these rockers was/is... Anyway, I've read about ten of these stories and this is my last one.
0545091020|5.0|If you want or need to pass idle hours driving, or find a way to stay awake while on the road, or need a way to keep children quiet, then buy the Hunger Games Audio CD (and the two sequels) by Suzanne Collins.  The reader is outstanding, and able to portray the various characters in believable fashion.  The strength is in the tale itself.  I arrived at my destination after two days of driving, barely remembering the tedious trip, as I was so entranced (as were my two children, a 12 year old boy and 16 year old girl).
1451648537|4.0|Being one that loves a great book, I first have to comment on the authors ability to pull the reader in and keep them reading.  This was a book that was well written, the author showed his skill and displayed the art of writing well in this book.  I will add that Steve Job's life provided a lot of drama to work with, but in the hands of a novice it could have easily been ruined.  The book was not only well written it was put together well, as the author went from chapter to chapter, you could see the thought and effort that was put into deciding what went next.  Sometimes the chapter ended leaving me with a question, then I'd turn the page and find the answer.  I remarked on that brillance, and I see why Job's chose Isaacon to write his Bio.    In Job's life you also get a small synoptic history on the explosion or maybe evolution of computers in America.  You get all of this without the dry details that you find in a history book, you get it in the context of Job's life as he navigates from his garage to 1-6 Infinite Loop in Cupertino,Ca.  You also realize that there probably are not many people whose lives were so centered in that evolution.  I remarked that this book was put together like a movie, if it's like a movie it would definitely be a \\"Pulp Fiction\\"!  Sometimes you got the end of one facet of the story, and in the next chapter you'd have to go back 10 years to get the beginning of another facet of his life.  However, the artistry of how well it was woven together was brilliant.   Lastly, there is a lot to take in when reading someone else's life.  I'm sure there could be more said about Job's, but after reading this I got a sense of knowing who he was, and what he stood for. The book was honest about who Job's was; he was driven, and prone to berating people. That of course gave the typical results of such driven people, a line of broken relationships, as he pressed on to fulfill his vision.  At the end, I love his \\"mantra\\" so to speak! The passion, and vision he had to create the next step in technology, but not just for the love of money, no for the love of the product. To produce a product that was excellent.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|This DVD reveals all of Michael Buble's on-stage charm plus contains some really entertaining background on his development and delightfully caring personality. I've a collection of Michael Buble CDs and this is my favorite. Plus, Amazon delivered this combo on time with standard shipping.
0451169514|5.0|****SPOILERS****A book of rich character development, a terrifying revelation in a town haunted by uhhh.....part of the macroverse as deadlights but physically as a spider alien that dwells in the sewers of Derry and feeds on the souls of humans. The other events that occur not related to IT (physically) are quite interesting and enjoyable like the second part of \\"Bill Denbrough beats the Devil.\\" This book also displays the good vs. evil theme which really forces you to read on. The bond between the main characters is a great story in itself with hardships, sexual occurrences that sometimes get a little too out of hand, and most importantly the \\"Other\\" which gives supernatural power to them in order to take on \\"IT.\\"
B00006RAKP|5.0|Whats not to love about Elton John? It great to have so many of his best stuff on 1  CD  -- good price and quality, and  it was delivered quickly!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|so far so good!  I cant say a whole lot since the app is asking me to rate it so early in my game play.  I am enjoying the variety and clarity on my kindle fire. no issues!

B0057UVLQ0|5.0|This is great album but one song bang bag bang almost souns like bullet proof by la roux. They probley took it from them Anyways very good album otherwise; oh and people there are many of young singers who ad a swear word or two. They arent all inocent as they look. Kids have hurd everythin now days no matter if you think they have or not. Come on every tv station has swears blankd out.
034552554X|5.0|Captivated and enthralled by this beautifully written story and left with a sad sense of separation from the characters upon its ending.  One of the best novels I have read, its exquisite message is a gift to each reader of the simple beauty and importance of our very human imperfections.  Ultimately Vanessa Diffenbaugh teaches us that we are perhaps not perfect but always deserving of both giving and receiving love.
B000002UW1|5.0|I would find it hard to argue that Document is not REM's finest album from start to finish. Not sure why birds play such a part in the album from the herons (\\"Disturbance at The Heron House\\") to the \\"King of Birds.\\"<br /><br />Of course, \\"It's The End of The World\\" gets all the attention now but listen to this album in its entirety and you can just tell this band hit a home run.
B001P06GX4|5.0|My family loved this game! We could not stop playing.  It appealed to young and old. A big plus. It can be very intricate. The more you play the more ways you discover. Excellent.
B000002LOE|5.0|There's a weird country twist in both tone and sound (\\"Texarkana\\" and \\"Country Feedback\\") and maybe that's what the title refers to of these tunes being out of another time.<br /><br />Whatever. Far be it for me to analyze whatever it is Michael Stipey is on about, I just dig the sounds and how he slaps lyrics together over that sound. This album showed a bit of a shift for the band but it's one that had to be done (how long can you survive in the \\"Radio Free Europe\\" college radio mode anyway?).
B005I2YL4G|5.0|A truly lovely chip for those wanting value and energy savings. Make sure to upgrade the graphics driver when you install, [...] If you're not a game freak, but want a simple chip that runs fast and solid, and does hd, the 3500 is a good riide. Might want to try a quieter fan, but the one included does just fine.
B000002UVZ|5.0|This is more like R.E.M. live sounds like, if you've grown up on the slower \\"Everybody Hurts\\" tracks in their career. From \\"begin The Begin,\\" \\"I Believe\\" and \\"Just A Touch\\" rock out to the supreme.<br /><br />Definitely a great bookend to the Document album. In a weird way, the hit single \\"Fall On Me\\" really seems a tad out of place on this killer CD.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|addictive game.much better than the original.I like the ability to upgrade the weapons.however I think it gets impossible too early.
B000002MU3|4.0|There are some good tunes on this album especially \\"Star 69\\" but overall this album misses its mark. This is probably where most long-time R.E.M. fans gave up on the band. It sort of marks the point where I'll still go see them live but I don't buy or download their new stuff really anymore.<br /><br />It's not that it's a bad album at all, it's just all over the place sonic-wise.<br /><br />As I post this there are 776 available starting from 1 cent. Go for it at that low price but I wouldn't fork over the $10 for the full album download.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The whole family enjoys this game. There is something for everyone 3- 63.  It will take us awhile to unlock the games but fun.
B000002LFU|4.0|Denis Leary does a great comedic riff on one of the songs off another album (\\"Shiny Happy People\\" on Out of Time) which does hit home about earnestness and \\"saving the Earth.\\" And laugh as I do at it, this Green album is still so solid I never let that get in the way of my enjoyment.<br /><br />\\"Orange Crush\\" and \\"World Leader Pretend\\" still hold up today. \\"Pop Song 89\\" sort of is a forerunner to \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" in its guitar riff.<br /><br />Anyway, the REMulans were still musically relevant when this came out so this is a must-download.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Works great on nook (CyanogenMod) . Fun game! Reminds me of my misspent youth in arcades. The upgrades and rebuild options are a great addition.
B003YOZNBU|1.0|this is what happens when you get \\"action movie\\" writers to make a screenplay for what should be more of a horror western. generic plot, generic malkovich bad guy, and barely any time spent on character development. i was going to spare the director since he did OK considering what he had to work with, but then i read on IMDB that he was responsible for the music. it wasn't bad music, but it had no place in this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really enjoy playing the many different kinds of games! download for free and get a lot fun things to pass the time. with!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is really fun and kills a lot of your time.The games are fun but some can be a good king of a challenge.
B000HC2LI0|2.0|I have tried 3 different CDs in 3 different DVD players and they do not work.  Everything looked great but they just do not seem to work.  Pretty much sucks but I get that's what happens when you buy something off here.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evermore really is a great application. It is especially helpful for me with organizing notes and documents. It is also helpful that all of my content automatically syncs to my phone and on-line. I can type notes on my computer, from my computer, or using my tablet and can access automatically updated notes from any of my devices. It would be nice to add a color option feature to be able to organize notes by color, similar to Spring Pad. Overall, Evernote is an awesome app. Definitely a keeper!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like it there are multiple games on this app that you can. okay. and they are all in different catigories
1451627289|3.0|I finished this the other night, and gave it a few days to sink in. I'm sure you know the plot revolves around time travel and saving president Kennedy. I was torn between giving this book 2 stars, but, because there is no 2.5, I rounded up. Some parts of this may have spoilers, but I'll try to keep them to a minimum.   All in all it started out pretty good. We get to see a couple of our old friends from Derry, and there is a red over white 1958 plymouth fury that shows up a few times (i dont think it's THAT Plymouth fury, but..). There are some interesting parts early on about the consequences of changing the future and its effects on a small family/a girl paralized by a bullet. Something goes wrong with the book around the time we get to the main objective- stopping Oswald. I can see how this book would irritate people who wanted straight up historical fiction. It's not. In fact, its more of a love story (King says he was going to dedicate this book to Jack Finney, who wrote the romantic/time travel/historical novel- Time and Again).   I can also see how it would irritate those looking for a action thriller, with a lot of jumping through time. It's not like that either. The Time door only leads to one date- Sept 9, 1958. The novel is probably a few hundred pages too long.  I read another review that said there was a good novel in here somewhere, you just have to find it.   The book deals more with a small Texas town where the main character waits (and waits and waits) for Oswald to arrive. I wont tell you if the president's life is spared, or what else happens. If your looking to kill a week and be entertained, I dont think you'll be too disapointed. If you're looking for an edge of the seat, supernatural, scary thrill ride, read something else. I suggest The Dead Zone. It has similar plot ideas (changing the future) and it's a much better story. I give this a 2.5 out of 5.  I should also point out to my conservative friends, that King dials back the leftist agenda in this one (I've said it before and i'll say it again- Under the Dome should be called i hate George Bush and Dick Cheney). Sure he takes his shots: there's a glaring dig at the Tea Party, and it seems like King will never be able to get over Bush. He throws in some global warming junk, and rewrites history making the republicans the party of racism. If you can just let your eyes glaze over this you will probably be able to make it through the book without vomiting.
0439023521|5.0|\\"Hunger Games\\" by Suzanne Collins was the most exhilarating book I have ever read. In the Hunger Games, 24 tributes are drawn from each district to participate in the Games. This is for the pleasure of the Capitol, who enjoy watching each tribute kill each other until only one person makes it out of the games alive. Throughout the book you will see what each tribute has to do to stay alive, the obstacles each character has to overcome, and what each character must do to fight for their life. Every Chapter drew me into the thoughts and emotions of one of the main characters Katniss Everdeen, who takes her sister Prim's place in the games. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are the tributes from district 12. In this book you will question the actions of character Peeta Mellark. Is he there to help Katniss Everdeen? To protect her? Or is he there to kill her and win the Hunger Games? This book makes you constantly ask questions. Each chapter I read left me on a cliffhanger, constantly wondering what would happen next! If you enjoy reading books with sacrifice, action, and romance this is the book for you! I think this book is good for any gender because there is a lot of action throughout the book, but there is also romance. \\"Hunger Games\\" isn't like any other book I've read. The entire time I read I was never bored. This book constantly kept me on my feet. Every chapter something suspenseful happened which drew me into read the next chapter. Read Hunger Games to find out what happens to the characters Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, you may be surprised!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun to play when bored but game controls don't work very well. there are lots of well thought out games though which makes it fun to play.

0307949508|5.0|This one seems to be the one Larsson truly wanted to write even before plotting out \\"the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" To me, this one is much more dynamic and insightful. But no means you can skip the first one; you should definitely be prepared for the characters and their relationships to enjoy the story at its best before turning the first page of this book.<br /><br />As I read I doubted that Larsson himself really fell in love with Salander. Maybe it's simply the amount if the pages spent to describe her or the way her secrets are revealed little by little or the intensity of the language used to show her in the story. In any way, even most cross-grained one can't resist loving her. As for Blomkvist in the beginning I find kind of funny in a way as he hops from one woman to another, but eventually I realized it's even essential quality of his to be a hero of this story. (though I'd say Salander is more like the hero than heroine)<br /><br />There are so many characters appearing as you go further (police, lesbian rock musicians, world-famous boxer...) and so many different situations you have to put yourself into but you'd never lose track of even a single character, nor would you find it hard to follow. It's Larsson's talent to uncomplicate otherwise too complex and intricate elements of the story. Rather every one of them naturally attracts us so that we can't help but associate ourselves with. It's interesting the way the characters tackle into solving the incident from their own standpoint: a police officer from police's, a journalist from journalist's, and a tiny, asocial, computer genius girl from hers own, etc.... Yes, there have been tons of crime stories over the time (like Citizen Kane some decades ago) that display multiple POV about one single problem. But I'm sure you'd still be amazed how clever Larsson presents so many various materials integrated in a single world.<br /><br />I haven't read \\"the Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" yet. I know I'd enjoy to some degree of course while I doubt if it's possible to enjoy more than \\"...Played with Fire. But anyway, I believe I'd come back here to write a review with 5 stars and hope to say \\"who said sequels never succeed?\\"rse while I doubt if it's possible to enjoy more than \\"...Played with Fire. But anyway, I believe I'd come back here to write a review with 5 stars and hope to say \\"who said sequels never succeed?\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is pretty good. Some games are pretty hard but its fun! Who rodent like games that include frogs and spaceships! haha
1844137872|5.0|I hardly ever write reviews on Amazon but this book is nothing short of amazing.   The combination of Banksy's art and his quotes will make you laugh and think like nothing else. I guarantee you.
0812973992|1.0|I got the distinct impression that author McCann was trying to pull off what Michael Cunningham succeeded in pulling off with his tour de force, \\"The Hours\\": three stories revolving around one (in that case, Virginia Woolf's masterpiece, \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\")<br /><br />Where Cunningham succeeded brilliantly, McCann simply falls flat. His choice of centerpiece character, Philip Petit, who tightrope-walked between the Twin Towers in August 1974, seems strained and odd because so many of his references suggest to the reader that he is in fact hinting at 9/11. It's a strange balancing act because he tries too hard to make the former as powerful as the latter, and it doesn't work.<br /><br />The biggest problem is the tedious inner dialogue of each character, none of whom are tied together until the end -- by which time many have been more or less forgotten by the reader because there was never enough to hold them together in the first place. However, if the reader can hold on long enough, there is a modicum of closure in the denouement.<br /><br />Ironically, the most satisfying part of the book is, in fact, not part of the novel at all. It is the first page and half of the Reader's Guide, \\"Walking an Inch Off the Ground,\\" where McCann recalls briefly the story of his father-in-law making it out of the North Tower on 9/11 and wading home through the dust and mayhem to McCann's apartment uptown.<br /><br />When I read this portion, I admit I felt a little smug, having guessed that 9/11 was indeed the inspiration for this novel. In fact, those few sentences are riveting, proof that McCann doesn't need to impress us with how many words he can type. It's too bad he didn't stick with his initial impulse and develop a story around that Twin Towers event instead of drumming up a peculiar, run-on and decidedly self-conscious series of \\"voices\\" that simply bore with their own dull theatrics.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I have this app for Kindle Fire and its fantastic. Great castle defence game that works perfect with a touch screen. Fun, chalanging after you get through a few levels and glitch free.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I loved Missile Command as a child. This game brings back those memories.  I love how you can upgrade your missiles here.  Easily five stars from me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun! for when you are on the road or just bored it is very entertaining!!!
B001U887M4|4.0|The delivery was fast and crocs fit perfectly. However, one of the buttons fell off very fast and now the lining comes off everytime I remove them from my feet.  Another button came off, but I was able to find it and place it back. I would like to purchase another of the croc BUTTON = how can I do this?  I was planning on purchasing more, but am unsure as the buttons fall off so easily.  Please reply if I am able to purchase a separate button.  Thanks for your prompt attention,  Vivian
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Works well with my iPad.  Plug and go, no complicated moving things around.  I loaded all my cards fast and I'm enjoying all my pix.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Day by day and hour by hour weather reports that includes extra tidbits of information like winds and UV index.  Easy to navigate and read.  It also has a map function to show any rain/snow in the area.  Other features include storing locations, video weather reports, and general news.
B004LWZW42|5.0|A very good prequel about the other x-men and what I liked about it was that it explaind how professer Xaiver came to be in a wheelchair. Five starts all the way!!!!!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|My husband and I have watched 9 of the 26 episodes. The history is accurate and well presented. We have learned information that we were unaware of before.
B00003CX95|5.0|A excellent tale of how Scottland won their independence from England. On a Scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 10! A very outstand movie.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a fun game. The touch screen works great and very responsive. This app works very well. This game is more fun than Atari's missile command.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was about the insufferable conditions under Hitler as he tried to rule the world. The war that he caused not only increased the suffering, but caused many to lose their lives. You have to root for the survivors after the war. However, after their suffering, you wonder if they did have anything like good lives. Highly recommend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it. it is very fun, but it is too hard for me to earn points. very fun overall.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app, gives the current and forecast and even a map. I just wish it had more weather maps, like some of the others.  still it is a great free app.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|The sixth season of Doctor Who is in many ways like the fifth, with the same drama and intensity, sprinkled with some lighter episodes so as not to get to heavy and dark. Amy, Rory, and River continue to travel with the Doctor, and along the way we learn about River's past, and how that relates to the Doctor's future. Amy is pregnant, or possibly not pregnant, we aren't sure, but the Doctor will get to the bottom of it. Just a warning though: the season finale is a bit of a cliff-hanger. Not an \\"oh god what will happen next\\" style cliff-hanger, just a \\"but you haven't explained x, y, and z!\\" cliff-hanger. This is annoying, since the next season doesn't even begin in the UK until September 2012, so we will have to wait a very long time for our doctor fix.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Just like missile command but easier to control. Reminds me of when I was a kid, but this one is better.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|Several versions of the film a nifty collector's case and an excellent film.  GG's! You can't go wrong with this movie.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I always enjoy reading John Grisham books. He is among my favorite authors. I don't normally read fiction books but for John Grisham, Zane Grey, and a very few others I make an exception.<br /><br />The Litigators, like most Grisham books, is one of those books that are difficult to put down. One gets to know most of the characters and be rooting for them.<br /><br />This is a great book about a young lawyer who changes jobs from a high-powered firm to a small boutique firm and is much happier in the bargain.<br /><br />I think you will like reading this book. I sure did.
B0036TGT3E|3.0|After reading the reviews for this movie when it came out I thought I was going to be blown away when I watched it.  I bought it and watched it for the first time with my daughter and I have to say while it is not bad it did not meet my expectations.  I have seen other contemporary children's films that I consider much better, including Up, Cars, Kung Fu Panda Beauty and the Beast
B005ZUR724|5.0|For what it is (a WoW clone), it does a great job. I've put in several hours already and have a character at level 20. This is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG). In other words, there are lots of other player controlled characters running around and doing quests at the same time as you. You can cooperate or ignore them. You can team up and run instances (greater monster difficulty, greater rewards). The drawbacks to the game are only natural. The small-ish screen (compared to a PC monitor) make some actions a little more difficult (like using a variety of different spells, items effectively in a time-crunch). However, if you want a large screen and lots of buttons, get a PC MMORPG. This is a mobile game, and it excels in its medium.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|Got this movie for Christmas....I enjoyed it.  It's well acted but formulaic.  You will enjoy it but it's no E.T.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Im not big on romance movies but this one is different. I really like the movie for the ship. I bought this version first and about a week later I bought the 3 disc set because I wanted to see all the special features. The acting is excellent, plot, storyline, everything. This is the only romance movie I have in my little collection of dvds. I mostly like action, karate and gangster/hood movies so this sits weirdly in my collection but I dont care. I just love this movie!
B0049GYXDG|3.0|My daughter enjoyed it but I consider this one of Disney's weaker films.  All films that end with the character waking up from a dream usually lose some points with me anyway.  Still if you get it at a good price it is worth it.
B001OQCV2E|3.0|The movie is good in the beginning but towards the middle and end it wears on and gets boring. The movie is 2 hours or so. I bought it used for $7, watched it once and about 4 months later traded it in to amazon.
B00368PSN2|4.0|This is a good \\"B\\" movie.  Basically its about some dude from another planet that lands here during the viking era but in standard fashion loses all his futuristic doodads and has to use viking stuff to hunt an alien monster. Its done well special effects could have been better but they are not horrible and this does not have an Avatar budget.  If you buy it you will enjoy it.
B002ZG99TA|3.0|Bought this movie thinking it will be good. It is but not as good as I thought. Its based on true events. The acting is good and the plot is good but I watched it once and wont again. I bought it used and paid like 5 bucks for it so its no big deal.
B005XQLBU4|2.0|not challenging at all. after 20 minutes you will feel bored. 20 20 20 20. . . . . . . .
B00005UW7V|2.0|Strangly when the movie came out on dvd back in 2001 I was about 16 years old and when I saw it I liked it a lot. We had the movie about 2 years after it came out and I sold the movie to FYE when they were still around. Fast forward to 2011 (thats when I bought the movie again, im just now doing a review)the movie wasnt as good to me as it was back when I was a teen. It was boring and I wished I never bought it but I believed I paid 5 bucks for it used so no big deal.

I decide whether a book is worth reading based on the synopsis and word of mouth. This will be short, I promise.

0385335997|4.0|I absolutely DEVOURED Outlander, but I thought Gabaldon really lost her tough in Dragonfly in Amber. It was too long, too much detail and too historic. Because I loved Outlander so much I thought I really had to give Gabaldon one more chance, and I am so glad I did.  The magic of Outlander is completely recreated in Voyager. The spark between Jamie and Claire is there, and the war and history of Scotland is secondary to the main plot line, where it belongs. I absolutely love the addition of Brianna as a character and am so relieved that Claire is back with Jamie where she belongs. After reading about these characters for over 2000 pages, it was amazing to see how their lives have changed 20 years later. I love the men that Fergus and young Ian have grown into, and I love the family that Jenny and Ian have created.  One thing I will say though, is that I agree with other readers who say that it is a bit unnecessary for Jamie to get into some kind of trouble in every.single.situation. Gabaldon has the poor guy basically fighting for his life, or Claires every time he uses a chamberpot. The crazy situations are a bit overdone, but I still really enjoyed this novel and can NOT wait to get my hands on the 4th installment.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of, if not the best, book I have ever read.  As the book unfolds, you can feel yourself getting to intimately know the characters in a way that is different from most other books; I hated the evil, snobbish Capitol people, but sympathized with the people of the districts.  Also, the storyline of the book is different and extremely exciting.  My favorite part is that this book is packed with emotion and action which make it almost impossible to put down.  There was really no part of this book that I did not absolutely love.  I highly recommend this book as long as you have a lot of free time when you start because you won't be able to put it down!  The best part is that this is a series, so there's much more action and passion to come.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|A classic game works great on the tablet. lots of fun and the touch control makes this a better game than then original.
B0030IIYYS|4.0|No introduction needed.  You might not think it's the best one of the trilogy so far, but it's really good and a must see.  Enjoy.
B0063GORYU|4.0|wonderful game . I play this game at bedtime to relax me! it's challenging and rewarding if I win.I share this game with my family and we challenge each other.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I don't think this really needs reviewing as it's a Disney timeless classic.  I'd never seen it before and bought it for my 4 year old son, love it, beautiful.  You can have new animation technology and movies look great but this is a classic and should never be changed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app! very easy to use! lots of fun! download this app now! lots of different games to choose from!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this game is progressively intense keeping you coming back for more. especially for guys, we like to blow stuff up
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great little that just provides a good game of chess! very simple. I've never had any problems with the game on my polaroid tablet
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like this app because it can tell you anything you want to know not just the weather where you live.works brest in the kindle fire. I recommend this app because now you don't have to wait for the weather in the news you can just look on the device you have.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun game but it can take awhile to get enough points to upgrade defense but still fun. Its a good time wasting game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is so much of a time passer you have to unlock games with points. if you have extra time in your day you should try it!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|trying out the free version for this app.  it's okay except all the adware.  I like the fact that it offers to auto complete, but wish it had a button to do that sooner.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|awesome I loved it and it was the greatest came ever. good work rovio. this is my favorite game the best
B003VANOFY|5.0|Fantastic product with really good price. Sound is perfect and helps a lot in Doom or other \\"strategy\\" games ;)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great fun! Reminds me of Missile Command. Hard to stop playing. Got to level 20. Works perfectly on Galaxy Nexus. Thanks, Dev!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|First of all, its a fun game but yyou have to shoot 3 or 4 missilies at another missile so it wont destroy your city and since the other missiles come so fast, you run out of missiles to shoot then you have to let the remaining missiles destroy your city!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Good way to kill time nothing special but it works. simple game, works good. what more can I say. not much.
B003460IWC|1.0|Sorry but I am not impressed with this only on Dvd works the others are for zone 2, whatever that means... The Dvd that works is great..  I live in Australia I didn't realize that the made different zone DVD's....  As you are sellar I thought that yu would know?
B005HSL626|4.0|hard and easy when playin' the ffuuuuuuuuunnnn game I got as free application of the day. I think it deserved to be free application of the day.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My niece loved this, and now of course has to buy a Blue Ray player!  Her sister had the movies, but is living away from home at college.  My niece is now moving to Florida to work for Disney and will have her own copies. Both nieces have been true Harry Potter fans--as is everyone in our family!  JKDM
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like these levels a lot and I'd wanna make more like these fantastic levels. and if I could, I add them to angry birds (poached eggs, mighty hoax, danger above, the big setup, ham em' high, mine and dine, and birrday party.)
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|Like its predecessor, PFC-2 gives you a an uplifting visual and auditory experience.  It is even better if you watch it with friends.  This makes a perfect Christmas gift.  This year I gave it to colleagues at work with a container of hot chocolate and a book.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|a game is not supposed to be super easy. this is difficult enough, but not too much so. I do find it a bit lacking in the content. limited upgrades, and basicly zero options.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|GREAT Movie!!! Can't believe this came after Batman & Robin (97). Great start for Nolan's film. Highly recommended. Picture quality looks amazing as well.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It starts out fairly easy, but gets harder quickly. It takes a lot of good reflex and hand/eye coordination. I would recommend  this game to all.
1600595871|5.0|Fast shipping and a great price. I loved it and I am excited to see just how much better I will get at book binding.
0525478817|5.0|I am not a John Green fan. To be honest, it kind of freaked me out that a thirty-four year-old man would write a novel from the perspective of a sixteen-year-old female with a condition he probably does not have. I tossed away Alaska after paragraphs upon paragraphs of romanticized language cultured to make teenage girls swoon. (\\"I was drizzle and she was hurricane\\"-- I mean, come ON.) I'd heard of the release of this novel on Tumblr, where Nerdfighters praised its soon-to-be existence and droned on and on about their excitement. The cover put me off, looking a bit juvenile for my own taste, but alas, the jacket was detached and I was bored at a birthday party and found this book and hastily read the first page.<br /><br />I was immediately drawn in.<br /><br />I'm not sure what it was about this novel, but I knew it was different. Something got to me and my heart and my head that made me confused in every sense of the word. Maybe I was encumbered by strong teenage vocabularies or that the characters were the kind of characters who would make fun of a disabled man because they know he wouldn't be offended by the joke. I felt them and I loved them. It wasn't the kind of character affection that made me want to be Harry, Ron and Hermione, who lived in a world I would not be allowed in. It wasn't Gena Showalter's Oh My Goth, which took place at a regular high school, but made its point with some weird science-fictiony twist (and a devastatingly poor method of analyzing stereotypes). It was not A Raisin In The Sun, which I must say was brilliant, but in a time and place I would never grow up to know. Something about this novel was real and it made me feel things I didn't know I could feel.<br /><br />I can't remember the last time I cried reading a work of fiction or the last time I wanted to pick a book up and read it again. You will cry and laugh and cry again and you will feel angry and sad and mad at the world, and if you're anything like me, you're going to want to cradle this book in your arms and stroke its spine saying, \\"Everything will be okay.\\" You will talk forever about it and you will analyze every word in its string of more words and you will know that everything was meant to be there. I might sound crazy to those who have not read it, but those who have will understand completely.<br /><br />Probably none of that made any sense because I'm still trapped in that mental desolation that you get after reading a good book. That should tell you everything you need to know.rms and stroke its spine saying, \\"Everything will be okay.\\" You will talk forever about it and you will analyze every word in its string of more words and you will know that everything was meant to be there.

B005K17RU0|5.0|nice app for kindle fire. no issues with the install or with the function of the app.  I would recommend this app.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very similar to the classic computer game.  Lots of fun and very challenging!  I found myself hooked on the game very quickly.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Doubtless, this is best book I've ever read. We have all have heard about the horrors of daily existence in North Korea but this book brings it to life and captivates us from beginning to end. Essential facts are provided in interesting and readable ways.  We learn about the mass starvation of the 1990's, the continuing personality cult of the leaders, the tales of torture in the gulags and many more grim details of this most repressive regime on earth.  That background information becomes much more meaningful as  we grow to love the characters of this book and cheer for each of them as we follow their harrowing lives and suspenseful journeys to freedom. I finished this book several weeks ago but the human stories and the reality that this disastrous regime is alive and well has continued to haunt me.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|This was a good and fast read. Chris Kyle is both proud and self depricating which makes it easy to like him. I think his wife was amazing and I would have loved to have a little more of her imput in the book even if the book was about him being a sniper. While I will agree with some readers that book is written very simply, I believe that it made it a much better read he dosen't get bogged down one story or another he keeps it moving quickly. My only complaint would be to much spec details on the guns. I would have much rather heard more from his wife Taya and how she dealt with his deployment. But overall a great read.
1451627289|2.0|Mainly disappointing because there are several opportunities for drama or interest, and none of them is really capitalized on.  The book also has some disjointed moods where it switches between genres and not all that successfully.    Without spoiling much, it's obvious we are going to see some kind of post non-assassination world here, whatever the final outcome.  What a bore, like a draft Star Trek episode.  The bulk of the story is an improbably complicated love story with an overhang of domestic violence.  While there is a lot of Oswald voyeuristically observed from afar, the book does not really commit to that story, and finds little of interest there, or little to ad drama or insight.  The greatest achievement there is how living through the timeline of Oswald, and his ordinariness supports the official explanation, if one is inclined to it.  King quotes several historical sources as the base for his take on the assassination.  The two principal sources are well known establishment figures with a history of plagiarism.  He claims to have done a great deal of research, and it may be reflected in the day to day descriptions of Oswald.  But if so, this is undermined by the sci fi backdrop.  King writes well, and on that basis deserves a higher rating, but the tale is repetitive, long, and for the most part uneventful.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game. I really enjoyed playing muddle defender and found the application worked well on my Fire tablet.  I suggest you find out for free if possible.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It Is So Much Fun!!!!! I love this app!!!! It is absolutely  amazing! I will definitely recommend this app all my friends!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A great game, fun, addicting and time consuming. It runs smoothly on my Samsung stratosphere. Thanks amazon for the free game.
B005T87QCI|1.0|worst app ever, waste of money and waste of time. The movie is a lot better than the cheap game
0887307280|5.0|If you're thinking about opening up a business this book is a must read! It will give you a quick view into all the personalities that reside inside of business owners and how to deal with all the concerns that they present when you're knee deep in growing your business.
B0064T6LV8|1.0|This game stinks. It just does all the work for you  rarley hit the ball so your just sitting there watching the game play itself.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|game is a lot of fun and keeps you entertained for a.long time because of so many options. really enjoying it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wow I have never had so much fun in my entire life they should make more games like this wow so much fun I never relisied. how much I enjoy this
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play and understand like the original computer game. Appears you can only play the game with three card draw, other than, very easy to adapt to for whole family.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|angry birds is so much fun and all the other ones are awesome.Rovio Entertainment Ltd. should keep making angry birds.  it is so addicting.  :)
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Loved this book, yet again I am impressed by Kevin Hearne's brilliant writing and the imaginative story-line. This series has never disappointed me ever since I bought the first book.
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|I downloaded this because I do like to draw but not too much, the other reveiws convinced to get it and now I wished I didn't because it just so stupid. I mean sure, if you have a kindle and you want your kid to shut up while waiting anywhere or just for a car ride, its perfect for that, but anything else its just a waste if memory and money. DONT BUY!!!!
0545265355|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas, he loves reading. He had never heard of these books, after the first 10 pages or so he was hooked, absolutely loved the books and is reading them again he reads quiet fast only took him 2 days to read all 3. Still can't stop thanking me for the great books.   So great trilogy highly recommend this book if you like this kind of genre. :)
B006VA57CY|5.0|Love every minute of this series.  The show is perfectly cast.  I can't remember the last time I enjoyed tv this much.  Maybe not since the Band of Brothers.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It can be hard to find clean, funny kids movies but this one meets all those criteria.
B0000046PE|5.0|Ella Fitzgerald / First lady of Song (3 CD set - Verve):  This is a truly great set.  These are the classic tracks from her time with Verve from 1949 to 1966.  Five Stars<br />This does come in a `book' form that is larger then the typical CD case and the three CD's are in envelopes in the book.  This may be inconvenient for some, but don't let that keep you from having these great tracks.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are fun and just challenging enough to hold your attention. 20 unlocked and no problems so far. I would recommend.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|easy to learn very addicting. fun for all ages. longevity is questionable because of limited weapon upgrades and visuals....not enough variety. Galaxy S II
0743454537|3.0|The book was pretty good.  I can't say it's one that I was compelled to read in a day, but it was interesting enough to read until I got to the ending.  I feel it is such a betrayal to the book....kind of like when you read something and then the person wakes up and it was a dream.  I actually like the movie better than the book, and that was because the ending was better suited to the storyline.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|excellent game, much better than the older version I played 20 years ago, but the same idea. good upgrades and action
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is awsome and anyone can play it. I would recommend it to anyone. please play it. try it and you will like it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|l use the YouVersion Bible everyday. I use the text to speech feature to learn to pronounce the names of people and places.
B006OT03BM|2.0|amazon should hold off until the release of the items before you can't make a review. you have idiots  on here giving the opinion on the movie but not the item itself.  I'm doing my review on the french version of this item.  The item is cheaply made. not worth the extra money for a stupid cardboard cutout.
B004TTZHBK|2.0|When I first downloaded this the update worked great but now that I have a new phone it is not working and has not been working for months
0393061310|5.0|Great book! I've been wanting to read it for years and I was glad to find it on here for a reasonable price !
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great! Just like Atari's Missile Command. Update graphics and sounds. Highly recommend to everyone that can download this. It is awesome and worth way more thab what they sell it for at the app store. Go ahead and give it a try.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't really understand the negative reviews on this one. I loved it almost as much as I loved the first book. The second book to me seemed like a waste as it was only there to bridge the first and third book.  The ending was a little weird for me as it was somewhat anti-climactic. As if a large portion of it should have been the epilogue.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I now have this app on both my smart phone and my kindle fire.  Not only is it great to have my Bible with me everywhere I go, but I enjoy having my reading plan remind me daily to stay in God's word.  Our church is now using this app as well, so I can follow along with the sermon notes during the service. Love it!
B0058VW36U|5.0|greatest app ever and I cant stop playing!! never imagined it would be this addicting!buy you wont regret it! have fun cutting da rope!!:)
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fast free download. Bright and simple graphics. Minimal advertisement interruptions to other card games and they show up at the beginning of the game.
B005LAJ1O0|1.0|American Horror Story Starts off like its being rushed, then slows down to a somewhat medium. The problem I have with this show is that its more of a mini series than a full series tv show. The Actors are great, well some, Check out Jessica Lange, she's insanely good. The horror, the drama, and storyline is definitely there. But As always moronic Ryan Murphy ruins the show. The last episode is full of plot holes it's ridiculous.  But it turns out that the creator is completely done with this haunting story and will start a brand new story next season with a new cast( Goodbye Jessica). So I waste 12 hours of my life on this show to get no answers and now I got to look at a whole new story. No thanks , I'm done and thanks Ryan Murphy for being an idiot, you ruin nip/tuck, glee sucks, and now this, anytime I hear or see your name I will walk away.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|gives me something entertaining to do while I'm bored. Some of the games do seem impossible though which can get frusterating.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|The display on my tv looks even better than the IPad display because of the cleaner whites. I'm using with a 15ft HDMI cable.  Works fine with the OnSong app (which is the reason for my purchase, so I can use iPad to display song chords as a music stand, and project the words on an external display).  Disappointing that iPhone 3 and  iPod gen 7 won't work with it.  Also carries the sound and can be used with eg iTunes to play music over HDMI. The sound quality is reasonably good but not as good as a CD and is similar to what you'd get with an AV cable plugged into the headphone jack. I had hoped for better.   The fact that you can connect the iPad and also charge it is very good. I'm not sure if the replicated iPad connector can be used simultaneously with other iPad add-on gadgets, anyone know?
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas. MY husband is so in love with Star Wars, You could ask him anything about it and could tell you everything. He'll sit for hours reading when he has nothing to do about Star Wars. So when he opened this he was very very please on how good it was and seein him so please made me very happy that I got this... It was about 64 in the stores so I also saved money buying it from amazon and it got to my in germany within the month what made me even happier.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I'll try to review this for those with average technical skills (since that's what I call mine, hah!).  I bought this as well as numerous other parts during the black friday/cyber monday sales to put together a very adequate computer. Note that this is a AM3+ socket!! At its release, a lot of motherboards didn't have the socket support for AM3+ yet, but they are definitely out now. As a suggestion, check out ASRock's extreme boards, and always do research before you buy. Furthermore, try not to take Benchmarks as the end-all to buying a processor. A CPU for this price and speed will do everything you want it to, unless you're rendering large 3D models or video editing professionally (but you shouldn't be looking in this price range, anyway). Potentially, you can get the support for this AM3+ socket now (as it will be the new AMD socket type for a few generations), and upgrade later when \\"Piledriver\\" releases or you have some extra cash for an upgrade. This is a \\"Bulldozer\\" AMD product, and has a 7.2 on the WEI (Windows Experience Index).  To note, this processor supports up to 1866mhz memory speeds without toying with OC'ing, but making it easier to OC the CPU compared to Phenoms (nothing against Phenoms, just relaying information). Albeit, I read that it will only do this with 2 sticks, but trying to fill all 4 busses puts strain on the memory controller anyway... so try to get maybe 8gb in 2 slots (2x4gb). This processor compares to Intel's i5-760, which is about $215 (1/16/2012).  Also, Windows was still behind on supporting FX processors when they were released for multi-threading. There will be a release or 2 in Windows updates later this year that helps support these processors in multi-threading applications better (affecting games/applications that utilize 2 cores and over). However, you may not see the true efficiency of multiple cores until Windows 8, or when it becomes common practice for developers to utilize multi-core CPUs.  Get this processor for casual gaming with a low-mid level graphics card. All this for a gaming computer that can handle all the new and online games for around $500. (If you have the patients, skill, and desire, try to push this over 4.0ghz to get the true potential of this CPU).  Budget build invoice (reflects non-sale price):  CASE-ELITE 430 RC-430-KWN1 RT - $39.99  CPU AMD 4-CORE FX-4100 3.6G - $109.99  MB ASROCK 970 EXTREME3 970 AM3+ - $84.99  MEM 4Gx2 (8Gb) CRUCIAL BL2KIT51264RF160A - $34.99  Sapphire Radeon HD 5670 - $69.99  LG 22X Super-Multi DVD Burner 22X DVD+R (OEM) - $17.99  LOGISYS 575W ATX12V SLI Ready Power Supply - $24.99  HITACHI HDS721050CLA362 (0F10381) 500GB 7200 RPM - $79.99 (may go down in price when Taiwan recovers from floods)  **Total: $462.92**  (Had a monitor/speakers already available)
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I downloaded NKJV to my Kindle Fire.  App is missing scripture, jumbles words together, and the highlight doesn't work offline. I am considering uninstalling unless these issues can be corrected.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I have read the other review and as suggested contacted the company via email to get a valid digital copy sent to me with a redemption code or just the iTunes redemtion code. They respond with a standard email on how to download/stream it through their website or app. I provided them with a valid UV redemption code so its not as if I am attempting to scam them. I am sick and tired of the industry trying to restrict DVD use once you buy it for those of us who are law abiding citizens and good luck stopping the thieves who thrive on your feeble roadblocks which in turn affects the rest of us. I will not be buying any ultra violet/digital copy DVD's, so it looks like I wont be buying many movies anymore.
1583334386|2.0|The will power part of the book was very interesting.  Seems like if one could put those practices to use, it could be life changing.  However, too much of the author's political views were put into the book.  If I wanted someone's political views forced on me, I would watch Fox News, CNN or MSNBC.  Unfortunately, the author lived up to the reputation of a stereotypical leftist professor.    I would only recommend buying this book if you are willing to overlook the liberal bias.
1416575464|5.0|This is a great book. Lovely photos. Highlight of the book for me: how-to articles on room by room decor.
B004XZ99LO|5.0|Great 3-D effects and good story to go along with the effects,use a vizio 43 passive tv sometimes where it shines is on a 3d projector. Then it's like your there under water, in the woods ,flying with the trapeze artist, you get the drift. Underwater ballet has great emotion, music, and 3-d effects.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really helps to distract and calm the mind in just a few minutes. I love this app whenever I need to stop and chill.
B0068AWQQ2|1.0|Saw the trailer. That's all I needed to see. The original is by far the best and all these movie remakes are ridiculous. No one has any style,taste or original thought anymore? Just copy and paste something out and the masses suck it down in droves. Wow! This is why I stopped watching tv along time ago. No originality or sense of excellence to be better! Glad I didn't spend my money or time watching this one!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Not a love story in the traditional sense, the characters, especially the main character Louisa drew me in completely and I could not put this book down. I knew the plot from reading a review and was torn between not wanting to read the end but not being able to put the book down. It's both a simple book and remarkably deep. Thoroughly recommended.
0062101897|5.0|We enjoyed the book - learning about the magic behind the magic - and highly recommend it to Harry Potter fans.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Same game I played 15 years ago on the pc, great game. It is even better that it is free.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Even if it was not free I could pay 99 cents for this game. fun way to kill some time
1451627289|5.0|Just finished this about an hour ago, and I have to say King has done it again!  Although some of the basic premises of the book eerily reminded me of Back to the Future 2, King always seems to create characters that you become emotionally invested again, the hallmark of a good fiction writer.  Highly recommended.
0811879542|5.0|I'm another reviewer who was skeptical about the reception this book would get from my toddler. The whole book consists essentially of painted circles. No pretty pictures and no cute story line. But imagine my surprise when such a simply-drawn book captured my then-2.5-year old's complete attention. 6 months later, she still adores this book. And we can't read it just once ... it's always 5 or 6 times every time we sit down to read this one. She prefers to read it together, but when I can't sit down with her right then, she is also content to \\"read\\" the book herself, and has memorized the simple instructions on each page.  I wish I could find more books like this. We purchased several more books by this author but they are based on a completely different concept, although she does enjoy the mix-and-match art books.
B00026WU82|5.0|One simply cannot explain how influential this album was in Rock and Roll history. Dylan took his amazing poetic talents and amalgomated them to the electric blues while transforming his lyricism from the topical to the surreal. The result is the single greatest album in rock and roll history, and , along with Robert Johnson's Blues, Louis Armstrong's Hot Five and Sevens, Miles Davis' Kind of Blue and the Beatles Rubber Soul/ Revolver, one of the pivotal recordings of 20thCentury popular music. The 45 it spawned -A side of Like a Rolling Stone, B side of Positively Fourth Street - is pure genius, and proof that Dylan must have been channeling some sort of perverse creative power. Absolutely<br />brilliant.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this app a lot its pretty fun but some are really hard this app is good for long car trips and when ur bored
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like the app for the reading plans. I do not like the fact that I cannot access it in church even though the church does have wifi it just refuses to connect.
B004J88SGC|2.0|How many more ways can we make a buck rehashing and repackaging  the same material? That seems to be the extent of creativity going on in the Joel camp this past DECADE.  Same songs, played the same way, pretty much in the same order for the past 15-18 years. The documentary is much more interesting and the new Legacy edition release of Piano Man at least contains a vintage live performance. Like the 2000 Years: The Millennium Show, this one should only be bought by completists.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is the best missile defense game I've ever played. Thank you for including it as the free app of the day.
B000EHSVQE|5.0|I've watched this movie many times with my three children, we all love it!  One Halloween my son dressed as Napoleon, down to the dragging super hero doll.  Some people recognized who he was and laughed out loud.  Others just didn't get it.  That's how this movie effects people who watch it.  If you 'get it' you love it.  I just started collecting figures from the movie, even they make me laugh!  It is the most quotable movie I've ever seen.  All you haters, lighten up.  Take it for what it is, a day in the life of an oblivious un-cool kid who deals with his weird reality the only way he knows how, by being Napoleon.
0716748789|5.0|I am very happy with this book.Book is in used condition with doggy hears.Other then that perfect condition. Arrived in good time as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is such a great game I play it every day is so much fun that I am writing a great great great review for it
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Would have been worth paying for.  Excellent update to the classic missile command Atari 2600 game. very smooth action. addictive little game
B006JPS1OM|5.0|This game is great. It has a very fun &amp; interesting genre. I would definitely recommend this to other people. If there is a series or will be one for this game you can count me in on playing through the game.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is the best missile defense game I've tried. Simple, but lots of fun. The poor quality sound is all that holds it back from five stars.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is good for my little sister she loves that they are hard but not too hard. that is why I gave it a 3.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun. definitely had to read how to play them at first. once I did, I had a ball trying to get points
0439023513|3.0|1. Prim survives the final attack and goes on to be an amazing doctor.  2. Katniss chooses to be with Peeta - really chooses to be with him, not because it's inevitable.  3. Gale eventually gets over Katniss.  4. Finnick doesn't die in the tunnels. Maybe he gets badly injured but survives to return to Annie and his son.  5. Haymitch struggles with his addiction but gets help from Katniss and her family.  6. Katniss mends her relationship with her mother. War makes them grow closer, not apart.  I know war does terrible things to people. But I would've still liked this story to end with hope. It sort of did - but there wasn't enough hope to satisfy me.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Bought this to give as a gift . It wasn't available locally , so I went to amazon . It seems when I cant find something locally I go to amazon  they always seem to have all hard to find items I look for.
B006QVRUS2|5.0|This was a great and fun/funny film. A drama where two kids parents meet at ones apartment to decide \\"how to handle\\" the situation where one of the boys hit another boy with a stick, knocking out teeth. Who's fault was it? Who should apologize to whom? Should the parents get involved? Should they also take responsibility for their kids aggression and the others timidness? We learn the issue of aggression and short comings might be more so with the parents, than with the kids. And that poor hamster? A film by Roman Polanski, more so a short dinner theater type play brought to film. The shortest film I've seen in a theater. 1 hr 15 min. But great stars, fun plot. Things go from simple casual attempt(s) between two sets of parents with coming to an agreement concerning responsibility for their kids actions, to the parents engaged in something close to total WWIII. With a little apple cobbler tossed in (and up) along with way, plus way too many social cocktails in the mix. And a busy cell phone adding to the never ending comedy-drama.  With stars this wonderful, this film is a must see hit. And again... that poor hamster.  There are great court room dramas that keep you engaged. This is not a court room drama, but equal to such as a social drama between agreeing/disagreeing, then agreeing then back to disagreeing sets of parents.  With everyone carrying, then unloading, a lot of psychological baggage.   And YOU are the fly on the wall.   Great! Very fun! Interesting! Too short. I wanted more, a lot more. But what Roman Polanski gives us is totally worth experiencing.   Great directing mixed with great actors/acting really does make the difference.  NOTE: And just who was that peeking out the next door apartment at all the ruckus going on in the hall way? Could it have been by chance a VERY FAMOUS DIRECTOR's face????  And no... it wasn't Alfred Hitchcock. lol  What a good film. What good acting. Great stars. Great director. Great directing. But I'd totally skip the cobbler...
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It was a christmas gift for my daughter how can i review something that was given as a  gift duh duh!!!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I recently got Angry Birds for my cell phone and just got Rio for my Fire. It's gorgeous on this screen size! It plays beautifully and the audio sounds great. I recommend this as a must-have game for the Fire.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Yes, it is a love story that spans the ages. Dawson and Amanda meet in high school and fall so deeply in love that time nor can distance alter their bond. He is a kid from the wrong side of the tracks with a family so downright scary that it's a wonder he escaped unscathed. She is a privileged rich girl from a prominent North Carolina family whose social ties and expectations have grown tiresome. She falls for Dawson like a dog in heat. Well don't get too comfortable because of course they are brutally separated by those forces conspiring to separate them. Fast forward twenty-five years and they are reunited, brought back to their childhood homes for the funeral of a mutual friend, a gruff but kindly old geezer by the name of Tuck who harbored several secrets to be uncovered by Dawson and Amanda. Dawson also must come to terms for his part in the accidental death of the town's young doctor when he was just nineteen years old and for which he spent four years in prison. Now in their early forties Dawson and Amanda must decide if their love is worth saving. I won't give too much away but bear in mind that children and one spouse are involved.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was less than thrilled at the ending. Actually, I hated the way the book ended which is why I can't figure out why I continue to read this Spark's books. It is chick lit at its finest. It also offers the unique perspective of being written by a man. I know that the formula indicates tragedy in one form or another but this story doled out so much that I was practically choking on it. You will have absolutely no problem figuring out the ending well beforehand. There are really no surprises at all. Sparks is great at dotting all i's and crossing t's. He is masterful at building the story to a fevered pitch and his pacing is brilliant. Still, I always feel this inexplicable sadness after I am done reading one of his novels. On second thought, my sadness is probably not that mysterious at all. Who among us isn't a sucker for a love so withstanding? The thing that bugs me about Sparks is that he is very much an author with no reach, never traveling outside his narrowly defined comfort zone. On Amazon, his interview stated that since it had been some time since he wrote, The Notebook, it was time for another reunion story? This statement smacks of pressure to eke out another best seller. Who other than Sparks would get away with such an easy out? This speaks to the dark side of authors so well established that they do not need to even try anymore. This novel is entertaining, don't get me wrong, however one needs only to read works by up and coming authors with talent who haven't yet sold out to the man to see the difference. I don't believe a novel should remind one of how cruel the publishing world is.t a sucker for a love so withstanding?

B005XQLBU4|4.0|got the app cause it was free, but turned out to be really fun! its a little addictive once you understand the game. I got good pretty quick.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Allows you to access your home computer in real-time from your kindle fire.  Picture quality and frame-rate are great!  Tried netflix and espn3 with no issues like stuttering.  Simply amazing if you have technologically-challenged family or friends.  They install the free streamer software and you can remotely help them!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a very awesome game, a lot of fun to play. I would  recommend this game to all ages.
0307346617|5.0|I borrowed the book from a friend who suggested it. Given that I love zombie-related fiction and anything apocolyptica themed I was expecting to want to add it to my collection. But I was not expecting to be so enthralled that I literally did not want to put it down. I have since had it swiped from me twice, as others who have borrowed it never returned it! I will continue to replace it, though. I've read it multiple times, as it has great re-readable content.
B002KKBVAQ|3.0|I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. I though the toy would be really fun for building. The magnetic pieces are fun and she enjoys the toy, but I thought the panels were magnetic as well so we would be able to have a lot more versatility in building than with just the rods and balls. However, there aren't very many rods and balls to build with and the majority of the kit is just different shapes of the plastic insertable pieces. They don't stay in place very well and you can't build much with the 114 piece set. I would definitely go with only rods next time and not buy the panels, as you could build a lot more for the same amount of money, and the panels are useless unless you have the structure built to pop them into.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game with lots of other mini games mixed in and though the grspichs are so so it is still a very fun game
1416550550|5.0|Forgotten Garden follows the lives of four generations of women, weaving back and forth from England and Australia, through the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries. It's a tale of how the riddle of their lives is to be solved through the fairy tales written by Eliza, \\"The Authoress\\". The book requires a bit of work to keep track of the characters, something I don't always appreciate. However, this novel is endearing to its core, therefore, the effort was a blessing, not a curse for prolonging the experience.<br /><br />Books of this nature often require incredible coincidences for things to fall into place and Forgotten Garden is no exception. There were some truly amazing coincidences between details of this book and my own life, which made me smile. Just as I was thinking, \\"Now don't go too far Kate Morton\\" an astounding connection to my own life presented itself. And then, four pages later, another. How can one not hang up one's own pessimism at this point.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book so much from cover to cover that I savored it rather than charging through.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|They have a program for anyone that is interested in reading the Bible.  No excuses.  Great app. I highly recommend you give it a try.
B0002BO05S|5.0|This is a very old religious classic. Well done film and nominated for five academy awards. It brought back nice memories of Sunday school and teachings from the bible. This one I would recommend for viewing around the holidays. A welcome addition to my collection.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|def worth the 99 cents. Easy to learn and excel at. I would recommend to anyone looking to spend a buck on a game.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This game gets old really fast. It would be nice if there were some objectives our something to make it more interesting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy and love the ease of use and the best part is that it has audible feature which makes me enjoy Bible reading.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|The good: Plug it in and wait a few seconds. You're done pairing! All my controls work and the size is the smallest i've seen. Great design.  The bad: Battery life is greatly reduced on my ipod nano 6th gen.  I would recommend this for people who want bluetooth, but don't use their ipod for hours at a time.
B0058VW36U|5.0|After 3 weeks I have gotten 3 stars on every level of every box.  Great way to spend time and never gets boring.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|These games are sometimes frustrating however you find yourself trying until you complete them. It is a little annoying that you have to keep replaying games in order to get enough points to unlock other games, but overall I find they are a good way to kill some time.
0525478817|5.0|Absolutely and without a doubt, TFIOS is a stunning book. John Green has not ceased to amaze me with his remarkable talent. Don't hesitate to buy this book-- it will be one that will stick with you for a lifetime. Better yet, don't hesitate to buy any book that John Green wrote.  I've already loaned my copy to my sister.  Nerdfighters, my J Scribble is in purple.  Also, DFTBA.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a great way to kill time I play this almost all the time . if they came out with 1001 games + 29 I would buy the second it came out so I say buy it:)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game on kindle fire.probably my favorite games.I have paid like 5$ for games that wherent nearly as good as this.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|lots of fun. brings back great childhood memories.  easy to play on kindle touch screen. takes a little strategy. to figure out what upgrades to make first.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. I unlocked all the levels by buying the star key. Just click on a locked level for a couple of time and then there is a pop-up that says &quot; Can't wait then buy the star key just for $0.99.&quot; Anyways I wonder why when there will be more levels.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|great game, was hoping for some extra bad guys besides missels.  but still alot of fun.  so much easier than the old missle command track ball.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this has been the easiest way for me to read the Bible,  and it makes me want to read more being able to have it read to me.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|works great on my HP Touchpad. I love the intensity. reminds me of missile command from back in true day.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works good on the Kindle Fire. Would be great if it offered more advanced radar options, ie. storm tracks. otherwise, works fine.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Simple but really fun and addictive. They took the old Atari classic and added the ability to upgrade weapon speed, blast radius, duration, and missile quantity.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its great i love this app it has so many different games in one u would have to download so many indivual apps in one....
B001UV4XHY|4.0|This DVD is excellent, as are all of the Harry Potter Movies. The Only complaint I have<br />for this and Part Two of this feature is that it is not available in full screen as are<br />all of the other seven movies to this series. For everyone who has purchased the first<br />seven DVD's in full screen, it ruins the collection when the last ones are not available<br />in the same format. A lot of people will end up feeling ripped off, who don't like the<br />movies in wide screen presentation. I for one am tired of movie collections starting out<br />giving you a choice, and then ending with only one format available. The spiderman series<br />did the same thing. The first two were available in both formats, but the third was only<br />available in widescreen. Then to make matters worse, everytime this happens, it's always<br />the widescreen with the largest black bars, instead of the small ones, making the picture<br />even smaller. Even on a big screen TV it's like watching a movie through two slats in a<br />fence. You'd think if they were only going to offer one aspect ratio, that they would<br />compromise and use the format with the smallest black bars and largest picture. You'd<br />also think that if they're going to start a series of movies with a continuing story,<br />that all of the movies would be released in the same format. I Love the Harry Potter<br />movies from beginning to end, but I'm certainly not going to re purchase the entire<br />set just to get them in the same format, no matter how cheap the price. Once I've purchased<br />a show, I think that should be that. So to the manufacturers of these DVD's which have<br />numerous sequels, please finish what you start. I feel ripped off everytime you do this.<br />As for the movie, it was great. These stories were great from beginning to end. Great job<br />on bringing these stories to film. I highly reccommend all of the Harry Potter movies, but<br />only wish all eight were available in fullscreen.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun to learn, fun to play. This is one of the best games I have downloaded in quite a while.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Works well on my evo. Challenging enough to hold my attention. Overall an enjoyable game to pass the time with.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a pretty fun game.  it is definitely good for killing time if you want quick games to browse through.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is great! Tons of fun if you like simple games to just pass time on or if you just like mini games.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Reminded me of playing MC when I was younger.  A good way to waste away an afternoon.  enjoy the game
0525478817|5.0|Markus Zusak was right in his review, \\"The Fault in Our Stars is John Green at his best. You laugh, you cry, and then you come back for more.\\" I finished this book within a day, unable to put the book down. I was emotionally attached and deeply moved. The book literally had me wiping away my tears in one scene and laughing the next.   The book stays with you. After I finished reading, I sat there, stunned and just thinking for awhile, not quite capable of digesting it all yet quite ready to go back to the book and read again. This is a great book and quite easily the best young adult book I've ever read.  I can't wait for John Green's next work.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|I have used both screens and was very careful to try and smooth our the bubbles. I was unable to do this and the result is horrible.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Seems to be pretty neat. some games a little twitchy but still fun.  all in all a lot of fun games.
0896762629|5.0|Amazing to say the least.    This is the best book in her series, (I loved them all so far) and the attention to detail is meticulous.  I just received the book and slowly turned page by page, even getting out my magnifying glass to see the ever so smallest details.    \\"Wow\\" is all i kept saying in my first go round.    I am happy that there is a way to duplicate these garments due to the calculations & measurements all being there and also the methods, photos and drawings.  The price pales when you have this item in hand.  Bravo Janet.  I am so sorry you are already gone, because I would write you some well deserved thank you's.  Thank you!    Even if one does not get to sew any of these works of art-   it is worth having this book to pore over and transport you to another era.    5++ stars
B004Y1WCDE|4.0|There is room for improvement.  It force closes sometimes when opening a video.  Overall it works very nicely.  I have the sprint evo3d.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A good game responsive controls on a HTC Inspire, the game would probably be better on a tablet, due to being cramped on a phone
B000AP04NI|1.0|I was so excited to see this movie, my husband bought it for me and I have always heard so much about it that I couldn't wait! I love musicals and I own many. But this one was a disapointment, the ballet was done poorly and the dream sequence...ARGH!! horrible! The plot was lost in the dancing. Musicals are great! I love them! But go watch singing in the Rain or Seven Brides for Seven Brothers! This movie kinda sucked the life out of me. I had to watch Harvey Girls after it just to cheer me up! (oh, and this movie isn't even filmed in Oklahoma, It's filmed in Arizona.)  review written by~ Miranda Sutton.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is a lot of fun! Some games are easy and some games are hard. I recommend playing this game!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|write many notes once....then sync your other devices. the color-coding, multiple formats, and ability to dial from within, or go to a webpage makes this super-convenient.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very enjoyable remake and improvement on the classic Missle Defense game. GREAT on a touch screen. Much more playable than using a mouse or controller.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I purchased this for Christmas for my three sons and myself to try and if we like it to purchase three more. I love the blade thinkness, this thing will take a beating and keep going, the handle I'm not 100% in love with, I think what I will do, when finances allow, I will upgrade to micarta handles. This is a GREAT knife for the price. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a great deal on a strong blade.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|This is a great fifth season.My whole family loves it.It was in new condition.They were fast with shipping.Great to buy from.Thanks

1590171993|4.0|Stoner is the story of an inconsequential man, the author tells us so right at the start, then proceeds to prove himself wrong.  Even the \\"smallest\\" existence can be so full of life, so full of meaning, Williams seems to be saying.  John Stoner grows up dirt poor but discovers a passion for literature and becomes a teacher at Columbia University.  The book chronicles university life and politics, love, marriage and parenthood and finally, the thoughts a man has as he prepares himself for departure from this world.  The book is very quiet and elegantly written.  It is also profoundly sad.  At every turn, Stoner is denied happiness, and yet he faces every situation with integrity and stoicism, like his farmer parents.  Life is endured, not enjoyed.  \\"...within a month he knew that his marriage was a failure; within a year he stopped hoping that it would improve. He learned silence and did not insist upon his love.\\"  For all it's sadness, the book is strangely compelling.  Williams' insights into the working of human relationships are timeless.  And his eloquent prose is an absolute pleasure to read and has a poignancy that I found deeply moving.  Rating: thoroughly readable
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I don't like it because it took forever to download. I will never recomend this game. This is why I don't like it.
0547366205|5.0|Great book, hardy board pages and teaches kids that although we may look different we're all basically the same with \\"ten fingers and ten toes\\". My two year old loves this book and the cheerful rhyming tone of the words.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great especially on the kindle fire!!! It will keep you busy for hours and it never crashes!!! I would highly recommend it!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Excellent spider solitaire game.  Very flexible ruleset allows hundreds of game variants because of the customizable rules.  Highly recommended for any solitaire fan.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|I will say this, Movies that Marcus directs I will be VERY VERY discerning to watch from now on. I looked so forward to this movie. I do not like anime and I've seen anime movie's directed better. \\"Any one want a free copy?\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a fun set of games to play.  some are kind of dumb but still fun to play. the sudko game makes for a good time
0062082353|1.0|\\"Bumped Out\\"...A term the author uses all too frequently. I regret having purchased much less read this book. At best it gets one-star rating for SEAL teams only and not the author's account of his involvement in the Iraq War. I cannot remember reading such a poorly written book, ever. This is not the work of silent SF professionals. This sniper's portrayal missed the mark altogether. Better books on the SEAL community come from authors like Dick Couch who you admittedly disrespect.  And yes, SEAL operations are TEAM oriented not cowboy insertions with disrespect to \\"head shed\\" officers and its command.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Have watched the first 3 parts and love it. Interesting to see how laws were so against women in England years ago. Received it very quickly. Have already preordered the 2nd season.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This could be the best useful app I have on my phone. I was lucky enough to get it on free app of the day...but would have paid full price for it if I had to...some minor bugs, and typing is a hassle sometimes, but come on...this app is GREAT!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is an okay app some of the games are cool some of the games are crappy. all in all its an okay app.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very simple game to get a hang of and a lot of fun. It runs flawlessly on galaxy nexus. Great pick Amazon!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun game, when I'm not doing much, it keeps you entertained, some of the games are really silly but fun for children.
1419702238|5.0|My son has all the other books so I wanted to get him this one for Chirstmas. The book was in excelent condition.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok so far.  the controls are difficult.  finger dragging is slow for games that are fast paced.  other than that its fun.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is amazing! Just as beautiful as the original. The puzzles are well designed and original. Also, best soundtrack of any game in the market.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this app is really fun u can make a check list or a note and u can change the Coleridge of ur not and u can mark a calender so it is really handy
1423140591|3.0|I love Percy Jackson. Honstly I do, but this book fell short of my expectations. I would have prefered to have gotten a little more familiar with the Roman camp. It all seemed kinda laggy untill the end when it felt rushed. Like he just kinda compacted everything into the end. I would have rather had a bit more detail throughout the book instead of at the end. It isn't my favorite Rick Riordan book, but mabe he will do better next time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so far its good and unique. so I like it and will cont to play this game. again I like it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|great tool for learning and staying on top my studding habits.  I just wish I could get it to work better on my kindle fire without the Internet connection.  other than that it is a great tool.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|runs well, its fun and when its not the free app anymore its worth the buck, good time killer I highly reccommend.
B002ZG997M|5.0|A man walks through desolate wilderness of a broken world. He suffers from thirst and hunger, wears rags and sleeps in ruins and other fortune hideouts. He must protect himself from the deadly blazing sun during the day and a not less deadly cold at night. He is lonely, as he crosses few people on the road - and amongst those he meets, most are thieves, bandits, madmen and cannibals. Although not yet old, he is not a young man anymore and his strength slowly abandons him. Scars and burns cover his skin, the stigmata of his personal Via Dolorosa. And he can not stop as he carries a heavy burden, and he would rather die than abandon it, as he must bring it to a safe place - which he didn't find yet. His name is Eli (Denzel Washington) and he has been walking like that for the last thirty years...<br /><br />\\"The book of Eli\\", as one of the previous reviewers mentioned, is basically a mixture of \\"Mad Max 2\\" and \\"The Road\\", but with one very special element which distinguishes it from all other post-apocalyptic movies I saw - a very powerful Christian message. Because the burden Eli carries is the last Bible that exists in this devastated world. And two perils threaten this treasure - that it is destroyed, or even worse, that it fells into wrong hands...<br /><br />The wrong hands in this story belong to a certain Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a ruthless, cruel, but cunning and ambitious man, who rules tyrannically over the only \\"town\\" lost in the middle of desolation. His power is based mainly on the control of the only source of clean water in his vast domain. He used his power to gather a community in which people are protected from thirst, hunger and roaming cannibals - but where there is little freedom and where brutish thugs serving Carnegie are aristocracy, bulling the powerless plebeians. Carnegie wants to expand his domain and rise from a local boss to a king, but he is not certain if his little army can achieve that. He believes however, that if he owned a Bible and could preach its message to scattered remnants of humanity, he could become quite easily the supreme religious, political and military leader of a kingdom.<br /><br />The unavoidable confrontation between Eli and Carnegie includes some action scenes, but it is essentially spiritual and contains some very simple but powerful lessons. At one moment Eli recites the famous psalm 23: \\" The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death; I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.\\" And the whole movie is actually mostly an illustration of this prayer - a message of encouragement to the righteous.<br /><br />But there is also a warning for the wicked - even if you lay your hands on the greatest treasures of the Earth, soon they will turn to dust which will slip between your fingers... And the thing that I liked particularly in this movie, is that director and scenario writer decided, that the Almighty sometimes simply can not resist to play a particularly naughty, even vicious joke at the expense of the villains...)))<br /><br />Another great treasure of this movie is THE twist before the end, which changes completely the way we perceived EVERYTHING that happened before, a little like the revelation in the \\"Sixth sense\\" (but just to be precise, NO, it is not the same revelation!). This twist has its importance. I must humbly admit that in the beginning I was not thrilled by this film and I almost stopped watching it after 10 minutes - but I forced myself to continue and I was ultimately greatly rewarded. When the film was finished, I immediately rewatched it a second time, because once you know THE twist, the whole film is changed and it is really worthy to be seen again.<br /><br />Although this is mostly a Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman show, I also liked to see Jennifer Beals and Malcolm McDowell in smaller but important supporting roles. On another hand, Mila Kunis, although quite present on the screen, is not allowed to play a lot, as her character is there mainly to give Eli an occasion to speak and let us know a little about him and his story. It is not very fair for her, but she plays this auxilliary role with grace.<br /><br />Finally, I must admit that being a Christian I may not be entirely objective when reviewing this film and OK, maybe I liked it a little bit more than it desserves. But still, it made quite an impression on me and I can not give it anything less than five stars - and the final message of \\"The book of Eli\\", which is also the title of this review, taken from the New Testament, is splendid and a very powerful one.d, I immediately rewatched it a second time, because once you know THE twist, the whole film is changed and it is really worthy to be seen again.

B003Y5H4SY|5.0|Surprisingly clever and cleverly surprising - a quite succesful film about the Devil in the elevator...<br />I liked this movie much more than I expected, from the first scenes until the very last sentence.<br /><br />Contrary to many other reviewers I rather like M. Night Shyamalan style and I appreciated not only his &#34;Sixth Sense&#34;, but also &#34;The village&#34;, &#34;Lady in the Water&#34; and even &#34;The Last Airbender&#34; - so this may be because of my personal taste that I liked &#34;Devil&#34; so much. But still, I think there are some very good elements in this movie, which make it enjoyable for just anybody - below some examples, with very limited SPOILERS:<br /><br />- the opening scenes - I will not tell you exactly what happens, but the film begins with a very special vision of our world (on the example of the good city of Philadelphia) and it immediately creates an atmosphere of unease and fear, which will later slowly but regularly escalate with every minute...<br /><br />- the music - it is a subtler and more delicate but still quite threatening variation on the &#34;Omen&#34; soundtrack; the music is extremely well used to strengthen the impact of words and images<br /><br />- actors - they are all unknown (at least they were to me) and that is a good thing, because we have absolutely not a clue who will make it until the end and who will die in the first minutes...<br /><br />- the claustrophobic setting - most of the film takes place in a blocked elevator, in which lights flicker and sometimes vanish completely, before returning - OK, may be it seems a kind of rather easy and old trick, but it worked for me...<br /><br />- mystery - I absolutely couldn't figure who was the Devil until the end - the final surprise is well preserved<br /><br />- the Devil - he is quite terrifying when finally revealed, in a very particular way - although you will probably have to digest the scene of his appearance for a moment before you fully realise how scary it is...; also I liked the explanation of how and why exactly the Devil is allowed (for a limited time) to come in this world in a material form (and not just as a spirit whispering bad advice in our ears)<br /><br />- a rather respectful approach to the Christianity - as opposite to most of recent movies, the one pious person appearing in the movie is not a babbling fool or raving fanatic, but a simple but brave fellow who in his very simple ways shows unexpectedly more useful knowledge and real wisdom that all the highly educated, but rather cynical people surrounding him; I liked this quite a lot<br /><br />Now, this is just a movie, so the director and the scenario writer had to take some liberties with Christian dogma - in which it is plainly explained that Satan has no material control of this world and can not do any physical harm to people - he is Temptation, not Murder; and if he can torment us with bad thoughts, he can not as much as touch one of our hairs; but once again, this is just a movie - and the final result of this (little) heresy is so pleasant (or unpleasant if you prefer), that I fully forgive the author and the director<br /><br />Bottom line - I liked this movie quite a lot; OK, it is not &#34;Omen&#34; or &#34;Exorcist&#34;, but still, it is a very very clever and surprising horror movie - with an exceptionally good punch line.scary it is...; also I liked the explanation of how and why exactly the Devil is allowed (for a limited time) to come in this world in a material form (and not just as a spirit whispering bad advice in our ears)<br /><br />- a rather respectful approach to the Christianity - as opposite to most of recent movies, the one pious person appearing in the movie is not a babbling fool or raving fanatic, but a simple but brave fellow who in his very simple ways shows unexpectedly more useful knowledge and real wisdom that all the highly educated, but rather cynical people surrounding him; I liked this quite a lot<br /><br />Now, this is just a movie, so the director and the scenario writer had to take some liberties with Christian dogma - in which it is plainly explained that Satan has no material control of this world and can not do any physical harm to people - he is Temptation, not Murder; and if he can torment us with bad thoughts, he can not as much as touch one of our hairs; but once again, this is just a movie - and the final result of this (little) heresy is so pleasant (or unpleasant if you prefer), that I fully forgive the author and the director<br /><br />Bottom line - I liked this movie quite a lot; OK, it is not &#34;Omen&#34; or &#34;Exorcist&#34;, but still, it is a very very clever and surprising horror movie - with an exceptionally good punch line.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun but hard at some times. it is a great game to get for the kindle fire. although there are too many adds
B0054JZC6E|4.0|simple, fun, silly ways to pass the time. free and varied-would definitely recommend to others!!! can't wait to unlock more games!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is a great game for touchscreen!  luv being able to upgrade and repair between levels.  don't miss this one.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Quite a fine game. Thank you Epic Pixel! The game plays well on my Kindle Fire.  Brings back happy memories of Atari Missile Command.
0307474275|4.0|\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" was actually quite good. It was a great mystery novel with nice twists and turns that nobody would expect to happen. The storyline was incredible, and the explanation of the historic background of everything actually was not boring. Remember though, that the facts of these cults, groups, and others are not factually correct, most of them are just explanation of conspiracy theories. The author really built somewhat of a relationship with the characters in the book and the reader. It was a real shocking and disbelief when a character turned out to be someone else. Overall, this book was a good read, it was very entertaining and was not dull at all. I totally recommend it!<br /><br />BTW, this review is coming from a 14 year old.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the greatest game ive ever played on my kindle if u didn't think ur gonna buy it st first but buy it anyway its great
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game has very nice gameplay. The difficulty level keeps increasing with change in level. It's fun to play. It might get repetitive after long play, although I have not reached upto that point.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is a verry fun and addictive game I can't stop playing it and I like tat you can change what you are feeding it
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Just like the old days only better. I've been playing it all day. Its alot of fun. Worth the price.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I came to this book because I'd been wondering how people could be so irrational in their political judgments, and then I started considering that it may not even be reasonable to expect rational political judgments from people. This book is about all kinds of decisions, and it confirmed my emerging hunch, because Kahnemann convincingly demonstrates that most of our decisions of all sorts are not made rationally at all. It is not that they are irrational, it's just that they are made through automatic processes of which we have no conscious experience, and whose underlying basis is neither rational nor irrational. Kahnemann's genius is in offering questions from research surveys that give readers a chance to witness their own non-rational, automatic processes at work. I made a giant pest of myself with these, as I could not stifle my desire to try them out on anyone around. They are seriously fun, and each one illustrates a different fact about how we actually think, whether we know it or not. If you haven't already learned about the research this book clearly and lucidly explains--and chances are, unless you are a specialist, you haven't--you are missing out on critical, astonishing information about how your own mind really works.
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|I am very satisfied with this purchase. My son is 3 yrs old and he loves to take pictures. He usually grabs my very expensive camera or my iPhone to take pictures, so I had to find a camera that he can have of his own. This camera is very durable and for the cost, I am very happy with it!
B002LFAHBO|4.0|If you have the dvd the director tells you that the movie was originally over 3 hours long and they cut quite a few scenes. This is actually part of the bonus footage. I thought for sure then when it was time to release this film on dvd the director would lovingly restore the chopped footage back as part of the movie since it was clear during his narrative that he only removed some of these scenes to shorten the film. Sadly, this is not the case. The movie is still just slightly over two hours and while it works, it would have been slightly more enjoyable with the bonus footage added back into the original film to make the \\"ultimate\\" Love Actually Directors Cut. Maybe he's be reading my comments or someone else's and release a directors cut bluray in a few more years. That would truly be the icing on top. However, don't let my comments put you off. This is a great movie and one that belongs in your collection.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Love the blue ray quality & the fact that it is colorized & in B & W! Great purchase! I will definitely look at similar purchases in the future!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|As a child of the 80's I loved this little page turner.  The author uses a fairly straight forward plot but creates a very believable dystopian future which makes the book interesting.  The 80's references are wonderful and the video game references while mostly out of my knowledge range would make this real great tale for the uber game geek.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|i love this app...this makes it so easy to keep up with my reading and it makes it easy to take notes while i am at church. I used to use this app on my phone in church but.now on my kindle, its so much easier to manage.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game is really fun and I enjoy using it but some of the games are really hard to unlock but is still enjoy playing it.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|it is a nice little game for youngsters. as the puzzles get up in the 70's they start making no sense at all. still a very sweet little game.
B005UT29Z0|3.0|As a non-financially savvy layperson who reads widely and tries to understand what's actually going on in the world, I grasp better than the common Joe how deregulation and high-stakes gambling infected Wall Street, resulting in a global financial meltdown. Still, I was confused by the tradingspeak on which the events depicted in this movie depend. Paradoxically, the plot about the dire meltdown emergency and the based-on-true company's \\"survival\\" response was so plodding that I noticed several times that I was bored with it.<br /><br />It started out promising enough, with heads being surgically chopped off by the greedy, ruthless corporate axe. We get a palpable glimpse into the high-stress world of Wall Street trading as well as its utter emptiness. Back-stabbing and ironies abound, and some pictures are worth a thousand words&mdash;like the honcho coming in to shave in the company bathroom in the pre-dawn hours before the sell-off where the underling trader, who has been loudly weeping in a stall, tries to put on the emblematic wooden professional mask while being inhumanely ignored. But the sell-off happens too quickly for its scope and devastation to be appreciated, and the consequences to the global financial system and the \\"little people\\" of Main Street go unexplored.<br /><br />I did get a clue as to why real-world traders at post-bailout financial institutions were paid outrageous bonuses for failure. This did not elicit any sympathy on my part for the traders, however, because this movie makes it clear that generosity on the part of \\"Mac the Knife\\" corporate heads and the honoring of commitments to employees are nonexistent on Wall Street. (On the contrary, this solidified my sense that, in the real world, they are all in-cahoots greedy bastards.)<br /><br />When the pivot point in the movie arrives, and we are ready for some retrospective analysis, it abruptly ends. This left me feeling like a bucket of cold water had been poured over my head. Was that the point? Kevin Spacey, as always, delivers, but the ending was just plain weird. What was that? A metaphor for his integrity or (unbelievable) naivete sacrificed on the altar of vulture capitalism?he point? Kevin Spacey, as always, delivers, but the ending was just plain weird. What was that?

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very entertaining, and highly addicting! Great mix of strategy and reflexes. A little twist on regular defense games. Recommended? Yes.
B002JCSRKC|5.0|I always thought and still think some croc shoes are ugly.  However, I was in the market for rainboots for a papermaking art class.  I was afraid after reading the other reviews that these would not fit me.  I am a usual size 8 and that's what I ordered and the fit is fine.  They work great and I hope will stand up to my art class.  I could not go wrong for 30 dollar rainboots!  I will update and see how they last.<br />UPDATE- these boots lasted through my hard papermaking course where I was in a wet studio.  They still look brand new compared to others that also took the same course and had purchased brand new rainboots for the class.
B005K17RU0|5.0|runs smooth, works brilliant on my kindle fire. the maps load quickly and the forecasts are easily understood.<br />thanks for a good product.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I'm confused because on my kindle fire it shows this for 99 cents but on the free side it says it free so get the free one!I still think the app is addictive and fun:/
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Many bible versions,  great calendar and recommendations for success,  good tracking and sharing of progress, strongly recommend to anyone interested in daily bible study,  five stars
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good games a good challenge with some of them but overall very good just wish you could get more points with some of the games
B005HSL626|5.0|It's a wonderful app even,though the ads are annoying my 6 year old cousin loves it on kindle fire.... She even  got all the blades. It's wonderful enough said
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that this app has so many different versions of the Bible to choose from. I also enjoy the read aloud feature especially when I am running late in the mornings. and I can listen to my daily reading while getting ready. I LOVE THIS APP!
B005COO1X6|1.0|Let me start by saying I love Stephen King. I think he is an amazingly talented man who can grip my heart in many ways (The Long Walk). I respect him and admire him. His way of getting into a child's head is downright creepy (Cujo and It).  This book sucks. Honestly, I felt like it should be on some Nickelodeon or Disney channel movie. The writing was so bad... and he would not stop rambling... I found myself skipping paragraphs out of frustration. Then, out of nowhere, it ended. Very anti-climatic. It is definitely not worth $1.99.   I love me some Stephen King, but he was very distracted when he wrote this one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it could be better on some of the games and some could be harder on some of them but over all it is a really good games
B004X30XPC|5.0|I bought this as a gift and the person I bought it for was very excited!  Thank you for putting this item for sale.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is so awesome I can play it for hours. some times it is hard but my mom,sister,brother,and I enjoy it.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|If you're looking for a quick, easy, and simple app for jotting a note, move on. This app needs a tutorial to get started. There is another colorful sticky-note style app out there for those who want simplicity.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very addicting but it could be much more better.  But overall I like. It deserves three stars only though.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|After the first few levels, it gets a little tough. It's not a bad game, and since I got it free, I can't exactly complain.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|pretty cool awesome AMAZING 101 GAmes. p p p p p p p p l ppl are dum if they don't play this tame

B0064X7FVE|5.0|the weather channel app is a very nice app thanks :-) I have a kindle fire and it works really well! hopefully it snows here in oregon :-)
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This was very promising.  I've been looking for a modern take on the classic Missile Command.  However, I found this game not very challenging.  It only gets exciting at night #30+.  Not a lot of repeat value (going through nights 1 to 29 for the payoff later).  I also don't like the fact that destroyed missiles don't have secondary explosions that can kill additional missiles.  I played it twice (to night 37 and 43) and I think I'm done!  The nicest thing about Missile Command was at later levels one started by building a carpet of exposions in the sky.  That is missing from this game (trying it at later nights is not as satisfying as there are no secondary explosions).
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|Eventhough CD's seem to going away, we still love to have them on shelf, atleast ones of our favorite artists.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|super easy to use, good translations. I also like the variety of reading plans available. the reminder function is also great! def recommend.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I loved this game. I am going to add it to my favorites. The ladybug is really cute, and the music is fun.
B004LWZW4W|3.0|I will get the bad out of the way first. While movies are subjective I do not expect people who enjoyed the movie to agree with me and that is fine. I found the movie had so much potential but failed to deliver. Part of me was hoping for more of the traditional theme of past Planet Ape movies and was wishing there was some control over the humans as in we answered to the apes, just like past movies starting with the originals. This was just more of them having semi intelligence and not acting like humans, role reversal.<br />I felt for a movie barely over an hour and a half long that it moved too slow to get to the point and when they got to the point, the action scenese were everything I saw in the trailers etc..<br />I liked Mark Wahlburgs version much better and the end of that movie led me to think there would be a sequal but sadly, this was not it as they took a whole other direction in what the apes would do..<br /><br />Now the good, the blu ray edition is excellent. Very crisp, good detail, colors etc. I watched this on a 52 inch LCD 1080p tv and it was stunning. It did have the black bars at top and bottom but I am used to that now as many movies are shot in that format.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It's a great thing to be able to access my home computer from anywhere in the house. This app worked perfectly the first time I used it on the kindle fire and every time after! Great app that I use almost every day. Coolest thing I use it for is as a \\"remote\\" for my music library.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I bought this game yesterday when it offered as free. I downloaded it for a couple of reasons: 1) I'm a HUGE fan of the tower defense genre. 2) Why not? It was free. But when I started playing, I was instantly sucked into this game's simple and addictive gameplay.  Now, while I do recommend this game....when I say it's &quot;simple&quot;, I really do mean simple. Not the game itself (which gradually reaches intense levels of difficulty) but its features. You are armed with one type of missile to defend your small city - and that's it. You can upgrade them with the points you earn, but that's still it. The same can almost be said for the enemy, too, except that they also have nukes. And some variety in setting would be nice, as well, but that's nitpicking.  Overall, &quot;Missile Defender&quot; is a simple, fun little app that will (more than once) leave you wondering where the last hour went.
B004I744AS|5.0|Best dictionary online.  Use it on Android and Windows exclusively.  Great to try out the different features: Word of the Day, Spelling Bee, Birthday, etc.
1416511946|4.0|I could not wait to read this book after reading all the positive reviews and I plowed through it eagerly. Nikki is such an inspiring person, in terms of his music, writing, photography, and his years as a drug addicted member of the Crue...The interesting part of this book, is how they go back and interview the people closest to him during this year in his life that the diaries are written about. Getting their perspectives on what he had chronicled made it more credible, and gives the reader an even clearer picture of how out of control it got. I don't think too many people would be so brave as to publish their diaries for the world to read, written during the darkest, most desperate time in his young life. This was an incredible book, and you will be awestruck that he even survived at the close of the book. I also highly recommend Nikki's book \\"This is gonna Hurt\\"--another amazing, inspiring book!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I reccomend this game for everyone. it is a very fun game. very easy games. I just hate that I have to keep on playing the other games over and over to un lock another game
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This app is amazing but my only problem is that they no longer update anything.... ever. its like its not supported anymore
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I really like the game, yes it makes you pull your hair out but that's the challenge. The only problem i have is that it seems it was made for bigger screens than my Optimus as it occasionally missfires or i can't hit the spot i want. other than its good
B006MW3VC4|5.0|A fantastic story, beautifully filmed and expertly written.  Each week we look forward to another episode of this wonderful period piece.  The story lines draw the viewer in and keep you captivated the entire time.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I wouldn't hesitate a minute to purchase these episodes.  These episodes are the unedited UK versions and have extra scenes not shown on the aired PBS version.  When most first-run movies today are more than $10 a ticket (and not nearly as good at DA), the $2.99 an episode for the HD version is an absolute bargain.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought this book, and had people tell me it was from the juvinielle section.  But I didn't care there are fantastic books from the same genre, Twilight, or Harry Potter.  I think it is a good competitor with these series.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|this would be a really great app if it had a radar, but it is still works great for getting weather quickly.
B005FVA3LK|4.0|This item came very quickly, and exactly as described. Shipped carefully, so arrived in great condition. My only complaint is that the DVDs in the box set would not play on my Samsung Bluray player, even though they are described as NTSC, i think because they were \\"made in Germany\\", they might be under a different dvd code not recognized by my player. Luckily, we were able to put it in our xbox and it played. thank goodness--otherwise i would have been an unhappy girl. still love the box set- the artwork that comes with it is amazing!
B002QEXN2K|4.0|The album is good and the songs are great too! I was at first under the impression that Continuum was a far superior album, but the songs on Battle Studies are really good too!
B005FWPSPK|5.0|I ordered the Achtung Baby Deluxe Vinyl Box set for my fiance who is a huge U2 fan. It arrived in  time, as described, in excellent condition! I am very happy with my purchase from this vendor.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Downloaded as the free app of the day, but would have been worth the 99 cents, works great on my droid X
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this application. There a lot of different fun games to play that are also interesting! I definitely recommend this game!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fantastic take on Atari's classic Missile Command,  with a few new features that keep the game fun and frantic. As challenging as the classic,  this game is good fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great Bible APP!  A SUGGESTION I HAVE FOR future updates is one touch links to word meanings for more in depth study.  but this app serves my purposes ex excellently as is.
B005SAP45I|1.0|We were anxiously awaiting this movie and took our 3 young children to the theater when it opened. As big fans of the first Cars movie; we couldn't have been more disappointed in the sequel. This movie is unnecessarily violent and pushes the tired Hollywood theme of the evil oil company. I really wanted to walk out of the theater. Don't waste your time with this trash.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|Well, it's a blu-ray, and it plays on a blu-ray player, and if you are a fan of Sons of Anarchy then it's like a perfect combination.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Best free app I have gotten for the Kindle Fire.  Lose too many buildings to continue to upgrade, but am having fun defending ONE building.
B002N7W3NK|5.0|Late at night, after a long day. Pour a cool glass of wine, turn down the lights and slip \\"Diana Krall live in Rio\\" into the machine.  Life is good again.....
B0001WE6U2|5.0|nikon sunshade brought excellent but this shade but I lost and it is very useful, for Nikon, it is advisable.
0439023548|5.0|This book was great!  I love this trilogy of books and highly recommend that others read the series.  It is a really cool series.  Love it, Love it, Love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a really fun game for everybody in the family. Test it out its really fun. I hope you enjoy
0316056863|2.0|I am a huge Tina Fey fan.  I really love her writing on SNL and her work on 30 Rock.  She is one of the true talents of this generation.  However, in reading Bossypants, I am taking the position that this book is way over-hyped.  Beyond the jokes and insights in the first few chapters, I found that the humor, storyline, thought process in the book got very stale very quickly.  By the middle of the book, I just wanted it to end already.  I know Tina's hot right now but I'm a firm believer that each work of art should be separately judged on its merits.  I think America's getting a bit blinded by Tina's star-power in making this a best seller.  Love Tina; did not like this book.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love this game and I got it for free anyone who says its repetitive has never played a missile defends game. And if you havent got it yet download it now.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|games are easy good for burning time. it made time @ bmv seem to go by faster. good for keeping kids occupied too

B002JVWRAE|5.0|This show really is fantastic! The first few episodes are a little slow, but once you get through them and the show starts to develop its worth it! Many of the characters I hated when I first started watching developed into characters I really liked. Even the \\"bad guys\\" are likable and interesting. The character and plot development in this show is one of the best I have ever seen. This is only time I felt like tv/film did the story better then the book.
B005HSL626|5.0|I luv it its fun and addicting I luv unlocking stuff and its free! What's there to complain about I mean everyone needs to have it! Although it does have many commercial adds. that are extremely dirty sometimes.

B005F6NA56|5.0|I purchased this CD for my wife after first hearing a selection on a favorite podcast of mine.  I really love the music and the lead singer's voice.  Very emotional and draws me in.  I've listened to this quite a bit lately.  Great purchase!

B005APT8A8|5.0|I'm tripping man -- I'm spacing . . . I'm FLYING!!!!!!<br /><br />This reviewer knows this library -- every note and nuance. Known it for years. But sitting here listening to this set, disc by disc . . . the music's about as good as anything the Beatles released, especially the stuff up to (and including) 1967. And then in 1968 they find a new and wonderful voice with a country twang that carries them to the end of their days. So what could be wrong with a CD set that is this potent and powerful, even on a veteran listener and fan? Not too much, but enough to talk about -- at least, to discuss.<br /><br />It's difficult (and a shame) to argue against (or even about) a 13-CD box that assembles as much good music in one place as this one does. But here goes -- the good and bad sides of this set are one and the same -- the complete 11 original albums issued by the Byrds are represented here, each with the bonus tracks from the 1996-2000 individual CD reissues of their albums; and therein lies the bad side, as any fan serious enough to be attracted to this set will almost certainly already have the 11 albums contained here. (Or, say, 9 of the 11 -- Byrdmaniax and Farther Along are fine albums in this writer's view, but they are the acid test of a true fan's depth; anyone who claims to be one and can get by without those might be considered \\"Type B\\" and those who own them proudly could be considered \\"Type A\\"). Of course, the presence of the bonus tracks also means that odd A- and B-sides such as \\"Lady Friend\\" and \\"She Don't Care About Time\\" are here as well, so there aren't any loose ends on that score. As they say, though, timing is everything -- to have issued this set, say, in 1996, AHEAD of the individual reissues of the albums would have made more sense, though it's nice to know it's here. (And the reason for the 12th and 13th discs is that this has the two-disc Legacy Edition of Sweetheart of the Rodeo and the expanded 2-CD version of Untitled, i.e. Untitled/Unissued).<br /><br />We could get into a long philosophical/artistic discussion about the use of the expanded albums -- the Byrds' original albums, even the very late ones, had a beautiful symmetry, not too different from that of the Beatles', the Rolling Stones', or the Who's work, and the bonus tracks generally don't add anything of comparable quality, even if they do tie-up loose-ends. So the presence of the bonus tracks is a bit like tampering with a masterpiece, in these particular instances (I've begun to appreciate the way that the Queen library and a few others have been approached lately, leaving the original album configuration intact and inviolate, and putting the bonus tracks onto a second CD; then again, this writer also has a carousel-type player, which makes that arrangement very convenient). The Legacy version of Sweetheart of the Rodeo, in particular, didn't really add a great deal to the 1996-vintage bonus-track single CD in our estimation, and it's not clear that any of the extra tracks added significantly to what was already a true musical classic (and masterpiece). The reality seems to be, however, that, for a variety of reasons, Sony wasn't going to return to the original 12-song (or less) originals (only EMI seems to want to do that, with the Beach Boys' early albums on those budget-priced doubles out of Australia or whatever market they're coming from, and that's a different kind of reissue from this . . . .). So we were always going to get those bonus cuts. Among Sony artists, even assuming that anyone still around actually cares and would say something about these albums, only Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and maybe Barbra Streisand (and perhaps Michael Jackson's lawyers?) seem to have the contractual clout to make demands of that sort concerning their reissues. So we won't get into that here.<br /><br />Sony Music might have provided more of a service to, say, have put out a smaller box built on the original mono mixes of the first five (or six-- did Sweetheart of the Rodeo have a mono mix? Perhaps in England only?) albums. Except, of course, that Audio Fidelity or whatever they're calling themselves has been issuing those, under license from Sony, as premium-priced gold discs (and we're still waiting for the monos on FIFTH DIMENSION and TURN TURN TURN, as of early 2012). Or Sony could have gone back and taken another crack at remastering the ORIGINAL stereo mixes on the first four albums -- come on guys, scour the WHOLE WORLD this time and check out every stereo master tape in every vault -- and used those in this set. What we have here are the Bob Irwin remixes/remasterings, which sound great but do lack some of the sheer power and depth on the early albums that the originals had -- that raw, blooming, booming energy that made them seem to pour like molten gold out of the cheapest AM radio speaker or whatever passed for a \\"stereo\\" in most teenagers' rooms in 1965-66.<br /><br />As with the earlier Sony Classical \\"Original Jacket\\" sets, each album comes in a mini-LP cover (without an inner-sleeve -- be careful removing and replacing the CDs unless you want scratches to proliferate), and there's a booklet that reprints the notes on the separate songs from the late 1990s reissues (but not the David Fricke overview essays, OR the original jacket notes, in the case of Mr. Tambourine Man etc.). In all, it's not as half-assed as some of those classical original jacket boxes from the last decade, though it's still not something that any serious fan except for a true completist with a big budget is likely to run out and get, or feel they have to.<br /><br />But when the music's playing, it is pretty neat, and no one will argue about that!

1451648537|4.0|I have never been an Apple \\"fan\\" (i.e. first Apple product was the iPad) and didn't follow Apple (Jobs) at all over the years.  However, I'm not blind to the fact that Apple has a huge following so I decided to read this to acquire a little history on Apple the company and Jobs the man.<br /><br />The book itself - I don't have any complaints.<br /><br />What I took away from the book - I was surprised to learn that he wasn't the \\"technical guru\\" and \\"inventor-type\\" that I thought he was but more a visionary and salesman.  It seems he got what he wanted, to help mankind progress, but unfortunately it was at the expense of those who knew and cared about him. In the end, I find it ironic that Apple became exactly what Jobs hated (as depicted in the infamous 1984 ad) - Big Brother.

B0053Q9DQI|1.0|Cary Fukunaga's 2011 \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a boring, dreary, monochromatic, misconceived botch. Fukunaga doesn't know who Charlotte Bronte is, but he sure knows his Igmar Bergman. He takes a wild, beloved and accessible book about a vibrantly alive girl and turns it into a pointlessly morose, dry and impenetrable film class experiment. One must ask: why was this film even made? There are so many adaptations of \\"Jane Eyre\\" out there, including a zombie version - made before the current zombie trend. Who felt a pressing need for a sotto-voce, mud-colored, depressive and anemic \\"Jane Eyre\\" without adequate lighting?<br /><br />From the first scenes, watching this movie was tooth-grinding torture. Fukunaga's decision to make the film without lighting was a mistake. A dull, gray palette does not equate great art. If nothing else, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the most colorful books ever written: there are physical fights, screaming mad women, burning castles, calculating belles, tortured and dying orphans, the reunion of long-lost relatives and long-lost lovers, psychic communication, murder attempts, big dogs, and fetching French dancing girls. There are profoundly poignant relationships, not just between Jane and Rochester, but between Jane and Bessie, a servant in her aunt's home, Jane and Helen Burns, a fellow orphan, and Jane and her student, Adele. You really can't film all that in an unlit, dun-colored setting with near-catatonic performances and expect to do it any justice at all. You are just torturing your material for no good reason, trying to turn \\"Jane Eyre\\" into something it is not.<br /><br />Also, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a *gothic* novel. Gothic tales are supposed to be presented in a manner that is creepy, hair-raising, and over-the-top. There are scenes in \\"Jane Eyre\\" that cry out for expressionist lighting and ominous music - like in the 1944, Orson Welles / Joan Fontain version which, if nothing else, captured Jane's early years as an impoverished orphan, and the gothic atmosphere, very well.<br /><br />Jane Eyre, the book's eponymous heroine, is the reason to read the book. Scenes of the mistreatment of small children by callous exploiters are bearable because righteous and irrepressible Jane is your guide through all the bleakness, misery, and injustice.<br /><br />\\"Jane Eyre\\" 2011 attaches leeches to this little firebrand and attempts to bleed her dry. In the opening scenes of the book, the reader immediately knows that this is one spunky heroine who, fist balled and spine stiff in the face of earthly power, will take the reader for a bumpy but unforgettable ride. Jane fights back. Jane demands respect. Jane stands up to everyone, from a cousin who beats her, to a rich aunt who controls her fate, to a sadistic manager of an orphanage, to her \\"master\\" at her first job. Jane never stops giving lip, standing up, insisting on the worth of one of the most wretched of the earth.<br /><br />\\"Jane Eyre\\" 2011 opens with Jane sobbing and wandering aimlessly and prostrate on a rock. Why did Cary Fukunaga turn vibrant, feisty, colorful Jane Eyre into this limp, gray, pathetic loser? Was the real Jane of the book too much for him?<br /><br />There's one good bit in this botch: Michael Fassbender is an excellent Rochester, one of the very best. Enjoying his performance got me through this film. Mia Wasikowska could have made for a very good Jane, but her performance, like the rest of the film, is drained of passion. It's as if Fukunaga instructed his performers to play every scene as quickly and flatly as possible: \\"Here you are asking her to marry you. Play it as if you are asking her which subway train goes uptown. And remember - you are distracted, not really present, and in a hurry.\\" There's no feeling in anything here, and \\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the most feeling books ever written. It is a deeply passionate book, and this film is as flat as cold as and as dry as the tundra. Tundras have some purpose, though, and I can see none for this film..

B005XQLBU4|4.0|awesome game! Would recommend for most ages and a real time passer. A game you want to just keep playing!
B001P06GX4|5.0|excellent toy. very enhoyable for all ages 6 and up. We play it every night, and everyone enjoys it. its a toy that needs the use of your brains a little, and not just a brainless game like chutes and ladders and candy land!

B000KKPN5C|4.0|I got the SB-400 flash for Christmas. It makes such a difference. I took pictures at a party in a big room (25 m). The people in the very end have enough light. I'm very happy. It is mall and it fits in the camera bag under the lens. It will be nice to turn on automatically. I forgot few times to turn it on and the camera flash popped out and I had to take it of, close the camera flash and put it back on. I would strongly recommend this flash.
B002L6I9Z4|2.0|Purchased this item in summer of 2011 for my 3-year-old.  It worked as expected for about six months. My child was able to take pictures and navigate the pictures on the camera. Very well designed from the ease of use standpoint.  Recently, however, the coloring of the pictures it takes and the display on back is off. Everything has a red tint. My three-year old doesn't mind. As far as we know, the camera was never bumped or dropped. I wish a $50 camera was better made than that.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Item came brand new and quickly. It quickly has become my wife and I's favorite game to play with one another. Thanks!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|fun game but didnt get remotely challenging till level 25.  i wish i could could save the game and restart there instead of back to 1.  I don't think I want to go through all the easy stuff again to get to the good stuff.
B004M9ZI0M|1.0|I am a huge fan of Shakespeare.  I have listened to audio versions of all of the plays and have seen stage productions of more than half of them.  The Tempest is on my favorite plays.  Helen Mirren is one of the greatest actresses of our times and I was excited to hear that she had been cast as Prospera.    It was so promising!  Unfortunately, the actual film is a total disappointment.  This is one of the worst productions of Shakespeare that I have ever seen.    The story is set on an island.  The story offers the perfect opportunity for lush tropical settings.  The producers of this film must have searched high and low for a particularly uninteresting area of coastline.  Visually this film is very dull and unappealing.    I've seen better staging in a theater.  The Tempest is about magic.  The staging of this film is unimaginative.  There is no magic in the production, making the story pointless.    I generally have no problem with Shakespearean language or with British accents.  And yet I had huge issues comprehending what the actors were saying in large sections of the dialog in this film.  Quite a few of them sound like they are mumbling.  Unfortunately, this is the kind of dreary production that turns people off of Shakespeare.  Watching this left me sad and disappointed.
B0061JPYX2|1.0|im sorry but i cannot review this item until it has arrived. i ordered this as a present for someone in cyprus and as far as i am aware it has still not arrived.....it is now the 25 jan and the product STILL HASNT ARRIVED...... please advise asap

These are cute, small and comfortable. I have had mine for a year now and I have had no problems with it yet. The original battery has not died. If you're looking for a fun watch, this is the watch you should purchase.

B002ZG99TA|4.0|After the remake of Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3, it is strange to see Denzel Washington take on another role as a railroad man. But unlike Pelham, there's no crime story here unless you count criminal incompetence. What we do have is an exciting if slight workplace thriller, a mad dash across a mythical Central Pennsylvania after an empty train going full throttle toward a populated area--oh, yeah...It's also filled with dangerous chemicals.  While the film has some nice touches, if seldom rises above a made-for-TV kind of plot. Though a far cry from some of Tony Scott's real turkeys (Domino comes painfully to mind) this director has done better work. But Denzel is always a treat to watch and the chase is exciting, making this film a nice diversion.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|This isn't Homer but that doesn't mean it isn't worth watching. In fact, I watch it every time it's on, darn it. Disclosure -- It has my weakness, Christmas. It also has my queen, Kate Winslet but it also has my joker. No, not Black but Law (the nanny thing). It has my frog waiting to be kissed, Black but also it has my dislike, Cameron Diaz. Actually, Diaz has rarely looked so good as she does here. She should hire the make-up artist. She didn't have her usual red-faced hungover look. This is fluffy fun greatly enhanced by some acting greats, Winslet, Law, Eli Wallach and Rufus Sewell. Diaz hasn't really ever impressed me with her acting while I find Black to be underappreciated. No Oscar nods for School of Rock or King Kong? Travesty. Both the homes Diaz and Winslet live in are truly straight out of a movie. It's really all part of the facade. We'd be disappointed if Diaz owned a 1977 ranch with 1750 sq feet or Winslet owned a flat all of 600 sq ft in London's seedy section. Who'd rent those places as a get away? I did find Law and Diaz to be too pretty people perfect but Winslet and Black work well together. And the side story with Winslet and Wallach is a joy. This is a Christmas romance movie. It's meant to make you feel good. It works.
B00650SSWG|4.0|This was one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in years and I'm pretty critical of them. Not Corny. Solid Acting. Fun cultural references. And they deal with some tough real life issues (not talking about sex/relationship stuff) in a poignant way, without being too depressing. There is, as expected, a lot of sex, but they dealt with those scenes in a tasteful, funny, realistic way. If you enjoy romantic comedies, but have high standards for them, this won't disappoint you.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I don't claim to be a microphone expert, but I am a professional guitarist and musician.  This is the mic I use for any vocals and works just fine for miking my<br />loud amp.  Great overall sound, it feels solid, owned for about 3 years and has been dropped lots and works just great.  If you are in a punk band that plays in a basement,<br />this is better than any mic you are using right now.  Get it, you won't be disappointed

1451648537|4.0|Steve Jobs is a well written and honest biography that does not provide flowery overtones to excuse his bad behavior.  The book while sharing the life of Jobs, shows the history of the personal computer and other technologies.  The idea of CEO is  challenged and expanded by the methods, such as narrow it down to five products, used by Jobs at Apple and Pixar.  Jobs was very black and white.  He thought you create all products well and pay attention to details.  Jobs lived the one side of the philosophy in the computer world of keeping a closed, controlled, and managed system from hardware to software, while the other side believes in open sharing of systems which has allowed for numerous companies creating software and hardware in what we now refer to as Window PCs.  i learned that Jobs was as full of creativity as he was bad behavior.    If you want to have insight into what has built the Apple brand, read this book.  If you want to learn good skills and those traits to avoid in business then read this book.  If you are interested in the history of personal computing this is a must read.  If you want insight to how Jobs changed the music and movie worlds this is a book to read (however, if you want insight into the iphone and its' impact this book has been published in a time that allows little reflection on this topic).  This book is recommended.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it. I mean it gives me something to do when im bored. the games aren't super easy either.

0061150142|1.0|Does Jodi Picoult have a freakin' sense of humor?  Yes, the subject matter is serious and tragic, but REAL families will have light moments even after tragedies in their lives.  I wish I had read the first page and then the last  page of this book and skipped all the life-wasting time I spent on the rest of this ridiculous and meaningless story.  And I get the impression that high school literature classes are making teens read this?  Surely they can find something else that deals with teen suicide than this plodding and endless drivel.

B005VPRETE|5.0|I was so excited to see this new line of \\"girlie\\" Legos at Target!  Why couldn't they have made these when I was a kid?  My daughter had Christmas gift card money and chose to spend most of it on this tree house set.  That tells you something!  Everything appealed to her, from the purple packaging to the girl figures and especially the themes of the sets.  She loves animals and several of these new sets feature animals, plus other fun things like a cafe, beauty shop, convertible, house, etc.    My 7 year old daughter and I spent part of a rainy afternoon making this.  She really enjoyed it.  I like that this is more engaging and gives her a feeling of accomplishment when finished.  They separate the pieces into different bags marked #1 and #2 so you do the one bag first and the other bag second, and aren't overwhelmed with all the pieces at once.  The directions are good, they only show adding 2-3 different kinds of pieces at a time so it's easier to follow along.   I liked having something to do with her that wasn't boring for me  ;)  My daughter is an only child so I am frequently her playmate.  Well I'm 35 so often times I have to feign excitement.  This was fun though!  We BOTH want to get the other sets, ha ha!  These would make a great gift if you have a girl's birthday party to go to.  The prices range from $10 for the smaller sets to $50 for the big ones, so you can choose the one that is right for you.
0143038095|5.0|Couldn't put it down, but so emotionally gut-wrenching, I didn't want to read it more than once (my favs I usually read over and over).  I did love this book - very interesting insight into a different culture and community than what I am familiar with - easily translatable and relatable to anyone.  Loved it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It's easy to spend lot of time on this game.  At first I wasn't very good but once I got the hang of it I really enjoyed it.
0743437497|5.0|I read this book when I was 13, and I read it every five years or so.  By now I can quote parts of it in my sleep.  A masterpiece with really no equal, in my humble opinion.  There are many other books that are as good of a read as this, for sure, but this just about qualfies for its' own genre.  My only disappointment was the movie with Jack Nicholson (one of the best performances of all time) - did not end true to the book.  The book ending was much better.  Had the movie ended like the book, would've been the best movie of all time, too.
0399245030|5.0|Lost and Found is one of my favorites for storytime at our elemntary schools. The simplicity and honest approach make this book endearing.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|the game is very addicting but there are times when I get frustrated with it.  good game :-) now I am just typing words to be able to submit this review :-)haha
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great app! Made it to 34th day on first play. I was expecting it to get harder much faster just like Missile Command but with upgrades and rebuilding the cities the game continued on. Worth the $0.99 if you didn't get it as free app of the day!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game works great and is very polished. The only problem is that I have ran the battery down on my phone today.  Works good on Galaxy Nexus.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I am not a movie reviewer.  There have been many reviews that have let you know all the details of the film already any way.<br /><br />But this is an interesting film.  It shows the inner workings of a major league ball team and the politics involved.<br /><br />Brad Pitt as Billy Beane does a pretty good job.  Although generally I am not a Pitt fan, you kinda feel yourself pulling for him.<br /><br />Would I rent it again?  maybe if I had company or visitors that wanted to watch it.  Would I buy it?  Maybe if it were in the $5 bin at the local megalo-mart.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop is one the best. Apps on the market. I like it because its really awesome when your doing stuff. It is useful when you are far away from hour computer or when your just too lazy to get up. The app is amazing and I recommend it for anyone who has a smartphone or a tablet.
B003ZEQMIC|1.0|Something is very wrong here!  I have received this product from two different venders and have been ripped off both times! Yes, my money was refunded in both instances, but the problem remains.  The problem is that this is meant to be a two-cassette DVD package.  In both orders I received only Disc 2, which was extra features.  Ostensibly, the movie was on Disc one which was not included.  Furthermore, the case is built to contain just one disc so this is more than a coincidental packing error.  It really appears that a common supplier is not paying any attention to what they are doing, nor are the venders.  If someone complains, they get their money back.  Everyone else gets ripped off.  These were my first two attempts ever to buy anything on Amazon.com and the whole experience has been discouraging and disheartening.  I still want the movie, but I don't want to keep beating my head against the wall in a system that is broken and has no handyman to look into it.  Wouldn't it be nice if people took pride in what they do?

B001TODCII|5.0|I wish I could say that the plot of this film is contrived, unrealistic and would never actually happen to anyone in real-life. I really do wish that were the case.  Unfortunately, the opposite is true:  the plotline is about as accurate to what happens as a plotline can possibly be.  It sheds a light on a crisis of growing proportion in the world, yet one that gets all too little exposure:  human trafficking.<br /><br />Bryan (Liam Neeson) is an ex CIA spook whose daughter is ambushed / kidnapped while on a trip to Paris.  Luckily for her (and unluckily for her captors!), his skills give him an unexpected advantage in tracking down the thugs who took her from him.  Bryan takes on the HT network with all the grace of a wrecking ball ramming into a 100 year old building!<br /><br />Kidnapping for ransom is something that tends to only happen to the wealthy.  After all, kidnappers who are after $$ have little incentive to kidnap people who are of a modest financial worth.  Human trafficking, on the other hand, is an entirely different animal.  It can happen to anyone, anytime, as selling the person to a 3rd party is the objective, rather than selling the individual back to their family / friends.<br /><br />For this reason, this movie is a must-see as it sheds a much needed light on an all too frequent egregious practice.  It points out how the culprits operate in preying on \\"soft targets\\" who are far from home.  I can honestly say that viewing this movie could actually save lives in the \\"real\\" world in which we live.
B0053KWDES|5.0|I am thoroughly impressed with the quality and fullness I have been missing out on.   I read that headphone amplifiers don't just exists to make music louder, but improve sound and provide a full, hi-fidelity listening experience. This isn't exactly what I wanted, considering I haven't had an iPod for a while, and I'm stuck with my Motorola Droid. The loudness and sound quality on an Android isn't terrible, but nowhere near what I desire in my music. I bought a decent pair of cans (Sennheiser HD 448) for a great price, but I was still lacking. I purchased this amp, and it arrived fairly quickly (even though I'm in Afghanistan) and within ten minutes of listening to my same songs, on the same device, I was speechless and blown away. My ears were tingling, and my jaw was stuck open. There are four ways to improve sound on the device; a volume knob that also acts as the power switch, goes from 1 to 8 (you will NOT need more than 8) a gain switch that goes from lo-to-hi, and a three-way EQ switch 0,1, and 2. The EQ switch seems to act as a low switch, bass improves with numbers. To add onto all of that, there is a switch that powers up the voltage under the battery, from low to high. I have the switch to high, the gain at hi, and the EQ switch at 1. The volume knob stays at about 5.5, and my cell phone volume sits two clicks below maximum. With these settings, I'm still at about 75% power and volume, and it is STILL louder than I usually used to, but every song sounds pure and excellent. I'm sure with reference headphones and dishing out a few more hundred dollars, I could go higher on the amp, but I don't think I will need to.  I HIGHLY recommend this amp; I would recommend getting any kind of amp really. If you're looking to improve your sound and audio quality, get a good pair of headphones/ear buds. Pay more than $10 people, I don't care how good you THINK they sound, you're missing out. Then, get yourself this amplifier and see what I'm raving about. Oh and the rechargeable battery (by miniUSB) is a great touch.  5/5
0307593312|5.0|Enthralling.  Complex and sometimes confusing--it's best if you let it take you for a ride, and enjoy the scenery.  Multilayered and rich. Highly recommend.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app! there are a variety of devotional plans to choose from; something for everyone. I look forward to reading my devotion and this app has made it easy.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I have tried MANY different timer apps several that I PAID for... most crash (as this did).  The developer immediately provided me with an updated version which DID NOT crash as well as included many new features.  Notable is the ability to easily start preconfigured timers, include autorestart after timer up, etc.  Suggest you give it a try again if it did not work for you the first time.  The price is very affordable.

B000002JQ6|5.0|If you are say a casual fan of ac/dc like me and want one cd to have, this is it.  Live collections of some of there greatest hits all in great sound with the excitement that live cd's provide.  Live cd's in my opinion are best way to experience your favorite musicians/bands.  It can really bring there music to life in a way that studio recordings can't sometimes, but not all the time, just depends.  For the more dedicated fan, the 2 cd live set might be a better option with more songs represented.  Nonetheless, you can't go wrong with either.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its not to bad. they could use a little set up help. otherwise its just a bunch of small games in one app. I'm okay with it.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|My admiration of Sanderson keeps growing, as does my appreciation of his work. The Way of Kings, and the concept behind The Stormlight Archive, is his most original and inspired work yet.   In most fantasy, I find that the world is primarily our world, with significant changes in the form of magic or creatures. Sanderson's work is what made me realize this by stretching the bounds of possibility, going far beyond a setting that is \\"our world, just different,\\" and creating brand new worlds. The Mistborn series started this, with a world that was simultaneously alien and familiar. The Stormlight Archive goes well beyond and successfully creates a world of its own that serves as a character in itself.  For me, the story is driven by three notable characters, one of which is the world itself. I wanted to keep reading because I wanted to learn more about this alien planet with a completely unique environment that acts as a significant force in the novel. After the world itself, my next favorite character was Kaladin, whose mysterious past is slowly and lovingly unraveled throughout the story. Shallin, the third major character, could have stood on her own as the main character, but at the same time, I felt she was overshadowed by Kaladin and the world itself. The sections from Shallin's point of view were compelling half because the way in which her studies gave hints at exposition for the background of this world.   Sanderson's work was already impressive and notable in the genre, but I believe that his Stormlight Archive will cement his legacy beyond just \\"the author who finished Robert Jordan's work.\\"

0446573019|4.0|I enjoyed the book the I guess I was spoiled by the Camel Club books. THe characters seemed very shallow in comparision. The story was good and I did find myself looking for free moments to sneak a few pages. It was a fun read.
1451648537|4.0|I'm always a sucker for books that detail the lives, influences, and demons of those captains of industry that so often capture the public imagination.  Arguably, there may be no better candidate for such a treatment than Steve Jobs, a person who is at once to be remembered for so much creativity but also dying prematurely.  Isaacson's book, obviously, comes on the heels of the Apple co-founders untimely death and it would appear from the very first few pages that Jobs felt that his number was soon to be called.  This may explain the faint sense that the book, while not rushed, doesn't capture its subject as completely as one would hope.<br /><br />While the book is great, there is always a sense of wanting more.  The most pressing desire is to want to have heard more of Jobs himself rather than Isaacson speaking for him.  The front flap boasts that over 40 interviews were conducted in the process of preparing and writing the book, but for all of those conversations, which I'm sure were absolutely fascinating, the reader gets only a brief snippet here and there.  There are a lot of details in the book that I feel only Jobs could have shed more light on.  I appreciate the author's attempt to dissect Jobs in order to reveal his motivations, but it would have been nice to have juxtaposed that next to what Jobs had said.  Indeed this points to the larger phenomenon that you feel that after a certain point in the book, it becomes more about Apple and different products than about Jobs himself.<br /><br />I also feel that the chronology of the book could have been handled better.  This is to say that the conclusion of one chapter might end in, say, 1986 but the next chapter will take you back to 1982.  The timeline is a mess!  The focus on products seems to overshadow the person at times and so those rare chapters that talk about things away from Apple (or Pixar, or NeXT) feel boring, unremarkable, thrown-in and just interrupt the flow more than anything.<br /><br />Isaacson strikes a good balance of being objective about Jobs and being overly sympathetic, perhaps trending a little much on the latter.  I certainly appreciate that the book doesn't feel like a doting piece of hero worship and paints a portrait of Jobs warts and all.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great book.  I imagine that numerous other works will follow it in the years to come but the unparalleled access to Jobs will make this stand out as, perhaps, the most authoritative.  It is well worth the time to read and I highly recommend it, even if Jobs' life may be too much for one lengthy book to contain.
0439023513|4.0|The first two books were hard to put down. I absolutely love them. However, I felt Mockingjay was a little slow at the beginning and it took me until the third section to really get into it.   SPOILER ALERT: I thought it was interesting how Collins portrayed President Coin as evil in the end and how she thought of the hunger games for the Capitol's children. That was really a surprise. I, also, was completely shocked how Katniss killed Coin at the end, which Coin well deserved. That was awesome! Absolutely brilliant!  I was very disappointed Prim died at the very end and I was in tears. I could feel Katniss' deep pain for the loss of her sister, her father, and all her dear friends she lost. I am so happy that Katniss chose Peeta though. It was a very realistic ending to a war directed book. I feel sad, but satisfied.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book is one of the best books  i have ever read.... along with  the hunger games and cathing fire. this amazing action packed trilogy will delight you whoever yu are.

B006OFN0SE|1.0|Totally miscast, script was disjointed and very liberal with truth of actual events. Movies like this drive me back to books where I can recieve some semblance of truth and not Hollywoods interpretation of what is proported to be the depiction of historical events. Not the first time Eastwood interjects his personal theories as what is what when it comes to the historical record.
055357342X|3.0|While this series started off really well (although the cold northern castle and all the heavy furs are a little clichéd), I think at this point, the saga is starting to resemble one of those 77 course wedding feasts - great to start off with but after a dozen or so courses, you start to feel a bit bloated and your attention begins to wander.   While Martin's narrative voice is very readable and his imagination is undoubtedly good, I think the scope of the work is exceeding his story development and character skills. The story is told from too many POVs - most characters aren't developed enough so you don't really care about them, while the few interesting ones are whisked away just as you start to enjoy them. And there's too much happening but a lot of it is frankly quite boring -Arya moves around a lot but she doesn't really seem to be getting anywhere.  Unfortunately given the reviews of books 5 and 6, I don't think it's going to get any better - which is a real shame, because had he had a better editor at this point, Martin's hard work might have just have delivered a bang of a series rather than the extended whimper it's sadly turning into.  BTW I'd recommend Julian May's Saga of the Exiles as an example of how to do a multi-character saga brilliantly.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my mother. My father bought the actual Kindle Fire so it was the perfect accessory. It was definitely needed. The case is light weight and thin. It is very convenient. I would recommend this case for anyone who already has a Kindle Fire.  Also, Amazon sent it very quickly and it was in perfect shape. I have no complaints whatsoever.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game!!  Graphics are ok but gets more challenging with each level completed!! Touch screen controls are pretty accurate!! The further in the game you get the quicker you have to be!!
1451627289|3.0|The world, and Amazon, does not need another King review.  But nevertheless, here goes: I think this novel is more tightly plotted than so, so many he has put out in the last several decades. (What editor is going to turn to him and say,\\"Good, Stephen! Now lose half the rambling and we'll have something!\\" ...to the highest paid author around?) This book may be more tightly plotted with less wasted space since the early Salem's Lot. And, still, it has its self-indulgent moments that could have been excised. But it might be forgiven in that the author is obviously taking us back to a time when, at least in his mind, America was more wide-eyed and willing to believe that goodness was at the heart of what we are about, rather than being just one-more nation-state on its way to the future. Rightly or wrongly, King is obviously indulging in nostalgia even when he makes sure he is pointing out the open wounds of America of that age when there was less assurance of 'civil rights' or duties being upheld. It is a very hard balancing act to revel in a mostly good time, while at the same time acknowledging that there were bad things there, too. And, his main character is commenting on the times from the standpoint of a driven individual who is trying not to lose sight of his goal, rather than make social commentary. So, pretty good, overall.  Not horror. This is sci-fi. And fairly deftly handled in that he is not exploring this story as time travel, but as a romance with the character and with the times. It is not till the end of the novel that a jarring Deus Ex Machina in the character of a watcher gets in the way of nice plotting. The conclusions the main character derives that come out of this interaction could have been arrived at differently without such a jarring character that has no tie-in, tie-up, or even apparent motivation. He is a big hanging mystery we are just supposed to accept. Took me right out of the suspending disbelief mode.  The unsettling part of reading King in the past decade is the recycling of characters over the years.  I.E. All people who show up in his novels who have a smidgeon of (Christian) faith, or are church-going, are Mrs. Grundy-ites that are judgmental, too nosy, and live to wag their finger in your face with self-important righteousness. All people that sing the National Anthem and feel love and emotion about their country are dunder-heads that have trouble tying their shoes without instructions. All military people are out to destroy the world in the next war.  And...sub-text, usually...all those who lean a bit more on the conservative side of an issue, particularly politicians, are b**tard pre-conversion Scrooges that are in it for themselves and to screw the poor and destitute - meaning everyone else who, naturally, think rightly. And, while a concrete concept of writing is to write what you know, the number of main characters that are writers (in this case an english teacher taking a stab at it) gets to be a bit much. This side of his creative mind is always stuck in a 60s,70s loop. He needs to update that part of his creativity.  For this reason I have not given it the highest-star-praise.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that there is any translation you could want, with notes and translation helps. You can also copy and paste into a text or email and it will set you up on a \\"read the Bible in a year\\" plan. It will let you set up your reminder and has your daily reading set aside for you. No searching through 15 books....no excuses!! You can highlight, make notes, and some translations will actually text to speech....so you can plug in your phone while you drive and the Bible will be read to you!!! LOVE this app!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app-so User friendly &amp; easier to access chapters &amp; verses. Only drawback is inability to download when wifi is absent. I have really missed it while on 2-wk cruise when I had to use a clunkier downloaded app.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|The Good, The Bad, and the Vision! Excellent Author, Monumental Subject = one GREAT read. Whether you liked him or not, there is a certain insight revealed in these pages that rival the greatest of the greats. He was unique, yet his accomplishments have been compared to the likes of Leonardo da Vinci, Edison and Ford. I was once asked, because of my musical background, whether or not any musicians today rival the likes of Beethoven. In my estimation, no! There are amazing composer/performers alive today, but, like Jobs, there was only one Beethoven.

B005XQLBU4|3.0|Test devices:<br />Samsung Epic, Android 2.3 official<br />Viewsonic gTablet, FrankenTab (Android 2.2)<br /><br />Being a big fan of Missile Command, I had a lot of hope for Missile Defender.  But, it just wasn't all that great.  Sure, the addition of upgrades was kinda cool, but the rest was pretty blah.  HD graphics?  I found them pretty simplistic and dull.  The same with the sound effects and lack of soundtrack.  Perhaps I'm spoiled with the likes of [[ASIN:B005023UTG Warheads]], which offers excellent graphics, online leaderboards, and more.
0439023521|5.0|I started reading this book after seeing the trailer for the movie.  I was so impressed I bought the other 2 in the series before I was halfway through this first one.  Now I'm half through the second and am still impressed!  I'm usually not one to read YA aimed books (the Harry Potter series and the Hunger Games series seem to be the exceptions).  The characters draw you in and to be honest you feel like you're part of the story and I couldn't put it down.  I may have to read it again before the film release just because.....
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|I know no one really buys CDs anymore, but I still love them!  I love even more that this is an album worth listening to over and over.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|If you like the original, then this is a no brainer.  If you are new to Quell, I would get the original first because going from this back to the original would feel like a small step backwards. This adds movable spikes, multiple water drops and a new \\"red blob\\" hazard. A downside with the original is that I flew through the lower levels and they didn't get challenging until about the 6th \\"shelf\\".  This one increases in difficulty at around the 4th shelf (partially due to the new additions mentioned above), so it appears there will be a little more longevity with this one for me.  Definitely worth a buck!

1451627289|5.0|I just finished 11/22 and have to recommend it, especially if you are not normally a King fan. I hate horror books (i am such a wuss i get nightmares easily). But Stephen King's superior writing style, imagination, diction, imagery, characters, and ability to weave rich and intricate detail into his stories always has me on the prowl for one of his non horror books (if you're like this, also check out Eyes of the Dragon, another of my fave King novels). This one was fabulous and i devoured it in a few days. Fantastic read. Loved the allusion to harmonizing which refers to another of his stories ;-)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Love the games and how easy it is to get points. Best part is you can choose which games you want to purchase. It's also great that you can earn your points through thing as simple as playing the game and making a review like this. I love love love it!

B001NEK2GE|5.0|There is finally a good replacement for the G-15 keyboard that held up well for a lot of hard use.    I would rate it excellent in all aspects.  Slightly smaller than the G-15 a few things are slightly   different but are as good as the beloved G-15.  Took no time to get used to.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app. It has a lot of translations and numerous plans to follow to read the Bible. You can read at your leisure, follow a well mapped out plan, or read plans for a certain topic. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the app won't work if my Kindle is out of WiFi range.
B00499K9E0|2.0|Sherlock: A Study in Pink, 2011 film<br /><br />The \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" stories are classic mystery stories that record the society of the late 19th and early 20th century Great Britain. Setting the stories in modern times can make them seem more realistic and avoids the problem of creating an old background. But culture and laws are different from the last century. This story is based on \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" but without the chapters spent in 19th century America that provide the background and motive. You should know the original for comparison. [I think Doyle's stories about America were a form of propaganda to prevent emigration from Britain (as in \\"The Valley of Fear\\").]<br /><br />The faults in this drama result from copying some features from the original and creating new ones. \\"What is good is not new, what is new is not good.\\" It seems too intense in the beginning, and too slow-paced at the end. This version of SH seems overly nervous and high-strung compared to the original. Was this version of Watson \\"dumbed-down\\" for comedy? Using nicotine patches is a cute idea, but some say nicotine gum is better. There was no \\"gun control\\" before the Great War, unlike modern times. Council Housing and the Labor Party eliminated most of the Victorian slum housing, and there were other changes.<br /><br />The murders committed here seem senseless (without the prior events in America). There were plenty of murders and other crimes that required expertise to solve them. Most murders are caused by love or money, to get it or to keep it. There is usually a personal involvement that caused it. Murders by serial killers, or organized crime, are harder to solve since there is usually no prior involvement between the victim and the killer. This story seems ridiculous in having a murderer commit crimes during his working hours! I don't think that is probable. The story also makes jokes about the original characters. Writers who copy the SH stories do not have enough talent to create their own characters, and never will. Copying the original prevents them from creating a better story. I think admirers of the original won't like it, and others won't become fans of this series. There will be a few exceptions. Writers who copy the original stories are seldom talented enough to match the original. The ending seems wrong; would a medical doctor deliberately kill an unarmed man? [I suspect both pills were poison, the killer would only pretend to take his pill.]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game ! it is great for when you are trying to waste time ! its great .
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I absolutely love her, this concert makes you feel you are really there. She is so connected to the audience and you felt the emotion in every song. Highly recommend this, very entertaining.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded it for my Kindle Fire and I love it! Always been a fan but this version is great! Clicking on the card rather than dragging it is a bit lazy...but I love it! ;-)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy the multiple mini games this app provides though I wish the advertisements wrere less intrusive to the experience.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A surprisingly excellent reproduction (and update) of the old console game. Great work guys! Now to see what else you've coded...
B000002U9L|5.0|Love this CD! The Labyrinth is one of my favorite movies. I used to watch it with my little sister and now I watch it with my daughter. The sound track is great. The price was super cheap and I recieved it quickly.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this app is great. the fact that you have to unlock all the games makes this app more fun and challenging
B0068RHGJM|5.0|I just listened to this album all week after buying it the day it came out...and i was not disappointed one bit. I was a little worried that their music was going to change for the worse like Lacuna Coil and I loved Unleashed Memories/Comalies/Karmacode by them.But this Nightwish album rocked!!It was so worth the wait and it is easily my favorite now.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|This came quicker than I expected, so that was a definite plus. It was factory sealed and was perfect for the gift that my husband wanted...so glad they had this!!!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great variety of games. Good for hours of entertainment, graphics are very realistic. Games are not easy nor extremely difficult which challenges the competativeness inside us all.
B0058VW36U|5.0|i definitely had some fun playing n have no prob. going back to previous lvls, even without the upgrade ever1 wants
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun game brings back the memories of low res 80s arcade games.  some more variety in targwts would add to the fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a good game it needs a bunch of upgrade to make the game harder to beat it is a good game for car. rides to
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game but takes a while to unlock new games. must download.other takes to get all 101
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is terribly addicting! I often get caught up in it and forget about time. the only annoying thing is all the ads.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Missile upgrades make this better than most missile defense games I have played. Building repair option great as well. Nicely done.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This was considered the best Christmas gift my daughter received.  She already owns the original movies on VHS and DVD. With the changes in viewing quality on today's televisions it's nice to see the movies in better quality.
B006O5Y0SS|2.0|The concept was a novel idea as I can relate being in love with the WWII era here in the states in contrast to Gil's (Owen Daniel)fascination with the 1920's in Paris, France; however, there was no substantial development in the psyche and desire for this infatuation. It was not believable, mainly due to a poor performance by Owen who should stick to the more traditional comedies and by the way this was at no point a comedy and should not be regarded as such.  If another actor pick any in lieu of Owen would have been chosen for this role the movie would stand a better chance.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|always on this. its addicting and fun. especially since there is multiple levels and games. some are hard but I just have my husband play those haha
B0057ZAA0S|5.0|Great funny movie that the plot keeps going.  I can see it several times, but now on Bluray, the quality is superb!
B0063IH60K|3.0|This game is just ok. it actually lets me win too often.<br />I wish it was more challenging but it's a good time killer
1250004217|1.0|I cannot believe this book was even close to a bestseller. Let me begin first by listing the positive qualities, of which there are 2:  1. it deals with a sensitive topic, and made a valiant attempt in bringing Holocaust horror (and perhaps human brutality more generally) to life  2. it is written in large font, and the pages smelled nice.  These and only these, are the book's redeeming qualities.  There is little to commend about a book that is practically a parody of how to write by 'showing' rather than 'telling'. The 290 pages of nonsense were practically an outline of a few major events in an American-born French woman's life, all of which can be summarized as follows: She got married, her French husband was despicable, she got divorced, she learned about the Holocaust. The additional text neither added any additional information, nor did anything to bring those events to life. The characters were practical caricatures of themselves, their actions were hard to stomach or believe, the story itself resembled an 8th grader's attempt at writing her first novel.  The author's writing is strongest when discussing Sarah's story, and perhaps the author should have stuck there. When it comes to discussing Julia Jarmond, however, I got the sense I was reading an 8th grader's first attempt at writing a novel. The book has the feel of a narrator that is writing on topics she doesn't fully understand: marriage, infidelity, abortion, resorting to a series of repetitive cliches (on marriage: it's hard; on infidelity: it's bad; on abortion: it's bad). I failed to see what could possibly be gained here.  Here's another thought -- if you plan on writing a story about a character so spineless that she never once stands up to her cheating, narcissistic, chauvinistic husband, please please at least give him a few good lines. Again, I can't fathom what the critics thought was the least bit redeemable about Julia Jarmond's tale.  I would recommend this to an 8th grade classroom, as part of a lesson on how not to write.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun games, addicting once you start playing them. Just download it already and find out what you are missing, just do it!
0316044938|4.0|The narration is so light and easy, I almost wouldn't have expected to get such a powerful story to come of it.  How clever to use a fantastical, other-wordly narrative voice to paint such a realistic picture of 'horror on earth'.  Given the content, the book could've easily veered off into a series of cliches about how evil must be punished, how the deceased are carried on in our memories, how true sorrow brings people together. But the book so seamlessly and cleverly avoids all of these. Instead, Sebold lets the characters be real people, make their mistakes, act kindly, meanly, appropriately, and inappropriately. And instead of a sappy, 'tie it all together' conclusion, the reader was left much like I imagine Susie's family was at the book's end: part at peace in their sorrow, part sorrowful knowing they will never be at peace.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is good for the beginner as well as middle level game players. started off slow enough to learn but advanced quickly
B005XQLBU4|5.0|middle defender has clean graphics. and the game gamen play progresses quickly.  I also like the fact that you can choose which buildings to upgrade and can upgrade missiles based on speed and duration of explosion.  I got this for free but definitely worth paying for.  works great on kindle fire, not sure about other systems.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|It was a partly cloudy late Thursday afternoon of the first week of June in 1967. I remember it now like it was yesterday. I was over at a friends house and his sister was holding a high school sorority meeting that had just ended.While standing in the middle of the driveway where most of the beautiful high school girls had congregated. I  heard one of the the teenage girls say &#34;has anyone heard the new Beatles album?&#34;Being I had a huge ardent predilection for the Beatles  at the time, the question immediately allured me.Although everyone in ear of the question had acknowledge they hadn't,I was immediately intoxicated with curiosity.For it was just eight months earlier, it had been publicly announced that the Beatles would no longer be touring,which had left me feeling despondent in regards of ever hearing anything musical from them again.Therefore unhesitatingly, I eagerly went up to the teenage girl who had asked the question and proceeded to ask her what the the album was like.In a contemplative tone while maintaining her feminine demeanor she replied reflectively &#34;it's really hard to describe&#34;.In an attempt to try to get her to expound on her answer,I asked her, if it was anything like their lp revolver?Shaking her head slowly she said no.I said is it anything like rubber soul?She said no. Then she added parenthetically &#34;it's like nothing they've ever done or I've ever heard before&#34;.This only impelled me to explore more of what she had experienced.Therefore,still determined in a gesture of supplication, I asked her what the record was called.She kindly replied &#34;Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band&#34;. I was immediately taken by surprise,for the title sounded so mysterious and hieroglyphic to me. I then proceeded to ask what the songs were like.Without further hesitation she replied  &#34; there all really different, none of songs are like anything they've written before&#34;. In a musing tone she added &#34;there's this one song in particular called, A Day In The Life&#34;while pausing for a moment then elaborating  &#34;it's very melancholy&#34; she stated philosophically.<br />It's then she had to go and there I was left with these hints of the new Beatles album.<br />Dwelling emphatically on what had just transpired. I thought to myself,what kind of title for a song is A Day In The Life? I'd never heard of the word melancholy before-and what kind of name for an album is Sgt.Peppers Lonely Heart Club Band?<br />It wasn't until that weekend,while I was in the city with a friend that we found ourselves in front of a record shop.There it was in the display window, the new Beatles  lp Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br />There it was,a cover of the likes I'd never seen.The photograph luminously comprised of the Beatles in colorful uniforms with a group of wax figures gathered around them. I was  immediately transfixed  by the elaborate symmetry in which all the figures,flowers and the Beatles were arranged.There was an extraordinary rich profusion  of bright colors,that only lent enchantment to the view. An album cover that only seemed to elicit  a universal symbolic expression of artistic nonjudgemental kindness,mpeace and goodwill.<br />All this illuminated,in the backdrop of a stultifying world made up of black and white tv,a world painted in somber colors, where everything was closed on Sundays and the Vietnam war continued to escalate.<br />Since the lp had no single to promote the record and since it-received no radio air play,no concert promotion and absolutely no advertising what so ever.The only way to hear it and to know what was inside,was to buy it.<br />Therefore a couple days later I was able to gather  $2.75 which at that time was a great deal of money and went and purchased the original mono copy of the album.As soon as I bought it,I hurried home and opened the record and their in the gatefold was a colorful picture of the Beatles in their band uniforms. As I continued to inspect it closely, there inside was a cardboard cutout of souvenir pop art design  and the sleeve  the record was held in was of a very orange like dream like nature. Immediately, I put the record on the turntable and from that moment on,I was transported into a musical journey of inexpressible wonder and enjoyment. It musically stood out like no other record I'd ever heard,and on top of everything else, it was incomparable to anything they'd ever done and anything that had ever been recorded in popular music. It was clear that all the songs were carefully sedulously composed.<br />I remember at one point while listening to the mesmeric haunting melody of a day in the life, being so emotionally moved. The lp was able to emotionally get you high from just listening to the music.<br />It wasn't long before word got out in the neighborhood I lived in that I had the album.<br />Immediately all my friends sisters wanted to barrow it.The  music from the lp, seemed to fill the atmosphere.<br />In addition, it was the same month that the international Monterey pop festival took place which filled the summer atmosphere  with interminable  positive musical energy.<br />Since it was the beginning of the summer and school was out I had a couple of months to listen to  the record every day for hours. I'm not a exaggerating when I say it took months to get acquainted with the personality of the record.<br />I wasn't aware of it then but the year of 1967 was without  a doubt one most exciting and creative years in popular music. At the time, I thought all the goodwill,good intentions and kindness would last forever. But it was not to be. Everyone's ego took over and the whole thing went down the toilet (see Crosby Stills Nash and Young).<br />Through the years many sleazy unprofessional  magazines like mojo,rolling stone,Q ect and there littering incompetent journalists continue to try to label and exploit that summer with insulting statements like calling it the summer of love,psychedelic music etc. But at the time it had no name, it was just a year in which many artists had spent years developing their craft and together had reached a summit.The energy of the music at that time permeated through the culture. But not everyone was attune to it.As David Crosby said at the time (this is when he had half a brain) that if everybody at the time was listening to Sergeant peppers lonely hearts club band it could have ended the Vietnam War. I too believed it then ,as I do now.<br />That year saw the releases of Album 1700 (Peter Paul and Mary),Goodbye Hello(Tim Buckley)Insight, out(The Association) Seen In Green(The Seekers) A Gift To A Flower From A Garden (Donovan),Of Cabbages And Kings (Chad Stuart and Jeremy Clyde),Wildflowers (Judy Collins),Evolution (Hollies),Their Satanic Majesties Request(The Original Rolling Stones),The Graduate Sound Track (Simon and Garfunkel) Pices Aquarius Jones Limited (The Monkees) By The Time I Get To Phoenix (Glen Campbell) Younger Than Yesterday(The Byrds)<br />Once Upon A Dream(The Rascals).<br />What more can I say.<br />Highly recommend!
1430233834|3.0|It's a good book if you are a beginner, but not very usefull for advanced users.<br /><br />Tons of pages just treat convencional html and css. HTML5 is covered a long after.<br /><br />The game development aspect are not covered. It's only used to demonstrate some things. The main aspects of game development as main loop and threads are just superficial.<br /><br />The code are very organized however. The book try harder to make the experience easy.<br /><br />Have this in mind if you want to buy this one.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This was a fun game. Very challenging the further along you go. The game got stuck twice during play, but quickly resumed on my Evo.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|many of the games are pointless and uninteresting and others are decent but could be a lot better. definitely addicting though I like the idea that ill find a better game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun to play when you just want something to do for a brief period of time.  A nice diversity of games on it.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|It is awesome if you bye it you won't want to return it. Get it the movie is awesome. Me and my family watched it and loved it.
1593157134|5.0|This book is a must read. If you need direction, motivation and change in your life then you need this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really great and when I play it I am always entertained.  I am always playing this game!
B004SDEP38|4.0|This app is definitely faster and more feature packed than Android. Used on Verizon razr. Older phones may have trouble.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|awesome ap. I can make notes on my android phone and transfer to my kindle since its an account based program. I can put pictures and to do lists even links to web pages. suck the teet of technology with evernote!!!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game, keeps you interested and keeps you on your toes! Good challenge and upgrades! Simple graphics are still very nice to look at!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Love this game and play it all the time but I just wish that it was more like the iPod version in the next update. More swords and backgrounds and more fruit like the iOS version.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Playability is great.  Lots of options. Highly recommended! Would be even better if it had several other solitaire versions to play.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|setting it up like this, getting points for games to unlock others, makes the game almost addictive.  although... some of the games are hard, or just stupid.  after having enough points you have to choose the next game with care.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is lots of fun. It keeps me entertained when I'm bored. I would suggest this to friends I guess
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Not too hard not too easy. Reccomend u get this game. All of these games have there own unique game style. And its freeee.Try it.
B002JMLMKE|5.0|I bought this for my nephew and I read it.  I like reading the books more than seeing the movie.
1451648537|5.0|I got this quite close to Christmas, for my daughter.  Shipping was v-e-r-y fast, and it arrived in plenty of time for Christmas and to keep me calm.  She loves the book and is very happy with it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app is okay. I don't like how you have to unlock every game though. it's kind of stupid
B00005PJ8O|1.0|Received the DVD after about a week, and the quality of the DVD was absolutely terrible. There was something sticky all over the disk, and the surface area of the DVD itself was all nicked up and smeared with something also.
B005QUQRE2|5.0|The intriguing premise drew me in. There are no well known actors (except maybe for the guy who played Ethan in Lost), but the acting is excellent. It's very believable and understated. Although it is science fiction, the primary focus is on the characters and the relationships. I would call it lite science fiction, however the SF backdrop is crucial to the story and the ending, despite the reviewer who said you could remove it w/o any effect.   Excellent story and acting, and also thought provoking.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Clint gives an awesome performance. It is obvious that time has just made him a better actor. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a Clint Eastwood fan, or anyone who enjoys a good story line. My wife is not a big Clint Eastwood fan and even she loved this movie.
1592289444|5.0|An excellent book about the escape and subsequent persistence of the human spirit determined to escape torture, slavery of a sorts and eventual death at the hands of the Russians during World War II.  If you have read all the survival fiction then read the realities of these true story people who really have no survival training, yet survive anyway.  You begin to see that survival is matter of the mind, heart and soul.  I recommend this book to any who feel like they might like to know more about the heart, soul, guts and persistence of true survival...  Regards, Dan
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I was almost more excited to receive this item than the actual Kindle Fire!! I love the color options (pink is my fave!) and the case adds a layer of protection to your Fire without adding bulk. The feel of the case is amazing. Love it! The only complaint I have is that the flap that covers the front of the kindle looks like it would be sturdier in the picture and in the video, but it's actually very lightweight and is felted on the side that touches the screen to prevent scratches. Still Nice!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Wish you didn't have to play the easier, slow, levels. Unfortunately it's a bit Addicting!! My fingers are tired. Nice job!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I am very please with the DVD series I received. I didn't see any scratches and they all played well. Thanks!!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Who would have thought ten years ago there would be an ensemble action film with Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and John Malkovich?  Throw in Brian Cox and Richard Dreyfuss, and that is an absolute murderer's row of acting.  And it's just as good as expected.<br /><br />The four main stars are RED, Retired Extremely Dangerous, ex-agents who are no longer predators but prey.  Or so the government and its lead agent (Karl Urban) think.  Willis leads the way like it's another installment of Die Hard, bringing along friends who he thought would make the movie-making experience enjoyable.  The professionalism, action, and comedy quickly creates familiarity and there isn't a dull point in the entire film.  To be quite honest, it's plays like the globe-trotting 20th sequel to Ocean's Eleven decades in the future.  Except in this version, Willis plays a better front-man than Clooney and Mirren is absolutely jaw-dropping in her ruthless portrayal as a wet-works expert.  The Freeman-Malkovich combo is collectively hilarious, with Freeman's easy playfulness and Malkovich's insane, paranoia providing a perfect complement to the rather straight-laced Willis spy games.<br /><br />Great movie from beginning to end, literally every base is covered and enjoyable.  The action (car chases/crashes, guns and rockets, a few throat chops) is thrilling, the attempts at comedy are funny, and the drama is heartfelt and relatable.
B00004TS0E|5.0|This movie is heart warming and romantic! A fun family night movie, add the popcorn and Christmas tree limits for atmosphere and you've got a winner of an evening!

B0015DROBO|1.0|This book, ive heard \\"oh it was the best book ever I just loved it!\\" So I decided to pick it up at the library and since the very first page I was bored with it. Didn't understand it and I forced myself to read at least 30 pages, that was the worst hour of my life.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|gr8 atari missle command deluxe  ....  it's the bomb! !!  LOL :-D  Great graphics nice play with various upgrade options that affect play.  Now lets make a game that promotes PEACE MORALITY AND CARING.  I dare you, Jeff Bezos.  Lawson 4 Congress 2012.  Vote Independent! !!!  ....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Me gusta mucho. Es una excelente herramienta de estudio y facil de usar. La facilidad de poder leer  diferentes versiones y diversidad en temas de ayuda es extraordinaria!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun and very enjoyable. It seemed slow at first but don't let it fool you. Quick thinking required once you get past the first week.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I just love this ne cover I purchased, not only is it a very nice case but it is very good leather...You would be very pleased with this case is purchased.
B001FB4VZS|4.0|bought it as a christmas gift and the recepitant seems to like it very well.was shipped quickly and as advertised.
0525478817|5.0|John Green will make you ball your eyes out. One of the top five novels currently in existence. A beautiful piece that does not make you crave more. This novel creates a special place in your heart for itself.
0446582778|4.0|Angels Flight is a very captivating read;  however,  Connelly (even this  early on in the Harry Bosch series) becomes obsessed with politics in the   LAPD -- perhaps too much so.  Too many of the 'bad people' are not-so-neatly  disposed (too easily killed off) of once they are exposed!  An Internet pedo-  phile group is 'found out,' but there is no real follow up to dismantle their  organization ... because the chief perpetrator is eliminated by his wife,  so  their are many loose ends that are left dangling in this book.
B002T9H2L0|3.0|The DVD arrived with a Digital Copy as advertised, but missing the insert with the activation code.  Without the code you can't make a digital copy.  I returned the discs and received a replacement, but that too was missing the insert!  I just spoke to Amazon customer service and was informed that the digital copy capability expired in 2010.  That would have been nice to know before I purchased the DVD!  But there is no indication of this on the product page which still advertises a 2 disc special edition!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game brings me back quite a few years to the Windows 98 days, but its a great game! this app works perfect for my G2

0307887960|5.0|This is the help I have long waited for! In just under 2 weeks of following this plan of diet and excercise I have lost 10 lbs. I was 30-35 lbs overweight and I am about to turn 56 years old and I am a female with large bones and 5'1\\" in height. I realize that it will probably be 3-4 months before I get down to my target weight and this new way of eating and exercise will be for the rest of my life and I am so excited!!
B004EPYZQ2|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie, but it was so filled with countless plot holes and so badly written, that the group of us watching were falling off our chairs by the end with laughter.  It played like a frantic fever dream, jumping from one non-nonsensical scene to another.  By the end, we were rooting for the army to destroy the evil alien who killed countless innocent people, destroyed a town, and left an entire community broken.  In the end, it flies away, powered by the locket that the main characters mother's gave him.  Who knew an intergalactic spaceship could be powered by schmaltz.    There were many scenes that were introduced that did nothing to advance the story or deepen the understanding of the characters.  The mother's death by a steam beam did not impact the story or really the main character.  You really felt nothing for the child, because that emotional pain was not connected with the story.  The conflict with the father and the drunk man responsible for his wife's death was also meaningless.  Why spend a scene on that?    Here are a couple of items for thought:  1. The Air Force does not actually have any airplanes or helicopters.  Instead, the air force has to run to the scene of the train crash.  2. Why did the alien have to dig all those tunnels when the entire town was built around a mine?  3. What did the alien need with all those people that it was kidnapping?  Was it going to eat them?  4. The townspeople had no knowledge of the alien.  If the alien had a physic connection with the people, why did it senselessly kill so many innocent people?  By the end, it was a blood bath!  5. Why does the Air Force have so many tanks, and why were they randomly blowing up the town?  This is another example of where a scene was filmed and then had to be explained away to justify the inclusion of such scene.    6. At the end, cars, tanks, bicycles (anything metallic) are all flying towards the ship.  Then, amazingly, here comes the dad driving in his Jeepwhich is totally unaffected.  Also unaffected was the child with all those METAL braces?  Why wasn't he pulled into the ship and killed?    7. Why was the conflict over the girl suddenly introduced?  In came from nowhere.  8. If keeping the alien's existence was so important, why did the Air Force allow the children to constantly film them?    These are only a few points.  Unfortunately, the writing was so lazy that it ruined what could have been a good film.  I would NOT recommend this as a buy.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|Very much as described, this Kindle Fire cover does a pretty good job of protecting the device. It's a little pricey for what you get, but seems to be competitively positioned - at least for the time being. Positives: easy installation, firm fit, protects from drops, several color options, costs less than leather versions. Negatives: the strap that holds the cover in place works loses its elasticity with use, and the stand feature doesn't work very well. Overall, not a bad choice to protect your new toy.
1594202842|5.0|A few points...   (1) I agree with those who see the book as Chua's personal story, and I disagree with those who say that she is disseminating a message that her way of parenting is the best.  She openly admits that she had shortcomings, and also concedes that trade-offs, mutual agreement, and coaxing sometimes did the trick better than the iron fist.    (2) I think it's also important to view her \\"Chinese mothering\\" in the context of her own childhood.  Chua's parents raised her and her sisters in the same way, and as an adult, she came to be grateful for it.  Ultimately, she feels that their method worked, and that is why she is so adamant to use it herself.  I also had strict parents (not as strict as Chua), and feel an enormous sense of gratitude that I am not afraid of hard work and that I know my own abilities.  I am also extremely close to my parents despite having been barred from many opportunities to hang out with friends, etc.  (3) Despite what I've said about understanding Chua's situation, I can still see why readers are polarized between loving the book and hating it.  But at the end of the day, almost everyone who has read the book has to admit that they finished it cover to cover and that it successfully elicited some kind of strong emotion -- whether that emotion is respect, awe, sympathy, hatred or disgust!  In some ways, I think that alone could be the mark of a well-written book.
B00008IHN1|5.0|My son just began playing percussion in school so we ordered him this movie for Christmas. My husband & I both liked it when we saw it when it came out and we thought he'd enjoy it when he started playing percussion. He enjoyed the movie. We received the movie a few days before the estimated delivery date! Great buying experience.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a really good remix of that classic city defence game. The touchscreen controls really fit well with this kind of game. Its really fun to play, and I got to night 32 on my first try. Was doing nothing but rebuild after each night at that point.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not bad...wish there were more word games,  or just more intelligent games period. some of these could be played by monkeys.
0810983915|3.0|This was shipped quickly and was in god condition. Only thing was that there was writing on the front inside cover, not a big deal for a used book :) Price was great!
B005DQBQ3Q|5.0|The CD arrived just as predicted. The jewel case was cracked but the CD was perfect. Chalk that up to the postal service :) I really enjoy the CD daily.

B004P98QZ8|4.0|This Ninjago lego set is awesome once it is built.  My 10 year old boy is loving it.  I definitely wouldn't buy it for anyone younger than 9 or 10 though.  It was really intense to build.  It was every bit as cool as he was hoping it would be though which sometimes these things disappoint.  He definitely wasn't disappointed with the final product.
B00393SFU2|5.0|M is an extremely impressive movie...but very difficult to review.  Part of what is so compelling about this early talkie from 1931 is how MODERN much of it feels.  And is it really fair to give a movie points for simply surprising the viewer with how similar the plot feels to serial killer movies of today?  However one might come down on that subject, I can't deny that this is a fascinating experience...made truly memorably by Peter Lorre's spectacular (and spectacularly over-the-top) performance as a psychopath before that genre was even remotely familiar.  He had no prior performances to draw from or reference.    Lorre plays the normal (okay, slightly odd, but mostly normal) neighbor who \\"kept to himself...I never saw this coming.\\"  He is a killer of children.  He lures them on the streets with bon-bons or balloons and then they disappear...until their corpses are found later.  Although the film never explicitly mentions sexual abuse...it is deeply implied.    M spends much of its time focusing on the investigation into these serial killings.  We literally have law-enforcement authorities talking to each other on the phone and detailing all the efforts they are making.  It's fascinating, because in the days LONG before computers or any tech gadgetry...these policemen undertake a painstaking and organized search for evidence throughout their German city.  What they lack in whiz-bang technology, they make up for in sheer numbers, determination and German precision.  And they REALLY put the squeeze on the criminal element of the city.  And this has a fascinating result of galvanizing the BAD guys into looking for this killer as well.  Not from altruism, but self-preservation.  This big search for a child killer is putting a damper on their business.    So M is a serial killer movie, but truthfully most of it is more like a police procedural.  There are some pretty intense scenes as they get closer to their quarry...for such seemingly formal and dry material, the brilliant director Fritz Lang conjures up some real tension.  And when we do get to spend time with Lorre and the demons that plaque him begin to surface...well, the film becomes downright creepy.  Lorre throws himself into his role and his gigantic monologue is a bit overdone (it's more suited for stage than screen...but this was such a problem in those days), but it is also riveting and truly memorable.  I think the best way I can articulate my thoughts about the film is to say that it really wasn't much like I expected it to be...it was better.  Lang is a master of mood and lighting.  Lorre is a perfect match of actor to role.  And both the psychology of the killer and the form of the police work make a great deal of sense.  You won't find yourself rolling your eyes at the primitiveness of it all...you'll be drawn in by much of the logic.  Not to say it's perfect...but it probably has no more holes than a typical episode of LAW AND ORDER.  I also felt the film was well paced, and even had a sly sense of humor at times.  I watched the Criterion Blu-ray and it was excellent.  The black and white was gorgeous.  You'll note that many scenes lose their sound altogether.  Apparently, this was on purpose...so don't blame Criterion; blame Lang for a convention that feels odd.  Subtitles were sometimes hard to read.  I've seen several Criterion black and white films lately that have surprisingly shoddy subtitles.    The bonus materials are NOT shoddy.  They are plentiful as usual, but my favorite was the English language \\"redo\\" of the film.  They took the German movie and refilmed scenes, dubbed others and generally did a butcher job.  I skipped most of it, but you MUST see Lorre recreate his famous monologue in English.  It's far less effective and a great argument for letting folks act in their native languages.    So a great movie, presented with typical panache by Criterion (subtitling being a notable exception).  Of course, this is a film for film-buffs and my review is written with that understanding in mind.  I'm not sure what a more casual film fan might make of this.  I can envision them being fascinated or bored.  But if you've read this far, I'd say you're a film buff and this ought to go on your must-see list.
B0043URV5U|5.0|As SEGAR Says Rock and Roll never forgets This CD brings back alot of great times so long ago I did however miss the song sunspot baby but other wise as good as it gets ALWAYS!!!
B006GG1KOC|4.0|My daughter is 3 and really enjoyed this app.  It got more and more challenging as the game went on and challenged her to think about why some items were different.<br /><br />But, as a few people have said, there were a few that I really didn't understand.  LOL - I'm going to put it down to Mommy Was Exhausted.<br /><br />I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars because, while my daughter liked the app, she finished it in one night and, because she conquered it, has no more interest in it.
0525478817|5.0|The characters come off a bit unbelievable at times (perhaps too sophisticated/calculated - mostly in dialogue), the antagonist (if you want to call a crotchety ole author that) is way, way over the top, and you know the ending pretty from the getgo (i.e., not the twists, but the sadness)...   a small infinity of problems (and I wouldn't really call the last a problem, just a roadblock for some who prefer happy endings), but the larger infinity is pretty close to perfect.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|fantastic game that will keep you busy for a very long time.  a great upgrade to the old atari missile command game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun stuff. I enjoy playing all the games. It is a great way to pass the time!! Very good app.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I don't understand why anyone would rate this app with less than 4 stars.  I use it daily and the provided weather information is always spot on!
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I don't really understand why P. D. James should have written this kind of book. It is too hard write like Jane Austen; and the use of her characters only points up the discrepancy. James is an enjoyable writer, but she is no Jane Austen.  She would have done better to write this as independent historical mystery, without reference to the world of Pride and Prejudice.
B001HN6922|3.0|On the surface, it didn't seem like there was much cause for a direct sequel to this franchise, but given their track record I had to give Pixar the benefit of the doubt. In reality, it didn't take long for those early worries to be confirmed. This is like a jumbo-sized TV episode with incredible production values but a weak, redundant script. Where the original was, clearly, the worst of Pixar's properties, at least it had an honest message at heart; that the abundance of interstates and high speed traffic has ruined the necessity and charm of small-town America, at once mourning and celebrating that lost taste of cultural charm. By comparison, there's really no reason for Cars 2 to exist. It's a straight-up Saturday morning cartoon, shifting from caper to caper without the benefit of a discernible moral. And while there's really nothing wrong with that - there's an insatiable need for kid's fodder on the big screen, certainly - it's depressing to see it coming from the same company responsible for generation-transcending classics like Monsters Inc., Toy Story and Up. While it'll undoubtably sell plenty of toys, this was the wrong movie at the wrong time for Pixar, and a rare instance of the studio losing ground to the competition.
B005MYEQ4U|2.0|**This review may contain spoilers\\"<br /><br />There's an old Twilight Zone episode, a fantasy-drama called 'The Trouble with Templeton' which came out during the iconic show's second season.  It's a similar concept to 'Midnight in Paris'.  Templeton is a fading stage director who believes that his glory days were back in the 20s and gets the opportunity go back there and learn an important lesson.  Unlike the Twilight Zone episode, Woody Allen's story is more of a romantic comedy.  It features Owen Wilson as a hack Hollywood screenwriter who aspires for more as a high brow novelist.  Wilson is the protagonist, Gil,  who's vacationing in Paris with his fiancee and her parents.  Wilson delivers many of Woody Allen's expressions in the same way as 'The Master' and that's probably why Woody praises him vociferously during the news conference extra in the DVD bonus section.<br /><br />As in many other Woody Allen films, the protagonist is friendly with another couple, with the male partner depicted as a pretentious intellectual.  Woody also gets his ubiquitous digs in at right wingers, making jokes at the Tea Party's expense, through the mouth of the father-in-law to be, a corporate executive who decidedly is in the Republican camp.  As usual, Woody's protagonist must move on from a failed relationship with a woman at the end; in this case, it's the fiance, Inez, perkily played by Rachel McAdams.<br /><br />The central conceit of 'Midnight in Paris' is Gil's time traveling back to the 1920s in Paris.  Woody doesn't come up with a very clever mode of transport: a limousine from the 20s appears out of the blue at midnight on a Parisian street and whisks our protagonist back to those heady days where he runs into the likes of Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.<br /><br />During the news conference on the DVD, Woody makes it clear that his intent is to satirize the artistes who Gil runs into.  At first, it's rather neat to watch a perennially intoxicated Zelda Fitzgerald do her thing as well as listen to Cole Porter at at the piano, but soon we realize that Woody has little to say about these iconic figures.  Hemingway isn't very amusing blathering about all his macho concerns and Picasso shows up merely as a buffoon, seducing one woman after another.  Adrien Brody tries his best to suck out humor from a pretentious Salvador Dali but ultimately is unable to come up with anything funny.  There's a brief, slightly humorous bit where Gil suggests to the surrealist film director, Bunuel, the concept for his classic picture, \\"The Exterminating Angel\\", with the exasperated director rejecting it since he tells Gil that it doesn't make any sense.  Kathy Bates has little to do as Gertrude Stein, except offering her critique of Gil's new manuscript.<br /><br />A good part of 'Midnight' has to do with Gil's infatuation with Adriana, one of Picasso's cast-offs.  When Gil finds Adriana's autobiography at a bookseller in the present, he learns that he gave her a pair of earrings back in the 20s. This leads to an awkward scene where he attempts to steal Inez's earrings in order to fulfill the prophetic passage in Adriana's book. Gil is interrupted by Inez and her parents, who have returned to the hotel room after the father has some kind of heart scare.  Gil's machinations, attempting to prevent Inez from discovering that he stole the earrings, don't cut it since he could have avoided the whole predicament by buying earrings for Adriana at a store the next day (and that's what predictably transpires!).<br /><br />Gil finally learns an important life lesson that living in the past is useless when he joins Adriana in traveling back to her golden age of the 1890s.  Back in the 20s, Hemingway speculates that Inez has been cheating on Gil, who confronts her when he returns to the present time.<br /><br />'Midnight in Paris' is watchable but I guarantee you'll forget about this film after a few days.  Please note that Lea Seydoux is sensational as Gabrielle, the bookseller babe that Owen Wilson walks off into the sunset with at film's end!into the sunset with at film's end!
0307279189|5.0|So, I read this book. Twice. I enjoyed the second time even more than the first. And I took off my headphones and started running in the countryside, discovering paths and the beauty around me. I'm not an ultramarathoner, and never will be. But I'll never stop running, cause I too, was born to run.
0307887898|5.0|To some extent, I've been looking for this book for years now.  On a long journey, I've read most of the process people out there.  Eventually, I settled on a few Gurus who see a bigger picture than many of the rest.  Liker's work on Lean/Toyota is fabulous.  Goldratt's Theory of Constraints exposes an essential truth.  Steve Blank talks startups very well.  Alastair Cockburn's Crystal is my favorite thinking in the Agile space.  Overall, there's a lot of separate, very smart thinkers thinking in good directions.  Eric Reis brings it all together.  Not only has he read all the same people I've read, and tried most of the choices, but he's tried all their stuff, seen it fail...and Lean-squared his way into betterness.    This is very simply the best book on the market on the methodology of becoming a learning organization.  HOW do you do it...not just why.    And if that wasn't enough...Ries released his book to massive early review...because he is so steeped in the culture of lean that he couldn't imagine releasing a non-customer-vetted product.    If you want one book that captures the essence of lean...and extends it, there's simply nothing else.  It's the best there is.

B00003CXRM|5.0|Maybe the perfect adventure film, this instant Coen classic is impossible to turn away from. Though it makes no mistake about its influences - an early title card immediately identifies the picture as an adaptation of Homer's Odyssey - the brilliance of O Brother is in its departures from the source material, which come so frequently that the carryovers (the Sirens, the Cyclops, the protagonist's escape from captivity) are celebrated as nods and winks, expected but also unexpected. George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are perfectly cast as the charismatically brainless scoundrels at the story's epicenter, while guest spots from John Goodman, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning take the whole mess over the top. Amazingly rich, sharp-witted, engrossing stuff that's accompanied by an all-time favorite of a soundtrack.
B004132I20|5.0|I was saying to myself the other day what TV Series was going to give me my rush once MI-5(Spooks)was complete.  I think I found it in Sherlock.  At first I was like \\"here we go with another TV show destroying a good movie\\".  I wish I had some peanut butter and jelly to eat my words.  This TV show put the movie to shame.  I watched Season 1 as it was shown on TV and I was like I cannot wait until Season 2,  this is just to intense my nerves cannot take the presure.  I just finished watching the last episode of Season 2.  Holy smokes BATMAN,  this just keeps getting better and better with every episode.  I cannot wait until Series/Season 3 starts next January in the UK.  These are a definite buy on DVD/Blu Ray.  This show will leave you with you month open with every episode wondering what will happen next.  My suggestion is that everyone should have this in their movie/TV library.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is meditative, thought provoking fun. I love it! You deserve this game! For the serious puzzle game player.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I won't waste readers' time trying to review this tome. And I won't get into the discussion of whether or not kids should read it. I'm very close to the end fortunately. It's been a struggle to read more than one chapter at a time. I'm only doing it to complete it.   For me it's one of the most depressing books I've ever read. If I want to be depressed, I can read the daily newspapers and it won't take as long.  It's other flaw is that it's taken too long to tell a depressing story.   Fantasy or not, kids killing kids for sport isn't my interest. Yeah, yeah, I know it goes on every day and the crime genre is much of the same. Maybe so, but this thing made me feel worse than I had I read about another war being started in the Middle East.   Won't be reading the others.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is probably not a typical book that I would read, but something caught my attention and I decided to try it.  I found it to be a terrific book.  Fascinating detail throughout and the characters and story line kept me hooked through every section.  Because of the book, I went to see the movie (Hollywood version) and was surprised to see that they followed the book fairly closely - at least as close as any movie I've ever seen.

B004UXUX7S|5.0|\\"The Descendants\\" is a great movie about a man named Matt King (George Clooney) whose wife is in a coma after a boating accident. Because he's always been kind of a hands-off dad, Matt is unsure of how to relate to his two daughters, 10-year old pretentious Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old troublemaker Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). He's also thrown for a loop when his eldest daughter reveals that his wife had been having an affair before her accident. Matt has to cope with the cold hard facts about his marriage, coupled with his wife's grave condition and the toll this is taking on his family. In addition, Matt's family is pressuring him to sell a large sum of land that their ancestors passed down to them, which is located along the beautiful Hawaaiian coastline. The debate over the land has unexpected connections to Matt's personal situation, and the poor guy has to somehow figure everything out on his own.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Matt King is George Clooney's best role, but it;s definitely one of them. He delivers a moving performance as a man who is completely broken, yet forcing himself to keep it together for the sake of his two kids. I was also very pleased with Woodley's performance as Matt's teenage daughter. Hers is a very complex role, and the young actress tackles it with grace and honesty. The film itself is incredibly well-done, though extremely depressing. I'm glad I saw the film and I definitely recommend it, though it won't be one of those movies that I'm dying to watch over and over again.

B006MQRLSA|5.0|Baseball is one of my favorite sports, and so I'm a sucker for a good baseball movie. That this movie is based on the real-life series of events that significantly changed how Major League Baseball teams evaluate, sign and hire talent, made it all the more interesting for me.   Do not buy this movie if you're looking for stirring on-screen action, tense scenes of the pitcher on the mound staring down batters, and exciting scenes of come-from-behind victories etc. This isn't that movie, it's not Major League of even the Natural. The story of Moneyball is about what it takes to put together an organization that has a chance to win, and so the on-field action is ancillary to the film, and treated as such. We see it, but the action on the field is a result of the real drama happening behind the scenes.  Anyone who follows MLB knows that sabermetrics and the philosophies that Billy Beane took a flyer on, had lasting impact on the game of baseball. Even though his team hasn't been able to win using those theories, other teams have. What's more it kicked the game into the modern world, so the question is now no longer 'Why look at the game in new ways?' but instead 'Why NOT look at the game in new ways?' It doesn't always work out, but change has come to MLB, and there's no going back.  This is the story of how it came to be, and is well worth watching if you're a true fan.
B004PGNB1K|4.0|I rate The Name of the Wind as one of my favourite books. I did enjoy reading A Wise Mans fear, however I felt the story dragged on a bit until picking up about half way through with some new plot elements. A 1000 page book is a big read, however I am somewhat confident the first and second books are a built-up to something much bigger with the last book.<br /><br />What I love most of all about these two books is Rothfuss' writing style. I will have a real go at any of his books because of this. His writing is very poetic and helps the readers follow the story with every emotion activated.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like the games on here and its very addicting some of the game are a little hard but fun.
B0047CPB42|3.0|The film of this book was brilliant so I looked forward to reading the book because I always find the books much better than the films. Films usually miss out so much and the books are often richer. Sadly this was not the case with Shutter Island. I found most of it slow and, quite frankly uninteresting. There was no added layer of depth to the book that I would have expected. I was tempted to jettison it half way through but I struggled on, although it was like wading through treacle. I kept hoping that the book would get better and I knew there was a fantastic twist at the end. Well, it did get marginally better, and the twist was just as good as the film so I suppose it rescued itself by the end. Maybe I came to this book with too high expectations, and maybe if I'd read it before seeing the film I would have liked it better, but I doubt it. As far as I was concerned the only good thing about the book was the twist at the end. It is entirely unexpected and original, whether it is the book you are reading or watching the film. However, my advice would be, watch the film, don't bother with the book.
B001HN694K|5.0|This was the best version of this story that I have ever seen.  It was engrossing and entertaining from start to finish.  The mix of animated characters and live actors was most charming, plus the casting was brilliant, with Helena Bonham Carter as the Red queen, Anne Hathaway as the White queen, and Johnny Depp as the Hatter. Even Crispen Glover was a marvelous choice for the Knave.  All of the little animated characters were so endearing.  The colors were conservative and beautiful (not technicolor but something nicer, more restful)I have no idea what it is called.  I watch this film at least once a week with my breakfast as it puts me in a good mood to start the day.  Disney is indeed a genius.  I'm planning to buy a few more so my grandchildren can enjoy it too.  I'd like to add that the viewers should treat themselves by staying with it during the credits at the end of the film, because the music and vocal performances are just outstanding  I enjoy it as much as I do the movie.  It's most unusual and a delightful surprise.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Great game with simple enough rules to let you concentrate on mastering the game.  The progressilon from one to two suits made it easy to learn with minimal frustration at the novice level.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome, exciting, adicting, fun app.its a great time waster too.I almost didn't get it but I decided to get it. I'm so glad I did.if I love how it makes you work for other games.if I could say one thing to you I would say.......GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think that this is such a fantastic app. I used it during my church service today and was able to easily navigate around.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Just installed this on the kindle fire.  the game works flawlessly and it is really really polished.  The only reason that I deducted a star is because it lacks additional modes and it felt like there was no end to the game.  Not too fond of games that you can't finish... only try to keep beating the high score.    After getting all the upgrades and hitting night 25 it gets way too hard for me.  lots of fun playing it though.
B005LFQRTC|4.0|This is a pretty good set and contains several early episodes, and the original TV Movie.  I am not sure if it is they way it was, or if it was editing, but the BIONIC RUNNING SOUND is not on this product.  It could be that the SHOW added sounds in later episodes, but it is definitely missed.  I will say the episodes get better each time, and I can't wait for Season 2 & Season 3 to become available as well.  If you are NOSTALGIC, like me, and want to relive your childhood, you should purchase this!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you unlock mini games. get it because the games are cool.you need enough money too buy mini games it's free
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I liked angry birds but I love the angry birds seasons better!!!! Also I love applesauce.....and peanuts!! I at like three donutes and a sprite for breakfast......so healthy right?! Duhhhh!!!
B006JPS1OM|4.0|this game is fun if you like finding hidden items and solving mysteries.  I really liked it a lot .
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game with lots of oppitons and games for the mood your in with diffent possibles and chose's?  five stars
B003O86FMW|4.0|Again pleasantly surprised it was a great read. Starts off a little slow for my liking, but then really takes a turn you will not expect and keeps rolling. I enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to anyone.
1439130833|4.0|I`am enjoying my daily secret writings very much,it`s a more in dept look at the secret day by day. It helps me focus on the technique of the secret for that day. The day of the week do`nt match the date, must have been over looked.<br />  peaceful thoughts
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like it because there are so many different games to enjoy. i really like the fact u have more then just one game to play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is so fun, sure you only get 10 games but you rack up points like crazy! I definetly reccimend this games to everyone!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great to pass time. very fun. easy never hard. get this app and have lots of fun everywhere you go.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I loved the Percy Jackson books so of couse I began reading the new series. The 1st book (the Lost Hero) was good but the Son of Neptune was so much better becuase Percy is in it! 5 stars all the way!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun game.  but after a day i dont think i will get any better at it.  it was free though, so i wont complain.
B003ZHR6T8|4.0|Great movie for a great price. With the prime option shippingThis was fast and easy to order an best of all very inexpensively cheap.
B0036S4CTS|2.0|I didn't think this book was very good. I was unimpressed and forced myself to finish it because I had paid $10 for the kindle edition. I would not recommend this book to a friend.The story is cute but it is much too long.  The characters were not as rich as I was hoping and the writing did not pull me in.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|So many attempts to update classic arcade games to modern devices fail. This app doesn't. It keeps the concept of &quot;Missle Command&quot; intact, gives you good control for a touch device, and adds strategy. Very well done.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Very simple and easy to use note taking app.  I use it to make grocery lists to taking notes at our homeowners meetings once a month to taking down important phone numbers and dates of important meetings.  Recommended!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|awesome game and if you enjoy freaking out the farther u get its even better. its not a continuous defense building game I thought it was, instead you go for the high score, which is actually more fun
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I don't think I need to make 20 paragraphs here to get the point across .. this is an awesome film about LOVE! Really down to earth.  A good watch for Valentines Day for sure!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Just as much fun as it was when I was a kid. A classic game on an excellent platform,  Hats off.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Lots of fun on my Acer iconia tablet! Addictive, good graphics, and some unexpected strategy is involved. Love it! :)
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Not like the original but OK. you just can't replicate the original with out a huge track ball. plus there are no missile towers to defend. just lamo trees.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is great game to waste a few minutes or hours with. My 3 year old has a lot of fun with it as well. Some of the games are very challanging.
0307593312|1.0|It pains me to admit I wasted so much time trying to enjoy 932 pages worth of boring pointless nonsense!  I have never in my life had a book annoy me so much that I actually found myself sneering in disgust.  If it hadn't been a gift from someone who normally chooses excellent books, I would have put it down a third of the way in.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|It's ok. I played the game once, got to level 30 and was bored already. I won't play anymore. The end.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a pretty fun game. Really simple for quite a few levels but it eventually picks up. It was free so I can't complain.
0553801473|1.0|After Crows' negligible forward movement, I gave GRRM a few chapters into Dragons to see if he was going to continue to play with himself or if he'd actually move the story forward. After reading the first few chapters, I closed the book, returned it to the bookstore (saying it was an unwanted present), and I exchanged it for a book from a writer who still remembered how to write a story. No intention of purchasing any more GRRM books.
B00004SVIK|5.0|Great album!  I'm a big fan of Pink Floyd and The Wall and I love these CDs.  Sound quality is just about perfect for a live album.  If you like The Wall, you'll love this album.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I have to say that I'm impressed!  Take the classic Missile Command game, and make it play well with touch screen controls.  Then, add in the ability to upgrade your missiles and repair your city, and it becomes a lot more addictive!  Played on Kindle Fire without any issues at all.  Highly recommended.  :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is entertaining tor sure.  it's great when you just want a mindless time waster.  the controls for some games are not great, and the ads are a little irritating, but other than that, it's pretty good.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|This was a good buying experience.  The DVD came quickly, the packaging was pristine, and it played perfectly.  Recommend this seller.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has been to most useful of all my apps. I love the &quot;parallel Bible&quot; set up and the built in reading plan!!! Best app ever!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The birds fly mu h smoother than they do on my iPodtouch! I love this game so much. I could play this forever
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love this game. It keeps you on your toes. keep games like this comming. This game is the best.
B00197YZ7M|5.0|This movie is at the top of the list of my all time favorites.  I have played it several times since receiving it a short time  ago.  It is an absolutely fabulous movie with the greatest   actor/actress of our time.  I would highly recommend it to  anyone who wishes to have one of the greatest movies of all  time in their collection of DVD's.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|lot of fun, good time killer. with the upgrade system, ill be playing for a while. one of the best free apps of the day, and would be worth paying for
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game and it's received more plays on my fire than any other. The ads everyone is complaining about are brief and skippable. Definitely worth the download!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this game is the the best p.s nooks are not thing you want to hit the ground and I strongly think every one would play this and I 13
0894803123|5.0|bought it as a gift along with the kitchenaid ice cream maker. The recipients were really thrilled with it.  It is a great gift combo.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun, addictive and challenging. Great app!!  I'd like to complain about the high cost of the in game upgrades but it's ultimately part of my motivation to play again.  I rate it four out of five.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|This review is made if you only have in mind to buy this processor to play games.   I Probe many synthetic tests, viewing results undesirable, being surpassed even by Intel Core i3 and Phenom X4 but I have read about the architecture of these processors, and perhaps synthetic tests are not prepared for this processor.   I decided to try it in games and the difference was significant, try focusing on games that use and all features of DX11.   I don't know what is doing the combination Radeon 6000 series with these FX processor, but the performance compared to a Phenom II X4 955 and Core i5  in DX11 games make the FX take the lead.   So this process can not keep up in many tests, the architecture certainly wanted to go a step forward, for some tasks is a disaster but for DX11 games using in this test with Radeon 6770 series gets better results than other systems using same video card.  The overclock test was impressive.  Pros:  -Excellent performance in DX11 games Combined with Radeon 6000 Series  -The Cooler is different that Phenom II series, better airflow and less noise.  -low power consumption.  -The new design of heatsink,improving its predecessor  -(for OC lovers)Excelent overclock power, can have an increase up to 800Mhz stable, the performance increases too significantly.  Cons:  -for computation, can be overcome easily in synthetic tests for lower-priced processors  -New architecture ignored by many applications
B005KJZDW6|5.0|What is the point in every current artist releasing a Christmas CD (or two) during their careers when they only deliver us the same boring group of songs? She & Him dared to choose from the same overdone list...but instead of a monotonous and average CD, they gave us new, imaginative versions of the songs we've heard a million times. Their new energy in the classic song rejuvenates the original melodies and makes you fall in love all over again. She & Him is an incredible band and I can't wait for their next release.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app so much I love it even more now that I can play on my kindle yea!!!!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I'm 9 years old and I have read most of his books and enjoyed all of them.But I have to say that this is his best series of them all.I read The Lost Hero,The Son of Neptune and I'm waiting for The Mark of Athena.So The Son of Neptune is my favorite of them all.
B005AUWY90|5.0|No problems with this. Works great, and 3 1/2 year old boy likes it, but prefers the first Cars movie.
B0054R6BFM|1.0|Cannot believe how this story unfolded. Good concept but terrible story line. You end up hating the main characters, and feel absolutely no sympathy for Hannah Baker. Spare yourself and don't buy this book!
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|This movie has been reviewed plenty of times here, so I won't even bother with that. Suffice to say that I think this film is fantastic. I just wrote this review to say that the quality on this DVD is much better than the horrendous quality of the DVD released over a decade ago. If you own the old DVD, I strongly suggest upgrading to this one. This film deserves to be seen in this quality. Hopefully a Blu-ray release is next.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|As the title says this headset is great.<br /><br />Five Stars for Sound, Comfort, and Mic quality.<br /><br />One Star for overall quality as this thing seems to break really easy even with excellent care. I am on my second pair within a year.
B006C1DH92|5.0|this os the best thing you can get buy it it is worth the money&bull;_&bull; get the app it is just like furore nija
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!  I've had other apps that weren't functional.  This is the best!!!  From the reminders to ful functionality, this app is the best!!!
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love this series. Excellent show. Brilliant comedy. I've been watching all the re-runs over and over, so now I have to buy the seasons to make sure I've seen every one!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the games. keeps u occupied and ready to unlock games. I don't know what I did before this app...lmao
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds free app is fun and an a awesome game. you get to launch a bird to destroy the pigs you should download this app because its free and is actually science fun!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Wish every Dad in America would watch this movie.  I had heard this was a great movie and went into it kind of with an attitude of, \\"we'll see, I've seen every kind of movie, I'm sure I won't be that impressed\\".  Well, needless to say I felt like jumping up at the end and cheering, and needed 5 minutes afterwords of no talking so I could compose myself.  And I'm a trained macho 'men don't cry' kinda guy.  I have kids though, and 3 daughters all close in age to the girl in the movie too, so that didn't help matters.  Also, I thought they did a great job of every character being able to connect to anyone that might have watched the movie.  My wife loved it too, can't wait to get it on video...To inspire me again...Turn in up loud and let yourself get into it.  That said, of course, a non-christian may not enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app kept me busy for quite a while.not the best games on market, but interesting enough to keep me entertained
B005QF0GIK|5.0|On first play, I didn't/couldn't place the sound. Later, on 2nd and 3rd listen, the energy and spirit that gripped me  has been as powerful as that of a ghost taking over a host.   I must play this album from 1 to 13, 3 times a day.  Its become a religion, and I am a devout follower.  Awesome soundplay!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was amazing. I'm a Tina Fey fan and reading this book made my love affair deeper. She really puts a lot into the book and I learned stuff about her early life that I didn't know. I enjoyed reading every minute of it. This is one book that you won't be disappointed with.
B005CC0CMC|5.0|I bought the set for my husband as a Christmas gift. He loved it. He spent the next two weeks reading day & night!
B004HGBUVG|2.0|I have enjoyed (some of) Lucinda Williams' work for years, and I have seen her in concert several times. Nevertheless, I can't recommend this CD.  Blessed is the least listenable performance of hers that I have heard.  I've listened to Blessed repeatedly--so I tried.  But this CD does not compare favorably to older work like \\"Lucinda Williams\\", \\"Passionate Kisses\\" or \\"Sweet Old World\\".  Among other reasons, I don't recommend ths release because many of the vocals are grating and out of tune; the songs don't add to territory  that has been covered earlier in her career.  The bonus of the \\"Kitchen Tapes\\" shows that Williams views herself as an \\"artiste\\" who doesn't want to sound \\"pretty\\" or \\"commercial\\".  But I am not intested in knowing that Williams has the \\"artistic integrity\\" to release whatever she wishes.  The bonus CD just isn't interesting or listenable; A couple of the cuts are OK, but you have to endure a lot of really unpleasant sounds to find something worthwhile.  I will take this CD to a CD exchange store and hope to get $1 for it.  3 of 10.  I give Sweet Old World a 9, in contrast.  I would have wanted to know that Williams' voice is tattered and unattactive, before I bought this CD.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|Sometimes you will not be able to move certain pieces. I believe that when you want to move a piece, you should be able to whether its right or not. At times, the game would not let me move any pieces at all even though it was my turn.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is a great Christmas movie.  There are no computer generated special affects; there are just lots of interesting characters who together make a very entertaining and uplifting movie.  It's great for family viewing -- no foul language, suggestives undertones and no nudity.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun old school game with touch screen goodness.  weapon upgrades make it much more better. wasted alot of hours playing.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is so fun!  I love it because my teenager and I are pretty evenly matched so we can both play.  The only thing getting destroyed  are fruit (no blood and guts), that is a welcome change. Love that I can unlock specials without a ton of skill. If young children are playing, pay the $ .99, the ads are a bit adult and a young child may accidentally click on them, but anyone over 10 I say go for it!  Get ready to have a blast.
B000QYNV5Q|5.0|This book is such a classic, definitely one of my favorites now. My friend told me to check it out, so I hopped onto amazon and had the book about a week later. Great service, exactly how it was described.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a great app for the kindle fire.  It brought the 'ol feelin' back like I was in the arcade (oops, just dated myself).  Anyway you cannot go wrong with this app. It's fast paced, obviously the better you are it'll become.more.and.more challenging! Have fun; this one'll stay on my kindle.for awhile. Best part.was that it was free
0812992792|5.0|I read a lot.  I read a diverse cross-section of fiction.  And I am telling you that I have NEVER read anything like Adam Johnson's novel, The Orphan Master's Son.  And I'll cut to the chase here and tell you that it knocked my socks right off!<br /><br />The novel is the story of Pak Jun Do, the eponymous orphan master's son.  Jun Do spends the novel explaining to people that despite his orphan's name and upbringing in an orphanage, that he is not an orphan.  Although he is not parented well, or for long. \\"All orphans are destined for the Army eventually.  But this was how Jun Do, at fourteen, became a tunnel soldier, trained in the art of zero-light combat.\\"<br /><br />This is merely the first chapter of Jun Do's absolutely extraordinary life.  He's a tremendously appealing character, who struggles to overcome the many challenges of his life with integrity and without complaint.  He literally doesn't know there is an alternative to the harsh life he has experienced in North Korea.<br /><br />So, the novel revolves around a terrific central character, and the author has given him an epic and eventful story, but truthfully it's the North Korean setting that makes this story so compelling.  The novel opens with the first of many propaganda bursts played from ubiquitous loudspeakers.  What it broadcasts is insane!<br /><br />\\"In local news, Our Dear Leader Kim Jong Il was seen offering on-the-spot guidance to the engineers deepening the Taedong River channel.  While the Dear Leader lectured to the dredge operators, many doves were seen to spontaneously flock above him, hovering to provide our Reverend General some much needed shade on a hot day.\\"<br /><br />That is just the very tip of the iceberg.  Life in North Korea is like nothing I could imagine in my wildest dreams.  Well, nightmares.  Author Johnson spent years researching the peninsula, and actually had the rare opportunity to visit the country while writing this novel.  It is fascinating in a truly horrifying way.  I will never listen to news out of North Korea the same way again.<br /><br />I could write more about Jun Do's picaresque story, but the joy here is in watching it unfold.  The Orphan Master's Son has been described as a literary novel, a romance, and a thriller.  It is all of those things and more.  Beneath the surface of the story, there is commentary not only on life in this oppressive realm, but in our own.  And it's actually about the role that the stories we tell has on the direction of our lives.  It has humor, emotion, heart, and a hero you'll root for.  This is a powerful novel and simply fantastic storytelling.  I highly recommend it for pretty much everyone.  This early in the year, I may just have read one of 2012's best books.h Korea the same way again.  I could write more about Jun Do's picaresque story, but the joy here is in watching it unfold.

031606792X|5.0|This entire series was outstanding.  The movies (only saw the first two because I couldn't bring myself to waste  my time and money on the next two) were awful.  Besides being geared towards teenagers, the acting and/or directing was really  bad.  The books on the other hand appeal to all ages.  The author pulls you in right away and keeps you.  I don't usually read more than a half hour a day, but with these books I read hours each day, neglecting other things I should have been doing.    Don't let the teenage craze and bad movies put you off this series.  Read the story; it's a great one!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a great way to waste time and have fun!!!!some games are hard but if u keep trying u can get plots of points and unlock different games!!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Chevy Chase at his very best.  We watch this movie every Christmas and decided to buy it rather than rely on a TV station to air it when we wanted to see it.  Funny, funny Christmas movie.
0062082353|1.0|I tried reading this book but it was really just boring.  Now I hear his team mates are discounting his so called story.  This guy sounds like he got mental trouble
B003EYVXTG|4.0|Didn't know the content of the film before viewing so didn't know what to expect.  This film has good acting, educational content, gritty scenery and difficult to watch footage.  It is an adult film but could be good for older teens because of the main characters plight.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) wants to solve the 40 year old disappearance/murder of his 16 year old niece. He enlists the help of investigative reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who thinks he is on to something. He needs an assistant and employs the talents of Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) in the title role. Lisabeth is a savvy psychotic bisexual computer hacker/investigator who provides us with a dark bizarre subplot.<br /><br />During the investigation they uncover hints that point to a serial killer, who kills Jewish women based on quotes from Leviticus. The mystery isn't too hard to figure out with the numerous clues that they give you. The movie is best when Rooney Mara is on the screen.<br /><br />F-bomb, rape, sex, nudity (Rooney Mara)
B004UXUUDA|5.0|What a powerful film. The ending will blow you away. Another film on the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup you say? Yes, but so much more. The meeting of the past with the present is rendered with great mastery. Maybe the best film I've seen this year. A must see! 10/10
B004H4XLRE|4.0|Santa brought this toy for my 5 year old son for Christmas and he loves it.  He was accumulating many Cars cars and didn't have a good way to store them. This toy stores quite a few cars, and it is really cute when it is set up as a set of stands for a race with all of the cars watching in the stands.  He is able to leave them set up in his room on display this way, or the toy can be closed up and has a carrying handle to take with us. Good value for the money and definitely made him happy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Not the most productive thing to do but it is a great way to kill time. some of them are extremely annoying though.
0525478817|5.0|Although I'm a fan of all his work, this is John Green at his best. The Fault in Our Stars reaches a whole new level of perfection. I cannot get over its beauty.  I cried, I laughed aloud, and I just kept turning the pages; simply mesmerized. Mr. Green builds astonishingly real characters that you will fall in love with. It will be something that I read over and over again. It made me think, feel, and ultimately gave me some peace about the \\"limited\\" time we have here on earth. I must thank John Green for creating this.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|My children ages 14-8 love this toy.  It's hours of enjoyment and makes them slow down and focus.  We recently took a 20 hour road trip and it became a competition to see who could get farther.  Highly recommend!
B00319KS7C|5.0|I loved the Marvin Hamlisch throw back music which greatly enhanced the story. Matt Damon is a biochemical engineer for Archer Daniels Midland. He is in charge of lysine production, which is having problems. He claims the problem is a virus that a Japanese mole has introduced to the product. The FBI is called in. Matt informs the FBI of another evil that is on going...international lysine price fixing! Matt comes across as a squeaky clean guy who only wants to help make things right. He believes by informing on his company the board of directors will reward him for doing right by making him CEO. If you don't see the humor in that, you most likely won't enjoy the film.<br /><br />The FBI has Matt go undercover in what is the nerdiest undercover man to wear a wire. I had to laugh at Matt's character as he played 0014 spy. When things start to hit the fan, it gets weird and twisted.<br /><br />This reminded me of an old 60's style comedy with Damon being super intelligent and naive. I would have enjoyed the film even if it wasn't based on a true story. Great characters.<br /><br />F-bomb, no sex or nudity.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|if you like games then this is great, there is something for everyone and the more you play the more you can unlock to play
B002BY77CW|5.0|I was impressed with L.A. Candy. I didn't expect it to be all that good since it was Lauren's first book and all. Loved it though! It was fun, breezy and hard to put down.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a nice version of a classic.  I like the touch control on my fire, it is easy and very responsive.
B0063IH60K|4.0|i really like this game. i installed it a  ouple days ago and have played at leastan hour a day. very addictive...
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this is a well done, fun arcade style game. multiple levels and upgrades give it good replay value. I recommend it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is entertaining and fun. I was addicted from the start and it provided many hours of fun. Would highly recommend for adults and kids.
B000VS6P9Q|5.0|First off, the Willie Nelson/ Calexico version of TALES OF YANKEE POWER is without a doubt the best Bob Dylan cover ever. This is one of the few Dylan songs that I really love better as a cover song. Dylans original is great but it is a song that has a lot of potential beyond the original, and Willie Nelson and Calexico really bring it out,,, even adding a verse in Spanish that takes the song to incredible heights. Major five star right there alone.  I also really like the Mira Billings cover of AS I WENT OUT ONE MORNING, and give note to the Black Keys rocking electric cover of WICKED MESSENGER.<br /><br />The part I like best about this mix is that it all comes from this weird movie, so decidely every version is done with sort of a weird intent... varied vibe throughout, but you might catch what I'm saying...
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys missile defense games.  Thank you Amazon for providing games like this for free.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I spend too much time playing this game...love it! I do wish you could see a picture of the games before you buy them though
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really appreciate this app and all of the features it has. it is an awesome tool that I use on a daily basis
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Takes you back to the old missile command from the 80's.  A lot of fun.  Great features to regenerate you city.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great app for some fun games. The instructions are great too. I like the vintage feel of the games a lot.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|This processor is currently running in my rig, and I'm really happy with it. I was worried about it performing well, but it runs roughly as fast as a stock i5 if you're running games. Performs better than any AMD chip I've seen.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great games for the whole family at all different skill levels. Only wish we could earn the games faster. would still recommend this game though.
B005K17RU0|5.0|if you want the weather and radar, this is the app for you. its simple and straightforward with easy to learn menus.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|The gameplay is decent.  Perhaps it's a bit too simple.  The annoying bomb sound effect does grind on your nerves.  Apparently there are no special powerups and no surprises.  Graphics are pretty mediocre despite decent game play.  It's probably worth the $0.99 they're asking for it, but not really much more.<br /><br />Overall it's decent.  Despite all the 5 star reviews which are way too kind, I think it earns a solid 3 stars and if you like missile defense games then you'll probably like it, otherwise it's not really that challenging, there's very little depth, nor does it look all that amazing.

B005OK721G|3.0|How do I rate this thing???  Pros  -Exciting - definitely action filled.  -Saldana is physically built perfectly for this character.  -The scenic shots are great in my opinion, even though the shots are from Mexico, France and the U.S.  Cons  -Everyone speaks English, when its clear they should be speaking Spanish  -The plot is so ridiculous you comment out loud things like \\"OH COME ON...REALLY?\\"  -Saldana isn't given enough to work with script wise. They clearly wanted sexy shots, not oscar winning acting  Some movies are so bad, you have to walk out/stop the dvd player before it's over. This is not one of them. You'll be able to stay until the end with no problem, but you'll be thinking \\"THIS IS SO BAD\\" the whole way. If you want to stay in on a cold winter night, order a pizza and rent a dvd with friends, this is the movie. If you're looking for a serious action film, this will make you mad.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This was a fun puzzle game, but extremely short.  like 20 minutes to beat short.  It may be challenging for kids, but adults should have no problem with this game. True it was described as &quot;family friendly&quot;, which it is, but an age rating may be appropriate for this game so that people expecting more of a challenge don't end up wasting there money for somehig the will entertain less than an hour.  Hopefully there will be updates wit more levels.

159514188X|4.0|Clay Jensen arrives home from school one day and notices a package on his front porch, addressed to him with no returned address. Curiosity has him open the package, never realizing that the contents of the package will never leave him the same again.<br /><br />What Clay finds inside the package is a bunch of cassette tapes. Each numbered 1-13 in nail polish. As he puts the first tape in an old cassette player, he hears the voice of a dead Hannah Baker. Before her death, Hannah made a tape for each person she felt was in some way responsible for her death. In some small or profound way she tells each person their role in her demise. After each person listens to the tapes all the way through, they are to pass the tapes on to the next person on the tape. After listening to the tapes, each person will be left with something that they will have to face about themselves.<br /><br />Th1rteen R3asons Why by Jay Asher is a spellbinding read. To know that you are in essence listening to someone that is now dead brings chills to your soul. To know the last thoughts and turmoil that Hannah Baker went through is heartbreaking. To know that if  just one person would have heard her cry for help or paid more attention to her, just maybe...maybe, it could have prevented such a senseless death. In reading this book, the reader is sure to take many things away from it. You are sure to be more aware of the people around you, you may realize how important it is to let people know how you feel about them now, whether if its some way they may have hurt you or maybe to let them know how much you appreciate or value them being in your life. The fact of the matter remains that life is so short, and to quote the author \\"No one knows for certain how much impact they have on the lives of other people. Oftentimes, we have no clue.\\" So let this be the reason to open someone's eyes...before it is too late. Author Jay Asher did a wonderful job in the telling of this fictional story. The story is mesmerizing to say the least. One that will leave a lasting impression with you long after you finish.  I would highly recommend this book!<br /><br />Reviewed by Leonamesmerizing to say the least. One that will leave a lasting impression with you long after you finish.

0525478817|5.0|I've been critical of certain elements in John Green's other books, but The Fault in Our Stars exceeds all expectations. Here you will find the same humor and insight that John is known for, but the material is more raw, the characters more rich, the goals more ambitious, and the payoff much more satisfying. This book moved me on a foundational level.
B005LAIGLE|3.0|Well, Mark Wahlberg is up to his neck in another daring heist, except that CONTRABAND comes off as a poor cousin to THE ITALIAN JOB. What's a shame is that Wahlberg gets support from a roster of high profile Hollywood names, and so you'd think the script would've done this casting coup a service. Instead, we're treated - or maybe \\"played with\\" is a better word - to a routine caper. On doldrum days when the box office is slow, I might recommend CONTRABAND. But, right now, with an assembly of top notch feature films currently holding court? No, skip this 'til the DVD comes out.<br /><br />Breaking down the plot: Chris Farraday (Wahlberg) nowadays runs his own security system service, and he's content. But not so long ago, Chris used to run something entirely contrary to his current enterprise. In New Orleans, back in the day, Chris Farraday was a world class smuggler, bold and inventive. Today, he has a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) and two young sons, and so he's walking the straight and narrow. But you know that old saw about just when you think you're out...<br /><br />When Chris's screw-up brother-in-law Andy fouls up a drug run and cheeses off the local crime boss (Giovanni Ribisi), Chris must step back into his old life to settle Andy's debt. At this stage of the story, if you anticipate CONTRABAND as a relentless action-thriller, you'd not be right. A huge chunk of Chris's master plan is to board a freight ship and use it to ferry his loot. That he runs up against the ship's suspicious Captain Camp (J.K.Simmons at his growly best) and manages to tweak him in the nose is just a bonus. On the freighter he meets the rest of his smuggling crew, and it's too bad the script fails to give them much to do. As it is, they don't really register on my radar, except for that one really cautious guy. The film shifts back and forth between Chris' onboard machinations and how his wife, Kate, and his kids are faring back home (they're not faring real well, considering they are continually menaced by Ribisi). Chris's best friend, Sebastian (Ben Foster) is tasked with protecting Chris's family. But since when has Ben Foster ever played a reliably straight-forward character? Well, maybe this time. The first half of the film plods along.<br /><br />The action finally heats up when the freighter arrives at its destination of Panama. Chris and Andy (and their cautious colleague) disembark and here is where I question the timeline. Confined to less than an hour to conduct his business, Chris manages to inadvertently tick off Panama City's current underworld kingpin, get involved in an armored truck heist, evade the policia, and sneak himself and his contraband onboard the freighter just as it's sailing away. This all seems a little too busy for me, but he's not called the \\"Houdini of smuggling\\" for nothing. Somewhere, Phileas Fogg has scheduled a few minutes in which to be impressed.<br /><br />This is a remake of the Icelandic 2009 thriller Reykjav&iacute;k-Rotterdam which starred Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur, a guy who's switched hats because he ended up directing CONTRABAND. Based on his helm work here, I'm not so enthused to check out the original film. The best thing about CONTRABAND is Ben Foster, which is not at all surprising, seeing as Foster is usually the best thing in whatever film he's in. It's fun to see him gradually melt down. On the other hand, a shockingly blonde Kate Beckinsale takes on a thankless role. Giovanni Ribisi, usually a fine actor, adopts this absolutely grating voice (think a whinier Marlon Brando). Every time he spoke, my hand twitched reflexively to slap him upside the head. But this isn't an awful movie. It has merits. I get a kick out of how a Jackson Pollock painting was dismissed and discarded as tarpaulin. From the Panama City sequence on, I was invested. I'll say this for Mark Wahlberg, he's at his best when he's simmering with righteous fury. You don't want this cat to tell you that he's coming for you. And when he's not thrashing the ef out of them hooligans, he's outwitting them silly. Without dropping any details, I'll mention that his ploy to ultimately confound Ribisi and his henchmen is pretty damn inspired. So, yes, there are watchable elements in this  slow burn action thriller. But I'm still holding out for the ITALIAN JOB sequel.d when he's not thrashing the ef out of them hooligans, he's outwitting them silly.

B004132HZS|5.0|This riveting update of Sherlock Holmes is a lot of fun without sacrificing any of the intelligence of the original stories. Careful readers of the Conan Doyle stories wondered if there might be something just a bit off about Sherlock. Indeed, Watson is warned away from Sherlock by several people. This modern interpretation answers that query describing Sherlock as a high functioning sociopath and portraying him as s genius savant. Watson is a veteran who misses the adrenaline rush of combat and gets that rush with Sherlock. The landlady is just as silly and charming a foil for her lodgers as ever.<br /><br />The first mystery, Study in Pink, introduces the villainous Moriarty in a confrontation with Watson and the killer Sherlock is chasing is delightfully creepy. I really enjoyed this series and will be seeking more out. Witty writing, good acting, engaging scripts and a noirish London that does justice to the foggy original this modern Sherlock Holmes is highly recommended. Not just for fans of BBC mysteries but for fans of all mysteries and procedurals.

B0059XTTW8|1.0|I had not seen the 1970s BBC TV series, nor had I read the original Le Carre book. But I did see the trailer for this movie on a number of occasions in the last month or so when going to other movies. The trailer is outstanding from start to finish, giving hints of the big spy drama to come, with that deep voice whispering \\"there is a mole at the top\\". And then that all-star cast! I couldn't wait to see the movie.<br /><br />The movie came out here in Cincinnati just this weekend, and I saw it last night. Oh my, where to begin? How about this: this movie managed to bore me out of my mind, for real. Things were happening on the screen, and as I was watching it, I thought to myself \\"What is going on here? This movie makes no sense whatsoever!\\". I truly couldn't make heads or tails from anything that was happening, and the movie did absolutely nothing to me. Gary Oldman seemingly moved from scene to scene but I didn't understand why, or what he was doing. All that great acting talent: Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, and on and on: all wasted for naught.<br /><br />I see about 100 movies a year in the theatre, and I end up walking out of a movie maybe once a year. Well, I've already reached my quota for 2012, as I walked out of Tinker, Tailor about 75 min. into it, as I simply couldn't take it anymore and I realized I was wasting my time. A boring and incomprehensible mess is what this movie is, sadly.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this book after having it recommended by many others. I was a little worried about reading a booh where the H is so domineering, but I decided to try in anyways. I was truly sucked in from the first page. This was totally different from anything I had ever read before and have since found nothing comparable. I highly recommend reading this, but make sure you have nothing else that needs done for a while because you will NOT be able to put it down.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|DOWNTON ABBEY, a period drama set before and during WWI, centering around the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants continues to entrance and beguile in the second season. Period dramas are a mainstay of Masterpiece Theater and BBC dramas in general but most are based on classic works of literature rather than originally scripted dramas. The fact that this is originally scripted by Andrew Davies allows Downton Abbey to examine the period and the enormous social changes taking place with a modern sensibility that wows viewers.<br /><br />The Crawley family has adjusted to the fact that a distant cousin is now the heir to Downton and that he and Lady Mary will not marry. Now the heir is threatened by WWI; Matthew may die as so many young men did in that terrible war. The scheming Thomas is also in the trenches of WWI, but in true Thomas fashion plots to get out and find himself a safe sinecure in which to ride out the war. Lady Mary is seeking a suitable husband as Matthew has chosen elsewhere and Lord Crawley is coping with the fact that his war will be on the homefront. Bateses wife returns with consequences to all memebers of the household both upstairs and down. The younger girls are doing war work. Indeed, the set-up for a marvelous dramatic season is in place.<br /><br />Downton Abbey is well-written, well acted and has beautiful production values. The house where it is set is used for both interiors and exteriors and the viewer gets a veritable tour of a stately house. The costumes are wonderful and are showing the nascent beginnings of what will become Art Deco. Truly I can't find a single criticism of this wonderful period drama and neither can the record number of viewers worldwide. If you aren't already a fan start watching at your earliest possible convenience. Season One is available on disc and streaming and Season Two is available for streaming after episodes air on Sunday evenings.

I reordered in black and just recieved it can't wait to try it out.  Re-ordered this in black and have had it for about two weeks. I love it! It is lightweight since the Fire is pretty heavy this is a must. alos I find the prop up shelf works just fine with the weight of the Kindle in it. It is well worth the 30.00 I paid.

Fast Five, The fast and the furious, 2 fast 2 furious, Fast and Furious, and then tokyo drift. The cars were really cool in this movie and the story was pretty good. Would recommend to any fast and furious fan.

B006XF5BTG|4.0|I'd been working out religiously five days per week for about 2 years before I started Michael's program. During that time, I'd made fairly good progress for the first 6 months, but then after that I \\"plateau'd.\\" I wouldn't really gain or lose after that point. I tried changing my workouts, taking every supplement under the sun (except steroids), and special diets.   Then I started doing Michael's program. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was gaining muscle again. Not any ridiculous overnight changes, but I was steadily gaining real lean muscle. Within a few months of sticking to the program I was actually happy with my muscle mass and the way I looked for the first time ever.   I'm a \\"tough gainer,\\" meaning I naturally put on muscle slowly and I'm also much more prone to gaining fat. But this program definitely works for me. I gave it to five or six of my friends who work out as well, and every single one of them started gaining muscle MUCH faster they were previously. I was actually pretty shocked by that, because from I've seen over the years, different programs work for different people and everyone is unique. I'd never seen one program that works the best for everybody, but that is exactly what happened with this program. I guess it's because this isn't so much a \\"program\\" as it is just the basics of how gaining muscle and losing fat works. I know people who used the information in this book to get real big and also people who used it to get lean and cut, down to about 6% body fat.  I'm still using this program, trying to achieve my ultimate goal, and now I'm comfortable knowing that I will--as long as I stick with the program. Good luck making your goals, too. I think this book will help you do it.
B002ONC9NC|1.0|I cannot understand how this movie received the professional reviews it's gotten.  1. David, the male lead, is neither charming nor tragic. He's completely bland and unbearably awkward. He makes the old \\"I didn't know you had a sister\\" joke to a middle-aged woman who is so visibly old that his compliment almost seems a patronizing insult. He's probably 29-32 years old, but babytalks to a 16-year old girl who he calls his \\"minnie mouse\\" before asking to stare at her boobs. This would be fine if ANYONE in the movie recognized this as pathetic. No one does - it's taken as normal by the characters, the director, and the scriptwriter that this almost middle-aged man is flirting with a high school girl. It's treated as absolute normalcy. I had to pause the movie several times and go do something else just because I was so frustrated and turned-off.   2. Jenny, the female lead, is a high school girl played by a 24 year old. She does not sell the age at all. She acts as if marrying David is a real alternative to Oxford, and exclaims that her life has become incredible after meeting him because she's \\"been to movies and restaurants.\\" That last quote is important - her character is so inexperienced that she believes going to movies to be a viable lifestyle. That's fine - again, she is supposed to be inexperienced. But once again, NO ONE in the movie attempts to correct her. Her english teacher tells her that she should go to Harvard, Jenny responds with naive blab about how a person dies when they graduate college, and the teacher capitulates! She looks away and, nearing the point of tears, asks Jenny to please leave. Someone please stand up to this little girl!   3. The way Jenny talks is almost unbearable. She's an arrogant, conceited know-it-all. Again, fine, but no adult in the entire movie actually recognizes this on behalf of the audience, and we're left completely disliking her. So much of what she says is just plain \\"wrong.\\" She berates the educational system and \\"getting a degree\\" because it is boring, but her alternative is \\"going to Paris and Rome and listening to jazz and eating food.\\" Excuse me? You want 70 years of going to Paris and Rome and listening to music? NO ONE CORRECTS HER - she shuts every adult in the movie up. The problem isn't that she's doing/saying all these ridiculous things - it's that the movie presents her as being in the right while doing them. There's some kind of absurd disconnect going on. She wants to make all her own decisions and believes she has the wisdom to do so; then she asks her father for advice on whether or not to marry; then gets angry when he wants to confront David about the fact that he's already married. She even goes as far as pulling the \\"oh so now you want to be my father?\\" bit that we've seen a thousand times. The movie has massive plot-holes in the sense that the social interactions between people make zero sense. Just incredibly irritating to watch.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a fun game. Better than Missle Command. I like the weapon upgrades and repairing the buildings idea. Only problem is I made it a lot farther the first time than I would have expected, so it may be too easy then too hard so I always end up with about the same score.

1419802356|5.0|I've yet to read the book (of the same title) by Jonathan Safran Foer, but I found this movie adaptation directed by Liev Schreiber (who has been in several Holocaust-themed dramas, such as \\"Jakob the Liar\\" and most recently \\"Defiance\\") to be engrossing and entertaining with a blend of both the comic and tragic. This is quite impressive considering the movie marks Schreiber's directorial debut.<br /><br />The story centers around a young Jewish man, Jonathan Safran Foer (played by Elijah Wood) who has a penchant for collecting things in little ziploc bags, ranging from the ordinary to the truly bizarre(his grandmother's dentures). This obsessive collecting is due to his fear of forgetting the past, and when his dying grandmother passes him two keepsakes that belonged to his deceased grandfather, Jonathan decides to travel to Odessa, Ukraine in an attempt to discover his grandfather's past. One of these keepsakes is a picture with his grandfather Safran and a young woman who apparently saved Safran from the Nazis during WW II. To aid him on his quest, Jonathan hires two guides, Alexander Perchov (Eugene Hutz in a brilliant performance) who is obsessed with Michael Jackson, and his grouchy and anti-Semitic grandfather (Boris Laskin who also delivers a powerful performance). Grandpa has a psychotic dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (go figure) and the trio proceed on their journey - destination is Trachimbrod, which used to be a Jewish shtetl.<br /><br />Most of the movie focuses on the road trip and is quite hilarious, especially in watching the dynamics of three very different people travelling together. Grandpa's virulent anti-Semitism is softened by Alex's creative translation efforts (since Grandpa only speaks Ukrainian, Jonathan relies on Alex to translate for him). I could not help but laugh out loud at Alex's overzealous attempts at speaking English - \\"Do you repose?\\" he asks Jonathan, eliciting a sort of \\"huh\\" response until Jonathan figures out he means \\"sleeping\\"! The last third of the movie focuses on what happens to the trip after they finally find a home in the countryside where an old woman (Laryssa Lauret) helps Jonathan find some closure. There are also some interesting twists in the story at this point, with some startling revelations.<br /><br />I found this a refreshing Holocaust-themed drama. The Holocaust by its very subject matter is hard to depict on screen without resorting to the usual depictions of stomach-churning brutality (as evidenced by dramas like \\"Schindler's List\\", \\"The Grey Zone\\", \\"War and Remembrance\\", and \\"Holocaust\\", amongst others). In \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" there is a balance between the tragic and the comic, and even the flashbacks to the past involving violence is subtly done. The focal point here is not so much the horrors of the Holocaust but of people searching for closure and making peace with events of the past. The strong cast makes this an above-average film, delivering credible and compelling performances. The cinematography is gorgeous, capturing the lush beauty of the countryside. The DVD itself contains no bonus worth mentioning (just some deleted scenes and a trailer). Final verdict - compelling and engaging drama.the movie focuses on what happens to the trip after they finally find a home in the countryside where an old woman (Laryssa Lauret) helps Jonathan find some closure.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I was looking for gaming headphones because I couldn't install a home theater for my pc,so I got to this headset.  after reading about 50 reviews I decided to try them so I got them from a local best buy store for about $20 more.  when I first got them I tested the surround sound in movies and games (I tried to walk in gta san andreas when someone is talking behind me,it really sounds like surround! ) but then they started to crackle and disort so I was kind of disapointed and I thought about returning them.  I searched google to see if there is a way to fix it,I got a few times to the same answer just in different websites.   If you have crackling you need to reinstall the usb driver,I tried it and it worked! now I don't have any problems at all with these headsets,they have great quality and could be turned up loud without disorting. also no need to boost the bass for music and movies,they just need to be tight on you ears to hear the bass,try pushing them gently on your ears so it would be completely sealed,you will see that they have nice tight bass.  they do leak sound outside,like someone else can hear what your listening to. it doesn't really matter to me,I can listen to movies with quality sound and feel like I have a large room with a full 7.1 setup and I don't get any complains from other family members from the rumbles of the bass,all they hear is very little disorted sound through the walls. it really is a awesome headset!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved it. I didn't want to put it down. Reading the reviews though was a good idea. They gave me a much better idea of what to expect.
B005KR6NS6|5.0|The film was engaging, beautifully shot and depicted a fascinating portrait of self discovery. I enjoyed the plot, the acting, the dancing, the music and the overall production very much. Sally Potter is very talented.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Exactly what I wanted: a complete set of all the Harry Potter movies. Very good quality too, and was shipped on time (just like every Amazon item I ordered).
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Solid flick and good storytelling but would have liked to see more action especially for the captain. There seemed to be way more talk & character development/interacttion with each other (which is necessary to a point) but def could of used some more fighting/action scenes for CA.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|this game is fast paced so you have to move fast and anticipate 2 steps ahead at all times.  managing your buildings is also critical. this is a great action game and also a thinking game.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|For me anyway.  It took me quite a while to figure it out, but in the end this app performs beautifully.
B0034G4P94|5.0|This movie is a great story of one's effort to overcome their position through whatever means are at their disposal. The story focuses on two brothers who find themselves living in a bad situation because of previous bad decisions. No after being away from each other for a number of years, they find their desperation has brought them together in a siting where they have to fight each other to gain their salvation. They have go through a lot to get to that point, but find that what they were fighting for was not the biggest reward for all their efforts. It is well acted, and very enjoyable. Get it!!!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|i love playing chess, and now i can play it on my kindle fire. you should get this awesome game
B005XQLBU4|4.0|it is very fun and gets much harder when you get far into the game. great for anyone who likes a challenge
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the games, some are too easy and some too hard, but I like the variability.  The difficult games are usually difficult because the accuracy with my finger on the touchscreen isn't too good.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I don't care for the insistence on using a reading plan.  I wanted to be able to read an NIV Bible on my Kindle Fire, which allows me to adjust the font size.  I can switch between the old and the new version of the NIV.  This app gives me all of that.  Sure didn't have to pay ten to twenty bucks for a Kindle print version.
B0024FAR5M|2.0|Not my cup of tea, but maybe something others might want to watch. I mean I found it boring. It just seemed like a group of people who were trying hard to offer a show about choices and crime, but what happened to me was that they ended up with a white trash version of the Sopranos. It was not really new or innovative, just tired and desperate. Maybe you'll like it, but I could imagine that. So make up your mind for yourself.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its good and I like it a lot its very challenging and hard to get points I'm glad the points
0307891402|5.0|When I went to my local Gamestop, I inquired about a guide for Skyrim (which is highly popular) I was given the steep price of $40.00 due to the fact that this guide was a collector's edition. I promptly checked Amazon.com for the same product and observed the price was approximately 21.00. I showed the employee at Gamestop the price and advised him that I would not be doing business with them for that guide. You should have seen the look on his face. Thank you Amazon for this beautiful hardback guide and a wonderful price. Highly recommend to all gamers who are tired of getting ripped off by Gamestop or any other local video game dealer...
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Anyone who played missile command back in the day will like this app. Simple, clean, fun. Got it for free, but worth the price.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great free app with tuns of quick and mostly easy games.  Some are quit addictive but others can be confusing.  Over a solid free app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is one of the most awesome best games in the entire world the game has many fifteenth activity's and it is very addicting
B000UJCALI|1.0|I would rather watch a litter of puppies being thrown into a wood chipper than this abortion of a movie. Other than the names of some of the characters and the setting of the Overlook, there are no similarities with the book, literally none. How could King give the okay for this version, it makes me sick. I haven't seen the miniseries yet, but it's hard to believe it could be any worse. What a waste of some good acting, too. Nicholson playing the real Jack Torrance would have been terrifying.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|I watched this last night and was pleasantly surprised. Beyonce worked it! Because I really didn't care for her I Am Yours Tour DVD. But this one I loved because they showed the personal side of Beyonce. This is up there with her Beyonce Experince DVD.  I would recommend this DVD.
0062060554|4.0|Reviews seem to be decisively love or hate on this book, but I have to land myself in the middle on this one. Maybe it's because the first half had me glued to my seat while the second half left me vaguely disappointed, underwhelmed, yet still hooked. This is not the next great novel, it is a fun read when you just want to coast through to get your mind of the plummeting temperatures out the window.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun free app. I enjoy playing it when I have a few extra minutes, bit it can become addictive. the only problem I had is that some of the games don't give good instructions
0525478817|5.0|I guess technically I should finish this book before reviewing it, but it is great and wonderful and beautiful. I have about 80 pages left (which won't take long at all). I love John Green's eloquence in writing this book. He insured that it is philosophical yet light-hearted, romantic yet not too sappy, and most importantly, it is quite funny. Thank you, John Green, for being among my favorite authors; I hope to read more from you in the future.
0439023513|5.0|I, love this book.  In fact, I love the entire series of \\"The Hunger Games\\", and I believe it's one of the best book series I've read.    I enjoy that the book introduces the characters over time, such as Boggs, appearing as a straight-forward, military man, to someone that agrees alot and relates to Katniss, even giving her permission to use the Holo when he passed away.  How they show the slow ascension from madness in Peeta suggests that he never really meant to hurt Katniss (or anyone in that matter), but was \\"programmed\\" to, is a bit overwhelming, but finished finely; with him not truly cured, but well enough to raise a family.  Katniss was shown as a seventeen year old who was descending into madness, surviving two Hunger Games' and watching her own little sister die.    But the twist when Katniss talked to President Snow was excellent, stating that President Coin had killed her little sister to make her think that Snow had caused it.  But just that shocking revelation to Katniss, caused her to rethink everything.  This leads to her killing Coin instead of Snow.  Yet on the next page (page 373), she says, \\"I see (Snow) bend foward, spewing out his life, until the guards block him from my sight,\\" leads the reader to believe that even though Snow won, he lost. In short, it finished up the series quite well, I believe.  Yes, there were some things I believe could've been changed, but it wouldn't be the same book.  All I have to say is that everyone should pick up a copy of \\"The Hunger Games\\" and continue to read the series.
1439153663|5.0|This book was very compelling. Sort of a hybrid of a Jane Austin novel and Gone With The Wind. I couldn't put it down, and missed the characters once I finished it. I hope there's a sequel! It's a good read.
0061564893|5.0|This is a truly fascinating book, much more so than I had anticipated.  Menzies makes his case with 120 pages of proof and source material.  In one of the last chapters he debunks the Columbus myth and it is dazzling!  I loved it.  I have always disagreed with the \\"Columbus Day\\" myth, now I have proof to back that up.  The day should be changed to \\"Explorers Day\\" and include the Norse, Chinese, and astronauts, among others.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fruit ninja is a fun game. It will keep you busy for a while. Very fun game, also very addicting. You will not be able to stop playing fruit ninja.
0007430043|5.0|Lost and Found pop up edition is simply magical, the story and the illustrations are fantastic, they move round and change to flow beautifully with the story.<br /><br />One day a boy finds a penguin at his doorstep, he thinks he must be lost, so sets out to find where he comes from. The little boy sets out on his adventure in his row-boat, to the South Pole, to bring the poor little penguin home.<br /><br />In the end he goes back to find the penguin because he realises he isn't lost, he's just lonely. The whole story is simply darling, everything was so well written and put together, my little one (3) was entranced from start to finish, she kept going back to the book, pulling the tabs, popping up the pages and flipping the tabs up and down.<br /><br />My daughter loved it so much she is away to bed with it, with a reminder to be very careful with all the little tabs.<br /><br />Oliver Jeffers has done a wonderful job with Lost and Found, we will go back and read it again and again, a new favourite.<br /><br />A big thank-you to Harper Collins for the review copy. :)<br /><br />Put this on your wishlist for your little one today, they will love it.
