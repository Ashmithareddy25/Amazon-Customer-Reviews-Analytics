B000YIGNKE|3.0|The gold standard of Jane Austen books to movies is the Colin Firth version of P&P, and part of that I credit to the length of the movie. All the subtlties and emotions of an Austen novel take time to draw out, and when I saw that this version of Persuasion was 90 minutes I was so shocked I thought it had to have a second part. Instead I got rushed scenes that were telling a story without much of a sense of what was going on. The early scenes where Anne and Captin Wentworth meet are so short that there's little chance for the viewer to feel the intensity of the emotions, the sense of longing and loss, instead just as you get it, they'e on to another important part and you get wiplash. Their walk through the woods was just odd to me, again while reading the book I remember there being an intensity and it felt long and drawn out, but the scene just moves along, suddenly Anne falls and then the climax where Caption Wentworth singles Anne out as needing a carriage ride seems so unimportant that you wouldn't creidt it as a sign of his caring about Anne.<br /><br />I agree with everyone that the last 10 minutes are bad, but what bothers me is not so much the running, as the list of odd couinsdences, it's rather Dickonsonian, just as Wentworth comes to see Anne, the whole family arrives, and just as Anne is running to find Wentworth her friend comes up and tells her some news (which is no longer relevent to the story) and just as she's going somewhere else she runs into someone else, I just didn't believe any of it. Of course in order to fit a novel that takes days to absorb into 90 minutes it's I guess the best you can do.<br /><br />------- But wait, while I am not going to recant anything I have said I would like to edit my review, because I have watched this film again, and realized it's not that bad.  First off a movie can not really be so bad if every time it's on tv you flip over and watch it. I have to admit that I must be a but of a snob to have written the above,because this movie is watchable and enjoyable, and of all the Persuasion's I have seen it is the one that creates the best romantic tension between Anne and Wentworth. I have come to really enjoy watching this movie. Now that does not mean I don't lament as we relocate to Bath and the whole thing gets shot to hell, Jane crafted such a beautiful ending and whoever wrote or directed this realized they were running out of time and clearly said, we need to rush this up a ton, and slaughtered Jane's work. I cannot get over that, and tend to flip away once all the running starts, but forgetting that, this is a delightful and romantic movie and you should watch it already.

0307271862|3.0|Thought I might use my review to address some of the more common criticisms i have seen in other reviews, both from critics and on Amazon.    Briefly, The Man From Beijing concerns a mass murder that wipes out the populace of a snowy village in the Swedish hinterlands. From her perch on the judge's bench down country, Mankell's main character - Birgitta Roslin - gains a quick and almost compulsive fascination with the crime, only furthered when she discovers that she is related to the victims by adoption and marriage.     Clues lead Roslin to a shadowy world of Chinese organized crime that exists within the country's government superstructure and extends as far afield as Reno, Nevada and back into the 19th century and the American exploitation of Chinese immigrants/indentured servants in execution of its manifest destiny. But, as Birgitta digs deeper, it becomes clear that even a Chinese titan of the kind that can pull off this kind of global carnage is not secure in a country where tremendous growth and resultant upheaval leave even its elites wondering what is real.    The sheer amount of miles that Mankell travels in traversing the globe (West to East and from the 1850s to the 2000's) leads to the first common criticism I have read. Paraphrasing a Boston Globe review published in the week of the book's release, The Man From Beijing feels like too many books jammed together without a discernable, organic thread.    I disagree with a qualification. I come to Mankell without a background in the Wallander mysteries, so it is easy for me to join Mankell's characters as they leave snowy Sweden for China's teeming and enigmatic metropolis. If anything, it is the Swedish scene of the crime that feels strained. Without a doubt, like so many writing today, Mankell wanted to write a book about China. At heart, The Man From Beijing begs many of the questions that are puzzling global business leaders, policy makers, human rights watchers and others: is this truly going to be\\"the Chinese century,\\" as has been predicted?    Mankell's answer is: maybe. It is impossible to ignore the obvious links between the dalliance into the American West and the perception that China is now beginning to enact its own sort of \\"manifest destiny.\\" Like recent releases, including Charles Cumming's [[ASIN:031255852X Typhoon: A Novel]], Mankell recognizes the growing nation's domestic struggles, both with persistent rural poverty and with an ethnic stew that has yet to congeal to a melting pot.    Similarly, while the stark Swedish village is almost anachronistically pastoral (its cottages do conceal an online day-trading couple along with mostly elderly Swedes), the scenes in China are filled with cranes, skyscrapers and repeated recognitions of the dizzying scale and breakneck growth of the country. He is similarly fascinated by the distinction between the Old World, community-based social structures embodied by the village and the identity-based, stratified, increasingly urbanized world of the 21st century that can only be embodied by China's cities.    Mankell spends not insignificant time considering the inconsistency of Chinese philosophy both on an individual scale - through his main Chinese villain - and, as a matter of national policy. The Chinese apparatchik who is responsible for all of the novel's carnage is somehow indignant that someone he saw fit to murder had been audacious enough to initiate a whisper campaign against him in the event of their death. Similarly, he returns to the ideals of Mao, their modification under Deng, and the evolving Chinese relationship with Communism even as the nation charges toward becoming the globe's largest economy and - perhaps - most active hegemon.    In the end, I found the time and space Mankell traverses a device that served his ends well: the plotting, pacing and the mystery itself are inextricably knotted up with questions of temporality. As he consider Birgitta's life, her history, her relationships and her progress in solving the murders, he returns again and again to the ways in which we are linked to our own past. The same is true of China.     Most artistically, he considers how the major events (either personally or historically) that we identify as lines of demarcation or turning points act - paradoxically - as both the wall that separates us from some distant, distinct \\"past,\\" and as the link to something common and overlapping.    Other tropes are developed in a similarly masterful way and reward close reading (for example: diaries, log books, doodles and handwritten notes appear and reappear to question the reliability and manipulation of oral/cultural mores while prizing the written word as something unchangeable and authentic).    In the end, I can't help but draw the Freudian (and probably too facile) conclusion that here is a novel written by a man who spent his life just outside the sprawl of the Soviet Bloc, now gazing across the expanse of an Asia left so uncertain by the Soviet Union's collapse and the continent's own rapid growth that he can't help but wonder if China will go the way its government is promising (on green tech, on human rights, on economic openness) or another way altogether.     Mankell - through Roslin - cannot help but question again and again whether anything is what it seems. Is this a Potemkin nation? To the criticisms that the book is too sprawling, I would concede that the wind-up in getting to this pay-off pitch is attenuated. But, it is entertaining and engaging.    One last criticism that I think is warranted: in places, the translation is painfully ham-handed. The NYT Sunday Book Review points out several of the cliches that Laurie Thompson resorts to, and I can only conclude - based on the artistry that Mankell shows elsewhere - that these must be translation shortcomings.    In the end, that does not diminish the book much. The plot is spread a bit thin, but again, that is not a fatal detriment becuase the momentumis solid. There is no big mystery payoff, but ultimately Mankell has done what good literary novelists are supposed to do in communicating much of what he wants to say about human nature and the world around clearly, but in an artful and not heavy-handed way.
0394800192|4.0|My daughter asks me to read this story to her every night. It's one of her favorite books, and she knows a good portion of it by heart. The copy we've used is the original print, which was from my own childhood. I decided it was time we upgraded, and although I'm rather impartial to change, I was disappointed that they changed the original colors. It detracts from the original story, and I thought the simplicity of the original illustrations went well with the tale by Dr. Seuss. It was a great book in 1961 and continues to be a great book. You shouldn't change what has been working marvelously.
B001GCUO4S|1.0|For a film that's supposed to be the last of the series, the Final Destination offers nothing new. If you're expecting a clever end to the series with someone finding a way to defeat death without it finally catching up with him or her, think again. While the 3-D doesn't make the weak effects look any better or make us forget that we've seen this all before. No wonder Michael Bay is putting Transformer 3 in 3-D. We'll get the same story and the same actors running around in slow motion and plenty of explosions, but this time in....3-D to try and distract the viewer from the fact that we seen all that before.<br /><br />  The Final Destination just has someone having a vision of himself and his friends dieing at a race car show. The bad accident then really happens, but his friends and others get out safe. But...oh no, death had a plan for them to die too and now they are dieing in the same order that they would have at the show. If I wanted to see a better movie with all that executed well,...I'd watch the first film. Oh no, here's a spoiler, part 3 had a very similar ending and it was done much better in that film.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This is probably one of the very greatest films of all time. It is grand on visuals, it is grand on action, it is grand on music and most importantly, it is grand on story.     Many times I have walked right by this gem of a film in the store. I have picked it up then put it back fearing that it would be a waste of money, as I have never heard of this title nor seen any previews or heard the name Sergio Leone before, although I have been watching The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly for years... Then one day it happened. While alone, dog sitting for a week, I came across this in the owners collection. To put it mildly, I went nuts!!! I completely lost my mind over this film. Being a film crazy (over a thousand films and counting), I had to have this for my personal collection. I could not believe what I had just witnessed. Before this I was completely lost on the art of filmmaking/storytelling. NOW....    Sergio Leone has put all of his genius into this film. From the casting, to the locations, the music, to the props and story. For the greatest experience, ever, I will not ruin the story by telling you the plot. Others reviewers have done that... I will say, if you want to see a film with deep colors, with passionate portrayals and a film that does not mind moving along so masterfully, slow, so that you may achieve the deepest of connections for each of its scenes and characters, this is it. Adding to this already perfect film is Ennio Morricone's absolute best score. The music flows beautifully into one another, is completely different for each character, yet works as a whole. For your listening pleasure, I recommend the expanded italian version of the score. It is divine.     Remember, it is not easy making a film, and even more difficult to make a masterpiece. Sergio Leone has done so. He said, \\"... one year of filmmaking for me, is like three for others...\\" It showed. God Bless Sergio Leone.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|The only thing I have to say is that I am glad I bought this DVD.  I will look at all the food I eat in a whole new way.  This DVD was very well done and full of information that I would never have found otherwise.  Thank God there are people out there who care.  I also think that it was great that OPRAH brought this DVD to light.
0061537969|5.0|I started to read this book with apprehension, since it seemed too cute to be worthwhile as it is narrated from the point of view of a pet dog.  Was I ever wrong. It is one of the most endearing stories I've ever read and I recommend it wholeheartedly!<br />On Enzo's last day on earth, he reviews his life as it intersects with his owner Denny's.<br />Denny's wife Eve was dying of brain cancer (you are told this at the beginning by Enzo, although he is the only one who knows it at the time) and what Eve's parents have in store for Denney, is a nightmare, somewhat softened by the love of his pet, and interpreted through those eyes.<br />What could have been maudlin, for the most part, wasn't.  You will laugh and cry, and if you don't have a dog, well, you just might go out and get one.<br />I would strongly recommend not reading the very last few pages.  That was the only part which was too contrived for me. Other than that, I was deeply moved.
B001UV4XWY|1.0|The sad thing is this film had the potential to be good.  It ends up ruining it with a horrible ending (without spoilers, some things are vaguely implied but it is basically a draw your own conclusion sort of ending).  The story is also not developed properly; too many things are implied and not defined well enough to give you a sense of anything other that you just wasted 2 hours of your time when the movie is over.  If you sat and watched the grass grow for two hours you would feel about the same as if you watched this movie.  Not the worst thing you have ever seen but you definitely don't want to pay for it and there are a whole lot of better things to watch.
B001BZRUR4|4.0|Plot/Storyline: 3 3/4 Stars<br /><br />This novel really grabbed me from the beginning with its smooth narration in the voice of twenty year old Ed Kennedy. The opening scene was tense, yet humorous, maintaining a precarious balance of both.<br /><br />The plot faltered when Ed received the first card. The explanation for why he didn't just drop it in the garbage, or at least treated it as a joke, was just not satisfying enough. I could see no real motivation behind his actions.<br /><br />The storyline moved along at a good clip, slowing down only in a few segments. A couple of the `messages' were really weak, mainly the running girl, but others were definitely worthwhile, at least until the end when all is explained. At that point, the author ruined some of the enjoyment, but only with one or two of the statements. Otherwise, the ending was pretty satisfying.<br /><br />Character Development: 5 Stars<br /><br />This book was worth reading just for the characters of Ed Kennedy and his mates. I love the lazy interaction between him and his friends. Each of them were very shallow throughout most of the book, but later shown to have more depth.<br /><br />The character of Ed's mother was one of my favorites. This was not because I liked her, far from it. It was because she was so believable.<br /><br />Writing Style: 5 Stars<br /><br />As mentioned above, the narrative style used in the novel was excellent. Mr. Zusak did a terrific job of bringing readers into Ed's world with his unique voice. The descriptions were right on target. The dialogue was crisp and enjoyable to read.<br /><br />Editing/Formatting: 5 Stars<br /><br />Both were of professional quality.<br /><br />Rating: PG-16 for Language, Rape, Adult Situations
B002QW7AJY|5.0|I rarely write review for movies since I watch so many.  After reading a couple of neg reviews of Pandorum from other people, I feel that it is underrated.  My reaction is that its an intense kind of horror sci-fi...and I really liked it.  It's a feel that is reminiscent of Alien in that by the end of the film you will want to catch your breath.  I really liked the climax at the end...it was surprising    I won't go into the synopsis of the film as you can read that from other reviewers but I'm kinda glad to add to my library    The blu-ray itself PQ 5/5 and sounds 5/5
B000JMKNV0|4.0|I read this a month ago and I did enjoy it.  I will say that the ending of the book was extremely predictable.  But even so I really did enjoy it.  It did make me want to check out some of his other novels.
B003097B64|3.0|Aping the success of Sony's similarly packaged 5CD box sets, WEA is releasing over FORTY x 5CD \\"Original Album Series\\" mini box sets of their own. Issued only in the UK and Europe, the artists featured stretch from rhythm 'n' blues icons of the 1950s (Ray Charles and Clyde McPhatter with The Drifters) all the way through to Metal And Indie bands of the 2000s (Dokken and Echo & The Bunnymen). For those interested, I've compiled a full listing of titles in the series in the 'comment' section attached to this review (some are superb, some are not).<br /><br />Here's the fine-detail for the LITTLE FEAT set - released Monday 1 March 2010 on Warner Brothers/Rhino 8122 79835 9, \\"Original Album Series\\" 5CD box set breaks down as follows:<br /><br />Disc 1 is \\"Little Feat\\" their 11-track debut album released January 1971 in the USA on Warner Brothers WS 1890 and March 1972 in the UK on Warner Brothers K 46072 (33:30 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 2 is \\"Sailin' Shoes\\" their 11-track 2nd album released May 1972 in the USA on Warner Brothers BS 2600 and in the UK on Warner Brothers K 46156 (38:02 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 3 is \\"Dixie Chicken\\" their 10-track 3rd album released February 1973 in the USA on Warner Brothers BS 2686 and in the UK on Warner Brothers K 46200 (36:48 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 4 is \\"Feats Don't Fail Me Now\\" their 8-track 4th album released September 1974 in the USA on Warner Brothers BS 2784 and in the UK on Warner Brothers K 56030 (34:30 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 5 is \\"The Last Record Album\\" their 8-track 5th album released November 1975 in the USA on Warner Brothers BS 2884 and in the UK on Warner Brothers K 56156. This CD also includes the 9th, 10th and 11th bonus tracks that are on the Eighties CD issue hence the playing time of 39:39 minutes. The tracks are \\"Bonus Announcement\\", \\"Don't Bogart That Joint [Live]\\" and \\"A Apolitical Blues [Live]\\".<br /><br />ARTWORK/PACKAGING:<br />The five single card sleeves reflect the 'original' front and rear US LP artwork (the gatefold of \\"Sailin' Shoes\\" is unfortunately not reproduced and the rear of the 1st album is changed too). However, there is an odd addition to the way these card sleeves have been presented that seems to go right across the entire series of 40+ titles. Each front sleeve is now 'bordered' with a color - in this issue its brown for \\"Little Feat\\", orange for \\"Sailin' Shoes\\" (and so on) and the label on the CD then reflects that color code. I mention this because Rhino are usually sticklers for detail and would in the past have used the original vinyl label designs like they did in the 'Encore' series (a green Warner Brothers label for \\"Dixie Chicken\\", the Burbank Trees label for \\"The Last Record Album\\" and so on), it would have been more appropriate, but alas not here...<br /><br />There's no inserts or booklet either and the outer card box is disappointingly flimsy too (the Sony ones are chunky and glossy - they're stronger). Worse, there appears to be no site to download track details from (as there is with the Sony issues). Having said all that, the card sleeves still look cool once out of the box and it's nice to see the original artwork used (it makes a big difference on the Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Paul Butterfield, Dionne Warwick and Clyde McPhatter & The Drifters rear sleeves - beautiful original album artwork). But that's small compensation, because the really bad news is the opportunity missed in the sound department...<br /><br />SOUND:<br />Some CD sites selling these sets seemed to have automatically 'presumed' that each is \\"digitally remastered\\", but it categorically does NOT state that on the outer box or any of the card sleeves or discs - and rather too conveniently - neither website for Rhino USA or UK has any info on the series at all. But what's not hard to discern is what your ears are actually telling you.<br /><br />Like most fans I have the crappy Eighties CD issues just to have the music and these 2010 versions seem to be pretty muchthe same. To put this into an audio context, when you compare the 2000 \\"Hotcakes & Outtakes\\" genuine remasters of say \\"Two Trains\\", \\"Willin'\\", \\"Roll Um Easy\\", \\"Rock And Roll Doctor\\" and especially \\"Long Distance Love\\" (lyrics above), the sound quality is infinitely better on the Box Set versions - truly gorgeous stuff.  The sound quality here is merely good at best (maybe better in some places), but it's absolutely not the upgrade fans were hoping for on 'all' of the albums.<br /><br />To sum up - with Rhino announcing redundancies in their reissue departments (everything's going away from hard copy to digital downloads) and the slightly slapdash feel of these boxes, you can't help but field a depressing thought - this is a truly great reissue label just chucking stuff at the wall to sell it. A musical maverick going out with a whimper rather than a bang - flogging us what they 'know' is more of the same old crud just with a prettier lick of paint. Only a few years ago, Rhino could be relied upon to deliver us superlative reissues every time - but with these and the rubbish \\"Flashback\\" series of last year (repackaged 80's dross CDs) - not anymore it seems...<br /><br />If the Rickie Lee Jones, Chaka Khan, Chris Rea and George Benson boxes are the same (non remasters), then I'll not bother at all with any more in this series...and that's just plain depressing.<br /><br />Three stars out of five - at a pinch.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Im so happy I purchased this DVD it has shed so much light on whats going on in the meat industry. All the deception that we are not even aware of. How our meat and chicken is being mass produced for the sake of making more money and how our health is not even an issue to these big corporations. If you want to know whats really going on in the meat industry get this DVD after seeing this you will never eat meat the same again.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|Could it be? Is it possible that the best/safest place for our castaways is on The Island with The Others, Smokey, magnetic & time anomalies? Is it possible they shouldn't leave? That's the question Season 4 asks as life on the Island gets worse, but it's shown that life off the Island is even worse. Make no mistake about it, season 4 is quite different than the seasons proceeding it as the story starts building towards something, and the sci-fi elements of it get that much stranger. And oh the complexity!<br /><br />Highlight Episodes:<br />The Economist<br />The Constant<br />The Shape of Things to Come<br />There's No Place Like Home<br /><br />Naturally with the more story-driven nature of the season, the characters are kind of pushed aside, but that's not totally on the fault of the series. While we are given new characters to get to know, we've already know inside and out the regular castaways. And probably the biggest fault of the \\"flash-forwards\\" is that we don't really get that much character development. We might see a new side of Kate, but it's Kate & it's a logical progression for the character I'm not exactly sure we needed to see. Sure, it sets up the later season, but I'm not convinced it really works in tangent with this season. It doesn't hurt the character development like Season 2 did, but it doesn't really help and/or do anything for them either. The lone exception to this however is probably Ben Linus, who progresses significantly then what we've seen of him previously. Plus, Michael Emerson could be doing nothing and I'd still be fascinated with him & his character.<br /><br />But again, Season 4 is focused primarily on the story. Sure, it may be slow towards the middle of the season, but there's just so many great moments here. The whole Freighter storyline is played well, and the foreshadowing and setting-up in this season is all compelling. And what's best is that besides being just fascinating to watch, it's also original, which is a great thing to say when a show is in its 4th year. I mean, I know \\"The Constant\\" has been praised to no end, but the episode just works so well as both a sci-fi and character piece. Make no mistake about it, an episode featuring Desmond is always a good one, and \\"The Constant\\" is one of the series' best.<br /><br />Overall, Season 4 is a thrilling ride, and it's worth the trek if only for \\"The Constant\\" and 'No Place Like Home.' It's not the best season, and it may not move the characters along as much as I would like, but its primary function is foreshadowing and setting up the events to come. It has so many great moments, both story & character-wise, making Season 4 well worth the trip.<br /><br />Real Score: 4.5/5ear.

B0025KVLTW|1.0|I grant it was my fault. I should have checked to see if there were any non remastered copies of the Beatles Magical Mystery Tour available.  I have learned my lesson. I had bought an entire set of Beatles CD's while living in Germany ten years ago including a numbered limited edition of the white album (1 million copies). These were beautiful records (actually Cd's) and even though they were not vinyl for CD's they were fantastic. However, they were lost in transit when I came home. I have been slowly rebuilding my collection but the quality of the American versions are horrible and SIR--Ha-HA-- George Martin has done a disservice to us all in his remastering. He has cleaned up things like when Paul's voice doesn't quite make that note on Lovely Rita and his voice breaks, a beloved moment for me, now gone.  However the worst yet is my recently purchased Magical Mystery tour. It's Bass is so over done and the highs are pumped up. It sounds like some group trying to be the Beatles and almost but not quite pulling it off.  It is all shiny and new and polished but nothing like the original.  It also seems to be a tradition to rip off Americans on Beatles recordings. I really wish I had my european Beatles CD's back. The were un-remastered and sounded like the records I grew up with. Why george Martin felt he had to clean up these recordings I don't know. It is the biggest sin since the evil munchkin felt the Beatles needed a wall of sound for their Let it Be album. But for me The Magical mystery is the worse by far. Do yourselves a favor and try to find used CDs for all your Beatles recordings from now on and especially avoid this one it is the worst of the lot so far. Why Sir Martin, Why? You would never had gotten away with it if John was still here.  What's next removing Revolution #9 from the white album because it's odd and most people don't like it? But to be on point. It just doesn't sound as good as my old CD and in no way sounds anything like the album I usedto have.     Hope this helps.    P.S. Does anyone know the difference between enhanced and remastered?? Thanks.    I hope someone wakes up and reisues these recordings as is.
B001UV4XWY|3.0|What makes the premise of this intriguing film so satisfying is its simplicity.  A middle class couple facing financial difficulties is presented with a choice: push a button and they will be given a million dollars in cash ... and, someone they don't know will die.  The problem is that the filmmakers develop an overly elaborate and inexplicably bizarre back story packed with visually intriguing ideas that never really go anywhere in order to account for why they were given the choice in the first place.  It's not that it doesn't make sense, and it's not (as another reviewer suggests) that I wasn't paying attention or came into it expecting something else ... I get it and I get what Richard Kelly was going for and I actually kind of enjoyed the film all along but it didn't all add up and for many elements of the film the more you think about them the more hokey they begin to seem.  Like the three watery portals that, at one point, James Marsden's character is presented with and told he must choose one and enter, with an ominous warning about the consequences of choosing incorrectly.  Sure, they looked cool, but what was the point?  It's not clear whether he chose correctly or what was really at stake and he just ends up somewhere else all wet and confronted with a more important question.  Unlike some of the other \\"tests\\" that are given throughout the film, this one didn't have any kind of clear moral implications.<br /><br />It's a fun watch, though; it's creepy and atmospheric, and kept me intrigued for the most part throughout.  The look of the film captures the early '70s nicely.  I liked the deliberate references to Sartre's infernal classic [[ASIN:0679725164 No Exit]] - and for a while it felt like the aim of the film was to reinvent the themes of that play on a larger scope.  I also thought it was clever (even if a bit cynical, and with shades of misogyny) that the choice represented by the box was delivered to a woman, who ended up pressing the button but shared the consequences with her husband, and it was hard not to see the red round button as a kind of update to Eden's apple.  It's just that in the end all of the metaphysical and moral weight that the film had managed to build and sustain starts to sag, and the mystery that felt like an elaborate theological and existential puzzle is mostly resolved (with a few deliberately loose ends) and you are left with an overly baroque and even somewhat silly but unfunny cosmic joke taken way too seriously (of course, that's not a bad description of life, the universe and everything from a certain point of view ... maybe that of Sartre).<br /><br />Still, I don't want to leave on that note, since it strikes me as too harsh - I'm being harsh because my hopes were pretty high.  Richard Kelly's got a lot of potential and has some great ideas and knows how to translate them to the screen - it's just he has too many ideas and apparently no one there to help him eliminate the excessive -- the best scripts find a way to deliver maximum intensity and reflection by the simplest means.  This one, at least, is much more tight than the at times brilliant but mostly incoherent [[ASIN:B0011VIO3W Southland Tales]] but lacks the simplicity of the first incarnation of [[ASIN:B00005V3Z4 Donnie Darko]] (I thought the director's cut of Darko showed tendencies of the problem I'm describing here: once he starts to explain the \\"physics\\" behind the intriguing concept, it starts to get hokey and over-elaborate).  This latest film is well worth watching and I thought it was quite entertaining, but more on par with an overlong but decent episode of X-Files or Twilight Zone (like the one it's based on) than the intensely existential science fiction minor masterpiece it might have been.the consequences with her husband, and it was hard not to see the red round button as a kind of update to Eden's apple.

1416562605|5.0|You know this book will make you laugh from the first entry (not exactly a sentence): \\"For the desk of His Excellency Wen Jiabao; The Premier's Office; Beijing; Capital of the freedom-loving Nation of China.\\" It comes from the India narrator, Balram, who describes his Horatio Alger-style rise from poverty to entrepreneurshiup for the edification of a Premier who needs to encourage similar rises in his own country. What's important about Belram, who often refers to the 21C as the \\"Age of the Yellow and Brown Men,\\" is that you believe him. People in India and China are creating, manufacturing, using their heads to provide legitimately helpful services. Meanwhile, what's done in the US? Bankers, Wall St. manipulators, and politicians play weird little games with money, like creating derivatives, until they bring the country to its knees. Bill Gates is one of the few who stood between us and anihilation, and as the late Nien Cheng said, \\"He would have been Knighted in England.\\" Here the government harrassed him for years with antitrust suits - our other big industry. But \\"White Tiger\\"  isn't polemic, so I shouldn't make it sound like it is. It's funny, exciting, and full of story -  murder, sex, what have you. Many books are enjoyable reads, but this one truly is a MUST-read.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This goes to show how amazing Michael Jackson still was. I went to see this 3 times in the cinema and have watched it more times than that since I purchased the dvd, it's brilliant and a great tribute to have and shows how brilliant the 'This Is It' tour would have been. It's a must have for everyone, not just fans, to show the brilliance of Michael Jackson.
B002QB1910|5.0|I think for me the lesson learned is to listen to the music for yourself. I read a couple reviews and heard a couple friend's opinions who said the music wasnt great on Rated R. A few months after release 'Hard' was released as a single and it convinced me to buy the cd. I have been a listener but never really a fan of rihanna. I didnt buy her first two releases, and bought Good Girl Gone Bad. This cd far exceeds Good Girl Gone Bad! It's so raw, personal, touching, and groove worthy. The first song that got me into this cd was Photographs featuring Will.I.Am. I dont want to describe this song this way, but it had Madonna's  second half of the music album vibe to it. Then it went from there to Rockstar 101, which in my opinion is far superior to Hard, which in itself is a hard task. Firebomb seems very personal, and you can hear the introspective in her voice. Whether intentional or not, Rihanna was definitely feeling these songs. She just keeps getting better.
B002NVTBOU|5.0|Buika comes from Palma de Mallorca. She was raised there the only person of African descent in a neighborhood of gypsies, who taught her the traditional \\"cante\\" flamenco. She likes to mix styles -flamenco and coplas with jazz, rumba, soul. Her smoky voiced vocals ring with emotion and she moves around the rhythm like a good jazz singer does.  In this album she is backed by a killer group led by Cuban piano virtuoso Chucho Valdes. (Valdes first came to US attention when Dizzy Gillespie came back from a jazz tour to Cuba and raved about the Cuban jazz ensemble, Irakere, which was fronted by Valdes, trumpeter Arturo Sandoval and saxophonist-clarinetist Paquito D'Rivera.  This is an excellent album and easily accessible. It's great music to listen to on a long drive.
B001AQR3E4|4.0|While this movie is slightly long, it surely does not drag. I would recommend this movie to most people.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|This box set has been a joy to my life. The punch of Ringo's drums. The directness of the musical expression. The clarity of sound. The surprises (Paul's alternate fade-out vocal snippet from 'Got to Get You into My Life', for example).    I really enjoyed the alternate versions of the white album, but I am snippy at having to duplicate Past Masters for three songs. If 'Old Brown Shoe' weren't one of my favourite Beatles tracks, I'd have hesitated. For a moment.    I was initially very cynical about this re-release; the missed opportunity for digital downloads just the latest of a number of poor decisions from Apple, IMHFO. But I'm a Beatlemanic, so I had to have it. (I was introduced to the Beatles by my older siblings, more or less from the cradle.) With that caveat, I'd heartily recommend the Mono Box. If you're a true fan, this will either blow your mind or bring back some beautiful memories. The music hasn't sounded this good in decades.
B000PHOY0A|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I had first read another book written by him after this book called \\"Collapse\\" which is also excellent.  \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" has to be the most profound book I have ever read, though it often reads like a novel instead of a book of so much fact and history.  Many nights I couldn't put it down and read for 5 or 6 hours.  This book provides a deep, well researched, scientifically supported narrative that helps you, the reader, understand why the civilization of the world is setup the way it is.  It helps you understand why it was Europeans who conquered the New World instead of Native Americans conquering Europe.  Though the book doesn't quite make the claim that the way civilization developed in the world was inevitable, it certainly helps you understand the advantages and disadvantages of all our important historical societies and why one was so much more likely to be a conquering society instead of a conquered one.<br /><br />It is not too elaborate praise to say that this is the most important book I have ever read and very deserving of the Pulitzer Prize it won.  It has helped me understand what the world is; why the world is; and what forces will be the ones that will most likely shape humanities' future.

B002XMGGJM|1.0|I did not like this, not a title I'd buy. I get wanting to reap revenge on the thugs that killed his family, but the level he took things to was way over the top and that made me not feel for the father at all and also borders on unbelievable. Killing or endangering the lives of innocents is unacceptable to me. Sure kill the two responsible for the crime b/c our legal system is too weak, but it should end there. I dont like the movie b/c it's a Richie Rich story of a brainiac father who apparently has access to military grade weaponry. Didn't like the ending either
B00001W9G0|5.0|This movie was NOT what I was expecting, and that was a good thing. Being in the movie business, I really avoided this film for a number of years. But finally watched it because I enjoy the work of Sidney Pollack. I must say this film ran the entire range of emotions. For one thing, many parts of this film were boring as hell!!!!! I can tolerate a great deal, but certain aspects of this movie sucked!     Having said that, I went through a relationship similar to the one of the picture, and THAT aspect of the film is very true to real life. Two people wanting something that they cannot have, which is each other. It's very deep when it comes to that aspect of life, and I think that part of the film is what makes it so powerful.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I discovered Leonard Cohen when he appeared on PBS recently. I am 66 and somehow missed being exposed to his music until now!  Well, I absolutely fell in love with his voice, his band, and his backup singers. I like his low voice.  I bought another CD Set of his when he was younger, \\"Essential Leonard Cohen\\" after reading the reviews on here and was disappointed. When he doesn't have the band and backup singers, his younger, higher voice just doesn't carry the songs like his new performance does.        So now, what I wish for is another new CD production of his current voice, band and singers, performing his songs that aren't on the \\"Live in London\\" set.  From the \\"Essential Leonard Cohen\\" CDs, I gather he started singing in his lower registers gradually over the years. So, for me, he is perfect right now and I wish I had known about him when he was in Kansas City the fall of '09. I don't go to concerts, but I definitely would if he comes back touring the United States again.
B000001GQC|5.0|...despite being performed by an Italian conductor with a British orchestra and choir. I fell in love with this version of \\"Alexander Nevsky\\" the first time I heard it and return to it again and again, despite the claims of other interpreters. The  word \\"cantata\\" conjures up a rather more prim and sedate impression than applies to this epic score; this is music which needs grabbing by the scruff of the neck and I am pleased to observe that here the LSO seem inspired, as they often were, by Abbado's direction. I am particularly impressed by the way they capture a different mood and atmosphere to characterise the warring parties: the Crusaders sound suitably barbaric and alien such that the Western listener will find himself emotionally loyal to the Russian patriots, rather than its assorted enemies, whether or not they intone Latin and call themselves Christians. I am not a Russian speaker but the London Symphony Chorus sound convincing to me and I do not think their attack and energy can be faulted. Some might prefer a younger, more vulnerable-sounding singer than Elena Obratsova, but her beautiful, haunting singing as singing per se is mightily impressive. To me, she embodies both the soul of a nation in mourning and the proud grief of a single woman who will die an old maid.<br /><br />The searing, keening wails which evoke the devastation caused by the Mongol hordes in the opening bars are marvellously chilling; similarly, the fear and tension Abbado generates in the opening of \\"The Battle on the Ice\\" is quite extraordinary; you do not need to have seen Eisenstein's film to picture these scenes. The immediate emotional impact and appeal of this music make it an ideal introduction to Prokofiev, all the more so when coupled with two such contrasting works as the \\"Scythian\\" and \\"Lieutenant Kij&eacute;\\" suites, here played superbly (the wry, gentle charms of the latter serving to balance the wildness of the other two works). This is music which transcends any crude attempt to categorise it merely as a film score or propaganda. Most preceding reviews chime with mine; I simply do not understand the one or two dissenting voices who find it \\"bloodless\\" and label the sound \\"a little lifeless\\". If anything, the DG analogue sound is a little over-bright but it matches the young Abbado's taut, thrilling interpretation.ttempt to categorise it merely as a film score or propaganda.

B00365YVRO|5.0|A classic Sade cd.  If one just listens to the lyrics, you will hear so much growth form an artist who has observed love and the daily struggles of human life.  Her story is sang over a bed of powerfully emotional music.  You have to get your eye, soul and heart into her music to appreciate it.  With art, make no comparisons to past projects, if you do that, you have truly missed the point.  People who do this have a hard time accepting growth. Favorite tracks 1,2,9,10 a great cd and in heavy  rotation in my car!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Possibly my favorite Disney film of all time! Belle is witty, curious, and fun with a bold edge that makes you root for her throughout the film. This story, a classic, retells how a bold, bookworm beauty managed to tame the cruel heart of a prince enchanted into a beast. Colorful animation sequences and wonderful songs bring the story to life on the screen. The backgrounds are stunning, each hand painted with oils and each holding that special detail only a brush can capture. All of the characters are fun to follow, especially the blond triplets that adore Gaston, and even Gaston's sidekick is a riot that takes a bit away from the serious tone of the tale. If you're having girls, I suggest buying this! I still love it! :D
B001CQONKY|4.0|I bought it for my sister and I have not received any complaint so far. So I think she likes it.
B000F8O35U|5.0|As a girl, I adored this film! Now, I still love it! Ariel's spunky self, Eric's charming naivete, and even Ursula's cruel influence all make this film a keeper! A stunning Disney classic that features singing to develop characters, shift scenes, and change tone all told in the classic 2-d animated style. Every background is handpainted, all the characters are hand drawn, and best of all, Ariel is a strong role model for young girls. Eric plays the role of damsel in this film, giving Ariel plenty of time to try and win his affection through her rescues. The film focuses on the relationship between Ariel and Eric, though they don't officially go anywhere until the end of the film. But, it is well worth the wait! Hilarious sequences starring Scuttle, Sebastian, and Flounder along with some of Ariel's misunderstood concepts about the human world. Well worth the buy!
B0035MNSPY|4.0|When I originally wrote this review, I may have been giving it unfair negativity due to the bands past 3 albums.    After listening to this album over the course of a few weeks, there is no doubt Mechanize is on par with Demanufacture and some songs right there with Soul of a New Machine.    They finally have gotten a hard edge back.    This album is the first one I have heard since or at least parts of it that actually has a death metal sound and not like the cheese ball tough guy metal they were playing in their past few albums.    The drums are good and the guitar actually has some leads, thank god. Most of the songs don't just grind, double bass and repeat.  Their best songs on this album are the ones that leave you guessing as to what is next, the more death metal they play the better they are.    Stand out Songs:    1. Designing the Enemy (Has that Soul of a New Machine sound.  The clean vocals are not trying to be fancy which is good, the hard vocals are very death metal which is perfect.  Music is top notch.    2. Final Exit  The vocals are not cheese ball for one of their slow songs and the music in this song is excellent.    3. Mechanize  Very Demanufacture.    4. Fear Campaign  Very Demanufacture.    5. Christploitation  I really like the intro and how it builds off the tone of it.    Worst Songs    1. Industrial Discipline  Another one of the grind rinse and repeat songs. No real lead or melody carrying the song like the others.      Overall this is a good start to reviving this band overall.  Really good purchase for once.
B001AQT11M|5.0|A wonderful film full of charm and wit. Disney's first ever princess that started the entire Princess line stars in Snow White. The story veers off from the darker counterparts and doesn't include Snow's mother like the traditional stories do, rather it plunges you into the depths of the stepmother's rivalry with Snow White for the title of most beautiful. Each attempt on the Queen's part to kill Snow White fails until the apple, whose poisoned cheek sends the poor girl through a ringer.<br />Snow White is a naive child, being bred in the palace, and she doesn't quite comprehend all the dangers around her. This is both a weakness of hers, as well as a strength that makes her lovable. As a feminist, I think that she teaches girls a valuable lesson: looks aren't everything and be careful who you take candy from. Snow White has a happy ending, but that's all I'm saying because you really have to watch it yourself to experience it.
0887307280|2.0|The author's 'great insight' is that most people who start small businesses  are technicians, i.e., they understand the mechanics of their trade but not how to   run a business. Fair enough. The solutions offered up, however, are simplistic,   general and formulaic. (Any McDonald's franchise pack has more useful information  in it.) There really is nothing of substance in it.    The E Myth is written in the conversational style of a self-help book, in a   nauseatingly self satisfied way. The author also creates his own language   and terminology, as if he had discovered a new and exciting science, and what makes this   especially annoying (not to mention cynical) is that the language is obviously specific   to his consultancy. A deeply irritating book.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is something I have wanted my entire life - every last official Beatles album ever released.  Of course there are 1 or 2 discs I could live without, but to be honest I got this more than a month ago and I still haven't stopped listening to it.  The Beatles will forever be the greatest band to grace this world in my mind, though eventually someone better may come along (even though it still hasn't happened after almost 50 years...)  Even if half of the group is gone from us, they will always live on through the music and the emotion it inspires in us all.
B000002J29|4.0|This is a TREMENDOUS CD and anyone purchasing it who has any sense of Progressive Rock will D-E-F-I-N-I-T-E-L-Y LOVE IT!  A friend gave me this to listen to in 2000, and I have been listening to it ever since!  The only song on the CD I'm not crazy about is Lamb....just does not do it for me.  But Squonk, RA&B, Carpet Crawlers, Firth of Fifth, Afterglow, Supper's Ready all send shivers down my spine.  A Masterpiece.
B001F290E4|2.0|Seal is great, but the music all sounds like some crappy machine work. Drums the worst.
B000002I6T|5.0|This album is best listened to as the sun sets over the deserts of Arizona or better yet on the Bright Angel Trail at the bottom of the Grand Canyon when the cliffs walls flash like copper shield from their mineral deposits.    It's melodies and haunting compostion evoke powerful memories nearly 40 years after its intial release.  Take it with you on your next road trip and enjoy this audio gem as it's meant to be heard.

1401219268|5.0|Watchmen takes the comic genre to an entirely new level. The intricate plot and creative story telling mesh perfectly to give the reader a great expierience. While it does take a little while to get going, once it does it becomes a great read and a memorable one at that. The artwork helps paint the picture of Alan Moore's best writing. This is a must read for anyone who is in to comics or is curious about them. Buy it today!
B001ED7C58|1.0|I never got the item and was in contact with the seller until the end. I sent emails to get the tracking number seller had placed on the item to get the post office involved, but I never got a reply back.
B002U6CJCE|5.0|I'm usually not a fan of sequels, especially after watching Universal Soldier The Return. However this rendition is easily more entertaining than previous films. Both Van Damme and Andrei Arlovski were fantastic in this film; infact I felt Arlovski had better screen presences than Dolph Lundgren. The action and fight scenes in this film are easily on par with any high budget action film. Unlike a lot of the straight DVD action movies out there, the fight choreography in this film was close to perfect. The director wisely used wide angle lenses during the action scenes giving U.S.R a raw, realistic feel throughout the film. Unlike a lot of Van Dammes previous direct to DVD releases this film delivers.

B002GY9F9K|3.0|This DVD series is a definite must-see for fans of Terry Goodkind's Legend of the Seeker series. The plot is pretty loosely based on the books, but I've definitely enjoyed watching the characters come to life on the screen. The acting's a bit weak to be honest, but I'd still recommend the purchase.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Good master copy. Great acting and script. Love the soundtrack. Only watched some of the featurettes but this is a great film for Sergio Leone fans.
1594488916|3.0|2.5 stars. The majority of people who are intrigued by this title probably love books, therefore, read it to satisfy your curiosity. However, I found the writing to be adequate but uninspired, the personality of the author drab and prissy and the guy who loves books not all that interesting. The thing I most disliked was the plethora of banal connections made presented as cosmic ironies (for instance, between the title of a book and the thief's situation). Also, the author repeats herself A LOT. What I liked most was gaining insight into the world of book collecting.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary is a must see for everyone.  If I could afford it I would buy a copy for every member of my family and all of my friends!    Eye-opening! It has changed my thinking completely.  I am considering becoming a vegan.  And I am now checking every food item I buy and if it is made by Monsanto Corporation I will NOT buy it!!    I am telling everyone I know about this documentary and sharing what I learned from it.
B002SF9YUM|2.0|I thought the only good things the movie had was a young, untrained Robert Pattinson  the the location of Spain. It was a small budget film and it shows. It didn't show enough of the works of Lorca or Dali. I thought I would have liked to see from what well Salvadore Dali sprang from.  All in all, not a waste of time, but it could have been better.
B001SN78JO|4.0|I am a Jim Carrey fan although many of his films are too over the top for me. However, Yes Man was great and I especially like the fact that the version I bought had the widescreen and the full screen versions on the same DVD and I didn't need all the extras that many DVD movies have. I prefer full screen movies and find them hard to find. This film reminded me of the Jim Carrey i enjoyed in Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar....a most enjoyable movie.
0061537969|4.0|I had really high expectations for The Art of Racing in the Rain and I can't exactly say this book met my expectations. But, it was such a quick read and was indeed a cute book, so I will recommend it.<br /><br />If you're a dog lover, there's no doubt you'll have an appreciation for this book. Enzo's thought process is adorable and I think realistic (if you believe dogs really are capable of thoughts). I absolutely loved this book's concept.<br /><br />I'm not into car racing, so I had a hard time connecting to that part of the book, but it did fit well and made sense. There were parts of the book that I was really angry about and that I thought were pretty unrealistic (the harshness with which Denny's in-laws treat him). But I took it all with a grain of salt and flew through the book. Definitely a cute read, but just warning you it may be a little heavier than you think!
B00204AA0O|4.0|this one sounded too much like the last album like a cheap immitation of her own work.  little dissapointing but still regina.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This move is a must see for everyone.  It has opened my eyes about the food industry in America.  Since seeing this movie I have only been buying organic food.  I am aware of what I am eating whereas before it was never a second thought.  I particularly am aware of meat products and how the animals are raised.  I will watch this movie again and am sharing it will all my friends and family.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I'm quite a big Austen fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I've read all of her books, and seen all of the movies, and this one was one of the best adaptations I've seen.  I thought they did a great job bringing Miss Emma Woodhouse to the screen.  Every single character is played so well, I felt myself being pulled into the movie.  They did a great job casting perfect people to play each role.  If you're an Austen fan, whether a huge fan, or dabbler, give this one a chance.  You'll love it!

Fascinating photos backed up with captivating narrative. I feel like I've traveled the world, met dozens of families and enjoyed a peek into their life all while sitting on my couch. It never occurred to me we could learn so much about people by learning about their diet. Yet by focusing on diet, we then learn how they shop and how individuals become a family in the process of food preparation.     You two make a pretty wonderful team.

B002UD56I6|5.0|I expected this to be a sappy homage to Michael Jackson, given all of the hype about his death.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was a very objective documentary about the preparations for the concert and it really displayed an artist's dedication to getting things done well and right.  It also showed some sides of Michael Jackson that I don't think much of the public is aware of these days.  He was creative, a perfectionist, and but stern at times.  I recommend you see this--especially in Blu-Ray--to get a new perspective of how MJ became and was a star.
0937381888|5.0|You literally could brew your first beer within a day of having this book in your hand.  It is well thought out in terms of layout and material presentation.  It gives you the basics, a list of \\"do this, then this\\" instructions, and then tells you why you are doing it.  The level of technical detail increases in each section and is easy to comprehend.    There is information here that can guide a pure novice though your first beer, and info that will help experienced all grain brewers as well.    If you were going to buy one book to learn how to brew at home, then this is that book.  You will (I did) make a good beer your first try (better than most commercial beers), and if you use this book as a reference every beer you make will be better.    If you have any interest at all in home brewing, regardless of your experience level, you will learn somehting from this book.
B002VWONB2|5.0|This story is one of the greatest of filmlands romance movies. It has many of the most memorable lines ever said on screen and it has influenced everything that came later. It is a story of a cynical antihero who must sacrifice for what's right and the message was aimed directly at the American public who were then engaged in total war. This movie is a true classic movie but that doesn't mean it's boring; after all it has Bogart and other greats in it like CLaude Rains, Ingrid Bergman, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre.  Of course the line 'play it again sam\\" was never actually said in this movie but this movie has been played into the hearts of anyone who enjoys classic romance films.  The print on blu ray looks spotless! It's a example of what needs to be done before a older movie is put on blu ray. It actually looks almost as good as a masterprint here; with NO LINES, spots, and other defects. This looks alot better than what the critirean collection did with 'The third man\\" another black and white landmark movie. Although I would recommend buying that one if you can get a cheap copy.  The blu ray also has many other features including a tv version of the movie from the 1950's. Plus A story of Bogart who came from a uppermiddleclass family and was a brilliant actor by any standards.  Anyways This movie is one of the eternal romance movies of all and it's wartime themes of sacrifice and desperation still appeal to the average person struggling to do the right thing in a tough world.  After all watching this movie for the first time is like 'the beginning of a beautiful friendship\\"  as the character Rick would say.
B001FB4VZS|4.0|I really like this series, i been fallow since first season and every one of them are great. About this season i really like how klark keep dealing with the part of been a hero, many choices have to do and always there is a consecuence for each one of them. This time they show more closer to the original series, many characters are introduce this time, and everything is gettin in place. I hope you liked it and enjoy it.
1591396190|4.0|Great read and excellent approach to strategy. One thing the book overlooked was the importance of  competition in business. It's great being an exclusive provider of products and services, but competition doesn't  need to be irrelevant for a company to be successful. Competition is actually a tool for creating blue oceans themselves; without it there would be no need to create blue oceans. I think the book has a lot to offer for getting buy in on new strategies from crossfire decision making in the high corporate ranks.
B00144VBBS|5.0|If your like me and love Toby Keith, then you'll love this collection. The first CD alone was worth the purchase price.
B003102JDM|2.0|We have the usual off-beat very distinct characters. There is not much of a plot though and the movie moves really slow.  The ending is a let down without really bringing the movie to a conclusion.  I think the writers were trying to make a fable set in the 1960's. There are minor plot lines that don't come together in the end or lead to a climax.  This movies moves as slow as the main characters life.  Larry Gopnik's life is just a series of lower lows with nothing to make us care or have much interest in his life.  I like the Coen Brothers but I just don't get this movie.
B0036B8MZU|5.0|WARNING:<br /><br />This movie has intense depictions of graphic violence, language, sexuality, and nudity.  It is recommended for a mature audience (ages 18 and older).<br /><br />INTRO<br /><br />This gripping tale of Spartacus, the legendary 1st century Gladiator during the rule of Rome is a spectacular series featured on Starz.  The story develops with our hero, a Thracian warrior, enlisted by the Romans to fight against the Getae.  Andy Whitfield plays the warrior who leads a mutiny against the legion's leader, Claudius Glaber.  Upon being captured, his wife is sold into slavery while Thracian warrior is sentenced to die in the arena against 4 gladiators.  We battles the gladiators and wins with the crowds cheering for his victory.  The scene is a dynamic and rather gory display of violence, taken to the highest level.  The sheer brutality depicted in the finale of the 1st episode and demonstrated throughout the subsequent episodes is a trademark of the entire miniseries.  Taken in by Lentulus Batiatus (who inherited a school of Gladiators from his father), he names the warrior Spartacus, after a Thracian King.  It is the transformation over the course of the series whereby Spartacus is trained from Warrior to Gladiator.  Doctore (played by Peter Mensah, who played the messenger in 300), a former gladiator, trains the group of men in a rigid and disciplined manner.<br /><br />THE STORY<br /><br />The quest for Spartacus' freedom is what motivates him to continue to fight, in alliance with his \\"Master\\" Batiatus.  Batiatus' wife battles infertility and is in support of her husband, every step of the way - while pleasing herself with the school's prime fighter, Crixus, in various rendevous with him.<br /><br />The story and character development help weave the story of this Gladiator who goes on to lead a slave uprising against the Romans.  As the story progresses, we see the alliance that Spartacus has made with his Dominus, Batiatus.  Multiple stories are intertwined as the characters progress throughout the series.  Does Lucretia continue her affairs with Crixus to the end?  How about Crixus' fascination with Naevia, the slave closest to Lucretia?  The brotherhood between Spartacus and Batiatus show the human side of Spartacus, as they train together.  The conniving Ashur is a snakelike metaphor who interweaves his life between the training grounds and the city, doing his will for Batiatus.  The sly Ilithyia befriends Lucretia but how does their friendship endure through the plight of Batiatus' thirst for power in Capua.  Solonius the ever suave opponent of Batiatus frequently vies for Lucretia's attention while plotting with Ashur, in the darkness.  Does Sura reunite with her Spartacus?  Will Crixus regain the glory of \\"Champion of Capua\\", and how does Doctore aid in Crixus' ascent back to the crowds' favor?  Each episode is compelling, and the acting is superb.  The odd references to sexuality made by Batiatus' experiences with getting the lower hand in many events is somewhat puzzling, and I hope that the Blu-ray version gives insight to the history between Batiatus and Solonius.  The true love/hate relationship we have for Batiatus as an underachieving owner of a Ludis, while plotting to gain money and power behind the scenes, shows a dynamic character portrayed by John Hannah (Best known from The Mummy Series).  Many of the key characters are British or from New Zealand.  Viva Blanca who plays Ilithyia is a beautiful actress that we just love to hate.<br /><br />DETAILS<br /><br />The movie is in the same vein (sorry, in this case, artery) as 300 and the Gladiator, but makes those movies look tame in comparison.<br /><br />Cinematography is left to rendered landscapes and simple sets with emphasis in the Villa, Ludis and town.  The visuals are well done and the heroes and heroines are detailed with authentic appearing costumes, blood, scars and physiques (feminine and masculine) in a consistent form.  Language of theactors is more a reflection of their native tongue, I surmise, versus the actual accents by which the Romans, Gauls and Thracians spoke.<br /><br />Each episode has stunning fight scenes in the arenas or at the Batiatus villa with vicious brutality, gore and violence.  The violence is so extreme, at times, that other movies and shows pale in the comparison from the liters of blood that is spilled from the characters.  Almost every episode has scenes of sexuality and nudity.<br /><br />The last episode is an amazing, fast-paced and graphically gory conclusion to one of the best mini-series that I have ever watched on cable television.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />This movie is a definite must see and must have for your Blu-ray collection.  I have pre-ordered it and it will become part of the Pantheon of \\"Man Movie Night\\"!!!sus the actual accents by which the Romans, Gauls and Thracians spoke.

B000EULJLU|2.0|even though i became bored with lateralus within a couple of months after it's release, i was pretty psyched to hear tool was coming out with this record.<br />for me, lateralus & those 2 perfect circle records didn't even come close to satisfying my tool fix.<br />for me, 10,000 days was even a bigger letdown than lateralus. i actually feel ripped off.<br /><br />thank god newer bands like disturbed,lamb of god and chevelle don't have any problem giving their fans what they want and still rocking the f out.<br />i don't have time in my life for the big egos,self indulgent album releases, and over hyped media exposure of bands such as tool or radiohead or marilyn manson.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I found this movie very informational and totally worth the purchase. Lend it to your friends, co-workers, family members. Total inside look at how our food industry operates. Obviously as you will see its all about how much money people make in the industry & they farmers dont get hardly anything for all the hard work they put into it.
0385736002|5.0|Nicholas Flamel was the greatest alchemist of the Middle Ages.  Records show he died in 1418.  Yet his tomb is empty.  Nicholas Flamel still lives!  He discovered the elixir of life in the \\"Book of Abraham the Mage,\\" the most powerful book that ever existed--that cannot end up in the wrong hands.  But Dr. John Dee, another alchemist with evil plans, steals it.  Only Flamel's friends, Josh and Sophie, have the power to retrieve it and save the world.<br /><br />The Alchemyst is the perfect fantasy adventure novel for boys and reluctant readers.  The story never becomes boring because there are so many unexpected twists and turns.  It has everything from car chases and kidnappings to magicians and monsters.  Fortunately, this New York Times bestseller is only the first in a great series.<br />--Reviewed by Veronica L. Hernandez
1400063515|3.0|Most of the people that buy this book do so to seek information to gain a larger perspective (advantage)? in life. However, most (myself included) are \\"cab drivers\\" not CEOs. When Puckish guys like Taleb who are obviously well read are allowed the luxury of a platform on which to ramble they make what seems a no-lose case for their cause. But they're not talking to us cab drivers, they're speaking to CEOs. To what end other than a potential trickle-down effect do regular folk hope to gain by examining his pearls before the swine? Not much, I'm afraid. His Optima fund is nothing more than a contrarian insurance policy the moneyed few can utilize in case of disaster in the market. I'm not saying that's a bad thing but it is hardly original. I am but the lowliest of the lowly and I've been saying for the better part of a year that hyperinflation may be around the corner. Am I some kind of genius? Hardly. In fact, even if many of the average Joes in this country know that their entire way of life hangs in the equilibrial balance of decisions made by self-serving morons they simply do not have the resources to do anything about it. In essence most of the people that buy and read his books are screwed either way. Then there are pearls such as the case he makes regarding the common intelligence test question (I'm paraphrasing because I don't feel like looking it up): \\"If all Zagrots are Zimbles then are all Zimbles Zagrots?\\" Then he delicately makes it analogous to a racial situation by implying that even though all of Race A may be Criminals, all Criminals are not necessarily comprised of Race A, then cheekily concludes that even those who know better will cringe when on alone on an elevator with a member of Race A. Hmmm? It seems to me that if I am to avoid a potential Black Swan event it would behoove me to avoid the elevator, right? And that's where all his books fall flat. They spend a lot of time criticizing our human foibles but very little time explaining what to do about them. Perhaps I could make a case for reading his books if I felt that, in some way, they illuminated my mind in such a way that they enabled me to avoid the pitfalls in thinking that seem to plague us all. He credits some of his own ability for abstract thinking from reading tons of books and becoming an aesthete. A rather impractical solution for us Cab Drivers. So all a guy like myself can derive from his books is a lengthy endorsement for his Optima fund. Except it doesn't matter because in perfect Talebian style the fund is closed to outside investors. It figures.
B001RIY49C|5.0|First off i'd like to share my unfortunate problem. I bought this and it had to ship all the way to Belgium. My PS3 does not have the region code for the Skynet version of the Blu-ray that comes with this edition. So i was a bit disappointed about that.    Nevertheless i was able to view the extreme version and all the extras on the ultimate edition discs.    Im glad i have this, ill just have to buy the SkyNet edition of blu-ray again somewhere in my region to see the blu-ray.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|\\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" is an ensemble film about a group of women living in the rural south in a town called Whistle Stop. Starring Oscar winners Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy, the movie co-stars Mary Louise Parker and Mary Stuart-Masterson, all performing in roles that were tailored made for the actresses. Bates stars as a woman who has reached middle age and is being taken for granted by her husband. While visiting a nursing home she befriends an elderly lady, played by Tandy, and the two become each other's confidant. Parker and Masterson play women who eventually fall in love at a time when homosexuality wasn't accepted or permitted. The movie was based on the novel, \\"The Whistle Stop\\", written by TV comedian and personality Fannie Flagg, best known for her stint on the '70's gameshow \\"Match Game\\". The movie was both a critical and commercial success, grossing nearly $120,000,000 at the boxoffice. The DVD comes with commentary, an excellent documentary on the film called \\"Moments of Discovery\\" featuring interviews with the cast, plus more.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|My reveiw on this movie is excellent. Very intriguing movie.  I enjoyed it very much. I reccommend that anyone who new how great Michael Jackson was to watch this movie.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to all adults.  Some of the scenes of killing food animals may not be appropriate for kids.  I didn't realize the extent that the government and big corporations had taken over our food industry.  It is a must see.  It has changed the way I shop for my family's food.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great Movie.  I watched it with my 13 year old and was able to relive the excitement the original Star Trek series had with him.  Awesome story line so the old along with the new hit on all bases.  No Star Trek fan will be disappointed.
1439157383|4.0|I was already a Jodi Picoult fan when I plucked this book from my young guy's bookshelf. It's required reading for the sophomore at his Catholic high school, which further piqued my interest. Of course I knew from the movie trailers that this would be a story to inflame debate on ethics, sacrifice and family entanglements. In her other books, the writer has explored challenging questions with no easy answers.  But, what could Picoult have to say this time that could possibly ignite a cross-generational conversation that interests a fifteen-year old beyond PS3 and basketball?  Well, the writer, through her mostly well-formed characters, says a lot to each reader regardless of his age, medical history or place in the family hierarchy. At different levels, my teenager empathized with each of the teenagers in the novel, asking a startling, \\"What if?\\" What if he were Jesse, or Kate, or Anna?  The step-by-step descriptions of Kate's diagnosis and years-long treatment are educational without overwhelming non-medical workers.  These details are important for the reader to understand fully Anna's role as Kate's designated savior - and the impact on Brian and Sara, the parents, and Jesse, their son. Again in this book, Picoult turns research on several topics into powerfully layered connectives among the characters.  I did not close the book with a changed mind: the idea is still abhorrent to me for parents to design a baby for her genetic compatibility with a sibling. Further, Brian and Sara commit the minor child to several painful and risky medical procedures to save the dying sibling.  Sara's last request to Anna to donate a kidney to Kate is the catalyst for the storyline.  The major characters clearly present their unique takes on the unfolding drama. So, Sara's love-driven motives are understandable; but, I could not sympathize with her or like her. This is a realistically presented portrayal of a mother that would - and does - sacrifice two children for the uncertainsurvival of one.  This page-turner was headed for five stars until the last few pages when the contrived closing left me tearful but not convinced.
006056251X|5.0|I read the Wallflower series out of order, and still have to read Summer, however I have to say they're all fabulous so far. The chemistry between Sebastian and Evie was off the charts and needless to say Lisa again delivers a sexy, passionate story filled with emotion and conflict. It was wonderful to see Sebastian, the most notorious rake, fall hard for Evie and reveal how vulnerable he was by that love.  It just made you love him all the more. I wish this series never had to end. I loved all the characters so much and would love to read more about them.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|Yeah, you've seen this kind of thing before. But the players are pleasant and Massachussets never looked better as a substitute for Alaska. That was pretty cool. A chick flick a guy can get thru.

1400052173|4.0|As a former scientist, I vaguely remember seeing something about Henrietta Lacks, probably in a footnote in some textbook or a footnote to a paper in the medical literature, one of course, where HeLa cells were used. I can't stress enough, the author was absolutely correct when describing the ubiquitous nature of HeLa cell usage in laboratories  around the world even today.    Do scientists ever think about where the human cell line they are using in their research came from? No, they don't. The author brings Henrietta to life in the pages of this book, along with the lives of her family. You don't have to know anything about science, or care about it at all, in order to find this a fascinating book, giving you glimpses into the world of medical research, glimpses into the lives of Henrietta and her family, and a glimpse into the very complicated ethical world we live in. You may originally feel outrage that Henrietta died poor, and her children and relatives continue to struggle financially, while millions of dollars have been exchanged using her cells, directly or as a result of their use in research, but hopefully, you will come to understand that this was not some vast conspiracy, most scientists don't get rich (although universities may be enriched by grant money and patent royalties), but we are all enriched by the scientific and medical advancements that resulted. The author makes clear that Henrietta should have been informed that her tissue was going to be used for medical research, that is a given. You get a glimpse into the discrimination that pervaded society, even in terms of access to heath care, in Henrietta's day . (More poignant now given the current health care debate.) But the issues surrounding any monetary gain by anyone or any entity is more controversial, and harder to define.    Bottomline: this a a well written biography and a history of sorts, and you will be entertained as you no doubt learn more than you knew  before (about the way medical research worked in the past, and the way this sort of thing likely could not happen now as it did then), and you have a lot to think about when you are done. Scientists and researchers will be fascinated by this story on an entirely other level. However, we all owe a nod to Henrietta, and to the author, for telling her story.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Dr. Grandin is simply an amazing person. Her mother is to be commended for refusing to allow her child to be institutionalized. It just goes to show you how people can be helped if they have a parent and community to nurture them. I understand that Temple Grandin came from an affluent background and that her mom was Harvard-educated which probably gave her access to resources that lower-income children would have difficulty to. I know of an excellent school for children with autism, however, the annual fee for attending this school is around $300,000 per year.    I laughed and cried while watching the movie. I laughed because of Ms. Grandin's wonderful ability to \\"tell it like it is\\". This is what a lot of businesses need to hear. There is too much money wasted in corporate America and government on policies designed by people who lack Dr. Grandin's insights and empathy.     As a woman of color I wish I had Dr. Grandin's gift to not recognize social cues. If I had been so blessed I would have been much further ahead in my career as a woman and as a minority. It helps to be able to not recognize social cues especially when they are negative.    And I especially enjoyed the way her instructor taught her to view death. I am a highly emotional person who feels things deeply and sometimes this can be a curse especially with my job at the IRS in which I must implement callous unfeeling governmental laws and policies. If a lot of us could accept the cycle of birth and death and change a lot of us would be better off.     Ms. Grandin is blessed in a lot of ways because she knows how to live life to an extent that a lot of us wish we could.
0545140315|4.0|Lonely hearts club is a wonderful coming of age tale for young girls trying to figure out fellas and friendships... and learning to balance the two. I ADORED the characters, the story, the identifiabiltiy, aaaand especially ALL the beatles references which led me to pick up the book to begin with. I would encourage any girl who was ever confused about boys to pick up this book. It's very light and fun and thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />This book is for anyone who had once suffered from a broken heart... and found salvation from friends. And could express themselves by identifying from song lyrics when words just couldn't cut it. And that even if you have a boyfriend or not, there is something to be found in a great friendship that should never be passed up and taken for granted. I read this book after dinner... and didn't stop til I finished it. I'm looking forward to future titles from this author.<br /><br />Welcome to the club!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|The product is an excellent tribute to the King Of Pop Michael Jackson.  It shows his intensity for perfection and his dedication to his craft.  He surely was the world's greatest entertainer.  In a class by himself.  His humility and concern for others, the love for others.  The respect he had for those who worked for him.  He was a true humanitarian.  I have watched this movie a number of times and each time I see somethin that I missed.  I loved it!!!  Knowing his legacy you would have to know that it would be all that you expected it to be or more.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|I came across the socialistworker web-site sometime around this film's release. It's nice to see that people are discussing these very important issues that affect just about every facet of the global society. One of the most interesting things to look at is the \\"Human Development Index\\" which you can look at on Wikipedia. The United States does not rank in the top 10 while 7 european countries do. Wikipedia also has a \\"list of countries by income equality\\" which is interesting to note because all of the countries that ranked in the top 10 on the Human Development Index have a smaller \\"wealth gap\\" than the United States. This certainly isn't conclusive but interesting to learn about.     It seems that one of the most important factors regarding global economic equality is organized labor(Unions). But in order for unions to be truly effective, they have to be GLOBAL. The reason for this is that business owners will just move production from a unionized country to a non-unionized country in order to increase profit margins.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies, I watch this all year round and it never gets old, I ALWAYS laugh!
B002VJ0576|3.0|Probably ranks as one of the lousiesr adaptations.     Almost enjoyed catching the little blunders more than the movie.  Example: Picking the lock on a door with lock on left side of door, next scene has them entering the room with an entirely different style door with the lock on the right side of the door.      Lousy Holmes, one of the more enjoyable Watson roles.

B0002YCVXI|5.0|I fell in love with Ennio Morricone's music when I saw the Mission twenty years ago and have been a fan ever since.  Mr. Ma does an excellent job putting his stamp on the music, while not dominating it. Truly a beautiful work of music and a must own if you are a fan of Mr. Morricone's work.
0156034026|3.0|Stylistically, I liked the flow of this book; it was a smooth and quick read.    Content-wise, well...I could see what point the author was trying to make, though I thought it had limitations.  Who was the main character to self-righteously pass judgement on the American lifestyle?  His exposure was very limited and he didn't seem to experience much outside of a very narrow and elitist lens.  He was just young and immature, and thus it was very easy for him to crack after putting all of his eggs in the basket of his elitist high-stress job and crazy face girlfriend.  He probably never would have cracked and quit his job if crazyface hadn't emasculated him by not being able to get wet for him.
031606792X|1.0|As much as I tried to like it, I hate the book. It is very over hyped. It's awful. Twilight as a whole series is just horrid.<br /><br />I found the writing to be a little weak, overly cliched, and filled with plot holes. I also found the themes to be disturbing for anyone younger than 18 to be reading.<br /><br />The impriting can be, and will be, seen as pedophiliac in some causes as Jacob imprited on Renesmee by (whom will be grown up at the age of 7 because of how she ages). Renesmee's birth has been described as extremely gory -- even to the point that many readers, such as myself, have stopped reading and said that they will never read the series again.<br /><br />Bella and Edward's relationship in the book was very forced and just focused on the smut aspect of the relationship. Their relationship is very forced, and they do not act like a couple who had just had a baby. Any conflict of this book was taken away, and I didn't like that at all. The book was way too cheesy.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I actually feel ripped off. But I also realized something over all. The movie itself is far from scary, but the scary part is that millions of people fell for the media hype. It just goes to show just how gulible, we as Americans are, to believe just about anything we are told without forming our own opinion. Whatever the media says about movies, music, world events, we believe it to be fact. That's sad. Just because a bunch of media critics claim this work to be one of the scariest movies ever, we all fell for it and went stampeding to buy it or pay outrageous money at a theater. I bought it new at $20, and I feel ripped off.<br /><br />Why do I feel ripped off? Because I thought I was going to watch a movie and be scared out of my $20 wits, only to find a movie with only $1 worth of medeocre chills and a script full of issues.  I was expecting more of a ghost hunting type story, but instead we get another exorcism/ possesion piece of drivel.<br /><br />This story of the movie is told through a camcorder. But not very well. This movie has been hyped to be like [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]] but it really isn't. Where the Blair Witch sucessfully created an impending atmosphere of doom, PA fails. I really didn't care for the charaters in this movie. I liked them, but I didn't really care what happened to them. There are long periods of, well, bad acting, between the interesting parts. I sat forward in my chair expecting to have a huge scare, but what happened was only typical of other horro movies, and left me wondering what all the hype was about.<br /><br />The story leaves alot of unanswered questions. They discover another similar woman who died from a similar situation. Ok...but how and why? The lead states that she has always had this phatom about her...ok...why? No one really expalins why this thing is about.<br /><br />The effedcts are cheesy at best. Fishing line type effects to pull doors and things. Photoshop foot prints. Etc.<br /><br />If you ARE looking for a good cam type thriller, check out the documentary style thriller<br />[[ASIN:B000HEWEQW The Last Broadcast]], or [[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]], or [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]]riller, check out the documentary style thriller  [[ASIN:B000HEWEQW The Last Broadcast]], or [[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]], or [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]]

0440244870|1.0|I heard about the movie before I knew there was a book. I was interested because of the subject matter; I am a compulsive spender (largely reformed). I enjoyed the movie and many of the reviewers of the movie said the book was a lot better, so I started reading the book.<br /><br />The writing itself is good; it really draws you in and goes at a nice fast pace. But I could not sympathize with Becky in the book AT ALL. She had way bigger issues than a shopping addiction, and if she were real she would need some intensive professional help. First, she is a pathological liar -- it seemed that every conversation contained lies, often unnecessarily. Second, she is a willfully terrible employee, completely uninterested in doing anything like good work. Third, she is not only somewhat of an airhead bumbler, she is a TOTAL airhead bumbler to the point that I questioned her intelligence. Fourth, she is completely careless of anything and anyone outside herself. And of course #5 is her spending problem. She had no redeeming qualities that I could discern. I couldn't believe that any guy worth having could actually be interested in her, especially not one of the top entrepeneurs in England as well as the 15th richest man in England!<br /><br />Reading neverending accounts of her lying and trying to get out of awkard situations due to her complete selfishness was stressful, annoying, and not funny at all. In every bad situation she got herself into (which is pretty much every paragraph), my heart would literally start beating faster. There's enough stress in real life without its being compounded by a novel! So even though I was curious about the plot, I got through just 1/3 of the book and stopped (after skimming through to see if maybe it got better, which it didn't).<br /><br />People who love the book complain about all the changes the movie made, but I actually think those changes are an improvement. In the movie she displayed some of those negative traits, but to a much lesser degree. She was open with her roommate about the details of her financial problems, she was a good journalist in the job she had before going to the financial magazine, and she clearly cared about the people in her life. She was quite an airhead (more in a clutzy physical way than in the book, and I interpreted that as being mostly for gag value) but she also had many non-airhead moments and she was still conscientious. Luke falling for her was still hard to believe, but their relationship wasn't the central point of the story for me anyway. I was able to relate to and even care about Becky in the movie. In the book... not a chance! (Ironically, many of the book fans said the same thing but in reverse; they could sympathize with the book Becky but not the movie Becky! Different strokes for different folks!!)<br /><br />As I was reading the book, I seriously wondered why it has so many fans--why so many readers aren't seemingly bothered by her lack of ethics--and does that say something about our times? Do most young people lie all the time like she does, and shirk on their jobs, etc.? So I read the 1-star reviews (all of which I completely agree with) and I was relieved to find that there were others who reacted to the book the same way I did. Also a friend of mine who liked the book told me that an unsympathetic main character is pretty common in British novels.open with her roommate about the details of her financial problems, she was a good journalist in the job she had before going to the financial magazine, and she clearly cared about the people in her life.

B002W6Z0UK|4.0|I wasn't a fan of Gaga's from the start.  It took a while for this illustrious diva to steal a way into my heart.  In fact, I still find that her breakout single `Just Dance' is her weakest (or one of them) link.  That said, I remember, before I even got my hands on `The Fame', I read this small article in EW in regards to her (then) upcoming `The Fame Monster', a collection of eight more Gaga tracks.  The article was entitled `Not a Gaga Fan?  Think Again' and it listed a few reasons why her new EP was something you should get your hands on, basically claiming that if you swallow whole anything from Beyonce, ABBA, Twilight or country music then you will want to devour this album.<br /><br />Yes, Gaga continues to genre bend and she does it wonderfully.  Still, she has a few kinks to work out (she's so inspirational as an artist because she was really become just that, an ARTIST, but she hasn't learnt how to reign in all her inspiration to create something polished and perfected).<br /><br />So, we've all heard `Bad Romance' and `Telephone' by now, and that's a good thing since both tracks are great.  `Bad Romance' is a tad overplayed, and it never really sat with me as pristine Gaga (I still prefer tracks like `LoveGame' or `Poker Face') but `Telephone' was the big `WOW' moment for me.  I loathed that trashy `Video Phone' song that Beyonce put on her `Sasha Fierce' album and so I was really afraid that this would wind up being a similar disappointment, but it is so much fun and such a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Gaga makes anything better (she's like Lil' Wayne).<br /><br />I found the ABBA inspired `Alejandro' and the similarly styled `Dance in the Dark' to be a tad underwhelming.  `Alejandro' feels kind of corny to me, and `Dance in the Dark' is just dated.  I like that she can make old feel modern, but this doesn't really feel modern (or fresh) to me.  `So Happy I Could Die' takes that very same `dated' club sound and spins it rather freshly, serving up a memorable and exciting trip to the disco.<br /><br />So, EW stated that the Twilight fans would sink their fangs into `Monster' and `Teeth', two tracks that use the body as feast grounds for lyrical poetry, and while I fervently appose all interest in anything `Twi-related', I absolutely dig both of these tracks, especially the closing `Teeth'.  `Teeth' is all sorts of wrong, but so incredibly right at the very same time.  I love the way she just goes off about her \\"bad girl meat\\".  It just has this slinky swagger that is so captivating (her bluntness is refreshing) and so unique in this genre (pop is all tease, no bite...but Gaga is like a ravenous dog).<br /><br />My religion is you.<br /><br />And then there is `Speechless', a song that pretty much leaves me just that; speechless.  Calling upon influences that are more southern rock than country (think Lynyrd Skynyrd), this song is possibly the best thing she's ever done and proves that she is BEYOND TALENTED.  I mean, this girl is not just your average pop princess, she has real chops and musical taste that transcends the boundaries of genre.  This song is an effortlessly divine emotional ride that shows real depth for Gaga.<br /><br />Oh, and I have no problem with the edited content, although some do (and rightfully so).isco.

B001GST11O|4.0|This was an absolutely fantastic concert, i.e. David Gilmour Live at Gdansk.  I wouldn't have gone out of my way to find it had I not seen large excerpts of it on TV (cable) in 2009. The DVD however appears to have substituted artistically and musically important sections of that Live Gdansk concert with section of others (and studio videos) that pale by comparison; and I felt cheated having purchase it.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|I've already reviewed `The Fame' and `Monster' and so I've decided to just kind of copy and paste to review `The Fame (Monster)'.  So, in parts, this is what I've had to say about the music la'Gaga has provided for us on this 2-Disc epic.<br /><br />Ha, like that?<br /><br />I started by labeling Gaga as pointless entertainment when I reviewed `The Fame'.<br /><br />\\"If you like to swallow spoonfuls of self-indulgent, shallow, materialistic banter then Lady Gaga's debut album `The Fame' is going to be right up your ally.  That isn't meant to be a diss by any means, but it is only realistic to call out Gaga's collection of meaningless tracks for what they really are.  There is no weight here whatsoever, but that is not the point.  In interviews she's been very clear that she doesn't care that her songs are pointless.  All she cares about is that they are fun.\\"<br /><br />I still agree with this, for the most part.  Some of her music (like `Speechless' and `Paparazzi') has real depth, but for the most part she is trashy pop fun, and she indulges in that fact (and you should too).<br /><br />\\"The four singles she released off (`THE FAME') album are pretty representative of who Gaga is as an artist.  `Just Dance', the first single, is an infectious club track that makes mention of Gaga's love for liquor, boys and music.  `Poker Face' is laced with innuendo and capitalizes on slick beats and catchy lyrics.  While both of those tracks grow old over time, `LoveGame' and `Paparazzi' happen to stand tall as stellar pop tracks.  `Paparazzi' especially uses a darkly suggestive stalker story to express love in a wildly inventive way.  It may be the best track on the album.  `LoveGame' opens brilliantly (that beat IS sick) and continues with ferocity.\\"<br /><br />I continued speaking about her radio singles when reviewing `Monster':<br /><br />\\"So, we've all heard `Bad Romance' and `Telephone' by now, and that's a good thing since both tracks are great.  `Bad Romance' is a tad overplayed, and it never really sat with me as pristine Gaga (I still prefer tracks like `LoveGame' or `Poker Face') but `Telephone' was the big `WOW' moment for me.  I loathed that trashy `Video Phone' song that Beyonce put on her `Sasha Fierce' album and so I was really afraid that this would wind up being a similar disappointment, but it is so much fun and such a guilty pleasure.\\"<br /><br />I think, with both `The Fame' and `Monster', she has shown inconsistencies.  She is consistently entertaining and interesting, but she hasn't perfected her game yet.  If she had compiled these albums from the very beginning and trimmed out the fat it would have easily been one of the best debuts of the decade.<br /><br />On that note:<br /><br />\\"The rest of (`THE FAME') is a little all over the place, from great to good to mediocre.  Songs like `The Fame' is cringe worthy in their poor quality, and `Eh, Eh' is just boring.  It was nice to see a different side to Gaga, but it was constructed horrifically.  `I Like It Rough' is a clich&eacute;d mess that just never really takes off the way it could have.  I enjoy her fearless display of overt sensuality, but this was just painful in its unoriginality.<br /><br />Songs like `Beautiful, Dirty, Rich' and `Money Honey' are deliciously tacky in their exploitation of Gaga's primary concern, money.  `Boys Boys Boys' capitalizes on her second foremost thought (you guessed it).  All three songs are fun and exciting regardless of the fact that they are nothing overly spectacular.  `Brown Eyes' is a different pace for Gaga, and it works rather well.  It's nice to see her do something different and not fall flat on her face.  It has a soft vulnerability about it that I like, but Gaga is above all else a strong and independent woman, and it shows on every track.<br /><br />The best tracks here (aside from `LoveGame' and `Paparazzi') are the infectious `Paper Gangster', complete with full on swagger that suits Gaga better than one may think,`Starstruck', which ignites with fiery bravado and funky atmosphere and the closing track `Summerboy', which exploits Gaga's vices with a spunk that isn't seen on most of the album.\\"<br /><br />...and:<br /><br />\\"I found the ABBA inspired `Alejandro' and the similarly styled `Dance in the Dark' to be a tad underwhelming.  `Alejandro' feels kind of corny to me, and `Dance in the Dark' is just dated.

B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|This movie got slammed pretty bad by critics and fans alike.<br />Why?<br />I don't know.<br />Now that I've seen the movie....<br /><br />The good?<br />Great story, great acting, great FX.<br />The story itself is a little unbelievable but it's sci-fi so let's give the movie a break.<br />The direction is done well.<br />I would much rather Willis move in this direction than the last Die Hard.<br />He's a little too old to still be the \\"action star\\".<br /><br />What was bad?<br />Hmmmm....not much really.<br />Everything is done well it's just that the story itself is so unbelievable that it's a little hard to get past it.<br /><br />I recommend Surrogates for a rental, it's a good action movie but nothing life changing.

0786856297|5.0|Can't say enough good things about these books.  They have very good morals for kids (clear concepts of right and wrong) while also being good stories to keep them interested.  My 9-year-old daughter finished the Lightning Thief today so we rushed out to see the movie.  The rule of the house is \\"no movie until you've read the books\\"-- something she's not terribly happy about when it comes to Potter.  Anyway, she learned a valuable lesson today-- I thank Rick Riordan for that.  Not only did he write a great group of stories that my daughter loves, but he also allowed the movie to be made is such a loose likeness (a very poor likeness) to the book that my daughter realized that BOOKS ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN MOVIES.  That's a lesson I've been trying to teach her for years and it was solidfied in just one afternoon.  Thanks Rick.
B000JIHP88|4.0|I really like this mobile.  There are 4 music choices - all of which sound nice.  And, the mobile has lots of bright colors, which attract the baby's attention.  There are also options for increasing the volume, turning off the motion, and turning off the light.  My only complaint is that it doesn't fit on my son's crib (Babyletto Modo Crib), so I had to attach it to a short chair instead.  My son can look at it when he's in his bouncy seat.  I've heard that mobiles can hinder sleep when they are attached to the crib, so I'm not too worried about having the mobile as entertainment for my son in his chair instead of on his crib.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|I am not a paid reviewer.  There are some good performances in this, mostly of the child actors, and the dialogue sounds realistic which is a refreshing change for Hollywood.  However, the plot is interminable and the time it takes for the tale to spin doesn't justify the message being delivered by the film.  It seems like a film that the actors wanted to do, not that the audience wanted to see.
B001UV4XX8|5.0|Engrossing, slow and artistic, speculative fiction story got my goat! Kelley's direction is fresh air with classic moves in a hyper-paced cinema period. Also dialogue driven, detailed and da big budget too.<br />Mathesons' Button' Box; that gives and takes so much; plays well and is a creepy story that morphs in 'this' film; into a Kelleyworld that's located somewhere near Lynchburg.<br />Best in a while...almost Vonnegut style.<br /><br />Blu-ray looks and sounds great; but you best turn your sound up a tad. Sound is conservative; but good and strong.
0061684384|5.0|I loved this book. The pictures of all the art in are amazing. I got this because I love tattoos and LA Ink. I was not disappointed. It was a well put together collection of photos and stories. It is also nice enough looking to leave out, such as on a coffee table. Kat Von D is very open and straight forward. A quick, easy but very enjoyable read
B00003CX8U|5.0|One of the most influential and innovative pieces ever. Required viewing for anyone serious about dance - whether as a dancer or a watcher.     I am not a dancer, but whenever I watch this, and however many times I do, I have to remember to breathe.     and when it is over it lingers     like all the very best musicals ...
B002WY65VU|4.0|Good solid Zombie comedy. Woody is laugh out loud funny in Zombieland. The Bill Murry cameo also great, and yes, everyone regrets Garfield.     Should have put more of the rules under special features for the dvd is my only con.
0385474547|3.0|Heard masses about this author and the book seemed to be exactly the sort of thing I like (different cultures, Africa, talented black author, good yarn etc.)     I was very disappointed. Maybe I am simply not sufficiently intelligent? or maybe it is 'Emperor's New Clothes' syndrome? Maybe the structure of the story itself follows some ancient format?     I found nothing to engage me with the characters, I found the frequent breaks for fable-telling a bit annoying, and the story had an alien 'shape' for me.     One passage I did enjoy was the White man discussing Christianity with the Elder near the end of the book. The Elder made some convincing arguments that reverence for a stick was a good model for Christianity - that was food for thought.     Otherwise, went right over my head.
B002YIHO7I|3.0|...to write this review. It truly does. I'll explain why:     I love Sade to death. I not only own each of her seven prior releases (five studio sets, a greatest hits compilation and a live album) on both CD and vinyl format. I have Sade b-sides, extended versions, alternate takes, remixes, rarities, you name it, I not only have it but love it. There's not a Sade release that hasn't deeply moved me...     ...until Solider of Love.     I grinned ear to ear while my heart skipped a beat when I garnered an advance copy of SOL a week before its release. I was ready to fall in love with another Sade album on first listen just as I had with all of the others.     Yet, at the end of SOL's 43-minute duration, I was left wondering what I never thought I'd wonder about Sade's long-awaited return: \\"I WAITED TEN YEARS FOR THIS?!\\"     SOL is not a terrible album but any means but it is a surprisingly listless one. The album actually starts out on a strong note with the silky \\"The Moon and The Sky\\", which is classic Sade. The brilliant title track follows (for the first time in Sade's musical lifetime, the band hints at a new direction while still sounding exactly like they always have). Yet, after that, the album dives into a slow, samey patch of indistinguishableness. In all fairness, there are some slight moments after the high point of the first two tracks. \\"Morning Bird\\" is a minimalistic mood piece, similar to \\"I Never Thought I'd See The Day\\", \\"Like A Tattoo\\" and \\"It's Only Love That Gets You Through. The amused good feeling of the raga- influenced \\"Babyfather\\" is perhaps the most whimsical song that Sade has ever released. The song is the lone sunny moment on the otherwise dour disc. (All of Sade's prior albums had a nice variation of mood and groove. SOL doesn't- it just remains on one level.) Aside from those tracks, none of the remainder of SOL distinguishes itself. Nothing else stands out and sticks. This is a very first for a Sade album.     I was hoping that SOL would grow on me but almost a month since its release; it still stands as the lone Sade album that just doesn't captivate me.     I will always love Sade to the fullest. I'm very happy for SOL's soaring international commercial success and will root for it to continue. It's a testament to the band's organic talent and Adu's graceful, natural mystique that she can release an album ten years after her last (at the advanced age of 51) and still outsell and outclass younger, lesser talents in an age where people no longer really purchase music.     Yet, the album's success doesn't change the fact that it's the very first Sade album that I do not love.     And that hurts for me to say that.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I was in floods of tears before the film even began. The actors do an overture of the main song out of character right to camera. I am someone who was in my early 20's in the eighties and I can't forget. I can never get the lyrics right - is it 50065000800 minutes? anyway I defy anyone not to be moved. All those vibrant living young souls who never grew old.     Singing rapturous, dancing explosive,     characters? I love the relationship between the tough gay guy and his dancing diva gay friend - a true and deep love on screen that's never mawkish.     the plot, well who cares in a way when you are soaring along with the film.     Un petit La Boheme, ditto La Traviata and it is fun to spot the arias but at times it drags a bit -
B000A2RRF4|1.0|I was very disappointed in this concert DVD mainly because it was edited so poorly.  It seems like every 30 seconds the cameras cut to shots of the audience- who cares about seeing that?!  Most of us go to concerts and buy concert DVDs to watch the performer, not look around at the reactions of the crowd!  It seemed like as a whole this video consisted of 75% audience shots/reactions and only 25% of Michael's performances and stage shots.  The video started right off this way with tons of audience shots and it bothered me from the start.  I thought \\"I hope it doesn't do this throughout the whole concert\\", but it did.  So much of Michael's performances are lost to us the viewer as we, beyond our control, are forced to watch fans in the crowd faint, cry, sing, yell, etc.  Then, a lot of the footage shown of Michael performing is shot from a camera far away, as if we are standing in the 500th row watching the concert.  Not many close-ups of the stage and of Michael performing.  Very frustrating!    Other dislikes:  Michael's onesie shirt that accented his crotch area in gold for the first several songs. Yukk.  Poor taste in costume design and poor choice in wearing it.  Then there was a segment where a video is shown on big screens to the audience where Michael is in an alley like in his \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" video.  In this short film he is practically \\"pleasuring himself\\" and that seems to be the theme of it.  I fast forwarded this as my 15 year old daughter was watching the DVD with me- and really, nobody needs to see that!  Come on Michael!  I think this was the time in Michael's career when he had taken a friendship with Madonna and asked her for her \\"artistic\\" ideas to integrate into his performances.  I wish he never asked for such advice/influence from someone like her.  Thanks for nothing, Madonna!  And thanks for nothing film editors of this concert!
0307454541|3.0|Much has been written about this book.  Most of it good and it is certainly deserved.  However, despite the quality of the writing (VERY good) and the quality of the storyline (original and artful), I did not care too much for the book as a whole.<br /><br />Without spoiling it for anyone who has not yet read it, there are some scenes in here that are not for the faint of heart.  I can handle gore and even the occasional sex scene in a book, but there are some sex scenes in this book that, though absolutely necessary to the plot of the book, were hard to get through.  I do not consider myself prudish, but these were absolutely brutal.  It ruined the book for me.<br /><br />This is a matter of personal preference rather than my being offended.  If this sort of thing does not bother you, then you will really like this book.  For me, it was a fatal flaw.
0061807400|5.0|I wanted to see the movie Shutter Island, but decided to read the novel first. At some point early in the book, I suspected the basic outcome so I was not suprised when it was revealed. However, I continued to be thouroughly engaged in the story all the way through. The author did his job masterfully and kept me interested with every turn of the page. I highly recommend this book.
B00275EGWY|5.0|i read a book similar to this a couple years before this movie came out. different people different war but same story. addicted to war like a drug. its a great story both the movie and the book (my war gone by i miss it so) its great.
B00284BMBM|2.0|It kinda hurts to give this 2 stars.  Negative reviews aren't popular, but I often find the best insights amongst the reviews that are under 5 stars (ever notice the statistical skew in ratings?).  Hope you find something of use here:     I'm a Chris Daughtry fan. I really dug his first album (4 stars).  Powerful rock voice, & arguably the best rock vocal talent to come out of Idol, I really wanted to like this second album... and so I bought it without listening to the preview snippets.  Don't make that mistake.      What follows isn't your usual review w/ song-by-song dialog... plenty of those on Amazon.  I'll come at this from the angle of musicianship and studio recording/mixing/production.       The self titled first album went 4X Platinum versus \\"Leave This Town's\\" approx 1X Platinum.  I can see a few reasons for the difference in sales.        It's not simply attributable to the now hackneyed \\"Sophomore Slump\\", nor is it because of any lack for talent in song writing, with co-writing credits to people like Richard Marx, Chad Kroeger, et al.  (See wiki for other collaborators).  And Chris managed to lure Vince Gill (a seriously talented guitar player, song writer, & vocalist) into singing with him on the silly sounding \\"Tennessee Line\\" tune (the \\"fiddle\\" at the end made me throw up in my mouth a little bit).      And the *relative* lack of snap with this second album isn't completely at the hands of Producer Howard Benson, who produced both albums (I'm never *quite* sure how much to attribute the final product to the producer or to the recording engineers and mixing engineers).    I point at both the second album's band members and at the studio engineering and/or mixing as the points of relative difference... along with an intangible I can't quite put my finger on, other than to say something just didn't *grab* with the second album's blend of songs.      1)  Chris proudly proclaimed that he was happy to now have a \\"real band\\" for this second album.  He should have found a way to keep the studio guys from the first album.  On the first album, Phil X (Canadian Phil Xenidis) did a phenomenal job playing a variety of rock rhythm guitar styles, nice layering, all very clearly recorded, and all showing a seasoned hand at both getting a variety of great studio guitar sounds.  And Xenidis' sensibility in steadily building the guitar lines from front to back of the songs really made the songs interesting on repeated listening... professional, astute, and talented rock guitar.  The guitar players who are now a part of Daughtry's \\"real band\\" sound positively ham-fisted by comparison, with both mediocre guitar/amp sounds and playing.  Xenidis' work schools these guys.  Guitar playing is lost on some people, but absolutely glaring to me.  Phil X, bass player Chris Chaney (ex Jane's Addiction and Panic Channel), and drummer Josh Freese put down a great sound on the first album.  Slashes' guitar solo on \\"What I Want\\" was classic Slash wah-wah noodling, a bit \\"phoned-in\\", but still interesting.  I found the second album to be very uninvolving from a musical standpoint, and you might too if you happen to have any predilections towards musicianship. If not, you might be happy with #2.  (pun intended)    2) Studio engineering on the first album, admittedly a very forward and compressed sounding studio production (the norm these days), at least differentiated all the musicians parts clearly, and importantly, Daughtry's awesome voice had a full, warm expanse that showcased his range.  The second album has Chris' vocals sounding thin on the low end, and sounding a bit strident in his upper registers.  Not sure what went wrong, but the first album sounds so much more balanced, while the second album has an unforgiveably trebly balance, like he was singing into a cheap microphone. A shame, as it shouldn't be hard to get this right with today's studio technology.  Did I mention that Phil Xenidis' guitar playing and amp sounds kicked @_$_$ on the first album?  Uh, yeah... I repeat myself.  Kerrang.      I listened to the first album repeatedly... and I still listen to it about once a month.  I tried hard, but couldn't muster interest in the second album after two weeks of \\"giving it time\\".  I held off writing this review for months, hoping the second album would grow on me, but I threw my first impressions at the wall, and they stuck.      Sorry, Chris and Howard.  Better hire some studio talent for round 3, lest a great rock vocal fledgling melt the wax in his wings and crash on the tarmac.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am 50 years old and considered myself in pretty good shape.  My 25 year old daughter bought this dvd and insisted I buy it.  I will be forever in her debt.  When I did the level one, day one of this dvd I thought I might die.  It was tough, but 20 minutes of anything is doable.  That is the beauty of this dvd...20 MINUTES!! I can make no excuses for only 20 minutes out of my day.  I am now on day 32 of the dvd and I can actually say I look forward to working out.  I only lost a couple of pounds, but I was not overweight to begin with, but...INCHES... that is the payoff of this workout.  I have lost inches where I did not think possible.  Also my arms look incredible.  I was getting those flappy arms that everyone says comes with being 50.  I didn't think I could change that, well I did.  LOVE THE WORKOUT!!

B001QBC4AG|4.0|Wow, I'm a die-hard Who fan and can't believe I never wore this one out growing up. The songs are great; early Who with glimpses of what's to come with Odds and Sods and Tommy. They intersperse some ads from radio that were playing back then - very fun touch. If you love the Who, this should be in your collection.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|If you are at all familiar with the Beatrice Potter books you will LOVE getting to know the woman who created them.  This was a great movie for our family and elementary school aged children who have already read these wonderful children's tales.  Just get it.  Seriously.  It gets even better if you watch it a second or third time.
B001W79MBI|4.0|Sword of the Stranger / B001W79MBI<br /><br />We watch a lot of anime at our house, but \\"Sword of the Stranger\\" really does stand out in terms of artwork. The art is apparently all hand drawn; the final effect is a look that is incredibly crisp, clear, and beautiful. Definitely a great deal of time and effort went into making a superb production - the voice acting is just as gorgeous as the art.<br /><br />Although the story line is not particularly new or innovative (a young boy of destiny must be protected by a jaded and master-less traveling warrior), \\"Sword of the Stranger\\" really encapsulates why this type of story is such a classic. Both the young boy and the traveling warrior are wonderfully characterized, and their developing relationship as the two come to depend on each other is beautiful to behold. \\"Sword of the Stranger\\" also scores points for being willing to depict pretty much everyone in a position of political power (Chinese and Japanese alike) as being equally corrupted by power - somehow, it's always refreshing to see movies that are willing to dump the usual \\"good country\\" vs. \\"bad country\\" makeup and just wash its hands of the political leaders of both sides.<br /><br />If there is a downside to \\"Sword of the Stranger\\", it may be that some of the introspective travel sequences seem a bit slow and drawn-out. Despite all the action, the movie somehow manages to retain an almost dreamy feel, making the movie seem longer than it actually is. I definitely recommend a viewing (particularly on the Blu-Ray version, if you want to give your eyes a real feast), but you might not feel that the replay value of this superb movie is all that you might want.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

B0013LL2Z2|4.0|Logan's Run / B0013LL2Z2     One of the frustrating things about old science fiction movies is that no matter how good the underlying plot is, it always seems that the movie production is so poor, by today's standards, that the medium ends up obscuring the message. With that in mind, I was fully prepared to be disappointed by \\"Logan's Run\\", and I ended up being fully surprised instead.     The basic premise of a dystopia future where a life of pleasure has replaced a life of turmoil, at the hefty price of free will and life expectancy is nothing new - all of this is the bread-and-butter of classic science fiction fare. But \\"Logan's Run\\" as a movie pulls off the plot exceptionally well. The action is well-paced, and never descends into the long, introspective, moody art shots that unfortunately plague other movies of the time. The exposition is well done, and is never interrupted by an author filibuster to explain why, precisely, this dystopia is such a bad thing - instead, the viewer is trusted to be able to work out those details for themselves. The acting, too, is quite well done and doesn't feature heavy-handed ham moments.    I really enjoyed watching \\"Logan's Run\\", and I recommend it for all science fiction fans, regardless of whether they've seen it before or not. A lot of classic movies tend to rely heavily on a nostalgia factor to still be enjoyable today, but I found \\"Logan's Run\\" to be fresh, exciting, and compelling even though I'd never seen it before.     ~ Ana Mardoll
1400052173|5.0|This has been my \\"car\\" book for the last couple of weeks.  I read it when I'm waiting for the kids to be done with whatever they're doing. I've had a couple of good streches with it and either way I'm always anxious to pick it back up. It's a great mix of history, science, culture, and human interest.  So many times we look at American history like we learned it in school and forget that there's always a complexity to how we got where we are.  The story of the HeLa cells is a long and complicated one.  It brings up a huge variety of questions that aren't and can't be answered by one book. The author however does a great job of humanizing the story while keeping it interest on a technical and historical level.

B00005JKTF|3.0|This film was better than I expected. The story is interesting, not totally implausible, and the fact that the film was shot in France adds a lot to the overall quality of the movie.  CB is good as usual.  Ending is fairly predictable though...
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this show because I think it shows how these guys may not fit in with what we perceive as \\"Normal\\" in society, but they are so cool in their own right.  Sheldon reminds me a little bit of one of my nephews, and I think it's awesome to have a show that says \\"Yeah we don't fit in everywhere, but it's okay to be us\\".  Funny funny show.
B002YIHO7I|3.0|Sade has been on my top singer list since I first heard her song almost 16 years ago. I loved almost all of her songs.   At first, I didn't want to believe all the negative reviews about this album. Sadly, after listening to the entire album, I have to agree with many that this is a let-down.     I am not sure exactly what is different yet. Maybe it is the lyrics, maybe there is some subtle vocal change, maybe a combination. I can still listen to the old Sade songs all night, but not this album. So it is not my taste of music has changed.      The album is just forgettable and average. I still hope Sade releases new albums in the future. And I sure hope I will once again fall in love with her new songs.

B000UR9QGW|3.0|The blu-ray transfer is average at best. On a 50 inch screen its limitations are very evident. For example, the scene in the car at the beginning is very grainy and soft. This is a recurring problem, as is edge enhancement (e.g., when the demon comes for Ash towards the end). The good news is that once the blood (of many colours) starts to fly, the film becomes much more vibrant (as you would expect) to watch. Thus, reds, blacks, greens are a lot of fun in HD. Special effects are also noticeably underdone on blu-ray. One thing I did particularly enjoy was some aspects of the sound design. It often sounds like it was recorded at the bottom of a well, but one part of the film is great. Having seen the film in the theatre when first released, the zooming sound of the demon chasing Ash in the first part of the film is important for the impact it lends to that scene. In the blu-ray, it is very well done, moving around the listening room, and with a lot of nice bass extension and dynamic range (something the DVD lacks). Evil Dead II is a funhouse ride. You either love Raimi's demented sense of humour or you don't.  I am an Evil Dead fan, so this is good enough for now, especially if you can pick it up at $9.99 (it was that price on Amazon, back in December 2009). If you want a reference quality copy of the film on blu-ray, this is not it.
B0035V35P8|3.0|I came into Ninja Assassin with very low expectations.  That probably helped me have an overall positive impression of the movie.  Let me tell you what you can probably already guess:  the plot isn't anything deep or particularly compelling, the characters are stock, and the acting is just passable.  That said, it's a pretty fun action movie.    The fight scenes are well choreographed and employ an excellent blood effect.  Every swipe, severing slice, or star seems to unleash a half-gallon of blood from the target and it looks great.  The main character looks the part and the director does a great job composing the action sequences.      If you go in expecting Crouching Tiger then you will be disappointed.  If you go in expecting Blade then you will have a good time.  Just remember that whenever the characters start talking, that's a great time to get up for a drink or bathroom break.  They'll give you just enough time to get back before something interesting starts happening again.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Read this on the suggestion of my Mom, very good book, it is fairly easy with it being for kids/teens. I actually bought the entire series and finished all 5 in less then a week. If you read the Harry Potter series you will love this series just as much.
0679809015|5.0|I absolutely love this book!  I bought it for my 14mo old after seeing how much she loved her older brothers' lift-the-flap books.  She was way to rough to be able to play with the older kids books, so when I saw this one I just had to get it.  She loves it and I love that she gets to help open the flaps.  It's really sturdy, and its small size makes it so easy to toss in a purse or bag for on-the-go entertainment.  I've since ordered more chunky flap books, and have been searching for more.
B000Q9EPUG|5.0|If you love the games, and like to read you have to read this book along with the rest of the serious as I did, as I was reading I could picture every character and place in my head and when I was done I had to play the games again LOL
0061231401|4.0|No doubting to me that James Rollins owns the number one mantle when it comes to for action and adventure writing these days. His Sigma series is high octane, thrill-a-minute stuff that never fails to entertain, with the novels always focusing on interesting topics that in amongst the excitement and mayhem pose many a question in relation to our world - this novel for example having control of world food supply into the future as its main theme.<br /><br />One piece of advice to the writer from one of his fans - characters such as Painter Crowe, Grayson Pierce, the enigmatic Seichan and so on are pretty well developed by now, so I would hope that Rollins intends to bring the mysterious \\"Guild\\" more into the open in future volumes.

B00288KNJU|4.0|'Coraline' is another fine offering from the man who directed 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and James And The Giant Peach. The film has Tim Burton written all over it, but to my knowledge he had nothing to do with this sinister little film. I'm a sucker for Stop Motion Animation and 'Coraline ' delivers some excellent visuals that might put the little ones(under 10)in your bed every night for weeks after seeing it.  I bought the Blu Ray set and it looks and sounds fantastic, but the 3-D is disappointing as the color seems to be very off or washed out. I haven't seen any 3-D films that look right in my home, so maybe it's my home theater equipment? If you're a fan of stop motion animation and things that are macabre, then you should love the setting in this wicked little movie.

B002T9H2L0|4.0|I bought this Blu Ray set some time ago, but I wanted to forget the wide range of reviews I had read before seeing it. 'Inglorious Barsterds' is a very good film and I think Tarantino fans should especially like it. I think my biggest gripe with this film is the subtitles. It's not that I can't deal with them, but having scenes with long dialogue with so many written words at the bottom of the screen, was overall distracting and kept me from watching the scene. I know why the subtitles are used, but I think they could have used some clever ideas like in the first scene to break it up a little. I may not be the fasted reader on the planet, but I can hold my own. If you're watching this film, you had better be prepared to keep your eyes glues to the screen and don't even think of looking away to grab some popcorn for a second or you may lose some vital information. I know some lines were so long I could barely finish reading before I had another paragraph to read!<br /><br />Aside from the subtitles I think the film is beautifully shot and the acting by all is excellent. I enjoyed the story even though those \\"Basterds\\" aren't in the film as much as I would have liked them to be. I know some thought the length of the film was a bit long, but I really think the massive subtitling made it feel long. If I want to read a book, I'll read a book but when I watch a film I want to watch the actors expressions and actions. This film has so much subtitling that you can't really do that ,.....for those of you that can read a paragraph in a millisecond...my hat's off to you, but I think this film would have been better received by all, if they had found a way to switch to English more often. One of the joys of watching Tarantino films is to listen to his wonderful dialogue, not necessarily read it. Films like Schindler's List certainly didn't suffer from not using subtitles and I don't think this film would have either. The Blu Ray looks very good and there are some very good extras including alternate scenes, making of etc.ding alternate scenes, making of etc.
0545123267|5.0|This book flowed effortlessly and gracefully from Sam's perspective to Grace's perspective. I really loved the characters in this book, it felt like you really knew them.     I liked the way that she portrayed werewolves differently than most books. Like the fact that the temperature actually makes them change. I thought that she was just going to use the ideas from the many books about werewolves, but it was interiorly unique.    I can't wait for the much anticipated sequel Linger.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I have always known that there is something seriously wrong with the way the american food industry is being run. Unfortunately, when you live a busy life it can easily be pushed to the side, but when I saw this film I thought everyone should take the time to watch this film and get a small glimpse of what is really going on with our food. It is no wonder why so many diseases have taken a hold on our lives. Its truly terrifying to think that something as simple as eating a hamburger can kill you. We all have to eat and to think that we now have to add to the worry that the food we eat could potentially be harming us. I don't know about you, but I am prepared to make better choices for myself and my health and in turn my voice will be heard through my shopping habbits.....I better make them good! This film is a must see!!
0375413405|5.0|If you can follow directions, and are prepared to take the time and effort to follow them properly, then this book will guide you to some wonderful meals.  I give it 5 stars because that is the book's stated goal and it does it very well.    If you are after something quick and easy to eat then this may not be the ideal book.  Many (but not all) of the recipes will take significant time.  Perhaps it would be better to use another book for the everyday quick meals and keep this one for the special occasions.    Although these recipes do take time and effort, they are worth it.
B00009R6J7|5.0|I was finding the horizons in some of my sea shots in particular were off by a couple of degrees, and this little item has solved the problem completely.    It is very accurate, easy to read and fits the hotshoe of my Canon Powershot G11 well enough to allow completely accurate assessment in vertical and horizontal shots.  It's also very light, and a lovely design.    However, it is made of perspex, so the surface is quite delicate.  I handled it with insect repellent on my hands, and where I touched it, the surface has dulled.  It's still perfectly useable, but not nearly as pretty any more.    There are a couple of very minor problem with my setup - neither sufficient to reduce the rating from 5 stars though.  I'd definitely buy one again.  #1 It doesn't quite fit the hotshoe of my Canon Powershot G11 well enough to prevent it sliding out while I'm walking, so I have to remove it after each shot, or carry the camera with my thumb in position to hold it in place (easy enough on both counts).  #2  Also, and this is a problem with my camera software, not with the level - my camera won't allow exposure bracketing with the level in place on the camera (it interprets its presence as a flash unit, I guess, and disables exposure bracketing).  The workaround is to hold the level to the side of the camera while taking a photo, works fine.
B00275EGWY|5.0|Action film meets character study in Kathryn Bigelow's THE HURT LOCKER.  The film follows three members of an Army bomb squad (Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty, all excellent) as they bond and diffuse bombs.<br /><br />If the film has one main flaw, it's that there's no real plot; this will obviously be a deterrent to more mainstream war movie fans, who like bombs and bullets and blood, and not necessarily any sense or heart.  It will also be a disappointment to those who want a film that glorifies the war in Iraq, or those who want a film that demonizes it.<br /><br />And yet, it is these three main points that make THE HURT LOCKER such a treasure.  It isn't just bombs and bullets; yes, there are those, but this is a movie with heart.  Likewise, it isn't a \\"war\\" film per say; it is a human film, about the people who fight the war.  It actually manages not to take a political stance, which is a move so tedious I previously thought it impossible.  The film is about the characters (specifically Renner's Staff Sergeant James) and how they cope with their environment, and why they do what they do.  In fact, when something resembling a plot pokes its polished head in the second half, the film actually falters; but we quickly get back to the characters themselves, and everything ends on a high note.<br /><br />Needless to say, Bigelow's come up in the world.  We're talking about the director responsible for POINT BREAK, one of those action films (many of which star Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, or Gary Busey, come to think of it) that's only good because of how bad it is.  However, the directing behind LOCKER is spot-on; it feels real, it puts you on location.  The script by Mark Boal (the scribe behind the slightly more political, but still excellent, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH) is likewise solid, and the special effects are so real they're frightening.  Of course, a film couldn't be good without solid performances, and we get those here from everyone involved, from the three leads to cameo roles by Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Guy Pearce, and others.  THE HURT LOCKER winds up being one of those rare movies that is both vividly entertaining and emotionally powerful; it has genuine staying power.  If you want to watch an unbiased look at war, you could do a lot worse than this film.to cameo roles by Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Guy Pearce, and others.

0805091742|5.0|I just finished reading Atul Gawande's latest book, THE CHECKLIST MANIFESTO.  I strongly recommend everyone with an interest in improving performance in situations running from simple to complicated to complex read this book immediately - it can be finished in a few hours, running a double spaced 200 pages.    Gawande lays out the convincing case for using checklists in areas as different as aviation, building, restaurant meal preparation, surgery (and medicine in general) and finance.  Checklists are developed with an eye towards preventing failure in complex tasks.  Important features of all the checklists in complicated situations is building in checkboxes for communication and teamwork, as well as 'pause points' during which all team members have a conversation about the process and any unusual situations.  Finally, he dramatically illustrates the importance of decentralizing decision-making power in a crisis with the example of Wal-Mart's extraordinary effort during Hurricane Katrina, which began with CEO Lee Scott issuing a simple edict:  \\"This company will respond to the level of this disaster; a lot of you are going to have to make decisions above your level.  Make the best decision that you can with the information that's available to you at the time, and, above all, do the right thing.\\"  This gave license to employees to make decisions that had a dramatically positive effect on their communities.    He emphasizes that in each of these professions, we have gone well past the era of the expert in charge - the \\"master builder\\" who knows everything about architecture and engineering, or the test pilot with \\"the right stuff\\" who could manage the complexity of flying aircraft.  We have to rely on checklists and procedures to limit failure and manage crisis, and teamwork/communication to achieve the best outcomes.    The surgery checklist involved 19 steps before, during, and after surgery, with such basics as antibiotic use and blood availability taken care of in communication.  The checklist was studied in 8 hospitals around the world, from poor to middling to wealthy countries, and overall, mortality and complications dropped by a third to a half.  I believe he said that all but one hospital had double digit improvement.  Lives were saved.  This is hands-down revolutionary, folks.    He also uses the timely illustration of the \\"Miracle on the Hudson\\".  Yes, Captain Sullenberger was very experienced, but the reason for their success was the fact that they were well equipped to deal with system failure, with checklists on hand to cover exactly this sort of emergency and a team that had communicated beforehand and knew each other.    It's a fascinating - and moving - read.  I found myself deeply touched by the examples of lives saved by the simple but vital vigilance that checklists provide.

My guess is when the first presses sold out, someone in China thought they could make allot of money making copies of the sold out, highly sought after Mono box set. So, check you sources very carefully.  If the price seems to good to be true, you could be dealing with an inferior bootleg version of these box set.  No sense in describing the details between the real and fake versions, because it you buy a fakes it's too late anyway! So be VERY careful....

I also felt that the description of the characters didn't fit the time period. It felt to me like the characters belonged in the 1940's. While it may sound like I didn't like this book, I did enjoy the story. It is very predictable, but still enjoyable. The last 100 pages were more interesting and kept my attention. All in all, I would suggest this book to those that enjoy romantic stories by Sparks. I think you have to be his fan in order to like this one.
B000021Y7X|5.0|What can I say after watching this video?  OMG.  This is what the 80's were all about.  David Byrne's opening number just starts the onslaught of what is to come to you visually as well as vocally.  Mr. Demme is indeed brilliant at directing this very entertaining DVD of the Heads.  I can laugh about their outfits now, but they were cool in the 80's I remember.  I bought this video after reminiscing about the Heads, and recalled watching it back in the 80's when it was VHS. I just had to have this DVD as part of my collection. Reliving my youth I guess you could call it.      It is an outstanding portrait of what the Talking Heads were all about.  I still hear these same songs on my classic rock stations here in Pa.  Just watch the manic pace of the Heads under the mastery of David Byrne's vocals and actions.  I urge you to get this DVD if you are a Heads fan. The Big Suit is worth the price.  The songs are great and they are played by a very talented group of individuals. You will not be sorry.
B002PAQEU8|3.0|First, I am a die-hard Sterephonics fan. Kelly Jones could sing the phone book and I'd probably buy it (wait...he sort of did sing his personal phone book in the solo project \\"Only the names have changed, and yes, I bought that). After the amazing reviews for the new album, I was looking forward to my import. Well, I've listened three times through, and while it certainly has improved, it is not their best to date. That would certainly have to be \\"You've Got to Go There to Come Back.\\" If you disagree with me, have your ears professionally cleaned and run the CD through your hifi several more times.    The import is beautifully packaged in an oversize booklet that makes you think you've mistakenly ordered the box set. The pictures and lyrics are so nice to see, and recalled the great vinyl albums of the last generation. More artist should do this: I would GLADLY pay for this type of release. I was thrilled to get the DVD...until I tried to play it in my DVD player and it was rejectd, probably because the DVD has Euro region codes which don't work in the States. While this may make sense for a movie it does not on an accompanying music bonus. Sigh...will have to jury rig this somehow on my computer.     \\"She's Alright\\" opens the album with a great catchy guitar and bass line. But after two times through the chorus, I'm thinking it is kinda gimicky: \\"She's alright she's alright she's alright\\" Ok, I get it. She's alright. A few less \\"She's alrights\\" would have made this tighter, but I still like the overall energy and bounce of this cut. The next song, Innocent,  is classic Sterephonics anthemic rock, but softened up for the masses. It would be right at home on a Friday Night Lights episode. And that's probably my main beef with this album. Too many songs on thi album try to replicate this anthemic, crisp style. Where's the whisky addled blues riffs ala \\"Since I told you its over\\" or I Miss You Now? Instead, the closest we get is the slightly less anthemic \\"Live and Love\\" which, besides 100mph, is probably the best song on the album.  \\"Beerbottle, Trouble, Could You be the One, I Got Your Number, and Uppercut leave me feeling the same way I do after listening to a ColdPlay album, where every song is only a slight deviation of the others. Nice and pleasant, but it doesn't rock you the way \\"Leaving Las Vegas 2x\\" does, nor does it grab your ears and make you listen the way Devil does, or make you shriek with joy and turn your invisible amp to 11 the way Help Me did.    Personally, I think it's hard to eclipse You've Got to Go there (though Just Enough Education certainly gives it a good run for best Sterephonics Album), but since Pull the Pin, the Phonics have moved away from their rock-blues-pop roots towards a more mainstream sound that may work better in a stadium, and makes the tweeners and teens hold their arms up and sway along, but these style of songs utimately lose something in the transition to stadium rock. I suspect this album, much like Pull the Pin  and Language Sex Violence (excepting the amazing Superman and Devil), will end up towards the middle/bottom of my Phonics pile.     Which, compared to their contemporaries, is still a damn good pile.
0439023483|5.0|I finished this book in 2 days. I just couldn't put the thing down! It was a very different story line than anything I have read before.  It is so hard to find decent books these days, but this was clean enough that I could let me daughter read it.  She also loved it and we are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the 3rd book.
0385504225|4.0|After The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons, Dan Brown gives us a third adventure with his popular character Robert Langdon, Harvard professor and religious history and ancient symbols expert. (Think Tom Hanks, who, with director Ron Howard, is probably gearing up for another film version as I write this). This time, Brown takes us on a nerve-wracking romp through Washington, D.C. as Langdon tries to decipher symbols and secrets of the American Masons before they can be misused by an evil force. As usual, Brown offers a virtually artless writing style, but this hardly matters because his story is completely plot-driven and this book, like his previous ones, is a real page-turner. Brown may not be a Charles Dickens or a John Steinbeck when it comes to written expression, but he does know how to construct a good story. Chapters bounce back and forth between exciting predicaments and flash back to earlier events and provide background on various characters. (There are so many cliffhangers in this story that it easily could have run as a week-to-week serial in a newspaper as was the custom for introducing numerous 19th-century novels).   As in all the Brown novels, this one has a psychotic, homicidal bad guy who is trying to foil Langdon's clever efforts to unravel perplexing clues and riddles so he can reach the treasure first and use it for his own evil purposes. This time, the nemesis is a megalomanical tattooed madman who thinks he can gain the map to the Ancient Mysteries and thereby transform himself in to a god. He is one baaaaaaad dude, and never, since I read the Left Behind series wherein the antagonist is the Antichrist himself, have I wanted so badly for the enemy to get his comeuppances. (Need I say that he does--big time?)   Some plot points call for a suspension of disbelief. For example, the nemesis first puts his evil plan in motion after he hears crucial information conveniently through a ventilation shaft. That's right. An inmate in a Turkish prisoneavesdrops on a conversation from the warden's office through a ventilation shaft. Okay.   Also, would the world as we know it really be ripped asunder if, as certain characters seem to fear, a videotape of detailed secret Masonic rites--bizarre though they may be--were loosed upon the Internet? I hardly think so.   Now, a criticism on character development: Readers were given a false buildup for the big Mistaken Identity revelation toward the end. What was said in earlier chapters was not just misleading (that would have been okay), but explained in a totally false way. Oh, well.   After the nemesis is dispatched, Brown uses characters Peter Soloman, a wealthy academic and 33rd-degree Mason, and his sister Katherine Soloman, a noetic scientist, to present a thought-provoking essay about the importance for respect for ancient holy wisdom and the connection between science and spirituality. Brown focuses on the various sites in the nation's capital, in particular, the Washington Monument and the Capitol Building, to suggest an historical and ongoing connection between American historic ideals and the ultimate spiritual destiny of mankind. His assertions about the Lost Word of the ancients will spark new respect for numerous great books of philosophy from the past--one in particular--and how it contains \\"a collection of untapped wisdom waiting to be unveiled\\" (489). The main theme of the book's last three chapters is that God favors mankind's understanding and continuing intellectual and spiritual development. Katherine, who has discovered, among other startling scientific facts, a method to quantifiably weigh the human soul (that's right), continues the discussion of human apotheosis, suggesting the possibility of men reaching complete spiritual maturity (498). These last 20 pages or so are so interesting that they are worth the whole lengthy read.
B00004Z4WR|2.0|About what you would expect from Nicolas Cage in a Jerry Bruckheimer production.  Good amount of stars in the film, but they are saddled with a ridiculous script, saying some of the dumbest lines this side of a Seagal movie.  Prepare to turn off your brain before viewing this one.

0792844882|5.0|I saw this whole movie on my tee-vee without once disgustedly grabbing the remote to angrily look for something else to watch, or even thinking of it. From beginning to end, it was what I have to call a kick-a** entertaining movie: The plot, the action, the acting, the heroine, her rival, the nice-best-friend, the pacing, the originality of everything in it including the approach to cliches. Everything, I guess, except the wannabe club choreographer who seemed only included to broaden the panorama for audiences, but he didn't get in the way too much either. In a \\"serious\\" movie, that artsy loser character would have dominated the story, I've seen it happen. There was nothing in \\"Showgirls\\" for the viewer to endure in the way of cringe-inducing scenes of men forcing repulsive intimacies on women, sickening and protracted, with the woman pathetically just taking it, as you see in so many \\"serious\\" movies. The one horrible scene of force was dramatically significant, anything but gratuitous, and played exactly right, no more or less than what it is, no crawl-under-your-chair prolonged nastiness for shock's sake by a sadistic self-admiring director, as would be the case in a \\"serious\\" movie containing such a scene. The retribution for the crime wasn't enough, but it never is, and it was a lot more than we usually get--and probably all our heroine could reasonably get away with. This movie had no tonsil-boxing with amplified slurping noises--I cannot sit through any scene that has that--and gee, I wonder how the director resisted being \\"serious\\" by having a slam-up-against-the-wall, groping gasping upright sex scene? No wonder some people just find the movie ridiculous! It lacked so many tired hallmarks of Good Cinema.<br /><br />Now to the acting: fantastic, Oscars to everyone! The two main (women) characters were great, their lines and interaction fascinating, beautifully subtle, well-written and wonderfully delivered. Nomi's smile right before she let fly with her \\"reply\\" to that hypocrite she was having the affair with: PRICELESS! Would that I could smile exactly like that when I'm that hurt and mad. Putting myself in the shoes of the snot-nosed recipient of Nomi's menacing smile in that scene, I quake in my socks, and so should he have. Oh yeah, and the casting was 110%. Everybody rocked, nobody was even one hair off. Another hallmark of the averagely accepted \\"serious\\" movie is to miscast for the roles as much as possible, just making sure all the biggies in the business get to be in it, suitable or not. In fact, unsuitable is often better. It's so cool and exclusive to do that. We love looking up to exclusivity. Biggies in the business love looking DOWN FROM exclusivity (Ms. Goldie Hawn and whoever else) at others.<br /><br />\\"Showgirls,\\" the whole nudy, soft-porny movie simply was not revolting to me, was the opposite of that, and I'm having a tough time trying to pinpoint why that is. The sheer military-commando physical condition of Nomi Malone in the notorious NC-17 signature scene was more jaw-dropping than shocking. So was the whole fun movie. I'm giving it 5 stars to try and counterbalance a fraction of the pompous snots who hate it just because they think they are supposed to.that hypocrite she was having the affair with: PRICELESS!

0783229364|3.0|I ask you what is the real difference between the  two characters played by Michael J. Fox.  In Family Ties he plays Alex P. Keaton a young Republican bent on achieving corporate power and success.  In this film he plays Brantley Foster, a seemingly nice young man bent on achieving corporate power and success.  Where does the one character end and the other begin?  Perhaps the difference in what they are willing to do to climb the corporate latter.  Brantley Foster is as ambitious as Alex P. Keaton but does not possess his right wing zeal.  The question is once he reaches the very top of the corporate food chain will he be any better than Keaton.  He is more likeable, sure?  But he is really any tetter.

B000TEUSJK|2.0|I was expecting a little more sex, a little less history. It's pretty slow-moving and somewhat lengthy. I still watch it, but only for certains scenes. But for what it was in the year of it's release, I'm sure it was amazing. By today's standards, it's a little too long with not enough action to hold one's interest through the whole thing.
0689870280|5.0|I happen to love this book. It isn't because it says anything particularly amazing - I'm just attached to it since we read it for every nap. We got it at Christmas, when my baby was nine months old, and she's since began really looking at every page (which the lap size is nice for, as she can easily see it all). It's easy enough that you can memorize it, which comes in handy for those times when I need to speed through the \\"naptime routine\\" and get her down more quickly.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|What can I say? I liked the film. This seems to be Scorsese's first foray into the \\"pyschological thriller\\" genre and I think he pulls it off fairly well. It's not a perfect film, and probably not all that original, but it's suspenseful and disturbing and it provoked a significant emotional and intellectual response from this reviewer. There's some interesting cinematography as well. It would be hard not to sympathize with DiCaprio's character Ted Daniels, a US Marshal who travels to an island in 1954 Boston harbor to ostensibly investigate an escaped mental patient. Upon his arrival, of course, things get a bit fishy, and we soon learn about Daniels' own tortured history which becomes inextricable from his work. From there, there's a few twists and turns which ultimately end in a fairly surprising and satisfying denouement. A good thriller and an insightful peek inside the world of the mentally ill.
0812973992|5.0|What a fabulous book! If you know Colum McCann's other work, then you know him to be a lyrical, entrancing writer, whose use of language is original and immensely satisfying and whose stories are also original and immensely satisfying. Mr. McCann is Irish, but he writes American stories that could only be written by one has had to observe us, and in doing so come to know us better than we know ourselves.  That might sound trite, but when you read the book, you'll know what I mean.  Mr. McCann shows an America that gleams, and even when it is corrupt, damaged and in pain, he gives us characters who are alive on the page, multidimensional, people we could know and might even want to.  So now comes Let the Great World Spin, a novel about 9/11 that gets its power from when the Towers were still standing and the people affected by another event involving them, when Philippe Petit walked on a tight rope between them in 1972.  As the links between the characters are forged, McCann develops a deep bass line that compels us toward our other 9/11 memories. This book is a triumph, deserving all the accolades it has received.
0446402397|4.0|This was a difficult book to read, so a caution to fellow readers: if you're the least bit squeamish, this book is probably not for you. The situations and descriptions of life in Stalin Russia (where the book takes place) are often chilling, horrifying and at times even gruesome. Having said that, it was an extremely well written book and the author did a superb job of evoking a sense of time and place, making you feel as if you're right there. Leo is a high-ranking MGB official who never questions his duties or his loyalty to the State. Until an interrogation goes wrong, when he's stricken with remorse and begins to question everything - his purpose, his blind faith in the government, even his marriage. He also begins to wonder about another recent investigation where a young child was killed in what the government insists was a tragic accident, but in reality was a murder. When Leo suspects there is a serial killer on the loose, he and his wife Raisa become the hunted. As his frantic search for the killer escalates, so does the peril they are constantly placed in. The plotting and pace are relentless and will keep you on the edge of your seat until the shocking climax. A powerful book.

B001FB55I0|3.0|Two very different movies are happening at the same time in Terminator Salvation, one of which is much more interesting than the other.  Usually when this happens it means that a producer liked a previous draft well enough to keep its elements, but a later writing team couldn't integrate them well enough into the script as a whole for them to make sense.  The first movie stars Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood, as well as Yelchin, and is the more interesting of the two.  The characters are more fleshed out than in the other film, and through Marcus Wright we see an aspect of Skynet that we haven't before.  The second movie stars Christian Bale, and is not nearly as interesting.  In many ways, John Connor is essentially along for the ride.  I don't understand this, given that John Connor is supposed to be the leader of the resistance, and a charismatic leader; you'd think he'd be the focus of the movie.  Bale's Connor is bland and unapproachable, through no fault of Bale; the script gives him very little to work with.<br /><br />On the bright side, there isn't much here that's going to tick you off if you're a fan of the Terminator movies, unlike certain aspects of T3 that made me want to chuck a shoe at my TV.  On the down side, after it's over, my reaction was \\"huh, so that was it,\\" instead of, \\"that was really cool.\\"  When a movie with killer robots, time travel, Helena Bonham Carter, a nuclear war, and some Road Warrior cars elicits that kind of response, it has failed in its mission.<br /><br />This is fine as a rental, but I wouldn't add this to my permanent collection.
0061440795|5.0|Jealousy and insecurity can often lead us to commit cruel acts that we later regret. Although this coming of age story was written in the 1950's and by a young woman who was not much older than her own heroine, it's a plot that resonates with anyone who has ever felt responsible for restoring the status quo within their immediate family. The fact that the divorce rate has increased significantly in the last half century means that more offspring than ever before are dealing with parents who are breaking up, re-entering the dating pool, and (horrors!) marrying new people without their children's permission. At the same time, the youth themselves are desperately trying to define themselves emotionally, spiritually and sexually. While today's teens may snicker at the \\"scandal\\" of Francoise's fictional counterpart's yearning to leave childhood innocence behind, the underlying message about the consequences of tangled webs and deception is timeless.

B002UJIY7A|4.0|I'm a sucker for island-adventure stories like &#34;Mysterious Island,&#34; &#34;Robinson Crusoe,&#34; &#34;Six Days Seven Nights&#34; and numerous others (heck, even Gilligan's Island), which explains my interest in 2009's &#34;A Perfect Getaway.&#34;<br /><br />THE PLOT: Two newlyweds (Steve Zahn and Milla Jovovich) set out to enjoy their honeymoon hiking the incredibly scenic Kaua'i, Hawaii. Unfortunately they catch word that a crazy murderous couple is on the loose and they become seriously suspicious of other hikers (Timothy Olyphant and Chris Hemsworth, amongst others). Will they escape their honeymoon alive?<br /><br />&#34;A Perfect Getaway&#34; is worthwhile if, like me, you enjoy island-adventure movies. The film was shot at Kaua'i, Puerto Rico and Jamaica (the sea cave sequence) and these locations are spectacular. Also, the character played by Timothy Olyphant and his babe (Kiele Sanchez) are likable and you can't help but start to root for them by the time the third act roles around. Olyphant is &#34;outstanding.&#34; Chris Hemsworth (Thor) is also impressive as a grim/laconic badaxx hiker in a glorified cameo. Marley Shelton easily wins the Best Babe award, but her role is too small and the filmmakers fail to take advantage of her presence.<br /><br />Everyone knows by now that this is a 'twist' film and consequently the story takes a jarring turn in the final act. I'm not going to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it. I recommend seeing &#34;A Perfect Getaway&#34; if you like island flicks or films with surprising plot twists (or both). See if you can figure out the twist before it happens. I did and will explain below why it was easy. However, let me humbly add that I didn't have it figured out 100%; I just suspected the twist and that's how it turned out.<br /><br />The film is good for what it is, but there are a couple of things that turned me off. One has to do with the twist, explained below. The other has to do with the film being a whodunit thriller. By it's very nature the story has to cast suspicion on several characters and, as such, they are often portrayed in a negative or weirdo light, which doesn't change until the third act when the real murderers are revealed. In short, there's just too much negative energy amongst the players, but this is somewhat offset by the impressive redemption of a couple of the characters in the third act.<br /><br />GRADE: B-<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read any further unless you've seen the film<br /><br />We discover in the third act that the main protagonists played by Zahn & Jovovich are the murderers and that they're actually impostors of a recently murdered newlywed couple. The reasons I was able to figure this out was because (1.) I knew beforehand there was going to be a plot twist and so was looking for it and (2.) in a murder-twist scenario it's usually the most innocent/vulnerable persons who are guilty (e.g. &#34;Howling V: The Rebirth&#34;). Twist films like this have now become so common that they're no longer even surprising. What would really be refreshing and 'cutting edge' is if the film simply played it straight, i.e. the people we think are the protagonists remain the protagonists throughout and the suspicious/evil people get their comeuppance (&#34;Cape Fear&#34; is a good example).<br /><br />My problem with the twist is that it makes the whole story a lie -- the very people we come to care about and root for in the first hour end up being despicable criminal scum of the lowest depth (at least Zahn's character anyway) and the suspicious characters that we're led to believe are the murderers end up being the protagonists we should care about. To the film's credit we DO end up caring about Olyphant's character and his girl by the end of the story.<br /><br />Yes, I realize that in a way the film isn't lying to the viewer once the characters played by Zahn and Jovovich are understood to be the murderers. When this is understood, most (maybe all) of their conversations are authentic as the impostors/killers but not as the innocent newlyweds, if you know what I mean. It's all a matter of perspective. But, still, this doesn't take away from that fact that the viewer has essentially been baited and switched -- the very people we think are the innocent/vulnerable protagonists end up being the guilty/malevolent scum bags. Consequently, the viewer can't help but feel hoodwinked by the end of the picture.innocent newlyweds, if you know what I mean. It's all a matter of perspective.

B002UZCJP2|4.0|Okay, so obviously this film is a bit divisive. The critics by and large were not kind to it, and there are quite a few reviewers here that agree with them. For my part, I liked it.<br /><br />The story is intriguing and kind of plausible - if human beings could be Sims, would we? I'm inclined to think yes. I'm a bit skeptical that our becoming Sims would lead to some of the places the writers posit (Reduced crime? Really? Human-only reservations within major US cities free from the jurisdiction of the FBI? Um, what?), but you don't have to buy into every facet of a science fiction world before you can feel at home within it generally.<br /><br />Without giving away too much, this story is a clash of Titans - pro-Surrogate/anti-Surrogate, duking it out - and Bruce Willis is an FBI agent swept up into it who (and I really like this part) just doesn't bog down in the details. There's enough exposition from the people around him to fill out the major outlines for the audience at home, but Greer/Bruce is living in the moment. He (and his story) waste little time pondering the wherefores and hows of these Titans. He's dealing with the fallout, trying to find out just enough to do what he needs to do, filtering it all through his emotions. As a result, some parts of the film feel sketchy...really, pretty much like life. We don't often get the big picture, and it's a bold general audience film that follows suit. Kind of a _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead_ for the action crowd; you just know that if the story had been told from the perspective of, say, The Prophet it would have been a very different tale.<br /><br />Are you going to like it?<br /><br />Well. If you like a neat, fully explained story, probably not. If you like clearly defined heroes and villains, you might not like it, either. You're hard pressed to find somebody in this story who doesn't seem to think that the ends justify the means. But if you like an interesting idea with competent execution, a kind of brisk-paced action adventure with a well-portrayed character at the margins of a much larger story, you might.ure with a well-portrayed character at the margins of a much larger story, you might.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Released in 2008, “Quantum of Solace” is the second Bond film with Daniel Craig as Agent 007. Bond seeks revenge for the death of his babe in the previous film as well as those responsible for an assassination attempt on M (Judi Dench). The trail leads from Italy to Haiti to Bolivia and Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a world-renowned developer of green technology. Greene is intent on securing a barren area of Bolivia in exchange for assisting General Medrano stage a coup there (Joaqu&iacute;n Cosio). Since the CIA looks the other way, only Bond stands in Greene's way with assistance from a retired spy and two beauties (Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton). M wonders if she can trust Bond or if his need for vengeance has corrupted him.<br /><br />Daniel Craig makes a great James Bond and I appreciate the serious vibe of his installments. The problem with &#34;Quantum of Solace,” the 22nd Bond film, is the rapid-fire editing during the action scenes. Take, for instance, the opening chase-sequence that takes place on the tollway that leads through mountain tunnels from Nice through Monte Carlo and down to Portofino in Italy. It's a spectacularly scenic area. Unfortunately you won't see much of it here, just quick flashes; more importantly, you'll hardly understand what's going on due to the moronic fast editing. The camera switches about 3 or 4 times per second! I have no doubt that the filmmakers think such quick angle changes convey energy, but when it's done this fast all it does is confuse, disorient and annoy the viewer. It wouldn't be so bad if this was the only sequence put together like this but, no, after Bond's initial meeting with M (Judi Dench) there's another ridiculous rapid-fire action scene.<br /><br />The filmmakers need to get a grip on this fact: James Bond is not a mindless action hero! He's too smart for that. He's the ultimate 'cool' attitude. Violence for him is an irritation resorted to only when necessary. He exists for the mental play, the checkmate and, later, the martini – shaken, not stirred; the babe too, of course. The only way the average viewer can successfully make it past the 25-minute mark of &#34;Quantum of Solace&#34; and enjoy the movie is if s/he drinks a pot of heavily-caffeinated coffee beforehand.

0380789035|3.0|A basic summary of American Gods:<br /><br />Shadow, having just been released from prison, is on his way to his wife's funeral when he meets up with a mysterious man who calls himself Wednesday among many other names. After agreeing to join up with Wednesday, who offers him a job as a sort \\"errand boy\\", Shadow finds himself immersed in a world of living Gods and Goddesses, all of which have been brought to America long ago by immigrants who believed in them, but have been forgotten and left to fend for themselves as their worshipers died away and people started to worship new things and create new gods (such as the God of automobiles and media). Wednesday and Shadow run around the country trying to rally the old Gods together to fend off the \\"coming storm\\".<br /><br />I was pretty disappointed. I normally like Neil Gaiman, but this wasn't his best effort. Although I like the idea he was working with, by the end of the book I was left feeling like nothing really happened at all. Yes, I got the plot twist and there was a resolution to the story, but it feel flat for me. Honestly, I couldn't have cared less about the main character, Shadow. He was so boring. Here he is, walking and talking with Gods for the very first time in his life, and yet he seemed like it was something he saw everyday. And throughout the entire book he seemed half-asleep, except towards the end during his \\"ordeal\\" (I don't want to give anything away) when he finally started to get interesting. Yes, I know the character is supposed to be a bit emotionally unattached, but this was more \\"bored\\" than \\"dead inside\\". Frankly, I was much more interested in the minor characters, as well as some of the side stories about how some of the God's came to America (especially the one with the African slaves).<br /><br />It was, for the most part, entertaining and a page-turner, but I think with a premise like this Gaiman had a good opportunity to delve deeper into the American psyche and pull out some really interesting observations, but instead all I got was random sex stories, a half-assed \\"war\\" (if you can even call it that) story, a main character who wouldn't care if a bomb went off in his face, and the idea that Americans now worship the TV and Internet mentioned on every other page (in case you forgot the first three hundred times it was brought up). So, although it was entertaining, it was shallow and gimmicky. I wouldn't read it again, and I wouldn't recommend it.but instead all I got was random sex stories, a half-assed \\"war\\" (if you can even call it that) story, a main character who wouldn't care if a bomb went off in his face, and the idea that Americans now worship the TV and Internet mentioned on every other page (in case you forgot the first three hundred times it was brought up).

B00127RAJY|5.0|I started this excercise program 6 days ago and I have never felt better and I am noticing that my clothes are fitting better. I agree it is a tough program to start. To all of those who are whining about it being unsafe, if you pay attention, you can do modified version of the excersises, not that complicated to figure out. This way you wont hurt yourself. I do a lot of the modified versions as well as the advanced, and I never felt better. Jillian is awesome, and the show proves how good she is. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good workout. If you're lazy and complain about it, then it's not meant for you.
0547258305|5.0|In Graceling, Cashore has created a world where people can be \\"graced\\", gifted with some great skill, and then marked by having two different colored eyes.  Graces range from the useful, such as cooking and mind reading, to the useless, like twisting one's torso around.  Katsa's grace is a deadly one...she is the most skilled fighter in all of the kingdoms.    Graceling follows Katsa's journey to solve a kidnapping mystery.  It is also a journey that leads her to truly understand the nature of her grace and marks her passage into adulthood.  Katsa is very relatable, and she is one of several interesting characters.  We also are lucky enough to meet Po, another graced warrior Katsa encounters in the story.  Both are unique, and Katsa in particular is a wonderfully strong young woman.    The mystery in attention-grabbing, but I found the world that Cashore created to be what really created a pull.  I look forward to reading the companion novel, Fire, and can only hope that Cashore also revisits Katsa's life someday as well.

With only three days left until the sun sets for six months, Carrie races to solve the complex mystery before darkness falls.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer, the film is entertaining up to a point.  The \\"cold weather\\" is a character itself in the film, since many dramatic scenes take place outside.  These are filmed very well by the director.<br /><br />I liked the first \\"2 reels\\" of the film (the first hour)...by the 3rd reel (last 30 minutes) the plot starts to feel forced, and the ending was anti-climatic.
0743277457|5.0|Ok, I'm not really comparing this book to Herman Hesse's Siddhartha. Siddhartha is a classic in literature and I don't mean to falsely compare. Although, there is an interesting parallel. Some reviewers think that this book is too narrowly focused on Mr. Waitzin's experiences. Others believe it to be too amorphous. Either way, if one believes either of the opposing views then Siddhartha (and a lot of other classics) would hold absolutely no value to them.    Some of us already know some of the truths in this book. We've applied them throughout our lives. But maybe we didn't consciously recognize them. As such these truths would be hard to improve upon or pass on to others. It is also valuable to hear them enunciated by another. I plan to buy this book for 4 friends. It is my hope that this book will provide some introspection for them to continue their accomplishments. I don't doubt these same people would continue to excel but it is useful to have a coach point to areas of focus and other paths to learning.    Yes, this book is \\"vague\\" in some respects. If you are looking for a book on mental tricks to learning and a step-by-step guide then this book is not right for you. You are looking in the wrong area. If you want more personal advice then you probably need to enlist a coach of the type used by Mr. Waitzkin and other top performers. This book is more along the lines of \\"Chess Praxis\\" than \\"Bobby Fisher Teaches Chess.\\"    Take this book as an introduction to improving your performance in any endeavor and life in general.  As someone that also values mental and physical pursuits I value the cross pollinated discussion of the two.
B00004VVNB|3.0|I'm sure this was cutting edge for its time, but it has flaws that seem obvious now. In this movie a post-apocalyptic society survives, sealed off from the outside world under giant domes. In order to keep some kind of balance in the population no one is allowed to live past 30 unless they \\"renew\\" in some bizarre ritual. Enforcers called \\"sandmen\\" kill people who attempt to escape.<br /><br />The mechanics of this whole thing don't seem to make sense. How big is this city, anyway? One of the organizations is \\"New You #436\\" or a number in that range. There are over 400 plastic surgeons?! And what do these people do all the time? No one other than the sandmen seem to have a job.<br /><br />It seems that most of the film's special-effects budget was blown on a model of the city. It looks like Ford's Transportation of Tomorrow exhibit at the World's Fair... but not as convincing.<br /><br />There's also a lot of nudity in this. Even some of the women who ARE wearing clothes are barely wearing them. Of course, I understand that for some people that's actually a plus.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|The Sixth season of Lost is just like the 1,2,3,4,5 is amazing, questions are answers, questions are made, twists, mythology, love, death... Everything that makes Lost great. The Blu-Ray edition will be the tip of the pyramid for any Lost fan, there really is no point for a review section on this page as everyone that loves Lost has already clicked the 'Pre-order it now' button.    So i'll fill my review by calling out all the idiots claiming its 'Too Confusing'... these people obviously don't watch Lost like others watch it. 'Confusing?' do you actually realise your watching 'Lost'. If you want television that doesn't keep you thinking, buy prison break or desperate housewives. For the rest of us who enjoy the mystery and are smart enough to understand how the show works and accept confusing situations (Which in the end, we'll have answers for). Take this blu ray and put it on the top of your collection.
0399224459|4.0|This is a wonderful few word but great story book.  My son received this book when he was six months old and I have since replaced it because the pages got so worn out from constant reading and looking at the pictures.  He loves this story and it has also helped him learn animals.  Great cute book to add to any collection.
B001GCUO5M|3.0|The plot is interesting at first and the first one hour fifteen will have you hooked. Di Caprio is good at first but soon you will find the movie goes into a very sketchy study of schizophrenia, war, guns, dark walls, island, revenge and disappearing acts in 1954.<br /><br />Let's talk about the director. Having done just about every sort of classic, Martin Scorsese seems to have made Shutter Island as a homage to Kubrick and Hitchcock. I read somewhere that this is a bit like a modern day shining. I beg to differ, The Shining had a good story while Shutter Island tries very hard to confuse and make sense at the same time. Some people might have even guessed the mystery, some people like me would have waited till the last scene only to be told something that would make sense but still seem a little lofty.<br /><br />Leonardo is Martin's favourite actor without a doubt. They have always made a great team but with Shutter Island, I found myself a little disappointed because it left me feeling a little robbed of a worthy end. The climax leaves too many things unanswered. I fear this movie is terribly slow and difficult to be watched at home so I'm glad I went to the movies. BEWARE of the loud pangs of horns and music that will hit you time and again, every time an ocean shot is shown.<br /><br />Gandhi, I'm sorry, Sir Ben Kingseley was a relief with a very clean little important role. The names will confuse you no end. Mark Ruffalo has done better films but I found his character quite meak though he gave it his best shot. From start to finish, the film centers around Di Caprio. He's in every single scene.<br /><br />What I liked about this film is how despite being slow it holds you by the end of your brain's wits. You will forget your life for that 2 hours and 30 minutes, you will switch your blackberry off and not want to speak a word to anyone. That disconnect truly highlights Scorsese's great potential for drama.<br /><br />This film is definitely beyond the attention span of my generation.
B001UV4XUG|2.0|I repeat my title:  artsy references do not make for depth.  Neither does a non-linear time frame, even if it is meant to evoke the way memory functions.  With as common a theme as he loves her/she loves him not, this should be a character driven drama to make the audience feel the emotional conflict.  The characters are too thinly drawn here to evoke that response.  Honestly, I knew more about Charlie Brown, Lucy, and the red headed girl from Charles Schulz's four panel cartoons than I do about the leads in this movie.  The direct camera interviews seem formulaic  after TV shows like \\"The Office.\\"  The narrator seems more like an apologist for this unsympathetic love affair than an omniscient voice.  The only reason I am giving this mediocre movie two stars is the charismatic lead actors.  I would like to see Zoey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in something more worthy of their talent.  (And per other reviews I read, this is no comparison to \\"Annie Hall.\\")
1594488843|4.0|Daniel Pink's Drive is a great example of a type of book popularized by Malcolm Gladwell.  These books generally set out to do the following: take a topic that is important but poorly understood by a large section of the public, summarize a diverse collection of research performed by others on the topic, and present the findings in a concise, readable summary.<br /><br />While highly popular, such books come in for criticism, much of which, I think, misses the point.  A book like Drive is not scholarship, but scholarship does inform it.  It is a simplification of a complex topic, but then a book on a topic like \\"why people do what they do\\"  _must_ be simplified if one expects to be able to lift it without a forklift.  In my opinion, Pink's book is a very good introduction to a topic that touches on so many aspects of contemporary work and leisure.  It's not the last word on the subject, but it is a good first word.<br /><br />As many others have described the contents, the simplified thesis of the research presented in Drive is that humans do things according to a hierarchy of motivational \\"operating systems\\".<br /><br />Motivation 1.0 - eat and reproduce or die.<br />Motivation 2.0 - Carrot and sticks.<br />Motivation 3.0 - Do things because they enhance one's autonomy, enable mastery of a valued skill, and contribute to a higher purpose.<br /><br />I read this with interest because my current employer, the U.S Army, is all too often an example of a Motivation 2.0 workplace.  The Army is in the midst of a self-examination of why it chronically fails to retain many of its most talented personnel.  Viewed through Pink's lens, most of the strategies the Army has traditionally employed to attract and retain talent center on Motivation 2.0: retention bonuses for signing up (carrots) and bad evaluations and non-promotion for under-performance (sticks).  When Soldiers are surveyed, the only Motivation 3.0 factor that they consistently site as a positive is the sense of higher purpose found in serving the country.  Common complaints are a lack of ability to exert any control over the direction of a career or a chance to specialize in a particular aspect of it (no autonomy or mastery, in Pink's formulation).  Up to this point, Drive does an excellent job of describing a problem in my \\"place of business\\", and I think that the lessons on how to create a more \\"3.0\\" workplace can be beneficially applied in both my small unit and the Army at large (if anyone will listen).<br /><br />That said, motivation is an incredibly complex topic, and it would be foolish to think a single book would cover all contingencies.  This theory of motivation is less adequate in how to deal with common problems like a) jobs nobody wants to do, b) assignments to locations where volunteers alone are not enough, and c) the true goldbricker, who is not enticed by autonomy, mastery, or higher purpose.  Here is where critics of Drive have a point.  While a simplified version of motivational science is to be expected, Pink is perhaps too quick to dismiss the problems of applying the tenets of Drive to the real world.<br /><br />So overall, an engaging book that will introduce readers to an important topic.  Worth the time.<br /><br />4 stars.untry.

006056251X|5.0|Something that I haven't found in a book in quite a while--a pleasing pace. The story moved along beautifully without getting bogged down by the heroine going through chapter after chapter of self perusal (which I really hate). It was a fast, light read that was entertaining and pleasant.    I had not read any of the other books from 'The Wallflowers' series so I had no preset expectations about the main characters. I found them realistic and delightful. The story did start to fizzle out toward the end and could have been wrapped up a little sooner, but it's definitely worth a reread on down the road.

It really is more of a SUSPENSE movie than horror.  I`m sick of all the special effects, excessive gore, loud music soundtracks and unnecessary sex scenes that are so persuasive in today`s movies. This movie does not rely on any of those tricks.  One of the best I`ve seen in a long long time.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I love all of Alicia Keyes music so it's not surprising that I love this collection of songs as well. I love how she gives the old school sound a new twist.

I've listened to this CD again and again and again.
B0000DCGT0|5.0|This film is one of the best to come out of the entertainment industry in decades.  It tells a story of a small horse who brings excitement, pride and determination to a nation put on its knees by a great depression.  This film will wrench your heart with the tragedies of life, but also warm you with laughter and knowledge that even in the toughest of times, we always find a way to survive and prosper.  It is a great story for younger people because the message contained in the story is told without reverting to the titilating themes of excess violence, sex and nudity, murder and mayhem.  Amazing that life can be fully lived and experienced and a story can be told without having to succumb to the taudry.

B002N1AERI|4.0|Okay, I will start out by saying I actually don't mind death metal and have a number of cd's of that genre.    I listened to this album a few times before coming to an opinion as I really wanted to like it.  In the main I do.  In the main I think this album is fantastic.  I love the newer guitar work, the solos and the songs.  I don't like the death metal vocals.  They are unconvincing and have been done far better in far too many other bands, IMO.  They sound, if anything, a bit cartoonish. My opinion is that, if you are going to do the beauty and the beast, as Epica have done, is to try and give the beast the same emotional power and ability as the beauty component.  Not easy I admit, and the standards I apply reflect that, but there are some male vocalists that would suit .... I am thinking My Dying Bride, or Theatre of Tragedy in their early days for starters.    Now, having said all that, and probably creating the impression I hate this album - which is not true, there are many redeeming features.  Simone's vocals are as good as ever, the music is varied enough to make it interesting.  The guitar work is excellent.  The male vocals may not have annoyed me so much if they were used more sparsely.  I will still listen to this album in the future, but my enjoyment will be somewhat tempered by its flaws.  I am in two minds as to give it 3 or 4 stars.  I will give it 4, but I strongly recommend listening to the samples, or the whole disc if possible, first, to make sure you that you don't find any issues, like I did.

1608201236|5.0|A most satisfying finish to the series.  Kudos Mr. L!    Mr. Lanyon's gift for bringing characters to life is exceptional.  Readers are able to connect immediately with Adrien and crew and, more importantly, witness the growth of the characters over time (and the four previous books), to a satisfying conclusion.    The mystery elements are well ploted and are an integral part of the story, either as a catalyst and/or a support to character development. Cliches are few, and the few that are present are mocked, -\\"Nazi treasure?\\"  \\"Oh Pulease!\\" - with glee.  Humor is used to counter balance the sobering realities of heart surgery, failed relationships, and murder.   The rich use of secondary characters, including Adrien's growing family and a suprising return, provides a full-bodied read.    The dialogue is crisp and rings with truth, allowing the reader to experience the protaganist's mental and emotional state.  Not an easy thing to accomplish, but Mr. Lanyon has the knack. This final volume is the strongest in the series.       On a personal note I found this last entry in the Adrien English Mysteries to be...right.  The word \\"right\\" may sound less than inspiring, but it suits this series.  Not every little thing was tidily resolved, but instead given a potential future.  It's up to the reader to plot the next adventure.  I like that.

0061120081|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee is an interesting, moving, and overall phenomenal novel. It faces the alarming but true problems of childhood and the prejudice of the justice system in 1930's. Harper Lee's novel is not only groundbreaking, but also heartwarming, mysterious, and disturbing in the way it shows the discrimination in the Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's.   The novel's setting and characters are brilliant due to Harper Lee's background knowledge on the many subjects covered in the book. Lee was, like Scout (the protagonist of the book a.k.a. Jean Finch) a girl living in small town Alabama in 1930's experiencing racism, with a father (Amasa Lee to Atticus Finch) who is a lawyer. Lee effectively uses her knowledge to her advantage.   To Kill a Mockingbird is a first person narrative from the child's eyes of Jean (mostly referred to \\"Scout\\") as Finch, a poor girl who spends her time with her older brother Jem Finch. One of the main points of the book is that her knowledge of bad in the world increases throughout the book, which I found fascinating. The novel is about their life growing up, and the evil in the world, including their father's case as defending an innocent African American by the name of Tom Robinson who is accused of sexually abusing Mayella Ewell.   The title, To Kill a Mockingbird, alone is excellent symbol shone throughout the book. It symbolizes the fight against good and evil. \\"Mockingbird\\" is a symbol for good, so the title symbolizes the many events in the story where something beautiful is killed. I do not want to mention an example though, for I do not want to spoil for those who have not read it.   Lee intelligently decides to show the story through the eyes of a child, and with this smart choice, we get to experience the horrors of racism in an interesting, effective, way. For the child's increasing knowledge of the evil in the world is amazing. The book accurately depicts the mind of a child so precise readingthe book felt like being a small child again and learning about the world.   Normally, this paragraph I would have reserved for the cons of the book, but I have sat thinking long enough to realize that the book has none, other than the fact that I sometimes (very, very occasionally) dozed off, but that can be blamed on my attention which is equivalent to a small stone, and not the book. This is no doubt the most interested I have been when reading a book in 2 years.   To Kill a Mockingbird is an excellent classic tale of humor, evil, innocence, discrimination, and more. Harper Lee's setting, story, and characters all extremely real feeling and fascinating. I highly recommend this book.    -James

B000UJ48VI|3.0|The movie \\"Lolita\\" is simply a fair film; and only if you understand the book.  In 1958 Hollywood was not permitted to investigate some of the themes Nabokov employed in the book.  Nabokov, agreed to write the screen play because naively he fancied that would have a chance of influencing the screenplay.  The final film and screenplay use almost none of Nabokov's work, and early in the process, it became clear that the screenplay would be written by Hollywood hacks and the movie would have little to do with the book.<br /><br />Sue Lyons looks nothing like the typical \\"nymphet\\" which Humbert/Nabokov carefully outlines in the beginning of the book.  Sue Lyons was a good actress, but was necessarily miscast for the movie ( e.g.,Lolita, in the book, was 12 years old).  Only in her final scene where she is pregnant and married does she look and play the part well.<br /><br />Also, there are now several different cuts of this movie. This is a lesser cut and is missing several great scenes with Peter Sellers.  Sellers Plays Claire Quilty and steals the movie.<br /><br />If you want to understand the book \\"Lolita\\"; buy the annotated version and the book \\"The Keys to Lolita\\".  Plan to read the book 3 or 4 times, taking the time to cross reference the literary illusions and read the passages slowly.  The book has NO sex scenes and it and is intended as a literary epic.  I have a degree in English Literature, yet it took me about 3-4 close readings of the book to even begin to understand \\"Lolita\\".  I have spent over 20 years reading this book and finding new things about the book each time.<br /><br />It's not only that 1958 Hollywood could no make a film of what most people THOUGHT \\"Lolita\\" was about, but that a literary masterpiece such as \\"Lolita\\" simply cannot be adapted to the screen.  \\"Lolita\\" is pure literature and MUST be read to obtain it's full force of writing genius.  I have no idea why Kubrick thought he could make a film version of such a book.  I can only conclude that Mr. Kubrick did not understand Nabokov or his wondrous book.  If you care anything about literature read the book as you would read James Joyce and expect no less.<br /><br />I wonder if Kubrick ever finally read the book and began to understand it's literary humour, puns, playfulness, dark wit, singular narrative unique to all of English literature?<br /><br />PS: The score by Nelson Riddle is the most under-rated part of the movie and worth owning on CD.

B002GQ74GE|5.0|If I had to catagorize Hiromi I would place her somewhere between Chick Corea and Gonzalo Rubalcaba. But what really sets her apart from other contemporary pianists is her ability to frustate anyone who attempts to place her in a pigeon hole. She is so emotionally connected with her music that she cries when she plays the title track \\"Place to Be\\" on the bonus DVD included with this import.  Hiromi's \\"Place to Be\\" is the theme song to a lovely but sad Japanese movie entitled \\"Invitation From Cinema Orion\\" [Orion Za Kara No Shotaijo].     If you like her CDs you will love her live. Her concert DVDs are spectacular expessions of her wonderful talent.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Will it change your life? No. Is it totally engaging? Yes!    The House at Riverton is a well written pleasant escape. It's a visit to life in an English country home, upstairs and downstairs, from the memory of an elderly woman. it's a costume drama with more substance than a traditional romance. It's not quite the creative exercise as The Forgotten Garden, but was a great way to spend a couple of snowy afternoons.
0307454541|5.0|Larsson has created a masterpiece that will save him a place in the pantheon of mystery and suspense novelists.  It is rare that a novel of such richness, complexity, and sheer readability graces this bookshelves of genre literature.  That this very satisfying read is part of a trilogy is more good news.  The sequels merely expand and improve on this first installment.<br /><br />With all that unreserved praise I am still even more awed with his creation of characters, with his \\"Girl\\" protagonist easily the most memorable character in suspense fiction since Hannibal Lecter.<br /><br />The world lost a masterful novelist before we knew he existed, but we have his three great novels to remind us of his talent.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This was a sort of suprise to me.  You know those books that as soon as you get it, you read it as quickly as possible? Well this is one of them.

B002QW7AJY|4.0|Part psychological thriller, part sci-fi, part [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens]], PANDORUM is a unique hybrid. Although nothing new in terms of things we haven't seen before (encapsulate a group of men/women and see how they react), the film is strung together differently enough to hold your attention. You never really know what's around the next corner.<br /><br />The story is pretty common: Earth is doomed. Spaceships are sent out to find a habitable planet. One of these ships has been lost in space for some time, and when ship's pilot #4, Bower (Ben Foster, [[ASIN:B000XRO3MQ 3:10 to Yuma]]), wakes up from a prolonged hyper-sleep, much of his memory is gone or scrambled. Slowly things begin coming into focus as he finds various clues about who and where he's at. And not long after his awakening, another pod opens up and spills out Payton (Dennis Quaid, [[ASIN:B0018CWW3C Vantage Point]]), a high ranking officer who's memory is just as screwed up.<br /><br />Bower is chosen to explore the ship, and getting out of their pod chamber is the first challenge since they're locked in for unknown reasons. Like giving birth, Bower squeezes through the canals of the ship's innards and is expelled onto what appears to be a dead ship. But he quickly runs into friends and foes. Some of the crew, it appears, have mutated and are cannibalistic. Others have had to do terrible things in order to fight and survive. All Bower wants to do is reactivate the ship's power systems and get to the bridge.<br /><br />And that's about as far as I want to go without producing any spoilers....<br /><br />There are several \\"jump-in-your-seat\\" moments that'll surprise the hell out of most viewers. And the darkness of the cold ship makes for some excellent atmosphere. The sound score also added a spooky quality to the production.<br /><br />Ben Foster has rarely let me down in his choice of roles, and Pandorum was no exception. His embattled and continually challenged character was pitched just right throughout the film. It was also one of the first times I'd seen him as a main character and I was pleased to see it. He's a great young actor.<br /><br />And I've saved the best for last: the filming. It was pretty amazing. Again, the dark qualities and claustrophobic shots were pulled off without feeling forced or contrived (something I can't say of all films ...like [[ASIN:B000JJ5F0W The Descent]]).<br /><br />Surprisingly this film got poor reviews and pretty much flopped at the box office (costing over $40 million to make but only grossing $10 million). Shame. It's actually better than you might think.he first times I'd seen him as a main character and I was pleased to see it. He's a great young actor.

0307269981|5.0|Larsson does the seemingly impossible--he improves on his masterful first novel in the series with this volume that expands our understanding of his characters, juggles even more story lines, and leaves us with a tremendous sense of anticipation for the concluding volume.<br /><br />If you have not yet discovered this great series, go back to volume one, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and get ready for the read of a lifetime for mystery buffs.  This trilogy truly ranks with the great achievements of the genre--the best of Doyle, Hammett, Chandler, and Macdonald.  The three novels deserve a place on your bookshelf beside \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" \\"The Maltese Falcon,\\" \\"Farewell, My Lovely,\\" and \\"The Chill\\" and--taken together--may even top that list.

6305428522|5.0|Directed by Robert Redford, Quiz Show immediately grabs your attention to the true story of the 1959 quiz show scandal.  The budding television invention began blossoming in the 1950s and the potential money made in advertising gave rise to cutthroat tactics to grab audiences.<br /><br />Viewers loved the game show TWENTY-ONE and ratings went up with intelligent bright contestants vied for big monetary gifts.  Geritol as sponsor also benefited with increased sales.  Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) a knocked out tooth with unattractive personality and looks was the reigning champion of the show.  He was intelligent and smart, but the big boy network wanted someone more handsome and appealing.<br /><br />Herbert Stempel was asked to take a dive for Charles Van Doren when ratings began to \\"plateau\\".  They bribed him and he reluctantly took the fall, though he felt betrayed.  His bitterness grew and he accuses the producers of rigging the show for advertising dollars.  As the scandal bubbled up through small cracks, Dick Goodwin, an investigator finally establishes the truth.  Charles Van Doren confesses before the Senate investigating committee to live up to the ethics taught by his esteemed father.  Both men teach at Columbia University.<br /><br />The truth comes out and the illusion of the ideal contestent is marred.<br /><br />Great acting, excellent director and compelling drama
B00030590I|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie when I first saw it as I love martial arts films and I think Jet Li is one of the best in this genre.  After learning more about Chinese history recently (my son study it two years ago in the 1st grade) and learning about the emperor who united China and created the terra cotta army, I now find so much more depth and understanding of the dramatic ending to the movie than I had experienced it when I first saw it, even though I found the ending fascinating, novel and thought-provoking even when I originally saw the movie.  There actually is a reference to this movie in the terra cotta warriors exhibit that was on loan to the US by China for about 2 years, and what I found thought-provoking about it years ago, is truly fascinating - though highly stylized fiction it can provoke a very interesting dialogue on the nature of nation-building and the history of China.  Not your typical martial arts, adventure film.
B001MW0J2Y|3.0|I really, really wanted to like this album.  I am confident that John Frusciante is one of our greatest living guitarists, clearly versed in funk guitar both technically and stylistically.  His Smile From the Streets You Hold, though sometimes painfully raw, is one of the most beautiful lo-fi records I have ever heard.  As one Amazon reviewer of that album put it, \\"good music is not always easy to listen to.\\"  Empyrean operates on the very opposite principle: it's easy on the ears, but with the exception of a couple tracks (\\"Unreachable\\" and \\"Central\\"), it doesn't have a whole lot of substance.  It may be the closest John will ever get to ear candy, but as responsible music listeners it is our job to look for the real music in there.    The first track, \\"Before the Beginning,\\" might sound interesting to some listeners, but to more experienced funk music appreciators (like Frusciante) it is a blatant rip-off of George Clinton's \\"Maggot Brain,\\" a classic emotionally charged guitar solo that should not be so freely imitated - at least, not without crediting its sources or advertising itself as an homage to the great master of funk.  \\"Before the Beginning,\\" however, is not able to match Clinton's free-flowing guitar verse, Frusciante's guitar work too caught up in the rigidity of his framework.  The song sounds a little guarded.  I'm sure many novel music appreciators will find this piece hauntingly beautiful, but for the rest of us it's hard not to draw unfavorable \\"Maggot Brain\\" comparisons.      \\"Unreachable\\" better matches the sounds of the expert funkadelics who have influenced Frusciante.  Although the former half of the song may be too pop-rock for some of his more eclectic fans, he tops it off with a warbled, face-melting guitar riff (my only complaint is that it's too short!).  This track alone may be worth the price of the album for some people.    Unfortunately, most of the other tracks on the album rely too heavily on special effects and don't really go anywhere.  \\"God\\" has a neat bass line, but you'll soon realize it's a one trick pony; the fantastic bass line in \\"Dark/Light,\\" beautifully rendered by Flea, is covered up by one of the tackier drum machine beats I've heard (a true WTF decision on Frusciante's part) and repeated to the point of exhaustion.    \\"Central\\" is my favorite track on the album.  It's repetitive, but unlike \\"Dark/Light,\\" its repetition is necessary to the development of the song and even meditative.  The guitar work is sophisticated and extensive without being too showy.  One of Frusciante's finer works for sure.    As brilliant as \\"Central\\" and \\"Unreachable\\" may be, they are surrounded by some pretty mediocre material, and for that reason I knock off two stars.  I'm also slightly offended by the George Clinton rip-off.  I would have thought a musician as talented as John Frusciante would be too classy for this sort of second-rate Funkadelic stuff.

He feels lost and aghast that his life was all a lie when his wife (Sari Lennick) asks for divorce,  he is tempted by a seductive neighbor, his unemployed brother's excapades, his children's rebellions (smoking pot, stealing money from his billfold), and getting tenure as a professor at a small college in Minnesota.

B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|In a near future, with the development of the robotic, mankind stays at home operating surrogates with their signature to live their lives in the outside world and resolving issues like racism, complex and safety and reducing crime rates. Only a few people live in reservations the traditional way of life without the use of substitutes. When the surrogates of a man and a woman are destroyed by a sophisticated weapon, the FBI agents Tom Greer and Peters are assigned to the case and sooner they discover that the operators have also died. Tom Greer goes further in his investigation and finds that there is a conspiracy involving the army, the company VSI that manufactures the androids, the FBI, The Prophet leader of the humans and the scientist that had developed the surrogate technology Canter. It's a great concept. The weaker point of this movie is the action. \\"SURROGATES\\" is one of those good sci-fi movies that will simply entertain those who are fans of sci-fi movies. Worth a rental.

B002MCJZHS|4.0|Xx's debut is just one of those things that doesn't make sense. Someone else could come up with a stripped-down, simple yet well crafted, retro yet contemporary Indy pop sound and it wouldn't work, but this album does. From start to finish there is a lean, clean, cool vibe, some angular, quirky lines, and the sounds fit together like a reverb puzzle. It's a very unified and coherent aesthetic, and it is not by accident; for me it works and is enjoyable. Like pretty much everyone else, I like the female voice and not so much the male one. While I have my favorites (like the first four tracks), the whole album is worth getting.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|During the presidential election of 1988, a teenager named Donnie Darko sleepwalks out of his house one night, and sees a giant, demonic-looking rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. He returns home the next morning to find that a jet engine has crashed through his bedroom. As he tries to figure out why he survived and tries to deal with people in his town, like the school bully, his conservative health teacher, and a self-help guru, Frank continues to turn up in Donnie's mind, causing him to commit acts of vandalism and worse.  The performances in this movie are exquisite. The talent in this movie is top notch and Gyllenhall is just amazing. People will either love it, or despise it with all their heart. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone who has a taste for dark humor and a desire to put the pieces of the puzzle together over and over, long after the movie has ended. You can't watch it only once.

0307387178|4.0|\\"So, there's this guy, and he decides to prance out into the uncivilised Alaskan bush, without even a compass. This is after doing away with $25,000, by the way. And, oh yeah, after a few months, we find him dead.\\" Now, could this man's life story possibly be given any dignity, told without any implications of insanity?    Well, it would appear Jon Krakauer has managed to do just that.    While Christopher Johnson McCandless (or Alexander Supertramp--ahem, let \\"changed his name to sever ties with his family and earlier life\\" be added to his list of accomplishments) would likely be regarded by most as another of the cocky young men for whom hubris beckoned death, Into the Wild was a study into his mind, uncovering what complex motives drove him to take his fatal journey into the tundra. And no, delusions of invincibility were not included in these.    Coherent within a world where adolescents all too often play the daredevil, what with their propensity for tackle sports, heroin, and anarchism, it is all too easy to dismiss McCandless  as another distressed youth lacking responsibility (not to mention rationality). But exactly what Krakauer did was to humanize this outdoorsy-magazine feature story, causing it to become more than a figure at which to poke fun. Reflecting the often deeply buried journeyman inside us all, this novel spun the tale of McCandless's life prior to his adventures; a life of academic excellence, parental skirmishes, bonding with pets; a life we can all too often relate to. Through this lens, we begin to understand Krakauer's argument: that while most men, us included, share wild, fantastical ideals as McCandless's (or should I say Supertramp's), few have the guts to live them out; that he wasn't juvenile; he was noble.    Am I beginning to sound redundant? Yeah, that is one thing. With only one real point being proven throughout these 203 pages, Krakauer's message may as well be burned into the reader's forebrain not even mid-way into the book.Because, truth be told, as fascinating as this one point is, I'm not sure any of us need to have it driven in a handful of times every chapter. I mean, sure, there are so many cases that work marvellously as evidence, but by the end what with all the repetition throughout, the book feels a tad dissatisfying, owing mainly to the fact that the reader doesn't feel like they've gotten anything out of it, not when all the \\"fresh\\" substance sort of begins its decline after the fourth chapter.    And it's not only due to a lack of variety in material that this insubstantial feeling arises from Into the Wild. For a theme suggested to be as universally applicable as this, surfacing from the covers will not bring more than a whim of inspiration. Sure, the novel was argumentative, and sure, it drew on our emotions, causing us to relate, but unfortunately Krakauer seems to have decided not to take his work just one step further, not including any passages that might cause us to alter our perspectives on life. We might understand what Krakauer's trying to say, but we're not pushed to agree. Simply put, we're given the ability to peer into McCandless/Supertramp's most intimate thoughts, but it still feels...distant, irrelevant.    Though at least we can peer into those most intimate thoughts. And this is where Krakauer excels. In examining not only McCandless/Supertramp's Alaskan odyssey, but also his childhood, school, and college life, we really do wind up understanding how his head works.  It's like we've suddenly acquired an astounding amount of psychological insight and he's sitting in front of us, pouring out his thoughts, allowing us to read him like...an open book. Yeah. Into the Wild is that book. ...If you open it.    Though it is laden with much of the same horrific fascination that compels so many of us to \\"rubberneck\\" at multi-car-pileups on highways, I can't Into the Wild, really. I mean, it's great. But it's not for everyone--those who have already set their mindsthat I shouldn't even be recognising McCandless's chosen name in this review: you won't appreciate this book, if what you're seeking is a literary masterpiece. Those with borderline ADHD: you won't appreciate it at all, either. But everyone else...if you've an open mind, why not give it a try? It's something to pick p and flick through, to find some amazing excerpts but not necessarily devour cover to cover. It's absorbing to a point, but less for those who want to introduce themselves to this sort of mindset than for those who already feel some degree of understanding with McCandless/Supertramp.    But then, that category could include more people than you'd think. Because, let's face it, as Krakauer proves many times over, who hasn't at some point considered just...striding...into...the...wild?

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love both Jillian and Bob. But I decided to start off with a Jillian DVD because I tend to skip workouts when my schedule gets really busy. I was very active in my teens and 20's, now I'm nearly 40 and working 10-12 hour days, so I need energy and motivation. Also, I'd love to lose about 10-20 lbs and tone up. I thought since I can be a \\"Big Baby\\" when it comes to working out, so I needed someone like Jillian.<br />Well, after two months of working out with Jillian 2-4 times per week, I've seen results. My arms, abs, and butt seem to be shaping up nicely and I don't see those \\"muffin tops\\" poking out of the waistband of my jeans. Even my friends and co-workers are complimenting me and telling me I look like I've lost weight.<br /><br />Just want to add: 1. I DON'T weigh myself. I'd rather see results in the mirror or purchase clothes 1-2 sizes smaller. Call me strange or whatever, but I don't like to weigh myself because I'll become obsessive about it. Trust me, if you work out with Jillian on a regular basis, you WILL tone up and lose weight. 2. I did the Level 1 workout for the first few weeks. Later, I added Level 2. But I haven't yet done the Level 3 workout. I love Both Level 1 and 2 and I find this is challenging enough for me. I work up a good sweat, get my heart pumping and feel GREAT afterwards. 3. I wish the Cool Down for each level was a bit longer. My muscles still feel a bit tight afterwards, so I do my own stretches for a few minutes after the DVD is over. and 4. The Music during the workouts is a bit BLAH. Wish it had better music (like the music used on the \\"Menu\\" part) throughout because that helps motivate me.<br />Overall, a great workout DVD with workouts suitable for all fitness levels. Jillian is NO NONSENSE and she will push you! She says something like, \\"If you want a 20 minute workout, you're gonna have to earn it!\\" and she means it. But you will feel stronger and more energized after just a week or two. There are some days when I do Levels 1 AND 2 back to back because I enjoy it so much! Yes, you will need hand weights, but they can be purchased cheap online, at Academy, or Target. This DVD is the best purchase I've made in a LONG time. I will continue to purchase more \\"Biggest Loser\\" workouts and alternate them. Last week, I purchased one of Bob's DVD's, Biggest Loser Bootcamp. Thanks to Jillian and Bob, I feel and look better than I have in YEARS!

B001F0WXY0|5.0|I always find it instructing to start with the one and two stars reviews, when I try to form an opinion... Herbert's writing skills and his characters are the favorite targets of these reviewers. Many of the reviews here are based on a hidden presupposition that all readers share the reviewer's view of the world. They are not literary criticism, but rather philosophical critiques. IF one happens to agree with, or is persuaded in the process by Herbert's arguments, swayed to his weltanschauung so to speak, then the plot and the characters are VERY adequate, being intensely allegorical yet realistic, in a fractal-like relationship, in which the individual microcosm is reiterated to ever larger encompassing structures/universes. If you don't think the universe is funny, if you don't buy into poetic justice and the noble savage fairy tales, if your view of the world is realistic - as in positivistic, scientific and pragmatic - then your reaction to Dune is bound to be different and the author's literary craftsmanship (or lack thereof) will have nothing to do with it.<br />As far as his writing skill is concerned, many seem to find his omniscient, character shifting third person lacking, in that it prevents one from empathizing with one character or another. I find it brilliant and a delightful tour-de-force, with so many points of view in the same scene and each character a mirror to the others.<br />This book is not for Star Trek fans. It is not uplifting, it does not speak of the glory of Man, it is not about exploration, it does not serve any system's propaganda. On the contrary, it is anti-establishment in a broad sense and anti-democratic to the extreme... On second thought, it should be banned! :) Burn it! :)))

B002S4KMM2|3.0|I am also a avid Nip/Tuck fan....perhaps it's the writing and just a little more than crazy plots the show seems to keep up on, but I was sorry to see this season was a bit drab??  Was there another writers strike that I wasn't aware of??  Hopefully, season 7(the final season) will get it together and go out with a BANG!!  Come on....I know the show can produce better work than last seasons more than boring plots and I'd love to see it go out with it's fans still caring about the bizzare, crazy and the more than a little extreme characters. Good luck on season 7....but season 6 was quite a disappointment.  So fans and new buyers alike just know that although it is something to have for a complete collection of the series....it is definitely not as enjoyable as the other five. *** Stars out of five.....Dr..k.
1439153663|5.0|I loved this book. What a rare and rich story!<br /><br />Lavinia, a seven-year-old Irish orphaned girl (with a past so traumatic she is unable for sometime to call it to memory) is placed as an indentured servant with black slaves in the kitchen house of a plantation around 1800. They become her parents, her family; she is wholly devoted to them. But she cannot be one of them truly for she is white and her destiny will move her into other circles. One of the slaves is mostly white and yet that small amount of black heritage leaves her condemned to another life.<br /><br />But the richness of this book is its characters, most particularly the slaves of the kitchen house whose unbreakable love for each other is so heartfelt that they came alive to me in the most vivid way. The span of the novel is very large and we travel a long way with these characters to a startling end.<br /><br />THE KITCHEN HOUSE is a treasure! Buy it and read it!<br /><br />I am the author of CLAUDE & CAMILLE: A NOVEL OF CLAUDE MONET and MARRYING MOZART.

0393061310|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend who taught Honors history at the high-school level. I have been enjoying it enormously - it has helped me to put into perspective how human cultures arose and intertwined, affected by geography, climate and other factors. A challenging but comprehensible read.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary is an eye-opener to our food system.  As a result, I have started buying free-range, non-antibiotic/hormone injected poultry and grass-fed beef.  The switch was not an expensive one, as I had originally thought. Another take away from this film was the need for our government to subsidize not only corn and soy (because of big corporation lobbyists), but to also subsidize other produce grown in this country.  Its no wonder low income families flock to cheaper CORN-fed, corn-derived foods and skip the vitamin enriched pricey produce.  Pay now for good food or pay later for diabetic health care under our current system OR get onboard to change food policy.
B002HNAAZ8|4.0|Let me start off saying that I have been a fan of Danger Danger since the release of their first cd. With the exception of Dawn I have enjoyed all of their releases. I did like Dawn just not as much. My favorites have always been the first one and Screw It! Revolve is definitely a very good cd. In fact it kicks ass. It's not quite as good as the first two, but I love it. I highly recommend this disc.

B002XMGGK6|3.0|First, let me say the R rating for this film is well deserved.  Give me a few sentences to compose my thoughts and try to avoid potential spoilers this early in the review and I'll explain my reasoning behind that statement.  (I hate when reviewers give away spoilers without warning, especially when they needn't do so, so I really do try to avoid that myself.)<br /><br />I guess I'll start with a quick run-down of the trailers/opening advertisements for this disc.  First up, a trailer for the 2010 version of The Crazies.  The best part of that portion/segment, the haunting Andrews/Jules cover of the song Mad World (also used as a theme in the advertising for the Xbox 360 game [[ASIN:B001A4MTGS Gears of War (2-Disc Edition)]]).  Ok, I know, that's just my opinion, but I do love that version of the song.  Actually, with Timothy Olyphant starring in this new version of The Crazies, I might actually be interested in watching it when it's out later.<br /><br />Next up an ad for the George Clooney/Ewan McGregor film [[ASIN:B002VECMAE The Men Who Stare At Goats]].  I do want to catch that one when I get a chance.<br /><br />Michael Moore's [[ASIN:B0030Y11XS Capitalism: A Love Story]] gets the 3rd slot.  Pass on that one for me.<br /><br />And finally, well, no not the feature/main menu yet, there's an ad for the new Starz! series Spartacus: Blood and Sand.  Plenty of sex and blood ooozing from the ad for that one (but no, that's still not why I would say this film deserved the R rating.  It might be why the preview might, but it's not why the film does).<br /><br />Ok, finally we're at the main menu for the disc.  Here's where you may encounter a few spoilers for this film, but given how long it took me to get here, please don't say you weren't warned.  Again, the following thoughts and comments are highly likely to contain spoilers for the film or at least provide several clear clues as to what to expect from the film.  If you don't want to know in advance, then don't continue reading here.<br /><br />Once we're finally at the main menu we get the pleasure of hitting start to begin playing the 109 minute feature film.  It starts off friendly enough.  Daddy/Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is busy working on some electronic item while daughter is busy making bracelets and necklaces.  Mommy is off somewhere else in the house but fusses at daddy to answer the door when someone comes knocking.  Apparently no one told the stars of the film in advance that this was going to be this kind of film and that they shouldn't have answered the door.  (Apparently the family was too cheap to put a peep hole in the door, or have a dog to help protect the family, or other similar things.)  Before you know it daddy is near death while mommy is on the floor dieing in front of him and daughter is about to be severely harmed.  We're spared the actual gore for that event, as we find ourselves seeing hotshot prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) talking to a co-worker about their respective careers.<br /><br />We find out that Rice has a stellar conviction rate that he doesn't want to endanger by going to trial on a case that he could potentially lose.  Rather than blow a possible conviction he decides that he's going to plea bargain with one of Shelton's killers.  By making the deal he guarantees that one of the killers will face a death sentence with the other getting a lighter sentence for his cooperation.  Never mind that the killer that is getting the lighter sentence is the worse of the two (and is the one that actually did the killing), the justice system being what it is, Rice takes the bird in the hand and is left to tell Shelton that this is the best he can do.  Shelton is, of course, unhappy with this as he expected justice, but if he got it, well we'd have no movie, would we?<br /><br />10 years later Rice is in attendance when killer #1 (actually, he was killer #2, but who cares, right?) is having his death sentence carried out.  Killer gives a shortspeech noting that as god as his witness, he didn't do it, and then the system goes to work.  Except, well, from that point on nothing goes as Rice would expect.  The Killer has his sentence carried out, but rather than being a quiet, peaceful death, cruel and unusual punishment is the order of the day.  Someone must have tampered with the equipment, but who could have or would have done such a thing?<br /><br />Soon killer #2 (who was really killer #1) is getting a phone call tipping him off that the police are about to catch him on a third strike that would have him going to jail for a long time.  He starts running away immediately but gets another call that helps point him towards freedom.  Or so he thinks.  It's not long before we find him stretched out on a table about to meet the star of the [[ASIN:B0006SSOHC Saw]] films.  THIS WOULD BE THE PART THAT CLEARLY DESERVES THE R-RATING!<br /><br />Rice continues investigating and assumes that Shelton has taken revenge, though Shelton seems to ready to admit his guilt immediately.  Just as Rice is about to take his confession and run with it, Shelton reminds him that Rice has nothing even close to the legal standard that would be required to get a conviction.  Soon enough both men are in court with Rice asking the judge to keep Shelton in jail rather than released on bond.  Soon we're seeing a scene that reminded me of the Kirkland (Al Pacino) character's great blow-up in the film [[ASIN:B000053UIE ...And Justice For All]].<br /><br />I'll stop the summary here, but note that I could note similarities between elements of say the TV series [[ASIN:B000FKO3GW Prison Break - Season One]], along with [[ASIN:B001TODCII Taken (Single-Disc Extended Edition)]] and several other films (and books, TV shows, etc.)<br /><br />In the end I though the film was fine, but really nothing special enough to leave me sad at the thought of missing it.  I'm glad that I got to see it, but wouldn't run out to spend a bunch of my disposable income on this one.  Go with on-demand if possible so you can save a little of your movie buying budget.then the system goes to work.  Except, well, from that point on nothing goes as Rice would expect.

B002TXZSLM|5.0|I have read many of Mitch Albom´s books and find that Have a Little Faith is easy and inspiring to read. Maybe it´s the timing of my life, or maybe it´s just that each chapter lays down an inspiring thought: I like Have A Little Faith best.
B002E9HACG|4.0|My favorite EUROPE discs are The Final Countdown, Out ot This World, and Prisoners of Paradise. Since Start From The Dark I have missed the melodic EUROPE. This disc is a very good disc. It has cool songs and fantastic playing. It just doesn't sound as fun as they used to. If you want a good rockin disc then you will love this disc. If you are looking for the 80s EUROPE then you might be disappointed. This is a good cd. I just miss the party EUROPE. The 2 live tracks were cool also.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I bought this CD because I like Kenny Wayne Shepard, but I have to say that this is a great CD of old timers in the south. A great mixed CD of the blues. I highly recommend you buy this one. It comes with a DVD which I did watch first.
0756405890|5.0|Unbelievably book.  Even more incredible when you learn it's the author's debut.    I was somewhat upset to discover that I picked up an initial book of a trilogy without the rest of the trilogy around but the book is SO good I'm okay with that (kind of).    This book is simply awesome.    Truly.    In fact, the review should simply state \\"Awesome\\" and be done with it.

0316017922|3.0|Readable, if in places windy and somewhat meandering ... the reader has to be wary of Gladwell's less than purist sampling.  To put it bluntly he is unashamedly selective.  Some of his conclusions on relationships are a stretch, such as why Asians working in rice paddies make them better mathematicians.  The argument is convoluted going through Asian rice farmers being more rigorous, and working, longer hours than their European counterparts.  A pleasant read, but I'm not driven to read his other works.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food, Inc. very interesting and informative. I am sharing this with everyone I know. The response is always the same WOW !!! It has given my husband and I a lot to think about, and watch out for. My husband is now on the corn feed beef look out. I personally don't eat much beef, so I am glad for the help to promote a healthier choice. Getting the word out is what is needed. The television media has only focused on certain areas, and left out much of the background that is the reasons behind the problems we now have. Clearly the large corporations need to take more responsibility for what has happened, and is still happening. Yes we, as individuals have to make the right choices and be responsible about it. For many people, they can only trust on the food that is offered at a reasonable cost to feed their family and hope that it is healthy food. Many people don't realize just how much fillers they are getting instead of healthy food. Thanks for helping to get the word out.
B0000029AP|3.0|This is often touted as the best Aerosmith album, but it falls short of that mark by far.  If you really want their best go and pick up \\"Rocks\\" as well as \\"Get Your Wings\\".  To be fair some of the songs that I don't like seem to be popular among other fans.  I could do without Uncle Salty, Adam's Apple, Big Ten Inch Record, You See Me Crying, and even Walk This Way.  What's left is nothing short of phenomenal, but it is less than half the album.  I seem to be in the minority when it comes to this, so if you like Aerosmith you will probably really like this one.  I just can't help but feel like this one is missing something important.
0316776963|2.0|This book is really, honestly not as funny as the reviews make it sound.  It an ok read, not boring by any means but definitely not great either... i was disappointed after the bookstore helper raved about it.  just an fyi.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|Nothing in the description of this video is the critical requirement! If your Blu-Ray player is not connected to the Internet, the movie will not play! Nothing, na-dah.
B000000OQY|1.0|I must first admit that I only marginally like GNR as a band.  Even with that being the case there is really not anything to like about this.  I suppose Patience is a pretty pleasant tune, and I will throw it on every once in a long while.  However I really can't stand most of the material on here.  Mama Kin is the worst butchering of a classic I have ever heard.  Even for fans of the band, don't expect \\"Use Your Illusion\\" or \\"Appetite For Destruction.\\"  This band was not meant to release those albums ever again, they burnt out as quick as they arrived.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|This is one of those movies that I can't help but permanently dislike. It is not necessarily one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but still I was not moved by the film. It's excessively stylish to the point that the visuals don't seem very relevant except for the sole purpose of eye candy. It's not as visually wild as what you would find in Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, but unfortunately it's not as interesting either. The songs.....well, I was hoping for some original music at least. But most of the songs are nothing but pop culture references. If you've heard \\"Lady Marmalade\\" or \\"Smells like Teen Spirit,\\" then you will recognize the melodies right away. I did, and I became bored by the fact that these songs have been recycled and added in this movie. It's more like a poor excuse to avoid any musical originality. But I think the biggest problem I have with Moulin Rouge is the melodrama that surrounds the love story. I don't mind love stories in cinema; I mean, I do like Casablanca and Edward Scissorhands. But this is more of a soap opera. It's so sappy and so overdone, that I couldn't really care for both Satine & Christian. The ending was pretty powerful, though.<br /><br />I didn't hate everything about Moulin Rouge. There are some cleverly funny moments, and I did like Jim Broadbent and John Leguizamo's performances. The song \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\" is very amusing to listen to, and some of the visuals are indeed fascinating to look at. But in the end, I can't really admire the film because of what is mentioned above. It's not really special, at least to me.<br /><br />Grade: D+
B001EOOQEM|5.0|I think for some the idea of Black Sabbath without Ozzy is hard to accept.  If you give this album a chance it feels like a rebirth for Sabbath.  The previous two albums before this had been filled largely with filler.  This album was a complete re-invigoration of the band.  It does get a little weak towards the end with the throwaway track \\"Walk Away\\", but is otherwise a near flawless album.  This is essential Sabbath, along with their next with Dio, \\"Mob Rules.\\"  And while your at it don't forget to pick up the first six with Ozzy too, if for some strange reason you don't already have them.

B000KKPN5C|1.0|I bought this flash to go along with my D40x.  After struggling with poor quality photos, I took the D40 back to the shop where I bought it from, and they agreed that the camera needed servicing.  So out the camera body went to Nikon for a few weeks.  Nikon agreed the camera was defective, repaired it, and it came back working normally.  The flash then worked fine for 3 months, but it too has stopped working. Now I have to go through the hassle of shipping my flash off to Nikon for repairs again.  My camera is used primarily for taking family and baby photos, and I handle the camera very gently.  I am very, very disappointed in Nikon quality.  Either I am particularly unlucky, or Nikon makes cheap junk nowadays.
B00275EGX8|4.0|Let me say up front this is a very good film that tells a compelling story. I did not feel like I was being lectured about to politics surrounding the Iraq war; although, you do get the sense that some of the troops are disillusioned by their experiences. No, this seems to be a more personal story about Renner's character and how the intense focus and adrenaline rush he gets from his work develops into an obsession. The man ultimately looses his ability to feel anything or function normally outside the bubble of this razor's-edge existence.  And that is basically the whole point of the movie; to depict the emotional, spiritual, and psychological damage that this war and, particularly, the IED disposal team sustain under such pressure. These guys are definitely heroes but even those that get through it intact pay a heavy price.  The story is very intriguing, the acting is nothing short of stellar, and the documentary like style used to film it is quite effective in conveying the sense of dread that drives most of the movie's \\"action\\" sequences.  However, I am holding back the fifth star for the truly great war movies like Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, and the like.
1932100660|5.0|This very comprehensive study is an eye-opener for those who wish to live a longer, healthier life.  Once you discover the correct way to nourish your body, live longer and healthier lives, you will wonder why this information is not more widely taught and embrased as the real diet we should be following.  It is an outrage that Americans have been taught and encouraged to follow a diet that leads to early death and poor health.  I am now following this diet and cannot tell you how much better I feel, how much better my body functions and how all of my unhealthy cravings have vanished.  I commend anyone brave enough to read and follow the advice in this book - you will discover a much better, healthier future.
0307271862|5.0|Nineteen people are brutally slain in a tiny Swedish village. Obviously the work of a madman, police assume. And, shortly, a suspect is apprehended. But the story has wider implications which will eventually threaten the lives of a Swedish jurist and members of the perpetrator's own family.<br /><br />Henning Mankell has penned a riveting thriller which has its dark origins 150 years in the past and takes the reader on a wild ride from Sweden to the United States, from China to Zimbabwe and Mozambique. But this is not just another thriller. It's also a commentary on morality, issues of truth and the impact of China's development on the future as well as a fascinating glimpse into the Swedish judicial system.<br /><br />I wish Mankell had done more with the character Vivi Sundberg. She's just too good to waste and I hope he finds a place for her in a future novel.
B000Q9EPUG|5.0|Great book, if a little short. I got it in preparation to the new Halo Reach game.
B000RJW1Y2|3.0|I recently purchased this product due to my interest in playing Need for Speed: Shift, which by the way is a great game. So far, it has been completely plug and play compatible with my Windows 7 PC, and I haven't had any compatibility issues as of yet.     CUSTOMIZATION ABILITY 6/10    For the price of $32.99 before tax, this product isn't half as bad as I had predicted it would be.  Customization was a bit scarce as there was no software that came with the device itself, but a little tampering with windows and research into the product gave way to some light at the end of the tunnel.     In Windows 7 you can customize the device itself by going to the Devices and Printers and right clicking on the icon for the peripheral, but calibration or \\"middle-finding\\" is pretty much all there is for the wheel and pedals.  Thrustmaster's site is also bit hard to find, but what little technical support that can be found is located at [...]. You can download the calibration software from that website and it is leaps and bounds better than the Windows 7 option. Note that when entering the device model in the matrix of products, the only thing that will pop up is a manual. Use any other more expensive model and the software should pop up and should be compatible with calibrating this base model.    Default calibration of the wheel and pedals is horrible once you start a game, and advanced calibration through this software package is definitely a must to make the peripheral purchase-worthy. Almost no sensitivity was available by default for the pedals which made turning and drifting a pain at best. The wheel was customizable through the in game menu, and there weren't too many problems with that.     QUALITY 4/10    The peripheral itself feels cheap, and you pretty much pay for what you get. Since obviously at this price point force feedback and rumble/vibration are not available, the more cost effective method of using a bungee cord in order to center the wheel after turns leavesconsiderable play between left and right turning. If your aim is to play any real life simulation type of racing game, you will probably want to opt for a $100+ dollar wheel if you consider yourself a serious player. It is noteworthy to mention that turning was still accurate enough to get the job done, and the shift pedals on the wheel served there purpose fairly well.     After about 6 hours of game play, the right/up pedal shifter did break without excessive force, which was to be expected the way the pedal is designed in my opinion. Not many options are available at this price point, so I just glued the thing back on.  If you tend to tighten your grip while playing racing games like I do, you may want to take preventative measures because one of the pedal shifters will most certainly break on you at one point. Some duct tape or excess super glue at the connection point of the pedal shifter should suffice for most people.    After calibration of the pedals, nominal acceleration and braking weren't exactly a chore. There was about 5 percent of play in both the accelerator and braking pedals, and being made of completely plastic, extra care has to be taken into consideration in feathering the pedals for optimal accuracy in your speed.     The plethora of buttons found on the wheel serve their purpose without a hitch, and I found that they came in great use for switching views and using nitrous etc...    DESIGN 5/10    The wheel came in a paltry 8\\", which by any standards is pretty underwhelming. Once you get the feel of the wheel, it isn't completely detrimental to the game play experience, but you do feel a bit separated from even the most engaging of race simulations due to this. The pedals were also extremely light and with smooth thread carpeting, sliding will almost definitely be an issue. Some double sided tape or velcro of some sort may come in handy if your situation is of the like.    The clamping mechanism is fairly obtrusive in design, but does its job well.  In a matter of 10 - 12 seconds or so, you can have it clamped down and ready to go without even using any extra material to compensate for movement even on the smoothest of desk tops.      As stated earlier, pedal shifters are horribly designed and the buttons found on the wheel do their job well.      Overall, the purchase is sound at the price point, and I would actually dare to recommend it for light use. I have thus far tested it on my Wii, PS3, and PC and have yet to have any compatibility issues, which is always a plus and a concern with a wheel this cheap. The main thing is not to have your expectations too high, and to take preventative measures for the \\"wear and tear\\" of the device that becomes quickly evident even after your first night of intense race line hogging.

0439023491|4.0|I found Catching Fire entertaining and engaging, but just shy of the mark of the first book 'Hunger Games'.  I really liked this second book in the Hunger Games trilogy, but found myself a little bored through the first half of the book.  I was able to read Hunger Games and not put the book down.  I actually put Catching Fire down about halfway through and didn't pick it up again for about 3 months.  It just felt like it took a little too long for them to get to the Quarter Quell after they found out they had to go back.  And then once they got there, it went by too quickly, and it felt rushed just to get to the end.<br /><br />The Capitol is nastier. Katniss is more determined, and has quite the challenge on her hands.  I was a little annoyed with Katniss this time around though.  She comes off a little whiny in this book.  The arena this time around was just as disturbing as the first book.  The 'Games' didn't feel the same as book 1, but Katniss is trying to survive against the Capitol this time around and that gives it a different feel.  The ending was a surprise and I'm not sure I liked the 'leave you hanging' end, just because of who was there and who was missing.  I'm still just as excited for book 3 'Mockingjay' and I hope it's more engaging than book 2 and blows me away as a final in the series.<br />If you liked the first book, you'll probably enjoy this one as well, even though it doesn't quite live up to the first book.
0451205766|5.0|I am so glad that I took the time to read the book, despite seeing the film many times. The depth of characters in the book was far greater. Sonny's mistress Lucy had a more purposeful ongoing role in the book, as in the film her character was just a fling of passion. This was also the case with Michael's first wife, in the book she is pregnant at the time of her death, which is not clearly conveyed in the film. The depression which Freddo suffered following his father's shooting also provided excellent insight into the guilt that besieged him following his poor guarding of his father. There is so much more to the book I haven't even mentioned. Give yourself a treat and read the book!  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

B00338QENI|5.0|If you enjoy true medical genre, this will make your head spin. An unflinching look at the darker side of medical advancements. Shocking revelations of how men's quest for  technology is used on unsuspecting humans to further knowledge of disease treatment, it's erradication, and even for weapons of war. Just as frightening is the realization that there is little or nothing that remains sacred in today's medical circles as they continue to play God. The sacrifice of another human or their body parts for the  &#34;greater good others&#34;  remains the touchstone towards immortality and supreme control of power.

B002YIHO7I|3.0|In January, my jaw was on the floor when I turned on my local radion station and heard what was a riff of \\"Soldier of Love\\". I didn't hear any lyrics, didn't know who it was, but knew it was a song that wasn't the usual R&B garbage played. I was ecstatic to learn it was Sade, and was anxiously frantic for the release date. When 2/9 came, I braved the snow, went out and bought it. After listening, I wasn't exactly thrilled at what I heard. Too bad there aren't more songs with the same catchy hook/beat as \\"Soldier of Love\\". You're ready to get on the dancefloor and groove, until it segues into the third track \\"Mo[u]rning Bird\\". This song is very depressing, but somehow eerily beautiful. \\"BabyFather\\" is a sweet, but lame little \\"island-stylee\\" diddy, possibly dedicated to her daughter Ila (who sings in the chorus of this track) and her \\"babydaddy\\", a Jamaican music producer whose name escapes me. While the lyrics of most of the songs of this album attest to the trials and tribulations of life (\\"Long Hard Road\\"), the melancholic sop of \\"love lost\\" is typical Sade fare. Despite having said this, \\"Moon and the Stars\\", \\"In Another Time\\", and \\"Skin\\" are the most memorable. \\"Soldier of Love\\" will be a personal favorite of mine, always. Wish I had waited/previewed before buying...    3.5 stars is what I would rate it if I could.
B000S16J9M|2.0|Two-star rating is for technical quality, not the merit of this classic Frank Capra holiday film.<br /><br />IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was one of the first motion pictures to undergo computer colorization in the mid-1980s. Results of this process were then at best mediocre. No true reds (they often look brown), and an overabundance of pastels and broad-brush tinting made this one of the color-enhanced movies that stigmatized the process, perhaps for all time.<br /><br />A 2007 [[ASIN:B000VDDDVO PARAMOUNT DVD release]] offers both a b&w and a reworked colorized edition, and is recommended. If a VHS is desired, stick with a major studio version, as all budget labels dubbed their tapes at slower speeds. Anything other than SP mode gives diminished video sharpness (and sometimes tracking problems).

6304711875|5.0|I should mention that I do not watch slasher movies.  I have never seen one.  But I do watch Skeet Ulrich movies and that's how this one ended up in my DVD player (actually I watched it on my computer, I felt safer that way).  First, this movie has some extraordinary acting in it.  If you have to leave it because you can't stand gore, well you are in luck, the best acting I have ever seen done by Drew Barrymore starts off the movie in truly fine style.  Her ancestors would be proud.  Then who pops up but my favorite actor, Skeet Ulrich, as the heroine's well-mannered boyfriend.  It can't get much better than that for me.  I won't tell you where the movie goes, but I will tell you it was witty, it was fun, it was scary because it wanted to be, it had a lot of blood, some gore, but truth is I got through it fine because I think beneath everything this was a dark comedy.  Do I want to see any more slasher movies?  Probably not.  But will I watch this one again, probably yes.  After all, I like most of the cast, and some of the lines discussing horror movies actually made me laugh.
0394721772|1.0|This cookbook is set up similair to vol. I with all the guidelines, suggestions, and glossary BUT, the index is useless!  I have looked up at least 25 different recipies and none of them were on the page they were supposed to be.  (Not even close.  Completely different subjects i.e. the page listed for mushroom appitizers showed a beef stew!) Spending a leisurely hour one night I decided to hunt down the reciepies I wanted from the index by flipping thru the appropriate chapter and STILL could not find the recipies I was looking for.  I retrospect it looks like the index from Vol. I was copied into Vol II.....nothing works!  I have had the Vol II for 2 months and still have made the French bread and nothing else.  I have reverted back to Vol I because I can actually find what I need.  No matter how great Julias' recipies are if you can not find them they are useless.
B00288KNL8|3.0|We loved Corpse Bride, also Nightmare Before Christmas, so I thought this might be a similar style movie and that we would enjoy it too, however, I can't say that the experience was entirely positive.  A six year old watched with me, once movie was over, she said she didn't like it.  I asked why...she said she didn't like the \\"Mom with the Button Eyes.\\"  FYI: Maybe it's too much for a six year old.<br /><br />I think the reason I wasn't over impressed is that I really loved the book (Neil has written some books that I'm crazy about!) and I think this was a let down to the Coraline I had in my mind as I read his book.  Isn't that the way it usually goes?  If you read the book first, no movie can compare.<br /><br />If you are still determined to try this one, go ahead, because it was not what I would call a complete bust.  It's nicely done, just not living up to the book in my eyes.
B000002OPP|5.0|This two-disc 1968 recording is a classic. It has to be signature work of Hendrix' short-but-brilliant career.  First as an album and then as this CD, I've spent 40 years listening to these songs, I especially never get tired of hearing \\"1983...(I Should Turn To Be), All Along The Watchtower and Voodoo Child.\\"  The last two have been attempted and done well by such great guitarists as Stevie Ray Vaughan and Eric Clapton, but nobody - repeat nobody - does them like Jimi Hendrix.    A shame we'll never know what kind of innovative sounds this man could have produced with his guitar had he not overdosed on drugs at the age of 27.   This was one of the biggest losses ever to rock music and this CD is a testament to that.
B0017HEX76|3.0|This was a re-order.  I was trying to replace a back order that did not work out. This was for my niece who wanted it for nostalgic reasons (we love Fantasia and all our children watched it a lot as small children).

0061537934|4.0|I always love a book that makes me feel and root for a character I might otherwise never connect with. Told from the perspective of Enzo (the dog), he really made me wonder what's really going on in their furry little heads. They look at us with those adoring, worshipful eyes... and maybe in the mind behind \\"the look\\" there is more going on than we realize.    True or not, it was fun to consider for a few hours. Very enjoyable and a great escape.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Very good view for anyone interested in the industry that produces what we consume. It does seem to be a bit one-sided but still very informative. I was a vegetarian before the movie but I am even happier now that I have seen this movie.
0743297334|5.0|Ashamed to admit this is the first time I've read this small masterpiece. Though composed in 1924, it is strikingly modern. I forgot at times that this was about a time some 80 years ago. Jake is the kind of man's man hero that Hemingway would recreate over and over, one assumes a thinly disguised version of himself. I'll leave the lit-crit to others. The bullfights are the centerpiece here, in addition to the character of Lady Ashley, who exerts her powers over most of the men in the book. I kept waiting for something more dreadful to happen. The \\"lost generation\\" of men and women who went through WWI had their so-called voice in this book. I'm not sure why exactly that is said to be so, but there is a certain ennui and acceptance of bad fates here that stems from the trenches of the Great War, perhaps.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie is super informative about food safety and the American diet.  I got a lot of information out of it and have changed my eating habits because of it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone and have recommended it to many.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Based on the true story of a loyal and faithful Japanese dog, this film Americanizes the version of the 1930s events. This doesn't seem to hurt the story as much as it would generally and this is mainly because the story is in the skillful hands of Lasse Hallström.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed from the human perspective, Hallström also films part of the film from the dog's perspective, making sure that the scenes are in black and whites hues and are shot from the level the dog would see them from. The film works as a homage to the loyalty and friendship and the testament of the bond shared between the professor (played by Richard Gere) and the dog who finds him (played by a series of Akitas). Joan Allen is also quite convincing as a wife who refuses to take in a dog (in fact, Hachi spends his time \\"being part of the family\\" by living in a shed outside) and, later, as a grieving wife who stumbles upon the dog who still patiently waits for his master to return for nine years.<br /><br />The movie is done with authentic admiration and faithful devotion - the story never veers into the melodramatic; instead it receives a heartfelt and touching treatment. This means that, in the way of all good dog movies, you will laugh AND you will cry, making Hachi: A Dog's Tale a worthwhile retelling of Hachiko's story.

0792164903|5.0|To my mind this is the finest of the Burton/Depp collaborations.  All of Burton's work suggests the atmosophere of this film, but nothing else captures that essence so completely.  The re-writing of Ichabod Crane as a modern detective is great, in my opinion -- better than the original story.  But W. Irving can hardly be taken to court for that, as detectives didn't become \\"all the rage\\" until the likes of Poe, Doyle, and Hammett.<br /><br />There are two other adaptations that jump out:  one is the two little girls; it smacks of Stephen King, and I don't consider that a bad thing.  The second is that this Sleepy Hollow which Burton has envisioned is the epitome of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft.  So much so, that it was indeed by backtracking from the film that I first discovered Lovecraft.<br /><br />One more striking element I'll mention is supremely Burtonesque.  I mean that arthropodish, clickity gadgetry we see in Constable Crane's tools.  With Johnny Depp as the operator of said tools many will no doubt see the parallel with Edward Scissorhands.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that no other Burton films have precisely this unique, Early American vision of atmosphere and horror.<br /><br />The only other recent movie that comes to mind that possesses a similar quality is Van Helsing, but the latter most emphatically does not have the Burton/Lovecraft flavor, just the good gothic imagery.  The new Del Toro/Hopkins werewolf movie looks promising, but I haven't seen it yet.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I had been dying to see this movie, found a cheaper price to purchase than renting. I received the movie in only a few days, brand new in the wrapper. Definitely EVERYTHING I HOPED IT WOULD BE!!! I would absolutely do business with this vendor again!
B0029O08WA|5.0|Great cd, these some of these songs are just filled with so much pain and loss. I loved the placement in the movie.

0307454541|4.0|I saw this book EVERYWHERE when it was in hardback, and although it intrigued me, I didn't pick it up.  Once it hit paperback I did, and I'm glad I did, as I really enjoyed it.  It's a bit weighty; I saw another review that talked about how super-detailed Larsson is with his descriptions of actions the characters take and that's true.  But it kept my interest the entire way.<br /><br />At its core, this is the story of Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist who agrees to invesitgate the disappearance of a wealthy businessman's niece some 40 years ago.  Neither expects any real results.  Along the way, Blomkvist crosses paths with Lisabeth Salander, the tattooed girl of the title, who happens to be an almost savant-like investigator.  The two of them uncover some pretty bizarre things have gone on...<br /><br />If the book had kept its focus on only this thread, I would have liked it better, but the mystery was \\"solved\\" with about 120 pages left, so the focus switched back to the original case for which Blomkvist ran afoul of another Swedish magnate.  And I didn't care about that storyline so much.<br /><br />Great book all in all.  I'll definitely pick up the next one soon!

B0035G01WS|3.0|I'm a big David Sedaris fan, but I didn't love this book as much as some of the others.  When I read \\"Barrel Fever\\" and \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,\\" I found myself laughing out loud numerous times.  In this book, there were a few stories that made me laugh out loud, but mostly I smiled or chuckled.  Not a bad track record, of course, but just not as uproariously funny as others.  My favorite stories were those that chronicled his interactions with other people--the one with him fighting with the woman who sat next to him on the plane (I did laugh out loud during this one); the story of Helen, who lived in the same apartment building he and Hugh did; the horrible babysitter, Mrs. Peacock; and the final story, which chronicled his attempt to quit smoking while living in Japan.  Those new to David Sedaris, I would recommend you start with a different book so you truly appreciate his amazing sense of humor.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I wanted a good workout DVD to compliment my regimen and for the days I can't fit in a whole cardio workout.  I work out 3-4 days a week so I'm pretty fitness minded and not new to working out. I was a little skittish about ordering this one because I thought it might be a little bit basic for my level of fitness but based SOLELY on the feedback others have left I decided to give it a try.  All I can say is O M G ... it totally kicked my butt and I only did level 1 !  At the end, I was crawling on my hands and knees.  This is NOT your grannie's workout by any means ! It's for anyone who want to seriously get in shape.  Jillian Michaels is definitely no-nonsense but you can also take it down a notch and make it more basic by doing alternative movements and aerobic levels if you are just starting out.  Somehow Jillian manages to capture an all-encompassing, total butt-kicking workout for every level regardless if you have never worked out in your life or if you are at the top of your fitness game. I also really loved that the only things you need to workout to this DVD are hand weights and a floor mat (optional if you work out on carpet).  I loved it so much I bought two more in addition to this one, and I can't wait to see what Jillian's new Yoga Meltdown workout is all about too.  Definitely give her a try if you are looking for a great workout - you will NOT be disappointed !  Oh !  And I should mention the lightening-fast delivery too.  \\"Anticipated SHIPPING date\\" was March 1st but it was at my door for DELIVERY on February 26th, only 1-1/2 days after I ordered it.  I was pretty amazed it got here so soon.  All the way around, it's a straight-up bargain.
B002VWONB2|2.0|The video presentation is pretty great, I have to say. There is an unacceptable flaw that makes the only reasonable recommendation to skip purchasing this bluray: Dolby Digital 1.0 audio.    There have been several releases of classic movies from Warner Brothers, most notably westerns, that contain a dump of the audio track from previous edition DVDs. The most infuriating aspect of this laziness is that a lossless track *must* exist as the basis for the Dolby Digital lossy track! If that track already exists, why not just put it on the disc as LPCM 1.0? Laziness is the only reason I can possibly think of, as it surely isn't endearing any discerning consumers toward Warner Brothers' catalog releases.    Warner Brothers came out of the gate very strong, especially with titles from New Line cinema, but now seem to have gone quite sour. Between the extremely poor audio quality on this disc, and the low video bitrates/quality on the Fight Club special edition due to the lack of two discs, I'm avoiding Warner Brothers catalog releases unless I read many reviews that state otherwise.    I suggest everyone else avoid the same irritation by making sure there is a lossless track on any blurays you buy, or at least avoiding the dreaded Dolby Digital. If you're looking for classic films that are given a proper treatment, I recommend Criterion and Studio Canal.    I sincerely hope that WB offers a trade-in program like Sony had done for The Fifth Element. It is a crying shame that this classic film has an inferior release compared to other great films of the same era from other studios.
B002WY65VU|2.0|I saw this in a theater with a friend, we snuck in a bottle of Evan Williams and laughed most of the time but midway I noticed something horribly wrong was going on. The movie becomes a romantic comedy midway through and the zombie epidemic (completely 100% created by George Romero, this is a fact) becomes the 4th most important thing to the story. Which is fine in some intances, the Bill Murray (yeah spoiler whatever you already know about it) segment was brilliant but the rest of the movie is lame as hell.     I mean it, the end of a zombie movie must have some mayhem and GORE, there is none of that going on here. This movie could have been rated PG-13, do yourself a favor, be adventurous. Rent the original Day of The Dead from 1985 on your netflix account, check it out, notice how horrific every single minute of the movie is. Violent from beginning to end, barely a scene passes without a full view of the contents of a human torso or skull spilling and splattering on the walls. These mainstream zombie movies really lag behind, all the CGI in the world can't make them genuinely disturbing.     This is a chick flick with zombies, Woody Harrelson should have been the main character, this could have been a lot more fun if the right minds were involved. This film was pandering too much to the masses, trying to make everyone feel welcome, which of course never makes art.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|Oh Oh Oh, How could I have been so foolish as to purchase this junk.  The plot is a complete fantasy of a retarded mind.  If you like butchery, lots of blood and gore intended for humor, if you think seeing someone cut open using highly focused graphics for realism is fun, if you would like to see a ridiculous, contemptible depiction of a sensitive time in history made solely for the purpouse of entertainment and making money, then this film is degenerate enough for you. In fact, let me know and I will mail you my copy......otherwise in the dumpster it goes and good riddance.  Brad Pit, how low will you go for a dollar.
B001993Y2C|4.0|The video and audio quality is excellent, and there are lots of interesting features. An excellent buy for the hard-core BSG fan. Even the Cylon figure looks great!    My only beef is with the packaging. The outer box is fine, and it's really cool how the top lifts up to reveal each season on each side of the square. The problem is the box for each season. Each disc is in little cardboard slots, and its very difficult to get a specific disc out of there without getting fingerprints all over the disc. I'd suggest anyone who buys this set to take out the disc they are currently watching and put it in a separate jewel case, or something, to avoid having to keep going into the box.    At any rate, once you get the discs out of the box, and into you're player, it wont matter. It's an excellent set!
1400052173|5.0|Open google and type in \\"HeLa cells,\\" and a million and a half hits appear. This is because these cells are used and known universally throughout the medical world; far, far more than any other cell line. What has been much less well known is that HeLa stands for Henrietta Lacks, the woman from whom the original cells were taken. In \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,\\" Rebecca Skloot--a born storyteller--set out to tell both stories, Henrietta's and the cells'.    In 1951, Henrietta Lacks, a poor African-American woman living in Baltimore, was diagnosed with a virulent form of cervical cancer, and began receiving treatment at Johns Hopkins. During the same period, scientists had been trying to culture an \\"immortal\\" cell line: a line of cells that would survive for an extended period of time in the laboratory. All of their attempts had failed.    Without the knowledge of Henrietta or her family (a quite common situation), doctors took samples from her cervix and sent them to a lab to culture. Several days later, it became clear that they had finally found an immortal cell line--HeLa, as it was named, following the conventions of the time, multiplied rapidly and was virtually indestructible. By the time Henrietta died, eight months later, her cells were famous.    In the intervening years, HeLa cells were used for everything from the development of the polio vaccine to testing how cells survive in space. Henrietta's family, however, did not learn of the cell line until decades later, and then found it frustratingly difficult to get information from the medical world, which rarely told them anything and provided information of only the most technical kind.    The family's difficulties were exacerbated by both their scientific illiteracy and their timidity about challenging doctors. Neither is a condemnation: in a country where the reality of evolution is still being debated in some quarters, the Lackses not understanding cells is hardly shocking. Nor is it surprising that they felt unable to challenge the vastly better educated doctors at Johns Hopkins.    Nonetheless, one of the most haunting passages in the book describes a conversation between a Hopkins researcher and Henrietta's husband Day. Day believed the researcher to have said that Henrietta was still alive at Johns Hopkins and being experimented on. He asked no questions of the researcher, and issued no demands. The value of both scientific literacy and a middle-class sense of entitlement is compellingly clear.    As HeLa cells made vast contributions to medical knowledge as well as large profits for medical companies (though never for Johns Hopkins), Henrietta's family remained extremely poor, often unable to afford health insurance. Resentment--and confusion--grew within the family, and Henrietta's daughter Deborah--Skloot's lead character, who became a friend to Skloot over the ten years she spent working on the book--was driven almost to a nervous breakdown.    The complex ethics of tissue donation is discussed at length. There does not seem to be a great deal of agreement, but one thing seems clear: knowledge is more important than money. What bothered the various unwitting tissue donors whom Skloot discussed was foremost that they had never been informed.    Finally, though, the family began to learn the facts surrounding HeLa. A sympathetic Austrian researcher led Deborah and her brother to a bank of freezers containing their mother's cells. Deborah warmed a vial in her hands. \\"You're famous,\\" she whispered. \\"Just nobody knows it.\\"

B00006690G|4.0|I would argue that this album has the most complicated rap poetry from Eminem, in comparison to all his other albums.  He sticks to the subject and weaves intense rhymes with strong structure.  Encore and Relapse are less composed and more \\"spit out\\", while the \\"Eminem Show\\" feels like it has been scripted and perfected for years.  As with all Eminem albums, The Show contains some instant classics.  For some people, theres more classics on this album because he takes his talent a little more seriously and puts out some heartfelt songs like \\"Hailie's Song\\" and \\"Cleanin Out My Closet.\\"  My favorite Eminem songs are the ones where he has a lot of fun and goes a little crazy.  Since theres a little bit of a lack of that in this album, it's not my favorite, but I still go back and listen to some of my favorite songs.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: \\"Business\\", \\"Square Dance\\", \\"Say Goodbye Hollywood\\", definately \\"Without Me\\" and \\"Sing for the Moment.\\"  All these tracks are Slim flowing at his finest, with the best production the cd has to offer.  That being said, I felt like the beat aspect on this album was a little dissapointing, but it didn't fail to deliver on my favorite tracks.<br /><br />I will say that \\"The Eminem Show\\" is a great mixed bag for all types of people who like Eminem for different reasons.  \\"Superman\\" appeals to a lot of women as well as men.  \\"Soldier\\" and \\"Till I Collapse\\" are great for people who get motivation from music.  So as you can see this album is a great sampler for Eminem, because everyone can connect with it in some way.  I happened to like \\"Encore\\" and \\"Relapse\\" more, but \\"The Eminem Show\\" feels more orchestrated.

I gotta stop now, before you don't believe a word I'm saying.<br /><br />This was my number #2 bad movie of all time until I rented a wacky space drama with NO movie stars at the Red Box machine, and the previous renter even wrote \\"This is the worst movie ever\\" right on the disc, it was. Day After Tomorrow(DaT) gets knocked down to a tie with Armageddon as the third worst ever. Without really good actors here, I guarantee you that no one would ever have given Day After Tomorrow more than one star. It has ONLY special effects, 5.1 sound, and NO plot. If you call it a popcorn movie, I call it a comedy. Reviewers and fans hate giving movies bad reviews that have good actors being caught in bad movies, because they have done good or great movies. Quaid and Jake have done entertaining movies. Get a nice pillow and hopefully you will awake for the slam bang finish. Oh, wait, there isn't one.<br /><br />The number three worst ever, I'm watching it right now on tv, until something better falls on my head, Day After Tomorrow. Fun scenes of diaster in 5.1 sound, but is hard to watch when your head is shaking side to side. You ask, what is worse than DaT, The Core. Same scenario, great actors doing scenes that you couldn't dream up in a million years. In fact, you can't give any movie a \\"NO STARS\\" review at Amazon, and Day After Tomorrow deserves it too.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|Okay, this is the second copy of the movie I purchased.  Luckily, I did recieve the theatrical subtitles the second time.  First time I ordered the movie right when it came out and was dissapointed when I saw how different the subtitles had been.  One thing I noticed though, the english dub does use the correct words for the theatrical subtitles.  Unfortunately just terrible voice acting.  So, very grateful this has been corrected as far as subtitles actually being moreso what I saw in the actual theater.  I hear some people are still getting the first version.  Okay, this might not be the most honest idea but if you do get one of those, don't open it, buy the correct one from your local target, walmart ect.  then return the one you got from amazon to the store you bought the correct one from if you didn't get the right one.  Since the code on the back is the same, you shouldn't have any trouble.  I don't think that its illegal or anything per sa but may be against store rules or something.  If you think thats wrong, then dont but its just an idea.    Hopefully, amazon will send you the correct one to begin with.  The movie itself can be described like it was to me.  In 2008 two vampire movies came out.  One was the good one, and the other was Twilight.

I'm going to ask my physics professor buddy about the actual effects of explosions or A-bomb detonations in an atmosphere of no oxygen. He said, no way!<br /><br />This was my number #2 bad movie of all time until I rented a wacky space drama with NO movie stars at the Red Box machine, and the previous renter even wrote \\"This is the worst movie ever\\" right on the disc, it was. This movie entry gets knocked down to a tie with Day After Tomorrow as the third worst ever. Without really good actors here, I guarantee you that no one would ever have given Armageddon more than one star. It is ONLY star driven, and NOT a plot driven movie. If you call it a popcorn movie deluxe, better add in plenty of cocktails with that buttery treat, and a good nap before it is over. Reviewers and fans hate giving movies bad reviews that have good actors being caught in bad movies, because they have done good or great movies. Billy Bob, Willis, Buscemi, Duncan, and more stars, have made classic movies in their own right.<br /><br />The number three worst ever, I'm watching it right now, until something better falls on my head, Day After Tomorrow. Fun scenes of diaster in 5.1 sound, but ridiculously unbelieveable. You ask, what is the worst, The Core. Same scenario, great actors doing scenes that you couldn't dream up in a million years. In fact, you can't give any movie a \\"NO STARS\\" review at Amazon, and Armageddon deserves it too. The sequel to Armageddon could be called, Moon Apocalypse; One Million Nukes! AND starring Russel Crowe so someone will buy a ticket.  LOL.too. The sequel to Armageddon could be called, Moon Apocalypse; One Million Nukes! AND starring Russel Crowe so someone will buy a ticket.  LOL.

B00243FQFA|5.0|The season was generally good, Atlantis got another new commander Woolsey. He had a more of an active role than Samatha. He did a great job as a lawyer in one episode. The season started good, but could have ended better. I think the Scfi-Fi Channel cancelled the whole thing right in the middle of it and the writers had tie all the loose ends up as best as they could. The last episode could have been a 2 or 3 parter to draw everything to a close. They should have scrapped the \\"Las Vegas\\" episode. The series ended with so much fuel left in it. To me It could have run another 5 aseasons. New enemies could have arrived, the Wriath could have been wiped out, and so on. Lots of questions left unanswered: Would Ronin be happy on earth not beening able to hunt and kill the Wraith(I think not),What about the Pegasus galaxy? Will it be safe from the Wraith(I think not). I'm glad I bought all 5 seasons enjoyed them all, maybe this fall I'll watch them all over again. A Stargate Atlantis movie would be good!!
B002G1YPH0|3.0|I purchased and then returned this cooler, and I wanted to share my experience and the reasons why I sent it back.<br /><br />Like other reviewers have pointed out there are more expensive coolers on the market that do just as good of a job as this one. There is plenty of surface area for good contact with your processor and this item comes with bonding liquid to use (so you don't have to purchase an alternate product). Make sure you use the recommended process to temper the heat sink - some bonding material should be rubbed into the heat sink, and then wiped down to fill in the microcavities. Also - performance will improve over time as the material settles in once the heat sink is on the processor.<br /><br />My main issues with this cooler are 2.<br /><br />1) It is massive. Be sure your case can accommodate this cooler - in my system the fan was pressed to tight against the memory (this is a motherboard layout issue and a case layout issue). If you do not have a full tower case you are likely not going to have room for this cooler.<br /><br />2) It requires access to both sides of the motherboard for installation, which means that you are likely going to have to remove your motherboard from the case in order to install it. This is a major negative for me. Yes the cooling power is great for overclocking or high performance computing, but I do not like taking my computer completely apart for installation. You must install a backplate on the underside of the motherboard that will then attach to the heat sink. This is a very secure method but is really unnecessary if you get a good heat sink with the appropriate snaps/tugs that can secure it through the motherboard holes without having to remove it from the case. This is how most stock heat sinks work, as well as many other products on the market (artic brand as an example).<br /><br />Your mileage will vary. If you are just building your system and haven't installed the motherboard yet then this product will be very easy to install. Otherwise you're looking at a complete teardown/rebuild.<br /><br />Cooling power is good, but there are just a few considerations you'll want to remember. Certainly for the price you can't really beat it and it will work with a variety of motherboards and processor types.<br /><br />enjoy your cooler and do some good overclocking and gaming!y easy to install.

1400063515|1.0|This is a book of 366 pages which tries to communicate the following thought:  The future is unpredictable, and one big reason it's unpredictable is that unexpected events occur which are unforeseeable.  These events are called black swans.  If a good editor had edited this book, the book could have been cut to 50 pages.  An even better editor would have cut the book to 10 pages.  This book is essentially a one page magazine article for which Nassim Taleb got a book deal to expand the gist of the article to 366 pages.  The writing is unfocused, wandering, disjointed, unconnected, and of a style one might call stream-of-conscious.  This reviewer couldn't get through more than half of the book before he felt that reading the last half would be a boring, waste of time.  This book was purchased through Amazon, and the purchase demonstrates the downside of buying a book based upon media reputation but, sight unseen.
1569474680|5.0|In a nightmarish scenario, new mother Alice Fancourt goes out after her daughter's birth, leaving her two-week-old infant with her husband, David.  Returning two hours later, she swears that the baby in the crib is not her child.  Despite how terrified and hysterical she is, her husband insists that she is wrong.<br /><br />Thus begins a convoluted and complicated investigation, with two police detectives, Simon Waterhouse and Charlie Zailer, finding themselves at odds with one another over what is true and what is not; as they travel their separate paths, following leads, Alice drops hints and clues along the way, leading them into still another case a few years before--the murder of David's first wife, Laura, which resulted in David and his mother Vivienne having sole custody of David and Laura's son Felix.<br /><br />Is there a connection between what happened to Laura and what has now happened to baby Florence?  Who is the dark force behind these events, and what can Alice do to convince everyone that her child is missing?<br /><br />[[ASIN:1569474680 Little Face]], by Sophie Hannah, is an exciting, thrilling, psychological suspense novel that compels the reader to keep rapidly turning pages until the questions are answered.  Surprising twists and turns along the way had me shaking my head at each point.  But what will we finally learn about each of these characters, and what motivations are driving them?<br /><br />If I could, I would give this book 5+ stars.  I am not likely to ever forget this tale.

0743298020|2.0|Shades of Jane Eyre and any number of imitators: Shy, bookish young girl goes to isolated manor in the English countryside and discovers secrets.   This has been done before, many times and to much better effect -- by the likes of the Bronte sisters, Daphne du Maurier, and by many lesser writers like Victoria Holt.   I'm not saying that the genre isn't still viable, but it requires a sure hand on the part of the author -- decent prose and at least some degree of originality -- neither one of which this collection of cliches possesses.
B002VPEAOE|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />98 year old Grace is haunted by her memories when a movie producer contacts her to know more about the people she used to work for. As the unbidden memories flood her thoughts, the secrets she had kept for decades slowly unravel, and although you can guess some of the secrets, you are kept in the dark about what really happened.<br /><br />14 year old Grace started working at Riverton in 1914, for Lady Violet & Lord Ashbury, her mother's former employers. She meets their grandchildren, David, Hannah and Emmeline as she goes around doing her duties, and as things change with the first world war and family tragedies, she finds herself being Hannah's maid. Being a Lady's maid was what she had once dreamed of.<br /><br />The book is told in flash backs, and you can see the changes that happened in England after the first world war, the forming of unions and the change in the upstairs/downstairs attitude. The roaring twenties and the major changes those brought on were probably the most interesting part for me. I'd like to say more about the plot, but I can't without giving it away. All I can say is that this was definitely a page turner, with haunting details and memories. I'm definitely going to add Morton's other book to my TBR.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Being a fan of Aliens since 1986, I searched the internet for the best collection I could get for the money. Once I researched the Alien Quadrilogy and saw other reviews I was sold. I even purchased the NECA Alien 18\\" collector's figure to complete my collection. I watched all four movies again including the special editions and was surprised by how much information I was missing. If you are a true Alien/Aliens fan, you gotta own this title. You would not have any regrets.
B000002540|4.0|I used to own all the B.O.C. albums, but never really listened to the 'black and white' albums much, instead focusing on the 'hits' in the next bunch of albums.  What a find this has been!  And this live album captures what is great about BOC - the songs, of course, but the excellent guitar work, Eric's theatrics and the completeness of the band - every one taking turns doing something memorable.  If you like BOC, listen to it.  You will not be disappointed.
B0009MAP90|5.0|Do NOT be put off this album by those who suggest that Bob Dylan's debut is anything less than a folk masterpiece, and an essential part of his vast and varied canon. This is a remarkable album, sung and played with joyous abandon and total confidence, exuding a folk wisdom well beyond his tender years. Voice, guitar, and harmonica blend to virtual perfection. The song choices display a maturity and discretion that is surprising from a man barely out of his teens.     Now, don't misunderstand me here: I love urban folk revival artists and their topical songs and the sounds of the Greenwich Village era (even though I smiled and chuckled knowingly as it was so aptly skewered in the indie flick \\"Like a Might Wind\\" a few years ago for its overly earnest moralism, pretentiousness, and sanctimoniousness). But most of those records and artists sound dated. This is not necessarily a bad thing; I love old music, and dated does not offend me. But compare Dylan's debut with other folk artists of the era (Tom Paxton, Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul, & Mary, etc.) and you will be amazed at the freshness of the sound, nearly a half-century later. The only other artist from that era that strikes my ears the same might be Dave Van Ronk.     Much has been made of the fact that the album only includes two original songs, but considering how quickly dated his original, topical songs from the next couple of albums would become, you wonder if perhaps the older country blues and rural Southern sounds of the non-originals actually contribute a timeless quality to this album, allowing it to sound fresh to our ears today in a way that is impossible with much of the original material that would follow on The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan and The Times They Are a-Changin', as good as that material was.    As for those who point out that Dylan had already \\"moved on\\" when the album came out a few months after it was recorded, thereby implying a certain dismissive tone to the whole affair, and to those who point out that Dylan expressed reservations or disappointment with the album... hey, Dylan has spent his entire career \\"moving on,\\" and we would listen to none of his work if constancy were to be the defining value. And the man who later put out the often wretchedly abysmal \\"Self-Portrait\\" album, and who left \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" and \\"Foot of Pride\\" off of the otherwise ho-hum \\"Infidels\\" album, should not always get the final word in evaluating his own work! Great artists are often difficult and perverse (Neil Young, for example).    Give this one its rightful due: a strong, impressive, consistently interesting and vigorous opening shot from the most important musical artist of the second half of the 20th century.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|It's difficult to gauge how each season of 'Lost' compares to other seasons in this landmark  series simply because revisiting past years does not offer the same initial excitement it once did upon first viewing.  To elaborate, the enjoyment of each season of 'Lost' hinges on the intriguing mysteries of the island and its inhabitants being slowly and artfully revealed piece by piece through a nuanced and creative storytelling.  Subsequently, once the mystery is revealed to us, it is difficult to review past episodes and attempt to judge it on its artistic merits simply because it no longer holds the same tight spell of suspense over us as it once did when we did not know what to expect.  Thus, an audience must usually rely not on a reviewing of the episodes but a personal recall of the initial impressions the episodes made to even attempt a judgment of each season.<br /><br />But putting that wordy preamble aside, how does 'Season 5' stack up with the 'Lost' library?  From a storytelling continuity standpoint, the series continues to deliver high-adrenaline arcs that will keep audiences on their toes.  Although Season 1 and 2 can still be considered as having a special place in the 'Lost' library simply because they pioneered so many of the initial suspense and mysteries that we now take for granted as questions answered [What is the Dharma Initiative?  Who are the Others?  Is there a world outside of the island, or is it purgatory?] one still must admit that the storytelling, if not Season 1 then definitely Season 2, had some lulls.  Season 3 and 4, while perhaps not raising mysteries as significant as the origins of the Dharma Initiative or the temporal existence of the island, still does a consistent and pleasant job of presenting new mysteries to the island [Who is Jacob?  What is the island's purpose?  What is Locke and Jack's destiny?]  Also of note, after the creators of the series announced in the middle of Season 3 that the series will definitely end after six seasons, there has been no lulls in storytelling.  The series has moved in a frenetic pace ever since, and the audience never feels as if the writers are stalling or attempting to stretch out a thin storyline for the same of a standard 22-episode television format.  The story is being told as the writers mean to tell it, with no artistic failing or studio pressure to deform an otherwise great vision.  It's television magic that we are experiencing.<br /><br />From a character standpoint, the series has definitely gone down a clip through no fault of its own.  One of the most arresting aspects of the series, the character flashbacks that help flesh out present events by informing the audience of a character's past, are gone.  However, their absence are a necessity simply because there are no more backstories to tell-- we know the characters, and now the story that must be resolved is their relationship to the island.<br /><br />However, for all of us who enjoyed immensely this dual-layered approach to storytelling, thankfully the creators have found a clever way to keep us moving through time.  Two storylines are occurring simultaneously in two distinct time periods, one in the present day and one during the height of the 1977 Dharma Initiative, and they both have consequences and results on one another.  As a result, the storytelling in 'Lost' still has a dual-layer of complexity, sine each storyline from different eras continue to remain relevant to each other.<br /><br />Sorry to wrap this short, but I'm sleepy.  Great season, crucial to any 'Lost' fan, and not disappointing in the least bit.  Prepare for fourteen hours of television viewing!ons, there has been no lulls in storytelling.

I.E.    dumdumdudmdudmdudmdum- im opening the refrigerator  dududmdudmdudmdudmdum- im drinking a drink    I suppose i ask for to much, but can someone please explain this movie to me, in plainspeak and less than 5 paragraphs?
B00003CXCT|5.0|10 year old grandson received this collection to augment his Storm Trooper helmet.  A week in sick bay provided the perfect excuse to view them all.

The Storm Trooper Clones are cool and fun, but the 30 year old classics still hit the spot.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|This movie is bound to raise some ire and all for the wrong reasons. The controversy surrounding Polanski will dominate the argument. I feel that is incredibly unfair to every one else who has worked on this movie. So I am going to separate the art from the artist.    In what has to be one of the best casting decisions, Pierce Brosnan plays Adam Lang the former Prime Minister of UK. Embroiled in a controversy regarding the rendition program, he has sought refuge in America. Ewan McGregor (he is never given a name) is hired as a ghost writer after the original one dies in a mysterious accident.     Your average thriller would start out with the base setup and build on the tension leading upto the finale. But in Ghost Writer the tension is always palpable. Even in the most mundane of scenes you are never allowed to settle. The remarkable background score by Alexandre Desplat and the camera work of Pawel Edelman which paints predominantly in varying shades of bleakness play a huge part in achieving that.    Pierce Brosnan is brilliant as a conflicted man who had to make difficult decisions in demanding situations. The movie very wisely chooses not take a stance on where it stands on those decisions. Olivia Williams as Ruth Lang produces an impressive multi-faceted performance in a meaty role - the kind rare in Hollywood these days.    So if you are open to separating the art from the artist, definitely watch this movie.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|It's true!  If you don't like this movie because you think it is not faithful to Doyle's work, then perhaps you should take another look.  NO, it is not like earlier adaptations, but it MAY BE MORE FAITHFUL to the original concept.<br /><br />As far as MOVIE EXPERIENCES go - this was one of my best!  Setting aside all the reservations and preconceptions about who Sherlock Holmes should be, this movie was just plain fun.  It was one of those movies with a little of everything - Mystery, Action, Drama, and some really great Humor!  From the trailer, I was under the impression that this movie would take place at the beginning of Holmes and Watson's partnership, when in fact it was all about them going their seperate ways (which I think worked extremely well and allowed us to see a more fragile side of the brilliant and formidable Holmes).<br /><br />In my opinion, the casting was spot on.  Law and Downey's characters had a great love/hate relationship allowing for some really funny moments, but also revealing their deep respect for each other.  I also really liked Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade.<br /><br />AND THE SOUNDTRACK?!?!?!?!  HELLO!!!  One of the most enjoyable scores I've heard in years.  Varied and lively, full of folk rhythms and unusual instruments.  HANS ZIMMER as his best!!!  Go check out the soundtrack to see what I mean!

1401323820|5.0|I'm a big fan of the TV show from day one.  I hadn't even known at the time that they were planning on putting out books by 'Richard Castle' based on his time spent and research with the 12th Precinct.  I'm glad I decided to check it out.    From the peer blurbs on the front cover and inside jacket, to the press photo of 'Richard Castle' on the back, to the dedication in the very beginning, the novel feels very authentic.  As if Richard Castle on TV were a real author and used his adventures in his fictional TV life to put pen to paper and write a book based on those experiences.    If you're a fan of the TV show, you'll feel right at home reading this.  It has all the elements that make the show fun.  'Castle' wrote himself into the book, under the guise of Jameson Rook, a pulitzer prize winning journalist who's doing research for a series of articles he wants to write.  Nikki heat is detective Beckett, and even her two detectives are in the book.  In a way, it reads very much like the television show which is fine by me.  All the elements are there.  The police work, the begrudged Heat/Beckett crush on Rook/Castle, the interplay at the precinct, the ride along, crimes, suspects, interrogations in the observation room.     I have no idea who actually wrote this, but even if it weren't based on the 'research' of Rick Castle, it would still be a fun mystery/whodunnit.  My guess is that it's one of the TV show's writers, but I could be wrong.  In any event, there's a solid little mystery here as well as some genuine laugh out loud moments between Rook and the Detectives he's become latched on to.      Lots of fun!

0553381695|5.0|I didn't care too much for some of the new major characters. I also didn't care too much for the direction this book took. But don't get me wrong, it's still the second-best book (second only to 'A Game of Thrones') I've read. My complaint is only because I wanted to stay in Winterfell, and I don't think I've gotten over the fact that Eddard is dead.    Like the first book, I actually couldn't wait for the next chapter when reading this book. No other fiction book, with the exception of 'A Game of Thrones' has ever stirred my emotions like this one.     Like the first book, the story is told from the perspectives of several different characters (some of them new). Each of those characters has their own life and story. While this is a book about battles for a throne, it doesn't waste time with endless details about fighting. Instead, we read more about their personal lives; the good and the bad in all of them.     Very rarely do I ever sympathize with the 'bad guys' in books or movies. However, in this series, it's often hard to point out who the 'good' and 'bad' people are. Tyrion is definitely one of my favorite characters, and I'm pretty sure he's one of the 'bad' guys. I guess we can say they are all gray, though some are better than others. This is what I like about this series so much. It's catered to adults who understand the reality of things. Yeah, it can be depressing at times, but it's better than the cliché-ridden, good guy versus bad guy stories.    Another thing I like about this series (though I am sometimes annoyed by this...though I prefer it that way) is that the author doesn't seem to care about how the readers would want the series to go. The storylines are not predictable, and the 'good guys' don't always win. This series is about the kingdom, and not about any individuals. Like history, the story doesn't always turn out the way we want it to, though it's still VERY interesting.    I would NOT recommend this series to casual readers since it's so long and requires a lot of attention and commitment. Because of that and quite a bit of graphic content (in many different forms), I would definitely NOT recommend it for kids or teens.
B003102JDM|5.0|This is the Coens' masterpiece. Obtuse, perplexing, exceedingly clever and insightful. From the perfect synchrony between the physics concepts Gopnik teaches and the form and content of the film, to the great characters and perfect acting, A Serious Man doesn't miss a beat. It follows a physics professor whose life is falling to pieces. Ironically, his decline mirrors the very concepts he teaches to his students, but he can't quite grasp the application to the real world. He focuses on the math, but doesn't understand that the principles apply to life as well. As such, he refuses to SEE the reality of his situation, the causal factors that are leading to his crises, and that his lack of objectivity in this regard is the very thing that keeps things from getting better.<br /><br />At the end of the film there is a scene where Gopnik makes a choice and the consequences are immediate, as if the phone call he receives was a collapse of quantum probabilities determined by his own state as the quantum \\"observer\\" and the choice he just made. He constantly refuses gnosis (\\"I don't want Santana *Abraxas*!\\"), sees only the chaos, and is thus at its mercy. He is slave to the law of accident, it the terms of Mouravieff's [[ASIN:1872292100 Gnosis]]. The dynamic is explained in depth in Laura Knight-Jadczyk's second [[ASIN:1897244274 Wave book]]. When everything he thought was true turned out to be a lie, then what? He did nothing, and his life was the direct result. The film is really a meditation on the truth of the Rashi quote which adorns the opening titles: \\"Accept with simplicity everything that happens to you.\\"
B002XMGGK6|4.0|Jamie Foxx turns in a solid performance in the otherwise by the numbers \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\". A high quality genre piece, with solid casting in many smaller roles, the film has a highly derivative feel despite an effort to provide a serious twist to story expectations. It is in many ways a standard revenge story, that might in some ways be phrased as the answer to the question: \\"What if Richard Kimble, in \\"The Fugitive\\", instead of running from his conviction had embraced it, and was also uniquely qualified to mete out revenge to everyone who had allowed the real killer to go free?\\"<br /><br />The film opens with a husband, wife and daughter being brutally knifed and beaten by home invaders. The husband survives, but the wife and daughter perish. Later, when the killers have been identified and brought to trial, Jamie Foxx, as a polished and ambitious assistant district attorney preoccupied with working the system to get a high conviction rate, even if justice is short changed, makes a deal that convicts one of the two men, who only watched the murders being committed, while giving a light sentence to the man who did the actual crime in exchange for his testimony that guarantees Foxx a conviction of the accomplice. The husband/survivor swears revenge on the corrupt system, but how this is accomplished builds some interesting twists into the formula to keep the audience's attention.<br /><br />The husband sets a long term plan to track down and brutally murder the killers of his family. Ten years after the original crime, the convicted accomplice, who only watched the murders and is set to be executed by lethal injection, dies a horrible death when the husband somehow manages to rig the lethal \\"cocktail\\" given at the execution to create as much pain and agony as possible. The real killer, who received a lighter plea bargain sentence and has been released already, is lured to a remote warehouse and then brutally murdered, bit by bloody bit, in a way that calls to mind the gore and sadism of the \\"Saw\\" films. The husband then allows himself to be captured, convicted and imprisoned himself for that crime, and then begins to orchestrate a campaign of remote control death that baffles the police and the district attorney.<br /><br />The tension built up by the puzzle of how the victim turned avenger then manages to kill the attorneys and officials originally involved in the failed prosecution of the killers of his wife and daughter, ten years before, is largely wasted in a gimmicky wrap up that is mostly about making sure the killer gets his comeuppance by the hour and forty-five minute mark of the film.<br /><br />Foxx is a great reason to watch the film.

B001FB55HQ|2.0|Well this is a crying shame. I love Terminator and T2. McG wanted James Cameron's blessing on this film and , proving he is no dummy, Cameron did not give it to him. Smart man. McG came from music videos and it shows. In his own furiously fast fashion this is a love letter to Cameron. There are iconic lines, a weird looking Arnie, Linda Hamilton's voice (sorta), and the actors do what they can with the material; calling it cheesy dialog is an insult to cheese.    This isn't Christian Bale's movie, it's Sam Worthington's and he does a fabulous job. Bale is his usual intense self playing a soldier trying to survive and be a leader and a husband without losing his mind.   The directing is terrible. Worse than terrible. This isn't \\"Batman and Robin\\" or anything, but if you saw the trailer/preview, you saw the movie. And that is a tragedy. Cameron created a series with meat; McG serves you a packaged salad without  dressing and expects you to be happy about it.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|After finding out this DVD was on sale after Michael Pollan was on Oprah, I just had to get it! It arrived in brand new, perfect condition. I had already seen the movie, but I felt I had to have my own copy of it in order to share it with friends and family who have not seen it yet. Americans need to know where their food is coming from and they need to make conscious decisions everytime they shop because each item purchased IS a vote. A must-see for all, especially those people who eat tons of meat and processed foods without a care. Of course, I understand that their are people in this world who can't exactly afford food other than this (I was one of them), but if you can afford to make smart decisions when purchasing food, please try your best to do so. This movie will compel you to do so.
0375703764|3.0|Do you like the funhouse at a carnival?  Do you have trouble remembering that it isn't real?  Are you genuinely surprised when a stuffed dummy pops up out of nowhere when you are actually expecting it? Congratulations, you will enjoy House of Leaves.     If these things are a bit too childish or maybe just a little too cliche, House of Leaves will leave you rolling your eyes and a bit ashamed of yourself for thinking you've found something novel and brilliant.  This becomes even more evident when you listen to others extolling its avant-garde format as brilliance or evidence of some superior intelligence at work.   In short, the book is self-indulgent tripe wrapped in the shiny paper of brilliant formatting.     After about 400 pages of coming up short on story, short on character development, mind-numbingly bored with obvious tricks of form, (not to mention the sheer waste of space and paper) then finally coming up on another one of those buried 'gotcha's...I became painfully aware that I had duped myself into thinking that there was a pony buried in there somewhere.   In short, not embarrassed to say I took the back door out of the funhouse in search of a decent book. If someone tells me that they enjoyed it, I pat them on their head and smile indulgently.  It's like watching a child discovering that yellow and blue make green.

B0026P3G12|5.0|When she came on stage, and said: I am 47, and that is only one side of me: I laughed out loud. I didn't think she was going to be that good. I bought her CD (from Amazon) and listen to it regularly. I watched the reaction of the audiance and the panel of judges (especially Simon) before and after she sang. What a surprise, she is a really good singer. I thought is was so funny when after she sang she started to walk off the stage without talking to the panel. She should have won (imagine a dancing group winning).
B000VDUWMC|1.0|Do NOT get the Kindle version of this book. Get the \\"dead tree\\" version. There are numerous illustrations that do not come through properly on the ebook.

B002X9W50E|5.0|There is something about attending a concert that makes one feel connected to the artist in ways that differ from a studio album. Mainly, if you are lucky, the artist speaks to the audience, speaks to the listener, shares a bit of themselves in the real word by the act of speaking. Now this might seem off the wall to be an important part of this review, but the music itself is spectacular, well mixed, fresh play of old favorites; simply wonderful sound. Bu,t when Bowie says, you better stick around, I just might play all night long,.....it's worth it. Because he does. David Bowie is a master musician and songwriter to have been so cutting edge so many years ago, and to be going and blowing so strong, I say hell ya, I'll give you my money.

B000B5XZLU|5.0|The only reason I give this 5 stars is for one...this is like their 5th or more album and it competes with any of the past ones.  For me, this cd I do not like all of the songs, but the songs that I do like, I like more than other songs I like of theirs on other albums.      I like Feel Like It Should, Dynamite, Seven Days In Sunny June, Time Won't Wait, Black Devil Car and I love Starchild.  Starchild is one of my favorite Jam songs of all time.  Up there with Love Foolosophy, Little L....    I also think this is easily better than Return of the Space Cowboy and Synkronized.    It seems if you are an old school Jamiroquai lover and more into simple beats and less confusion, you may not like this, but if you just like Jamiroquai and what they do in today's world, then you will like it.
1594488843|5.0|I just finished reading \\"Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\\" and found it quite extraordinary.  It  is interesting, well-written, concise, and well documented.  It is the first serious book on management that I've been able to finish.  (By contrast, I am rarely able to finish the books by more traditional management gurus.) Although focused on the business world, Pink's work has important implications for managing in government organizations as well.  Congratulations to Daniel Pink for helping us rethink and hopefully reshape our organizations!
B000INAXGU|5.0|A lot of Greatest Hits cds either do not have the greatest songs on them in my opinion or the band is not good enough to have a Greatest Hits cd.      This cd is a great greatest hits cd.  Granted you have to like Jamiroquai, but if you do, you should really like this cd.    There are some songs missing in my opinion, like You Give Me Something and Starchild, but they got almost every choice right on this.    This goes in order to of their releases I think, so you can see how they progress through time or how things change and how their budget changes too.  I like the old, I like the new.
B001NESPHC|3.0|Melody's story is truly inspiring and we should all be grateful her misfortune led to her discovering her gift, but, I, as probably and over-cheery American just found this CD a little bit too much of a downer for me to enjoy or listen to repeatedly. She does have a beautiful voice though and her jazz stylings are superb.
0385737424|5.0|Maniac Magee is my all-time favorite book.  Now...this new book by Rebecca Stead will likely surpass Jerry Spinelli's masterpiece - for me.  I have never read a book that manages to unfold every scene, every chapter, every paragraph, every sentence, every word in a way that connects to the plot.  It is perfect storytelling.  A strong female character with an unforgettable voice (Miranda!).  A bunch of supporting characters who add to the story and all that happens to Miranda!  While adults may love this book more than 4th to 6th grader readers - more skilled younger readers (Grades 4 - 9) will love it too.  Perfection!  I just hope that whoever buys the rights to the movie will not butcher it like they did to Maniac Magee.  Reading the book was an outstanding experience!  So so great!
B001KR0BDI|3.0|this was a good book. entertaining. quick. and very unique. BUT... i think that the dialouge between the characters was poorly written. at parts it you would ask yourself /who says that/ the ending was a bit rushes. but the novel is full of good characters. a magnetic heroin. and a fresh new idea that doesnt leave your mind after u hve finished it.
1400052173|5.0|Excellent. A must read! Everything you wanted to know about the most important cell line in human history, HeLa, and so much more. Rebecca Skloot's first book is simply captivating. Her narrative is excellent and her style engaging. She achieved something that one rarely finds in a book of this kind: a solid and very accurate exposition of the science intimately intertwined with the human element. Or better yet, a heartbreaking human story framed by amazing science. Bravo.
1932100660|4.0|This book was everything I was hoping it would be; very thorough, educational, comprehensive, and credible information. It is a true eye-opener for those of us who are still thinking that the FDA and such organizations are really looking out for our best interest. If you seek ultimate health for you and your family, this book needs to be on your shelf. If you have health challenges that you wonder why you can't find the source of, read this book. It is very well written, no scientific mumbo-jumbo. Tons of information that everyone who eats in America needs to know.

1400079276|3.0|This is the second book by Murakami that I have read (Hard-Boiled being the first). As a reviewer, I fall to the negative. Irrespective of the imaginativeness of the plot, or the themes involved, I found the writing, simply, to be terribly clunky, and at times quite banal. The shifts to philosophical conversation feel forced, stylistically lacking any elegance (or sophistication), and disjointedly inserted into the flow of the story. The sex is so point-blank as to be humorous -- and not in a good way. And at times the language and delivery is flat bad (pg 326 in the hardback edition for example). Though in honesty, I wonder how much this is due to the translation: and frequently the writing feels like it was clumsily translated, with not enough attention paid to the style and flow of the words, sentences and paragraphs.     As a reader, I have yet to see what distinguishes Murakami from popular fiction: both novels seemed to lack organic unity. Imaginative, yes. But on the level of the writing, is it really any better than generic fantasy? (Or am I being denied that artistry by the translations?) Unable to answer that question, I offer this simple summation: I was unimpressed (having forced my way through the last quarter), though reserving final considerations of Murakami's work until a later date (possibly until after a full translation of Wind-up Bird becomes available).
B002VKE1K2|4.0|Movies such as Paranormal Activity come down to a horror fan's tastes. A gore and slasher--type horror fan may not find this movie quite as enjoyable, because it's subtleness, using bits and pieces of brief, unsettling moments to \\"get under your skin.\\". Personally, I think movies in the vain of Saw, Hostel, Day of the Dawn, etc. have become too repetitive and predictable. They give you so many scares throughout that nothing in the film has any impact later on, say in the film's final moments. Everything that is scary is usually out in plain view, and these films are more visual in their attempts to frighten. This is where film such as The Blair Witch Project, The Haunting, The Exorcist and  Paranormal Activity differ. They excel in taking the \\"less is more\\" approach; they give you brief moments which disturb you, but these foreshadow an even more disturbing end. As we see strange occurrences during the wee hours of the night--ambiguous noises, a slight moving of the door, perhaps a strange voice--there is an unseen force working against the couple. The unsettling atmosphere in Paranormal Activity comes from not only seeing strange occurrences during the night, but the anticipation and suspense of waiting for something terrifying to happen. As you learn about Katie's past, you sense that a demonic experience is imminent. Some viewers may scoff at the daytime scenes as being \\"boring\\" or \\"uneventful\\", but these moments of relative calm are sharply contrasted with the eeriness of each succeeding night, giving the night scenes an even more foreboding quality.     Many people compare Paranormal Activity to The Blair Witch Project in its indie, amateur, home-style video \\"real life\\" documentary ways, but I think that Blair Witch was vastly creepier, and had more logic to its plot. One of the things that irked me was Micah's way of being so antagonistic towards the entity, and his behavior  was (for lack of better word) moronic at times. Clearly this guy has no sense, and seems to be doing everything in his power to invite demonic forces inside the home, such as yelling at it, and then later buying a Ouija board. The fact that Katie stays with this guy, despite his obvious recklessness and immaturity, is puzzling. One scene that seemed unnecessary added in was the second visit by the psychic. He can't stay, he tells the couple, because the presence doesn't want him there, and is gone in a few seconds. Despite a few flaws here, I still felt it was a solid film.     Horror films should not be solely on what scares viewers during the film, but how it affects them afterwards. This is one of those films that might make you think twice when you hear something during the night in an otherwise silent house. It is the same fear that you might have had to go into the water after watching Jaws, or into the woods after watching The Blair Witch Project.     The hype given to this film before, during and after its release probably didn't help it, and Paranormal Activity would have been better to fly under the radar, mainly because it doesn't appeal to most. Still, for what it's worth, I praise a horror movie that can create spooks with what you don't see rather than what you do.
B000MRA5EM|5.0|I purchased this for my students (4-7yr olds) and they love it. It is appropriate for their age and they are amazed by the animals. The narration is wonderful and explains to the viewer what you are seeing. They cover symbiotic relationships, different saltwater habitats, animal diets, and predator/prey. Not only do the kids love it...I do too!!
B0000024W3|5.0|Whatever the reason for its release, Self Portrait is the sister to the basement tapes (the real ones, not Robbie's lame album), John Wesley Harding, Nashville Skyline, and New Morning. I only wish that I hadn't allowed the negative reviews from the so-called experts to scare me away from it for so long.  By the way, Dylan (the album) ain't half bad either.
1416550550|5.0|\\"The Forgotten Garden\\" deftly weaves an intricate tale from the perspective of three generations as a family secret is created and later unravels.  I won't rewrite the plot, as so many other reviewers have most competently already done, but I wanted to say how much I loved this story and give it the 5 stars it deserves.  It took me about 80 pages to be completely hooked, but after the background has been laid and the real story begins and you attempt to guess the solution of this novel's mystery among the twists and turns it brings, you won't be able to put the book down.  I devoured this story in 5 days.  It is a long book, but the many pages completely flesh out the story and leave no string untied by the end.  I loved this book and was completely satisfied!
B000002KKK|5.0|All of ZZ Top's recordings are great, but this one was special. These three guys from Texas were in the zone when they created what I would call their masterpiece. This was the last of their blues driven rock and I can still put this one on today and play it over and over again. There are not many recordings out there I can say that about. If you are new to ZZ Top, start with this one first and don't stop until you have them all!!!
B001BPJJ82|5.0|I'm alway on the run, always busy. In truth, it's difficult for me to last an entire movie when I have \\"down time.\\"  This movie is so beautiful, its color so saturates the screen and its acting and costuming is so breathtaking, I couldn't stop watching.  I did,however, pause it now and again to savor the experience and to read up on it online.  I'm 50+ years old; the child actress in this film is by far the best I've ever witnessed. The film is rich, satisfying, exhausting, emotional. For this film alone, you must buy a Blu-ray player if you can.

068987474X|5.0|Love this book.  It's not for everyone, but if you are questioning why a man treats you the way he does, says nice things and then doesn't follow through, it's worth reading.  I personally tend to focus more on what a man says than what he does, and this book taught me that his actions are much more important that what he says.  This book changed my life and my relationship.

B000BB1MI2|2.0|I have to offer a counterpoint to all of the reviews praising this movie for being so faithful to the book.<br /><br />While many things about the movie were based more on the book than the first Willy Wonka movie, this new movie added a ridiculous plot tangent where Wonka is a dentist's son desperate to seek his father's approval. This sub-plot (which has *nothing* to do with the original book) featured some of the worst acting I've *ever* seen from Depp -- which shocked me, as I consider Depp the best actor of his generation. Still, everyone has to have a miss or two. Depp went for creepy, and got it, but far too many of his scenes (including all of these \\"dentist flashbacks\\") feel like he's forcing it. I was watching a man act, not watching a character.<br /><br />As for the rest of the movie... it was pleasantly dark, but lacked the sense of wonder that the first movie brought to life so well. Gene Wilder may have been too nice and accessible as Wonka for some, but his factory felt like an otherworldly place of mystery and surrealism. Depp's factory feels fake and lifeless, and ultimately makes it very difficult to lose yourself in this new, strange place. And that, my friends, is the only way by which a film like this can be judged, hence my low rating.
0375842209|5.0|This book has already been beautifully reviewed here on Amazon so I will only add a few words to what has been said. My book club is currently reading 'The Book Thief' and after initially being irritated by the writing style I became inthralled with the story. So many oustanding parts, the snowman in the basement, Rudy and his love of Jessie Owens, the stories and illustrations by Max and the especially moving part for me near the end when Liesel finds Max. Can't wait for my Book Club meeting!

B000BBOUU4|1.0|This is a Tim Burton movie - dark, creepy, drippy, and cold. When it starts, you think you're watching Batman - loud elaborate sound track, cold villainous set design. Really, you expect a shot of the Penguin or Riddler to pop in anytime.    The storyline is VERY much like the 1971 movie . . . except different. Because you know the plot line so well, much of the movie is very predictable. I guess Burton really tried making it interesting, but it comes across as contrived, dark, and, well, Burtonesque.     Burton has a fixation on dark fathers and oppressed sons. There's this odd backstory about Wonka and his overbearing father, making him wear some kind of torture device orthodontics that look like something Scissorhand would wear. Very Hellraiser-like.    Wonka. Really bad. Depp is lost here. He mixes bits and pieces of other characters into his roles, and it shows here. You first see him after this bizarre candyland introduction that bursts into flames, and all the cute dolls violently melt before your eyes. (Very disturbing for children to watch. Which is why Burton does it, of course.) He acts like Michael Jackson, and you wonder if that's going to be the essence of his role.    Nope. Depp's Wonka can't ever figure out who he is: malicious, misopedic, moody, petulant, weird. And more. He really makes no sense, and this is Burton's fault because Depp does basically whatever Burton wants.    Remember Scissorhand's odd father/son complex? Well, its back, only this time with Christopher Lee as the father-God figure, and Depp's Wonka as the harmed child. Burton has some very long-standing, deep-seated emotional issues here, and I guess he doesn't mind because it makes him a lot of money. (And actually, I believe its his personal interpretation of God and His woeful, misbegotten creatures. You see it a lot in his movies.)    The oompa loompas are really bad. They cloned this one Indian midget named Deep Roy - only adding to the cold, sterile nature of this movie - soyou basically have one guy multiplied into a thousand.     Yeah, this is a not good movie. Its confused, dark, and only marginally entertaining. Take a pass.
0061122416|2.0|I'm not going to say that I don't understand the positive reviews here, because I do. This book is inspiring in the same way that a sunrise is, and that is a way that's been pointed out every day since the beginning of time.    I found this book to be a culmination of all the cheesy, so-called-encouraging \\"what's-meant-to-be\\" quotes that any distant friend gives you when you're stressed out.    As a book, I found it to be average. I was able to finish it easily, but the message was dragged. The final scene was exciting and written well, but the message was too Aesop for me.    A friend recommended it to me saying that it \\"changed her life.\\" It certainly didn't change mine, and if it changes yours... I think you've been living under a rock for a while.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Food, Inc., while sometimes difficult to watch, educated me about the food industry. A few big corporations controll all the farmers.

045122499X|4.0|I have read a dozen or so Follett books. Some of them are stinkers. The best is probably Pillars of the Earth. World Without End is the sequel as you know. It takes place a couple of hundred years after the 1st book. And other than the local and distant relations, your basically dealing with a new set of characters.<br /><br />What is not new (and what Follett's readers will be glad for) is that Follett revisits the writing style of Pillars. He takes the struggle, the soap opera never ending episodes and re-uses the format to great effect here. This time he has at the core a young to middling couple. He follows their lives from childhood to old age. As time passes, he follows the progress of the town and the lives of many other characters as well. Its all very good. Each chapter has a bit of drama that keeps you engaged.<br /><br />I dont think you can go wrong here for a good old fashioned page turner.
6305754950|4.0|The town drunk - a disgraced lawman; a young punk who thinks he's \\"all that\\"; an old fart given to countrified aphorisms - and the tough-guy Duke, beloved of all the ladies and apparently unstoppable no matter what happens to him. Howard Hawks' RIO BRAVO of course - or maybe not. It's the conventional wisdom that both this film and RIO LOBO four years later are just thinly-disguised remakes by the same director of the 1959 film which has become a beloved classic. But plot was never all that central to Hawks' films, and the mere fact that John Wayne is not playing the sheriff, and Robert Mitchum as the drunk is actually the man who is supposed to be in charge ought to be enough to show that EL DORADO is aiming in a slightly different direction.<br /><br />Wayne is Cole Thornton, a gunslinger who seems to have managed to largely stay friendly with - or at least not make enemies of - the law in his career. He's come into the town of El Dorado to take a job with Bart Jason (Edward Asner), but before he can accept it his old sometime-friend Sheriff Harrah (Robert Mitchum) gives him the lowdown - that Jason is a no-good land thief and he's trying to drive the other big ranchers in the area, the MacDonalds, out by force. Thornton doesn't take the job, but as he's leaving the area he's forced to shoot a young member of the MacDonalds who fires on him, and is in turn shot by Joey MacDonald (Michele Carey). The El Dorado \\"doctor\\" can't remove the bullet, and Cole takes off, ostensibly to get fixed up.<br /><br />Which he never does, however, instead befriending a young knife-throwing kid, Mississippi (James Caan, 26 and in one of his first major roles) and having a wary conversation with Nelse McLeod (Christopher George) who it turns out is planning to take the job for Jason that Cole turned down. Cole, stung by guilt feelings over killing a MacDonald, decides to return to El Dorado when he hears that the sheriff has gone around the bend with drink, and allows the punk kid to come along, trying to teach him to shoot along the way. Back in town, he finds himself taking charge of the situation when Harrah proves essentially useless, and eventually the semi-sobered-up sheriff, the gunslinger with the bad back, the punk kid and the elderly ex-Indian fighter deputy Bull (a superb Arthur Hunnicutt) end up having to keep the captured Jason in jail, all the while fending off his men including the fast-draw McLeod.<br /><br />Of course, like most if not all of Hawks' films, EL DORADO is mostly about male camaraderie at heart, but the form that takes is a little different from the previous film, and the focus is if anything even more on the relationships, the dialogue, the fun and games than on getting to the climax of the film - which ends up feeling very anticlimactic, even perfunctory, when we do reach it. In the earlier version of this story (partially written, like this film, by the great Leigh Brackett) Wayne's John Chance is the leader from the beginning - the sheriff and the most competent man. Eight years later, with an older Duke and a paunchy Mitchum playing both the lead lawman and the Dean Martin drunkard role, it's a more level playing field. Hunnicutt's Bull is also far more competent than his analogue in the earlier film played by Walter Brennan. Interestingly enough the kid played by Caan here recites poetry; Ricky Nelson of course sang.<br /><br />So there are just as many differences as overt similarities; what they add up to is a film that is more about slightly shifting but more equal power dynamics, friendships that are a little easier-going and dialogue that is more witty than tough. The youth of the kid - and the women in the film - are deemphasized, the age and infirmities of the other main characters are a little more obvious. I suppose it ends up feeling like an \\"old man's film\\", a more relaxed and \\"fun\\" piece of work, and so it unsurprisingly lacks somewhat in narrative drive.  RIO BRAVO, and Hawks' earlier RED RIVER managed to fit the dynamics of the conversational and the confrontational together a little more smoothly, and as funny and low-key as they are at times still manage to have rousing conclusions. As beautifully put-together as this film is - and I should mention in particular Harold Rosson's gorgeous burnished autumnal cinematography - EL DORADO doesn't quite get there, but the journey is fun just the same.<br /><br />I have the earlier version of the DVD, which is no-frills except for the trailer, but the transfer is excellent and I have no complaints really.  This is one of the best late films for both director and costars Wayne and Mitchum and I'd certainly say it's a must for fans of any or all of them.f the conversational and the confrontational together a little more smoothly, and as funny and low-key as they are at times still manage to have rousing conclusions.

Her being the first person in a long time who could surprise him, Edward can slowly feel the light at the end of the tunnel. He is on his way to become a better person, whereas Vivian has got a new chance to start over again. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts give magical performances as a shrewd businessman and a lovely prostitute. I recommend this star-studded movie to anyone who's a fan of Richard Gere or Julia Roberts. You'll laugh, you might cry, you'll be touched, and you'll want to see this movie over and over again.
B002ZHKZEM|4.0|I'm a great Doctor Who fan, but would have to say that the first three specials are not actually that good. Three stand-alone episodes that might have been rejected for the normal series. Having said that, the package is redeemed by the excellent concluding two parter that wraps up the Russell T Davies era of the show magnificently. Apart from the slip of having Martha marry Mickey (where did THAT spring from? Wasn't Martha engaged?), it's a sure-footed, exciting and most importantly, fun end to this era of the series. Roll on Moffat and the return of the weeping angels I say :-)
B002VWNICC|5.0|In the 1950's Los Angeles is the seedy backdrop for this intricate noir-ish tale of police corruption and Hollywood sleaze. Three very different cops are all after the truth, each in their own style: Ed Exley, the golden boy of the police force, willing to do almost anything to get ahead, except sell out; Bud White, ready to break the rules to seek justice, but barely able to keep his raging violence under control; and Jack Vincennes, always looking for celebrity and a quick buck until his conscience drives him to join Exley and White down the one-way path to find the truth behind the dark world of L.A. crime. \\"L.A. Confidential\\" is brilliant. The screenplay and direction are second-to-none. The performances by the ensemble cast are also superb. When a movie evokes an era as well as L.A. Confidential does, people take notice. If you are a fan of crime-drama and detective stories, you won't be disappointed.

B000NHG7BG|5.0|In the 1970s, FBI Agent Joe Pistone goes undercover and infiltrates the mob in New York City. Using the name Donnie Brasco, he befriends a 'made' mafioso Benjamin 'Lefty' Ruggiero. As time goes by, Pistone begins to identify and care for his mafia friends, especially Lefty. Pistone is married and has children but he is away for weeks or months at a time eventually leading to his wife asking for a divorce. When he stops reporting to the FBI daily as is required, his superiors decide the time has come to pull the plug on the operation. \\"Donnie Brasco\\" is an extraordinary movie in many ways. The performances are note-perfect. But there's so much more to it than that. The late 70s period details are impeccably captured, the dialogue is extraordinarily raw and realistic and the moral dilemma facing Depp is achingly, agonisingly conveyed. It's a powerful movie, completely involving, that by the end you find yourself wrapped up in Pistone's predicament, asking what decisions you would make in the same circumstances. An absorbing, well made gangster movie.
0316069906|5.0|This book uses solidly researched facts, great prose, moving stories, and the occasional witty post-modern flourish to make it impossible to deny the implications of eating any animal. (What happens when you know that fish recognize each other as individuals and have distinct preferences and dislikes for other fish? What happens when you discover that even crabs seem to not only feel, but remember, pain?)     A little internet research reveals just how bad living conditions are for most dairy cows and almost all of the chickens who produce \\"free range\\" eggs. If you've decided to try to cut suffering in life as much as possible, it's also hard to shut out the fates of the unwanted male calves/older cows. And then there's the question of sustainability. (What happens when you realize that animal agriculture produces more greenhouse gases than all forms of transportation combined?)     So what if you should happen to read Jonathan Safran Foer's terrific book and wind up as a vegan? Here are a few cookbook recommendations:     anything by Robin Robertson ([[ASIN:1558322116 Vegan Planet: 400 Irresistible Recipes with Fantastic Flavors from Home and Around the World]], [[ASIN:0470085029 1,000 Vegan Recipes]], [[ASIN:B002AKPEZ4 Fresh from the Vegetarian Slow Cooker: 200 Recipes for Healthy and Hearty One-Pot Meals That Are Ready When You Are]]); Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Romero ([[ASIN:156924264X Veganomicon: The Ultimate Vegan Cookbook]], [[ASIN:1569243581 Vegan with a Vengeance : Over 150 Delicious, Cheap, Animal-Free Recipes That Rock]], [[ASIN:B002AKPEGI Vegan Brunch: Homestyle Recipes Worth Waking Up For-From Asparagus Omelets to Pumpkin Pancakes]]); and Terry Walters ([[ASIN:1402768141 Clean Food: A Seasonal Guide to Eating Close to the Source with More Than 200 Recipes for a Healthy and Sustainable You]]).     Many vegans have made it off cheese with the help of Jo Stepaniak's brilliant [[ASIN:1570671516 The Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook: Delicious Dairy-Free Cheeses and Classic \\"Uncheese\\" Dishes]](the Parmezano Sprinkles, Crock Cheez, and Gooey Grilled Cheez\\" are especially great).     Others, who initially floundered a little in figuring out nutrition or how to keep their energy levels high, have done well with the information in [[ASIN:1570671036 Becoming Vegan: The Complete Guide to Adopting a Healthy Plant-Based Diet]].     Of course it's impossible to avoid causing any harm (we still haven't figured out, for example, what to do about war and torture and world hunger!) But we do have a choice about what we put on our plates; we can eat in ways that release resources for those who don't have them, protect the planet, and reduce unnecessary suffering for those creatures who (unlike, say, Brussels sprouts) have nervous systems and pain avoidance mechanisms.
B001IHJ97E|5.0|Brilliant researchers Lillian Reynolds and Michael Brace have developed a system of recording and playing back actual experiences of people. Once the capability of tapping into \\"higher brain functions\\" is added in, and you can literally jump into someone else's head and play back recordings of what he or she was thinking, feeling, seeing, etc., at the time of the recording, the applications for the project quickly spiral out of control. While Michael Brace uses the system to become close again to Karen Brace, his estranged wife who also works on the project, others start abusing it for intense sexual experiences and other logical but morally questionable purposes. The government tries to kick Michael and Lillian off the project once the vast military potential of the technology is discovered. It soon becomes obvious that the government is interested in more than just missile guidance systems. The lab starts producing mind torture recordings and other psychosis inducing material. When one of the researchers dies and tapes the experience of death, Michael is convinced that he must playback this tape to honor the memory of the researcher and to become enlightened. When another researcher dies during playback the tape is locked away and Michael has to fight against his former colleagues and the government lackeys that now run his lab in order to play back and confront the scariest thing any of us will ever face,  death itself. Despite changing styles in special effects, this is a timeless and beautiful story that transcends the genre and, with Walken, Wood and Fletcher, becomes more than just a story about shiny gold tapes that record brain waves. It's more about immovable objects and irresistible forces and what happens when they collide. Watch it as an experience rather than as a scientific treatise and you will surely have a great ride.
0743487486|1.0|Kohn makes no distinction between different types of temperament in children. In that respect, he is no different than the Skinner-esque proponents of behaviourism. Assuming all children will behave (eventually) because they want to have a nice environment is doing a severe disservice to children; children come in all shapes, sizes, colors and personalities. While one child may love making mommy smile, another may delight in hearing loud noises and yet another may find pleasure in disassembling things and yet another may thrill to quiet introspective personal play and  yet another may love being in a large group doing what others do etc<br /><br />Kohn also makes the simplistic proposition that \\"consequence\\"= \\"conditional love\\"<br /><br />I honestly think conveying your love to a child is not limited by forms of discipline meted out as consequences for actions. I children must learn social cues, social norms and social consequences. Children's first social interactions are with their parents. There is no better and safer place for them to learn how to be properly social.<br /><br />No praise? Are you kidding me? Saying \\"goodjob!\\"  = \\"I only love you when you do what  I like\\" ? For real? Everyone likes hearing acknowledgement of accomplishment. Everyone. IN all cultures. Praise is acknowledgement of accomplishment NOT conditional \\"love\\" Praise is at least an acknowledgement of a task completed satisfactorily. Consider a child attempting to do something for the first time. HOW will that child even know they have done the task correctly if you do not tell them? Are they to somehow magically figure out everything on their own? Children are amazing learners but there are some times when even the best self-starters need to have guidance and clarification. \\"Good job!\\" doesn't just mean \\"you did what I want\\" It often means \\"you did that correctly!\\" which is inducement to do it again (which is what we call \\"practice\\") I cannot believe Kohn boils encouragement down to a theoretical stance of \\"conditional love\\"<br /><br />When my boss says \\"good job!\\" is he expressing love for me? I think not. He is saying he likes what I did and/or I did it correctly.<br />We live in a universe of consequences. Children must learn those possibilities. I think its important that we keep our reactions to our childrens attempts down to a system of encouragement and gentle guidance but we have to recognize that children NEED guidance, including limits and parameters, clearly defined.<br /><br />They are children; they cannot navigate the world on their own, they NEED feedback. encouragement and guidance doesn't have to be criticism or praise, but there's nothing wrong with a little praise now and then either - it shows the child consequences yet again.<br /><br />I honestly think Kohn hasn't much experience in the realm of dealing with challenging children.

0802473156|4.0|This book provides good insights and practical suggestions for established couples.  Not preachy or sappy, it is easy to read with pleasant and appropriate stories to illustrate the author's points.
B000JQU4TW|4.0|As one of the first books I read on my Kindle, this one will always be a little special for me.  The writing style took more than just a little getting used to, but overall it is a classic tale that was a lot of fun to read.  Not sure I'll do much more Oscar Wilde, but I'm glad to have read this one.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|The film was very informative.  Many people I know don't want to watch it because they believe ignorance is bliss.  I would like to see more stores offer Organic Foods.  I would also like to keep the information about how foods are labeled very available so we know who deemed a product organic.  But honestly, I don't know who to trust either.  The different labels are hard for a normal consumer to figure out.  When I can't decide what a label really means, I don't feel that I am getting a good product, just an expensive one with a \\"green\\" label.  I'd like to see where organic farms are in my area.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I simply want to say that this album is amazing. I especially got connected to \\"In Another Time.\\" Although I don't think Soldier is their best album it is my opinion that the song \\"In Another Time\\" is one of their best, ever. You can't keep making the same record over and over again... as some have said it doesn't compare to their last records. Opinions are going to be different as this album is different but, to me its still Sade. Its smooth, meaningful, sexy, and fulfilling. Oh, and it went #1 its first week out selling about half a million I believe :) I mean to say, today there is so much out there that is overrated, over-produced, too hyped.. that its a bit sad. So, I personally find it refreshing to have Sade, Paul, Stuart, and Andrew back on the market. Thank You.
B001PA0FFO|1.0|I don't like making negative comments but this time I feel obliged to warn people out there. This is just an over-over-rated movie. I insisted on watching it yesterday but although whatever I have tried I felt in to sleep.  What a waste of time!
B000002B30|5.0|My husband and I just loved this album. All the best songs were on it. We are children of the 60's, but Bruce really was fantastic.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Either you will love or hate this album. So decide first, if you are after metal work then look for other Opeth albums. But if you like Pink Floyd style or soft-slow-melodic music, then most probably you would want to listen this album over an over. . I didn't expect that it would be so much beautiful before I gave it a turn. Very good compilations from very talented musicians
0545123267|3.0|I actually enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. It wasn't mind blowing but it was entertaining at times and it kept me interested. I did see quite a few plot holes and that is why I can't give this book more than 3 stars. I would have liked to know more about Sam and why he only got a few years while the rest of the werewolf's got so much more. Also I felt like Stiefvater focused too much on the romance and not enough on her were lore and overall plot. I hope that in the next installment she makes Graces' parents more active in her life. It seemed like Stiefvater made them absent and neglectful just to give Grace and Sam a way to be together without all the parental hassle. Teenage girls should know that this is not something that generally happens and most parents would at least realize the extra person living in their home no matter how clueless they are about everything else. I will continue on with this series but I have to say that I have read the first paragraph and the future does not look so good.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|You will not be dissappointed with this video. Its a must see! You will not look at food the same way again. Thanks to the producers for not keeping people like me in the dark about what is really going on with the farming and food industry. Tax payers need to know. Rent it or buy it but its a must see!
0812550706|5.0|I kept putting this book at the bottom of my TBR since I had so many to read but then I picked it for my reading challenge and I am so glad that I did. I ended up loving this book to my complete surprise.<br />Enders Game takes place in another time and deals with planets, new creatures, and interplanetary traveling. I have never been a fan of \\"starship trooper\\" type books but this one grabs you from the beginning. Ender is the worlds only hope of surviving another war with the buggers (a type of alien). Ender is only 6 when he enters the training school and you get to see him develop into a world class hero. As with all hero's he has his faults and can be quite scary but in the end he steps up to the plate. I wish he would have been older when he was picked but I understand that this is set in another time.<br />I really enjoyed this book and I will continue on with the series.
0375842209|5.0|For the longest time, I avoided this book because I felt Death as a narrator was gimicky. How very wrong I was! And thank god I came across the audio version by Allan Corduner which adds just the perfect element of wry humor to devastating effect.    Death is not a gimicky narrator-he is the perfect narrator. It's gently done, lovingly even.     I fell so in love with the characters in this novel that it felt like death in my own family as I learned their different fates. (And that's not a spoiler because eventually everyone dies, in real life and fiction.)    There was so much warmth and love in this book that it repeatedly brought me to tears--yes, even whilst being narrated by Death and being set in Nazi Germany! I will never forget Rosa Hubermann's constant Saumensching and Saukerling, and the gleeful joy of the children of Himmel Street, who manage to be good people when the world around them is evil. Rudy's teddy bear and Liesel's snowman spring to mind as instant examples.    Not only is the plot insanely compelling and well-crafted, the author's language is exquisite. I would often rewind the CD to listen again to a particular sentence.    I can't describe how much I loved this book. I wanted to hug both the author and the audio narrator (and actually, come to think of it, the fictional narrator).
B001OQCV2E|1.0|Buildings blow up. Land falls into the sea. Google-eyed, open-mouthed actors scream their lines while failing miserably at being humorous or even slightly entertaining.  The sentimental scenes are more agonizing than the earth coming apart at the seams.<br /><br />There are way too many narrow escapes. Every vehicle know to man is used to show the destructive forces just seconds away from killing Cusack and his family. First it's in a house, then it's in a car, an airplane, a motor home, another airplane, a cruise ship and a gigantic ark. When the writer ran out of ideas of what to use next he used a car coming out of the rear of an airplane just moments before the airplane crashed. It doesn't get more dreadful than this.<br /><br />Even the special effects are non-impressive without a decent plot. There is nothing that I haven't already seen on the History Channel's Life Without People. I think this movie actual stole a couple of them, such as the Sistine Chapel falling apart and ripping through Michael Angleo's painting.<br /><br />This movie is a stink bomb.<br /><br />And as a side note, we use inches and feet in America, not meters. I wish Hollywood would respect that in movies made in and for America.
0439023491|5.0|This book picks up in the lives of Katniss and Peeta following their win of The Hunger Games, and their win over The Capitol. They live on eggshells as they try to keep The Capitol pacified, but unrest is rising in the districts. And The Capitol is not happy-- not one little bit.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much, as I don't want to give up the twists and turns that make this book so much fun. Katniss remains as spirited and impulsive as she was in the first book. Poor Gale is in torment over the relationship between Katniss and Peeta, but is still strong and convicted. Peeta and Prim remain as sweet and good and pure as driven snow, and Haymitch remains the antithesis of them, tied up and buried under his past with the help of a drunken haze. The mysterious entanglements of the districts, their history, The Capitol, and underground movements slowly begin to unravel and reveal themselves.<br /><br />If you've read The Hunger Games, and you enjoyed it, please, please, please crack open Catching Fire today. You won't be disappointed!
0670021652|5.0|Having enjoyably read Gilberts previous book - Eat, Pray, Love - I was thrilled to hear from a friend that she had published this new book.  I love the way this woman wrestles through issues, demons, in her life.  Her authenticity is refreshing.  The depth of research on her topic is obvious.  Thus, in this book, you will learn a lot more about Elizabeth and her family as well as about marriage.    As a pastor/counselor I would highly recommend this book to anyone either contemplating marriage or within a marriage.  There are a plethora of nasty cultural notions out there that need the light of day focused on them. Elizabeth does this well.  She had to.  She had been married, divorced, didn't want to get remarried, but would have to again - to continue in a relationship with Filipe, the man she loved.    This book wanders somewhat naturally from her real-life, personal experiences, then into brief forays into research about marriage.  Her presentation of the academics of matrimony are almost always just enough to explain her context, yet not so much as to bore the reader.  Similarly, her travels and nostalgic recollections are just enough to engage the reader, yet not so much as to create a book merely composed of the anectdotal.  I found this a creative and useful blend of the profound and the personal.    Lack of knowledge, as well as fear to duplicate a previously noxious life encounter, predictably paralyzes millions of us from moving into joy.  Elizabeth had created and existed in a box of anxiety regarding marriage.  Circumstances, though, well described in her book, compelled her to re-examine her self-imposed parameters for relationships.  Her study was self-help, cognitive-behavioral therapy at its best. She chose to admit and confront her preconceived notions about marriage with the facts.  She chose to listen to the experiences of friends and family who shared with her the truth that her fears, though legitimate, were not the whole story.     Finally, Elizabeth breaks free from her past and embraced what she had previously and adamently rejected - marriage.  Armed with a revised and healthy perspective, she chose to marry her beloved.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This was a wonderful expose on the veil that the food industry is trying to pull over out eyes! It's scary, but the good news is that there IS something YOU can do about the food you eat! You vote three times a day as to what kind of food we want! Watch this documentary and share it with as many people as possible. We have the right to, and demand healthy, nutritious food!
B000YDI9UG|5.0|These boots are supremely comfortable and waterproof (they also look fantastic).  I have a number of pairs of these and wear them on a daily basis.  The boots aren't insulated (which I like), but offer room for thicker socks when it gets cold.    The soles of these boots wear down very quickly (especially the forefoot).  I understand wear patterns will be different for all people, but most of my shoes wear evenly and pretty slowly.  Within 5 months of regular use, I wear through the forefoot of these boots.    That said, the uppers of the boot are very rugged and durable and (after a number of years of use) don't show any signs of wearing out in my lifetime.  These boots can be resoled quite easily by any shoe repair place.  After putting a nice heavy-duty Vibram sole on, the boots are pretty much bulletproof and will last forever.    I'm not the type of person who typically will deal with things like having a boot resoled, but these things are so good, it's worth it.  Even with the hassle and expense of resoling, I still give these a solid 5 star rating - that should tell you what you need to know!
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Wow! James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" is stunning and meaningful. This movie was one of the best I've seen in 2010. I went in the movie not interested but came out really wanting to watch more. The 3D version I watched made it all the better, although the movie would have been able to stand alone.  The 3D made the landscape and visuals more intense and eye appealing than I imagined.   Pandora is the planet that the valuable Unobtainium resides. The military contractors are interested in going after this despite their hardships with the Na'vi people. The Na'vi people are in tune with everything on their planet and vice versa, their connection with the mother tree is interesting. Pandora is going to be uprooted and destroyed if the military contractors don't get what they want. This is where the main actor, Jake, comes in. His DNA is going to be transported into the \\"avatars\\" that the scientist created to interact with the real avatars.  Jake is joined with two other scientist one played by Sigourney Weaver. They all become avatars and interact within the village. Little did Jake know that he would fall for a female warrior, Na'vi, Neytiri played by Zoe Saldana. She doesn't know Jake works for the military and scientist to figure out their way of life.  Many times the romantic bit ruins what the movie is really about, but this movie is different because of the way producers incorporate the use of nature and visuals to amuse the audience. The movie is pretty predictable because of the romance novel bit and all, but I think that the movie is still powerful even if it did incorporate some of the lovey dovey stuff. There are a couple twists and turns within the movie that were interesting to watch.  Overall I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.

B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Certainly the best in the series, this slasher film spoof is equal parts funny and scary (and gross).  With sequences that will elicit fully on barrel laughs, and maybe even some tears, as well as sequences that will turn the stomach, `Scary Movie' has enough going for it to far outweigh the films tendency to overindulge in it's own silliness.<br /><br />Yes, this movie is stupid, but it balances it's intelligence with a precise humor that was kind of lost in the sequels (especially the 3rd film).<br /><br />The film is an amalgam of all things `slasher', a genre that really rose to fame in the late 90's.  With throwbacks to everything from `Scream' to `I Know What You Did Last Summer', as well as a brilliant spoof in `The Blair Witch Project'; `Scary Movie' certainly makes the best use of the goods at its disposal.  Sometimes the film does tend to veer off into territory that is far too silly for its own good, but it manages to maintain a firm hold on just what is `funny', making up for its preposterousness the best way that it can.<br /><br />One thing to know is that this film is ridiculously offensive (as is the 2nd one) and so the jokes, while funny, are not going to make everyone happy, so if you have an adverse reaction to stereotypical jokes done in a grossly demeaning (and perverse) way then stay far away from this one.<br /><br />As far as the acting is concerned, this young cast is chuck full of talented comedians.  Even Carmen Electra surprisingly makes her `Drew Barrymore' impersonation as memorable (well, not quite AS memorable) as Drew herself.  Thankfully, they chose a real star to carry this film.  Anna Farris is hysterical, and this is the film that MADE her.  She carries all of these films (even though the films themselves become rather insulting) and her comedic timing is just impeccable.  It's easy to see, when watching this film, why she became so big and why she'll stick around for some time.  The Waynes brothers do what they do (Marlon is BY FAR the funnier one, but he knows his gimmick and takes total advantage of it), and Lochlyn Munro steals every scene he's in.<br /><br />In the end, if you like the genre (parody, not slasher) then you will LOVE what is done here.  I take that back, if you love EITHER genre, you should love this film.<br /><br />Just, don't be a prude.s his gimmick and takes total advantage of it), and Lochlyn Munro steals every scene he's in.

B0026P3G12|5.0|This is a beautiful CD - wonderful, relaxing music.  The lady has such talent.
B000AYELVA|4.0|The reason I use that statement as my review title is that, while this film is good, much like `Spider-Man' and `Batman Begins', this film is trumped massively by the sequel.  That aside, this film is still very good for the genre that it finds itself in.  Superhero movies can be hard to make because there are so many devoted fans to please, and there is no way that one can perfectly transfer a comic book to the big screen.  Still, as far as they come, this is one of the better installments.<br /><br />It's a shame that the third film was such a cluttered mess (it's still better than `Spider-Mess 3').<br /><br />This film establishes the conflict between former friends Professor Xavier (Professor X) and Magneto, formerly known as Eric Lensherr.  Lensherr, facing prejudice his entire life, suffers greatly at the hands of an unkind and unsympathetic human race, who regard mutants as below them and continue to misunderstand and mistreat them.  Xavier and Lensherr, once comrades, are now rivals as their viewpoints on the world have begun to contradict one another.  Xavier believes in patience, for he feels that humans are universally good and that they will learn to accept mutants as equals, but Lensherr has grown to despise humanity and feels that the only key to happiness would be a human-free (and mutant inhabited) world.<br /><br />Thus sets the basis for the first installment in the X-Men franchise, and as Xavier's school for mutants and Magneto's band of thugs set off in search of the same girl, a young mutant named Rogue, chaos ensues.<br /><br />That good kind of action sequence chaos.<br /><br />When it comes to superhero films, the most important (or one of the most important) things to consider is the cast.  You have leagues of devoted fans waiting to put a face to the hero they have followed for years, and so `nailing' that aspect of the film is key.  For a film that is littered with heroes and villains, `X-Men' definitely has some inspired casting.  For any fan of the comic, I think there was only ONE choice for Professor X, and they got that one right.  Near unknowns (I say near because they weren't, and still aren't, BIG NAME stars) Famke Janssen and James Marsden filled out their respective roles very nicely (Janssen is a perfect Jean Grey) and Oscar winner Anna Paquin was the perfect choice for Rogue.  Ian McKellen is perfect as Magneto, and while I find that Storm didn't have much to chew on, Berry was a nice (if a tad obvious) choice.<br /><br />But seriously, this is the film that introduced Hugh Jackman to the world, and no matter how awesome the rest of the cast may be, Wolverine was the most important casting decision, and Jackman is absolutely outstanding!<br /><br />It lacks the polish of `X2: United', but it sets a nice tone for the franchise and really works in the origin stories without feeling rushed, stuffed or forced.  There is plenty of action, drama, romance and wit; and a naked blue Rebecca Romijn serves up some oddly stimulating eye-candy.  For what it is, this movie is pretty great.  I'd give it a solid B+, verging on an A-.only ONE choice for Professor X, and they got that one right.

It lacks the polish of `X2: United', but it sets a nice tone for the franchise and really works in the origin stories without feeling rushed, stuffed or forced.  There is plenty of action, drama, romance and wit; and a naked blue Rebecca Romijn serves up some oddly stimulating eye-candy.  For what it is, this movie is pretty great.  I'd give it a solid B+, verging on an A-.
0812973992|5.0|An excellent novel...engrossing, vividly written, lyrical, and ambitious...captures the experience of living in New York from the perspectives of several characters who turn out to have unseen connections to one another. The characters are unique and interesting, and the language throughout the book is very striking. I didn't want it to end.
B00005V9IJ|4.0|Everyone that I know either loves this movie or hates it.  They either find it completely engrossing or mind-numbingly boring.  I'm kind of in the middle.  I find it a tad long, but I find Hanks to be surprisingly riveting (I'm not always sold on his talent) and his strong performance carries the film for me.  It has to, since he is the only person on screen for nearly the entire running length.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Chuck Noland, a FED-EX systems engineer who finds himself stranded on an island for four years after the plain he is on crashes into the ocean during a terrible storm.  He survives, obviously, but the experience has a lasting effect on Chuck.<br /><br />For me, it is hard to really build a film based solely on a man's solitary survival.  There is not a whole lot you can do, and while the film's execution of Chuck's adventures are startlingly engaging, when the film ended I felt as if it was just beginning.  For me, the most intriguing aspect of this story is how Chuck survives AFTER he comes home to find the life he left behind a mere memory.  Yes, his escapades on the island are necessary to establish growth and that survival instinct (and the way that Zemeckis films the island itself perfectly establishes to `gravity' of the whole experience) but when all is said and done, this is about how this experience CHANGES a person, and I feel like we only witnessed to very beginning of that change.<br /><br />Alas, I still really like this movie.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, Tom Hanks is not an actor I am usually drawn to.  I find a lot of his work highly overrated and even gimmicky and amateurish (his two Oscar wins themselves are disgusting) but here he transcends gimmick (I mean, this is a gimmicky character) and develops a REAL man.  He commands the screen 100% of the time, and never resorts to taking advantage of the situation, but sells himself the entire time.  This is a powerhouse performance, one that rises in the ranks with me the more I see it.  I think that Hanks' performance is also a reason why I hate the ending of the film.  He was doing such a riveting job that I really wanted him to sink his teeth into Chuck's `afterlife' SOOOOO much (no, he doesn't die...by afterlife I meant `life after his rescue').<br /><br />If I could reshoot or reedit this film I would be so happy.<br /><br />Anyways, in the end `Cast Away' is a very good film.  It has been mentioned (and I agree) that this film lacks a tad of the emotional punch (emotional `human' punch) that it tries to convey, but I feel that that punch would have been achieved had Chuck's story continued.ore I see it.

B000F6YW0S|5.0|Andre Segovia was the first classical, accoustic guitarist I ever heard. In my ignorance and innocence, I did not know Segovia saw the young John as being one of the \\"chosen.\\" The first time I heard this album, there was a freak ice storm in Wilmington, NC. The house had an old sun porch--three sides of glass facing into the woods, near Bradley Creek Sound. It was a perfect day as the sun streamed through iced down trees creating rainbows and shimmers -- every colour your eye could capture; ice sparkles like the sun on an early morning ocean rolling. A slight breeze would take your breath. It was a Spirit Day, 1982 maybe.<br /><br />I had an old record player with a major mechanical error. It stopped and replayed anything you put on it. The John Williams record had a big fat scratch at the end, that kicked that record arm back to start over and over and over again -- working beautifully with the mechanical malfunction. It was my first experience listening hard to classical guitar. It played over and over and over. It was one of those times of tuly hearing all the way down in your bones and deep inside your heart. My striped kitten, Ernie, lay on my chest all afternoon and tears fell down my cheeks the whole day from the exquisite magnitude of overwhelming beauty. Everything ever seen, felt, thought, heard the total mix was coming from fingertip to string to soul. This recording for someone brand new or someone with an old ear is perfection. I've bought it and given it away too many times to count. I will continue to do just that, but for now, it's my copy and I'm wearing it out. Priceless sound.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Love them or hate them, the Coen brothers know how to get your attention.  For me, this is surely one of their best films, and it is one that I have grown to love (considerably) over the years.  It sports Clooney's best performance to date (seriously) and one of the smartest scripts of the decade (or forever), using the powerful `Odyssey' as comic relief.  The humor is strictly `Coen' style, which is why it may not be ideal for everyone, but you can't help but totally respect what they were able to do here.<br /><br />I mean, this is genius, whether you `like' it or not.<br /><br />Set in the 1930's, `O Brother, Where Art Thou' tells of the adventures of three escaped convicts (Everett, Pete and Delmar), as they search for hidden treasure.  In true `Homer' fashion, the three convicts come across a slew of strange character that play a central part in their journey (including a brilliantly realized side-plot involving the KKK).<br /><br />The film reeks of style, period drama brilliance oozing from every nook and cranny of the film.  The comedic timing is flawless, and it is one of those films that really helps establish a star.  A lot of people make claim that George Clooney is a great actor, and while I like him, I find that he was certainly better `before' he became big.  His star persona skyrocketed in 2005 after he garnered Oscar nominations for his action (which he won for) and his directing, but his early 00 work is far better than what he's been putting out as of late.  His work in this film, as well as `The Perfect Storm' and `Solaris', is some of his best work ever.  I find that I appreciate George as a comedic actor over a dramatic one, his that is why his performance in `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' will remain my favorite work from him, ever.<br /><br />The film retains an avenue of suspense, which only helps sell the comedic overtones (think `Fargo', which would have been pointless without the dramatic underlining).  This is a stunning example of what the Coen brothers are capable of, and why they will be remembered as one of those directorial pairs that helped shape the way we look at cinema.<br /><br />Funny, charming, dark, mysterious; full of breathtaking cinematography, appropriate (and catchy) music and memorable performances (John Goodman, a Coen staple, is magnificent as always), `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is a film you won't soon forget.e Coen brothers are capable of, and why they will be remembered as one of those directorial pairs that helped shape the way we look at cinema.<br /><br />Funny, charming, dark, mysterious; full of breathtaking cinematography, appropriate (and catchy) music and memorable performances (John Goodman, a Coen staple, is magnificent as always), `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is a film you won't soon forget.
0375842209|5.0|My Rating:  5 stars isn't enough!    How do I, as a book blogger, review a book that is wrought with so much emotion and so much angst and turmoil that I was sobbing by the end of the book?  How can I adequately put into words how much of an impact this book had on me as a human being?  I honestly don't know if it is possible to review this book effectively, but I'll give it my best shot!    I am a huge fan of historical fiction, especially of events in and around World War II.  The Holocaust was an absolutely horrifying event in our world's history (and horrifying is putting it mildly), but I am, for whatever reason, drawn towards these types of fictional and non-fictional accounts of WWII.  I don't know why.  I break down crying every time I read a book about this time period, but I continue to seek out more of it.  I wish I could explain it.      The Book Thief is a unique story in that it is narrated by Death.  I was a bit leery at first because I wasn't sure how this type of narration would play out through the entire novel.  I have to say that it worked wonderfully and I can't imagine the book told in any other way, without losing the power and overall feeling of the story.  From the very first page, Death hooks the reader with His (Her?) account of his many visits to Germany during WWII.  But, this story isn't just about Death, even though he was around quite a bit during that time.  It is a story about a young German girl named Liesel Meminger, otherwise known as The Book Thief.  It is a story about how books can help a person survive in a period of utter despair.  It is a story of relationships; of love; of friendship; and of the power of the written word.      I've written and re-written this review many times.  I've decided not to go into any details because I don't want to give away the magic of the novel.  It is spellbinding, but heart-wrenching.  It is a book that must be experienced first-hand.  No review could possibly do it justice.    I will leaveit at that.    Jennifer  [...]
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|The best picture of 2009 wasn't a movie about giant blue aliens with a plot stolen from DANCES WITH WOLVES.  Nor was the best picture of 2009 a low-budget film about a military bomb squad in Iraq.  Both of these movies are good movies. However, neither can compare to the elegance, beauty, and simplicity of UP.<br /><br />Though there are other characters in the movie, UP is the story of Carl Fredricksen (Ed Asner).  The first fifteen minutes of the film touchingly tells the story of Carl's life.  He grew up wanting to experience adventure, married the girl of his dreams, and together they lived a very happy-though sometimes bittersweet-life. By the time the opening sequence has concluded, we already have an appreciation for Carl and a longing to have known even more about his deceased wife, Ellie.<br /><br />Carl is old, but he's also determined.  Skyscrapers and strip malls surround the old house that he and Ellie so painstakingly restored and though the land developer has offered to pay Mr. Fredricksen handsomely for his home and property, he refuses to sell.  However, in the end, through a careless act on Carl's part and a huge wrangling of the judicial system by the developer, Carl is forced to sell his property and ordered to move.  But, good old Carl is stubborn and sets about turning his entire home into a giant airship through the use of thousands of helium-filled balloons.  When the men from the retirement home come to take him away, Carl leaves them behind as he flies up, up, and away.<br /><br />Carl thinks he's alone as he begins his journey to see Paradise Falls in South America, the dream destination he and Ellie always wanted to go.  However, there's a stowaway aboard on the front porch, a Wilderness Scout named Russell (Jordan Nagai) that Carl thought he had gotten rid of by sending on a snipe hunt.  Carl reluctantly agrees to take Russell with him, but on the condition that Russell will go home once they reach Paradise Falls.  But the journey to paradise is filled with all kinds of strange and even dangerous adventures: terrifying heights, thick vegetation, talking dogs, rare endangered birds, and an ancient explorer bent on capturing his prey no matter what the cost.<br /><br />Unlike 2008's WALL-E, UP doesn't have an agenda.  Instead, it's a story about one man's redemption.  Carl is a good man who lived a good life, but the death of his beloved Ellie not only turned him crotchety, but caused him to lose his way.  It takes the unbridled honesty and passion of a child to get Carl back on track and face what he could become, Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer).<br />Of course, if that's not enough for you, UP also features all kinds of comedy for all ages.  Kids will love Dug and the rest of the talking dogs.  Adults will appreciate the zingy one-liners Carl delivers.  There are also all kinds of allusions throughout the movie (e.g. the dogs in the airplanes repeat lines taken directly from STAR WARS).<br /><br />UP has great characters, moving story, and witty dialog.  Simply stated, it's the best movie of 2009.<br /><br />The regular DVD includes the shorts \\"Partly Cloudy\\" and \\"Dug's Special Mission\\". \\"Partly Cloudy\\" features a stork sent to deliver dangerous baby critters.  The stork longs to have a regular delivery like the other storks, but in the end realizes just how important his job is.  As a side note, in watching UP you can catch a glimpse of a few of the clouds from \\"Partly Cloudy\\".  \\"Dug's Special Mission\\" illustrates what happens to Dug immediately preceding his discovering of Carl and Russell in the Jungle.kinds of strange and even dangerous adventures: terrifying heights, thick vegetation, talking dogs, rare endangered birds, and an ancient explorer bent on capturing his prey no matter what the cost.

B001OQCV2O|4.0|My take will be short.  While i liked the special effects of the visual, and sound, and the end of the world story line, I disliked the thought of leaving our intelligence behind.  Save to crooks in Washington and to h*ll with the engineers,teachers,doctors,inventors,mechanics,carpenters,and strong labor force to get things started again.  In other words, the backbone of our civilization.  Yes, I would like to live in a world with all the politicians, and greedy stingy rich folks!  NOT.
B000002IV8|5.0|Being a really big fan of riff-oriented metal, OVERKILL simply does just that for me.<br />They're truly all about GROOVE and LYRICS on this album. I like to put it as their GRUNGE offering if you will. Since they've mastered the speed metal aspect of thrash, OVERKILL delivers my all time favorite guitar riffs, hooks and sick grooves on I HEAR BLACK.

0810994739|2.0|In this book, Greg's brother Rodrick, takes charge.  I liked it, but it didn't seem as funny as the 1st, 3rd and 4th book.  That's why I only gave it 2 stars.  I really would have liked it to be funnier.  It would have been a 4 or 5 star book instead of a 2 star book.  I loved the part when his grandma said the only thing she got from Greg was a sign that said \\"I hate you grandma\\", but that was the only part I liked.  I don't think it was worth reading.  Take my advice, read all the other books before this one.  Also, try to luagh as much as you can![I sure didn't!]~APRIL MEADOWBROOK      Gerg Heffley is at it again this time better. Greg jions the swim team. But Greg is not that good at swimming. When he gets back to school everyone screams and runs away Greg has the cheese touch. Greg and his best friend try to talk in a secret languge it dosen't work and he gets sent home from a sleepover and you should read this book it is awesome. It made my laugh out loud. ~ mad dad

I wish there were 6 books to this series instead of 5. I think this book should have a Newberry it's so good. The reason I gave this book 5 stars is, because there's no boring parts in this book.

B002S9DRA6|5.0|This album took me by surprise.  I had no idea it even existed before randomly walking into a record store and running into it.  Needless to say, I had to have it.  This very reasonably-priced box set contains 3 discs.  The first disc is their second greatest hits collection, the second is an impressive collection of remixes, and the third is a disc of sound bites from Enigma mastermind Michael Cretu.  The aim of this compilation seems to be the appeasement of casual Enigma fans, as their prior box set, 15 Years After, was as extraordinary as it was expensive and bulky.  The album's artwork, both inside and out, is identical to that box set.  Pity, because Cretu could've gotten very creative with some original artwork.  Still, it doesn't detract from the quality of this set.    Disc 1 basically consists of all their officially-released singles, save for \\"The Eyes of Truth\\", \\"Hello and Welcome\\" and \\"The Same Parents\\".  Unlike 2001's greatest hits package, LoveSensualityDevotion, this one is ONLY the hits.  The songs are presented chronologically (a rarity nowadays) and in their full radio-edit glory, and for the first time presented as separate and un-joined songs.  Hardcore Enigma fans may be put off by not including the originals, but in my humble opinion, this compilation works well as a showcase of the songs that put Enigma where they are today.  Also missing from this compilation is any semblance of their sixth album, A Posteriori.  However, seeing as there were no official singles from that album, one can see why the canceled single release \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\" is missing.  One really great aspect of this disc, however, are the songs from the first album, MCMXC a.D.  This album is unique in that three of its four singles were released as remixes rather than the album versions, and I'm glad to say that they are presented as such here.  This includes the sensational \\"Orthodox Version\\" of the second single, \\"Mea Culpa\\", which is worth the price of admission alone.Previously available only in the music video and the CD single for the song (long out of print), it's nice to finally see it on an Enigma compilation.  As the album moves from the first album to the last, it's refreshing to hear how Enigma has evolved.  Five stars for this disc alone.    Disc 2 is a remix collection.  Michael Cretu has always been fond of his remixes, and this time he's done Enigma proud in this respect.  Enigma's last remix compilation was somewhat lacking, but this time around, with the inclusion of post 2001 albums, the collection seems complete.  And this time, it's the last album, Seven Lives Many Faces, that's missing from this disc.  Still, it's a great companion to the hits presented in the first disc.    Disc 3 is called The Lost Ones.  The title is misleading, however, as these eleven untitled songs aren't really songs at all, let alone true Enigma songs.  They're merely ideas, as stated by Cretu in the linear notes.  Each song has sound effect, synth effect or other tidbit, and the rest of the song revolves around that idea.  Cretu states the point of this is to basically see how an idea of a song begins, which may lead to a \\"hit song\\".  It's a curious choice for a man who once stated he'd never release incomplete or inadequate material, but these sound bites are intriguing.  Some are good, some are bad, but at this point the third disc is just gravy.    Overall, this is a modest little collection from Michael Cretu to the world.  At $24, it's a steal, and well worth a listen for anyone who's already a fan, or for anyone who wants to hear some of the best ambient electronica-infused songs of the last 20 years.
0375842209|5.0|I must admit, it took me a while to get used to reading the format of The Book Thief.  It is the first novel that I have ever read that is narrated by Death himself.  Quite the ambitious task I think to have Death your narrator but in this case, Zusak succeeds brilliantly.  This is the best book about the holocaust I have ever read.    Death is an important theme and character in the novel.  He tells us this story in a startlingly off hand, objective and unsympathetic way.  The novel goes from both sad to satirically humorous. The author took a big risk considering a weighty subject matter as vast and deep as the holocaust.  But it wisely does not focus on the holocaust itself, but rather how some German people were affected by it. So many books have been written about this event but The Book Thief puts its own unique spin on it.  It truly is unforgettable.    The prose is sustained, brilliant, and luminous and perhaps most of all haunting, page after page, sentence after sentence.    The way the story is told isn't designed to move one to tears, but I always felt something strong while reading The Book Thief, like a current of electricity moving through me as I devoured the pages.  Don't be fooled by the length of The Book Thief, it races by at an alarming pace.    The plot itself is rather simple, focusing more on thoughts and characters and not so much on events.  A young girl is abandoned by her mother and loses her brother tragically at the beginning of the story and goes to live with her new foster family.    Her foster dad is an accordion player and her foster mother is a ferocious and mean spirited maid in stark contrast to the kindness of the foster father.  She moves into this home at age 11 and the story unfolds over a three year period during World War II in Germany.  This really isn't a story focusing on the holocaust though, even though the family later hides a Jew in their basement for a stretch of time.    This is more of a story about how poorer Germans reacted to Hitler and what was going on around them at the time.  The novel focuses on a particular poor street in Germany and the neighbors and residents of that street.  This young girl is the centerpiece of the story and she begins to steal books during a time when books were banned and book burning was common.    Over time she will gather a modest collection of these books. She makes some close friends, two boys, on her street.  We get to know them quite well along with the Mayor's wife who develops a distant, interesting relationship with this girl.    Because the story is told by Death, you can't help but feel the impending gloom in the air especially during this fragile war time period.      The Book Thief is an important book, and one that flows much like poetry and has a calm melancholy confidence about it. It carries an ability to remain extraordinary despite on the surface a rather ordinary story. The story is all about the characters and I won't give anything away but when you remember who the storyteller is you can't expect a nice and rosy ending.  The characters are vivid and real.    The ideas and characters are what make this book a masterpiece not the story.  It is unlike anything you will ever read, a book flowing with both beauty and sadness and a haunting ending that will stay with you long after the last page is turned, a true quality of a great and memorable book.  The Book Thief is one of the best books I have ever read.    Grade: A

B001ANYDAO|4.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend at work - it was very intersting (to say the least) with the facts and analyses, and more than once I went \\"why, of course!\\" when a point was made: not because I already knew the answer, but the author had a nice way of leading you to it, based upon facts, that made the lghtbulb go off in your head.<br /><br />I thought the first 90% of the book was great; the last part about his own familial history was interesting, but took away from his other points in the book.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading more of his work.

B0025KVLU6|5.0|I've read many of the reviews of this album, cd, whatever, and I can't help but feel intensly disappointed by the 2010 perspective of this incredible work. You have no idea what the hell you're talking about unless you were there, in 1968, living this whole maelstrom. The draft, Viet Nam, civil rights, assassination, a very real and imminent nuclear threat, Cold War, Red Chinas' Cultural Revolution. It was a mess something of the order we're experiencing in the scope of this economic depression and all this context seems lost through time. The Beatles were the home base. They represented a sense of comfort and even clarity in a time when there wasn't much around. As confused as this album may sound to you, there was something there for everybody and everybody I know has a different favorite from this release. In that sense, it's a masterpiece. I mean, who loves everything Mozart wrote? Mozart operas are pompous, complex, emotional roller coasters, much like the White Album. It reverberated with uncertain direction and accurately reflected it's time in history extremely well.
067101756X|5.0|I read this book a number of years ago now but I feel it best addresses the question of the Alien presence from someone high up in the circles of both government and military, the liason between them for Ike's administration. This is as credible a witness to the reality of the alien presence as you could ever find, his credentials impeccable in the eyes of those all around him denying the truth of the matter. I see him as one of the true unsung heroes of my lifetime, not afraid to speak the truth of what he knew regardless of the danger of the repercussions. Corso died a mysterious death a few years after this publication, like so many other government coverup whistleblowers before and after him. His son, Philip Corso Jr., now lectures worldwide regarding his father's revelations. I would highly reccommend
0764207407|5.0|Sense and Sensibility is probably my least favorite Jane Austen novel, and I've read them all. It never captured me like Pride & Prejudice's Darcy & Elizabeth's love story or even the impetuous Emma's mistaken matchmaking. But with Bethany House's new Insight Edition, Sense and Sensibility's long-lasting effect on culture finally, well, made Sense to me. I enjoyed it this time around, and this will certainly not be my last time to read this beloved classic.<br /><br />This new edition doesn't mess with the original text of S&S - at all! Quite the opposite -  it enhances the reader's experience.<br />The Editors point out little quirks and interesting facts found within the text, which had those notes not been there I would have missed it entirely!<br />Other footnotes are witty, knowledgeable and even have some fun tidbits about the movie variations.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed Sense and sensibility more the second time around thanks much in part to this insight edition! There are limitless editions of Sense and Sensibility available, but this one is by FAR my favorite.<br /><br />Thanks to Bethany House for providing this book for me to review!
B00192KCQ0|2.0|Let me first say that this is the best album Metallica has put out since the \\"Black\\" album and I (like everyone else) was very relieved that it was not Re-St. Anger. The songs on Death Magnetic are a return to thrash, and they even let Kirk play solos. Thank god! Metal wise, this is a pretty good album.    HOWEVER! They BOTCHED what would have been a 4 Star album by over producing all of the elements and clipping the music sound waves. The result is an album that sounds very flat, one dimensional, and soulless. You could light a match off how dry and dull this album sounds. How could this be? Kirk really shreds in some parts. It's true. Because they over produced every element(vocals, guitar, bass, drums) it leaves the songs with no dynamic musical range. The softest sounds are as LOUD as the loudest sounds on this album. The result is no depth in the music. There is no foreground or background in any of these songs. It's like comparing an episode of South Park(2D) to Pixar animation(3D). There's no comparison. This really sucks as a Metallica fan because by giving the music more range it would have made the songs much much better and listenable. For example, the intro to The Day That Never Comes would have been a lot better if they faded it in. But no, it starts out loud. Same with the piano/violin intro to The Unforgiven III. The song that suffers the most from the botched production is Suicide and Redemption. Unlike Orion or The Call of Ktulu, there is no dynamic interplay between the bass, drums, or guitar parts. They all stand side-by-side on this song, and it detracts from the epic feel this song is going for.    I bought this album the first week it came out. But if I would have known about poor production job, I would have passed on it. Now I have another Metallica coaster to set my beer on; along with Load, Reload, and St. Anger because I do not play this album. It is a HEADACHE to listen to.    My recommendation for anyone interested in this album is to download a few songs from Amazon before you purchase the album to see what it sounds like. If you can tolerate it, then buy the entire album, and even then pick it up used. Trust me, it's not worth paying full price for something you never play. It really is unfortunate because I have a nice stereo system which gets killer musical range, but I might as well play Death Magnetic on an old ghetto blaster with blown speakers for how distorted, flat, and loud the CD is. We can only hope and wait to see if one day Metallica will release a remastered version of Death Magnetic with a proper production job. Until then, I'm not playing it.     If you still need a metal fix and don't want to buy Metallica (I would not blame you) pick up Megadeth's \\"End Game.\\" End Game is a totally amazing album. It shreds, rips, and goes ballistic! [[ASIN:B002C6K7N0 Endgame]] is a 5 star album. And most importantly, MEGADETH KNOWS HOW TO PRODUCE AN ALBUM. The solos, riffs, bass, and drums all stand apart and work together to make End Game a KILLER album. Great job, Dave Mustaine! I think Metallica has something to learn from you.
B002ZG98J6|3.0|I have read all the books and enjoyed them very much.  I was anxious to see the movie.  It wasn't horrible, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Here is a list of some of the things I didn't care for:     - Percy was older than he was in the book, so where does that leave him to go as the series continues?  - Barely any mention of Kronos, who is the actual antagonist of the series  - The whole St. Louis scene was left out, moved to Nashville.  Having Percy control the Mississippi River rather than water out of drinking fountains would have been so much better.    - Medusa was so UGLY she turned people to stone when they looked at her.  In the movie she was awfully pretty with the exception of her hair.    - The movie lacked the banter, insults and sarcasm that made the book so much fun. The movie was almost too serious.    - Aries, Aphrodite and Hermes were left out altogether.  \  - Percy's sword was just a sword where as in the book it was almost a living entity with a name.  It was explained that no matter what happened to it, the sword would reappear in his pocket when he needed it.    - There was no connection between Annabeth and Luke as there was in the book.  This connection also plays an important part in the rest of the series.     But I said the movie wasn't horrible and here is what I liked:    - The guy playing Percy, although too old, did a good job.  - Grover was great.  - Most of the mythical creatures were very well done and the explanations for them were also good.  - Most of the fight scenes were very exciting  - The gods were portrayed well and of course they have the obligatory British accents.      My son, who has not read the books, enjoyed it and had no trouble following the story line.  My daughter, who is 6, enjoyed it as well and wasn't scared of any of the creatures or monsters.  The soundtrack was good.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The Hyper 212+ is a must-have heatsink for your CPU if you do not wish to pay for pricy water cooling.    -Price  Only $30, when most high-end heatsinks are priced at $50+ on NewEgg.  If you want your CPU to run cooler for a cheap price, the Hyper 212+ is perfect.  -Instructions  The manual has two to three pictures each step, along with the most minimal of a sentence that describes what the pictures want you to do.  You're better off watching the youtube video that Cooler Master uploaded.  -Installation  Once again, I strongly advise just throwing out the given instructions and view the video that Cooler Master has uploaded to youtube.  Installing was a bit tricky at first, one of the nuts refused to go the entire length of the screw, needed pliers to force it the rest of the way.  After attaching the backplate, the rest of the process went very smooth.    -Performance  I installed this heatsink to a week-old i5 750 CPU.  Temps were running 45C idle with stock heatsink.  After applying the Hyper 212+, the i5 dropped to 28C idle.  I have yet to encounter temperatures above 35C on heavy load.  Overclocking the i5 to 3.6GHz, the temps rise to 37C idle, which is simply amazing.  I previously tried to O/C with the i5's stock heatsink, and the temp skyrocketed to 65C after booting Windows.  -Additional Info  Comes with a 120mm fan attached onto the heatsink.  The metal clips make it very easy to remove the fan for heatsink installation.  Has an extra two metal clips in case you would like to add an additional fan on the opposite side for more airflow.  In terms of noise, my case fans are louder than the packaged 120mm fan.  The PC is positioned about 10 feet away from my bed, and I have no trouble sleeping because of noise.  The 212+ also came with its own thermal paste, a great little addition for those not wanting to spend $10 for a couple uses.    The only negative standpoint I would have with this heatsink is the size.  Luckily, my case has a sidepanel window which bows out, allotting JUST enough clearance for the Hyper 212+ to fit.  Make sure you measure the inside of your case before purchasing!    Other than water cooling, I have yet to purchase a heatsink that decreases the temperature by such a drastic amount.  It is a great product for a cheap price, and I will be purchasing this heatsink for every new rig I build.
B001QOGYFO|3.0|Filmed in Manitoba and Quebec, the relentless ice, wind, and snow in this film didn't all have to be computer-generated. This film is supposed to be set in a research station at the Antarctic. There's a lot of blizzard here as people struggle hand-over-hand, holding onto the lifelines strung between buildings. Losing one's grip on those lines could mean death. It's possible to become disoriented just a few feet from one's destination in the blinding snows.    But death also comes from more sinister sources in this film. A mangled body is found out on the lonely stretches beyond the compound. Then the homicidal attacks strike closer to home - inside the station itself. Could these attacks somehow be connected to the airplane crash we see in the opening scene of the film? We're immediately plunged into the killing coldness of the Antarctic with a flashback to that 1950's Soviet plane crashing into the wasteland with almost as much impact as the train wreck recreated so dramatically in the movie \\"The Fugitive.\\"    Kate Beckinsale plays a U.S. Marshall assigned to enforce the law at this outpost. Her tour of duty has so far involved her in nothing more serious than the theft of one scientist's illicitly grown marijuana buds. But once the murders start, all her skills are tested. Her suspicion that the current murders might indeed be related to that decades old, cold war crash seem as if they might be confirmed.    Mostly, we've seen this all before. Someone, or something, is running amok in the eerie isolation of an ice station. However, there are a few elements that distinguish this film. For one thing, after appearing in an early completely gratuitous cheesecake scene as she steps into a bath - Kate Beckinsale steps into a more serious role and is shown fighting on a par with the men at the station. Even in this day and age, it's rare to see a woman cast in a role of such casually assumed equal or even superior authority - a role in which she doesn't gain her staturethrough the height of her stiletto heels. Beckinsale remains pretty well bundled up most of the time, which might account for her not being confined to just a series of poses in superficial appearances.    Then Tom Skerritt turns in a good performance as the Doctor at the Research Station. All in all, this movie delivers some chills and makes you all the more glad you can curl up to watch it in front of a glowing fireplace rather than actually live it.
0517548232|5.0|The book is extremely lucid, and shows how far one can get just by thinking. It is interesting that the author describes the housing bubble which he did not live to see (this has been pointed out by a number of other reviewers), but what I find just as interesting, the section on imports and exports shows very clearly why making the USD the world's reserve currency has had (and continues to have) a destructive effect on the US economy (since it creates an impetus to hoard dollars [exactly what the chinese are doing] as opposed to spending them on US-produced goods).<br /><br />What I also find interesting (and depressing) is that a lot of the reviews of this are \\"religious\\": look at all of the one-star reviews -- none of them have any logical objection to Hazlitt, but they all say that they are (in effect) religiously opposed to it. Until people (and Amazon book reviewers are probably slightly more sentient than average) learn to think, we will continue on the current road to ruin.<br /><br />(the above was written before I had actually finished the book: now that I have I am even more impressed, because the last three chapters, on Inflation, Savings, and Lessons learned are eerily relevant to the current crisis, and the last chapter is particularly depressing, since, despite Hazlitt's hope, the governments STILL are going on their merry way making things worse).
1591843162|5.0|basically - you have to follow your heart - otherwise, what's really the point of all of this?  This book reminds me in a way of Live Like A Fruit Fly (also on amazon)- a phenomenal book about finding your passion and following it blindly (well, almost blindly)
B0007PAMR4|5.0|This is a movie that makes you watch from beginning to end. If  you miss any you might not be able to follow what happens next. It makes you think and it gives you an insight to the thoughts of the characters. It is a great  movie!
B000HEWEEE|5.0|This is an amazing story with great casting and a great plot. \\"Frequency\\" meets \\"You've Got Mail\\". Pulls all the right heartstrings and draws you in from minute one with great camera work, good story line, characters that are very easy to relate to, and a perfect soundtrack. Reaches out to viewers of all ages. This is a movie I'd recommend for any Romance fan. Great film!!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I am autistic, high functioning, like Temple Grandin is, as well as being a visual thinker.  It is often very hard to explain to people in words what it is like, or why it's hard for me to do somethings NTs (neurotypicals or nonautistics for those that don't know) have no issues with, or why somethings bother me severely.  I usually get reactions that just being lazy or whining over nothing, when it's much more than that.    This film accurately captures what it is like for me, at least.  (Autism is extremely diverse, and what's true for one autistic won't be true for all)  And I finally have something I can show my friends and family and point to and say \\"This is what I've been trying to explain.\\"    Beyond the fact that I can simply relate to much of experiences and difficulties (at least in relation to autism), this film is extremely well made, and highly recommended.  It is highly enjoyable and entertaining to watch regardless of whether or not you you have any connection to autism.  Temple's life and character is an inspiration to all, and the lessons of her life can apply to anyone across the board.    Do watch.
1601251505|5.0|Sorry, everyone.  I would write a huge, massive, glowing review about how great this book is:  however, I am having far too much fun playing the game.  Paizo rocks, and Pathfinder is an absolute blast to play!  Get the book, play the game, and you won't be disappointed (unless you're a wotc employee.)
0307269981|2.0|This book abuses sex and advertisement in every way possible, at best it is the equivalent of a summer blockbuster. The whole book reads like this:<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br /><br />Salander walked to the kitchen and grabbed a bag of Doritos, her naked body contrasting the black LG refrigerator. She turned on her MacBook Pro while taking a sip of Pepsi. She remembered the visit she had made to Ikea two weeks ago.<br /><br />She had bought two Karlanda sofas with sand-coloured upholstery, five Po&auml;ng armchairs, two round side tables of clear-lacquered birch, a Svansbo coffee table, and several Lack occasional tables. From the storage department she ordered two Ivar combination storage units and two Bonde bookshelves, a TV stand, and a Magiker unit with doors.<br /><br />Those memories made her want to have sex so she went into the street and took the first boy she saw into her apartment...<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br /><br />One of those paragraphs is even taken from the book directly.
B00122TAQA|5.0|This is the best collection of songs from a seminal rock act, influencing generations of musicians.  Joy Division's other full length, Unknown Pleasures, is the only collection that comes close.  Be warned, the 'extra' tracks are fuzzy, live cuts.  But they are intersting background, and the core 9 tracks are classic.  Joy Division were far ahead of their time, they will send chills down your spine 30 years after the album was recorded.
1401216676|5.0|Alan Moore is the greatest comic book writer of all time. His portrayal of the Joker is dark, violent, and irrational. Bolland's illustrations bring the book to life and tell a narrative of their own. Read it once and you'll want more. read it again and you'll catch all the little things you missed the first time through. But you'll still want more.
B001UV4XWY|1.0|\\"The Box\\" had issues and promise as expressed in other reviews but I am puzzled as to one issue. Why was it always women that pressed the button? If this was a biblical reference to Eve taking the first bite it was not well thought out?
1904633307|5.0|Northanger Abbey is not usually considered to be Jane Austen's best work. However, I am liking it more and more. If you are inclined to try for greater appreciation, I suggest reading Richard Jenkyns' A Fine Brush on Ivory.[[ASIN:0199210993 A Fine Brush on Ivory: An Appreciation of Jane Austen]] But enough of that. This edition is lovely, small and beautifully made. It is easy to carry with you and comes with its own ribbon book mark. The red cloth binding makes it difficult to decide whether to remove the dust jacket or not. The edges of the lightweight pages are gilded. Very nice!
0545123267|4.0|Ahhh, young love in chilly hypnotic woods, what better premise for a girl and wolf to meet and become totally enchanted with one another.  When Grace was a little girl she was pulled of her swing by a group of hungry wolves, one of them however was entranced by her warm sugar like scent and her sparkling green eyes and saved her.  Years later she still feels the connection. An incident involving someone from her school getting hurt brings upon men with guns, one of them hits the grey wolf, her wolf, the body falls down and suddenly changes into a human boy right in front of Grace's eyes. Their worlds will never be the same.    Grace is seventeen but feels like she's gliding through her life, day after day as if in a daze. All that changes when she finally discovers someone from her past that has come into her life in a big way. Sam casts a spell on her heart and brings her into the enchanted dark world of wolf-men with many secrets she's never been privy to.  As they fall in love, obstacles stand in their way endangering the fresh new relationship on all sorts of levers. The wolf pack and the human friends are entangled upon a mystery that has been a secret, those new to it will either try to betray or score more power with it. It's up to Grace to help save Sam and her friends without dying herself.    I really enjoyed this story; the pages themselves seemed to be coated in magical blue ink that changed the color, constantly making me think I have imagined it happening at all. The characters were endearing and passionate enough to get the book going, and it was nice to see more mature teenagers, but I agree that a little more parental supervision would have been more realistic, Grace had it way to easy, I would have never gotten away with what she did, haha. The novel was warm and special and it has a beautiful little spark to it, I highly recommend it as I'm looking forward to next part, \\"Linger\\" which seems to be happening in the spring- judging from the green cover.  The only minor complaint is that the book seemed to run a little out of steam by the middle, and some parts felt a little stiff and robotic, but overall I look back at it fondly and with nice memories. I read \\"Shiver\\" because I heard that it was being made into a movie, so that I could have known the story before I saw it, and in the process the book became more important than the movie, which is really cool. I don't usually read a lot of young adult fiction but this was some good stuff that I would have definitely engulfed if I was a teen.    -  Kasia S.

My only complaint is that the chapters are numbered continuously instead of preserving the distinct volumes and the chapter numbering within each volume. But then, this is the modern way.
B000026HWR|4.0|Terry Callier's music is subtle, and takes a few listens to make its full impact.<br /><br />But that is an asset. You would think soul and folk are antithetical, but Callier's arrangements are like orchestrated folk, yet he sings like a soul singer. Play this a few times, and more secrets reveal themselves.  When he incorporates Spectoresqiue production, it adds explosive charges to this already dynamite music.<br /><br />Completely worth warming to.
B0027BOL4G|2.0|The documentary is amazing. I had to return the product, however due to the inability to play the DVD more than once. I tried on several players and it would not read.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|This movie is much like Blair Witch in that you keep waiting for something to happen and it never does. The two endings were the only thing good about it, if you could stay awake long enough to see them.  Two currently over used words that irritate me are AWESOME and HITCHCOCKIAN.  This movie is neither.
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is on my personal Top 5 list...The story, the acting, the soundtrack are all fantastic.  It is truly a timeless film that deserves the accolades it got in 1997 and still receives today.  Despite it being early in their careers, it is some of the best work ever done by Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law.  They are so believable and integrated in their roles.  I've yet to have anyone I know watch Gattaca, and say it wasn't a great film.  Very highly recommended.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|If you want to be an informed about what we are eating WATCH THIS. It is enlightning and scary.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|This is my first Michael Buble cd. I decided to purchase after hearing \\"haven't met you yet\\" which I really like. The cd is good. Nice to put on after getting out of work to relax. Nice to hear a modern day \\"Frank Sinatra\\" in today's music!
6301647734|2.0|Harvey, 1950 film<br /><br />The film begins at the 19th century mansion of the Dowd family. Elwood P. Dowd gets a telegram, he acts strange in talking to an invisible being. He is the sole heir to the family fortune. [An argument for the Law of Division.] The manners of that time are shown. \\"The Doctor will see you in a minute.\\" There is a scene in a bar. A buxom singer entertains at the Dowd parlor. Aunt Ethel learns about \\"Harvey\\". She leaves, and so do all of her guests. Veta calls the Judge to take the needed steps. Dr. Sanderson the psychiatrist questions Veta about her brother (who visits cheap taverns). Mrs. Simmons tells him about Harvey. Who is the patient? Dr. Sanderson fears a lawsuit now! There is a conversation at cross purposes (a comedy of manners). \\"He seemed like a reasonable sort of fellow.\\" Willy Chumley tries to straighten out the mess. What is a \\"Pookah\\"?<br /><br />Veta returns home a nervous wreck. She tells what happened to her at the Rest Home. They let Elwood go. Wilson arrives to search for Elwood. \\"Have you seen Harvey?\\" Judge Gaffney will sue. Dr. Sanderson, Nurse Kelly, and Wilson find Elwood in Charley's Bar. They have a discussion. Where is Dr. Chumley? Elwood tells what he does in the bars. He meets people, but they leave after being told about Harvey. A frightened Dr. Chumley returns to the Rest Home. There is a conversation, Chumley now believes in Harvey. Elwood now questions Chumley, a reversal of roles. Elwood is offered serum #977 to bring him back to reality. But he prefers his fantasy. \\"Don't be a fool.\\" The taxi driver tells what will happen after the treatment. Veta objects, so there will be a happy ending. Is it believable?<br /><br />This was based on a Pulitzer Prize winning stage play. Was it changed for Hollywood? What does this say about popular tastes in the late 1940s? This is a story about a decaying family that is not as wealthy as the previous generation. Elwood, the main heir, does not have a job. He spends histime visiting bars and inviting strange men back to his home. His aunt Veta has his Power of Attorney and lives in the family mansion with her unmarried daughter. There seems to be no other relatives, or they avoid them. The author created a comedy from this sad situation. Was it based on a true event? Do films still treat psychiatry as a joke today? A person who talks to an invisible being may be suffering from schizophrenia. This also raises a philosophical question. Can anyone believe in something that most others deny exists?
B0034GK7DM|5.0|Great price, great new artist.  Real solid debut country album.  Not a bad song on this CD and he actually sounds a lot like a young George Strait - which is always a good thing.  If you like a classic country sound with some pedal steel guitar, which is lacking in any crappy Sugarland or pop star Taylor Swift song, then you will love this CD.  No pop country music on this one.
B000NHQLPS|5.0|The case on this two disc set is really nice. It is bluish great metal. I really enjoyed the special features and love the widescreen format. The only negative thing I can see is that inside it has a booklet but it has no information about the movie. It is just picture cards with Leonardo Dicaprio,Matt Damon and so on.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I thought this was so informational, I feel like everyone in America should watch this because they need to know about our food supply and how currupt it is.  It's so sad to see how poorly it is being handeled and what america is putting into there bodies thinking we are being healthy, shame on our Government for allowing all this to happen.  I would recomend this to all regradless of age, something needs to change with the way they handle our food and if enough people watch this and stand up that would be a start.  It made me so made at our Government not that I really needed another reason.  Correcting this problem would be a better plan than Obama's so called health care plan.
0812971825|2.0|A letdown after her first novel, which to me was a real page turner.  This book is VERY slow starting; I was half-way through and I really didn't know where it was going!  Very unsympathetic characters in the townspeople with Tyler's character not very clearly drawn, apart from his reglious beliefs, which he didn't seem to have a strong hold on.  I would have liked to know more about Lauren and her early life.  Not much better than an OK read, I'm afraid - won't keep you up nights.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This was by far the best movie going experience I had in my 25 yrs.  It was something new never before seen and loved every minute of it.  I watched this movie thrice in IMAX theater. The story was ok, has a lot of 'Dances With Wolves\\" themes but the visual graphics made the story more enjoyable.  Zoe Saldana did a fantastic job as a Naytiri. Great performances from all the actors. Great movie. I just hope James Cameron doesn't wait another 12 yrs before he makes a another movie. If you are the only few remaining people who hasn't seen this movie don't miss it. Highly Recommend this movie.
B00333NCTM|5.0|Im not much of an Ozzy fan but was somewhat interested in his tales. What a pleasant surprise! I laughed more then I can remember in recent memory over a book. All I can say is poor Sharon having to put up with all of his nightmareish nonsence. If you've ever wondered about the life of a rock star enjoy......

0446567337|3.0|This book bored me.  Maybe that is because I'm not fifteen.  I found it indulgent, obvious, and simple minded.  The only thing that really interested me was the relationship between John and his father and this is not really central to the story.  This book lacked in passion and depth.
B000FA675C|4.0|this book is great but it didn't fill the expectations that I hoped. I thought this lagged the thrill of finding the grail you have a century to find it it's not like its goinganywhere except that they moved it to france. The &#34;Angles and Demons&#34; was acually exciting because they actually had to find a bomb in this time period. I likethat Robert Langdon always get the young girls not the girls that arehisage it makes him seem more like a man. At the end of the story he always getss the girl or talks to a girl like Cane in CSI Miami it really makes me feel good becausethat older guy gets the younger girl. Thankyou for that because then you think is he going t get the girl then at the end he gets her and I'm like I knew it so it makes mefeel good and he always gets out of there. That is my review for &#34;Davinci Code.&#34; I always like getting the hot girls so I put myself inhis shoes because of her BB! That's what im talking about!!!!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I can't say I enjoyed this video because pretty much it was repulsive, I am thankful for the knowledge that I have gained where it pertains to my food though.  I have started already planning my natural garden for this year, and have sought out farmers in the area with chickens and rabbits.  I am definitely changing my eating habits and hopefully buying less form the store.    Thanks for creating this video, and Thanks Amazon for helping to distribute such great knowledge to the people.    Melanie Carter
0385504225|3.0|After the events of ANGELS AND DEMONS and the DaVINCI CODE Robert Langdon has returned to the quiet world of academia.  When a long time friend contacts him with a request to deliver a lecture for him in Washington DC Langdon is happy to oblige even though it is rather short notice.  Once he arrives in Washington though Langdon once again finds himself swept up in yet another desperate race through a famous city deciphering clues left on famous landmarks by their long dead architect.  This time the secret society behind all the action is that long time favorite of conspiracy theorists, the Masons.      If you like ANGELS AND DEMONS and/or the DaVINCI CODE you will probably also enjoy this latest novel although it is not quite on a par with the previous two.  Brown's style of short chapters filled with action and two or three threads of the plot occurring concurrently makes for an exciting read, even if a predictable one.  This is not a great novel that will become a classic but it is a fun way to spend a few hours.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|A greeting card copywriter Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) falls helplessly in love with beautiful Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Off-beat boy-meets-girl story is told in a chronologically non-linear fashion slightly reminiscent of \\"Annie Hall,\\" and despite the narrator's disclaimer at the beginning (\\"You should know up front, this is not a love story\\"), you will share the romantic ups and downs with the young protagonist Tom.    One thing unique about \\"(500) days of Summer\\" is that the bittersweet romantic tale is mostly told from a male's perspective. Director Marc Webb discards conventional narrative style of romantic comedy in favor of portraying motional turmoil of a young man terribly and utterly in love, using vignette like episodes. The film really works especially when it explores the way how men and women think differently. There are lots of things Tom must learn in these 500 days.    Besides the non-linear narrative, \\"(500) days of Summer\\" employs many interesting narrative devices. There is a brief split-screen sequence, in which two different scenarios unfold simultaneously: one that Tom is dreaming of, and the other Tom really must face. This is so true, and saddening. Maybe the film is sometimes too quirky for its own good, overusing a variety of narrative techniques (including dancing sequence) that almost distance the viewer from the main characters, but Tom and Summer remain likable, two main characters we really care.    Tom and Summer are played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. They both did a fantastic job, especially Zooey Deschanel. On screen she must look like a dream girl for Tom, and also a character with a touch of reality for us. Who wouldn't fall in love with her? And those who do will learn later that life is more complicated than it seems    Maybe it is too light for some viewers, and the content itself is nothing new, but \\"(500) days of Summer\\" is a refreshing experience.
0385532458|3.0|This book was different than the others. Short stories were all in the same town but at different times. I guess I prefer a more detailed, longer storyline. This was alright in some resects.

0596522347|5.0|I like to think that I do not suck at presentations. I like to think that I've thought reasonably hard about them. I like to think I've got a better understanding of presentations than most people.<br /><br />Then a book like Slide:ology comes out.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Suddenly I realize how much more there is to think about and how much more there is to learn.<br /><br />This is a deep book. From concept to final execution, from typesetting to data to missions to colour palettes, it's all in there. And all with a careful attention to craft and detail.<br /><br />I suspected it this book would be good, but this completely exceeded any expectations. Indeed, reading this book made me upset at how low my expectations were. It expands horizons, on par with books like Edward Tufte's The Visual Display of Quantitative Information or Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics.<br /><br />To say this book \\"raises the bar\\" would be unfair, because raising the bar doesn't catch how dramatically and substantially this book surpasses everything else. It's far beyond anything else that I've seen on the subject. Other books on presentations raised the bar. This one goes into high Earth orbit.<br /><br />I would love to see this book in a hardcover edition, perhaps with larger pages or larger text. Because I know this book is going to get re-read, referred to, handled, browsed, passed to students in my lab, and get beat up and worn out through constant use.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|It is well known that Martin Scorsese is a master filmmaker. Decade after decade he has continuously defied conventional formulas and provided artful films that explore all sides of the human condition. Granted, most of his films delve into the darker recesses of the human mind, and Shutter Island is no exception. It is a haunting experience, a film which uses both abstract and concrete techniques to tell a story. It may connect with mainstream audiences and it may not - but this much is true: in a society where Avatar can gross over six hundred million dollars and receive a nomination for BEST PICTURE of the YEAR, Shutter Island is a welcome luxury. It's like a drink of cool water after a particularly dehydrating hike in a desert abounding with the sort of intellectually devoid effects- driven action films, inane romantic comedies, and manipulative tearjerkers which are transforming American audiences into mumbling, drooling philistines year after year.     Shutter Island is the rare type of film that is difficult to review, only because it contains many plot twists which are crucial to the fantastic finale. In an attempt to avoid unnecessary spoilers, a brief outline of the plot will be provided, followed by a technical and artistic critique of the film.    The film opens in 1954, as a lone ferry arrives on an island which is reminiscent of Alcatraz, only it is not a prison in the usual sense. Rather, it is the location of a prestigious mental institution which houses only the most threatening patients, most of which have been committed for murder. After the disappearance of a vastly disturbed female resident, two U.S. marshals are summoned and arrive on the site to investigate, and fall upon one shocking revelation after another.     This film is drenched in atmosphere from beginning to end. From the opening strains of György Ligeti's haunting chamber piece \\"Lontano\\", to the initial appearance of the island itself, there is no doubt - you \\"feel\\" this film. Oncethe mood settles in during the first few moments, it stays with you until the credits roll. Through this expertly crafted juxtaposition of atmosphere and musical selection, Shutter Island springs to life.     The performances are uniformly amazing. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another knockout performance as Teddy, one of the marshals assigned to the case. Like Robert DeNiro and Harvey Keitel before him, DiCaprio's acting sensibilities have captured the attention of Scorsese, who has continued to cast him in several notable roles over the past few years, the most significant of which is his role in The Departed. Through Scorsese's direction, DiCaprio has been able to grow as an actor, and the results of this partnership are clearly on display in Shutter Island. Mark Ruffalo plays Teddy's partner, Chuck. Ruffalo exudes the necessary amount of intensity required by his character, and is wholly convincing. Scorsese also manages to draw some fantastic performances out of screen legends, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow. These two men convey a palpable sense of dread throughout the film in varying degrees. Watching the two men work under Scorsese's sure-fire direction is worth the price of admission alone. Patricia Clarkson also appears and in a memorable supporting role, and the same can be said of Michelle Williams.    As far as the direction itself, if you want to see a master at work, look no further than this film. It is a marvel in all aspects. This is Scorsese in top form. This is a film that simply cannot be missed.     Rated R for disturbing violent content, language and brief nudity. 138 min.
B002XMGGJM|4.0|I had pretty low expectations for this movie after seeing it was written by Kurt Wimmer of Ultraviolet fame.  I enjoyed his first movie - Equilibrium a lot, but I thought that his efforts had gone downhill since there.  Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It's one of those movies where you want the bad guy to win.    As far as the quality of the blu-ray disc, I'd have to say that this is excellent.  The audio on it was amazing - blasting sound out of my rear speakers that I was not expecting quite frequently.  The picture quality was also top notch.    Definitely glad I purchased it.
B002VECM6S|4.0|If you know me well, you know that I hate football. Heck, I loathe sports in general. So you can imagine how I felt when the family unit suggested that we see THE BLIND SIDE for our annual Christmas movie night. In a way, I was curious. I mean, Sandra Bullock isn't a bad actress, and her performance in this film has been all the rage lately, so there was at least one draw for me...just one. I hate inspirational sports films. I struggled through REMEMBER THE TITANS. I barely survived all 116 minutes of RUDY. We'll just say that this was not a film that I had anticipated.    And for all of my reservations, it was pretty good.    See this film for Sandra Bullock's amazing performance. It is a career best, and should not be missed. She lights up the screen, playing one of the most positive Christian characters ever seen in a mainstream Hollywood film. You only ever see slanted portrayals of Christians onscreen - and no wonder - if more Christians would walk the walk and talk the talk, this would not be a problem - however, Bullock gives a performance that dismisses all of that for now, especially given the fact that we are dealing with material that is based on real situations.    The film tells the true story of All American football player, Michael Oher, and the family that took him off of the streets of Memphis and adopted him. Bullock portrays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a devout Christian woman who convinces her husband to take a chance on the young black man. Being that she is a strong willed woman with a sharp tongue and a no-nonsense attitude, it's not long before shes purchasing a bed set and escorting Oher to the store to buy new clothes. She soon adopts maternal feelings for the boy, and becomes his legal guardian. She loves him just as if he is one of her own children. Michael looks after the younger kids and takes care of them, and Tuohy's youngest son becomes a permanent fixture at his side. Bullock's performance is the driving force behind the film. Her craft is impeccable. It's too bad that the film falls short dramatically at times, often resorting to Disney-esque sentiment while it abandons the harsher realities of life in favor of a family friendly PG-13 rating. Some of the minor characters come off as token caricatures, such as Kathy Bates' tutor and Michael's younger brother.    Weaknesses aside, while this may not be the best film of the year, it is definitely a touching story that tries its best to keep away from the temptation to manipulate the audience emotionally - and it is because of this film that I have a renewed faith in Sandra Bullock's abilities. See it for her performance alone, if you must. The other actors aren't bad. Tim McGraw is exceptional as Tuohy's supportive, submissive husband. Then again, he has nothing on Bullock. She steals the show.    A note to \\"Christian filmmakers\\" in the industry: take a lesson from THE BLIND SIDE. Here is a film that promotes Christian themes while avoiding the mistake of cramming a sermon down your throat. Remember, when it comes to film, we'd much rather hear a story than a sermon. If we want to hear the latter, we can go to church on Sunday. Remember, story over sermon. Anything other than that becomes propaganda. You lose 90% of your audience that way. Well, at least I start tuning you out, but that's just me.
B000063UR2|5.0|It is the only movie that I have seen where I view the Theater Cut to be better than the Director's Cut.  The Theater version gives a fantastic view of a mystical setting.  The Director's cut seems to go for a more serious and down to earth view which kills the fantasy.  The actors talk about how they like the Director's cut but to me the extra lines and lack of wonder makes the Theater cut a far superior version.      \\"Darkness was banished from the land by light and finally decided to act.  He and his minions used a couple of innocent lovers in his attempt to banish light forever.  The hero then steams up with the last band of able creatures to stop Darkness from banishing light but in the end Darkness can never be totally destroyed.\\"    The ultimate edition does give you the choice which is something that should be noted when considering the price.  It is two movies with all the extras included.
B00337KM2S|5.0|Director Jason Reitman, the director of Juno, has given us one of the best films of the year with Up In The Air, a superb character study about the meaning of life. Both heartbreaking and hilarious, this is a culturally relevant and timely film that is not easily forgotten.    George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man who fires people for a living. He basically executes what the big bosses are too timid to carry out themselves, and he has it down to a science. On the side, he is a motivational speaker who encourages his listeners to get rid of the excess baggage in their lives, in an effort to reach their personal goals and make their dreams a reality. The only problem is that Ryan does not have much of a life to speak of. He lives out of his suitcase, and has distanced himself from his friends and family, and has given himself over to casual relationships instead. His personal goal is to reach ten million frequent flier miles, and he is almost there. On one particular business trip, he meets and becomes close with a fellow frequent flier named Alex. They instantly hit it off, and begin an affair.    Meanwhile, back at the company offices, Ryan meets his new colleague, Natalie Keener. She is young, headstrong, and ultimately determined to work her way up in the business. Ryan feels threatened by the young lady, and insists that she is too naïve to carry out the demands of the job. It is at this moment that the boss suggests that Ryan take Natalie along with him on his travels to show her the ropes. She goes along with Ryan, and sits beside him as he brings in numerous unsuspecting individuals, and informs them that their jobs have been terminated. He asks each individual to see the situation in a positive light. It's not a termination so much as it is an opportunity to begin again. Ryan is a master of persuasion, and some people step away with a hopeful outlook. Others break down in shock - angry, frustrated, and confused. After a particularly disturbing encounter,Natalie begins to examine her position from an ethical standpoint. Of course, Ryan is there to soften the blow, as he tries to put things into perspective for her, with ambiguous results. Natalie returns to the main office, where she formulates a system that will allow her to fire people via the internet, rather than having to do it face to face.    Alex meets up with Ryan shortly thereafter, and their relationship grows from casual to something a bit more serious. Ryan invites Alex to his sister's wedding, and she accompanies him. It is during this time that Ryan's journey really begins. Will he remain an avid frequent flier, living in isolation, bouncing from hotel room to hotel room, or will he grab hold of the life that he has left and find true meaning? This is the existential dilemma that drives the film.    The performances are excellent all around. George Clooney plays Ryan, and totally becomes the character. This is his best performance in years. It's Clooney as you have never seen him before. Vera Farmiga plays his love interest, Alex.  She may receive an Oscar nomination for her work here. Anna Kendrick plays Natalie, and she is simply breathtaking. She has come a long way since Twilight.    Jason Reitman proves once again that he is a director to watch. This film is just as strong as Juno, and just as important.    Rated R for language and adult content.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|For years, my view of John Adams were he was one of our greatest presidents even though most \\"experts\\" disagreed. I knew the man was a genius and his positions were right for the nation. However, he lacked people's skills and weren't able to push his agendas successfully in Congress. The problem with Adams was he served between Washington and Jefferson-two giants who legacies have only grown despite many of their own faults. Adams, after over 200 years, is finally having the last laugh (thanks to this series).     This series does a great job in showing the man behind the presidency. The series also shows his shaky relationship with Jefferson and his part in the establishment of our nation. However, the best part of this series is it shows his relationship with his wife. She was truly his rock and his equal. Many people talk about Elenaor Roosevelt and Hillary Clinton changing the role of \\"First Lady\\" but I think Abigail Adams already did that.    Great and important series!! This is a MUST HAVE for all Americans and historians (big and small). John Adams died the same day of Jefferson on July 4th and he proclaimed \\"Jefferson lives\\". After this series, its time for us to proclaim \\"Adams live\\"!!
B002VECM4A|5.0|PRECIOUS is the most powerful film that I have seen this year. It is a film that I will never forget as long as I live. It is a film that pulls you deep in to hell and then, right when you least expect it, pulls you out of the abyss to show you the light. It is the story of a young black woman - the miraculous Gabby Sidibe - who is morbidly obese, impoverished, pregnant with her second child, and the subject of much abuse and ridicule. Most of the abuse comes from her mother, who is content to emotionally tear down her daughter while living off of a welfare check. She is a monster, plain and simple. Hope comes in the form of higher education, as Precious scores into an advanced educational program at school and, unbeknownst to her mother, starts classes with her new teacher, Ms. Rain. There, she learns to read and write, and through the encouragement of her teacher, starts to keep a journal of her daily life. At the school, Precious develops friendships and starts to grow intellectually. Little do her classmates know about the abuse at home, and the fact that Precious is pregnant with her father's child. Despite everything, she is determined to better herself, and retains a hopeful spirit.    It is NOT a film for children. It is NOT a film for prudes. However, it is a film that most Christians should see. This is the real world, folks. This is the reality that many \\"Christian\\" films gloss over, or ignore entirely. This is a story of real pain and real hope. Most have criticized this film for being overly depressing. I didn't find it to be so. I came out of the film not knowing what to say, but I felt joy for the main character in the film, and I was happy for her.    The performances in this film are amazing all around. Mo'Nique makes you believe in the darker side of humanity, and her performance is horrifying. Deserves many nominations come awards season. It is sad that most of the Christian viewers have chosen not to focus on the films positive content, but on the alleged \\"gay agenda\\" that some believe the film promotes. This is hogwash, and couldn't be farther from the truth. Yes, there are two lesbian characters. Get over it. Such is life. Gays and lesbians walk amongst us, and it is our job to show them the love of Christ and, as artists, reflect the truth of the world by giving them a part in the worlds that we create. Aside from that pointless bit of controversy, the film is a milestone. What could have been a boring cliche is actually one of the most rewarding films of the year. By no means entertaining, it is a film that needs to be seen.    Graphic scenes of rape and pervasive language make this a hard-R film that is entirely inappropriate for children. Surprisingly, at the screening that I attended, five and six year olds were present.
B001TZQITM|4.0|Pros:<br />Quality bag<br />Well Padded<br />Small Size<br /><br />Cons:<br />Camcorders Only<br />Pouches are small<br />Thick Padding limits space<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />If your camcorder is the shape/size of a 12 oz can of pop, it will fit perfectly in this case with a few small accessories (like a charger and a few memory cards).  This bag is designed for a very specific group of digital camcorders.  It doesn't fit tape or DVD based camcorders well, or if you do use one they fill the entire bag with no room for cables or accessories like tapes/DVDs.<br /><br />Overall the bag is well built and looks nice.  It sports a rigid bottom shell, with nice yellow interior and accents on the case.  It offers thick padding in the pouches and interior of the bag.  The handle on top is sturdy, but the shoulder straps look a little flimsy, but adequate.  The zippers are smooth and don't catch.  It is a well made bag of very limited function.  Although you can put other devices in this bag, they don't fit well.  My SLR is way too big, and it is one of the smallest on the market, my point-and-shoots are way too small, my lenses for my SLR are too wide.  It fits camcorders.  The product page has misleading information for this item.  The card that comes with it states it is the SLDC 203 Camcorder Kit Bag.
B002DKGWSE|1.0|This is probably the most disgusting, vile, degrading piece of trash that I have ever had the displeasure to sit through in a theatre.     The material is based on Ingmar Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING. That film has strong spiritual undertones that justify the ugly scenes that we have to endure, so that we may see the bigger picture of redemption at the end. In the context of THE VIRGIN SPRING, the graphic nature of the rape is necessary. As it is presented in THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, it is nothing more than pure exploitation that ultimately does not lead to anything that would warrant such a scene. The overall effect of that disgusting, perverse, gratuitous rape scene pervades the rest of the film, and in the end there is no real pay off. Yes, we want the parents to have revenge. I was rooting for mom and dad all the way. However, it was only after that I had finished the film that I questioned everything that I had seen. Gone was the moral center that made THE VIRGIN SPRING such a powerful experience to sit through. In Bergman's film, God's grace and forgiveness intersect through the darkness. The film ends with a natural miracle. The film ends with forgiveness. This one does not. This one ends with a man's head exploding in a microwave.     What you have here is a film that rubs your face in murder and rape for forty minutes, so that it can come to a stupid conclusion such as that.     I stormed out of the theatre in a rage. DO NOT see this film. See THE VIRGIN SPRING instead.
0316044938|1.0|I thought the premise of this book had some promise, but I was very disappointed throughout. One of the worst books I have ever read. The writing style was tedious and the narrative often confusing. I despised the \\"reincarnation\\" scene in which Susie, who was brutally raped and murdered at age 14, has sex with an old boyfriend.  How did this book get published? Terrible.
B002VECLVO|5.0|A SINGLE MAN, the directorial debut of fashion designer Tom Ford, boasts one of the best performances of the year. It is a rich and involving character study that will be talked about for years to come, and has already garnered several major awards nominations this season.    This extraordinary period piece opens in San Francisco in the year of 1962. The threat of nuclear war hangs in the air, and people are fearful of what the future may bring.    George, a homosexual college professor, has just heard via telephone that his partner of sixteen years has been tragically killed in a car accident. Not only that, but George has found out six days after the fact. Only family will be invited to the funeral. Upon hearing this tragic news, George's life begins to crumble around him. In a fit of tears and agonizing emotional distress, George runs across the street to his best friend's house for comfort. Afterwards, he walks back home. As he sits alone in his room, contemplating his seemingly routine and ordinary life, George decides to commit suicide the following day.    The day begins just like it always does. George goes through the motions of his daily morning ritual with all of the dedication of an obsessive compulsive individual. He eats breakfast, takes a shower, and gets dressed for work. Once out the door, he begins to reflect on the past and the present. He fondly recalls the first meeting between he and his lover, how they seemed destined to be together forever, and thinks of how dreary his life has become without him. He enters the classroom, and the fervor with which he addresses his class on this particular day catches the attention of one of his students, the twenty-year-old Kenny. The two of them begin to form a bond, and despite George's desire to end his life prematurely, this newfound friendship gives George a breath of hope.    The performances are uniformly amazing. Colin Firth is mesmerizing as George. He crawls inside the skin of this character and brings him to vivid life in front of our eyes. We see the pain that George is experiencing. We read it on his face, and hear it in his voice. George is someone that we can sympathize with, because Colin Firth's dedication to the creation of this character is so powerful. Julianne Moore plays George's best friend, Charley. She is a woman who loves George dearly, and tries to help him through his loss as best she can. Moore crafts an eccentric character that is both selfish and undeniably comforting to Firth's George. Nicholas Hoult exudes a near-perfect balance of naïvete and world-weary angst as the young Kenny.    Also notable in this film is the cinematography. Each image is meticulously framed and placed on the screen, with an appropriate mix of lushly filmed black and white and colored segments. It is a beautiful film to behold. The film score by Abel Korzeniwoski is simply haunting, and perfectly captures the mood of the film. It brings the emotions to life, and stays with you even as the credits begin to roll at the films finale.    Tom Ford has created a small masterpiece. His directorial skills are top notch. He delicately strings together all of the elements of this film, creating a singular work of art.    Whatever your take on the films content or subject matter, there is no doubt that this is a complex, intellectually stimulating experience that you will never forget.    Rated R for some disturbing images and nudity/sexual content.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I love this CD! I have heard at least 4 songs on the radio from this CD so decided to give it a listen. Lady GaGa can really sing and the other songs I hadn't heard before were really catchy. I would recommend this CD to anyone who has heard only a couple of her songs but would like to hear more.
0811806405|5.0|While searching for information on building acoustic guitars, I found this title referenced so often that I had to order a copy.  While there are many ways to approach the different steps of building a nylon or steel string guitar, the authors of this book are very open that they are presenting the way that they have found works best for them, and they provide specific details concerning their choices.    Rather than using elaborate (and expensive) body molds for shaping the sides of the guitar, this book advocates \\"free\\" building, using a guitar-shaped work table for construction rather than a form that constricts the sides into shape.  If you watch the YouTube videos of Steve Dickie building a guitar, you will see this method of building.    I'm impressed with the level of detail provided while still covering the very basic knowledge that a new builder may need.  Both steel string and nylon string building techniques are covered, and they are clearly notated as to which is which.  If I could only own one book on building an acoustic guitar, this would easily be the one.
B002WY65VU|1.0|This is a boring film, with little humor. It is just an attempt to re-hash all of the other zombie films, and yet falls way too short of the goal.  There was not a new idea in the whole thing. I really can't imagine why people have been giving this a high rating. Really.
0446567337|4.0|Dear John was the perfect romantic read, it's a bittersweet love story. I *sighed* while reading and found myself saying \\"awwwwww\\" several times. Yes, it was kind of sappy, but hey, sometimes you're in the mood for a good, sappy love story.<br /><br />Set in modern day North Carolina, John and Savannah meet while he is on military leave for two weeks during the summer. John is a reformed bad boy, who was raised by his father and joined the army shortly after high school. Savannah is a good girl/college student. The two are opposites, yet are drawn into each other from the start. They fall in love during the short time they have together, and when John has to go back to Germany for a year, they promise to wait for each other. John and Savannah write letters to each other while they are apart and after the year is over, the two reunite and they are both still in love. But as they are forced to be apart for longer than expected, their love is tested and they begin to grow apart.<br /><br />The book is narrated by John, and you get to see how much he does love Savannah. I really like John's character. He was loyal, kind and caring. Savannah irritated me just a bit. I think it's because she seemed childish at times, and as the two would have arguments, I found her annoying. All in all, I truly enjoyed this book and will read more Nicholas Sparks. I enjoyed the writing and the storyline.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Great movie. Very educational and no beating around the bush! I have lent this out to numerous people and have now changed the way they look and shop for food. Thanks for the great insight.
0743298039|1.0|http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&asin=0743298039&store=#     In conclusion of what I had read in pages 13-56.  I thought the book very hard to follow along with and author was all over the place.  I felt the book not to be very interesting.  I had hard time to continue to keep reading. I felt this was one of worst books  I have read.  I found the character Margaret to be as strange as author.  I would not recommend this book to anyone to read.  I give this book maybe a 2.  I had very hard time writing this paper since I found this book really bad.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|While I watched this completely engaging film noir, I kept seeing Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford in \\"Momma Dearest,\\" although the tables are turned in this film. In this instance, unlike in the Crawford bio, the mother Mildred Pierce is pretty much at the mercy of her spoiled daughter Veda. I cannot remember a more despicable daughter-- or son for that matter-- in any book or movie. Based on the novel by James C. Cain-- his works translate very well to the screen (for example, \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\")-- this movie has enough twists and turns for the most discriminating viewer-- as the detectives attempt to solve the murder of Mildred Pierce's husband. We should know for certain, however, that Mildred is not the killer since as her husband falls at the very beginning of the movie, his last word is \\"Mildred.\\"<br /><br />Crawford never looked better although I suspect she is pretty much playing herself although she did get a best actress Oscar for her performance. When Mildred is reduced to getting a job as a waitress, her makeup doesn't run and I suspect she is wearing heels as she rushes from table to kitchen but we'll just engage in our willful suspension of disbelief and enjoy the show.<br /><br />I was reminded once again that the really good movies entertain. \\"Mildred Pierce\\" certainly does.
0446567337|5.0|I just loved this book. What an enjoyable read. The ending was not what I would have preferred, but it was done so well, that I was okay with it, and even in agreement. I enjoyed it and will read it again.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This was a gift for my son who is in the military.  He LOVES this series!
0439023491|5.0|I picked this one up with the intention of reading it when I had time. Well, I couldn't put it down. Loved every part of it. Very creative book!
1400049628|4.0|Fun read.  Quick and easy.  The survival guide portion of the book gets a bit tedious but i understand the authors intentions.  I have seen these guides in various forms in my local subversive book stores, and i can happily say i will never have to read one.  The book takes off in the last chapters with the case studies.  Apparently this is where WWZ starts?  Whatever, grab it if your fascinated by the prospect of a zombie apocalypse.
B001OQCV2O|1.0|This movie is just terrible, it tends to jump all over the place having difficulty maintaining a specific plot.    The special effects were really good but overall this movie was a disappointment.
B00003CX9E|5.0|The greatest film ever made? That's debatable. It's debatable whether or not CITIZEN KANE is even Orson Welles' greatest film since TOUCH OF EVIL is regarded by many of the director's devotees as being better. Logically then, that would have to make TOUCH OF EVIL the greatest film ever made.<br /><br />Actually, no single film has a right to such a designation as being the greatest. Every movie is limited by its genre and the specific story it proposes to tell. Different films have different things to say and many diverse ways of saying them. One genre - be it drama, horror, comedy, musical, etc. - is not above another. There are outstanding films of every type. Having said that, CITIZEN KANE is definitely one of the greatest films of its genre and of all time, and the influence it had on motion pictures is undeniable. However, many of the techniques accredited to it as being \\"firsts\\" have been used in movies well before KANE. Devices like flashbacks, overlapping dialogue, visible ceilings - these things weren't introduced in KANE as it's often cited. The difference was that Welles put them all together in one film to create a cinematic synthesis, like a magician's bag of tricks opened up to dazzle and enthrall the spectator. This comes as no surprise given the fact that Welles himself liked to dabble in magic and the art of illusion. One implausibility in the script was overlooked: When Kane whispers \\"Rosebud\\" on his deathbed no one is around to hear him, so how does everyone in the film know it was the last thing he said? The fact that we're willing to dismiss or not even notice this rather major oversight is a tribute to how the film's magic spell affects us.<br /><br />Kept in proper perspective, CITIZEN KANE is still a powerful work, its vivid imagery lingers in our memory and its message - \\"of what profit is it to a man if he gains the world but forfeits his soul?\\" - remains as potent as ever. Warner's special edition does ample justice to Welles' most discussed film.<br /><br />My highest recommendation.
B001TD1XWG|1.0|I really like the Hot Revolver track but other than that this album is really just...painful.  Wayne should stick to what made the Carter II and III great.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I had forgotton some of my favorite MJ songs over the years and was suprised and saddened to think the end of this prodigy had come.      Michael's dancing ability was wonderful.  He was ready for the world to see again...and it is tragic this did not happen.      No matter how eccentric he was, his musical and dancing genius will live on forever through \\"This Is It\\".     See this video, or better yet, buy it.  It is a Collector's item - no matter how sad the aftermath was.  There will never be another Michael Jackson. He provided the soundtrack to my youth, as well as countless others.
B001E57SH8|1.0|This lighter lights up maybe 1 out of every 10 times I strike it, the flame rarely stays on for more than 3 seconds and I have been consuming flints like crazy. I have been using a standard, disposable, plastic butane lighter which is much more reliable and durable. Too bad for this product's great looks and finish, the rest is a waste of metal. I bought zippo premium butane gas and used it according to the instructions up to the letter but nothing made it work reliably. Total waste of good money.
B000000WIG|4.0|I like this CD a lot. I've had it for years and still enjoy listening to it every so often. I never noticed before but I was listening to this CD at work one day (through headphones) and noticed a familiar guitar sound on \\"The Blues is All Right\\". I was sure I heard Albert \\"The Iceman\\" Collins playing on this song (like most guitarists, he playing has a sound of its own). So I looked it up on Amazon and lo and behold, that IS Albert Collins playing on \\"The Blues is All Right\\".    I think this is a nice blues/rock CD. I really like Gary Moore's guitar style on this CD and find his style to be bluesy - nice bends, slides, wah pedals, etc. on the guitar that help give it the bluesy feel. I like the female background vocals on a lot of the songs, and I like the horns in the background. I don't feel that horns or background vocals takes away from the bluesy feel - B.B.Kind makes use of horns sometimes, as does Tommy Castro, Albert Collins, Roomful of Blues, etc. I personally like both slow blues and more rocking, upbeat blues. I don't think blues has to slow and sad music. BB King said on his \\"Live at San Quentin\\" CD, \\"most people think that the blues is supposed to make you feel sad. But Blues can be something to boogie on too\\".    Gary has technical talent in playing the guitar and I enjoy the energy and feel of the album. I'd have to agree, though, that his vocals are nothing special.
B002XUL6QC|4.0|\\"Lola Montes\\" was German director Max Orphuls' first film in color, first in Cinemascope, and his last film. Due to its terrible reception in Paris in 1955, the film was re-cut twice -once by Orphuls and once by the producers- in attempts to make it more palatable to audiences. It was the most expensive European film ever made when it was released, so it was a notable flop. The first attempt to restore the \\"Lola Montes\\" to its original cut was made in 1968 from an incomplete print. The version on Criterion Collection 2010 DVD is a complete restoration, completed under the leadership of La Cin&eacute;math&egrave;que française in 2008.<br /><br />This has long been a film appreciated more by filmmakers than by audiences. It appeals either to those who scrutinize its camerawork or who can place it in the context of film history or of Max Orphuls' work. That said, and although the film is technically interesting, I found it quite watchable. \\"Lola Montes\\" was the stage name of Elisabeth Rosanna Gilbert, a famed Spanish dancer, courtesan, and mistress of King Ludwig I of Bavaria in the 1840s. Orphuls reduces her to a circus attraction in middle age, taking impertinent questions from the audience and recreating her scandalous life on stage through absurd tableaux vivants and dangerous stunts.<br /><br />In fact, Lola Montes was never in a circus, and Orphuls hits the viewer over the head with his condemnation of exploitation and objectification, represented by Lola's (Martine Carol) circus act and its callous ringmaster (Peter Ustinov). I can't help but think this is at least partly responsible for the film's poor reception. As a rule, movies that scold, accuse, or condemn their own audiences are not popular. When Orphuls shames the audience of that circus, they are stand-ins for the film's audience. But the circus is something to see, as we watch Lola's adventures acted out by this bizarre company and in flashback as Lola recalls the events of her life.<br /><br />Martine Carol was not Max Orphuls' choice for the role, and she is wooden. That's appropriate in the circus scenes, less so in the flashbacks. I think the real Lola Montes must have had more personality, but since this is a film about spectacle, not drama, Carol's limited acting skills don't hinder its ambitions. It takes liberties with Lola Montes biography, but it wasn't intended to be a biopic. Although Orphuls undoubtedly meant for \\"Lola Montes\\" to comment on exploitation, it could just as easily be a comment on celebrity, which might be more timely in the 21st century. Lola Montes used celebrity, and it used her.

She discusses the film's history, composition, camerawork, making the film, its context in Orphuls oeuvre, and themes. On Disc 2, there is a 1965 episode of the French television program \\"Cin&eacute;astes de notre temps\\" (53 min) that features some of Orphuls collaborators. \\"Max by Marcel\\" (33 min) is a documentary by Marcel Orphuls about his father.

B001TODCII|4.0|Liam Neeson shares a trait that all great actors possess - they can do something completely ridiculous and remain entirely believable.  If you're watching Patrick Stewart play Jean-Luc Picard on \\"Star Trek - Next Generation,\\" you're watching an actual Star Fleet captain rather than a ham actor over-acting on a cheesy set.  If you're watching Sigourney Weaver in \\"Alien,\\" you're watching Ripley take on the universe's most dangerous monster rather than an actress dancing with a rubber suit.  If you're watching Meryl Streep in \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" you're watching an egotistical editor of a fashion magazine, not a drama queen emoting for effect.    From \\"Darkman\\" to \\"Star Wars\\" to \\"Taken,\\" Neeson has always remained believable and compelling no matter how ridiculous his surroundings or god-awful the dialogue.      In \\"Taken,\\" we have to believe that Bryan Mills (Neeson) is a lethal espionage/security guy, one of the best in the world, whose dedication to the job cost him his family.  Too late, he realized his error and quit so he can live in unemployed drudgery and snatch a few moments here and there with his cherished daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace).  Bryan's ex, Lenore (Famke Jannsen, in a thankless role), has custody of Kim and has remarried a sugar daddy who is actually a better person than Lenore.  Kim desperately pleads with Bryan to let her go to Paris with her friend Amanda to tour museums.  Bryan reluctantly consents, going against his better instincts that his 17-year old baby is going to a dangerous place and is not ready for it.    Unfortunately, Bryan is right - within minutes of landing in Paris, things go horribly, horribly wrong.  If you saw the trailer for \\"Taken,\\" you know that the movie is about Bryan's hunt for Kim across the Parisian underworld.     This is where \\"Taken\\" takes flight in a \\"Bourne Ultimatum\\" kind of way.  There is virtually no character development - the question is whose arm Bryan will break (or worse) as he hunts for his daughter,and how efficiently he'll do it.  Like Jason Bourne, Bryan Mills is not an acrobatic martial artist who will jump, twirl, and kick for dramatic effect - he'll rip your ears off and snap your legs with economic fury.  He's not doing it to be cool.  He's doing what he needs to do to get his daughter back.    Woe betide any man or woman who gets in his way.  \\"Taken\\" strings together a preposterous chain of events that could never happen in a gazillion years, but you won't have time to figure that out until after the movie is over.  For 90-odd minutes, you'll be taken on a compelling thrill ride, courtesy of Neeson and team.      Full disclosure - while this movie owes an obvious debt to the \\"Bourne\\" franchise as far as the feel and look of the film is concerned, it is considerably darker in both subject matter and tone.  This is far from a feel-good movie - you get the sense there are no winners here.

B002VKE1K2|3.0|Although successfully creepy, this film fell flat for me.  It was extremely slow to start, with at least 45 minutes before it approached interesting.  When it did take off, the encounters skipped interesting and went straight to disturbing.  Nicely realistic in that capacity, the end was terrible.  Any credibility it built up for having a realistic feel sold out to Hollywood in the last 10 seconds.

B002RSDW80|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  For those who haven't seen 'Julie and Julia', it's a tale of two gourmands, or gluttons depending on your perspective. There seems little doubt that 'Julie' is the weaker of the two stories as she is much lesser known compared to Julia Child, a seminal figure in the world of cookery. Julie's claim to fame was that she came up with the idea of preparing every meal featured in Julia Child's cookbook within a year's time and blogging about it over the internet. Some people describe her as a 'whiner' and certainly the use of various expletives in her blogs turned off a fair number of people (including Julia Child herself along with her original editor). Nonetheless, she did accrue a rather large following over the internet due to her witty style of writing. It's probably safe to say that Julie is more an innovator in the field of writing than cooking. Amy Adams does a fair enough job conveying the exuberance of the talented writer who is also a tad bit neurotic in her bid for public acceptance.<br /><br />  The 'Julia' side of the story is far more fascinating. First of all, the recreation of Paris in 1949 is vastly more visually arresting than the blas&eacute; Queens of 2002. Then there is Julia Child's story itself, which pulls you in from the start. I like how Nora Ephron didn't sugarcoat her protagonist--she could have omitted the fact that Julia Child was an avid smoker, but chose not to! Her early training at the French cooking school, replete with the conflict with an arrogant headmistress along with the distrust of her fellow male students, reveals just how determined Julia Child was to mold a career around cooking, an avocation which she absolutely adored. The jury is still out whether Meryl Streep captured the essence of the cooking icon. Some internet posters feel that her performance was all caricature but others were convinced that Streep conveyed Julia's warmth and humanity. I personally felt there was a little bit of both as Streep aimed for a mixture of verisimilitude and parody.<br /><br />  What keeps us interested in 'Julie and Julia' is not only the interconnected plot but our basic curiosity in seeing how both characters manage to become successful in their field. Before becoming successful, both Julie and Julia had to both deal with rejection. With Julie, her initial failure to attract an audience to her blogs, culminating in the failure of the elderly Judith Jones (Julia's editor) to show up at the dinner and interview with the accompanying Christian Science reporter, marks the low point in her quest for acceptance; similarly, Julia must also overcome obstacles including the dissonance over a writing partner's failure to make a sufficient contribution to the book the writing team has been working on as well as the initial rejection of the book by the well-known publishing house, Houghton Mifflin. And the scenes where Julie and Julia 'succeed' are probably the most satisfying of the entire movie: in Julie's case, she receives multiple messages on her answering machine; for Julia, it's the moment she opens the letter from another big publishing house, Alfred Knopf, who finally has accepted her manuscript.<br /><br />  Both Julie and Julia both have supportive husbands who figure prominently in the story. Again, the story of Julia's husband, Paul Child (ably played by Stanley Tucci) is more interesting than the story of Julie's husband, Eric. With Julie and Eric, there's a direct conflict between the couple, culminating in a fight where they stop talking to each other for a short period of time. The conflict helps to flesh out Julie's character a bit since it is Eric who accuses her of being narcissistic (not entirely without merit). But the conflict is basically standard domestic discord type of stuff. The conflict between Paul and Julia stems from Paul's situation as an employee of the U.S. Foreign Service. There is always the fear that Paul will be transferred which might throw a wrench into Julia's career aspirations. Somehow, she is accommodating and they manage to work things out.<br /><br />  However, there is the larger conflict of the U.S. Government versus Paul. He's called home and investigated by higher-ups who are minions of Joe McCarthy. Somehow he manages to escape being blacklisted. Some internet posters object to Nora Ephron's liberal bias, especially in her disparagement of McCarthy sympathizers. I can only laugh at the thought that there are people who actually believe that Joe McCarthy kept America 'safe from Communism'. As someone who has read numerous biographies of Joe McCarthy, I am completely convinced that Joe McCarthy only used the issue of Communism to further his career. In fact, in 1949, McCarthy supported a group of SS men accused of murdering US Soldiers during World War II. This was his first battle with the Army; in 1954, he tried to take on the Army again during the 'Army-McCarthy' hearings, and lost.<br /><br />  Once we learn of how the two principals break through with their initial success in their respective fields, 'Julie and Julia' runs out of gas. The closing credits inform the audience of the fate of the real-life Julie and Julia. The disturbing rejection of Julie by Julia Child (as well as Julia's editor) is mentioned, but never explored.<br /><br />  As someone who hasn't eaten meat or poultry for thirty-five years and gave up butter and cheese about ten years ago, somehow I was not impressed by the 'eat everything you can' philosophy promoted by the film's scenarists. Perhaps in Julia Child's day it was safer to eat the food she was eating since the animals were not fed the cheap grain and shot full of hormones and antibiotics as they are today.

0547258305|2.0|I just finished this book so this review is like my first impression.  I actually read it based on a very positive review from someone who usually has more common sense, so I almost expected a mind-blowing novel. Instead, as I went through the whole thing, I found myself more and more disappointed and hoped it would improve before the end, but it didn't (spoilers ahead).     I didn't give it only one star for the simple reason that the author put some effort into the accuracy of descriptions such as crossing a mountain (I've seen characters crossing frozen mountains without any sort of equipment and coming out as fresh as if they had taken a stroll in the park), and also because this book is still better than some very popular romance novels. At least Katsa has some other goals in life than dedicating it to a man, and Po tries not to be too possessive or controlling.    Still we are being served another version of Mary Sue and Gary Stu. Katsa seemed to be an interesting character at first, but then she succeeds in almost everything she does: she created the Council all by herself, is described as invincible since she can survive everywhere, she teaches people to fight, etc... That's quite a lot for only one person. Why not leave a bit more credit to the others?   As for her views on certain things such as marriage, I would have expected her to at least reconsider her position by the end of the book.   The main character's love interest has everything, the good looks, a good heritage, a Grace that allows him to have a good ending no matter what and a more than remarkable dedication to Katsa, which also makes him almost perfect. The rest of the characters are just cardboard characters, with of course the \\"good peasants\\" and the \\"evil kings\\". Let's not talk about the main villain, with the eternal evil-king-hurts- children-and-puppies cliché.     The world building is less than elaborate: I haven't seen any sign of religion, culture is kept to its minimum, everyone speaks the same language and politics are really simple. More than once I felt the characters were just modern people transposed into \\"another\\" world, if I may say so, because this world seems to enjoy everything from modern technologies (incredibly clean streets, white and gleaming marble even though they obviously heat the rooms with wood fire, the characters sometimes taking two hot baths in a row!!). This is nothing like \\"medieval\\" times.     Then, we are told that people fear the Gracelings but most of them seem to act normal around them.   The idea of the Graces was good and could really have been developed to make a great novel, not necessarily a romance. I would have been really interested to see the racism toward them, see how they would struggle to integrate, maybe see them regroup to rebel. But here there are very few consequences. After it is revealed their evil King was a Graceling, I would expect people to fear them even more, and even decide to eradicate them. That would be something to elaborate (maybe in a sequel?). I have to admit I was quite disappointed by the very happy ending and the absence of consistent plot, where everything is solved very quickly by only a handful of persons (why did no one else think of that before?). There is little showing, mostly telling, which I must admit makes the pace go faster but doesn't leave much to the reader's imagination.     I wished the author put more energy into world-building because, yes, a world where such people as Gracelings exist could be worthy of interest. Otherwise, the story could as well have been transposed to our world, if world building was too much trouble for the author.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I first saw a preview of this movie on the Apple website & have been looking forward to seeing it ever since!  It certainly didn't disappoint!  A lovely story of a mother who sees a child in need & welcomes him into her home & family without thought or pretense. Watching him rise above aversity & shine.  Quniton Aaron is great as Michael, Sandra is terrific as always as Leigh-Anne with Tim McGraw as a light foil as her husband Sean.  Then we have Kathy Bates as Miss Sue, Michael's tutor( someone who's spiritual but with doubts & a Democrat). Lastly the Tuoeys children - Collins & S.J., played by Lily Collins & Jae Head respectively.  S.J. is priceless, adding a lot of light humour to the situation. All the cast put in terrific performances, each working off each other effortlessly.      Then the bonus, seeing various images of the real Michael Oher, the Tuoeys & Miss Sue.      If you're looking for a moving, light-hearted and inspirational family film - this is one I would highly recommend you check out.

0316044938|4.0|When I began to read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" I expected to find a literary take on the serial killer novel plus, perhaps, a police procedural along with the story of the murdered victim's family members and their reaction to the heinous crime that has so impacted their lives. Well, I was wrong. \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is so much more than this. Yes, the story includes all of the above - but it is primarily about a murder and its aftermath, narrated by the murder victim herself, a teenage girl, from her roost in a gazebo in the clouds  - \\"the blue, blue Inbetween,\\" a sort of way station before she passes on to the place she calls the \\"wide, wide Heaven.\\" This beautifully written and originally conceived narrative haunted me long after I turned the last page.<br /><br />\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is no whodunit, however, as the killer is reveled in chapter one along with the description of the crime.<br /><br />Our narrator introduces herself in the first paragraph: ''My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie...I was 14 when I was murdered on Dec. 6, 1973. In newspaper photos of missing girls from the 70's, most looked like me: white girls with mousy brown hair. This was before kids of all races and genders started appearing on milk cartons or in the daily mail. It was still back when people believed things like that didn't happen.\\"<br /><br />Susie cannot move on to Heaven because she cannot let go of her loved ones and the life she left behind. She longs, wistfully, for something she misses from earth. She is a \\"watcher\\", and lives vicariously by observing and commenting on the world where she no longer exists. She can see and hear her loved ones, know what they are doing, thinking, and feeling, but she cannot be with them, nor they with her. Susie believes that: \\"if I watched closely, and desired, I might change the lives of those I loved on earth.\\" And, I might add, help her father and the police apprehend her killer.<br /><br />She discovers there's not one heaven; there's her heaven, other heavens and \\"heavens where a girl like me didn't fit in,\\" where \\"life is a perpetual yesterday.\\" There are no angels here, only \\"intake counselors\\" to advise new arrivals.<br /><br />Of course, she has her own intake counselor in the Inbetween and a roommate also. Her counselor advises her, \\"If you stop asking why you were killed instead of someone else, stop investigating the vacuum left by your loss, stop wondering what everyone left on Earth is feeling, you can be free. Simply put, you have to give up on Earth.\\"<br /><br />She describes, so poignantly, the horror and grief her family experiences at her loss. The relationship between her father and mother deteriorates significantly as they are unable to cope with life \\"afterward.\\" And of course her brother and sister have their own demons to deal with as their lives continue after their much loved Susie's has been snuffed out. Once the horror and shock of the murder wanes, her family slowly begins to fall apart and she is powerless to help.<br /><br />Susie has the gift of omniscience and sees many others from her perch beyond the clouds: her sister Lindsey and Lindsey's boyfriend, and watches as their relationship develops, sharing their joy while yearning for what might have been for herself; her killer, calm, cool and collected, as he continues to murder innocents; her friend Ruth, the last person her soul touched as it left Earth; and Ray, the boy who \\"almost kissed her\\" - her \\"might have been boyfriend.\\"<br /><br />The author spins a tale that spans years of earthly and \\"almost heavenly\\" life. She moves back and forth in time and place to and ending that is at once joyous, exhilarating, and heartbreaking.<br /><br />There are places in the book where Ms. Sebold becomes too dramatic and her narrative over-the-top unbelievable. These lapses do not diminish her ability to mesmerize the reader with her lyrical prose and compelling narrative that never fails to capture the imagination.<br /><br />As an aside - I find it interesting that the author's first book, \\"Lucky,\\" is a nonfiction haunting account of the author's rape at age 18.<br />Jana Perskieook, \\"Lucky,\\" is a nonfiction haunting account of the author's rape at age 18.

I found the world of Katsa and Po to my liking. The idea of Graces sat firmly in my love for X-Men comics as well. A good novel that splits the action and adventure with tender scenes that can even be relatable to current times in the sense of no one loves to leave someone behind. The ending was a bit of a twist for me and that is the only reason I dont give it five stars. This book has been left with an opening for a sequal but hasn't received it. I truly hope the author takes another foray into the world of the Seven Kingdoms!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I read this book purely for entertainment purposes, and I was mildly entertained.  Sure the story is somewhat like the others (I knew it would be), and my only complaint was that the book was too long. Seems to me that the book could be cut in half if the CIA director had told the truth from the beginning, but I'm not one to make much of a stink over the actions of fictional characters.    There was, this time, a little twist that I wasn't expecting and found myself reading with my jaw hanging wide open and over what special kind of crazy the villain was and wondering what was going to happen next, but that was near the end of the book and it took too long to get there.      Still, if I had the choice between 'buy this book' or 'borrow it from the library', this would be a 'borrow'.

B002YIHO7I|4.0|At first, I wasn't as pleased as I had expected.  I loved \\"Soldier of Love\\" when I first heard it on the radio, so I was anxious about the album's release.  I pre-ordered with Amazon and received it fairly quickly.  It took a second, and a third listen, in order for me to give it a thumbs up.  I was expecting more of that sultry , jazzy, horn-section music I'm use to hearing from the band, but I didn't get that this time.  I'm completely satisfied with Sade's part in the album, but I have to admit, I am a little disappointed with the music.  It's still worth a purchase though because there is no one who can bring it to you like Sade.

I do not expect everyone who reads this to make such a drastic change but I do think that it is worth the read. Beware though there are some sections that seem  long, boring, and somewhat repetitive.

And, what if little incidents such as these and a lot worse were part of a big plan with some not-entirely-human, cyber entity in control and with no one able to figure out what 'the plan' was or even whether such a plan even existed?<br /><br />Somewhere, half-way between [[ASIN:B000P0J0AQ The Matrix]] and Orwell's [[ASIN:0451524934 1984]], 'Daemon' is a collection of snapshots and short plays of a possible, quite plausible and, in the author's view, almost inevitable future, sequentially presented to map the slow but unstoppable rise of a powerful entity. A computer genius dies and leaves behind some fault tolerant, distributed, highly redundant, impossible to kill cyber being that gradually takes control over corporate and government networks and begins to control some of the key people who operate them and appears to pursue some end-state - only no one can fully understand what it is. It's a power grab and, predictably, those who claim the right to hold and exercise power react.<br /><br />Daemon wants to be an extra-lucid vision of what may soon come to be if the technological and societal agents now in play instead of continuing their current meandering are channeled so that 'something' - we don't know for sure what but there are hints - can be accomplished with some degree of efficiency. While specific interactions are meticulously described to the level of specific button pushes and mouse clicks,  'Daemon' is a story lacking an over-complicated plot - chapters are more like snapshots, only loosely connected: murders, havoc, covert or overt struggle, news and public opinion manipulation, NSA/CIA/FBI/etc. meetings - whose characters take brief turns onto the stage, say their lines only to fade away maybe to be reused a few chapters later, unless completely killed. There isn't a lot of introspection - characters are sketched in a hurry, act and then leave, making room for the next number and so are the landscapes of a dying world and social order or rather of a world order dominated by greedy corporations led by undeserving potentates.<br /><br />Suarez starts from a few premises or assumptions to construct a possible future. Conflict between those who develop empowering technologies and those who actually hold power is inevitable with the impotent and clueless multitudes watching passively, helplessly and inconsequentially. The State is nothing but a manifestation of the corporations it violently protects or promotes. Soon, the distinctions between the virtual worlds our computers run for our entertainment and what we call 'reality' are going to blur and simply advancing today's technologies for a few more years would make reality increasingly more difficult to distinguish from virtual spaces or 'maps'. Daemon shows what appears to be the beginning of a new era - times and places where real people are pawns and occasionally (minor) actors in a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) where a dead genius set new rules because he could. And, as we turn the pages, it becomes increasingly clear that it doesn't matter much which side wins any particular round or even the overall game/struggle/war. According to the Daemon, an artificial intelligence bent on world domination but whose ultimate goal can be only guessed, the real world of humans does not have much of a future going where it's going now. Knowledge, wealth, power - it's the old rock/paper/scissors game only, in Daemon,those who control 'knowledge' or maybe more accurately 'technological know-how' decide to claim the upper hand, or so this first of the 2-volume story appears to suggest. And they do so by focusing virtual cyberspace resources to the point where they break into the 'real' world and begin to shape it and control it almost at will. And, like your friendly government would also claim, it's probably done for our/your own collective good and safety or at least to prevent an even greater evil from taking over.<br /><br />This is where Daemon ends and I'm looking forward to reading Freedom now. There's no Hollywood happy ending in 'Daemon' because no one is ever happy or even smiling - most of the plot is driven by a non-human entity and most humans actions are tightly controlled, playing their part - either Daemon's physical extensions under its complete control or super-secret government agents doing what they're told - so why would anyone ever smile? In spite of the lack of characters, the linear plot - the Daemon grows increasingly more powerful - and of only hints as of where this is going, this is a captivating read. It all starts slowly, with the author oh-so-eager to show off his mastery of 'computer lingo' but also because he wants to help us understand that we are already half-way there when it comes to the enabling technologies that would make the Daemon or a Daemon-controlled world possible. As the story keeps pace, so to speak, the little puzzle pieces begin to arrange themselves, the pace of the action picks up and the technology lingo while still present and in abundance is less noticeable and less intimidating.<br /><br />Being somewhat familiar with the tech terms and acronyms, I may not be able to properly assess Daemon's readability by non-techies. '1984' was prophetic, readable and effective by simply hinting at the outlines of domination technologies and techniques that, even though have not come into existence EXACTLY the way Orwell imagined, his 'big picture' and vision are uncomfortably validated by today's realities. The Matrix needs little or no connection to 'reality' because it's nothing but a dream so everything is possible - high tech is nothing when compared to the kind of magic we can dream.  [[ASIN:0441012035 Neuromancer]] became a cult read BECAUSE Gibson imagined most of the technology and he did so before he had the chance to touch a computer (or so the story goes). So, the question is - could Daemon become quickly 'dated' in a world where computer tech continues to change if not evolve at a fast pace. I am afraid so but time will tell.<br /><br />For a 'first novel', Daemon is surprisingly good. I hope that non-techie, non-gamers will have the patience to read and appreciate this work as it comes from an enormously talented author who clearly has something and, hopefully, a lot to say about the world we live in.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;those who control 'knowledge' or maybe more accurately 'technological know-how' decide to claim the upper hand, or so this first of the 2-volume story appears to suggest.

Very informative, I knew almost nothing of cells or cancer, or the laws governing them. Very human, couragous family, shown warts and all. Hurray and thank you, Henrietta, alias Hela.
B001FB55I0|4.0|loved this movie.  this is one of those that'll stay in my collection.  cant wait for the next one.
B000UG78NG|5.0|I remember seeing this book several times in bookstores. I don't know what it was about it that made me keep it at arm's length, but that's what I did - until recently. This book popped up in my recommendation tab over and over again; it garnered great reviews, but still I feigned to keep away from it. Finally, after reading through a few books that were just \\"meh\\", I decided that I needed to give this book a chance, as it seemed to haunt me whenever I was in the market for a new read (which is very often). I'm so glad that I did.    What you get from this book is so beyond what is offered by many modern-day authors. If you read as many novels as I do, then you know what it's like to eat your way through multiple books and finish each feeling underwhelmed, like you had just finished eating an entire bag of Doritos instead of a full meal. To continue on my food analogy: this book is the fillet mignon of modern day fantasy reads. It is like the vintage bottled sauvignon to your boxed chiraz.  You will read it, you will live it, and you will love it.    The book's story centers on a mysterious man named Kvothe. It is the first part of the \\"King Killer Trilogy\\". Much of the story is written in the first person perspective (Kvothe's), while another portion is written in third-person objective. Kvothe's story will take you from the rural roads of Rothfuss' world, to its dingy city streets, musical venues, and finally to the Arcane University. This story has it all in spades: Action, adventure, romance, an interesting magic system, and a taste of the badass that Kvothe is to become.       Many a time during my first read did I find myself with tears welling in my eyes, adrenaline pumping through my veins, or a smile peeled across my face. it doesn't matter who you are, you should give this book a run. Pick it up and read it (or download it to your Kindle). I'm sorry that this review is so scattered; I have pressing things I need to do right now. I just wanted to log on andpraise this book as best I could.
B00275EGX8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, but after reading some quotes from actual soldiers that served in Iraq, I felt a bit cheated.  The movie centers around an Army EOD (bomb disposal)unit serving in Iraq.  You follow this unit in their everyday activities such as finding/disarming IED's and other bombs.  I commend the film makers for choosing to talk about these soldiers and how dangerous their jobs are.  The real soldiers out there doing this job are hero's in my mind. The film does a good job of showing how scary it is in Iraq and how danger can lurk in any window, alley or building.  What the film does badly though is portraying the leader of the EOD unit as a cowboy who breaks the rules and puts his team in unnecessary danger over and over again.  The character Sgt James is just not believable.  That just killed the \\"authentic\\" feel of the movie.  I'm not a soldier, but even I can figure out that an EOD unit would not just go off on it's own with no support, not telling anyone, and search for insurgents.  No way.  Sgt James going out alone in a hoodie to find some people?  Not. I also read that the characters were not wearing the correct uniforms in the movie.  I'm sure the producers wanted to \\"jazz\\" up the movie with some \\"drama\\", but why?  Is the life of one of these soldiers so \\"boring\\" that it had to be hammed up like that?  I think nonsense like that just takes away from the film.  What they did get right though, they did well.  The actors are terrific.  Sgt James may be a ridiculous character, but Jeremy Renner did a great acting job with him.  It's a good movie, to be sure, but it has some flaws.
0316096199|3.0|Alice Sebold has gained much popularity with The Lovely Bones and is an excellent writer. This book is no exception. I do have concern that readers will be unprepared for the graphic nature of this book. If not prepared and given to a young reader, this will end with either lots of unanswered questions or feelings that need to be addressed very carefully. Because it is a true story, it does not come with a happy ending and a bow. It is life. Read with that in mind and if shared with young adult or teen women, discuss. Don't wait for questions, use it as launching pad for a very difficult conversation. Don't assume by the silence that someone has processed the magnitude of the subject matter. Talk. Talk. Talk again. This book will be with you for a long time.

B002ZG997M|5.0|I saw this film by accident. I actually went to the theatre to see \\"Avatar\\" (like everyone else in the state that day) and decided to see the Book of Eli since Avatar was sold out. I'm glad that I did.    The Book of Eli is an amazing film for many reasons, mainly because it handles its religious themes with a intelligence and an even hand. This is NOT an action film - that is the mistake; the movie is a religious fable but not a heavy-handed fire-and-brimstone manner.     Denzel Washington stars as Eli, a man on a cross country mission in a post-apocolyptic America. People have resorted to cannibalism to survive. While Eli stops by a small relatively civilized town, he is confronted by the film's villain played by Gary Oldman who is the leader of the town. He has been searching the countryside, looking for a special book, the book that Eli has pledged to carry across the country. The film revolves around Eli's escape from the town, with a young girl in tow, and his journey across the country.    So that is the basic plot. There is a \\"surprise\\" ending at the end, but there is more going on than just the basic plot. The power of faith, fake religious leaders, miracles and hope are themes that are explored in this film in a very intelligent and effective manner. The Book of Eli can appeal not on the Christians, but the ideas in this movie can speak to people of any faith - or no faith. Its a very positive movie.    Its amazing that this movie was made, it really struck me on a deep emotional level. It will not be popular with the Pat Robertsons of the world due to its criticism of the misuse of religion. Some people will be far too jaded to accept this movie for what it is. I highly recommend this film to anyone; at least watch it once. I can't wait to see it again.

0307454541|5.0|Just a fantastic book - Larsson had fantastic judgement for descriptive narrative, and knew how to move a story along without sacrificing atmosphere and detail. Wonderfully written - one of the most compelling novels I've ever read.
159448385X|5.0|Our current political climate has raised many questions about the Muslim community.  This book gives great insight into the type of struggles associated within a society that is structured on total obedience.  It also demonstrates sadly, the problems that occur when religion says that there are certain instances when it is alright to lie--as was done to the little girl in this story.    The story pulled out many emotions of injustice and sadness, but ended with a  beautiful hope.
1591843162|5.0|An excellent, life-changing, game-changing book! If you're an artist or want to be an artist, you NEED to read this book (and as Seth explains, you don't have to be in the arts to be an artist). Seth's main thesis: \\"If you want to live your dreams, you can't be a cog...you have to be a linchpin! It might not be easy, but it's worth it.\\" I for one am going for it!
B0014YVCDK|3.0|After getting back to a more traditional rocking sound on `Yield', `Binaural' once again finds Pearl Jam experimenting. The result is quite a dark and challenging album, which can be a difficult listen at times. The album is lyrically more downbeat and also has a much thicker production than their other experimental works like `Vitalogy' and 'No Code'. This makes 'Binaural' their least immediately accessible album.     You wouldn't know it from the first two songs, though. `Binaural' opens with the fantastic one-two punch of `Breakerfall' and `God's Dice'; short, sharp rockers which make it seem like the album will be a throwback to the early 90's. From here, though, the album becomes increasingly darker and more experimental. `Evacuation' is another strong rocker, `Light Years' a great ballad, and the fantastic `Thin Air' is one of their most under-rated songs. But most of the other cuts find the band trying new arrangements and recording approaches, in particular the titular \\"Binaural\\" technique. It's fair to say that the results are mixed; the only song to truly benefit from the Binaural recording is the warm, encompassing `Of The Girl'. Other songs such as `Rival', `Parting Ways' and the unlikely single `Nothing As It Seems' feel very claustrophobic, requiring a dedicated listen to penetrate their thick murky shells. And `Soon Forget' is another `Bugs'-like diversion, with the accordion substituted for a ukulele.      Like `Vitalogy', the album is quite strongly front-loaded; the more upbeat and accessible tracks are mostly in the first half, with the biggest departures later on. And like `Vitalogy', it may have been better to mix the accessible and experimental tracks up a bit more, since the second half of `Binaural' is a very challenging listen. Personally, I think it's a bit too inconsistent to rank with Pearl Jam's very best, and some of the second-half experiments don't quite reward the effort you need to put into them. But about half the songs are classics, and they make the album worth it. If nothing else, it's good to see a band like Pearl Jam continue to broaden their sound, even if it doesn't always come off.    3.5 stars.
B0035J6TAI|2.0|Years ago, many years ago, Gabriel would perform Marvin Gaye's \\"Aint That Peculiar?\\" in concert. You can find it on many late 70's bootlegs. Sheer genius. Better than even Marvin's take.    Thus, I looked forward to this release. At best, I'm underwhelmed. Maybe PG crooning like Peggy Lee just doesn't do it for me. It's been a long slog through the years since Secret World Live. And underscoring that is that not one of these renditions will make you forget the original. Maybe it's best to leave Neil Young to k d laing, and David Bowie to King Crimson, both of whom own their versions instead of covering them. Well, there's a fudge there: Fripp played lead on the original Heroes.  Maybe I should have seen this coming. Supposedly PG wrote 150 songs for UP (poor Tony Levin!) & I'm still curious about the 140 left off. OVO was sort of OKO. The official concert discs of UP did the songs a better service than the studio takes, but again, that good will was immediately undone by the official European bootlegs (note to Peter: rehearse, with the band, next time and use a TelePrompTer) and the recent South American boots (second note to Peter: call Sinead, she's looking for work). God bless him for having his family close by, but Melanie sings flatter than any 12 celebrity kids you can gather and flattens every ounce of malicious irony out of \\"Mother of Violence\\". McCartney's kids found something else to do.  So, buyer beware. I am curious, though, to hear Neil do a cover album of Gabriel's tunes. That would be too delicious to resist. (Third note to Peter: keep the drums and guitar. It works, mate.) Neil knocking off Moribund the Burgermeister would be worth anyone's first born child. my my...
B002XMGGK6|3.0|The movie opens with Gerard Butler beaten and tied watching his wife being raped and murdered, and a (thankfully behind closed doors) insinuation that his young daughter has met a similar fate after a home invasion by two thugs.Roll the clock forward to see the broken Butler witness the ADA (Jamie Foxx) cut a deal to virtually free one of the assailants for evidence to bury the other, and explain to the grief stricken Butler, that some justice is better than none.<br />You've seen the trailers, and probably professional reviews, and this looks like a straightforward revenge movie, and it pretty much is, only while trying to be more, and make more social comment, it quickly goes awry.<br />Any sympathy I felt for Butler's character vanished half way through the movie when he begins systematically killing anyone and everyone he can to get back at ADA Foxx, and bring down the flawed legal system. Your initial horror and sympathy begins to wane when you watch him tie up and torture someone to death, the end result making him as psychotic and unbalanced as the men who killed his family. And who knows, maybe that's the message of the movie, that grief and revenge can tip you over the edge? Or is the message that the legal system doesn't work? Whichever it is, it would have been better to channel those ideas into just making a movie, and not being a \\"clever\\" director by telling us what's wrong with the World. Most of us already know thanks.<br />At least most of the movie is feasible, even if it's unlikely. 10 years have passed since the trial, time enough for Butler to set his master-plan into action. The situations and schemes are believable, especially when we find out (of course) that Butler was a former CIA/FBI agency whatever, whose specialty was making people dead, even unreachable people.<br />It's a pretty good taut thriller, predictable, but very watchable with some top notch acting all round. Perhaps 3 stars is a little mean, it just could have been better.
0061438294|5.0|As most of the reviews in the page suggest, this book is quite an interesting book to read.  Although one might consider parts of the book to be common sense, or think that some of the images in the book are too exaggerated (that they are not realistic), I believe everyone reading this would at least gain something from the book.    Navarro is quite a good writer.  The way he lays things out and his explanation are quite clear.  There are some minor typing mistakes and slight repetitions throughout the book, but they do not affect the overall quality of the content of the book.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|Eventually, this next Holocaust-related vaudeville is the latest attempt to professionally contribute a tragic topic visualisation by an \\"eatable\\" way attracting contemporary viewers with murdering, gore, blood mixed with sex, sadism and some historic data.<br /><br />Performing is starling, characters are clever, educated, and professional and worth each other enemies, Brad Pitt is sexy even in moms and baggy camouflage, Hitler looks the most realistic than in any other movie a reviewer had seen, a clone from \\"Adolf & Eva\\" surely  - and something anyway in the air not allowing to top-mark this work. Probably, it is an unnecessary exaggeration of producer's own delusions of both history recorded and glorifying the unspeakable to an extent of heroic.

B002T9H2ME|2.0|First off before I get all the backlash from all the people who loved this movie, I didn't hate this, but realy don't get all the hype on it? In general, the movie I thought, was kind of boring, with an ending that brought little to the table. To be honest, even the ladies at hollywood video had said what a great movie this was besides all the great reviews on amazon. I already knew the movie had a slow beginning and would move along slow, so I sat there watching and waiting to see towards the ending how this thing would play out. Well not to spoil anything but just to say I was realy expecting more. There was no real suspense there. Only because of the good reviews did I purchase the movie, but I found it only mildly entertaining.  I gave this 2 stars only because it didn't live up to the hype.

B002CO1Y2A|2.0|First off I'm not a huge fan of Sammay Hagar vocals. I wasn't thrilled with him on old Ronnie Montrose albums & even though he had a couple of his own solo projects that produced a few good songs, overall he's a guy who looks more like a surf punk with white teeth than a good singer. Yes I saw him in concert with the mighty VH in the Monsters of Rock tour back in 1989 & while it was an enjoyable show, it wasn't the real VH - just a record company, cheap imitation.<br /><br />This album may be the pinnacle of commercial success for VH but it's still pansies & daisies musically. The album is overloaded with Eddies keyboard work in lieu of his guitar work. I was so disappointed at this record when it came out that I quit listening to VH & gave up on Eddie figuring he hit his peak as a `guitar god' who just lost it.<br /><br />`Dreams' is by far the best song on the album but again it's so commercial that any record company band from Boston to Linkin Park could've recorded it. Can we say bland?? It screams RADIO & while I do not fault a band for wanting to get radio airplay, when they switch roles from producing terrific music instead for a lot of fluffy nonsense, it gets old very quickly.<br /><br />Then we have `Love Walks In'. For real? I mean c'mon guys this isn't a band that built its reputation without radio airplay! VH used to do concerts at grocery store openings & they'd have standing room only in the venues they played. They FORCED record companies to come & hear them instead of begging some producer to give them a chance. But when you listen to this track, you go, \\"Scuse me? THIS is VH?\\" It's so syrup laden that it could give a diabetic a sugar coma!<br /><br />\\"Why Can't This Be Love?\\" is the first Van Hagar song I heard & while I liked it, I was sorely disappointed by it. Sammy had gone & pulled the band's focus downward from partying to being all serious. Ugh. Just what the world needs, yet another serious band putting out serious music. We have Radiohead & Midnight Oil for that crap if that's your bag.<br /><br />IF you're VH purist, then maybe you have to have this in your collection but trust me, it's not all that good especially if you've been raised on a diet of `Diamond Dave' with VH's first four albums. We see the shift in musical creativity with Diver Down & how the band used several cover tunes to make filler. Then the next album had it's big song composed of Edward on keyboards. Um no thank you. If I want hard rock keyboard work, I'll listen to some old ELP, Rick Wakemen or even early Ozzy fo rthat! Stick with guitar, Mr. EVH!<br /><br />Overall the production & sound quality of this album is fantastic when compared to the band's older works but really are you buying their production or their musicianship? Th eolder stuff just flat out ROCKS where this is like cotton candy - all sugar & no substance. I give it 2 out of 5 stars.that's your bag.

0743298039|4.0|did enjoy this book, it does keep you reading and wanting to know more.Very atmospheric, old houses and haunting pasts.....prepare to enter<br />another world<br /><br />I like the way this book is written. The narrators style is easy to read and flows beautifully without pages and pages of useless descriptions. As I read I did not realise how dark this story actually is, as the book went on it got deeper and darker, although captivating! You do want to know more, to go further....<br /><br />The story really does stay in your mind when you put the book down!Although........ I have a problem with the end, besides far too dark and sad for me,it felt unfinished, it leaves you guessing, sentences have you trying to figure things out days after you finish the book. This is not always a bad thing,and I am assuming this was the authors intention. I just prefer a solid end.<br /><br />I recommend you read this book, just so at the end you can say 'Whatttt'? 'How' 'Why', 'But' 'If' as those are the words that filled my head for weeks after I finished!<br /><br />Priscilla x
B00005JKN9|3.0|I have been waiting to catch this movie on cable. I knew it had mixed reviews but just<br />by the headlines in Amazon reviews it is more of a mess<br />than I thought. It is a pretty interesting movie; captures the old New York City set, the architecture. If only the version I saw had more character development, I would have swooned. What saved the movie for me was Daniel Day -Lewis's acting.<br />He is a marvel of believability. His voice is perfect. Coming from New York he brought back nostalgic memories. Too bad the movie is embarrassing in the assumptions that if like Shakespeare if one acts with dignity than excuses for no motivation will be allowed. Nope got to have believability on all levels. The faults are not in the acting but in the script.

006621131X|5.0|I heard an interview with Smith on the radio and was intrigued by her description of meeting Maplethorpe in the late '60s. I bought the book on a whim, and it's proven to be one of the best book purchases I've made over the past year. Just Kids is a gorgeously written, tragic love story. It documents the meeting and evolution of two memorable artists, and it captures the tumultuous era in which Smith and Maplethorpe came of age. Buy this book. It will move and affect you. Tell your friends about it. We need more writers like Smith.

B0009MAP90|5.0|I recently read Bob Dylan's enigmatic autobiography, \\"Chronicles,\\" and got the bug to check out some of his earliest material. This album, his first, still has the raw, breakout power that must have stunned the music world when it was released in 1961. Dylan mostly covers old folk and blues tunes, but his versatility and mastery of many folk styles is impressive. Coming in days when most popular music was very \\"white bread\\" and sanitized, Dylan's screeching and rough instrumental work must have seemed either horrifically monstrous, comically debased, or genius. History has shown him to be a trailblazer, much like Elvis, who brought the music of blacks and the underclass into popularity. Dylan does not try to clean up his sources, and employs the cunningly off-key and off-rhythm style that would make him a legend and a source of parody.<br /><br />I listened to \\"Bob Dylan\\" twice through. I was struck by his choice of topics. There were three (!) songs about death (including the incomparable \\"In My Time of Dyin'\\"); a couple of talking blues pieces including Dylan's wry-to-the-point-of-desiccated wit. He sings about leaving NYC to move west...to East Orange, NJ. And in his retelling of his early career (Talkin' New York) he archly relays the complaint of a club owner who beefs that a singer who sounds like a hillbilly, when \\"we want folk musicians here.\\"<br /><br />Dylan fans will have no trouble noting the seeds of the monster talent that Dylan soon became. If it weren't his first tentative foray into recording, this album could have been called \\"The Roots of Dylan.\\" A rough and ready masterpiece and harbinger of an influential musical career.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|I didn't expect this to be as funny as it was, but it is really great. The soundtrack is funny and catchy  and Neil Patrick Harris does a great job in this \\"sing a long blog\\" as Dr. Horrible and Nathan Fillion a.k.a \\"the Hammer\\" (the reason I watched this in the first place) is the perfect non-perfect hero . I could watch this a thousand times and still think its funny. I loved it...
B00027JYLC|3.0|It is a good movie and I thought compassionate. The quality is quite good considering the year this movie was made. I would have given \\"Freaks\\" five stars if much of the movie had not hit the cutting room floor because, when the movie was shown in the theater, some people hated it and parts were removed.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|\\"THIS IS IT\\" certainly would have been a concert to end ALL concerts. The hour and a half footage (not in the original film) showed a blockbuster of costumes, memories of MJ and what the concert would have entailed. NO ONE would have topped this.....and what a way to go out...ON TOP!! I wish the good Lord could have let him perform just ONE concert in London---just to show the magnitude of this concert masterpiece. No doubt, MJ will always be the best entertainer that ever lived. THIS IS IT is a MUST BUY!!!!!!
B00337KMAA|5.0|I watched it in cinema and felt like this has one of the greatest screenplays for years, and the performance of the characters are brilliant. The only thing though is that I felt the movie is not completed and there is something missing, not at the ending, but rather something in the process. But that was the feeling before I watched the Bluray version with the deleted scenes, especially the last two sequences. They actually push the movie to something fantastic, and make the story whole and quite arty. The whole story took place in the troubled time, and everything around was casted in a grey sad colour. But at the end it was\\" family\\" support, warm, comfort and encourage everybody to get through. But what did Ryan get from all these experience or anything changed to his philosophy and his life?  How Nat dealt with the suicide case, would she be in law pursuit trouble? The answer seems to be there, but the movie just did say enough leaving the characters less fullness. The two deleted scenes gave me complete satisfaction on everything. Their running times are every long and in HD quality, well edited. It seems it's just because  they need to fit the movie to the cinema rules, so they have to cut the two deleted scenes down, and I'm sure in later DVD and Bluray, there will be the director's extended cut to show the movie as it should be. If you like this movie, make sure you get to watch those deleted scenes, you will be surprised!

Halle Berry's performance in here was awesome, and who would've thought that the handsome guy I saw was Robert Downey, Jr. Also, seeing Bernard Hill in this was refreshing. I saw it once when if first came out and never knew who anyone was besides Halle Berry. Now, seeing it again, and owning the DVD, I know more people than I did last. Oh! And I can't forget Penelope Cruz! She was also another face I didn't realize was in this movie. =) Total thriller and pleaser.

2226135022|5.0|This is a story told from the point of view of a young boy who is hospitalized and dying of cancer.  An elderly staff volunteer makes a connection with him  and suggests a way for him to seek some mental and spiritual relief.  Although the topic sounds dark and depressing, the book is not . Its lively child- like voice engages you in a relationship with both Oscar and Mame Rose and you find yourself smiling, laughing and shedding an occasional tear with them. The light hearted and youthful writing style provides a welcomed relief from what could easily be a gloomy and morose read.  For students of French it offers a wonderful opportunity to expand horizons, acclimate to another voice, and feel transported to a very French and very remote experience.
1400031001|3.0|...I'd have to say that, even though William Boyd is a very talented writer, he undermines the ultimate depth and reality of his story by throwing too many names at the reader in general (many pages introduce dozens of \\"famous people\\" at one time, all of whom Logan knew or met) and sort of promiscuously mixing real people from history with made up names and personalities.  The reader (me) never feels they are on truly solid ground because of the unavoidable awareness that this is not a real world the writer describes and neither is it some cleverly limned fantasy.  If he had made up his own galaxy of famous writers and artists we could accept that; if he had stuck to real 20th C. historical figures, that would have created a vital, believable setting.  As it is, in Any Human Heart disbelief is not suspended because the reader is always having to stop and figure out if some painter named is real or fictional.  Also, the fictional famous people are really pretty hard to care about. (Why should I be convinced  some guy named Salvatore Flamingo was a great abstract expressionist?)  There are some wonderful moments in the book (usually the longer portions which deal with Logan in some interesting situation, like his time in Nassau or the prison camp) but many too frequent long, drawn out bits which simply report on a string of different personalities who come in and out then disappear without a trace.     Three stars is probably too low; four is too high, Three and a half stars.  There ARE some wonderful moments.
B002WCLG3O|4.0|Halo Legends could best be described as \\"canon filler\\" to bridge the gap in several story lines as well as give some background information on several characters in the Halo Universe.  I consider myself a very big fan of the Halo Universe and feel that I would be a bit more critical on it than others due to this. I will do a review per episode (spoiler free) and fill any gaps as well as give a package review at the end.<br /><br />Episode 1 & 2: Origins<br />Rating: 5 Stars<br />In the closing moments of Halo 3, Master Chief and Cortana find themselves alone on what remains of the ship \\"Forward Unto Dawn\\" with little hope of immediate rescue. Cortana begins a monologue that fills in thousand of years of history in the Halo Universe.  One thing the \\"Origin\\" episodes do very well is answer several questions (even to long time halo fans) about the origins of the races and species of the universe, as well as details on the Forerunner/Flood War, UNSC/Insurrectionist War, and The Human/Covenant War.  The art is very modern anime, vibrant color's (something i feel is important to Halo), and above average animation.  A must watch though just for the story.<br /><br />Episode 3: The Duel<br />Rating: 4 Stars<br />The Dual is the history, origin and legend of the Sangheili (Elite) title of Arbiter.  The story takes place on \\"Sanghelios\\" the home world of the Arbiter.  The \\"Covenant\\" is moving across space looking to rally various species to it's cause promising them great things in return (The Great Journey).  Many of the Sangheili bend to the will of The Prophets and join the \\"Covenant\\" but the actions of the original Arbiter worry the Prophets, in return the Covenant hierarchy construct a plan to shame the title \\"Arbiter\\".  While the art style is modern CG Animation, the studio used a filter to give it a water color look.  While this was a decent approach and something different it seems too blurry at times all is not lost though as the story has a lot of emotion and one hell of a fight scene.<br /><br />Episode 4: Homecoming<br />Rating: 4 Stars<br />First I can not dig to deep in this episode with out going in to spoilers. That being said Homecoming tells the story of the Spartan II solider Daisy-023.  This is more a story of the origin of the Spartan II's and how some of the candidates felt and what happened to when the children where conscripted at a young age without their parents knowing.  The story revolves around a small group of Spartan II's who wanted out of the program and the events that followed.<br /><br />Episode 5: Odd One Out<br />Rating: 3 Stars<br />This being the only non-canon episode in Halo Legends, it tells the story of the Legendary Soldier - Spartan 1337 (leet speak for \\"Elite\\").  This comedic episode plays more to the tune of how absurdly powerful Spartans are depicted by \\"fanboys\\".  The episode is at times comic genius to those familiar with anime such as Naruto and Dragonball Z.  The Animation is average and the story is just fun and has a humorous cameo with Master Chief and Cortana.  The three star rating is based on that it offers nothing to the set as a whole nor is it considered canon in the universe.<br /><br />Episode 6: The Baby Sitter<br />Rating: 4 Stars<br />\\"The Babysitter\\" is about an small group of UNSC O.D.S.T. who are sent on a mission to eliminate a covenant threat and slow the progress of the alien armada.  The O.D.S.T's including Dutch (From Halo 3: ODST) discover they have been assigned a new team member for this mission, which happens to be a Spartan II named Cal-141.  The episodes real focus is on how the O.D.S.T. view Spartans before they understand them and how no matter the cost Spartan soldier will protect humanity at all cost.  The art is modern anime (along the lines of Samurai Champloo / Cowboy Bebop) great color though darker tones to represent the emotion of the story and great dialog between the characters.<br /><br />Episode 7: The Package<br />Rating: 5 Stars<br />This isthe one everyone needs to see.  The Covenant have intercepted a very important package to humanity and the UNSC decides to send Blue Team to recover it.  Spartan II's John-117 (Master Chief), Frederic-104, and Kelly-087 (also including Solomon-069 and Arthur-079) use booster frames to storm through the Covenant armada in space to find the Flagship of the fleet.  The episode is far to fun to spoil as you watch John-117 (Master Chief), Frederic-104, and Kelly-087 rush through waves of Covenant to secure the package.  The art work is modern CG Animation in the same vein of recent \\"Appleseed\\" animated movies, the only complaint is they did not use the english voice actor Steve Downes (Master Chiefs voice actor since Halo: combat Evolved).<br /><br />Overall the multiple story lines and animation types keeps the overall package fresh and it is a must for any Halo fan out there who wants a little more story and less action.ty and the UNSC decides to send Blue Team to recover it.

B002I9Z89Y|5.0|I bought this from BB for the same price this week and the picture is remarkable.  I can only imagine how much time was spent to redo and enhance the visual effects of these episodes. They truly are worth it in my opinion for any die hard Star Trek fan. The images are so crisp and clear. I was waiting for these to go lower in price and when I saw them for this price $39.99, I couldn't resist. Worth every penny of it.
0060920084|1.0|Think of this premise:  Take a road trip, write a supremely boring book with some of the dumbest cliche jokes on the planet, and because your name is Bill Bryson, make a whole bunch of money.      I do recommend this book if you are stuck in prison doing a life sentence and its either read The Lost Continent or stare at the walls of your cell.  For me, I'd stare at the walls.    To be fair and talk about the contents of the book, it is the recounting of Bill taking a road trip to attempt to remind himself of what small town America is like.  He remembered it from his childhood and returned from living in England to see if his memories were what small town America is really like.    In the end, The Lost Continent is as readable as the phone book.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|Gerard Butler gives a solid performance in this movie.  I read other reviews citing him as unsympathetic but I disagree.  Jamie Foxx was the one I had no sympathy for.  His character was very self serving and cold.  Anyway, no five star rating because of the thinness of the plot in many areas and I found myself thinking \\"Oh, come on!\\" at some of the concepts.  All in all, it's watchable.  Of course, when isn't Gerard Butler watchable?
B000AP04OM|5.0|This beloved 1965 classic--one of the world's favorite things-- has all the elements of an Academy Award winner: Exquisite scenery, a compelling story, children, religion, romance, characters serving as comic relief,a memorable musical score, and one family's ultimate triumph over evil.    Based on the true story of former Naval Captain Georg Von Trapp and his second wife, Maria Augusta Kutschera, the film greets us with a serene and panoramic view of the Austrian landscape on a lovely spring day.    High on a green hilltop, momentarily escaping from her convent, is the bobbed haired, pinner-clad novice, Maria( the formidable Julie Andrews) initiating the Rodgers and Hammerstein score by singing the title song, which could not express the communion of music and escaping to nature to find  joy and solace more perfectly.   As urgent as the call of the natural world feels to Maria, the urgent call of the  chapel bell soon  compels her return to the spiritual world of Nonnberg Abbey, where the are nuns gathering for Mass to which Maria will be quite characteristically late.    Peggy Wood's Mother Abbess is a patient woman regarding Maria's shenanigans, but this is not the case with her assistant, Sister Berthe( Portia Nelson). Along with Sisters Margaretta, Sophia, and Bernice,( Anna Lee, Marni Nixon,and Evandne Baker),she ponders her dilemma regarding the renegade novice.    For the Mother Abbess, the answer seems to be to send Maria out into the world as a governess to the seven children of a retired and widowered sea captain.   Little does Maria realize she is being called to bring a somber household back to life.    Reluctantly, she begins her journey, filled with trepidation. Slowly building herself up with her \\"pep song\\", \\"I Have Confidence\\", her feelings of assertiveness wane as she approaches the estate. Greeted rather coldly by the family's butler, Franz(Gil Stuart)upon her arrival, she wanders into the sealed-off ballroom, genuflecting and wondering how she should present herself to the nobleman who is her new boss.   But the gruff captain( a cooly elegant Christopher Plummer) encounters her at the ballroom's entrance. Once they meet, their relationship is a bit antagonistic. But soon, the captain blows his whistle and six of Maria's new charges march downstairs clad in sailor suits to greet her. These include the eldest, 16-year-old Liesl(Charmain Carr), 14-year-old Frederich(Nicholas Hammond), 13-year-old Louisa(Heather Menzies),11-year-old Kurt(Duane Chase), 7-year-old Marta(Debbie Turner), and pug tressed,5-year-old Gretl(Kym Karath). Displaying the same penchant Maria has for tardiness, 10-year-old Brigitta(Angela Cartwright), distracted by another matter, arrives on the scene later.   Maria withstands the pranks of the children to psyche them out at the dinnertable, from which Liesl excuses herself upon learning that her young swain Rolfe(Daniel Truhitte) is close at hand.   The budding romance of the teenagers gives an enchanting moment as the two get caught in the rain.   Housekeeper Frau Schmidt( Norma Varden) helps Maria settle in. Soon, despite Captain Von Trapp's rules about the strict observance of bedtime,  Maria finds herself consoling the youngsters by making them think of their favorite things during the thunderstorm,and proving her worth to the initially skeptical Liesl as well.The captain arrives to express his displeasure. But Maria has plans of her own.   While enduring one of the Captain's many absences, Maria makes the children some play clothes from old bedroom drapes, takes them on outings, and teaches them to sing in multipart harmony as an alternative to playing pranks to get their father's attention.   As the musical education of the Von Trapp children gets underway amid the fabulous urban and rural scenes of Salzburg, their father returns with a couple of very interesting and influential guests, namely, Baroness Ilsa Schroeder(Eleanor Parker), and a chaperoning concert promoter, Max Detweiler(Richard Haydn). As the three gather on the terrace, Rolfe, hoping to contact Liesl, and deliver another relevant message, proves to be a nuisance, hiding behind membership in the HitlerJugend when confronted by the captain.   Soon the captain and his guests are greeted by the joyous band of Maria and the children as they fall from a boat and into the lake at the edge of the terrace.When reprimanded by the captain, Maria defends herself, and openly criticizes his inattentiveness to his children almost at the expense of her job.But the childrens' song for the Baroness and the Captain's joining them in song at the last moment breaks down a long-standing barrier between a grief-stricken man and his children. Maria is allowed to stay.   The second half of the story finds the family in sunnier circumstances, expressing their love of music (as is typically Austrian) through a colorful puppet show, and by the childrens' urging their father to recite a song he hasn't sung in years, accompanied by Liesl.   But Baroness Schroeder begins to see Maria as a rival for the Captain's affections, and her plotting to marry him begins in earnest. Convincing Georg to host a ball to introduce her to his friends, Ilsa acts as a gracious hostess, accompanied by Max and Georg.   Georg's intercessions of Maria's teaching Kurt the Landler causes the Baroness to step up her scheming against Maria, and Max steps up his scheming to have the children in the Salzburg Music Festival after the children charm guests with their good-night song.   A meeting between the two women results in Maria's sudden return to Nonnberg Abbey, leaving behind the heartbroken children, who may end up with an uncaring stepmother.There is evidence during Ilsa's unenthusiastic ball game with the children that Liesl suspects the truth.   A visit to the Abbey, during which the children are turned away from seeing Maria sets the course of more favorable events in motion. The young novice soon has a glad reunion with her charges when ordered to return to the family. The Baroness concedes defeat, acknowledging her incompatability with Georg's family, clearing the way for a beautiful and stately wedding between the captain and Maria in what are truly the Last Golden Days of the Thirties.   The couple return from their honeymoon amid the Anschluss, during which Herr Zeller(Ben Wright) once a guest in the Von Trapp Home, has been named the Gauleiter of Salzburg and shadowy events that were only peripheral during much of the story become central. Rolfe's relationship with Liesl changes.    Georg is soon ordered to fill a postion in the German Navy, and in an act of true moral courage, this truly noble family leave their beloved Austria behind amid moments of poignancy and solidarity with fellow Austrians, the distress of pursuit by those who would compromise them, and the benediction of the Benedictine nuns(two of whom tip the balance in their favor). We leave them en route to a new life elsewhere in one of the most triumphant moments in cinematic history.   The film takes liberties with some aspects of the story while remaining true to others. But in writing this tribute on the 45th anniversary of this film's release, it is considered opinion that the film's message of the triumph of virtue, and the soaring spirit of this enduring classic will continue through the ages.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I have not had fast food since I watched this movie. The food industry should be forced to answer the questions that \\"Food, INC.\\" has raises.

1400034205|4.0|THE RAZOR'S EDGE is a fine read; a well told story with characters that are like real people.  I believe Maugham used real persons as his inspiration for this novel, but only a master of fictional characterization could have adapted the 'real' so adroitly.<br /><br />The plot opens circa 1919, in Chicago, with Larry Darrell, a young aviator who's experienced too much war and is mentally still trying to recover.  He's engaged to Isabel, a moderately well-to-do young woman, whose family - her down-to-earth mother and her wealthy, sophisticated uncle, Elliot Templeton - would like to see Larry settled into a job and the usual lifestyle of a young American male (striving to make a success of his career), before he and Isabel get married.  Larry resists this line of thought and ultimately sets out on a journey of exploration, coming to the realization with Isabel that their engagement must end.<br /><br />The story moves up to 1929-1930, with Isabel, now married to an old friend of Larry's, having moved to Paris at her uncle Elliot's request.  Her husband suffered a mental & physical breakdown following the financial crash of 1929.  Larry's separation from this way of life; what's happened to him on his journeys through Europe and India, are woven into what is occurring with Isabel's family, and her uncle Elliot.<br /><br />This bare-bones plot description doesn't really begin to go into all the nuances of the story and the subtleties of the characters that Maugham creates.  Elliot Templeton, in particular, is a wonderful creation.  Elliot's multifaceted - on the one hand, he could be dismissed as a shallow \\"snob\\", or as comical in his complete immersion in society and high life, when in fact, he's also (aside from being snobbish and somewhat comical because of his aristocratic preoccupations), a kind-hearted, canny, generous and even thoughtful man.  He's also self-made -  a person who saw what he wanted and reinvented himself to achieve his goal.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed reading about Elliot much more than I did reading about Larry's journey of discovery.  I enjoyed the way the novel is written, especially that Maugham made himself a character with *these* characters.  Without trying to reveal too much of the storyline, Isabel is slowly revealed to be quite a monster of selfishness.  (Larry has had a lucky escape.)<br /><br />Some readers may take Larry's confusion and his rejection of a routine, settled life to heart and take inspiration from his life's journey, but by the end of the story, I didn't think Larry was maturing.  I thought he remained insular - self-absorbed for most of the time, both on and off the page.  Yes, he helps certain characters, but he didn't give anything emotionally (he doesn't ever seem capable of love).<br /><br />(SPOILER ALERT):<br />I would have hoped that by the end of his ten years or so of reading, thinking, and exploring the world - and I was not seeking a Hollywood ending - Larry would have found - well, obviously not ALL the answers he was seeking, but at least the feeling that he needed to give more to people in a definite way, both emotionally and in a practical sense.  (He gave practical help to the character of Suzanne, but didn't seem capable of sustained effort in that way.)  Instead of remaining a drifter, \\"living\\" for himself alone, I thought he should be, at the least, actively seeking out the troubled, the sick, the lonely, instead of letting them just happen upon him.  Even giving away his inheritance, the money which allowed him to seek and roam the world, could be viewed as a selfish act - in that in the middle of the Depression, he was setting off back to America with nothing, and likely wouldn't be able to find work, and therefore be a burden on others for food & shelter.  The episode with Sophie troubled me.  Larry *could* have pursued her, devoted himself to her.  His marriage to her could have been an act of unselfishness; become true love.  (They had their childhoodconnection to build on.)  Instead he just lets her go.<br />(END OF SPOILER)<br /><br />Larry was always distant from people - would not always make the effort to talk to them at length, even - removed himself from them several times in the course of the story; wouldn't share his address.  Just \\"living\\", as Larry does, (drifting around, seeking out answers and/or knowledge for oneself) is not enough.  If we all \\"lived\\" in such a way, there would be no grace in this world.  We need to actively seek out and reach out to people, also.  The Larry character is seeking, but he seldom reaches out.<br /><br />Despite my personal dissatisfaction with Larry Darrell's journey 'round the philosophical world and its end result, this is a rich story and so well told, by such a skillful author, that I recommend it highly.r go.

1416914307|5.0|I loved this book.  I loved the whole series, but City of Glass being the last book, (fortunately the series will continue w/ The Clockwork Angel, September 2010) was the best.  C. Clare had some one-liners that made me laugh so hard and there were scenes that moved me so much I wanted to cry w/ happiness.  I still reread pgs. 492-498, 530-533.<br /><br />Jace, is the weaker between him and Clary, but still lovely.  Alec and Magnus Bane were great.  I loved that the author had no problem with this.
B001N26GFM|3.0|I really enjoyed the video.  I meant to order the book.  I bought the book, and read it first.  I felt the book was much better than the movie.  I was not prepared for the ending ... what a twist.  What a horrible time in the history of man.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|I enjoyed watching the documentation of what's going into my mouth from the farms. To me it was  a little to short. I would have love to see more of what go's on at the farm. Everyone needs to   take time out and watch this movie. It Just might help us to make better decision as to what we  put in our mouths.
0123694965|5.0|This is a very unusual book with a very fresh way of looking at experiences of any kind. I have zero connection with formal game design, and yet I think this book has revolutionized my awareness of 'experience products' generally. You could use many the principles described in the 100 'lens' described in this book to 'design' everything from jobs to organizations to dining experiences to software UIs to vacations to relationships.     If you want to understand experiences at a whole new level then get this book.    I often carry the '100 Lens' card deck around with me and find myself looking at just about everything through these lenses.

B0021L8UPS|5.0|This movie rocks!!<br /><br />When Kate (Farmiga) loses her third child during birth, it sends her marriage into a nose dive and drives her to therapy. She has a great husband - John (Sarsgaard) - two lovely kids, and a beautiful house, but the loss has left a void that needs to be filled. Kate and John decide that the best way to do this is to adopt a child. They visit the local Orphanage and are almost instantly drawn to a young girl called Esther (Fuhrman). Esther is from Russia, she is polite and intelligent, and with an old fashioned dress sense and way about her that sets her apart from the other children. Three weeks after their visit to the Orphanage, Kate and John return to collect Esther and take her back home to become part of the family; and that's when things really take a turn for the worse, as they realise that Esther's sweet little eccentricity's are the least of their worries.<br /><br />The cast are all excellent, especially the increasingly desperate Farmiga, but the movie would not be half as effective without the ice cold turn from Fuhrman. Furhrman creates one of the very best screen villains of recent years, cold, calculating and utterly terrifying. After the slow burn of the first two thirds, Collet-Sera pulls out all the stops and goes for broke in the fantastic climax, things do veer a little close to the suspense flick formula, but by the time the credits are rolling you'll just be glad it's all over...and I mean that in a good way.

B0002EXH54|4.0|This album is not only essential to Megadeth fans, but should be among the collection of every metal listeners catalog.  Everyone knows the iconic song \\"Peace Sells\\" with its bassline and memorable lyrics.  \\"Wake Up Dead\\" has always been the real highlight of the album for me, the vocals make way for a riff and guitar solo excursion.  \\"The Conjuring\\" is a pure classic Megadeth song, and Dave won't play it anymore due to his Christian faith!  This is one of Megadeth's best achievements of thrash metal, and those who primarily enjoy their 90's output may need some time to warm up to this one.  If you enjoy this one then promptly see Megadeth's \\"Rust In Peace\\", it even makes this masterpiece pale in comparison.
B002RSDW80|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen. Above outstanding performance of Meryl Streep of course. Hard not to love her and her character. I have watched it 8 times in 10 days. Absolutely lovely and charming love, and career story. Highly recommended.
031606792X|5.0|I have read all 4 books plus the rough of Midnight Sun and I can honestly say that they lead up well to the happenings in Breaking Dawn. I was not overly surprised but I was pleasantly engaged in the books!<br />Bella and Edward both grow dramatically in the course of this series... something I don't think a lot of people think of is that while Edward is 100+ years old he was frozen as he was at 17 which means he wasn't overly mature on many things but...<br /><br />I was not even interested in the series at first but I am now so glad that I decided to read them. They have a few flaws in the writing but I could fuss at the company just as much as any writer... why didn't they edit the odd wordings? Even so, I truly enjoyed this and love the story.<br /><br />So many of the characters grow, learn, develop, and in the end... many 'people' get to have their happy ending. So few people write with true happy endings, SM is a rare author in this age of pain for pains sake and where love must be lost ... Their love is not lost, they get their love, family, friends, and their ever after...<br /><br />TY SM for being willing to risk it all on a very unconventional vampire story!
B0029358GM|4.0|Wilco being Wilco's 2009 release and 7th studio album is an alternative rock release and sounds like REM. The album was a hit in Sweden and Finland. It also did well among the critics. Allmusic, Rolling Stone and Robert Christgau all gave the album good grades in their reviews. All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with photographs of the band. 4/5.

B000NVIGC0|4.0|Sky Blue Sky being Wilco's 6th studio album and 2007 release is a mix of alternative rock and folk rock. It is not as experimental as \\"a ghost is born\\". The album was a hit both in the States as well as in Sweden, Germany and the UK. All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with some very nice photographs of the band. The cover is a bit strange being that the title is sky blue sky and they have a white cover. Allmusic and Rolling Stone both gave the album favourable grades in their reviews and I agree with them. 4/5.
0312370849|3.0|This book started well; the story goes back and forth between present-day France and 1942, telling the stories of a child during the Holocaust and a female journalist in present times in alternating chapters.  Tension builds as characters in both times pursue their separate \\"missions.\\"  However, the \\"missions\\" end halfway through the book, as does the narrative of the little girl in 1942.  The second half of the book tells only the story of the journalist, and this part reads like a bad romance novel.  There are endless descriptions of men pushing back their thick hair, and agonizing internal monologues from the woman---\\"What should I do?  How could he act this way?  What about the baby?\\"---and I finally began skimming pages just to get to the end.    It would be difficult to write a book about the Holocaust that was not moving in some way; in this regard, the author has set the bar very low for herself.  Parts of the story were interesting and emotional, but all in all the low quality of the writing and the boring \\"romance-style\\" second half of the book made this novel a disappointing read.

B0015D3Z4O|1.0|[[ASIN:B0015D3Z4O Hard Candy]]<br />INSIPID. The dictionary description is as follows: 1. without distinctive, interesting, or stimulating qualities. 2. without sufficient taste to be pleasing, as food or drink. flat, dull, uninteresting. 2. tasteless, bland, vapid. This is so far removed in terms of flavor, substance and interest from her earlier albums with songs like Holiday and Lucky Star that it comes off as churned out, run of the mill pop swill. Harsh, I know, but I've always been a fan, and I find this a mealy disappointment. At this point, I think she should focus on acting. I think she's a terrific actress! Like Cher, who I like MUCH BETTER as an actress than singer (never really liked her singing). This has not always been my feeling about Madonna, but I guess I can now say that \\"I'm a big fan ... of her earlier work.\\" Turn to acting, Madonna, as it would appear that there are no more Lucky Stars left in your repertoire. Hard Candy offers nothing tasty!<br />Signed, Disappointed, But Still Hopeful.

B002D1OSNY|3.0|I've read the book and found it very entertaining. It is an easy read even for those who are not into behavioral economics. The experiments explained in the book are very interesting and they are convincing examples of how people can sometimes make irrational decisions.  However, I feel that the author is selling the idea that people are mostly irrational in their choices and so economic theory is completely wrong (since it is based on rational agents). Here is where the book, in my opinion falters. How can the author ignore years of research made by the some of the most intelligent people in economics? In other words, how can it be that Smith, Nash, Arrow, Stigler, etc. all got it wrong? Moreover, how can it be that he has it all right?   My point is that the author should have found a way to place this book into the whole economic literature. Yes, his experiments are convincing. However, these are specific examples of when people act irrationally. Several of his experiments could be modified in order to influence rational decision making by his subjects.
1400052173|5.0|It's hard to figure out how to describe this book. It's obviously a labor of love, both for the science and the people affected by the science. There's a lot of empathy, intelligence, and compassion in this book. The writing is meticulous and evocative. The two threads of the book, described in so many other reviews, fit together in ways I could not have predicted. The explanations of the science involved are phenomenal; they appear to me to be suitable for both scientifically literate readers and those who barely remember what they learned of science in primary school. Likewise, the people she writes about in the other thread are brought to life by her descriptions, without patronizing them or marginalizing their lives in any way.    I think this book is about love. It's about the love of the science, the love of the people involved, and the love of truth (or maybe that's Truth). The stories are vividly told, and impossible to forget. The issues raised by the HeLa line of cells are not played down, nor are they sensationalized. They are simply presented in a way that makes it clear how no answer is completely right, at least not so far.     I will read anything this author writes in the future, on any topic, even one I don't think I care about.

B002OOG6YY|5.0|I bought this as an avid collector of any Blu Ray concerts..was not even a Marilyn Manson fan.  I watched this and am now a HUGE Marilyn Manson fan.  This is one of the most intense and entertaining concerts I've ever seen.  The sound and picture quality is incredible.  The set-list is unbelievable.  Every song literally rocks.  I have already watched this 10 times and can't get enough.  It is worth every penny.  I also never write Amazon reviews but was that compelled to say something.  Buy it.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|If you're looking for a movie to show off your blu ray player to others (or yourself) this is the one! The cinematography alone is worth the purchase. Visually stunning and  simply put, it's candy for the eyes. The story may be too simple for some and bit much in the way of fantasy for others, but I really enjoyed it. Overall, it's a movie you'll find yourself watching again and again because of it's innocence and beauty.<br /><br />I happened to stumble upon this movie a month ago, renting it from netflix on blu ray....I was blown away. I literally smiled with enjoyment through the majority of the film, feeling as though I was watching something very different and special, in the way of movies. I don't know how I missed hearing anything about this movie, it has flown under the radar for over 3 years.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, get your popcorn ready and be prepared to be totally satisfied with this visual treat.

B00006JSS8|4.0|I have not listened to this particular collection, but looking at the songs I was first disappointed that any collection with only two songs from Key Of Life and also only two from Talking Book could be titled \\"Definitive\\".    On more reflection, this simply means that a newcomer to Stevie can buy this collection and then still purchase Songs in the Key Of Life and Talking Book without much duplication. Combined, you would now have a definitive collection.
B000EGDAI4|5.0|This album, along with We Three is essential to any music collection.  It's melodic and accessible and just right for either background or full-on listening.<br /><br />Sonny Rollins is a down to earth musician.  The tracks on Saxophone Colossus lack the more esoteric flights of fancy of say, Coltrane, though there is enough improv to satisfy anyone.  I particularly like St. Thomas and the riffs on Mack the Knife/Moritat are superb.<br /><br />This is as close to perfect a jazz album as you'll find.  Listen to the samples and you'll see what I mean.

Skloot's book is so worthy of my sleeplessness and discomfort here at work the next day as I replay the harrowing account of a woman and family mistreated by medical science and their painful journey to understanding and healing.  Skloot weaves an engrossing tail that reads as smoothly as fiction, and for Henrietta's sake, I only wish it was fiction. I can't get this story out of my mind today, and I am so thankful for Skloot bringing this to life!
B00065GX64|5.0|spoilers.<br /><br />This is a great story of an entire city going crazy with fear over a child killer, played well by Peter Lorre, and in the end, a group of vigilantes tries to dispense justice in their own fashion.<br /><br />It's fascinating to watch the accused insist on his own dark compulsion and claim that he does not remember committing the murders.  Apparently the insanity plea goes back a long way.<br /><br /> He even begs to get the police involved so that he can at least get a fair trial, which the criminals were not willing to give him.<br /><br />There is certainly some over-emoting on the part of the actors, but this was quite common in the early days of talkies, when people were still in the habit of exaggerating everything for silent film work.<br /><br />Good stuff!

B001M5UDGS|4.0|This was a fun ride, filled with great songs performed with flair by Harris, Fillion, et. al.  It would be more fun to see it  with a group of fans with the appropriate props, of course, but it's still very entertaining on its own if you're by yourself.  Joss Whedon continues showing off the musical talents that he first regaled us with in the BTVS musical episode and Firefly.  There is also a rather somber conclusion to this short movie; it left me wanting more.  Maybe a sequel or two?
0140434089|5.0|Wilkie Collins (1824-1889) was a masterful Victorian novelist of what were labelled as \\"sensation novels.' Collins is also among the first English novelists to pen detective stories. Along with \\"A Woman in White\\" he is best known for \\"The Moonstone\\" his periodically published best seller. The novel has been adapted for stage, screen and television a number of times since its publication.<br />  The novel deals with the theft of a huge and expensive yellow diamond dubbed the moostone. The novel's prologue reports that it was initially stolen by Col. John Herncastle who brought it back to England.  All of this occurred during the British Army's storming of the Hindu stronghold of Seringapatam in 1799.<br />  The novel is told by a series of narrators who give their story of the happenings which led to the second theft of the moonstone: The mooonstone was stolen on the night of June 21, 1848 at the Yorkshire estate of the widowed Lady Verinder. Her daughter Rachel is celebrating her 18th birthday that memorable evening; she is presented the valuable gem by her enamored cousine Fredrick Blake. Blake has brought Rachel the stone all the way from London.<br />It was a gift for Rachel from her uncle Herncastle who left it to her in his will. On the night of the disappearance three strange Indian jugglers have appeared on the premises. They are, in actually, three Hindu priests of the Brahmin caste in search of the famous moonstone. They will not let anyone stop them from returning the gem to the idol deep in the Indian jungle which is worshipped by Hindu devotees. The moonstone is stolen that very night? Whodunit?<br />The cast of characters are well drawn, eccentric and quirky. Among them<br />Rachel Verinder-The virginal young maiden who is the recipient of the moonstone<br />Fredrick Blake-Rachel's lover who is one of the prime suspects in the theft due to his debt problems.<br />Godfrey Ablewhite-The pious hypocrite social do-gooder who courts Rachel.<br />Roseanne Spearman-A strange housemaid who has been in prison for theft. She commits suicide by dying in the shifting sands on the coast of Yorkshire. She leaves letters and is a key to unraveling the plot. Roseanne is madly in love with Fredrick Black though she is plain and poor.<br />Lady Verinder-A beautiful widow who is mortally ill. She is Rachel's mother<br />Dr. Candy-a local physician.<br />Eliza Jennings-A fascinating man who assists in the resolution of the mystery. He is medical assistant to Dr. Candy.<br />Miss Clack-the humorously annoying character who is related to Lady Verinder. She seeks to force religious tracts on the unwary and carries a torch for Godfrey Ablewhite.<br />Mr. Bruff-The gruff and rough attorney for the Verender family.<br />Septimus Luker-A shady London pawnbroker.<br />Gabriel Betteridge-A faithful servant of the Verender family. His narration is the longest in the book. He is inordinatley fond of reading Robinson Crusoe while enjoying his pipe and friendship with his two faithful dogs<br />  Along the way the reader will learn about opium addiction, legal matters, love and murder.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|...doesn't mean they aren't after you!      Do we really need to state Martin Scorcese's brilliant craftsmanship and talent at this late date?  It is all on display here, in his latest collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio.  Moody and dark and imbued with an atmosphere of paranoia and dread, of deep mystery and conspiracy, I was completely caught up in this effort to take genre material and find new energy and inventiveness within it.    The early scenes were so overlain with sombre music and portents I was afraid it was going to be too much, but quickly was mesmerized by the tension Scorcese creates and the imagery he creates to bring the movie down into the realm of conscious and unconscious fear and nightmare, of reality and memory. And it is great imagery and flawless technique that continues to spin the tale as it pitches through raging storms without and within toward a conclusion that I was afraid might be a let down, but I found, while not unexpected, surprisingly workable and satisfying.  And, there is even a final kicker that really makes it all worthwhile!    I have to admit I find some critics mystifying.  I think the two doofuses on TV said to Skip It.  Really? Compared to what?  I have to wonder why some people go to the movies.  Is it an intellectual exercise?  Sure, there's that sometimes, but can't they ever allow themselves to be seduced by the sheer ebullience of people working at the top of their game with familiar yet re-imagined material?  To suspend belief just for fun? Shutter Island didn't spring from a world where themes of insanity and conspiracy have never been dealt with before, but it does so with originality and force!    I confess there is still a kid in me that can put aside pre-conceived notions and intellectual pretenses and simply be swept up in the vision of master craftsmen working with good writing and interesting material. It worked for me here.  I can understand if it doesn't for you, but anyone saying the movie doesn't have punch and interest, well....aw, whatever.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|Tarantino again demonstrates his mastery of the individual camera shot: the camera angle, the composition, the color saturation, ...  If you can be satisfied with just this, see this movie.  But if you expect more, you are likely to be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Tarantino is famous for his allusions to other movies, but here it works against him, highlighting this movie failure to incorporate any of the things that made those movies worth remembering.<br /><br />The story is something that you might expect from a group of 14-16 year old boys goofing around shouting out plot ideas, each trying to be more outrageous.  Not only is the convergence of the three story lines forced, the individual lines are a hodgepodges.  Example, in three years the character Shosanna somehow transforms from an orphaned milkmaid on the run to an Parisian sophisticate running a high profile business.  And while regional accents play a key role in another story line, they are ignored in hers.<br /><br />Q: What is the difference between a scene in this movie and real life?<br />A: Real life eventually comes to an end.<br />Many reviews talk about the elongated scenes creating a sense of tension.  For me, it just dragged things out long past the point of caring what might happen.  And that \\"caring\\" was purely curiosity--the characters were too indistinct or cartoonish to warrant any emotional investment.<br /><br />The initial \\"chapter\\" is much discussed in various reviews as masterfully building suspense in the interrogation of the farmer.  But for anyone who has watched an interrogation scene in a competent police procedural on TV, this plays as incredibly false: Totally absent is the critical portion of the \\"dance\\", the sequence where the subject is entrapped by his own explanations.  And the demonstration of the brilliance and special talents of \\"The Jew Hunter\\"? Apparently, other Germans wouldn't think to look in the large, glaringly obvious crawl space under the house.<br /><br />If you watch this for anything other than the technical skill of the individual shots, be prepared to constantly mutter \\"Stupid\\" and \\"Preposterous\\" and \\"Lame\\", but mostly \\"Get on with it already!\\"<br /><br />Addendum (4/29/2010): Be aware that the sadistic war criminals in this movie are the Americans (the title characters).  In contrast, the German colonel (C. Waltz) comes across more as the \\"banality of evil\\", amorally performing his assignments more because he finds them intellectually stimulating than because of his antisemitism.  Although Tarantino movies often have psychopaths and other evil characters as leads, this situation came as a surprise to various viewers I know.chnical skill of the individual shots, be prepared to constantly mutter \\"Stupid\\" and \\"Preposterous\\" and \\"Lame\\", but mostly \\"Get on with it already!\\"    Addendum (4/29/2010): Be aware that the sadistic war criminals in this movie are the Americans (the title characters).

0545123267|2.0|In my opinion Shiver is one the Over-Rated books. When I first read the book description and the story line in amazon, I was quite impressed and was just waiting for this book to reach me.<br />But then, it happened to be a very slow read, also I was a bit detached from the story all thru.<br />Basically I couldn't feel what SAM or GRACE was going thru. Feelings of the character's were not portrayed well. And that is the major drawback(I wonder that should be the basic intention of any Novel).<br />The only thing I liked is the way the author describes things, for it may be woods, or the weather I could virtually feel it.<br />The story, as already stated in the other reviews is told in 2 point of views, SAM's & GRACE's, which was a bit confusing. Some of those didn't even add to the plot. SAM's poetry sounded ridiculous. Feelings of the character's were not portrayed well. Both SAM and GRACE had boring nature.<br /><br />Overall, not worth the hype!
0385528752|5.0|How often do you find that all the people in the room are nodding their heads and agreeing that radical change is essential, but then they go away and do absolutely nothing about it? It is really difficult to get other people to change when you do not have the power to compel them; it is often really difficult to get yourself to change when you know you should. Chip and Dan Heath explain why change is difficult and how you can tackle it in this book.<br /><br />Problems with change manifest themselves in many different ways. Sometimes other people fail to see the need for change that you see. Sometimes the amount of change required seems so enormous that people are unable to motivate themselves to get started. Sometimes change falls victim to procrastination. Sometimes old habits seem too deeply ingrained.<br /><br />The good news is that the authors have clear, practical advice which tackles all of these situations. It involves a rider, an elephant and a path. If you can just direct the rational rider, motivate the emotional elephant and shape the path, you can make difficult changes happen.<br /><br />The book is filled with interesting stories which are enjoyable to read while at the same time making the authors' advice easy to understand and remember. I normally find good books either entertaining or useful; this is one of the rare ones that is both useful and entertaining.

Opening cut David Bowie's \\"Heroes\\" is a gradually ascending string-swathed piece, while Paul Simon's \\"The boy in the bubble\\" is transformed into a melancholic piano piece shorn of all its Afrocentric traces.<br /><br />The remaining 10 songs comprise mostly more recent fare of which I only knew 5 originals; Elbow's \\"Mirrorball\\" (even more sublime here with just strings), Bon Iver's \\"Flume\\" (piano and strings unlike the original's folky guitar), Arcade Fire's \\"My body is a cage\\" (with icy strings replacing the original's drum/guitar bursts), Regina Spektor's \\"Apres moi\\" (a stunning swelling symphonic makeover), and a delicate piano reworking of Radiohead's \\"Street spirit ( Fade out)\\".<br /><br />The other songs are Talking Heads' \\"Listening wind\\" (with a Celtic feel), Lou Reed's \\"The power of the heart\\", The Magnetic Field's \\"The book of love\\" (with some female harmonies - stirring and truly beautiful), Randy Newman's \\"I think it's going to rain today\\" (hymnal with a heartfelt quivering voiced delivery), and Neil Young's \\"Philadelphia\\".<br /><br />Dark and forlorn yet beautiful, these already sound like Gabriel originals. It will be exciting to hear what Arcade Fire, Radiohead, Bowie and the rest do with the Peter Gabriel songs they select.
B000KKUN0M|5.0|I've loved Michael ever since I was seven. This movie was the first glimpse that I seen with him and he was great. It opens up with him performing \\"Man In the Mirror\\", then it shows snippets of him singing as a child. It then shows Michael's \\"Leave Me Alone\\" video. It includes a mini movie of Michael and three children; Michael and the little girl who plays Katie stumble upon a druglord, while looking for their dog Skipper, who runs into the woods after they all are shown playing in the park. The druglord (Frankie Lideo) goes on a manhunt to kill Michael, along with his army of \\"robotic machines\\". Michael gets away after running into a dead-in by wishing upon a \\"lucky star\\" and being transformed into this extremely fast, futuristic car. He goes to Club 30's and his video \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is shown. After it ends, Michael is told by the two boys that Katie was taken by Frankie, so Michael goes to rescue her. At first it seems as if Michael will be defeated, but of course, good trumps evil, so in the end Michael overcomes Frankie's army by turning into a \\"robotic machine\\" himself (much cooler version than Frankie's army) and destroys them. Michael and Frankie have a final showdown and Frankie loses (no surprise there). Michael leaves and the children are sad to see him go. Katie takes it the hardest and wishes upon a star for him to come back and Michael suddenly walks through the fogged streets. After, the reunion they walk to Club 30's where Michael closes with his version of \\"Come Together\\" (I love it).    As a child, I saw him as somewhat magical, because that's exactly how he potrayed himself. He was an excellent singer and entertainer. Though, he's no longer with us he will live on through his music and his children. I love you Michael! R.I.P.

0307454541|5.0|Stylish and engaging neo-noir novel. English is my second language, but I find this book is really to follow, yet complex enough to think about. The writer had a unique style that I can't get enough. Love it.
B0013ND30M|5.0|When we lost our copy of Sleeping Beauty my daughter was so upset.  I got on Amazon to see if I could still find it.  The DVD came just as described with perfect wrapping, and everything.  It also came so quickly that I was shocked!  They were an excellent company to deal with, and I will definitely be buying from them again.

B00004Y6NP|5.0|This album is one of my all time favorites. It inspires my creativity and puts me in the mood to write. Dire Straits as a whole are masters of their respective crafts, and there is not one bad song on this disc. It's relaxing, uplifting, gets the blood pumping, and is inspirational all in one package. I love music that paints pictures and tells stories, and these songs certainly do that. Can't go wrong when all you're looking for in an album is right here on \\"Brothers In Arms!\\"
0767903862|5.0|A fun re-read from one of my favorite authors, Bill Bryson. Any book that Bryson pens is sure to lead to uncontrollable laughter, snorts, chortles or gaffaws, so plan your reading time accordingly. Not recommended reading material for mime class, funerals, or anywhere quiet, confined and where you will be surrounded by strangers - trust me on this. Even your own family members (*ehem* teenage daughters) might have a tendency to think you finally, irrevocably lost it and look warily at you as if you have become possessed by demons or body odor.<br /><br />But I digress. Anyway, Bryson makes the land Down Under come alive to armchair travellers everywhere, and if you're not aching to call your travel agent by the time you finish this book, then I don't think you have an adventurous bone in your body.<br /><br />Australia is a big country, filled with stranger and larger then life flora and fauna then one can possibly imagine. In Bryson's deft and sarcastic way, he manages to poke fun of and fulsomely praise this place at the same time. This is a land where prime ministers go missing forever and no one else in the world knows it, where deadly critters line up on land and in the sea awaiting the unsuspecting human to stumble upon them, where some Australian cities are often closer to other countries then they are to each other and where you can travel 1,500 miles along a rugged, scenic coast highway and pass only 2 other cars...<br /><br />Bryson brings this land, its history, its people and its magnificence to vivid life. You'll laugh, you'll gape in wonder, and you'll sigh that you either weren't born there or don't have the money to get there to see for yourself. Count me as both!
0977476073|5.0|Don't believe the negative reviews... If you pass on this edition, you will truly miss out on a fantastic translation of Mein Kampf!<br /><br />I have read the 1943 Manheim translation, the 1939 Murphy translation, the 1939 Reynal & Hitchcock translation and the 2009 Ford translation. All have their own particular merits, and all appeal to certain audiences. The Manheim appeals to the scholarly and is indeed a faithful, word-for-word translation of Mein Kampf. However, it is incomplete. Further, following it in places can be very confusing in the English language, and many people I know have simply put it down in frustration. It's obviously a scholar's edition, as the German-language footnotes attest.<br /><br />The Reynal & Hitchcock edition is a better flowing edition than the Manheim, in my opinion, but has been out of print since 1943, when the Manheim was published by Houghton-Mifflin. Why? Because Houghton-Mifflin did not want to pay royalties to Reynal & Hitchcock for their translation, so Ralph Manheim was commissioned for a new translation, which is, in fact, clumsier than the original.<br /><br />The Murphy edition is far shorter, a fairly easy read for those who speak/read British English and have a decent vocabulary. However, it is paraphrased - as Murphy read a paragraph and put it into his own words. Not Hitler's words, but in most places, true to the meaning. But in some places, he misses the point (as Ford's book about the MEIN KAMPF translation controversy points out). So if you want Hitler, you won't get it from Murphy...<br /><br />Onto Ford's translation... The thing I like about this translation is that it strikes me as a true PEOPLE's EDITION of Mein Kampf. It is COMPLETE and TRUE to the original, but being a PEOPLE'S EDITION does NOT mean that it is dumbed-down. It simply means it is readable, flows well and keeps the reader's interest throughout. EVERY READER'S INTEREST. And that was exactly what the author, Adolf Hitler, wanted. He wanted EVERYONE in his country to read his book. Not just the university professor. It wasn't for the elite few. It was for the bus driver, the soldier, the unemployed - it made no difference! It was for everyone. In German, it flowed (and still flows) fine. But when translated to English, it doesn't flow so well, as various translations prove. However, with the Ford translation, it flows VERY WELL. It has been restored to its former status and is once again for EVERYONE.<br /><br />Couple this with Ford's explanatory notes in the text as well as his added 27 pages of pictures that show key people and places mentioned by Hitler, and this makes an edition of Mein Kampf that has yet to be beaten.s book.

B001CY5MYC|3.0|In 2003, the film \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" which was a loose adaptation of the novel \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" by Muriel Spark was released in theaters.<br /><br />The film which was released a week before Christmas did quite well at the box office (considering \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\" was dominating the box office) and made over $141 million worldwide.<br /><br />\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" was directed by Mike Newell (\\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\", \\"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\\", \\"Donnie Brasco\\", \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\") and a screenplay by Lawrence Konner (\\"The Sopranos\\", \\"Might Joe Young\\", \\"The Beverly Hillbillies\\") and Mark Rosenthal (\\"Planet of the Apes\\", \\"Mighty Joe Young\\", \\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\\").  The film featured cinematography by Anastas N. Michos (\\"What Dreams May Come\\", \\"Stepmom\\", \\"Dead Presidents\\") and music by Rachel Portman (\\"Grey Gardens\\" TV, \\"The Lake House\\", \\"Oliver Twist\\", \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\").<br /><br />\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" takes place in 1953 when teacher Katherine Ann Watson (played by Julia Roberts, \\"Steel Magnolias\\", \\"Pretty Woman\\", \\"Notting Hill\\") from Los Angeles moves to Massachusetts to teach at Wellesley College, a conservative women's private liberal arts college.<br /><br />Katherine is a teacher who was quite independent at the time and wanted her students, who were very intelligent and had potential to do what they want career-wise and would suggest them to not follow the '50s ideal that a woman must get married, raise a family and not follow a career path.  To not conform to the female stereotype.<br /><br />But in 1953, Wellesley College supported the notion that women married and not follow any career goals despite the students doing exceptionally well in school.  And thus, the conservative women including the board and faculty feel that Watson should not use her class to express her liberal points of views to her students and focus on teaching art.<br /><br />\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" features an all-star case with Kirsten Dunst (\\"Spider-Man\\" films, \\"Bring it On\\") as Betty, the woman who doesn't get along with Mrs. Watson and is also pursuing her life as a married student; Julia Styles  (\\"The Bourne Identity\\" films, \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\", \\"Save the Last Dance\\") as Joan who is highly intelligent and has a chance to go to Yale University to pursue law to be a career woman but also torn by the '50s notion that she must be a housewife and raise a family; Maggie Gyllenhaal (\\"The Dark Knight\\", \\"Adaptation\\", \\"World Trade Center\\") as Giselle, a woman who has had a difficult childhood and has had flings with the male teaching faculty; Ginnifer Goodwin (\\"Big Love\\", \\"Walk the Line\\") as Connie, the student trying to find love; and Marcia Gay Harden (\\"The Maiden Heist\\", \\"Damages\\", \\"Mystic River\\") as Nancy, the roommate of Katherine who has become a somewhat of a recluse.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" is feature in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:85:1).  The film looks much better over its DVD counterpart as skin tones are natural but the film is not vibrant as I would of hoped.

The detail that I was hoping to see in the Blu-ray release may be better than the original DVD release but it wasn't as brilliant, sharp or clear as I was hoping.

B001TD1XWG|5.0|Do you guys remember the first time you listened to The Beatles, Led Zeppelin or Jimi Hendrix?  These bands have left a major impact on my life and forever changed the way I look at music.  30 years from now we will all be asking ourselves the same question for Rebirth.  This is truly a staggering achievement in musicianship that will not be matched for a very long time.  Probably ever.<br /><br />From beginning to end this album blasts your eardrums with originality.  The colossal guitar riffs are so technical and precise they make Eddie van Halen green with envy.  Vocally I haven't heard this much range since Mike Patton was fronting Faith no More.  Lil Wayne's singing goes from a silky smooth croon to an epic crescendo burst that leaves the listener stunned and begging for more.<br /><br />Rebirth is a religious experience.  I now know what it felt like to be a christian after watching Passion of the Christ.  My ipod was soaked from tears of joy but I didn't care.  I was shown the light and I have seen the savior of Rock n Roll.  His name is Lil Wayne.  Like todays hip hop, everyone in rock will want to work with Weezy now.  Lets all pray that a Lil Wayne and Radiohead collaboration is in the future so all of our heads will simultaneously explode from the overwhelming awesome.  Thank you for this album Lil Wayne.
B002ZTQVBQ|4.0|In 2008, Studio Ghibli released their latest Hayao Miyazaki film \\"Ponyo\\" (aka \\"Gake no Ue no Ponyo\\") in Japan and followed with a U.S. release in August 2009.  The film which is Miyazaki's eighth film for Studio Ghibli has amassed several awards including the Japanese Academy Prize for Animation of the Year.  The film which is budgeted around $34 million dollars made over $199 million worldwide.  Where his 1988 film \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" was Miyazaki's tale for older children, this time around for \\"Ponyo\\" he wanted to create a film for young children and was inspired from Hans Christian Anderson's \\"The Little Mermaid\\".<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />Magical, beautiful and everything that you can expect from Hayao Miyazaki.  I was completely in awe when I watched this film.  In this day and age, we tend to put so much into CG animated films and rarely do we see hand drawn quality animation anymore.  I'm so glad that Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli continues to show this creative style through this film. The hand painted backgrounds are absolutely beautiful, the character design continues that Miyazaki look and style but looks absolutely fluid during its more action-oriented scenes.<br /><br />Presented in 1080p High Definition, detail can be seen on the painted backgrounds.  Vibrant during the day scenes with trees that are full of detail and water reflecting the trees, cliffs showcasing the detail as shadows and detail showcasing the curvature and the little pieces of grass that are placed within the rocks.  The scene with the storm and the crashing features Miyazaki's handiwork as he created the water and his waves all by himself.  It's an amazing sight to see.<br /><br />There are no compression artifacts, edge enhancement, aliasing, banding or any problems in picture quality for \\"Ponyo\\" whatsoever.  \\"Ponyo\\" achieves perfection!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Ponyo\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and in Japanese and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  First the good.  The English dub track is fantastic.  You want an immersive soundscape, \\"Ponyo\\" delivers.  From the sound of the ocean, bubbles popping, the rush of the waves, the sounds of trees rustling, the sound of rain, sea animals swimming in the water and most of all, a beautiful musical score by Joe Hisaishi.  This soundtrack is absolutely divine.  Great use of front and center channels with dialogue and music that is crystal clear.  The surround channels and the use of LFE as the sound effects bring \\"Ponyo\\" to life.  This lossless soundtrack is perfect!<br /><br />Now the bad.  There is no lossless Japanese audio soundtrack.  The Japanese Blu-ray release has a lossless soundtrack but what happened to it for this Blu-ray release?  There is no doubt that audiophile purists who want the original Japanese soundtrack are going to be upset by this and one can hope that if Disney does bring out a Miyazaki release on Blu-ray in the near future, that a lossless soundtrack is included for both the English and Japanese audio.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Ponyo\\" has a good number of special features in 1080p High Definition and 480i Standard Definition.  Audio is in English 2.0 Dolby Digital and subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Special features include:<br /><br />  * Meet Ponyo - (3:22) Executive producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy talk about working with Hayao Miyazaki and give a quick introduction to \\"Ponyo\\".<br />  * Original Japanese Storyboards - Watch the entire film but this time with the video showcasing the original storyboards.<br />  * A Conversation with Hayao Miyazaki & John Lasseter - (3:31) PIXAR's John Lasseter and a friend of Hayao Miyazaki talk about \\"Ponyo\\".<br />  * Creating Ponyo - (3:58) Hayao Miyazaki talks about how he came up with the concept of \\"Ponyo\\" and him wanting to create a film for children.<br />  * Ponyo & Fujimoto - (2:59) Hayao Miyazaki talks about the name \\"Ponyo\\" and the character Fujimoto.<br />  * The Nursery - (2:00) Studio Ghibli Producer Toshio Suzuki talks about Miyazaki wanting to create a children's nursery and both men made Miyazaki's dream happen by creating the Studio Ghibli Nursery.<br />  * Producer's Perspective: Telling the Story- (2:27) Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki talks about how Miyazaki works and creating the storyboards and story for \\"Ponyo\\" and more.<br />  * The Locations of Ponyo - (9:32) An excerpt from a Japanese documentary on Miyazaki's animated films and visiting the areas that inspired Miyazaki to create the village of \\"Ponyo\\".<br />  * Scoring Miyazaki - (7:19) A featurette about Joe Hisaishi's scoring Miyazaki films and more.<br />  * Original Japanese Trailer - (3:22) The original Japanese theatrical trailers.<br />  * Behind the Microphone - (6:04) Featuring the English dub voice talent talking about their role, their appreciation for Miyazaki and his films and interviews with the All-star talent.<br />  * My Neighbor Totoro - Creating My Neighbor Totoro - (3:00) Miyazaki talking about the creation of his film \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\".<br />  * Kiki's Delivery Service - Creating Kiki's Delivery Service -  (2:27) Hayao Miyazaki discussing the creation of \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" and what inspired Miyazaki for the creation of the city in the film.<br />  * Castle in the Sky: Character Sketches - (2:37) Miyazaki talks about the characters of \\"Castle in the Sky\\" and discussing how his audiences are loyal to his films over time.<br />  * Enter the Lands - Visit the land featuring various small animated Studio Ghibli characters (from all films).  Click on a character from that film (note: only \\"Ponyo\\", \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\", \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" and \\"Castle in the Sky\\" are available) to get a Q&A or a small video info. of that film and its characters.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />A DVD of \\"Ponyo\\" is included with this Blu-ray release.  The DVD is in Widescreen (1:85:1) - Enhanced for 16×9 Televisions, English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, Japanese and French with subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Once again, Miyazaki continues to prove to us that hand-drawn animation is absolutely beautiful and there is no need to join the pack and create a CG animated film.  \\"Ponyo\\" succeeds on all levels - storyline, animation, music and its soundtrack.  I absolutely loved this film!<br /><br />Before I saw the film, I figured that people were so used to Miyazaki's more serious work and for him to try to go back to something similar to \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" was going to be difficult in this day and age but with \\"Ponyo\\", he managed to pull it off.  The world he creates is magical, the characters are just enjoyable to watch.  From every scene, I was literally just loving the animation and the painted backgrounds and to find out that Miyazaki actually drew the sea and the waves himself using 170,000 separate images is amazing.<br /><br />In terms of any deep messages on society or ecology, in \\"Ponyo\\", we see how trash and waste has been collecting on the ocean floors and Ponyo being stuck in a bottle lying in a wasteland under the sea.  For Fujimoto, as he tries to maneuver underwater, waste and garbage is everywhere.  So, it was great to see Miyazaki convey how people have mistreated the ocean with their garbage and incorporating it to the storyline.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is absolutely beautiful when it comes to picture quality, lossless audio and also contains a good number of special features.  If there was only one thing that prevents this Blu-ray release from reaching perfection is the lack of a lossless Japanese audio soundtrack.  But both English and Japanese vocals are well-done with the English track featuring all-star talent with Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, Cate Blanchett, Betty White, Cloris Leachmen, Lily Tomlin and Matt Damon providing their voices for this film.  Even Jonas Brothers sibling Frankie Jonas (as Sosuke) and Miley's younger sister Noah (as Ponyo) do a great job as the primary vocals.  The Japanese soundtrack features two of Japan's top celebrities with George Tokoro lending his voice for Fujimoto and Tomoko Yamaguchi as Lisa.  And also Hiroki Doi (Sosuke) and Yuria Nana (Ponyo) do a wonderful job providing the main voices for the Japanese audio track as well.<br /><br />Overall, Hayao Miyazaki is truly a remarkable filmmaker and \\"Ponyo\\" is a true masterpiece.  Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli show no signs of waning and they manage to capture the magic that I have felt when I was younger when I first watched Ghibli classics such as \\"Nausicaa\\", \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\", \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" and \\"Laputa: Castle in the Sky\\".

But both English and Japanese vocals are well-done with the English track featuring all-star talent with Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, Cate Blanchett, Betty White, Cloris Leachmen, Lily Tomlin and Matt Damon providing their voices for this film.   Even Jonas Brothers sibling Frankie Jonas (as Sosuke) and Miley's younger sister Noah (as Ponyo) do a great job as the primary vocals.  The Japanese soundtrack features two of Japan's top celebrities with George Tokoro lending his voice for Fujimoto and Tomoko Yamaguchi as Lisa.  And also Hiroki Doi (Sosuke) and Yuria Nana (Ponyo) do a wonderful job providing the main voices for the Japanese audio track as well.    Overall, Hayao Miyazaki is truly a remarkable filmmaker and \\"Ponyo\\" is a true masterpiece.  Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli show no signs of waning and they manage to capture the magic that I have felt when I was younger when I first watched Ghibli classics such as \\"Nausicaa\\", \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\", \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" and \\"Laputa: Castle in the Sky\\".  This Blu-ray release is highly recommended!

After viewing the film, I was moved to tears and have decided to buy ONLY organically-grown meat and produce. My family depends on me to cook delicious and nutritious meals and I am glad I purchased this film. THANK YOU, Robert Kenner for such an informative, enlightening film! Rita J., Alabaster, AL
B002P8O29K|5.0|John Burks of Rolling Stone Magazine called the free concert at Altamont Speedway on December 6, 1969 as \\"Rock & Roll's Worst Day\\".  Many performers called it the end of the peace movement.<br /><br />With the success of the Woodstock Music & Art Fair in Woodstock, New York in August 1969, many people have wanted to see a concert in the West.  So, what better to have it in California with a free concert to be held on a Saturday, December 6, 1969 at the Altamont Speedway in Northern California. With an amazing lineup which would include the Grateful Dead, Santana, Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Crosby, Stills & Nash and rock n' roll's most electrifying band, the Rolling Stones.<br /><br />And the footage would be recorded as part of a documentary on the Rolling Stones 1969 US Tour directed by Albert and David Maysles  (known for their work in 1968 for \\"Salesman\\" and later in 1975 for \\"Grey Gardens\\") and Charlotte Zwerin.  Of course, the documentary known as \\"Gimme Shelter\\" would become more than just a documentary about the Rolling Stones, it would be a documentary that would capture the Rolling Stones performing at the Altamont Speedway concert.  A concert unlike Woodstock which was peace, love and rock n' roll, the free concert at Altamont was stained with violence including a homicide.<br /><br />\\"Gimme Shelter\\" received restoration for it's 30th year anniversary in 2000 and in 2009, the film was given its High Definition treatment by the Criterion Collection as it was released on Blu-ray.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Gimme Shelter\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition with its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1:33:1.  According to Criterion, the new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from the 16mm camera original and the 35mm duplicate negative under the supervision of co-director Albert Maysles.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.<br /><br />Although I have never owned the standard DVD version of \\"Gimme Shelter\\", I would assume that this high definition release is the definitive release yet.  There is a good amount of grain on the film but personally, this is literally a time capsule of a significant event in American music history.  It's not a pristine video transfer but again, considering the original source, I felt that \\"Gimme Shelter\\" looked very good.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />As for the audio for \\"Gimme Shelter\\", according to the Criterion Collection, the soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original 35mm magnetic multitracks.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  You get two lossless audio tracks.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1  and the DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.<br /><br />I compared the two soundtrack and I felt the 5.1 track, the audience is more prominent and I just felt the electric guitars, percussion and bass were more punchy and clear.  Especially Mick Jagger's vocals during the performance scenes but the 2.0 track is no slouch either for those who prefer to have that stereo option.  The soundtrack sounds great coming from the front channels as well.  So, it really comes down to audio preference.  I'm more the immersive soundscape audiophile who prefers hearing sounds all around than just the front channel.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Gimme Shelter - THE CRITERION COLLECTION #99' comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary - Audio commentary featuring directors Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin and collaborator Stanley Goldstein.  This is the same commentary from the 2000 DVD release.<br />  * 1969 KSAN Radio Broadcast - (30 minutes) Audio excerpts from KSAN Radio's Altamont wrap-up, recorded December 7,1969, with introductions by then DJ Stefan Ponek for the 2000 edition.  Expect to hear comments from Emmet Grogan, leader of San Francisco's counterculture movement, Sonny Barger, head of the Oakland Chapter of the Hells Angels at that time.<br /><br />  * Outtakes - (19 minutes) Performances by the Rolling Stones at Madison Square Garden in 1969, including \\"Oh Carol\\" and \\"Prodigal Son,\\" plus backstage outtakes and footage of the band mixing \\"Little Queenie\\".  Backstage includes Mick Jagger jamming with Ike and Tina Turner at Madison Square Garden.<br />  * Images from Altamont - Altamont stills gallery, featuring the work of renowned photographers Bill Owens and Beth Sunflower.  Awesome still images from the event.<br />  * Trailers - Two theatrical trailers plus the re-release trailers.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />  * 40-Page Booklet - Featuring the following essays: \\"Rock-and-Roll Zapruder\\" by Amy Taubin, \\"The True Adventures of Altamont\\" by Stanley Booth (who traveled with the Rolling Stones and gives his insight and experience at the Altamont event), \\"Snapshots from the Road\\" by Georgia Bergman (who was the personal assistant of Mick Jagger from 1967-1972), \\"The Decade that Spawned Altamont\\" by Michael Lydon, \\"The `Demonic Charisma' of Gimme Shelter\\" by Godfrey Cheshire (film critic/filmmaker) and a big fan of the film, who challenges Pauline Kael's 1970 review.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />This is probably the first Criterion Blu-ray which I watched once, watched it again and days later, watched it once again.  I suppose that like some people who have re-watched the Zapruder JFK assassination footage or the video footage from momentous times that were significant, you just can't stop watching it.  \\"Gimme Shelter\\" was a documentary that captured my attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />We get literally two documentaries in one.  We get to see the rock legends, the Rolling Stone at their best in Madison Square Garden performing with such flair.  This is the Rolling Stones that I would have loved to see perform back in the late '60s and early '70s.  I was just in awe by their performance in this documentary because my exposure to the Rolling Stones was what I have seen from the '80s and now.  I can see why my parents and millions of people loved the band back then.  Mick Jagger was just all out and cool and to see him and the band on stage was just fantastic.<br /><br />And then we get what was supposed to be an awesome day of music, becomes the worst thing you can imagine happening at a music festival.  Chaos.<br /><br />For one thing, watching it and thinking how this event was pulled off with lack of organization, lack of security...it leaves me in awe.  Granted, the film was created before I was born and with the way things went at the Monterey Pop Festival and Woodstock, I am guessing that organizers were not expecting any chaos.  After all, it was a time of peace and love.  But also, people were on some major drug trips at the time and for the Hell's Angels, they came for the beer and to do their job of protecting the stage and they came in the cue sticks and if people were going to get in the way, they were going to get beat down.<br /><br />In hindsight, one can wonder how in the hell this could of happened but watching the film, was there any doubt that any decorum would take place?  This was organized chaos and David and Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin were in the right place at the right time.  No one expected four people to die at this event, then again, no one expected people to give birth at this event.  I've read that no one expected 300,000 people to be at this event but when you have these major bands headlining, especially the Rolling Stones, this was significant and somehow, it's hard to comprehend some of the decisions that were made prior to this event happening.<br /><br />Keith Richards told the London \\"Evening Standard\\" in regards to the Altamont event, \\"Really, the difference between the open air show we held here in Hyde Park and the one there is amazing. I think it illustrates the difference between the two countries. In Hyde Park everybody had a good time, and there was no trouble. You can put half a million young English people together and they won't start killing each other. That's the difference.\\"<br /><br />May it be the naiveness of the Stones and their manager but regardless, \\"Gimme Shelter\\" shows us the end of the hippie era.  Where \\"Monterey Pop\\" and \\"Woodstock\\" which both have respected documentaries showed the good of music during the late '60s, \\"Gimme Shelter\\" showed us the bad.  Where hundreds of thousands of people were expecting awesome music for the day, those who were in the front row got to see the worst.  And the Maysles  and Zwerin were there to capture it on camera.  The filmmakers were at the right place at the right time and for decades, many people can watch this film over and over and listen to the wonderful music of the Rolling Stones but also get a dose of chaos all in one documentary.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release of \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is once again, another magnificent release from the Criterion Collection.  The restoration and how its presented on HD is great, considering this is a 40-year-old film.  And also special features and a booklet that are equally fantastic.  This is a release that is simply worth owning.<br /><br />\\"Gimme Shelter\\" is a fascinating documentary that has endured for decades and for us who were not around during that time, we watch this film like we see other tragedies that happened in American history, we see this and ask \\"why?\\".  Like those who stood and cheered in Arlington, Texas with smiles on their face and then see chaos of John F. Kennedy being murdered.  Here we are six years later after Kennedy's death but this time, at an even that was supposed to be peaceful and somehow ended up becoming deadly and the cameras catching the events leading to Meredith Hunter's death.<br /><br />The documentary leaves us and possibly the viewers of other generations after me asking how can this happen?  Why were the Hells Angels brought in?  Why was this even so badly organized?  Why did Hunter bring a gun?  Too many questions but not many answers?<br /><br />\\"Gimme Shelter\\" is a fascinating and important film covering that one day where rock n' roll went wrong.

0061968579|3.0|Okay. So a week before the movie came out, I Picked up the original novel by Dennis Lehane. I started to read it one morning... and finished it in a couple hours. I could not put it down no matter how hard I tried. It was suspenseful as all hell, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! It also made me go nuts as to wanting to know what would happen. I went so far as to drawing out Rachel's code on a piece of paper and trying to solve it myself I swear! One of the best books i've ever read.<br /><br />Now I tried getting a copy of the graphic novel before seeing the movie however I never got the chance. The movie was great though! About 96% accurate to the book! But anyway, I finally got a chance to pick up the graphic novel today and i knocked it out in about an hour and a half. It was a VERY quick read. When it first started off, it wasn't bad at all. VERY decent. Stuff was missing but nothing totally vital, after all it is an adaptation, what do you expect? But then around halfway/3 quarters into the book... it just felt completely rushed!<br /><br />WHOLE ENTIRE CHUNKS to the story were missing! Extremely IMPORTANT stuff mind you. What was a whole half of the original novel was done here in about 25 pages. Just SO MUCH information was missing! It was a huge downer being that I was actually REALLY enjoying it up until halfway/3 quarters into it. It was kind of a bummer, I was originally gonna give it 4/5 but so much info was missed that I had to drag it down.<br /><br />The artwork isn't bad. Not my favorite but it isn't bad. It is a little difficult to tell the Marshals from one another. But I paid attention to the fact that Teddy was skinny with slicked back hair and Chuck was a little bit chubby with curly hair.<br /><br />All in all, adapting Shutter Island into a graphic novel was a great idea... but it could've definitely been executed better. I hope they re-release this in better form cause it wasn't bad... but it still needs work. Read the original novel BEFORE reading this or seeing the movie. I HIGHLY recommend the book and film, but only suggest this if you truly love this story.<br /><br />3/5ing the movie. I HIGHLY recommend the book and film, but only suggest this if you truly love this story.    3/5
B001OQCV2O|5.0|In 2012, the Mayans have predicted the end of our world according to the Mayan Long Count Calendar.  A time where the world is destroyed but then is recreated to reset the calendar cycle which lasts 5,125 years.<br /><br />But like Y2K, there are people who fear that something post-apocalyptic will come on December 21, 2012 and if there is one director who is known for doing such films, Roland Emmerich (\\"Stargate\\", \\"Independence Day\\" \\"Godzilla\\", \\"The Patriot\\", The Day After Tomorrow\\", \\"10,000 BC\\") has had his share of working on a few significant titles.  Along with screenwriter Harald Kloser (\\"10,000 BC\\") who is known for composing music for films, cinematographer Dean Semler (\\"xXx\\", \\"Bruce Almighty\\", \\"Get Smart\\", \\"Apocalypto\\") and composer Thomas Wanker (\\"10,000 BC\\", \\"Dracula\\", \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" TV series), the filmmaker would embark on his most ambitious film yet.<br /><br />\\"2012\\" is a film that focuses on the destruction of world and to create that means major CG work and a hefty production budget (which the film was budgeted at $200 million).  Despite receiving mixed to negative reviews for the film's focus on CG and action, the film did remarkably well in the worldwide box office, earning over $769 million.  And now, the film receives its Blu-ray release with a Three-Disc Special Edition (note: the slipcase and cover say Two-Disc Special Edition, but does come with a digital copy which is usually considered as a third disc).<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"2012\\" looks absolute awesome in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio is 2:40:1).  The film is just absolute colorful and vibrant during the outdoor scenes.  A lot of detail as we see the visual effects in full force during the surface cracks to full earthquakes revealing the destruction and chaos of the whole scenery.  Blacks are nice and deep, picture quality is detailed and sharp.  I did notice one segment in the beginning of the film with a bit of banding but for the most part, the film looks great and this is one of those films where you say that CG was well done.  The scenes with Jackson and family trying to escape a sinking Los Angeles is just absolutely awesome.  This film showcases the best in visual effects and because the film is CG-driven, is either going to impress people or turn people off.  But this is a film about the planet's devastation and for something at this magnitude, it has to look convincing and I believe Roland Emmerich and team really pulled it off<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />For audio, \\"2012\\" is incredible!  The lossless audio is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio and also comes with an English - Audio Description Track in Dolby Surround.  But this is one of those films that you can't just help gush over when it comes to audio.  From the moment you put the disc on to the end, this is audio that audiophiles dream of.  The lossless audio is absolute immersive as the whole soundscape of your room (especially if you have a solid 7.2 setup) features audio during the action driven scenes of the film.  And the good news, there is a ton of action and sounds from all over the place.  Well-planned audio and directing sounds to various channels.  How awesome is that?<br /><br />From the sound of an elevator, an obstructed gear, to helicopters and airplanes flying, water rushing in, earthquakes, animals, insects and literally with the destruction of the planet, you can hear the lossless audio utilized well throughout center, front, surround and rear surround channels.  Also, great use of LFE and if anything, \\"2012\\" gives your audio setup a nice workout.  Personally, I found the audio to be quite phenomenal and hands down the best audio on a Blu-ray release for early 2010.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"2012\\" comes with the following special features on two discs.  Special features are in High Definition with audio in English Stereo and English subtitles.  Included are:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Picture-in-Picture: Roland's Vision - While watching the film, you can see/hear director Roland Emmerich talking about his experience working on the film.  From planning and writing the film, discussion of the plot and the film's special effects and more.  This is where viewers can see most of the behind-the-scenes footage for \\"2012\\".<br />  * Commentary with Writer/Director Roland Emmerich and Co-Writer Harald Kloser - Where the Picture-in-Picture had more of an in-depth commentary, the audio commentary tends to focus on the written aspect of the film and character development, various scenes and also set design.<br />  * Alternate Ending - (3:39) A different ending for the film, which I'm glad they didn't use.<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />  * Interactive Mayan Calendar - An interactive Mayan Calendar for one to get horoscopes, personality profile and more.<br />  * Mysteries of the Mayan Calendar - (3:52) A short featurette about the Mayan Calendar and its mystery.<br />  * Deleted Scenes - (4:54) A total of five deleted scenes: Limo Drive with twins, President Wilson Talks with Sally, Something must have gone wrong, Jackson Underwater and Anheuser Apologizes.<br />  * Designing the End of the World - (26:03) The visual effects behind \\"2012'.  Featuring director Roland Emmerich and the talent talking about filming in mostly blue screen.<br />  * Roland Emmerich: The Master of the Modern Epic - (9:31) Talent and crew talk about working with Roland Emmerich.  Emmerich talks about making another disaster film and how he wanted to do a modern \\"Noah's Ark\\".<br />  * Science Behind the Destruction - (13:19) How the filmmaker worked with a geology professor at USC and other people familiar with the 2012 prophecy for the film.<br />  * The End of the World: The Actor's Perspective - (7:34) The talent talk about making of the film and working with Roland Emmerich and their perspective of the destruction of the film.<br />  * \\"Time For Miracles\\" Music Video by Adam Lambert - (4:19) \\"Time For Miracles\\" music video.<br />  * Making the Music Video \\"Time For Miracles\\" with Adam Lambert - (2:43) Interview with \\"American Idol\\" finalist/runnerup Adam Lambert of the making of his first music video.  Also, feat. Roland Emmerich and music video director Wayne Isham.<br />  * Countdown to the Future - (22:03) A featurette about the Mayan prophecy and if the year 2012 is a dawn for a new era or the end of the world?<br /><br />NOTABLE EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"2012' also comes with a digital copy for PC & Mac Versions and PSP Version.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I enjoy disaster films and I enjoy Roland Emmerich's disaster films.  \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" and \\"Independence Day\\" were films that captured your imagination, loaded with action and visual effects that there is always something happening onscreen.  When it comes to these disaster films, especially Emmerich disaster films, you come to see disaster and not a deep story and I think this is where critics had a problem with \\"2012'.<br /><br />Is it a deep, plot-driven film?  No.  Is it a romantic film?  No.<br /><br />If anything, since Emmerich's \\"Stargate\\", you come to his films seeing how far he can take visual effects.  But for those who are expecting cinematic storytelling, this is not a film for you.  Where we seen James Cameron create a masterpiece with \\"Avatar\\" by combining storytelling and visual effects, Emmerich's disaster films is where disaster takes the front row.  How far can he make things look convincing and the peril of humanity. When it comes to disaster films, I suppose that one who has watched many of them including the 1958 film \\"A Night to Remember\\", the 1970 film \\"Airport\\", the 1972 film \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\",  the 1974 film \\"Towering Inferno\\" or even the 1997 film \\"Titanic\\" are disaster films at their best compared to a film such as \\"When Time Ran Out...\\" (1980).<br /><br />Emmerich said he wanted to redo a modern \\"Noah'sArk\\" and in that sense, he did a great job.  To show how these cities and countries are destroyed has to look convincing and his visual effects crew pulls it off.  Yes, if you look at the film and expect anything serious, you are going to be disappointed.  The storyline is very farfetched as Jackson and his family are just a step, a few seconds away from their demise.  But if anyone has seen Emmerich's last films, isn't this usually the case? And at around 158 minutes, the film may seem too long for some viewers and some may feel that Emmerich was overdoing it by forcing too many action/disaster scenes on the viewer.  And I suppose, if I watched this film in the theater...maybe I would have felt that way.<br /><br />But I have enjoyed Roland Emmerich's films, no matter how CG-driven they are.  I am not expecting anything monumental in cinematic storytelling, I watch his films simply as a popcorn flick in which visual effects takes a prime seat and see how far he is able to take things and in \\"2012\\", how much destruction he can pull off.  His disaster films are not for the serious minded and \\"2012\\" is not a film to expect anything deep in terms of character-driven storylines.  It's a film about humanity trying to survive apocalypse.  How does the government respond?  And sure, some may feel \\"oh, we've seen that with `Deep Impact' or `Independence Day'\\"?  But, Emmerich and Harald Kloser do a good job of taking things in a different direction.<br /><br />On Blu-ray, audiophiles will simply love how the lossless soundtrack sounds on their system.  Your room just envelops with audio and directions of the sounds carefully planned and to full effect.  This is what I love about seeing this film on BD.  The picture quality is also very well done and it really brought out the details of the destruction of the world.  And of course, a lot of content, especially for those who have interest in \\"2012\\" especially if they believe in the Mayan prophecy.<br /><br />Overall, \\"2012\\" is an action/disaster film that features non-stop action and disaster.  For those who know what to expect from Roland Emmerich, will feel that \\"2012' not only was this film his best disaster film (technically speaking), it is his best film on Blu-ray in terms of content, picture and audio quality.  This is a solid release and audiophiles, Emmerich fans and those who enjoyed \\"2012\\" will definitely enjoy.  \\"2012\\" on Blu-ray is definitely recommended!cles\\" with Adam Lambert - (2:43) Interview with \\"American Idol\\" finalist/runnerup Adam Lambert of the making of his first music video.

It's a film about humanity trying to survive apocalypse.  How does the government respond?  And sure, some may feel \\"oh, we've seen that with `Deep Impact' or `Independence Day'\\"?  But, Emmerich and Harald Kloser do a good job of taking things in a different direction.    On Blu-ray, audiophiles will simply love how the lossless soundtrack sounds on their system.  Your room just envelops with audio and directions of the sounds carefully planned and to full effect.  This is what I love about seeing this film on BD.  The picture quality is also very well done and it really brought out the details of the destruction of the world.  And of course, a lot of content, especially for those who have interest in \\"2012\\" especially if they believe in the Mayan prophecy.    Overall, \\"2012\\" is an action/disaster film that features non-stop action and disaster.  For those who know what to expect from Roland Emmerich, will feel that \\"2012 not only was this film his best disaster film (technicallyspeaking), it is his best film on Blu-ray in terms of content, picture and audio quality.  This is a solid release and audiophiles, Emmerich fans and those who enjoyed \\"2012\\" will definitely enjoy.  \\"2012\\" on Blu-ray is definitely recommended!

B0031ZWZR2|4.0|In 2009, as the popular drama series \\"LOST\\" was on hiatus until Feb. 2010 on ABC, many people were wondering what series ABC would have for viewers in the meantime.  Fortunately, the network had a new sci-fi drama series titled \\"FlashForward\\" based on the 1999 novel by Canada sci-fi writer Robert J. Sawyer set for debut in Sept. 2009 and a total of ten episodes aired through December and set for a return in March 18th after the 2010 Winter Olympics.<br /><br />So, in order to get people prepared for the second half of the series, ABC is releasing \\"Flash Forward - Part One, Season One\\" on DVD featuring the first ten episodes and will be releasing the complete series on Blu-ray and DVD later in August.  Fortunately, abc studios is including a $15 coupon with this DVD release, if people plan to upgrade to the complete series.<br /><br />The series revolves around a few main characters and what happens to them when every human in the planet loses consciousness for 2 minutes and 17 seconds.  During that time, each person was given a glimpse of their future six months later.  The FBI are trying to find out the source of why this happened, while everyone is trying to deal with what they learned of their visions of the future (good and bad).<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"FlashForward\\" is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 16×9 television.  Picture quality is good and the fact that the series is filmed in a variety of locations gives you an idea that how beautiful and vibrant this series would look in HD  on Blu-ray.  So, for those who want enjoy the series and prefer it on Blu-ray, the complete series will be available on Blu-ray in August.  For those who want the series on DVD should be happy that the picture quality is very good.  There is little compression artifacting, especially since there are five episodes on each DVD disc.<br /><br />As for audio, \\"FlashForward\\" is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The series has quite a bit of action in the ten episodes from cars crashing, gun shots, glass breaking, tables being flipped over.  As mentioned, \\"FlashForward\\" would probably sound much better via lossless on Blu-ray if you are an audiophile.  As for the DVD, the series sounds good via Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The series is front and center channel driven.  I preferred to watch the series with stereo on all channels set on my receiver for a more immersive soundscape.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"FlashForward Part One, Season One\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  * Creating Catastrophe: The Effects of Global Blackout - (7:06) The making of the blackout catastrophe from the first episode of \\"FlashForward\\". How the scene was filmed on the 110 freeway in Los Angeles with over 200 extras.<br />  * FlashForward: A Look Ahead - (4:48) A short teaser for the second half of \\"FlashForward\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />With the final season of \\"LOST\\" now airing on ABC, for quite some time, ABC has been trying to find a drama series that can capture that same magic and so far, every series within the past few years that have aired have not lasted more than a season.  I felt that \\"Lost in Mars\\" from 2008-2009 had so much potential but ABC ended the series after its first season and here we are with \\"FlashForward\\", a sci-fi drama series which features a few talent from \\"LOST\\" with a pretty cool concept and a lot of potential.<br /><br />I am enjoying the series thus far and have enjoyed the first ten episodes a lot.  I like where the series is going but the big question is if this is the type of series that can continue for multiple years.  One of the things that \\"LOST\\" has been successful is that with each hint given, there is more mystery also added in each episode.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't but nevertheless, it was enough to keep the series going for six years straight.  With \\"FlashForward\\", the main premise is the investigations to why these FlashForwards are happening and people having to deal with their own visions from the future, good and bad.<br /><br />So, far the series has done a good job by drawing the viewer in and I can imagine, if the series during its return followed \\"Lost\\" during the 10:00 p.m. Tuesday time slot, the series will do quite well.  It's a very cool series with a good amount of sci-fi, action, mystery and also a series with a lot of potential.  I really hope this series lasts more than a single season because it's very good!<br /><br />As for the DVD release, the presentation was given that \\"LOST\\" vibe with how the menus are presented on the DVD.  Although, this is more or less a release to get people up-to-date when the series returns in March,  you only get the first ten episodes on this DVD but again, people who purchase this DVD will get a $15 off coupon when they purchase the complete series on Blu-ray or DVD in August.  So, if you want to watch \\"FlashForward\\", definitely a series worth picking up now.<br /><br />Overall, \\"FlashForward\\" has turned out to be quite a riveting series and definitely a series worth watching!  I look forward to the return of the series on television in March and as for \\"FlashForward - Part One, Season One\\", if you want to know what this series is all about, then definitely pick this DVD up.

6305648522|5.0|Anyone who loves to watch movies should see this classic!  The magic and power of the cinema is beautifully portrayed through this story.  The viewer is drawn into the scenes set in this small Italian village, and feels very close to the characters and their lives.  The friendship between Toto, the young boy, and his mentor, Alfredo is particularly touching.  The technology of movie making has come a long way, but it will never surpass the skill in expressing the emotion and pathos depicted in this film!
B003AMK8IY|2.0|This episode made no sense! Why are they trying to make Chuck something he's not! Why are they trying to hook Sarah up with superman? He sucked as superman, what makes them think he would make a good spy? It looks like they are getting rid of the girl from smallville. Thank God!!! Come on people, get it together or I AM OUT!!!
B002MCJZHS|4.0|I heard the Intro on a commercial recently and had to find out what song it was.  Once I found out who it was I bought the album.  This is a really minimalist type of music.  Basically just bass, a few guitar lines and a drum machine.  Really laid back and just relaxing.  Worth buying.
0385504225|5.0|I love to read Dan Brown novels, the are intrigue and the always make me go to the encyclopedia to see if some of his writings are fiction or facts. Even though I enjoy this novel, this time I was a bit puzzle since he make the character of Robert a bit shaky, insecure and I did not have that sensation in the other books, however the twist at the end is priceless.   Over all I have to say that I like very much this book.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I just want to say that \\" The Beatles are The Beatles\\"..... I bought this excellent product and I`m really enchanted wiht it. The sound is very clear and the graphic art it is simply beatiful. The Beatles \\"in mono\\" is a great experience!!!!!!!! I bought The Beatles Stereo Box set too, but I love the mono versions instead. I`d like to have the vynil records collection remastered. I`m waiting for it........ Thanks Beatles..........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0312945973|5.0|River God: A Novel of Ancient Egypt - Few books touched my heart as much as this one.  It is well done as one is transported back and engulfed to a time in Egypt where one can truly imagine that they are there and a part of all that is happening.   Genuine enjoyment... a pleasure to read.
0061703257|2.0|This book has a great plot, which was later copied ad infinitum by numerous conspiracy theory stories. However, probably because of the times this book was written in, cliches abound. Specially, the repetition of the protagonist's devotion to his wife could have been injected in a much more realistic fashion. There are substantial passages in the book which border on ennui, which is sad given the fast paced intent of the author. In short, I am no fan of Lehane's writing - a similar theme would have been much better handled by Jonathan Kellerman, for example, IMHO.
0143038419|3.0|This is somewhat of a good journey book... as some of us are on a journey... but though I did find some of the book interesting... there came a point where I wanted to Scream at the author to STOP being so \\"Winey\\" about things she should well have gotten over... this part - repeatedly brought up in the book made the journey a hard one to get through... other than that it was a good read... but I kept wanting to tell her...\\"Get over it already and move on![[ASIN:0143038419 Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia]]\\"
B0034KHFM4|5.0|When I first heard \\"The Fame Monster\\" back in January, I immediately fell in love with the album, but was surprised to notice so many passages censored (especially considering the lyrics of other artists on the Interscope label). Of course I realized that with the follow-up to the phenomenon \\"The Fame\\", Interscope was trying to mass-market Lady Gaga to a wider audience and expose her to even wider radio airplay, but I just could not believe that an \\"explicit\\" version was nowhere to be seen. Thank Gaga it's finally here, just as the freak b**ch would want it.
1416955070|3.0|I didn't hate it. When finished, I didn't lament six hours of my life which could have been spent elsewhere, like I would if it were a truly awful book. A few of the wisecracks were funny enough that I actually laughed, and if not taken seriously, the story was moderately enjoyable at times. Even considering the faults, I think the series does have some potential to be entertaining.      Honestly though, I just did not care much about the characters, or what was happening to them. For once though, it was fortunate that I was spoiled on the plot twist at the end ahead of time, especially since it was so blatantly obvious what was going to happen after the first few chapters. If I wasn't so curious to see how it played out, I may not have bothered to finish the book at all.     I also have to agree with several of the more negative reviews in that the editing was horrendous, and the characters were very thinly veiled imitations of the primary cast from BtVS, SW & HP. So much so, that I'm surprised that this book was even published. The writing itself was amateurish and crude. For the most part, it read very much like mediocre fanfic without a beta.     Harsh as that sounds, I'm far enough into it now that I want to read the next installment for no other reason than to see if it gets any better before I give up on it completely. If nothing else, I'd like to know what Jocelyn has to say for herself and what action she might take if she ever wakes up, and what chaos will ensue if and when Valentine ever gets his hands on all the mortal instruments.    Do yourself a favor and check this one out of the library (like I did) before you buy it. If I had paid more than two bits at a garage sale for this book, I would have felt cheated. That being said, frivolous as it was, it was still fun to read. Which is really the point, after all.
0061719544|4.0|American on Purpose is a great book to read.  It was great to see Craig clean up his act and do a TV show.  He is funny to watch.  I am not too picky.  I just want to be entertained and the book did that.  I would like to see a book about what goes on behind the scenes on his show.  Perhaps that will come next.  I recommend this book.
0071636080|4.0|This book was highly recommended by a friend who makes a living giving presentations.  He said that it was the \\"most amazing book that he has read in ten years\\", adding that he \\"reads it over and over again to make sure he is prepared\\".  With that my expectations were set -- mighty high mind you -- and I ordered the book from Amazon (I figured it was pointless to ask to borrow his copy).    The book arrived on Saturday morning and I immediately tore into it.  I won't go into the outline of the book as this has already been done by many other reviewers.  What I will do, however, is give you my impressions overall.  BTW -- I blew through the book in a little over a day primarily due to the easy-going, conversational tone of the author. I found it incredibly enjoyable and very easy to pick up and resume reading (as opposed to having to remember the last points before moving forward).    Overall I felt the book was very well organized, giving me an outline for my presentations.  Gallo does, however, continually revisit the same stories over and over again, albeit from different angles, to show what Jobs was doing, what he was saying, what was on the slides behind him, and what the audience's reaction was to the action.  So, while it may seem repetitive (and it is), it is actually from a different perspective in each scene (chapter).  I don't know that this is a short-coming but do know that I got tired of hearing about the iPhone MacWorld Keynote.  By the end of the book I really did just want to jump on YouTube and watch the whole thing myself instead.    So would I recommend this book?  Probably, yes.    Do I think it is as earth shattering as my friend led me to believe?  No.    Will I reread it again?  Yes.  Maybe not in totality but certainly as a reference book.  Finally, will I incorporate Job's techniques into my next presentation?  YES!!!    I wish you the best in your presentations.
B001FB55MG|5.0|I heard thru a feiend how great this movie is for kids, and he was right! The seller's condition rating was spot on.
0756405890|5.0|I will say I'm just getting into Fantasy.  In the last few months I've probably ready 20 different fantasy books.  I don't have time to comment on books and have never done it before but this book deserves it.  I was shocked how much I enjoyed it as I couldn't put it down.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|This turntable has so much potential, to bad Sony don't know customer service.Lets review, The software sometimes does not divide the tracks. There is nothing I could find in the software or the on line users manual to change a setting to enhance this. I did, on my own, discover a way to manually create regions (track divisions) and save each track individually. This was time consuming, but effective. I had trouble with the volume of the playback on one album, I re-recorded it many times, adjusting recording levels, experimenting with several options on the menu bar to no avail. I truely believe the software is probably capable of fixing many of the problems that I had but we will never know. I went to the Sony web sight and sent them several inquiries on the problems I was having and seeing how I read everything possible I could find and the only help I got was from me and the hours I spent trying different things. Sony has a phone number where you can purchase the ability to talk to a customer service rep. Gee thanks, I just purchase your product and you want me to pay you to tell me how to use it. I find their lack of attentiveness a breach of the purchasing contract entered between a consumer and a manufacturer. I know I should have known this would have been a problem since so many others had said the same of Sony in their reviews. I watched my 30 days and exercised my return option with Amazon. I can not say enough about Amazon. They were very professional. They could sure teach Sony a little about customer service.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|I will never buy a Beatles record and regret it.  In fact, I will never buy a Beatles record for myself or anyone else at any time.  I actually never really got into the Beatles much.  I always thought that they repeated too many lines over and over again.  Songs that I actually thought were kinda catchy were too short for me as well.  I listened to my younger sister's Beatles CD's and got bored before too long.  My older sister had me listen to The Monkees and I like them a whole lot more.  I even learned that The Beatles themselves said they thought The Monkees are actually more talented than they are even though they had been competitors.  I agree.  -Just a little something to think about-
B00003CXDG|5.0|This is a very good movie. If you havn't seen this movie yet get out of your closet, and watch it. This movie is full of action, and is one of the best I have seen.

B0001VV1GK|5.0|Our two boys LOVE all things cars.  However, I was nervous about buying this garage, as it is a bit expensive, but it has been a hit.  We have now had it a year and not a day goes by that it is not played with.  It is made very well and had stood up wonderfully to the rigors of my two little ones (1 1/5 and 3).  We use only matchbox cars with it, which seems to work great.  They don't however, fit into the elevator.  This toy does not do much, so it is an ideal toy for children that are rather repetitious, easily self-entertained, or good at imaginative play.  My sons can spend hours lining up their cars and moving them around.  It was a great purchase!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is an excellent documentary.  It made me only buy organic now.  Including snacks, milk, eggs, meat etc.  It is a shame that 50+ yrs. ago you could just buy groceries but, now after this documentary, you really need to know what your food is and where it is coming from.  I feel horrible for the farmers today.  It seems like they are just puppets on a string.  To get by financially they can't farm as they did 50+ yrs. ago.  This documentary made me open my eyes and demand real old fashioned food!  The real and pure (as possible)food.  I would recommend for anyone and everyone to see this documentary.  Do we really need to put human growth hormones and antibiotics in our systems every time we sit down for a meal?  And, animals should eat what (and where) they were born to eat - not corn.
0307473708|5.0|When I picked up Darkly Dreaming Dexter and began reading I was immediately hooked. From the first page to the last it is one of a kind experience. It is dark, filled with black humor and fun to read. I always wanted to read on and see what Dark Dashing Dexter has next in mind . Somewhat I felt wrong, hoping for another murder enacted by Dex, but Jeff Linday makes the protagonist so loveable, that one can hardly judge. The plot is great and full of surprises, but what really stands out is the character of Dexter Morgan. On the outside he is an unimposing, charming forensic worker, on the inside a dark, sadistic, cold killer. On top of that Jeff Lindsay's writing is outstanding and different.    Everyone who likes novels about deranged serial killers: this is THE book to read.
B000NA2BEU|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I still loved the season overall, but compared to the first two it just didn't stand up. I'm a big Logan fan and the fact she hooks up with others in the show just didn't fly for me. Also the series finale was so disappointing, too many things left unsaid and unanswered.<br /><br />I know the writers were hoping for a renewal and that is why they went with a season finale episode and not a series finale. But the revamped version for a possible season four was fun to see in the special features.<br /><br />It's not the best season, but it's still great since it's all Veronica, baby!
B0030BYWKU|2.0|\\"Whatcha Say\\" put Jason on the map. With its slick video and catchy lyrics, I was hoping that he would be the next Big thing. There seems to be something missing here. At only 9 tracks or 40 minutes nearly all the songs try to play on the formula of Whatcha Say , but none come close to making an equal impact. Why did the record company not include \\"Part Time Lover\\" or \\"Cyber Love\\" Ft Mims on the cd? Both tracks have been viewed more than 200,000 times on Youtube and reveal a more edgier and different side. This album is in need of different genres not just all mid-tempo r'n'b which doesn't make him stand out from an already competitive crowd like Ne-Yo, Usher, etc.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|This show is just fabulous. It throws in some great characters with an X-file feel but without the aliens. I really love Olivia's character. She's tough as nails and yet sweet and sensitive. I also love it how they don't dress her up in high heels and tons of make up. She is real. She's really believable. We also get some great mysteries in each episode, great special effects.<br /><br />I also thought the actual DVD set had some great special features. Excellent show!
B002T9H2LA|1.0|No-one sane will ever understand why Hollywood insists on continuing to make movies that are downright insulting, ludicrous and unentertaining....could it be the mentality of the viewing public? Evidently, Tarantino has the same \\"tongue in cheek\\" disregard because inglorious basterds has to pertain to the paying audience and not to the storyline. Ten minutes into this movie you'll wonder where it's going and why. At the end you still won't know. My minor grandchild could make a better movie. But, Tarantino, with the IQ of a fence post,  is laughing all the way to the bank having fooled his fawning public, again. And you, will have wasted 2 1/2 hours of your life which you'll never get back....
B000A59PMO|5.0|I just love this show! It's smart and sassy and full of drama.<br /><br />We follow Veronica Mars, a smart, sassy, and funny teenage girl, who also happens to be an amateur sleuth. Her father is a private investigator and is the former sheriff. She's an outcast in the Neptune town where the rich and powerful reside on the right side of the tracks. The season takes us through snippets of why she's an outcast and the season arc is her trying to solve her best friend Lily's murder.<br /><br />Each episode adds to the story, but each episode also its own detective story. She becomes the P.I. for the school and the writing is just amazing.<br /><br />I love Veronica Mars's character. She's a high class feminist and I really enjoy seeing those roles on TV. She has flaws, etc, but that makes her human and we see plenty of flaws with her friends and family as well.<br /><br />The first season is the best!
0525421033|5.0|I knew going into this book that it would be sad. Heartbreakingly sad. Cry your eyes out sad. So I really didn't have any other expectations. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the whole story was utterly amazing!<br /><br />This book is about the ultimate tough choice. Should Mia stay and live the rest of her life without her Mother and Father and her little brother. Or should Mia let go and face the unknown just so she doesn't have to face life without the people closest to her. Mia has to make this choice while her body in lying in the ICU. She is just a invisible observer.<br /><br />To really make Mia's story more powerful the author tells her history in flashbacks. Her history with her boyfriend, with her best friend, and of course her family. All the characters in this book felt so real to me. Even the ones that died in the first 10 pages. I felt for Mia. What a terrible choice to have to make. I found myself thinking what would I do in her situation?<br /><br />Overall, this was a incredible book. I caught myself smiling throughout even with the sad topic. So don't count it out just because it's sad. It's above all a beautiful story about love and family. I highly recommend reading it!
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Second season continued the great things from the first, for the most part. The first season was just so excellent that that made it pretty hard to equal it in the second season.<br /><br />Still smart, still funny and still sassy! This season's arc focused on a bus crash, who and why. We get to see more of Wallace and Weevil. Plus Joss Whedon makes an appearance!
0316017922|5.0|I listened to this on my Ipod.  It has given me a new outlook on why so many people are so successful in life.  There is so much more than just being smart or athletic that makes someone so special or gifted.  This book does an amazing job at identifying these important ideas and shows every one of us these things.    I would recommend this book to everyone.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Excellent documentary.  So informative.  I look at food at the grocery store totally different.
B000V86OKG|3.0|I bought Dexter Season 2 in noted \\"NEW\\" condition. We received the package in a few days in the plastic wrap as it would be at the store. When watching a few of the discs it would pause and say \\"skipping over damaged area\\". After the message it would continue in with where it left off. I haven't finished all of the discs to see if there are any more problems. We did get this for a good price. Thanks.
B000Y1H7VA|5.0|Many say it's a shame that there are so much different versions of that album and it's true. The Silver Edition is almost complete and for me it's the only version I need. The album itself may not be the best the Pumpkins did, but I (still) like to listen to it. 5 stars by me.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This video has changed my life. I knew that there was a LOT going on with our foods, but to genetically engineer a soy bean so it could withstand spraying with ROUNDUP...made by a chemical company???? I am a RN and read studies daily with a site that I get on the net...and it makes sense WHY there has been a 400% increase in autism cases in the past few years now doesn't surprise me at all.   I watch every bite I eat more now and the SOURCE OF WHERE IT COMES FROM. I am fortunate to have never bought into the hydrogenated oil fad as any food that is good still sitting out days later worries me!  I live in an area that if finally organic and health food grocery conscious...FINALLY! It hasn't been always, but we did have some farmer's markets.
B000056NX5|5.0|I would have to say this dvd is great.  Very enjoyable. Singing is great. I think I like this format better than the movie version because it's like a stage show on television.  It's not the traditional way to tell the story but the story is still there and should not turn people off because of that.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|the movie would have been a complete waste of time had it not been for this beautiful, and totally unique, soundtrack. it has a combination of songs. some heart wrenching and soulful. then there is the silly \\" hoover, fixer, sucker, guy\\" clip that really sounds like they were having fun making the album. SO worth it!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|The Item was exactly what I wanted and came in a quick manor.  I hope I might buy more stuff from the seller.
1405235950|4.0|In the opening few pages of this, the 11th work in the Mr Man series, we are almost led to expect of Hargreaves a foray into dialectical materialism.<br /><br />We meet Mr Uppity with his top hat and monocle - a clear and overt representation of the bourgeois industrialist. Other arriviste trappings such as his long limousine and imposing townhouse further give the game away.<br /><br />In a thinly-veiled reference to the oppression of the workers by the ruling class, we are told that Mr Uppity is rude to everyone, and the detail that he has no friends in Bigtown explicitly informs us that the masses are on the brink of revolution. Are we about to bear witness to class war, Hargreaves-style? To see Mr Uppity brought to account by the revolutionary power of the proletariat? Vanquished and overthrown by the party of the workers?<br /><br />Not so. Mr Uppity is no Marxian analysis, no Leninist prescription for class action. As always, Hargreaves' inherent and essential conservatism comes to bear. His critique of the bourgeoisie comes not from the proletariat but from the feudal aristocracy. It is the authority of a king that places limits upon Mr Uppity's excesses, as his usurpation and arbitrary exercise of power has violated 'the natural order of things'. Hence the protection the masses are dealt in response to this transgression is paternal, and they receive it as subjects not radical agents of change.<br /><br />Being so staunch a traditionalist, Hargreaves of necessity is a reformer not a revolutionary. The King does not have Mr Uppity executed, imprisoned or even sent into exile. There is no state seizure and collectivization of his wealth, or in fact any redistribution at all. (Despite his pomp and grandeur, the King no longer has such powers - both the outward self-importance and ultimate weakness of his intervention appear little more than a face-saving exercise for his waning hereditary rule.)<br /><br />Rather, in the end it is the mildest of all regulation that is imposed upon the capitalist class. The ownership of the means of production remains the same, with no fundamental change to the economic base - just some superstructural tinkering to rein-in any overly brutal treading on the small man. The ruling class can do pretty much as it did before, as long as it says 'please' and 'thank you'. The aristocracy is duly appeased.<br /><br />Hence we arrive at the Britain Hargreaves lived in - a gently regulated capitalism coupled with sham aristocracy, maintained by our own collective nostalgia and a national lack of appetite for mass action.class.

0843174218|5.0|If '1984' or 'The Trial' had been a children's book, Mr Messy would be it. No literary character has ever been so fully and categorically obliterated by the forces of social control. Hargreaves may well pay homage to Kafka and Orwell in this work, but he also goes beyond them.<br /><br />We meet Mr Messy - a man whose entire day-to-day existence is the undiluted expression of his individuality. His very untidiness is a metaphor for his blissful and unselfconscious disregard for the Social Order. Yes, there are times when he himself is a victim of this individuality - as when he trips over a brush he has left on his garden path - but he goes through life with a smile on his face.<br /><br />That is, until a chance meeting with Mr Neat and Mr Tidy - the archetypal men in suits. They set about a merciless programme of social engineering and indoctrination that we are left in no doubt is in flagrant violation of his free will. 'But I like being messy' he protests as they anonymize both his home and his person with their relentless cleaning activity, a symbolism thinly veiled.<br /><br />This process is so thorough that by the end of it he is unrecognizable - a homogenized pink blob, no longer truly himself (that vibrant Pollock-like scribble of before). He smiles the smile of a brainwashed automaton, blandly accepting what he has been given no agency to question or refuse. It is in this very smile that the sheer horror of what we have seen to occur is at its most acute.<br /><br />Somewhere behind this blank expression though is a latent anger - a trace of self-knowledge as to what he once was - in the barbed observation he makes to Neat and Tidy that they have even deprived him of his name.<br /><br />The book ends with a dry reminder from Hargreaves that just as with the secret police in some totalitarian regime, our own small expressions of uniqueness and volition may also result in a visit from these sinister suited agents.
B001UV4XWY|5.0|Wow, all these bad reviews are just one obvious sign of the dull and heartless minds of the new communistic generation. The freaking funniest part is, you are so stupid and self righteous you cant even see the real plot behind the movie. What? its religious? because the women always press the button? Thats it? Thats as far as you can think? You FOKING liberals are so self absorbed you failed to see your very own ideals that the movie was drowned in.     You LIBERALS!! Unbelievable. Let me enlighten you.    \\"Mankind must make sacrifices for the greater good or they should be forced to.\\"    Sound familiar??    Is that not the very agenda of your communist president, Mr OBMAMA? and the rest of you Liberal/Progressives?    God teaches \\"Freedom\\" above all! There may always be consequences to your actions, but you are FREE to CHOOSE for your self.  This movie had nothing to do with God. Those people were forced to make choices.    I know what I ought to do. Im gonna go around and kill anyone who claims to be a liberal. Ill call it \\"MY sacrifice for the greater good.\\"    Anger? YES!!  You want to enslave me for my own good!!!  Yes! it pisses me off!!    And Yet I actually liked the movie. Very thought provoking.
0843175621|5.0|An infant's primer in Existentialism, we find in this book a weighty treatise on the personal politics of agency and empowerment, taking ownership and authorship of one's own life.<br /><br />Such is the force with which this Heideggerian hero is hurled into the world that he has not stopped bouncing since. This is Mr Bounce's facticity - the set of circumstances, both of himself and his environment, in which he finds himself as a subjectivity. That is, his ceaseless bouncing is the hand that life has dealt him, owing to his unique position in time, in history, as a conscious being in a sensory world.<br /><br />The phrase above is the key to this tale - 'he finds himself as a subjectivity'. In the early stages of the story, his experience is more that of an object as he randomly bounces his way through his life, exerting next to no control. It is important to be aware, as ever with Hargreaves, that this is not merely a matter of the physical, the material. The most crucial passage of this masterwork is where Mr Bounce is beaten around like a tennis ball by two players who appear to lack any concept of his personhood. This is just as we are all to some extent shunted to and fro by the whims and vagaries of das Man, The They - the unthinking, amorphous collective abnegation of Will. Here we confront Bad Faith - inauthentic existence.<br /><br />Unlike many though, perhaps due to his particularly vivid and immediate experience of this phenomenon, Mr Bounce is spurred into action. In a visit to a doctor (of philosophy?), Mr Bounce is presented with the perfect solution - a pair of heavy boots.<br /><br />Acknowledging his facticity he also transcends it, through choice - the active exercise of free will. Newly grounded in the uniqueness of his being, his bouncing ceases - the emancipatory conclusion of this work is the achievement of agency, authentic being.
0887307280|4.0|This book starts out strong. The author explains a concepts and then summaries it via conversation with the fictitious pie shop owner. The writing style is very very fluffy. I'll give an example. Instead of saying:    \\"Technicians rely on managers who rely on the entrepreneur to get the job done\\"    He would say something like:    \\"Technicians require a manager to perform their duties to the highest level. If they are not producing at the highest level they will eventually not perform at any level and you will lose them. And without technicians your managers will not perform their duties to the highest level; and if they are not producing at the highest level they will eventually not perform at any level and you will lose them as well. Finally, without managers, the entrepreneur cannot produce at the highest level; and if the entrepreneur can't perform at the highest level, he or she will eventually not perform at any level which will effectively render the entrepreneur useless; and if the entrepreneur is useless, the business will be irreparably harmed and will eventually fail.\\"    Now of course I didn't use a real quote from the book, but you can see how with that writing style a simple concept gets ballooned into a bunch of empty and often repeated words. At first you can live with it because it gives you time to think about what he is saying while he is fluffing everything up. But by the end of the book the concepts become less and less useful and putting up with the fluff become a chore.    I still give it 4 stars because I think majority of the concepts are great and helpful. I just wish he would be more poignant in his delivery.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|Annie Lennox really has the formula down pat. Write your own songs, keep your style intact and sing within a range that makes each song a personal moment.  I love the fact that she feels no need to release a new disc every 9 months and that she waits till she has the goods.   Such a unique woman.  It is difficult to imagine anyone else covering these songs. She knows herself and her music.  I actually think that this may be her most consistent effort yet. \\"Dark Road\\" and especially \\"Lost\\" are easily my favorite tracks, with the latter bordering on classic.
0812979656|5.0|... you'll love TGOST.  Parts of this book sent chills down my spine.  As in her political writings and speeches, Roy has a gift for tugging at your sense of injustice in literature as well.      Don't read this if you want an uplifting rosey picture that will put a smile on your face and a warm feeling in your heart.  This is not that kind of story.  But in a stark gutwrenching way, it is perfect, beautiful.    One thing to point out is Roy has a very unique narrative writing style.  Irony and sarcasm are in no short supply.  If you've heard her speak, you can easily hear the narration in her voice, and it makes it that much more beautiful.  This juxtaposed with the books dark subject matter makes for kind of bitter irony I can't get enough of.

Not a history lesson.  No sexy examples.  Little mention of the titans.  Yet the point of doing math, its constraints and pathways, would strike anyone who reads the book.

B00280LYIC|5.0|I was not a fan of mythology in school, but I really enjoyed this book.  It's similar to Harry Potter, yet set in such a different world, it is nothing like the content in Potter.  Truly a different book set in a unique world, but if you enjoyed the Potter series you will probably enjoy this.      I devoured the book over a weekend on my iPhone Kindle app and on the Kindle2.  It's a short, easy read but don't let that fool you.  You'll be reading book 2 in no time.    The Kindle store worked smoothly and no issues with downloading or the transfer of content.    **A note for those of you who watched the motion picture - the movie is faithful to the book in IDEAS, but vastly different in CONTENT.  I enjoyed both and the movie did a nice job squeezing the story into 2-hours.  However, don't think for a second that if you watched the movie you don't need to read the book.  That is especially true if you read book 2.  If you only watched the movie The Lightning Thief, then tried reading book 2 - you would wonder what on earth happened in book 1.**
B002W1HBN4|3.0|I looked forward to owning this 25th Anniversary cd / dvd package because, as someone who owned the original cd, I expected remastered sound and lots of bonus features. But after listening to the cd and watching the dvd, I was left disappointed.    First the cd: I owned both the \\"Whitney Houston\\" and \\"Whitney\\" cds in the 1980s and I must say that in terms of sound quality, the first one was inferior to her second cd which had great sound and a very high recording level. Thus, when I bought this 25th anniversary cd, I expected an improved sound quality compared to the original but I was still left wanting for more in terms of sound improvement. This is even made more glaring when the bonus remixes come in at the end of the cd and the recording level of these remixes are so high up there when compared to the original album songs.    Second, the dvd. The live versions of \\"You Give Good Love\\" and \\"I Am Changing\\" are the only new performances in this dvd. Whitney's performance of \\"Home\\" and the videos contained in this dvd have all been seen in her Greatest Hits Compilation dvd. Maybe it would have been better if all her never-been-seen performances were just included in this dvd since I am sure most of her fans already own copies of the other videos.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I thought I knew a lot about the subject of food in this country, but this movie really opened my eyes further that I had anticipated.  Most people probably don't even want to watch this movie because they don't want to know the truth, but that's just it - this is our reality and we're kidding ourselves if we stay in the dark.    Anyway, after seeing this movie, I no longer have any desire to eat meat unless I know exactly where it came from and how it was raised, which is really expensive (even in a Northern California, farm town with plenty of sustainable and organic farms).  So, watching this movie has proved the best diet, since I no longer look at food as casually as I once did.    Spoiler Alert! I think the most enlightening part of the movie for me was seeing how skewed our food purchasing system has become that fresh vegetables are more expensive than Sugary soda and hamburgers. Weren't meat and sugar supposed to be the expensive items?  Well they are, but thanks to subsidies, poorer Americans are basically force fed crap until they get diabetes or a heart attack.     Oh, I could go on, just watch the movie, you won't be the same afterwords, but, you owe it to yourself to know the truth.

B0019LY5IM|5.0|In more ways than one, Lost Season 5 is the best season of one of the greatest shows ever to air on television. It had all the elements that have come to define the show, and make it one of the most enjoyable experiences ever to hit TV. It had great character development, it had great mythology, it had great moments, it was original, and it had a superb story. And let me start off by saying that I'm a time-travel geek. I lay awake at night in fear of time paradoxes and my life being erased. I've also seen most major & obscure takes on the subject, so I followed and understood the whole season with the information that was given. I can see how somebody would get lost easily, but I understood it perfectly, and that's just because of my geekiness. Your experience with Season 5 may vary.<br /><br />Highlight Episodes:<br />The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham<br />LaFleur<br />Namaste<br />Dead Is Dead<br />The Incident<br /><br />First off, the characters. Ever since Season 1, Lost has struggled with bringing new emotions, and stories that seem like they fit with the character, and not for any cheap or uninteresting side-note or plot device; that is if they even move the characters along. In Season 5, this is not the case, every character matures in a totally different way than we've seen before, and it does them justice. This is especially the case with Sawyer, who after 5 Seasons has finally granted my wish of wanting to see him in a leadership role. But he's no leader like any we've seen on the show before, and he's certainly no Jack. He's still the cool, nickname guy we knew before, but this is a Sawyer that uses his brain for somebody other than himself, and he just does it in some have called a \\"Winston Churchill\\" type manner. And this description would suit him well. We finally found a stable relationship for Sawyer, and for a long while there, he was one of the few characters on the show that had found some sense of happiness. Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sayid & Sun also progressed well from off-island life to island life, giving each of the characters a real reason to return that again suited their characters well. Heck, even Kate or Jack didn't seem annoying for a while there. Then of course, we saw Miles & Faraday grow into their roles on the show, as they became not only essential to the story, but they found a way into our likability circle. Sure, they may have came late, but especially in the case of Miles now, he fits right in.<br /><br />Story-wise, the season does start off a bit slow do to the whole 'We're Getting The Band Back Together' storyline. Sure it was essential, but it felt like it could have been condensed a bit. But that only lasts for a few episodes, and they're usually inter-spliced with the time-travel story (More on Time-travel later). But once everybody got onto the island, it just rocketed down the path of no return with each episode being slammed-packed with great moments & stuff we've never seen before. Keeping the show on the island, but moving it mostly to the 70s was a great change of pace for the season, and it was fun living in the Dharma world for a little bit, getting to know the characters, events & the company that shaped the island so much, even though we wished Radzinsky had bit the bullet early from the moment he started opening his mouth. But overall, I couldn't have been much more satisfied with the arch the season took, and it did a nice job of setting up the final season.<br /><br />As for the time-travel, I was stunned how the show took it in such an amazing/original direction. I mean, the whole island moves in time, stays in one spot for a while, then takes the castaways to another time period. And some of the stops are pretty amazing. We get to see the island in the 50s, the future, the 80s, and other various unknown points, and what the castaways usually found in these periods was just so fun for any Lost fan. I mean, the moment where the island skips in time, and a rope once dangling from a well was just sticking out of the ground since the well hadn't been built yet. So awesome. But that's not all folks, they presented time travel theories, created the time-loop timeline, and dived deep into the question of 'Can you change the past, or is what done is done? If you try to change the past, do you just eventually set it on its present course?' These are deep questions, and it was just so fun to watch Lost tread ground that most other media hasn't even touched on, much less delved into.<br /><br />Overall, time will tell its true placement in the series' hierarchy, but for me, it was one of the most fun and satisfying experiences watching TV in my lifetime. Sure, it's not for everybody, and it is hard to get a grip on it, but for those that can (and it certainly helps to watch all the episodes in a short span of time), then you might be half as keen to love it as I do. And what about those last 30 seconds? One of the best cliffhangers in TV history, especially if you have the chance to pop in the next episode right afterwards? I say yes.since the well hadn't been built yet. So awesome.

B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|Alright, I've heard many good reviews of Ponyo and a few negative ones. I can definitely see what there is to like, because there is much, but I also see where the film could have fallen short in the eyes of many viewers. I am not a strong fan of anime, but my friends are. I do like anime though; I think many artists and storytellers have achieved great things through their works in anime but, for me, nothing compares to the works of Hayao Miyazaki. He seems to capture a magic in his visuals paired with his song choices and overall tone. I am a huge fan of Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Howl's Moving Castle, and I have become a fan of Ponyo. The reason I give this movie four stars is not because I do not like it, but because I felt it wasn't as strong as Miyazaki's other films. The four stars is based on a comparison which I probably should not even have made. This is why I say: if you're buying Ponyo because you love Miyazaki and you love the intricate details in the storytelling as well as the epic storyline (like Princess Mononoke), you will not get it here. This movie is more contained, simpler. Does that make it a bad movie? Heck no! On the contrary, Ponyo's simplicity is what makes it so great. It is the kind of movie that tells a simple enough story, but manages to bombard your eyes with beautiful, colorful images that are not simplistic in any way. I do recommend this movie; but don't do what I did: don't go in there expecting a two hour epic anime like Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, because it is not those movies. Allow yourself to be taken in and don't expect too much, because sometimes too much is not a good thing. Ponyo is just enough. Enjoy!

I understand the scandals that have arisen about possible plagiarism, but Kearns Goodwin writes great history. In this book, she not only gives detailed stories of the lives of these great men and their families. She also probes the motivation of the men who are the characters in the book and the issues that controlled the political climate of the period from 1840 to 1860.   But Kearns Goodwin gives us much more even than this. She takes you to the era about which she writes. She tells you what clothes were being worn, what was for sale in the stores, how influential newspapers of the time were and how dirty train rides were.  Pick up this book and take yourself back to the 1850s and live the lives these great men lived.

B001HN69B8|4.0|THE IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS<br /><br />STARRING: Heath Ledger, Christopher Plummer, Andrew Garfield, Tom Waits, Lily Cole, Verne Troyer, Colin Farrell, Johnny Depp and Jude Law<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Terry Gilliam<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Science Fiction / Fantasy<br />Release Date: 08 January 2010<br />Review Date: 31 January 2010<br /><br />I've always found Heath Ledger and Johnny Depp to look similar, and thought it would be neat to see them play brothers. Obviously with the un-expected death of Heath Ledger, we will never see that happen. We can at least however, see them play the same character in the newest and last film of Ledger's life: The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer co-stars as the magnificent Doctor Parnassus. He's an old-timer with a two-bit sideshow act that he barely seems content with. And when I say old-timer, I mean old. He's made a deal with the devil you see, that upon her 16th birthday, his daughter's soul will belong to the devil, granting Parnassus the gift of immortality. He made this deal, years before the birth of his daughter; but he made it nonetheless.<br /><br />All may not be lost for him however, when the devil (Tom Waits), offers him a new challenge. They will both attempt to collect the souls of five unfortunates, in just two days; the amount of time before his daughter turns 16.<br /><br />Desperate to keep her on earth with him, the old man regrettably agrees to the bet and the clock starts ticking. It's by sheer magic that Doctor Parnassus will be able to claim these five souls. All he has to do is get five people to willingly step into his `Imaginarium'; a curtain of sorts, onboard his portable side-show trolley. The `Imaginarium' is a kind of mystical dream-world that is different for all who enter.<br /><br />Parnassus sets hard at work with his crew of co-stars: his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole); the young man, who is infatuated with her, Anton (Andrew Garfield); and of course the mysterious Tony, played primarily by Ledger.<br /><br />We meet Ledger's character Tony in the most unpleasant and ironic of ways. He appears to be dead, hanging by the neck from a bridge. It will no-doubt put many in an uncomfortable place. He is magically revived and claims to have no memory of who he is or from where he hails. The team of small-time entertainers is in agreement that he can repay them for saving his life by joining their act. Tony accepts the invitation.<br /><br />All of the actors in the film deliver great performances and are a lot of fun to watch. You will laugh a lot too. This is not a great movie by any means, but it is a good one; especially if you take into consideration how extraordinarily well it was put together.<br /><br />Ledger passed away on 22 January 2008, leaving his co-stars and crew with the film only two thirds completed. Whatever were they to do? Co-writer and director Terry Gilliam (who had worked with Ledger previously on another good movie - The Brothers Grimm), had a great task ahead of him. He decided to make Ledger's character Tony into a shape shifter.<br /><br />By divine chance, they were able to transform the missing pieces of the film around the ones with Ledger, with the help of some Hollywood big-shots; Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell, to be exact. They all volunteered to act out the missing pieces of the story that requiring Tony. They could not have done it any better if they tried. The film plays out beautifully with all four actors, playing the same character in different stages of the story.<br /><br />Johnny Depp looks so much like Heath Ledger, there is one shot in the film that I'm not sure which one of them it is. Look for it and see if you can tell. It's the shot of Tony atop of the trolley after his first transformation into - the Johnny Depp version of himself. Depp perfected Ledger's character terrifically and it puts a smile on your face, knowing he stepped up to do this.<br /><br />Jude Law plays the second transformation and surprisingly enough, also looks like Ledger somewhat! He too played the character as Ledger would have and it's a treat to watch.<br /><br />But the biggest surprise to me came from Colin Farrell. Next to Ledger, he spends the longest time as Tony, and he blew me away with his performance. Knowing that he has a very thick Irish accent to cover up, it is astonishing at how similar his speech pattern was to that of Ledger's. He moves like Ledger, he looks like him and all of his facial expressions and physical mannerisms are dead-on. He is very deserving of a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.<br /><br />I liked Heath Ledger when I first saw him in 10 Things I Hate about You. But when I saw him in The Patriot, I knew he had a bright future ahead of him and I became an instant fan.

He too played the character as Ledger would have and it's a treat to watch.      But the biggest surprise to me came from Colin Farrell. Next to Ledger, he spends the longest time as Tony, and he blew me away with his performance. Knowing that he has a very thick Irish accent to cover up, it is astonishing at how similar his speech pattern was to that of Ledger's. He moves like Ledger, he looks like him and all of his facial expressions and physical mannerisms are dead-on. He is very deserving of a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.      I liked Heath Ledger when I first saw him in 10 Things I Hate about You. But when I saw him in The Patriot, I knew he had a bright future ahead of him and I became an instant fan.

0810983915|5.0|Greg Heffley is a good person. To prove it, he kicks off<br />the book with his New Years' resolution of helping people<br />improve. He starts by telling his mother that she should<br />eat her potato chips more quietly. Many other incidents<br />such as this bring Greg's father to think of military<br />school, which he considers a great way to make Greg more<br />manly. The book ends just as summer is about to begin,<br />setting the stage for the sequel \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid:<br />Dog Days\\".<br /><br />This was a hilarious book! The author's style<br />of incorporating humor into Greg's reasoning was something<br />that made me laugh out loud every time! Greg's character<br />was self-absorbed yet lovable and you couldn't help but<br />laugh at almost anything he said. The journal format of<br />the book was entertaining and it was a very quick read.

B001HNE3NO|3.0|The majority of our book club members didn't know about the events in Paris 1942 so we were overwhelmingly appalled by the atrocities which occurred during the Vel d'Hiv round-up. The author's vivid descriptions of the conditions in the Vel D'Hiv reveal not only the horror but also the many human reactions (good and bad) of all the participants. Our book club had a lively discussion about the Vichy government, collaboration and on a more personal note, the personality traits and displays of character by Sarah's parents. AND ... we all agreed that the contemporary time story fell short and disappointed us in many ways. The appearance of Sarah's son and Julia's connection to him were the last in a long line of trite and coincidental events that marred the contemporary time story. BUT ... if your book club is looking for a book that will spark discussion, read Sarah's Key.
B001B2KUIS|4.0|When Clapton was with the Yardbirds he quit before they released their first album \\"For Your Love\\" in protest for the more commercial-sounding material - a departure from mainstream blues ala what he did with John Mayall - of most of the tracks on that album.  Somewhat in a blessing in disguise, his actions allowed for my favourite guitarist of all time, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page to get involved with Page later on morphing the remnants of The Yardbirds into what eventually became Led Zeppelin.  So given how it all turned out I forgive Clapton's naivety/arrogance as now in what almost smacks of hyprocrisy or perhaps maturity of adulthood Clapton releases an album that is even more syrupy/commercial than \\"For Your Love\\" ever was!<br /><br />Still, that said, this is a very good album and although not as rewarding for me personally as was his work with Cream as being a guitarist myself I was more impressed with his incredible guitar stylings then and even with the Yardbirds (check out the guitar solos on \\"I Ain't Got You\\" and \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\" for instance - absolutely inspired stuff!) but still moving on to the relative simplicity of his playing on \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" this is clearly meant to reach out to a wider audience than what he had during those early days and he succeeds very well with the tracks here.  Long gone are the extended virtuoso guitar solos but we do get to see Clapton's vastly improving songwriting skills here although there are still quite a few covers (4 out of the 9 tracks are covers).<br /><br />This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version is a slightly mixed bag though as although it has been remastered the sound quality is good but not great but this could be a result of a poorly preserved master.  There are also 2 foldout inserts containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.  The mlps design itself is very good and while not the best design that I've seen is still pretty well done and is not the worst that I've seen.<br /><br />Overall a decent mlps version of a decent Clapton album and a worthwhile addition to your sonic library.<br /><br />Recommended!ent mlps version of a decent Clapton album and a worthwhile addition to your sonic library.

B001AVCFK6|4.0|I love this movie and it's great in Blu-ray.  What wasn't great was a lot of the extra stuff.  The virtual ship...about 3 minutes of interesting.  I can't get the Free Demo on-line game to work at all...looks like its for Play Station or something.  There is a free digital download to your computer which works 1 time only, so be careful when you try that.  Commentaries are good and video extras are fun.  I have this because it is a piece of movie history.  If I weren't such a Star Trek fan, I'd have been better off renting it.

B002C6A6N6|5.0|This movie pkg turned out to be all I hoped for. Excellant quality. Anyone who is a Dr. Quinn fan would thoughly enjoy this set in their library. The price was exceptional for the 6 seasons as while as the two additional movies included in this set a total of 42 DVDs. It was shipped very well and comes in a nice neat box for easy storage in keeping all DVDs together.  If you would like a good family story set in the nineteenth century this is for you. Doctors, orphans, early Indian relations with settlers, frontier town life, how people used to help one another in times of trouble even if they didnt get along in day to day living is all in these movies.

We see how an industry dominated by a few players may be offering less healthy food, poor living environments for animals, and unsanitary practices.

0316010669|5.0|In this well-written and easy-to-read book, Malcolm Gladwell explores the ways our first impressions and judgments are formed. It approaches this theme from both the positive and negative points of view, showing how oftentimes our first instinct can be the correct one even when the evidence seems to show something different, while at other times our snap judgments can be based on faulty physiological and socially-conditioned mechanisms. Gladwell includes examples from a variety of disiplines, from science and war to marketing and the arts. Some reviewers have criticized the author for not providing more of science to validify his theory. However, Gladwell is not a scientist, and he is not attempting to posit a new and wide-ranging theory for the world to accept. Gladwell's strength is in making the science of everyday concepts accessible and applicable for readers who may not otherwise read about such a topic. The book succeeds in making the reader question and think about the conclusions we reach - both in the heat in the moment and after conscious deliberation. He also offers potential guidelines for deciding when each is preferrable. Some of the issues he probes are of vital importance in how individuals and institutions make decisions in a variety of fields, which makes his book of great importance as well as of great interest.<br /><br />On a personal note, I found this book to intersect very nicely with some of my own research into the role of technique and structure in creativity, improvisation, and flow. The real-life examples Gladwell provides definitely make the topic engaging and alive, which I believe is very necessary in getting important messages across in a way that is accessible to people from a variety of backgrounds and education levels. So as a researcher and as a writer, I found Gladwell's book to be very valuable.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Even though this film is in Japanese  this will not make any differents  you will see the emotions of the characters'  and know what they are feeling .Director Yojiro Takita and writer Kundo Koyama examine the rituals surrounding death in Japan with this tale of an out-of-work cellist who accepts a job as a \\"Nokanashi\\" or \\"encoffineer\\" (the Japanese equivalent of an undertaker) in order to provide for himself and his young wife. Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) is a talented musician, but when his orchestra is abruptly disbanded, he suddenly finds himself without a source of steady income. Making the decision to move back to his small hometown, Daigo answers a classified ad for a company called \\"Departures,\\" mistakenly assuming that he will be working for a travel agency. Upon discovering that he will actually be preparing the bodies of the recently deceased for their trip to the afterlife, Daigo accepts the position as gatekeeper between life and death and gradually gains a greater appreciation for life. But while Daigo's wife and friends universally despise his new line of work, he takes a great amount of pride in the fact that he is helping to ensure that the dead receive a proper send-off from this state of being. - Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide I do highly recommend this film

B001FB4W0C|2.0|I had been eagerly awaiting the release of this season's DVD but when I watched it I was VERY disappointed!!   I will think twice before I purchased any subsequent seasons.  The writing and the stories (especially the one with the \\"stuffed teddy bear\\" were of a lower caliber and dismal in comparison to the previous seasons.      The only highlight in my opinion, was when \\"Dean' is singing (lip synching) on the top of a car (I don't think this was a part of the written material) but it was hysterical and very well performed!
0307408833|1.0|I made the vanilla cupcakes and the chocolate cupcakes. The vanilla tasted terrible. The GB flour taste was strong in them. I then made the chocolate cupcakes again these were not great either though better than the vanilla. The frostings are decent but really taste of coconut and they do not set (they are very runny) as other people have mentioned. It makes sense really that Erin McKenna wouldn't reveal her true recipes for the bakery. I have been vegan for years and have baked gluten free on and off for awhile and I look for recipes that taste like the real thing. With all the hype that surrounded this book I thought these would be awesome but so far they taste like vegan, dairy free cupcakes from the early 90's when people didn't know how good vegan and gluten free diets can be. This book is mainly for show and has little substance.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is one of the best kid movies I've seen.  It's so good, that viewing it can actually be tolerated by adults repeatedly! Our picks in movies have to be attitude-minimum, since my little one picks up on it and imitates.  The 'tude in \\"Cars\\" characters is shown to be unacceptable behavior to other characters.  The soundtrack is well-done, featuring a nice array of old, and remade and new songs.  It's also free of sing-song tunes, which grate the nerves if you happen to want to watch movies with your children or just be in the same house while they watch!  My only negative comment is that Lightning yells \\"hillbilly hell\\" once and I don't want my child repeating that.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I was a senior in high school when this album came out and I knew right off this was a different sound all together than zz top,bad company and the other rockers of th 70's. This is one of those albums where every song is good and you just want to crank it up and 35 years later it's still good ! I've heard the die hard zepplin fans dog this group but its like comparing apples to oranges, there different just enjoy it. The song foreplay-long time builds up to one of the great feel good intro's of any song of all time and I can remember crusin main street in my old chevy van (hey it was the 70's) having a party to that song, I just wish someone would come out with this sound again and let the younger generation see what feel good music was all about.
0312370849|2.0|I'm torn between giving this a 2 or a 3. I don't usually rate books below a 3. There are a lot of fiction books out there that center around the atrocities of WWII. And I believe that if you are going to tackle a small area in this genre, its needs to be good. I was at least glad that it broached and area that we don't see much and that was occupied France. This book unfortunately fell short, very short. I read this book for a book club and I found it to be mostly unbelievable in many areas. There were also too many coincidences and things happening 'just because'. Sarah's story, had it been developed by the writer better could have been amazing. But instead we lose Sarah's voice to Julia who was completely unlikable and I almost felt she wasn't believable if she were a real person. Even the daughter Zoe to me seemed totally unbelievable. The writing to me seemed amateur. I can complain about lack of real character development but then again, I'm almost glad because had this book been any longer it would have been put aside and not completed. Unfortunately, this is the end of the road for me and this author; I will not read future books by her. Want to read a good WWII book, read The Book Thief or Skeletons at the Feast. I enjoyed those much more immensely than this book.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I had recently ordered the collection and received it about 2 weeks ago.  Best move I did.  I am having such a delightful time watching this show.  I had seen it from the beginning on TV up until 2005. Don't remember why, but I thought it was over with Rory going to College.  Must be a case of old brain cells. Now at 66 I am enjoying to see what happened in the next 3 years.  This show brings back such memories of my own past with having my first daughter at 17 and growing up with her.  I like the packaging because I can put the \\"suitcase\\" anywhere I want to, without stacking up the DVDs all over my shelves.  And for the price I paid,  it seemed a very good deal,  which I always get when ordering from Amazon.com.  Not sucking up here, just love this place and have now bought many Collections here,  and have not had any problems at all. But this is a great Collection and for anyone who wants to get away from all the bad news for at least a few hours a day,  this is the fun and Zany way to do it!!! So excuse me please, time for the next DVD.

B00168OIOE|5.0|It was February first of two thousand ten when I recieved my copy of Disney/Pixar's MONSTERS, INC. and I--as I said in my Packaging Feedback--was very impressed. Disney's transfer of the film to Blu-ray was excelent: the picture was sharp, colorful, and clear. James Sullivan's fur was very realistic and the DTS-HD 5.1 surround sound was amazing. The film itself is one of my favorite Pixar films and in my opinion, MONSTERS, INC. is one of the films with the best ending. If you have a little one, or just liked to watch movies, I recommmend MONSTERS, INC. for your enjoyment and for its beautiful High Definition picture and sound. This film will leave you satisfied and happy.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I had been waiting to see this movie, and I finally got the chance when I went to the theatre. I have these things to say:<br /><br />Don't ignore the one star review that complains of the use of dark magic. There is dark magic in the film, but it is not \\"half of the whole movie\\" and there are no incantations, chants or anything, just a lively song. Most of the young kids I've seen had no problem coping with this, and my family adored the movie inspite of the magic element.( This is coming from someone with a deeply religious family). In short, unless your child is very sensitive and might be frightened this is nothing to worry about.<br /><br />The characters in this film are realistic and well rounded, If they don't start out that way they are quickly brought down to earth. The theme of Princesses living happily ever after with the help of the forces that be and without any effort on their part is destroyed. Unlike Cinderella, Snow White, Or Princess Jasmine, Princess Tiana works for everything she gains in lieu of having a fairy godmother or some other convienience. A good theme for young children.<br /><br />Yet another good fact is that most of the characters don't get what they initially WANT in the end, but what they NEED. and they find themselves to be a lot happier.<br /><br />This movie is also very comical, particularly the protagonist's best friend, Whose witty, clueless comments and actions can even make adults laugh.<br /><br />Overall this film is an iconic masterpiece I can't wait to purchase it when it comes out, and I highly reccomend it.

No, it isn't. It's about sex.<br /><br />Still others have dubbed it \\"feminist\\". Come on, you don't really think feminist activists are watching this trash, are you?<br /><br />Even from a sexist angle, the show is a failure. I mean, the women in the show are ugly. Especially Carrie. Curiously, some of the men are more good-looking! Not to mention the trannies.<br /><br />The only positive thing one could say about \\"Sex and the City\\" is that with this original, you really don't need the parodies.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|It was cheaper to buy the 4 disk than the two disk. The subtitles do work in the four disk. Also includes the adorable shorts.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I liked it a lot. At first I thought it would be a documentary written with a vegan intensity(you know, angry, blaming, condemming and invasive), but it's not. It really did open my eyes and my wife and I are much more conscious of our food and our \\"votes\\" in the supermarket.
B00003CXA6|4.0|This film is very historically correct (I live in south central Pennsylvania and have visited the battlefield many times).  The casting and acting are superb.  The scenery is breathtaking.  However, the DVD version is manufactured on a strange double-sided long play disc.  So, you have to remove the DVD at mid-point in the movie and flip it over.  Also, the DVD does not alway synchronize the sound track properly on the second side, so you sometimes have to restart it a couple of times to get it to sync.  Assuming that the original master film is of sufficient quality (it should be since the companion film, Gods and Generals, has been released in Blu-ray, and it was prior in time), a Blu-ray release of Gettysburg would indeed be a historical treasure.  Additionally, a Blu-ray release would eliminate the troublesome need to manually flip over the disc to see the remainder of the movie, since a Blu-ray disc would have more than sufficient capacity on the single side of a disc.  The Blu-ray version would also provide greater capacity for auxiliary tracks and greater sound depth.  I sure hope that someone persuades the film maker to release a Blu-ray version, and if they did, I would buy it immediately, even though I already own the DVD version.
1594488843|5.0|What really drives people to perform at their best? According to Daniel Pink, far too many managers rely on the carrot/stick approach to motivate employees. He cites substantial scientific research that shows that these approaches are outmoded and simply do not work for many types of work in the modern economy. In fact, the carrot or stick approach can actually diminish workers' performance over time. (The notable exception is that these approaches can be effective for workers who do routine, repetitive tasks, that require little creativity or individual initiative.) Pink shows that for many types of work, money is not the most powerful incentive. He shows that paying expected bonuses can actually diminish productivity, creativity, and performance over time.    Drive's main point is that the most effective way to motivate people is to pay them fairly and create a work environment that fosters autonomy, mastery, and a sense of purpose. The book cites several interesting examples of organizations that have created new and highly successful models for motivating their workforces.     Drive is an important book. Plus it's a quick and entertaining read. I highly recommend that any manager or employer who wants to get the very best from his/her employees at all levels ought to study Drive, as well as First Break All the Rules by Marcus Buckingham.

0783225857|5.0|Talk about the legacy of acting legend Gregory Peck.  This compelling actor played two of the most iconic characters in all of cinematic lore--[[ASIN:B00005AUKA Captain Ahab]] and Atticus Finch.  (And Peck played both roles in his own unique, creative style.)  With respect to Atticus Finch, Peck merely enhances an extraordinarily good film, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, based on Harper Lee's phenomenal and timeless [[ASIN:0061120081 novel]].  I've read the book and seen the movie, many times; experiencing both are extremely rewarding.  In particular, the film works marvelously, for several reasons.<br /><br />For openers, Horton Foote penned a riveting screenplay, while director Robert Mulligan brings Lee's novel to vivid life.  The film is blessed with very believable child actors in Mary Badham (Scout) and Phillip Alford (Jem), who both made their silver screen debuts.  The supporting cast is spectacular, including a grisly, disheveled James Anderson playing villain Bob Ewell and a very young Robert Duvall playing reclusive Boo Radley.  Add to that Peck's commanding performance as a widowed lawyer and father of two children in the Jim Crow South during the Great Depression, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a movie for the ages.  Highly recommended for all movie collectors and cinema buffs.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

0385341008|4.0|It's amazing how a book solely composed of letters could get so deeply into characterization and plot.  There is a great story within the pages of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.  The authors did a tremendous job putting you in the hearts and minds of these ever so amusing characters.  For the most part the story here is light-hearted and full of hope and happiness, but that is not to say that there is no sadness, tragedy, and physical and emotional pain mixed in.  The beauty and happiness of the people living on Guernsey Island is borne through brutal hardships brought upon by the Germans during the WWII occupation.<br /><br />The book's flaw:  It took about a hundred pages before I started to enjoy the story.  The first ninety or so pages took me a while to get through, partly because I was getting used to the epistolary writing method and partly because it took some time to even care what the characters were writing about.  By the halfway point (book two) I was fully engrossed and although the ending was predictable, it was satisfying and appropriate. For the well-intentioned characters, living on the island (after the occupation) was like being on a permanent vacation with all their loved ones.<br /><br />Although I give this book high praise, it paled in comparison to The Book Thief.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I've watched this movie twice in the theater, and now once at home.  It hits a home run for me every time!<br /><br />Those first 5 minutes are so funny and touching.  As kids, Carl and Ellie share a passion for their explorer hero, Charles Muntz, and his voyages to the mysterious Paradise Falls in South America.  They marry, with a newlywed goal of actually going there, but life's challenges prevent it from happening.  They have their careers, he as a balloon vendor, and she as an animal trainer, at the local zoo.  Clearly, they love kids, they love people, and they love each other.<br /><br />And then Ellie dies, their fantasy unfulfilled.<br /><br />It's easy to call old, lonely Carl Frederickson a \\"curmudgeon,\\"  and I had this sense from the previews.  However, a curmudgeon is \\"an ill-tempered person full of resentment and stubborn notions.\\"  Okay...maybe he WAS a curmudgeon for a short period!  But most of his life he was not, and he certainly is not a curmudgeon by the end of the story.<br /><br />Carl finds that he is going to be shipped off to Shady Oaks, a relaxing place for seniors to be seen and not heard.  But Carl, with a lifetime of experience handling helium balloons and that fantasy about Paradise Falls, makes other plans.  And the elderly-assisting, snipe-hunting  Russell, a dedicated and enthusiastic (but terribly urban) Wilderness Explorer Scout, finds himself, accidentally, on the same journey.<br /><br />And this is all in the first 10 minutes!<br /><br />Ed Asner is the voice of Carl, and  Jordan Nagai is Russell.  These are well-matched voices with the characters, and the evolution of Carl and Russell throughout this story is touching, comical, and uplifting.  Dug, the speaking dog (it will make sense in the story), is a perfect sidekick - SQUIRREL!<br /><br />So who will like this movie?  If you are not really a fan of animated movies, the unique story may still be worth the investment of time.  It's a movie for all ages, and all cultures.  In fact, you probably have to be dead NOT to enjoy it!<br /><br />Don't let go of your dreams.  Love as if every day is your last.  Look for adventure.  Keep those promises.  And...<br /><br />SQUIRREL!Don't let go of your dreams.  Love as if every day is your last.  Look for adventure.  Keep those promises.  And...    SQUIRREL!

B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Nice to have this series that created all others on Blue Ray. Looks and sounds great. Very pleased to have added it to my library.
B00164EAC8|5.0|If you like good B popcorn movies, Godzilla is one of them.  Just have a seat and follow the story. This Blu Ray Edition has a great HD picture and a terrific HD sound (your neighbors will call the police)
1594488886|1.0|I have not read this book and I am not going to read it. After reading the Kite Runner I have concluded that this writer is incapable of writing anything good. The Kite Runner was the second worst book I have read in last ten years. The worst was Da Vinci Code. At least Da Vinci Code didn't pretend to be 'literature'

B0027BOL4G|5.0|After watching this documentary, I am more aware of what my family eats and where it all comes from. I feel that it enplanes why our obesity rate has multiplied in the past 20 years. with all the growth hormones and the e-coli poisonings. this is a MUST WATCH Show! Thanks to Oprah, i would have kept suspecting what was happening to our food. But now I Know about the tons of antibiotics and the geneticly altered foods that we eat. We as a Nation have a right to know. It's the corporations that have taken our rights away in a underhanded way. As a nation we have always been told that united we stand divided we fall. We have become so trusting in our food. The doctors have been questioning why are So many people so Sick? Why does America have a weight issue, what about illegal immigration? well this explains that too. It also gives you Hope that if we bind together and stand up for ourselves. we CAN change these companies, AND our political system. I recommend that everyone watches this video. It's powerful, It's informative, It's matter of fact. every company that is represented in this documentary has had the opportunity to be interviewed but for some reason they declined. So much to hide and too much money to loose. the CEO's of these companies don't care about the health of the American people, it all come down to Money. What do we care about? Money or our health? Do we really care about the future of our children? they won't have one if we allow the companies to carry on like they have. They take living animals and change them into creatures that are sick and sell them to us, to feed to our kids. What are we going to do about it?
B002ZG997C|5.0|Not only did I pay to see it several times, but I plan to buy the DVD as soon as it is available. It is biblical b ased as Eli (Denzel Washington) does the work that God wants him to in a violent post apocalyptic world that has burned all religious books. One educated person (Gary Oldman) really wants a copy of the Bible because he remembers the power that the word has, so he can use it for his own twisted purposes.     If you haven't seen it, you have to rent it or better yet buy it when it comes out!

You've probably got ONE CLICK enabled...you're in front of your computer right now (probably at work no doubt) and unless you've been in a coma for 40 years you know who Jeff Beck is so do yourself a favor buy Live at Ronnie Scott's RIGHT NOW!  If you do, you will be thrilled and amazed beyond belief and if you don't...well... what's her/his name two cubicles over will NEVER go out with you because you are a musical knucklehead! So impress her /him with your good taste and your ears and eyes with Jeff and his band's astonishing performance.
0316044938|4.0|The Lovely Bones is written from the most interesting point of view I have seen in a book. This story is written from the point of view of Suzie Salmon, a young girl who was raped and murdered by a man in her own neighborhood. She then continues to tell the story from her position in her heaven. While intriguing and well developed, this is not a story that I would recommend to just any reader.     The Lovely Bones is a story of murder, rape, adultery and a family falling apart after the loss of their oldest child. These moral issues make this a book for a mature audience that thinks carefully about what they want to expose themselves to before they pick up this book. The rape and murder scene alone is very explicit and enough to make any adult's blood run cold. In addition to this there are other moments that portray strong sexual ideas, often outside a marriage relationship.      From her heaven Suzie Salmon is able to watch what is going on in the world beneath her and can see her family's life continue after her death. She can see the way her dad obsesses over Mr. Harvey, the suspicious man down the street that killed her, but he can't prove it. She can see the way that Mr. Harvey finds joy in his crime and how he prizes the trinkets he has collected from each of his victims. She can see the way that her mother pulls away from the rest of the family and clings to simpler times. She can watch her little brother and sister grow up and be the kids in school that everyone looks at funny because they're the dead girl's siblings. As Suzie watches all of this she tries to communicate with someone still on earth to tell them that Mr. Harvey is her killer, or that they should move on with their lives. She finds a very unexpected ally in this but no one listens to the weird girl in school, giving Suzie no way to help her family.      This book is a wonderful read as long as the reader is prepared to deal with the moral and psychological issues addressed within its pages. The writing is outstanding and the story will keep you turning the pages all the way to the very end. It is only then that the characters and reader of this story find a sense of peace and are able to let Suzie Salmon enjoy her heaven while they enjoy their lives.
B001PPGAIK|5.0|How can you go wrong with Hugh Jackman?  Australia has the style of the old EPIC type movies...larger than life.  It has something for everyone...Action...Adventure...Romance...Cattle rustling.  And, to see this movie in HD BluRay is awesome.  Now we can watch it anytime we want, at home.
B001R10BM8|2.0|can't play it on my blu-ray player.says i need update which i cannot find on line.
B002ZG4Q5W|4.0|I just received my copy of the Studio Canal Ran from Amazon. The first thing I did was AB this version with the Criterion SD DVD. The Sudio Canal blu ray version is absolutely better, hands down. Could it be better? Absolutely! There are definitely problems, ie the whites burst in the outdoor scenes and the grain is inconsistent. But the images are sharper with  much more detail. Colors brighter. Just a guess, but the film source probably has limitations, so no matter whom was going to release the blu ray it is probably never going to be reference quality. It is the best version of this film released on any home entertainment format.  Until there is something better I will be happy owning the Studio Canal version of this great film.
B001UV4XX8|3.0|This movie is set in 1976 and Cameron Diaz plays Norma Lewis, the wife of a NASA scientist (Arthur) and mother of a 10 or 11 year old boy Walter.  A box in a plain brown wrapper is dropped on their doorstep at 5:45 AM and inside is another box, this one is black with a glass dome, locked, over a red button.  An elegant letter is enclosed telling them to expect Mr. Steward at 5:00 PM.<br /><br />A man arrives (Arlington Steward well played by Frank Langella), the left side of his face horrifically injured but healed.  Much of the tissue of his cheek and some of his neck is missing and you can see his teeth.  This is sort of the best part so pay attention.  He gives Norma the key to the box.  He shows her a briefcase filled with a million dollars, and gives her a hundred dollar bill, to keep.  He says that she has 24 hours to decide to open the box and press the button.  If she presses the button, someone will die, someone she does not know.  However, in return, she will get one million dollars, tax free.  If she does not press the button, she will not get a million dollars, the box will be reprogrammed, and given to someone else, and he leaves.<br /><br />I don't want to give the \\"surprises\\" away, but as you can imagine, the plot is not so simple as that.  What I couldn't figure out is how the writer thought this was in any way suspenseful?  I kept imagining in my mind this guy going to 99% of households and explaining \\"If you press this button, I will give you a million dollars...\\" and the wife or husband immediately pressing the button like on Family Feud.  Then he has to say \\"Wait a moment, I'm not finished, if you press this button, I will give you a million dollars, but someone you do not know will die...\\" and they press the button again.  Then he goes on \\"Stop pressing the button, let me finish, you have 24 hours to decide...\\" and they press the button.  And then they ask questions like \\"I pressed it three times, can I have three million?\\"<br /><br />Still kindof fun to watch, good special effects, a little mystery to unravel.
B002WY65VU|5.0|This is a great product and a great purchase. The seller was honest and effecient.
B002Q9MZF6|5.0|This is really a magnificent film -- a transporting experience.  The music, the acting, the setting and the cinematography all combine to make the story really come alive.  You care deeply about the characters, and understand their passion for each other.  This is by far the best La Boheme I have ever seen or heard.
1439190275|5.0|I got my book yesterday & am THRILLED with everything I have read so far. I found myself jumping all around the chapters trying to soak everything in at once. I am now in the process of reading it from start to finish, page by page.    I love the study info & science info they give. I love the instruction it gives. I love the way it explains modifying the diet to your personal preferences.    This book will be a FANTASTIC tool for keeping me on track. Atkins Nutritional Approach is a life plan and, with only 4 weeks into the program, it has helped me in so many ways. I feel my attitudes changing. I feel renewed sense of self. I feel EMPOWERED! The book may actually just save my life!    Hope you all get your books soon!
B000FBJHZS|5.0|This book is smart and thrilling!  It has all of the intricately complex elements of \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons.\\"  However, this book is NOT based on any religious content.  Tom Clancy has seemingly stopped writing his Jack Ryan thrillers (unfortunately), and Grisham seems to take a two year vacation before starting each new book.  So if you like these authors, you should love this book.  Dan Brown has found a way to make this book just as compelling, but without the infinite detail of Clancy and by writing the book with a real ending (unlike Grisham).
B001NE80P4|5.0|This used DVD was sent in great condition, exactly as described, and was in my mailbox in no time.     I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
B0000071GA|5.0|As a child, my father would lift weights in our basement and I can recall this album playing all the time.  Of course it was a cassette tape at that time.  For the time this album was released, it was right in sync.  Ozzy Osbourne's \\"Bark at the Moon\\" and Iron Maiden's \\"Piece of Mind\\" was released the same year, as well as Judas Priest's \\"Screaming for Vengence\\" the year before, Headhunter fit right in.  With electrifying, fast paced songs such as 'Headhunter', 'Eat the Rich', 'Night Wolf' and 'Ready to Burn' - the album is really able to get your blood pumping.  The high-pitched vocals of Marc Storace brings out evil and angry overtones that accompany the the lyrics quite well.  They did a wonderful metal cover of Randy Bachman's 'Stayed Awake All Night' which is most likely the band's best hit-to-date and can still be herd on classic rock stations.  As well, this album is the only Krokus album to feature Steve Pace on drums.<br /><br />If your not familiar with Krokus, however you enjoy early Ozzy, Priest and Maiden, then \\"Headhunter\\" is almost a must have to your cataloge.  Every song on the album is good. You will not be disapointed.

0783235380|4.0|Ben Holmes, a pretty regular guy, is on his way to his wedding. A little accident hinders the takeoff, and soon Ben finds himself in a third person's rental car together with eccentric but attractive Sarah. Several catastrophic incidents later, the two are thought to be a married couple and run into Ben's best friend and his girlfriend, who happens to be the bride's best friend. Now, Ben and Sarah have to face the problem that they really might be made for each other, but they also might just be panicking about the upcoming events: His marriage and her first meeting with a special person. This movie is very entertaining and not particularly predictable. There's good acting, lots of interesting developments, and a very good story. A nice movie, with enough humour and charm to entertain.
0307454541|5.0|Fresh, easy to read, a true insight into the workings of the human mind...a brillant mix of agatha christie and faulkner...a book that entertains and fosters thought, a feel good experience, elegantly wraped in wry humor.
B00013RC66|5.0|An attractive woman appears to have made her goal in life to marry rich men and collect the inheritance when they die. Nothing new there, except that to speed up the process she kills each of her husbands with a poison that leaves no trace. Hot on her trail is a keen female federal investigator who cannot convince people about the murders or that the same woman keeps inheriting the money. Winger and Russell are sensational here, characteristically different yet essentially the same in nature. The sinister plot trappings and black widow symbolism keep the movie lively. \\"Black Widow\\" is an unforgettable psychological thriller, worth watching again and again.
6305882592|5.0|This is a classic. One of my most favorite movies of all time. I have loved it for over 20 years.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|In Nazi occupied France, young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller takes a rapid interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the \\"Basterds\\", a group of Jewish-American guerilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history. \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. The entertainment and laughter is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. Tarantino delivers, and this movie does not disappoint.
0385737947|4.0|The Maze Runner was an interesting read. It was one of those books that takes me forever to pick up to read more, but when I do I don't want to put it down.   The book was fast-paced, and the plot was very interesting and original.   The Grievers were pretty scary as far as monsters go, but it was kind of hard to picture them in my head, as they're a mix between a living creature and machine.   This is the first book in a series, so the ending is a little abrupt, and not a lot is explained, but I enjoyed it.
B0031OCY2E|4.0|Mark Whitacre has worked for lysine developing company ADM for many years and has even found his way into upper management. But nothing has prepared him for the job he is about to undertake,  being a spy for the FBI. Unwillingly pressured into working as an informant against the illegal price-fixing activities of his company, Whitacre gradually adopts the idea that he's a true secret agent. But as his incessant lies keep piling up, his world begins crashing down around him.  Mark Whitacre is portrayed by Matt Damon another role that he seemed born to play. \\"The Informant\\" performances are mostly good, and the story has some surprising twists and turns.  \\"The Informant\\" succeeds at what it set out to do, get inside the head of Mark Whitacre, an intriguing and satisfying movie.
B000089Q9D|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  It has a soundtrack that Ennio Morricone wrote that captures the atmosphere of a simpler time in Sicily perfectly.  There are so many reasons for the characters to be petty and low with each other, and they just don't.  The reconciliation between mother and son at the end of this movie is rivaled only by Act IV of The Marriage of Figaro.  Watch it with your girlfriend and she will kiss you all night long.  I'm afraid my review makes no difference, and I apologize.  All I can say is that you will laugh a lot at the relationship of a young boy and an old man who stands for the boy to get out of the little town they are in, and to never come back, but all the best reasons.  Do yourself a favor.  Just add this one to your collection.  There is not a whole lot of Italian dialogue to manage if you don't speak it.  The subtitles are superb, and you don't miss a thing.
6305127697|5.0|An arrogant, high-powered attorney takes on the case of a poor altar boy found running away from the scene of the grisly murder of the bishop who has taken him in. The case gets a lot more complex when the accused reveals that there may or may not have been a third person in the room during the murder. The intensity builds when a surprise twist alters everyone's perception of the crime and what really happened. In this strong, twisting court room crime drama thriller, a young Edward Norton shines with this performance that makes the movie a strong, unsettling movie. The dynamic tension between Richard Gere and Laura Linney lends to the underlying swirling dance of political and emotional turmoil that lies beneath the surface of District Attorney and high-profile attorney Gere. This is a solid courtroom crime drama with a nice ripping ending. If you enjoy an engaging and involving thriller with surprises, this is the movie for you.
B000002GYK|5.0|One of the most impressive Rock albums of the 60's & a classic for music collectors.  There was no one like Jim Morrison & the charismatic mystery that surrounded him, but Ray, Robbie & John combined for the perfect backing Band at that time. Morrison's vocals were passionate, sometimes shouting, sometimes whispering but always drawing you into the songs.  Ray Manzarek's piano/keyboard work was a trademark as well as the great guitar & perfect drum/percussion of Densmore & Kreiger. They all \\"broke on through to the other side\\" of rock music.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Leonard is an insurance investigator whose memory has been damaged following a head injury he sustained after intervening on his wife's murder. His quality of life has been severely hampered after this event, and he can now only live a comprehendable life by tattooing notes on himself and taking pictures of things with a Polaroid camera. The movie is told in forward flashes of events that are to come that compensate for his unreliable memory, during which he has liaisons with various complex characters. Leonard badly wants revenge for his wife's murder, but, as numerous characters explain, there may be little point if he won't remember it in order to provide closure for him. The movie veers between these future occurrences and a telephone conversation Leonard is having in his motel room in which he compares his current state to that of a client whose claim he once dealt with. If you're looking for something intense, suspenseful, and different than your usual effects-packed thriller, this is the best movie. It's brilliant story telling. You might get frustrated because you don't know what's going on. That's okay. In fact, that's the whole idea. Sit back and find out just how twisted and complex Leonard's world is. You'll have a hard time forgetting how much you enjoyed it.
B00005214X|5.0|Having been 7 years old in 1970, I didn't know the Beatles had broken up, even though I was also aware of John's and Paul's solo albums, which my brother was wise enough to pick up right as they came out.  Out of the three, I much preferred All Things Must Pass.  I didn't know it then, but George was my favorite Beatle and he always will be. Paul and John were much too extreme in their respective charming showman and curmudgeonly angry-young-man cynic, but George had a nicely measured blend of both, and it is apparent in this album.      Since all albums typically open with a strong lead-in track, \\"I'll Have You Anytime\\" seems to be an odd choice on the surface, but its production stays with you and packs a punch.  It immediately sets the tone for the entire album, and the remastering brings out the underlying atmosphere of the recording that I knew was there before, but it's more apparent now.  It's one of the songs that bears repeated listening.  It really makes you want to reach out to people you love.  It's devastating.  \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Wah-Wah\\" are his versions of \\"Plastic Ono Band - Primal Album\\" material.  Reaching out to God for peace and lambasting his former bandmates for giving him headaches (to say the very least) are just as potent as Lennon's \\"Love\\" and \\"I Found Out\\" as well as, ironically enough, \\"God\\".  John and George are both basically saying they'd had enough of Paul Mc Cartney, that he was making them physically ill and that he made himself out to be much more than he actually was, thereby suffocating the two, and they have to break away from the Beatle thing or else they'll both go insane.      \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" packs a punch in so many ways.  It not only echoed Lennon's feelings about society in general, but it's also George's way of smirking in Paul's face as a parody of the structure of Paul's beloved \\"Hey Jude\\" with its simple acoustic guitar opening leading to the bombastic coda repeating \\"what a pity\\", not to mention the song's 7-plusminute length.  Thankfully, George was wise enough to not do any annoying scat singing at the end.      This album has so much bright about it that it bears a separate review for each side, so that's exactly what I'm doing here.  Individual reviews of sides 2, 3 and 4 will follow on their own, then I'll have as look at the bonus tracks.      It's getting a bit late, so I must be on my way to face another day.
1401322425|5.0|When I first came across Jamie Oliver's program on TV years ago, I was a bit put off by what I considered his overly enthusiastic manner.  I continued to watch, however, and soon became a huge fan.  This guy is one of the treasures of the cooking world.     I have all his books and use them all the time.  This latest has lots of gardening tips, etc. in it that I don't need.  The recipes are great and you can skip the parts about how to grow turnips.  The recipe for baked fish with leeks and bacon alone is worth the price of the book, as is the spicy pork and chilli-pepper goulash and the potato and chorizo omelette with a kinda parsley salad.  I've only tried one of the desserts - the rhubarb and sticky ginger crumble which is homey and delicious.  His desserts are usually a high point for me in any of his books and this looks to be the same    I would recommend that you get all of his books.  Immediately!  Right this second!    As Jacques Pepin would say \\"Appy Coooking\\" with Jamie Oliver.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Wow!!!  I have thoroughly enjoyed this album.  I would recommend it to anyone who fell in love with the sound of your voice from the first you tube debut!!!
1423339851|5.0|The book is very good at capturing the essence of small town America.  There are the simple loving long time residents, corrupt politicians, good and bad cops as well as all kinds of colorful personalities living their lives in a small corner of America.  Reacher wanders into the turbelent lives of a number of lifetime residents and finds himself in a life and death struggle to find meaning and salvation for his lonely wandering lifestyle.  He uses the skills he learned while in the military to survive the excesses of organized crime and come to terms with his relationship with his murdered brother.  The audio reader was wonderful and the story was riveting.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I have loved this movie since I first saw it on television when I was a child. I am glad to have the special edition with the additional content. It enhances the movie as well as the world it is set in.
B00004XONN|3.0|\\"OK Computer\\" was the sound or technology and humanity colliding in Radiohead's world with astonishing results. Three years later, and humanity got the short end of the stick. \\"Kid A\\" threw away any previous alignment with traditional rock music and plunged head first into the world of Aphex Twin and Brian Eno. Since Thom Yorke has a generally dour view of the world as it is, the skittering beats and washes of sound tend to submerge instead of uplift. On the Scale of Ambition, \\"Kid A\\" rates a 10. On the scale of listenability? Not so much.<br /><br />\\"Kid A\\" and the follow-up, \\"Amnesiac,\\" are difficult and alienating listens. The song that starts out sounding close to a potential dance record, \\"national Anthem,\\" ultimately breaks down into a blindfolded New Orleans marching brass band colliding with each other on the thoroughfare. Yorke sings atop this with his voice sounding like it's being forced through a metallic filter. It's one of the oddest songs to ever reach the top of the album charts (where \\"Kid A\\" debuted in 2000).<br /><br />There is at least one traditional rock (verse verse chorus with guitars) song here, \\"Optimistic.\\" But really, Radiohead made \\"Kid A\\" as a bold statement of purpose, that after getting critical raves and big sales, they were not out to just \\"take the money and run,\\" as Yorke bleats on \\"Idioteque.\\" I will certainly give them that much credit. However, I can't say that, ten years later, \\"Kid A\\" has held its appeal like \\"OK Computer\\" or \\"The Bends\\" has.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is an excellent movie!  The contents in this movie are something everyone should be aware of.  Listen, if you are eating processed foods you need to see this.  The foods you are eating are not what they used to be.  Please watch this movie!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I really enjoyed the graphic novel, so i had 2 get the movie & It was a fun, beautiful journey!
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Wow!!!!!!! By saying, \\"This album shreds, rips, and kills anything in its path,\\" just does not do it justice. I don't have the words to explain how awesome it is. It is definitely a 5 star album. This album makes Metallica's Death Magnetic look really, really pathetic, like they have training wheels on their guitars. Nothing against Metallica, but I am so sick and tired of waiting around to see if they are going make another TRULY killer album.  .....I'm not going to hold my breath.    On the other hand, Megadeth's \\"End Game\\" succeeds on the level of metal excellence that Metallica can only wish for. Dave Mustaine and the boys revived my faith in old school metal bands. They prove here that they can still kick (_ _) and destroy anything in their path. This album is good, not because I'm a fan of the band and want it to be, but because its coolness exists without me having to think about it. That's what really makes an album great. It's when you play an album and you don't have to think about whether you like it or not, or convince yourself it's good just because you like the band. There is no \\"trying\\" to like End Game. It's just ripping metal at its finest. Very easy to like, and very enjoyable to listen to. End Game will go down as a classic release from Megadeth. Unfortunately, I can not say the same about Metallica's new album.
0646497855|5.0|Before I got this book, I knew that IELTS was a tough exam because I've done General and it wasn't easy, so I thought Academic will be worse. Even though my friends told me it wasn't so bad, I still wasn't feeling confident.     For General I got Ace the IELTS (same author) and it was good, so I bought Target Band 7 for my Academic this time. After I got this book, many things became clear to me, I knew what to expect, how to prepare and how long to spend on preparation. It really gives you peace of mind.

The only problem we encountered was echoing through the microphone when playing on xbox live. After messing around, he discovered that when he turned the volume control on the front of the transmitter down, the echoing stopped. This volume control is only for the extra pair of headphones that you could plug in, so performance of the wireless headphones was unaffected. I am very glad I make this purchase.
0307266303|5.0|I haven't read much Mark Twain, so that quote was new to me, buried deep in the pages of Born To Run. And boy did it strike a chord. For somebody who hasn't run a mile in about a decade (since I left the Army), this book has been a revelation that struck deep into my psyche. It rings a bell. Without researching for myself the scientists, the science, and the studies cited in this book, deep down inside me I know all of it to be true.    And this coming from an obese, couch-loving, potato chip-munching American. I don't hate running. I loathe it. I don't ever remember myself running for fun after the age of 10. I ran to get away from rabid dogs, I ran to get away from the imaginary monsters my friends and I created to spook each other in the dark. In middle school I ran because I joined a soccer team (and the only reason I joined the soccer team was because the alternative was to wear a silly Boy Scouts uniform.) I ran because the Jesuit school I went to used running as a form of punishment (talk back to a teacher, run 5 laps around the back field).     By the time I was 14, I stopped running. I rollerbladed, I skated, I hiked, but I stopped running. That, combined with my new-found love of cheeseburgers, video games, and books, skyrocketed my weight from a svelte 120bs to 185 by the time I turned 17, when I joined the US Army to be an Infantryman.    Running wasn't fun in the Army. I had difficulty meeting the run portion of the required Army Physical Fitness Test. I could do push-ups and sit-ups for days, but couldn't run to save my life. This was attributed to my overweight physique, but after losing 30lbs during Basic Training I still just barely managed to pass the run, squeaking in with 20 seconds to spare. I didn't know it at that time, but I have exercise-induced asthma, the faster I inhale air, the faster my airways shut down.    My career in the Army Infantry didn't last long. As good as I was with everything else about the job, I couldn't run. In the Infantry that was perceived as a weakness. Tired with all the political games I had to play to stay cozy with the tribe I opted to take an early out under honorable conditions. I vowed never to run again after that.     My weight soon ballooned from 180 (which was my maintenance weight in the Army) to 225 (in a span of 6 months). Alarmed, I joined Golds Gym, took to weighlifting with a passion, but kept my cardio to 30-minutes on the treadmill or eliptical for warm ups. I turned into the Neanderthal mentioned in this book, too much muscle, and I was ingesting everything short of steroids to keep/build my muscle mass.    Then my back, which was plaguing me in the Army, started giving me issues again. So I stopped working out altogether, leading a sedentary lifestyle. Office job, fast food, couches, books, and video games. Three years later, at age 24, I was being plagued by migraine headaches to the point of vomiting. I showed up at the doctor's office with a blood-pressure of 240/160. The medical personnel were astonished that I was even walking and talking. Turns out my kidneys were shutting down, cause: idiopathic (docspeak for \\"who the f knows\\"). After 9 months of dialysis I was granted a reprieve, a kidney transplant. That came with it's own set of issues, heavy doses of Prednisone for one. Again my weight shot up from 200 to 250 in about 6 months. 4 years later, I'm still fighting to maintain my weight at 230.    Which brings me to the present. Over 3 years ago, in an effort to combat the weight-gain effects of steroids, I turned to the Filipino Martial Art of Eskrima for some physical activity. Six months ago I read an article on the web about Vibram Five Fingers, interesting, maybe I can use those as lightweight footwear in Eskrima for added stability without exposing my feet to bacteria-laden gym mats (MRSA-anyone?). Then my back felt better. Cool, unexpected, but nice. Occasionally I'd read about the VFFs online (while spreading the message to friends) and I'd catch glimpses about the book Born To Run. I ignored it for months, until the other day I ended up with an hour to kill at the mall, then I remembered the book. Bought it from the bookstore.    Last night I read the book during commercials in between watching LOST. I kept reading until 3 in the morning. I giggled, I laughed, I shed a tear or two. I am an atheist, but what I experienced last night must be what some folks feel when they discover religion. Between these pages I believe I have found the answers as to why I'm sick. Why I don't expect to live past 40. With a kidney transplant under my belt, fending off heart disease and diabetes at 31 I really don't expect to live a long life.    Now, I don't know if there's a salvation to come with my revelation. I don't know if it's too late to try. I don't know if I can run around the block without passing out. I don't know if I can give up meats that I love so much.    But I damn sure aim to try... yo soy El Javali...

B0000WN0ZK|3.0|Michelangelo Antonioni has proved hit or miss with me.  I've seen a few of his films and have either openly LOVED them or, sadly, openly hated them (I know that hate is a strong word, so maybe I just didn't `get' them).  I am kind of somewhere in the middle when it comes to `Blow Up'.  It is a movie that is rich with meaning, but it has a hard time establishing that `meaning'.<br /><br />I feel that maybe the effort put in was stronger than the result.<br /><br />The film centers around a vain fashion photographer who, while searching to find more meaning in his work, attempts to take some candid photos for a magazine.  The photos are of a couple frolicking in an open field.  When he actually gets the chance to develop the film though, he finds that there is more to these pictures than the sweet innocence of love he initially thought he was capturing.  Instead, he slowly (and methodically) uncovers a gun and what appears to be a corpse.<br /><br />There are moments within `Blow Up' that seem to speak so loudly about the directors point of view and the emotional response we are supposed to carry from this film, but sometimes those moments can find themselves lost in the structure of the film.  For me, the vapid existence of the protagonist, Thomas, is the point of the whole film.  While the poignant scenes such as the zombie-like rock concert, the strangely aggressive three-way or the ambiguous `high' party are all key elements to the films unraveling, they can feel almost too abrasive and too `present'.  There are no subtleties in this film and so it comes across almost a little too blunt, to the point where it's hard to take seriously.<br /><br />I wouldn't be quick to say `style over substance' because there is a lot of substance here, I just feel like the style is so thick it outweighs the substance.<br /><br />Another little quibble I have with this film is that it feels very, very dated.  There are films that, while reflecting an era, are able to transcend all time and feel fresh and poignant even today.  For me, `Blow Up' is so much a 60's film that it lacks any feeling of relevance today.  That isn't to say that it isn't relevant (the overall message presented within Thomas's take on the murder in general is very relevant) but it is presented in a way that feels too `past' to make a real impact today.  I don't know how to really explain what I mean, and I hope that isn't coming across as self indulgent, but it was a real feeling I had while watching the film.  It just feels far too `60's'.<br /><br />This is coming from a guy who considers the 60's to be THE best decade for cinema.<br /><br />As far as performances are concerned, the only real standout is Vanessa Redgrave, who proves to be just as captivating in her early years as she is now.  She's a marvelous actress, and her ambiguous approach to her character's panic stricken conscience is rather refreshing and completely engaging.<br /><br />I wish she had more screen time.<br /><br />In the end I have to say that I appreciate the film, I just don't think it's all there.  I was expecting something totally different, something that really struck me on all levels; but it failed to do so.  I can understand the attraction, for Antonioni is a very visual director (this film is littered with marvelous screenshots) and his contrast between the glossed over fake `real world' and the gritty and almost haunting world presented in the photographs is a stellar and meaningful observation (and, in my humble opinion, that closing `mime' scene was pure genius), but if I'm being honest with myself then I must acknowledge the fact that, while it is all here, it isn't presented in the best way.  It loses a lot of its impact because Antonioni didn't feel the need to pull back the `style' so as to expose the `substance'.today.

1572705175|5.0|I have tried a number of times to get into this author's work because my friends have recommended his work for years. Wit, hilarity, irony are frequent words tossed about in reference to his work. On every prior effort I've failed to \\"get it\\". I finally got it in two formats to break this impasse, if indeed it was breakable. First, I got the audio version of JEEVES & WOOSTER, narrated by Martin Jarvis. Then I watched the Video version with Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. I am happy to report that I finally \\"get\\" the humor and fun which readers of Wodehouse have long enjoyed. If you too have had trouble getting into the wit behind the work, I suggest you do the same.<br /><br />The stories revolve around a well connected English gentleman, Bertie Wooster, who is as idle as can be. There are lords and ladies in his family. He did go to Eton and Oxford and now belongs to all the right clubs. However, the way he behaves, is the way most men of his class behaved in England back in his day, when automobiles were first coming out. You do see Bertie tooling about in his roadster.  Bertie is funny but you are most definitely laughing at Bertie, not with him. He is likable but does not have much but air between his ears.<br /><br />Jeeves is as opposite from Bertie as can be. Jeeves is of the working class, Bertie's valet. He is suave, intelligent, well read, shrewd and manipulative. Also, he is always calm and collected, never losing his cool.  In each and every story, it is Jeeves who rescues Bertie, his friends or his family members after they have gotten themselves (always) into some ferocious mess of their own making. Just with picking out potential marital partners, they are all utter disasters.<br /><br />A big part of my problem with Wodehouse and J&W was simply being American. In this same era in America, a well born, well educated man like Bertie would be considered a sluggard for accomplishing nothing. That he could go to (by comparison) Andover and Yale, after being born into a prominent American family, yet be such an idiot that his valet had to do his thinking for him, would not be the making of an American satire! That Bertie and all his friends regard any form of work as beyond the pale is also about as un American a concept as there could be. This classic of wit and satire could only come from England since it revolves around the concept and conceit of the idle English gentleman in that era.<br /><br />Jarvis is absolutely splendid in all roles.  I like Wodehouse much better on audio than on the printed page.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0061703257|5.0|Paranoia is typically considered a bad thing.  It is, of course, a mental illness.  However, we are all prone to it.  This book, set in 1954, couldn't take place during a more paranoid time in America.  There are frequent references to HUAC, freeing of concentration camps from the Nazis, and other references from the start of the Cold War. The actual action takes place at the perfect place for paranoia though, at a mental hospital for the criminally insane on an island off the coast of Massachusetts. Teddy, a federal marshall, is on this island to ostensibly solve the case of a woman who has disappeared from the island, a dangerous criminal since she killed her three children.  Teddy becomes immediately enmeshed by the extreme paranoia which grips everyone on the island.  It seems as if everyone and everything could be part of a conspiracy.  Everyone is paranoid and Teddy trusts no one.  During the course of his trying to solve his case though, he will deal with a basic truth about paranoia: it displaces those realities which people cannot live inside because they are too painful. The novel is receiving increased notice now because of the release of Martin Scorsese's movie of the same starring Leonardo DiCaprio. The film follows to the letter the course of the novel and even manages to enhance it to Hitchcockian levels.  Both are splendid works and you can't go wrong with either. Lehane's novels seem to make excellent movies as there at least three that I can count originating with him: this one, Mystic River made by Clint Eastwood and Gone, Baby Gone made by Ben Affleck.  All of them involve great tragedies but not the tragedies one is necessarily expecting.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B001992NUQ|5.0|This is a great movie. If you want an action fight movie that gets you pumped, then this is for you. Easily on my top 5 list.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both do an amazing job in this.
B002L6NYBS|5.0|Great movie! Wonderful to view with older children, by this I do mean teenagers. We loved it so much that we bought the soundtrack which is superb. We are hooked on the storyline and intend to purchase the orignal St. Trinian's series along with the book. We are definately waiting on pins and needles for the next installment, St. Trinian's School for Bad Girls: The Legend of Fritton's Gold. Rupert Everett is fantastic in his character portrayals, simply hilarious, and Colin Firth is perfect as his foil. Of course the diversity of the student characters and their chosen ideals were a breath of fresh air with vigor and brains. \\"...Until the end-St. Trinian's...\\".

B002SJIO4A|4.0|One of the most enjoyable things about district nine is the attention to detail.  From the way the aliens look to the shanty town they live in; which was presented in such a realistic way that one's attention was continuously transfixed on the images on the screen.  The heroes of the story are both tragic and heroic at the same time and the real question I left the theater wondering is if this was a prophetic tale of how we might treat our first alien visitors?  There's little doubt in my mind that the way the corporations where presented in this film was dead on accurate.  The acquisition of new and more advanced alien technology would boost any greedy companies' bank account.  This movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered at the end; but that is part of the excitement.  Were left wondering about the fates of the main characters and will the protost return in three years as promised?

B001F7MSG6|4.0|Hellboy 2 has a new story unrelated to the first film.  Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) was also a lot more involved in the art direction and wow, it shows.  The visuals were simply beautiful.  Some might like the plot of Hellboy 1 a little better, but after watching it again, I would say they're about equal to me.  This installment is definitely more fantastic and I like that.     I really liked the movie even from the opening history vignette that is acted out by animated wooden figures.  The whole production oozes style.  It has the humor of the first movie and enough eye candy that it would be worth a watch even if the plot sucked, which it didn't.

In the fact many parts of this book are thought provoking.<br />It is a good book to read to young children but as in most fairytale stories there are many instances of provoked thought and pondering that adults will pick up on.<br /><br />Lovely fairytale.
B001FB55H6|4.0|Who watches the Watchmen?  I did, and you should too.    Leading up to the seeing the film, I watched the motion comic, which is a word-for-word animation of the graphic novel minus some interstitial material.  It had been many years since I read the comic and I really didn't remember anything.  Wow, the story is so great.  It puts most every other comic I've ever read to shame.  I love Watchmen.    The movie is very close to the comic.  Many scenes of the movie are also word-for-word with the graphic novel.  There are a couple of relatively minor changes and one major change in the ending that, as you will see if you visit such forums, is hotly debated.  A lot of fans of the comic hate the change that was made but I don't think it's that big a deal.  The spirit of the ending remains the same - the change is in some ways more of a mechanical one, and in other ways I even think it works better than the way it was in the comic.  You'll have to decide that for yourself if you are a big fan of the comic.    The movie itself is very well done.  The directing is great, as are the special effects.  Most of the actors are good.  The guy who plays Rorschach is particularly excellent in his role and really brought the character to life.  There is one particular detractor here - Malin Akerman plays Silk Spectre II and her acting is rather uneven.  By uneven I mean that she's great when she is quiet and I'm looking at her, and even better when she is naked.  When she starts talking, that's when we run into problems.  Big parts of the plot revolve around her character and she's just not good enough to pull off the emotional scenes required.  She is the sole reason for a 4 star rating instead of 5.    My recommendation is definitely to see Watchmen.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|Was there any other band in the history of rock and roll that evolved as fast as The Beatles?  Within a few short years, the Liverpool lads would go from making simple pop music (VERY good pop music, mind you) to creating the most influential music in history.  Revolver is an important step in that process and contains some of my favorite Beatles' songs, including \\"She Said She Said\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"Taxman\\", and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\".  Not only was the music amazing, but Revolver was a technical masterpiece as well, employing the latest recording techniques of the day.<br /><br />Revolver was the first of the 2009 Beatles' remasters I purchased, replacing my original CD version.  In my opinion, the remaster is far superior to the original CD release.  There's more separation between the instruments, each now having a distinct voice.  It's almost like being in the room with the band while they're playing.  The recordings just feel a little more alive to me now, with subtle details I hadn't noticed on the original CD.  My one complaint with the reissue packaging would be the lack of a plastic tray to insert the CD into.  Sliding the discs in and out of the cardboard sleeve will eventually lead to scratching, so I've taken to storing the discs themselves separate from the artwork to better preserve them.  The album booklets are printed on thick glossy paper for a nice effect, but I don't think the packaging would have been spoiled by the addition of that plastic tray.  I've seen plenty of other albums that are a combination of cardboard and plastic that look just fine.<br /><br />The album is amazing and sounds better on CD than it ever has before.  Highly recommended.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I'll just put it on the table:  The movie was excellent.  The actors were all able to capture the spirit of characters I grew up with.  The film was well paced with plenty of action and beautiful visuals.  They managed to get in each character's catch phrase without it sounding overly corny and it was great to find out the origin of McCoy's \\"Bones\\" nickname.     The plot was engaging.  It did include time travel, which normally is a mistake, but if you get past the general problems with going back in time, they didn't try to do any crazy paradox stuff.  The time travel was actually a very important plot device because it allowed the writers to play around with the history of the characters a bit.  It begins with a series of scenes that illustrate formative events in the lives of Kirk and Spock.  Once the film begins, they weave character development into the overall plot and I think that's what really makes the movie great - we get invested in the Kirk and Spock characters.     I really enjoyed Star Trek and can happily recommend seeing it in HD.
0061922315|5.0|Asha is born to a couple in India, Kavita and Jasu. They want a family, but in poverty stricken India, baby girls are not welcome. Kavita's first born was a girl and was killed because of her gender. Kavita does not want the same fate for her second child, and takes Asha to an orphanage. Somer and Krishnan are American doctors and are unable to have children. Krishnan, who is of Indian heritage, convinces his wife to adopt a child from India. It is baby Asha that they choose.<br /><br />This book is so well-written. The words and the paragraphs are like poetry and I found myself sucked in by it. The characters are fascinating. The three women tell the story from their perspectives over a span of 25 years. From their tales, the reader understands the difficulties of having a family in India versus in America. The challenges of poverty are so different from those of a family of doctors in San Francisco, but both couples have troubles nonetheless. Kavita longs to know what became of her daughter. Somer worries that Asha will be out of reach due to her Indian heritage and her bond with her adoptive father. Asha wants to know why she was given up and learn about her birth country. All three women learn about mothers, families, and India as they search to fill their individual voids and find happiness and peace of mind.<br /><br />Secret Daughter is an engaging page-turner. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone with a love of reading.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I recently finished all 7 seasons of The Shield.  This series has to be in my top 5 TV series of all time.     The show is very character driven.  Each one usually has a typical \\"cop show\\" subplot, but the broad arcs are about the characters.  Make no mistake, this is a very dark show.  I would find my moods affected by watching it often times.  I like how \\"real\\" the characters are.  Even the moral centers of the show do bad things and have human failings.  In my view a large part of the series is a meditation on morality.  Vic Mackey does some horrible things but is also in many ways a good and sometimes even heroic character.  It embraces the shades of gray that real people are made up of.     If you have any attraction to action dramas then watch this show.  After the first episode you will know if you like it or not.  As a testament to how much I liked the series, after I finished it I went online and watched the videos F/X hosted of conversations with the cast and creator.  That's not something I ever do.    It's also very unusual for a series to remain strong over such a long run.  That's especially the case when it is a coherent story and not an episodic show like a comedy.  Five out of five stars.  I would give six if I could.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|If it weren't for the fact that I'd seen Oprah, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  But, I did see Oprah and she covered at least 75% of what was on the movie....and even showed quite a bit of it on her show.  Then again, if I hadn't watched Oprah, I wouldn't have purchased the video.  Notwithstanding, it was very informative and I have asked many of my family and friends to purchase it and view it for themselves (those that didn't already see Oprah, that is).
B0015OKWL2|1.0|Righteous Kill could have been awesome with DeNiro and Pacino.  It wasn't.  The two superstars didn't have a great chemistry, and even worse, didn't have a great writer.  The plot just didn't grip me and I couldn't summon any caring for the characters.  I reserve one star ratings for movies I can't even finish, and this was one of them.
B00003CX8N|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much, the character of Helene Hanff as a natural unpretentious book lover was beautifully portayed by Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins was the epitomy of a reserved English gentleman. Brilliant.   This was a quality movie indeed.
B001C4CI8A|2.0|I had high hopes for this film.  Any movie directed by Ridley Scott gets my attention.  Unfortunately it didn't really leave me feeling satisfied.  The plot just seemed ... incomplete.  It's as if not enough happened.    I think my problem is that the plot didn't give me a sense of importance and the characters didn't develop either.  It failed to pull me in and give me some investment in what happens.  Ultimately I just didn't care all that much.  I give it 2 stars - it's worth a watch if you are bored.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Great fun for all action fans and a vampire movie for those who don't especially like vampire movies!
B001DTPZNY|2.0|I saw Indiana Jones 4.  Here is what you need to do if you want to enjoy the movie:       1. Assume that working with supernatural forces for all these years has made Indy sturdy enough to do things no other 66 year old man could do and not need an ambulance immediately after.     2. Forget you saw any of the other films.    Basically, the special effects were cool and Spielberg's direction was on par.  The actors were there for the show.  It's the script that sucked.  The movie largely rehashed scenes from other Indy movies and the ending ... oh what a travesty.  The other movies in the series tended to have lots of humor but they took the main plot arch seriously and had some small nod to realism.  I can only describe the ending of Indy 4 as \\"goofy.\\"  It really didn't seem to fit.  Maybe it was a case of \\"where do we go after finding the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail?\\"  There was another scene near the beginning that seemed straight out of a Looney Tunes cartoon.    Recently I re-watched Indy 3 in high definition.  It is so superior that I would say it's not even in the same league as Indy 4.  How could the same guy have written both films?  Clearly Lucas has been replaced by some alien hack writer.     Verdict:  Give it a watch if you have some time to kill and are really bored.  This movie is Iron Man's bitch.

B001DHXT1G|4.0|Just to avoid confusion - the crappy 2003 movie about a big green guy was titled \\"Hulk.\\"  This release is called \\"The Incredible Hulk.\\"  And it's waaaaayyyy better than the last one.  There are inevitably comparisons to Iron Man since they are both superhero movies.  No, it's not as good as Iron Man.  But yes, it is a very fun watch.  I'd say that the plot of Iron Man is better than Hulk.  This film is pretty straightforward without much in the way of plot twists and such.  But that's fine.  The important part is HULK SMASHES.     Edward Norton stars as David Banner.  His talents are wasted here to some degree, but he does a good job of making the character believable.  Liv Tyler is Betty Ross.  This was an interesting casting decision because she pretty much looks like a soccer mom plus collagen these days.  It's an interesting casting decision because she fits the character quite well, but the tendency in Hollywood is to choose a \\"hot\\" actress as the leading lady and I'd say Liv Tyler doesn't fit that bill anymore.  Ultimately I thought she was a good choice if a little atypical.    The movie had great action and gave a good sense of what Hulk was always about:  rage, power, and revenge.  The final scenes were pretty open ended, but it didn't feel incomplete.  The story in the movie was finished but it still left a sense of wonder about what is going to happen next.  I give it 4 stars and it will probably be a very re-watchable movie.
0307454541|4.0|The original Swedish title of this book is \\"Men Who Hate Women.\\" If you ask me, it suits this story much better than catchier but less relevant \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" because it is in fact about men doing all kinds of horrid things to women. So here is the first warning to you, if you don't handle violence against women and children well, skip this novel.<br /><br />It's hard to give a short synopsis of the book. \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" starts off as an investigation of a 40-year old disappearance of a teenage heiress, but gradually morphs into a tale of serial murder and corporate trickery spanning several continents and later takes in complicated international financial fraud and the buried evil past of a wealthy Swedish industrial family.<br /><br />I found this book extremely engaging and full of action and came to regret many times that I had an audio version instead of a regular paper book. I also enjoyed immensely the amount details about everything - the publishing business, twisted Swedish family, corporate crime, history and political order of Sweden, etc. I am guessing if you don't care to read about any of this subjects, this book is not for you, because it is packed with this information.<br /><br />My only qualm about this book, a small one, was the characterization. The character of Mikael Blomkvist smelled of a male wish fulfillment fantasy, the one where a man is adored by all women, gets laid all the time and always gets lauded for his stellar bedroom skills. Lisbeth Salander also felt a little shaky and I thought Asberger's decease didn't quite account for her strange personality. I thought her antisocial behavior was inconsistent.<br /><br />This however didn't spoil my reading experience. I am eager to move on to the next book and see what Mikael and Lisbeth are up to next.
B000BT97AO|4.0|This move is very strange, but Neil Gaiman is one of the writers and I found it very unique.  The visual style is fantastic and it shares Gaiman's typical fantasy styling.  The story is a bit on the childish side but I still enjoyed it.  If you are a fan of Gaiman's writing then you are likely to be entertained by the movie.
0810970686|5.0|I give this book 3 stars because it is just like the other 3 books, if you read one no need to read them all. However some parts cracked me up. This book is by Jeff Kinny and this book is probably fiction. The main character is Greg Heffly. I think the authors propose is just entertainment. The mood is mostly funny for me. The theme I found was the author wanted to tell us how to survive middle school. I hope Jeff writes a 5th book that is a little different from the others. ~Farve    Jeff Kinney has made another great book in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series guess which one it is...you guessed it, The Last Straw. In this book Greg is trying to make his family go for there New Years resolution but they are not going for it. Like Greg's mom she was going to stop chewing so loud but she didn't stop, his dad was going on a strict diet but it didn't happen, and his little brother Manny was throwing away his pacifier but it didn't last one minute. When Greg was little his dad said if you get out of bed you may run into Shel SWilverstein he still doesn't get out of bed. I have told you too much already so you have to read this book and find out the ending. ~Ray
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is a show about a motorcycle gang that is based in a small California town.  It centers around Jax, a young biker who is VP of the club and sort of heir to the throne.  The series writer/creator previously worked on The Shield and he brings that same kind of gritty realism and character driven drama to this new work.  This is only season 1 and I don't want to hype it up too much, but it really is an excellent show.  The characters are realistic and deep, the story is compelling, and it's an entertaining watch.    Ron Perlman and Katey Segal also star in the series and are doing great work.  I had my doubts if Katey could step up to a serious role after a life spent doing comedies, but she has won me over.  Ron Perlman does great work as always and is an excellent fit for the aging leader of the biker gang.    I really can't recommend this highly enough.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|LOVE!!!!
B001TODCII|3.0|The movie doesn't have a complicated plot or deep, dynamic characters.  That said, it's quite a good watch for what it is.  It's primarily a revenge thriller and it does that job quite well.  The burning need for retribution is an extremely powerful force in the human psyche and this movie plays on that emotion quite effectively.  It's not a movie that I want to keep, but I really enjoyed it for an evening watch.

B001HUHBAE|3.0|Zodiac was a great movie if you come at it with the right expectation.  It's sort of a dramatized documentary about the investigation of the Zodiac Killer.  The events in the film stick pretty closely to what we know of the case.  Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey do a great job as the lead actors.  If you are at all interested in the case then give the movie a shot.     Just don't go in expecting a scripted action movie - this story ends like it did in reality.
B002RSDW80|3.0|My parents and sister watched this with me.  My father usually fruitflies in and out of the den during movies. His actions during Julie & Julia summed it up: he would get up and do stuff at the other end of the of house during Julie Powell's personal story and come back to see if the story focused on Julia Child's life.  Why couldn't they have done a whole movie about Julia Child?  Was there any legal restrictions?  Why couldn't they have shown more cooking?  More France?  More wherever else Julia and her husband lived? There really weren't many thoughts about why Julia felt so strongly about what she was bringing to US kitchens and how it would affect our culture at the dinner table. It is not just the food but the sense of community around the table.  A director like Ang Lee or Sydney Pollock could have honored the meaning of Julia Child better.  I enjoy a lot of Nora Ephron's work.  I am not crazy about how we have to weather the uninteresting story presented of a young woman learning to cook and blog.  Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci conveyed a lot of that.  The cast and crew in the Julia side of the story took us into that time. All the Julie side of the story presented was some priveleged, mostly happily married, self-indulgent young woman not really grasping history just meeting a goal to prove something.  Well, something to which we can look forward is the eventual really great foodie movie and great biopic that can make up for it.  Meryl Street and Stanley Tucci are worth renting this. Ang Lee's Eat, Drink, Man, Woman or even Tortilla Soup; Babette's Feast; Tampopo; Stanley Tucci and Tony Shaloub in The Big Night; even some of the funnier cooking moments in Hitchcock's Frenzy or some of the cooking tips in the Godfather movies can make up a good foodie festival.

0446613444|2.0|The Black Ice is the one you can leave off of the Harry Bosch \\"must read\\" list.  The book was a chore to read, and at times, I contemplated giving up on it.  It lacks any real plot or character depth. Even Bosch is not as problematic or interesting in this novel.  After a slow, laborious attempt at a dual-homicide plot synthesis, the book rushes through at the end only to fall flat. I love most of Connelly's Bosch and non-Bosch books, but this is the worse of the lot. Instead, read The Black Echo if you crave vintage Bosch.
B000SO7OMA|4.0|Great video. Excellent quality both visually and audibly. Like the fact it came with 2 CD's of the same concert so it makes it easy to burn onto Ipod to take anywhere!

0446567337|3.0|There was so much hype about this movie and knowing that the book is always better I bought this one.  It was very predictable.  I knew what was going to happen before it happened.  It was quick, easy reading but wasn't one of Nicholas Sparks best.
B001OQCV6K|1.0|I wanted to like \\"Sherlock Holmes.\\" I really did. But this movie was so bad that I nearly fell asleep five different times during the film, which is a rarity for me. I'm 35 and have a film degree, so I'm not some senior citizen who can't let go of earlier Holmes versions or the text of the written works (or who can't stay awake past 8:30). I found the writing to be trite, dull and often just plain silly. The actors did the best they could with the muddle of a script and the bad directing from Guy--if the story gets boring, throw in a fight and some property damage--Ritchie (whose films I used to enjoy). And the dialogue was unintelligible at several points in the film. If I can understand Monty Python, I can understand any British accent. It wasn't the accents, it was the mumbling of the actors and the pacing of the story. Maybe Ritchie figured he could make the story more exciting (good luck) by speeding up the dialogue. If you like brainless and badly directed movies, you could do worse than \\"Sherlock Holmes\\"...but, seriously, why would you want to?

1401307787|5.0|Learning to be present is a skill that we can all stand to learn and develop. This is a ask that Jon has taken to heart and describes so well in his books. Being fully present in the moment allows us to experience the full richness of life as well as creating a more compassionate space in which suffering can heal and transform. A great read. If you would like to read more about the theory and practice of mindfulness, I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' by Dr Peter Strong, an in-depth exploration of mindfulness meditation.
0805091742|2.0|Essentially, the book is a collection of anecdotes with distressful outcomes; each alluding to a human error. For each story, the author argues that if a checklist is prepared and that checklist addressed the specific human error, the world would be a better place. Perfunctorily, this appeals to us, maybe because we enjoy dwelling on \\"what-if\\" scenarios: \\"only if the surgeon had ..., a life would have been save\\". The fallacy is that the checklist would be humongous because it will have to address many other potential human errors, and that would take an inordinately long time to go through, for example, by a surgeon before an operation.    In the introduction, a person nearly dies because the anesthesiologist administered a dose of potassium a hundred times higher than intended. This caused asystole. What kind of a simple checklist could have averted this situation? Would it be worth for everyone in the operating room to spend time on this checklist before each operation? There are likely to be hundreds of mistakes an anesthesiologist can make, and there are likely to be hundreds of reasons for asystole.     Simple checklists are used more often than the author surmises, though they are not named as such. For example, in my work, software, our project management timelines are essentially checklists. When I go hiking, the leader provides a list of dos and don'ts, and a list of safety items to bring. These are checklists. When assigned a new project, I note down important steps. If I had to do a similar project again, I use this bullet list so I do not repeat mistakes and perform tasks faster.    update (March 6 2010): The book does not give a single illustrative example of a checklist, although there are lots of anecdotes mentioning that checklists dramatically improved outcomes, or tantalizingly suggesting checklist use. The author could have shown prototype checklists, at least for the stories where checklists have purportedly benefited.    Also, a chunk of the book is about inter-personal communications; that renders the title misleading.

B001NXDIMK|5.0|My husband and I started watching \\"Damages\\" on the recommendation of a friend just before the start of season 3.  We had watched season 1 on DVD and loved it and knew we'd need to see S2 before the new season began.  None of our local stores had it in stock, so we purchased it from Amazon (at a great price) and received it promptly.  We began \\"power watching\\" the episodes one after another, and were so happy that S2 was as good as S1!  William Hurt played an amazing role, and it was great to see Ellen's character developing.  Plus, the appearance of a \\"bad guy\\" from S1 made it fun.  We are officially hooked!

B002RVZV9K|5.0|A very good film likely to evolve into a classic over time. I saw this in a movie cinema assuming my wife and I would be 2 of a handful of people there. The theatre was packed. The film was thoroughly entertaining, filled with both laughter and eye-watering moments. I'd recommend this film to anyone, not just guitar fans. There are too many highlights to list. What was most interesting was the amount of training Jimmy Page received as a youngster. Jack White is quite an intense fellow incapable of the pop riff - its all intense emotion with him. The Edge is the wall of sound I expected he would be - hugely powerful. A great film!
0394721780|5.0|If you've seen the movie, you'll love the book.  It's an \\"oldie but goodie\\",  as they say.  The book is great because it gives you a template for different kinds of foods, e.g., soup.  Even though all soups are different, the book extracts the \\"sameness\\" of the various recipes and gives you the underlying template, so that you can go on and create your own soups.  Or mussels -- there is only one way of steaming them, but the differences are in the sauces, flavorings, etc.  Also book provides hints on pre-cooking steps, best utinsils to use, etc.  Should have made this purchase a long time ago!
B000X1Z0BU|1.0|I wish I had opportunity to view this movie before purchasing - never would've bought it. I rely on user reviews. I was stung this time. I didn't see any story line and the music is not that good. Chalk this up to a lesson learned. I'll be lucky if I can give it away.
B0030BYWKU|3.0|Jason Der&uuml;lo's self-titled debut is one that is full of promise, though comes over at times as bit predictable.  'Predictable' describes a great bit of today's pop music, though every now and then, some left-field smash, much like \\"Um Whatcha Say\\" comes around and breaks the mold.  [[ASIN:B0030BYWKU Jason Derulo]] isn't a bad album, in fact there are enough promising moments to make this 32 minute affair more than enjoyable, however, you'd be hard pressed to find anything that topples \\"Um Whatcha Say\\".  Sure, tracks like \\"In My Head\\" and the range-showing \\"The Sky's The Limit\\" standout, but haven't we already heard tracks like this from Usher and Chris Brown in the past?  That's my main complaint with this debut.  Der&uuml;lo has a great voice (not necessarily more distinctive than anybody else), but solid.<br /><br />\\"Um Whatcha Say\\" is the shining moment, as expected by anyone who purchased this effort.  The production is perfect and it is something different in a saturated urban market.  Not surprising the Imogen Heap sampling track shot to #1.  What more is there to say, it's a rare 5-star track.  \\"Ridin' Solo\\" is certainly catchy, cool urban-pop at its best, but it brings nothing new to the table overall.  Like Jay Sean's good, but \\"tried and true\\" [[ASIN:B002SEW5Y0 All or Nothing]], the track and the album itself feel more like we're retreading already treaded turf.  With that said, \\"Ridin' Solo\\", again, is pretty addictive.<br /><br />Second single \\"In My Head\\" is good, though it suffers the \\"sophomore effect\\" in comparison to monster hit \\"Um Whatcha Say\\".  Despite this, the track has become a top ten staple on the pop charts, which is good for Der&uuml;lo.  Sure, I prefer \\"Um Whatcha Say\\", but \\"In My Head\\" smartly opts for hard drums and catchy songwriting.  Vocally, Der&uuml;lo sounds great.  As far as showing off prodigious vocal range and solid vocal performance, \\"The Sky's The Limit\\" shows one of Der&uuml;lo's best vocal moments of the entire album.  The electronic production recalls Chris Brown's \\"Forever\\" (a song I was never crazy about), but for this track, it works.  \\"What If\\" finally slows things down in an album that seems like an adrenaline rush, showing the softer side of Der&uuml;lo.  It stands out - in the scope of this album at least.  \\"Love Hangover\\" is solid, though nothing revolutionary, again a problem with this album in my mind.  \\"Encore\\" revives a bit of momentum, reminding the urban listener of Usher.  Again, the producers opt for more electronic helmed production, and it grows a bit weary on the listener, particularly on an R&B album.  While the problem of overwrought keyboards and synths isn't a problem on this album as it is on say Ke$ha's [[ASIN:B002XNEII2 Animal]], it still grates on one's nerves slightly. \\"Encore\\" is solid, despite my minor quibbles.<br /><br />\\"Fallen\\" reminds one of a Ne-Yo track, despite not being penned by the R&B singer-songwriter or the Stargate production team.  Not bad, it also isn't truly exceptional - middle of the road.  Closing track \\"Blind\\" ends the brief affair on a solid note, even if it never quite reaches the \\"epicness\\" of say \\"The Sky's The Limit\\" or mega slow jam \\"What If\\".  Good closing track, nonetheless.<br /><br />Essentially,  'Jason Der&uuml;lo' is a solid affair, but ultimately aside from mega hit \\"Um Whatcha Say\\", it doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table.  Sure the production is crisp (sometimes to electronically derived) and of course Der&uuml;lo can sing, but I think that his self-titled debut shows more potential and promise than a truly cohesive set of R&B/pop gems.  3 - 3 1/2 stars in my eyes.ls Chris Brown's \\"Forever\\" (a song I was never crazy about), but for this track, it works.  \\"What If\\" finally slows things down in an album that seems like an adrenaline rush, showing the softer side of Derülo.

B002N1AERI|5.0|Design Your Universe is a a breakthrough release, continuing and expanding on the style and drive heard in their previous release, The Divine Conspiracy.  Simmone has never sounded better, using a broader range of her vocal talents than in earlier albums.  The band has also expanded the instrumentation, including full orchestra and gothic choir on nearly all the tracks, without losing focus or detracting from their metal sound.  The songs are catchier on this release even than on Divine Conspiracy; Burn to a Cinder stands out in this regard.  Jansen's growls also fit, where they've sometimes seemed over the top before.  All in all a solid release... easily their best to date.

B001QERPDO|5.0|I remember when I was watching VH1 and I had seen the video for the awesome and beautifully sentimental song, \\"Breakeven\\". It was so catchy and such a really good song! After I had heard this song for the first time, I was hooked! I wanted to learn more about this band that I have never encountered before until then!  I went to the nearest F. Y. E. and I listened to the entire album and I loved the collection of smart, cool, and entirely melodic songs featured on their self-titled disc. The brilliant album has an opening track, \\"We Cry\\", that is light hip-hop with a nice groove and plenty of solid drumming to get your feet tapping and head nodding along easily...Another song that is great is the hit song, \\"The Man Who Can't Be Moved\\".  We cannot forget the song, \\"Breakeven\\", as well.  One is definitely rewarded with such a refreshingly unique sound from The Script and several people think that these guys are reminiscent of Maroon 5, and honestly, not much.  The Script is more nuanced, colorful and expressive with lyrics that make you ponder and feel things on a deep and personal level.  Just listen to \\"Breakeven\\" and you may understand what I was trying to convey.  After listening to this superb album which is surprisingly devoid of any disappointing songs, one has to add this one to the music collection and enjoy it at any time of the day.
1608201236|5.0|I remember reading my first Adrien and Jake mystery novel in college at a local Borders. Since then, I've read a lot of mystery and m/m novels, but I keep coming back to this particular series.    Dark Tide does an excellent job of giving me exactly what I wanted. The fifth book follows the fourth book's plot closely, and I really felt Adrien's weariness and frustration with himself in this one. Adrien's various exes, including the mysterious Mel, who I had been curious about, all show up. I'm rooting for Adrien and Jake to get together, and the author really doesn't make it easy for them - both have to struggle to get what they want.

B000026LE3|4.0|If you like Pink Floyd, you will like this album. It is, IMO, that this is the album where Dave's guitar work started to take flight. His solos in Atom Heart Mother and Fat Old Sun are very good. And FOS is one of my favorite Floyd songs. If your just getting into the Pink Floyd sound, this isn't the album for you. I am a huge PF fan. I have all their CD's. Its not their best. It's ahead of A Momentary Lapse of Reason, Piper At The Gates of Dawn, and Ummagumma. All the songs on this album were solo pieces by each with exception of AHM and Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast. If, Summer '68, and Fat Old Sun were written by Roger, Rick, and Dave respectively.

B00008A7QK|4.0|Electric Warrior does not quite reach the heights Marc Bolland and T-Rex soon would on [[ASIN:B000FVGN00 The Slider]]- a lusher and more quirky album. But being one foot from the top of Everest is quite a nice position.<br /><br />Electric Warrior may be one of the great cases for rock and roll. Back in 1971, when progressive heavy was wrapping its roots around the bedrock, T-Rex proved that you could take almost 1950s style, and make it sound modern and yes, progressive.<br /><br />Hear \\"Mambo Sun,\\" \\"Jeepster,\\" any track you happen to random on the CD player is self contained and basic rock.<br /><br />Sort of: and that \\"sort of's name in Tony Visconti.<br /><br />Visconti was working with Bowie, and perhaps more relevant here, Gentle Giant--one of the most complex of the Vertigo or any label's progressive bands.<br /><br />But Visconti also gave equally loving care to straight rock and roll, which he was as emotionally invested in as prog. The strings and thick layers on all these tracks make them as juicy and delicious as anything on Vertigo or any art rock.<br /><br />This is a rock and roll album, and thanks to Bolland as well as producer Visconti, an extremely smart one. Basic rock became glam and grand, and as musical and delectable with 1970s production as opposed to that of the 1950s.<br /><br />When you had to be fantastic in the 1970s  just to be thought of as good among rocks most diverse and extensive population, ever, T-Rex and Electric Warrior stuck out like a healthy thumb for kids who wanted to put down the Hammond B-3s, put on that diamond star face paint, and simply rock
B002SJIO5E|4.0|Making some interesting points about how people often interact with minority groups, \\"District 9\\" is more than your standard story about aliens. An alien ship has come to Earth and the aliens have been forced to live in a shantytown in South Africa for 20 years. The movie focuses on how people treat these new neighbors. There are graphic scenes with dead and mutilated bodies (mostly alien) plus weapons which tear people apart, so it isn't for the squeamish. Personally, I cringed a bit at the start but got used to the nauseating parts about halfway through the movie. The story is rather interesting, the acting is decent, and the directing is well done, so it was worth it. The aliens done by Weta, the same company behind \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Avatar\\", are very different and yet realistic.    There are basically two parts to this movie - the documentary-style build-up showing the conditions the aliens are forced to live in, and the pursuit after one of the humans starts to cooperate with the aliens. The human in question, Wikus, is in charge of a team from MNU, a weapons corporation designated to evict the aliens from their shanties so they can be moved to even smaller concentration camp style quarters. At the start Wikus dislikes the prawns (a derogatory term for the aliens) as much as anyone. During the eviction operation, Wikus accidentally gets exposed to a substance which starts to transform him slowly into an alien. Since the alien weaponry can only be unlocked by their DNA, Wikus becomes the one man who can fire them. Headed by his father-in-law, MNU wants the ability to utilize the weaponry at all costs, including Wikus' death.    Wikus manages to escape capture and is aided by one of the aliens and the alien's son. The alien is trying to travel home and the two form a cautious alliance. To accomplish their goals, they are up against the corporation as well as Nigerian gangs who have similar designs on using the alien weaponry. Being in close contact with the alien, Wikus learns more about them and gains a better appreciation for their situation.    One can easily draw parallels between how the humans in the movie treat the aliens and how various minority groups have been treated over time. The humans don't actively try to learn anything about the aliens; therefore, as an unknown, the aliens become something to fear and battle against. They get pushed aside and scorned. When it comes down to it though, the aliens are very much like the humans. They have similar emotions, children whom they care for, and just want to go home.
B00000342V|5.0|There are times as an avid listener of massive amounts of music when we, without being aware we are, dismiss what is well known. We have had Sgt. Pepper or the White Album or another universally known record that we have listened to almost since infancy. We either forget it in our quest for learning the unknown--or, we throw it on as background when we are at a loss of what we thirst for.<br /><br />It is not that we ever stop loving this music. But like an old lover, we forget why we love in the first place.<br /><br />Then one day, we step back from the flame, and.........WOW! That tingle through the bones we forgot is back. We are older, more tired, but that moment comes, as do tears to the eyes.<br /><br />Today, I took that unwitting step with an old valentine, Curtis Mayfield's Superfly. Yep: the wonderful tears and the wonderful tingle came. If you are reading,  no explanation is needed. But then I remembered why Superfly, and Curtis, occupy that top top top top level where the air is different and the music is the most important music. Viscerally and intellectually, we remember.<br /><br />Superfly of course works on both levels: back in the early 1970s when funk and sweet soul were two very different mediums, Curtis Mayfield did not combine but made synergy. Listen to \\"Freddie's Dead\\" or \\"Pusherman\\" and hear how Master Mayfield mixes the toughest beats with the softest strings--how the music both soothes and attacks. DJ's now don't sample sweet soul for beats, but \\"Freddie's Dead\\" being one of the world's best orchestrated AND most sampled songs is no mistake.<br /><br />Only Curtis could do this, and if the music didn't bring the tears and tingles and dances the musical constructions would not much. But the emotions come and the music means everything.<br /><br />And it means everything because Mayfield made it so how Mayfield exclusively could. Superfly came in 1972: about when the Civil Rights movement was ending and the African American Community, in some parts, started turning against itself. With drugs and crime and helped by white apathy.<br /><br />Mayfield had his finger not on the pulse but the vain of the black struggle back with the Impressions in the early 60s, before he could even write about it.

0380725398|4.0|Having fallen in love with Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier, I was anxious to read something else by her.  I was not disappointed with Jamaica Inn.<br /><br />It's the 1800's and Mary Yellan is a twenty three year old woman who has lived her life on a farm in Helston. She helped her mother with the family farm after her father passed away. When her mother loses her will to live, she shares with Mary her final wish. She says that Mary is to go to live with her Aunt Patience in Bodmin after she dies. Patience' husband Joss Merlyn is the Innkeeper of Jamaica Inn.<br /><br />Mary arrives at the gloomy inn, and is shocked by the woman her Aunt Patience has become. Formerly outgoing and cheerful,  now she is nervous, quiet, aloof and frightened. Her husband, Joss is creepy, mean and secretive, and Mary realizes early on that this is not a place for her or her aunt, as danger lurks within the crumbling inn.<br /><br />(p. 159....\\"She thought of Aunt Patience, trailing like a ghost in the shadow of her master, and she shuddered. That would be Mary Yellen too, but for the Grace of God and her own strength and will.\\"<br /><br />Mary wants to escape but she is torn because of the promise she made to her mother. She feels her aunt is not safe with Joss, an alcoholic, and she wants Aunt Patience to escape as well. Strange things are going on at the inn on the Cornish coast.  I don't want to give spoilers, but there are never any guests and is not even open to the public, and secretive things happen late at night at Jamaica Inn.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS  - If you like Gothic novels, and stories that evoke the atmosphere of horror and dread, then this novel should be perfect for you.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED - 4.5/5 stars

0810970686|4.0|My thoughts:  Positives:    * Really quick read  * Cartoons are always comical.  * Shows Greg is really starting to grow up and get new interests.  * Is perfect for everyone, especially for a little light reading.    Negatives:    * This was not as funny as the last two  * There is no real change in any of the other characters, so the same jokes have been told before.  * There are a lot of things that happen within this novel that mean absolutely nothing.  * He is extremely self-absorbed and therefore we have a limited view of everything that happens around him, I think that the more this series continues the less connection most boys will have with him.

B002E01MHY|2.0|well,this is a strange film.the way it sounded and looked had a TV  movie feel to it.you know,cheesy,generic 80's music and low production  values.yet,it definitely is not a TV movie.it's the first(and likely  last)film i have seen from Italian director Lucio Fulci,who also wrote  the film.it's not that i hated the movie.it has it's merits.for one  thing,the killer has an interesting(though never explained or put into  context)quirk.and there were several viable suspects.until the very  end,i wasn't sure of the killer's identity.any time i'm left guessing  to the end,that's a positive.i also thought the acting was pretty good  from the principals.what i could have down without are the long  lingering shots of women being mutilated.that just doesn't do anything  for me.ultimately this is what sinks the movie in my mind into the  'would not watch again' category. none of the positive aspects can  overcome this.for me,Lo squartatore di New York AKA The New York Ripper  is a 2/5

B00009W0WM|3.0|i enjoyed Casablanca,but i wouldn't say it changed my life.it's a  pleasant movie,with a good story,good acting,a good locale and an  interesting cast of characters.there are some memorable lines,to be  sure,but some of them some seem a bit corny.there were one or two eye  rolling sentimental lines delivered by Humprey Bogart to Ingred  Bergman.but i realize that's probably due to the fact that the movie  was made almost 60 years ago.regardless,it's well worth watching,in my  opinion.there's no special effects.so it's really all about the  characters,the story,and the acting.if those elements aren't  successful,then the movie won't work.in this case,they are.for  me,Casablanca is a 3.5/5
0307454541|3.0|As the start of a \\"thriller trilogy,\\" The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo does an excellent job of introducing and developing characters, telling one rather interesting tale of a twisted, dysfunctional family with a host of dirty secrets, and lassoing readers into the world of Swedish intrigue. Before I read this novel (which, in the original Swedish, is actually entitled Men Who Hate Women--a much more accurate title), I knew the basic elements of the main story, and Larsson does a great job of building suspense as he tells the story of the Vanger family and its dark history. The resolution of that story is something of a disappointment--it's plausible and well-plotted, but in terms of dramatic payoff, it's decidedly anticlimactic. The weakest part of the novel, however, is the framed story that's wrapped around the Gothic tale of the Vangers--Larsson's inner story competes with his framing story of journalistic integrity and corruption in the world of international finance. BIG YAWN. The two stories are connected tangentially, but the framed structure of the novel saps almost all of the inner story's intensity, and the book ends on a rather flat note. I am, however, eager to read the sequel, as well as the third book in the trilogy.
B002HREKCI|4.0|Thirteen Reasons is the story of Hannah Baker and as the book title suggests, 13 reasons why she died. All these reasons are in fact related to 13 people who helped her reach the state she did-the state where she felt like she had no other choice but to take her own life. Before she commits suicide, all the people who were somehow responsible for it were sent a set of tapes so that the person knows how much his/ her actions affected Hannah.<br /><br />Whenever I hear somebody committed suicide, my first thought is obviously \\"Why?\\", followed by thoughts like how can something this trivial force someone to take his/ her own life and leave so many unanswered questions and blame games behind. But it's almost never one thing; it's never \\"just\\" or \\"trivial\\". It's a culmination of many incidents and as Hannah says \\"A snowball effect\\". Thirteen Reasons Why shows exactly that, the other side of suicide, something which we would probably never get to see or should see.<br /><br />Hannah Baker is the new girl in town and like everyone else she finds it difficult to fit in. Hannah has left her own town and with that her old life which was filled with rumors and she hopes to start with a fresh slate. But things don't turn out how she wants them to. Rumors follow her in the new town as well, trusts are broken, games are played and at one point Hannah doesn't feel safe anymore, neither in her school nor at home.<br /><br />Clay Jensen is one of the guys who gets the set of tapes. The book is an intermingled narrative between Hannah's voice in the tape and Clay's thought process or rather his reactions to it. It helps the reader get a different perspective on Hannah's story. It also made it difficult for me to get into the story. The moment I felt I was getting involved in what Hannah was saying Clay would come up with totally unrelated things to say, not always unrelated, but many times. I know Clay's perspective was important too, but it wasn't done as well as it could have.<br /><br />The writing was okay. In fact I really didn't think I was going to like this book at all. Some where after the first 100 pages, the book really picks up pace. But I feel the power of the book lies in the story, in the message. To some people it will help realize how even their smallest of actions could affect someone's psyche if it was fragile enough. Teenagers usually tend to be insensitive and wrapped up in their own world, it would hopefully make them realize that everyone's worlds are overlapped and some things could have greater consequences than they realized. But on the other hand, it does not provide any hope to people who are probably thinking of giving up on the world like Hannah.<br /><br />I would say it's a good book which would probably be great for teenagers and adults as well.fact I really didn't think I was going to like this book at all.

0691142165|5.0|Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff render a great service to their readers by clearly demonstrating how the excessive debts that governments, banks, corporations, or consumers accumulate during a boom often end badly because of the precariousness and fickleness of confidence (p. ixl).  The \\"this-time-is-different syndrome\\" is based on the fragility of highly leveraged economies, in particular their vulnerability to crises of confidence (pp. xxxiv; 15-20; 287; 290-292).<br /><br />To their credit, Ms. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff convincingly make their case by making extensive use of a comprehensive database that is worldwide in scope and covers the last eight centuries of financial crises (p. xxvii).  Both authors focus most of their attention on the two types of crises that are the most relevant today, i.e., sovereign debt crises (e.g., Greece) and banking crises (e.g., United States) (p. xxvi).  Countries and banks can be vulnerable to a loss of creditor confidence, especially when they depend on short-term finance through loans or deposits (pp. 28; 105-106).  In contrast, Ms. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff do not spend much time on defaults on household debt and corporate defaults beyond sovereign events (p. 251).<br /><br />The book under review offers key takeaways for readers:<br /><br />1. Inflation, exchange rates, and domestic and sovereign default crises often hit concomitantly with banking crises, especially in the most severe ones (pp. 73-77; 145; 173).  External default crises or high inflation crises are often correlated with large domestic debts (pp. 125; 128).  Inflation crises most often occur in coincidence with exchange rate crises, especially in countries subject to chronic inflation (p. 189).<br /><br />2. A country's own history of default and high inflation are the key factors that determine external debt intolerance (pp. 25; 32).  The willingness to pay rather ability to pay is typically the main determinant of a country's decision to default on sovereign lending (p. 54).  In contrast, outright defaults on domestic public debt are extremely rare, even if governments may inflate debt away (p. 110).  Once a country slips into being a serial defaulter, it retains a high and persistent level of debt intolerance (pp. 29-30; 94).  The same factors are also likely to weigh heavily on domestic debt intolerance (pp. 33; 67; 169).  Without the pull of an outside political anchor (e.g., the European Union for the PIIGS), recovery may take decades or even centuries (pp. 30; 150).<br /><br />3. Today's advanced economies once experienced the same kind of default, inflation, and debasement episodes that plague many emerging economies today (pp. 44; 179; 283-287).  A government's ability to establish political institutions that sustain large amounts of debt repayment constitutes an enormous strategic advantage by allowing a country to marshal vast resources, especially in wartime (pp. 55; 58; 65).  In contrast, no major country has been able to graduate from banking and currency crises (pp. 147; 151-153; 272; 284).<br /><br />4. Many governments and multilateral institutions show a remarkable lack of transparency in failing to make time series on domestic debt easily available.  Surprisingly, global investors do not ask for a raise in risk premiums on new debt issuances in the absence of easily available time series on domestic debt (pp. 137-138).<br /><br />5. Markedly rising asset prices, slowing real economic activity, large current account deficits, sustained debt build-up (whether public, private, or both), and capital flow bonanzas have been particularly strong indicators for financial crises, at least in the post-1970 period of greater financial liberalization (pp. 214-217).  The U.S. showed virtually all signs of a country on the verge of a (severe) financial crisis in the run-up to the 2007 subprime financial crisis (p. 223).  U.S. policy makers should have decided several years prior to the current crisis to deliberately take some steam out of the system (pp. 199-200; 221).<br /><br />6. Inadequate regulation and lack of supervision at the time of liberalization may play a key role in explaining why deregulation and banking crises are so closely related (pp. 155-156; 217).<br /><br />7. On average, during the modern era, real government debt increases by 86 percentage points during the three years following a banking crisis in both emerging and advanced economies (pp. 142; 170; 238).  This empirical evidence results mainly from the significant adverse impact that most banking crises have on government revenues and the existence of substantial fiscal stimulus packages in some episodes (pp. 164; 220; 231).<br /><br />8. To place the U.S. housing bubble in perspective, the cumulative real price increase was about 92 percent between 1996 and 2006, more than three times the 27 percent cumulative increase from 1890 to 1996 (p. 207).  Real estate collapses are protracted affairs.  Declines in real housing prices average 35 percent stretched out over six years (pp. 224; 226).  Today, U.S. home prices are already a third below their 2006 peak.  V-shaped recoveries in equity prices are far more common than V-shaped recoveries in real housing prices or employment (p. 239).<br /><br />9. Pre-election posturing and post-election uncertainty are often key drivers of sovereign defaults and financial crises.  Unsurprisingly, the U.S. subprime crisis became much worse in the run-up to the country's 2008 presidential election (p. 53).<br /><br />10. The global nature of the current crisis has made it more difficult, and contentious, for individual countries to grow their way out through higher exports or to smooth the consumption effects through foreign borrowing (pp. 233; 239; 269)<br /><br />In conclusion, Ms. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff make a compelling case that many policy makers around the world should learn more from history to try to soften the blow of impending financial crises instead of pleading too often their ignorance and/or powerlessness when these crises hit them (pp. 277-282; 287-290).  The pervasive view that \\"this time is different\\" is precisely why this time usually is not different and why financial crises eventually strike again (pp. 80; 98; 270).).     6. Inadequate regulation and lack of supervision at the time of liberalization may play a key role in explaining why deregulation and banking crises are so closely related (pp. 155-156; 217).    7. On average, during the modern era, real government debt increases by 86 percentage points during the three years following a banking crisis in both emerging and advanced economies (pp. 142; 170; 238).

V-shaped recoveries in equity prices are far more common than V-shaped recoveries in real housing prices or employment (p. 239).    9. Pre-election posturing and post-election uncertainty are often key drivers of sovereign defaults and financial crises.   Unsurprisingly, the U.S. subprime crisis became much worse in the run-up to the country's 2008 presidential election (p. 53).    10. The global nature of the current crisis has made it more difficult, and contentious, for individual countries to grow their way out through higher exports or to smooth the consumption effects through foreign borrowing (pp. 233; 239; 269)    In conclusion, Ms. Reinhart and Mr. Rogoff make a compelling case that many policy makers around the world should learn more from history to try to soften the blow of impending financial crises instead of pleading too often their ignorance and/or powerlessness when these crises hit them (pp. 277-282; 287-290).  The pervasive view that \\"this time is different\\" is precisely why this time usually is not different and why financial crises eventually strike again (pp. 80; 98; 270).

B001NXBRJG|3.0|I must say I'd expect more video quality for this movie's BD. Audio is excellent, but the image quality doesn't match many other less expressive titles.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is such a fun movie.  The acting is superb.  The music is so beautiful.  I love the scenes with Emma and Mr. Knightley.  The chemistry works so well.  \\"Emma\\" is not my favorite Jane Austen story.  It's rather silly and light, but this movie fleshes out so many of the characters and gives you more time getting to know them.  There are times when the movie doesn't feel very old-fashioned, but overall, it more than makes up for this.  The second half is even better than the first.  So, give it some time.

0470450266|5.0|I new before I purchased this book that Scott Spencer  knows his stuff he has the rare combination of talent and the tutelage, his new book exceeded my expectations. Its really more then a book but a training kit. The book is well written and has high quality images along side the instruction. The DVD really went beyond my expectations each chapter of the book which cover different aspects of sculpting the human male has a complementary high quality video with Scott at the helm going over the entire process. The DVD also supplies all of the files needed to get started and use for reference throughout the process. This book does expect the end user to be familiar with ZBrush but he does go over the more high end aspects of the software like normal mapping, re-meshing, and UV mapping. Although sculpting is the main focus there is also a chapter on digital painting again Scott combines traditional techniques in concert with the digital medium. Ultimately this book/training kit ushers in a new age where artists can learn the human form sinew by sinew muscle by muscle completely within ZBrush.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|I loved this book and couldn't wait to watch the movie version.  Overall, I'm glad a bought it, but feel that they could have put a little more spark in the romance, a little more tension.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|Great CD.  I hardly ever buy CDs anymore, but this once is great a fabulous addition to my collection!
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I've enjoyed this movie many times since first hearing the Riffs' exclamation as an advertisement for a midnight showing of The Warriors in the early 1980s. Walter Hill's Ultimate Director's Cut is even better than the original with the comic book segues and the intro with Greek history analogy. It's appropriate since The Warriors has a classical feel; it's a perilous journey homeward to Coney Island. The Warriors  contains marvelous performances throughout, for me especially Michael Beck and Deborah Van Valkenburgh. Anyone remember her as the good girl daughter on Too Close for Comfort in the 1980s? The creativity in crafting gang appearances, especially the baseball furies, always cracks me up, and the Rogues' ranting \\"Warriors come out to pay-eay\\" is unnerving genius.<br /><br />This is a masterpiece on many levels. Forget the criticism of the silly gangs. The cult aspect of the film's popularity would be lost without it. It could have been grittier, less comic-bookish, but that would have produced a different movie entirely, closer to Death Wish. I think this could be the quintessential American boy-girl story, also. Swan and Mercy have never been anywhere, as they state, but together they'll overcome any obstacle.
0805091742|4.0|Others note that the gist of the book is in a 2007 New Yorker article.

0547258305|5.0|this book was a great fantasy read. i enjoyed it and i can be picky.  just don't watch the video on the book's page or you won't want to read the book.  the video makes the book look stupid and overly dramatic when its actually a fantastic story.  the video is just dumb.  don't judge a book by its cover or in this case, by the video trying to advertise it but failing miserably.
B0027YUK98|4.0|Why term the packaging \\"Eurotrash\\"?  Because it is extravagant novelty for its own sake with no concern for how frustrating it is for the consumer.  You cannot read the booklet without laying a clumsy assembly down on a desk, and there is the very real chance that repeated use will result in tearing some CDs housings off the others.  I know this isn't clear, but if you buy this otherwise wonderful set you will understand.    That said, this set is terrific.  Crystal-clear sound, elegant and imaginative phrasing; it's all here.  I see what one reviewer said about a measure of aggression from Ms. Faust, but it seems a valid enough approach to me.  I compared this with the Szeryng on Philips, who does have an extra measure of gentle elegance, but the pianist on this new set comes across with much better recorded sound.    I haven't seen the DVD yet, but the sonatas could very logically have been put on 3 CDs only, leaving the DVD by itself without the Kreutzer on it's opposite side.  More bad post production applied to an excellent recording.    You won't be disappointed musically, but somebody at Harmonia Mundi is very, very bored.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|The biggest complaint I found before buying this DVD was that they had not kept true to the book.  so what!!!  the series is based on the universe created in the books, and even though there was a lot created for t.v. it is still the best fantasy show out there.  I got this on Monday and have ended the last show today, just have watched it throughout as cant stop until the end.  this should be on mainstream UK telly, but as usual the good shows from the US take years to get to us, this would be an instant hit.
B002ZHKZD8|5.0|The \\"Ultimatum\\" was icing on the cake for me! To finally learn the circumstances of poor Jason's involvement in the \\"Black Ops\\" was really fulfiling. I found myself rooting for him throughout the film. That old saying, \\"if you are not with us, you are against us?\\" Well, that applied throughout. He wanted nothing more to do with them, but for some reason, everything that could go wrong went wrong and was consequently blamed on him again and again. He cleared himself of any involvement again, but is this the last time he will be targeted as the \\"source\\" of their (the CIA'S) problems? I hope not! I hope they continue this series until either Matt Damon is a senior citizen or they figure out a way to kill the character!<br /><br />Matt Damon is the best. I was aware of him, but never took the time to really watch him perform in his previous films.  The \\"Bourne\\" series caught my attention on the TV presentation of the \\"Identity\\" film which frustrated me with the commercials so I rented the \\"Identity\\" and this began my curosity into the entire series.<br /><br />I'm happy to say I own all three now and watching them without the commercial interruptions has allowed me a chance to really appreciate this actor's skills.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|SUMMARY:  When it WORKS, it is the best surround sound wireless headphones on the market today!  But inconsistent loud popping and crackling, which is dependent on too many unknown factors, may be a deal breaker for many of you.  Do some research, and if you buy this, buy it with a extended warranty, or at least a company with a good return policy.  For my detailed review, read below:    [[ASIN:B002KSPKRS Ear Force X41 Digital RF Wireless Game Audio+ Chat with Dolby 7.1 Surround Sound]]    [[ASIN:B000V7N54A Ear Force X4 Dolby Digital Wireless (Headphones)]]    **Disclaimer:  My apologies if this review is a 50-50 compare and contrast between the X41 and the X4.  I'll do my best as to explain my reasons for the low X41 score.  Also, I'm just a regular guy who loves video games just like you.  I'm no BB salesperson or super-sound stereo buff, just a simple person who LOVES the full experience of playing video games.  Anyhoo, I hope you find this helpful:    Let's get straight to the PROS (when it is working) of the X41:    + The Surround Sound processing is by leaps and bounds, INCREDIBLE.  Right now Modern Warfare 2 is my addiction, and its like having a 4th \\"perk\\", and I call it \\"super-sonic hearing\\" perk.  The surround is so accurate I can pinpoint EXACTLY where a bad guy is running from, outside of buildings, far down the street, even from behind me! *Hint, combine this with Ninja Pro and you're the stealth master!!  This is the X41's BEST quality.    + No more A/C adapter (compared to the X4).  Plugs right in any USB powered source.  Nice that it doesn't add to the clutter.    + This is marginal, but I can say that the headset is slightly lighter than the X4's but overall pretty light for it's size.  The ear pads however....(read the CONS)    + Volume output is really crisp and clear and bass enhancement is GREAT when you turn it on.  Again, combined with the Surround Sound positives mentioned above, you will have some incredible gaming experiences than rather using home speakers.  (Again, when it works, read on...)    **So when it works, IT WORKS!!! My goodness, it is probably one of the best wireless headphones (even better than the X4) that I've experienced in my gaming lifetime (30+ years!) but for $199 bucks...hmmm...well read on...      SO THEN IT ALL COMES CRASHING DOWN ---->  The CONS (I'll start with the simple stuff):    - Gosh the ear pads are itchy!! I hate the texture! Especially coming from my X4's, which had a velvet cloth feel on the pads (oooh yeah, lovely).  These feel like you're wearing your backpack/schoolbag strap on your ears.  What were they thinking!?  Seriously, its like a fish net wrapped around cotton on the pads.  AND they're stiff to boot!  Not soft at all!    - The microphone cord for the controller/communicator is flimsy and causes problems.  The X4's had a \\"puck\\" device that held it place on the controller and worked beautifully.  This one however flops around too much and too easily and causes the connector to wiggle around causing REALLY BAD crackle and pop over the communicator.  And good luck if you have an OLD Xbox controller or well-used one, because most likely the hole the plug goes into is probably worn and makes the problems WORSE!    - No HDMI.  Why is this a negative?  Well if you have an XBOX running an HDMI ONLY, you'll be in for a surprise; the X41 (and X4) uses Optical ONLY, meaning yes you have to buy (if you don't have one) the \\"High-Def\\" Xbox cable to exclusively run the optical out of that specific port.  It's only a pain for those who just have been using a dedicated HDMI cable ONLY and probably, like me, donated or sold the \\"outdated high-def\\" cable that I formally used.  Right now I'm running BOTH; HDMI for my high-def TV, and optical for the wireless headphones. Clutter galore...    -  And now the caveat emptor (buyer beware) of this headphone -> SNAP...CRACKLE...POP!  And this is when the communicator IS NOT plugged in.   If you've read this far, you've probably a smart shopper that reads MULTIPLE reviews, and you've seen that this issue is inconsistent, some have it, some don't.  MY experience is also inconsistent, some days I play I'm pop-free.  Other days it's non-stop or just wants to pop at random moments.  But when it DOES happen, it will be utterly ear-popping, teeth crunching, anger inducing, annoying!!  Right now I'm testing X41 headphone #5!  That's right, FIVE.  Good thing return policies are nice here.  Maybe it's my home, maybe I'm a static magnet, maybe a ghost wants to mess with me, maybe not, but I've done EVERYTHING to try and solve the issue when it happens: Changed to fresh batteries, re-syncing, moving the base, moving my router, moving my sitting position (!?), etc... and it still CONTINUES.  Then...it just stops...out of the blue...it just stops...and then it'll start up again....    CONCLUSION:  I've said everything I'd like to say about this thing.  I WANT to love it, I truly do!  It is sheer brilliance when it works, but when I'm knee deep desperately trying to win a closely scored clan-match, I can't have it POP and CRACKLE in my ear when I'm knee deep in machine gun fire, or when my teammates are calling out vital orders.  If you're a hardcore multiplayer/online gamer, you might want to consider something more consistent, or at least consider a extended warranty.  If you're a casual gamer/person looking for an awesome wireless surround sound solution to enhance your gaming experience, not wake up the sleeping baby, etc... this one you should SERIOUSLY consider.  The $199 retail value at most places is a HUGE investment considering.  But all other folks who are interested, make sure you buy it from a store with a good return policy...just in case.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|\\"John Adams\\" is simply one of the best historical miniseries that I have ever seen.  It will help people learn much more about John Adams contributions to the American Revolution and our independence.  It also does an excellent job of showing the debate over independence and the quarrels and rivalries of that time period.  I have used episode 2 in my U.S. history classroom to show my students the debate of independence and how those favoring independence ultimately won the day.  I wish that a similar miniseries would be produced over George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, and perhaps over the American Revolution in general. (I have always felt that the Revolution has not received the attention from Hollywood that it truly deserves, especially compared to the number of movies and miniseries that have been made about the Civil War.)
1859849296|1.0|As an atheist reader, I was expecting Hitchens to expose Mother Teresa as some sort of phony based on what I heard about this book. Instead, he merely speculates about her alleged intentions and smears her with basically no supporting evidence whatsoever. I expected more from Hitchens, who holds himself out as a provider of truth. This book was completely pointless - it told me nothing about Mother Theresa other than that Christopher Hitchens has a baseless hunch that she wasn't as great a person as many people believe her to be.
B0001I55SS|2.0|I ordered this dvd thinking it would be fun to watch \\"Black Hole\\" again after all these years.  Quite frankly, I was wrong.  Disney was obviously trying to capitalize on the science fiction boom of the later 70s (characterized by \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Star Trek\\", \\"Battlestar Galactica\\", \\"Buck Rogers\\", etc.) and did a very poor job of it.  The story is just not that good, and neither is the acting or the special effects.  The plot seemed to be a combination of \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Battlestar Galactica,\\" and \\"Star Trek:  The Motion Picture\\".  There is one main diabolical enemy (like Darth Vader), his troops are all robots (like Battlestar), and they are also facing one great destructive force that is described as potentially having the power to destroy the universe (like the Death Star in Star Wars or the V'Ger probe in Star Trek.)  The robots (especially Maximillian and Vincent) were obvious attempts to capitalize on the merchandising success of \\"Star Wars\\" by coming up with characters that could be turned into toys easily.  I ended up shutting it off about half way through because I decided that it was not worth any more of my time.

B002WCLG3O|4.0|I bought this shortly after its release and watched it first like normal and then turned on the commentary the second time around and watched the extras included on the bluray explaining stuff about the halo universe that even i had little or no clue about even tho i have played all the games pretty thorough. I enjoyed all the shorts honestly except for Origins 1 which had a motion comic type feel to it and i just didn't like the art style but that's personal opinion. The Duels art style would seem good on paper but it just sorta hurt my eyes at times but it also had a very nice effect at times as well but ultimately it didn't pan out for me. I liked them all overall but it could of been so much better and some of the stories wont make sense unless you have knowledge of the universe outside of the games. Overall its worth picking up if your a fan of Halo but if your not already this isn't going to change your mind.
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|A wonderful thing to have when simming. Inexpensive but gives a thrill to the simming experience..with the feel of actually controlling the airplane. and combined with another unit and configured to control all individual engines separately gives realism an added dimension. And combined with ability to configure the levers for different functions makes it possible to 'fly' different aircraft from the big jets to the props. The included throttle heads make up for the 'realism'. Easy and fun to configure and use. The toggle switches, though, feel a little fragile and almost as if they were about to fall off...could be more sturdily built and fixed.

B0035J6TAI|2.0|I like Peter Gabriel.  His score for \\"Last Temptation of Christ\\" is the best thing about the film, and among my favorite CDs.  He is a talented percussionist and a good musician.  But the fact that he is not in any meaningful sense a singer means this CD can best be enjoyed by only two types of people:    Those who have software that enables them to remove the awful vocals and enjoy the really quite nice orchestral arrangements underlying them; and big fans of the musical efforts of William Shatner and Rex Harrison.    The interpretations that Gabriel gives most of these songs is very nearly comical.  Such excess of earnestness turns the serious-but-springy-sounding Paul Simon song \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\" into a parody.  When serious lyrics were wed to a bouncy beat, the song benefited from the fascinating juxtaposition.  In Gabriel's mouth it's just a ridiculous dirge.  Ditto three or four other songs on \\"Itch,\\" notably David Bowie's \\"Heroes,\\" which, once again...hilarious.    Perhaps \\"Itch\\" will gain some cult following as a novelty item for its camp, but this is a CD that all serious music-lovers should give a pass.
0385341008|5.0|This is truly an amazing book!  Everytime I was reading it I couldn't wait for the next time I'd sit down and get to read another letter (the story is told in letters).

B002T9H2LK|4.0|Polarizing filmmaker Quentin Tarantino's unadulterated love of cinema is really the most pervasive factor in his fantastical 2009 World War II adventure. Running an epic-length 153 minutes, it may appear on the surface like [[ASIN:B000EHSVRS The Longest Day]], but the director/writer takes inspiration from Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns ([[ASIN:B001U6YI92 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]), Robert Aldrich's [[ASIN:B0007TKNM4 The Dirty Dozen]], Hollywood wartime propaganda B-movies, and his own adrenaline-infused and blackly comic films ([[ASIN:B000068DBC Pulp Fiction]], [[ASIN:B00068ULLY Kill Bill]]) to tell an audacious \\"what-if...?\\" story about a group of guerrilla U.S. soldiers in Nazi-occupied France. The tightly wound plot revolves around three key figures: Colonel Hans Landa, an elegant, seemingly bloodless Nazi officer known as \\"The Jew Hunter\\"; Lt. Aldo Raine, a Tennessee-born resistance fighter who has organized a special squad of Jewish-American soldiers whose goal is scalping and killing Nazis; and Emmanuelle Mimieux (n&eacute;e Shosanna Dreyfus), a pensive young Jewish woman who runs a movie theater in Paris.<br /><br />As presented by Tarantino over the course of five discrete chapters, the three disparate figures converge upon Mimieux's theater for the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film called \\"A Nation's Pride\\". There in attendance is to be not only Third Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels but also the Fuehrer himself. Needless to say, the filmmaker has carefully set up all his chess pieces for a flamboyant finale that represents a manifestation of some kind of crude moral justice that revisionist history allows only grand storytellers like Tarantino. Riddled with quirky incongruities, some of which border a bit too closely to self-parody, his signature style is evident through a series of set pieces, most heavy on insinuating dialogue, that suddenly explode like the tavern mêl&eacute;e in La Louisiane.<br /><br />In a turnabout from his Oscar-baiting performance last year as the passive Benjamin Button, Brad Pitt brings cocksure arrogance to Raine in an enjoyably hammy turn. M&eacute;lanie Laurent perfectly captures Shosanna's simmering resentment until her cathartic release during the explosive conclusion, while Diane Kruger cuts a somewhat more predictable figure as a Dietrich-like femme fatale actress in cahoots with Raine's battalion. Tarantino fills smaller roles with oddball choices like Mike Myers as a pip-pip British general, Rod Taylor ([[ASIN:0783240236 The Birds]]) as Churchill, and [[ASIN:B000EHRVP6 Hostel]] director Eli Roth as a baseball bat-wielding Nazi killer. Regardless, the best work comes from Christoph Waltz's nuanced turn as the sadistic Landa. It's a masterfully subtle performance amid a movie that is anything but subtle.<br /><br />Waltz's best scene comes right at the beginning with his unbearably tense conversation with a stoic French farmer suspected of hiding a family of Jews. There is also glorious camerawork from veteran cinematographer Robert Richardson ([[ASIN:B0000CDL93 JFK]]). The extras seem a bit too stretched out for the 2009 two-disc set, especially with no Tarantino commentary being offered in this package. Instead, on the first disc, we get two extended scenes and one alternate, the movie-within-the-movie \\"A Nation's Pride\\", and a few trailers. The second disc offers a half-hour round table discussion among Tarantino, Pitt, and film critic Elvis Mitchell; a faux-making-of featurette for \\"A Nation's Pride\\"; a discussion of the original Italian movie, [[ASIN:B00140PKEQ Inglorious Bastards]] (upon which this movie bears little similarity); and a few other more obscure extras.

0767903862|5.0|There is one thing about Bill Bryson; you either like him or you don't.  Just reading the reviews here on Amazon and several other sites prove that.  It is not just this work in question though; it is all of his work.  I note that drifting from site to site that he, Bryson, has a small cadre of \\"haters,\\" and all of their reviews sound sort of the same.  And this is book after book....same reviewers, different books.  You would think that after a few reads, and that if you found you did not like a particular author, then you would simply ignore his work. Not so with this author...go figure. This small group seems to hound his every work.  Anyway, I personally like his books. I grant you I like some better than others, but that is only natural to my way of thinking.  This work being reviewed here is one of his books that I particularly enjoyed.<br /><br />To begin with we need to look at what this book is not.  First, it is not an anthropological study of the Aborigine tribes of Australia.  Yes, he does address them and their historical and tragic plight, but this is hardly the purpose of the book and no, he does not interview any of them.  Secondly, this is not an all encompassing travel guide to all of the thousands of places to visit in this wonderful country.  That would be an impossible task in a volume of this size.  Thirdly, this is not a rough and tumble survivor type of trip (or series of trips, as the case is here) made by an intrepid survival type guy roughing it in the Outback...hey folks, this is Bryson.  A cold beer, swimming pool and a good meal are relished by this guy.<br /><br />What this work is, is a rather amusing and at times downright funny account of the author's trip, or to be precise, \\"trips\\" through various parts of the largest island country in the world.  His travels, tribulations, adventures and encounters with various individuals are told in his normal understated and humorous style.  I think one of the strong points of Bryson's writing is the ability to make fun of himself and to recognize his own short comings as a traveler, and indeed, a human being.<br /><br />Unlike his work `A Walk in the Woods,' the author has kept his caustic remarks about the people he encounters to a minimum and only dealt out his understated sarcasms when they were richly deserved.

0385504225|3.0|The Lost Symbol started out well, but kind of out stayed it's welcome.  The god mumbo-jumbo towards the end was a bit hard to take.  And the apologetics for Freemasonry was just bizarre. Ultimately, what is this book about except the triumph of censorship?    I loved Angels & Demons, thought DVC was ok, but this is a rung below those two.

B001GCUO5M|3.0|Let's be honest...how could this film not be any good?  Best living director in Hollywood? Check. One of the best and most reliable actors working today? Check. Ovah tha tahp Bahstan accents? Fahkin Check. That being said, I was a bit worried when Paramount Pictures decided to move Shutter Island from its Oscar-ready time release in November all the way to movie wasteland in February with Dear John and When in Rome (sorry ladies). That type of change usually only means one thing--the movie isn't any good. With Shutter Island, however, we have an exception. Sort of...<br />  Based on the novel by Dennis Lehanne, Shutter Island takes place in 1954 at a mental facility for the criminally insane along the coast of New England. Detectives Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) have been sent to investigate the seemingly inexplicable disappearance of one of the hospital's female patients. From the second they arrive on the island, it is clear that there is something eerie and mysterious going on. Everyone from the prison guards to the doctors seem to be hiding something. As they dig deeper into their investigation, they realize that there is much more to this place than what meets the eye.<br />  Scorsese holds nothing back with this film. He is one of the most talented and innovative directors out there and he uses all the tools he has here to create over 2 hours of relentless tension. DiCaprio also turns in another brilliant performance as a troubled US Marshall trying to focus on his job while still being haunted by the memories of his missions in WWII at the Nazi concentration camps and the recent death of his wife. Beyond this ambitious directing and stellar lead performance of DiCaprio, however, the movie as a whole isn't anything to write home about. The story itself isn't anything we haven't seen before. Scorsese does his best to gloss up the material as much as possible and he does manage to elevate this film from an otherwise average script.<br />  As you watch the movie unfold and start to put the pieces together, many people will be able to see ending coming before the final twist is revealed.  This doesn't necessarily make it a bad film, but at the end of the day, this is nothing more than a minor entry in Scorses's incredibly impressive filmography. Shutter Island is basically what happens when you give B-list material to an A-list director. If nothing else, the visceral experience that the movie offers is well worth the price of admission. Just don't expect another Departed or Goodfellas with this movie.<br /><br />-Jeffrey Ryan<br />([...])om an otherwise average script.

1416575464|5.0|I got Domino Mag for awhile and thought I'd get this book. It is just as impressive as the mag. Great book for anyone starting to do their own space or a interior designer reference. Incorporates \\"Use What You HAve Decorating,\\" Yard & Estate sale finds, Decorating on the Cheap. All the pictures in this book are very creative and you see combinations that you'd otherwise disregard. Very chic and creative pictures and ideas. I'd give the book 10 stars but 5 is all I can do!!
B002W1UEW4|5.0|I really loved this movie when I saw it at the theater. I am surprised the rating is as low as it is.
B001OQCV2O|1.0|I liked Day-after-tomorrow a lot and expected this one to at least be as good as that one. I really wanted to like this movie and bought it for my collection, in spite of the negative reviews.     In spite of breathtaking CGI, the movie falls short in story and is an insult to the audience.
0805091742|5.0|As a primary care physician, I rarely use checklists in my clinical practice.  I've always considered checklists to be the realm of pilots (used to be in the Air Force, so I would see pilots all the time with their flight plans and checklists). After reading this book, I'm currently thinking about checklists for the 8 or 9 diseases I see nearly on a daily basis.  The book is very interesting, and I will reach back and read his two other books now.
0385532458|5.0|I laughed and I cried and I was so sorry to reach the last page .... it should have been longer!
B000Y7U98C|5.0|I agree with most of the other reviews that this is a great sci-fi flick with a disappointing ending.  I didn't hate the ending, just thought they could have come up with something better.  But that doesn't stop this from being a very good film.  Good acting, good story, great special effects.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|My husband is a true \\"Trekkie\\".  I gave him the series for our 37th anniversary.  Of course he had to immediately watch his favorite episode.  He was a little tearful.  To watch the episodes in Blue Ray was incredible.
B003102JDM|2.0|Seriously, the worst ending to a movie I've ever seen. EVER! Watch it yourself, you'll see. The movie was both terrific and disappointing on many levels, but on account of the ending it gets 2 stars. I hated the ending so much, I almost gave it one star. And I'm a Coen brothers fan. At least I was, but maybe no more because Burn After Reading also smelled - really bad.
B000ICLRJ8|4.0|On Blu Ray,which is what I bought,this movie stands out. It's a good buy for $10.00 and I would not pass it up.<br />Watch this movie on a Samsung Toc and Sony Ps3. All I can say is wow.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|My Wife and I went to the movies to see this. Our child was a fan since he was 9 and I grew up with rock & roll, so I have listened to his music but not really a fan. But my wife wanted to go to the movie so, I was really impressed.  So when the DVD came out I had to have it. Its great.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Nothing comes close to the quality and accuracy of this series. Accurate historical information and characters you feel for. The real life paratroopers who comment prior to each episode enhance every aspect of the series. The extra features disk alone is worth the purchase price. I highly recommend purchasing this in blu-ray to get the full experience and sound.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This book had eye-opening and jaw-dropping information about the food industry.  I knew about the hormones for a long time, but there was in-depth information which really caught me by surprise.  We need to be aware about what we are putting into our bodies each day and our families as well.  Then take action for the sake of our families' health. This video is a must see.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary is a must watch if you care anything about your health, weight, the environment, and animals. As a educator, I strongly recommend that schools share this film with students. There is so much vital information in this film. I'm glad I bought it and will share it with friends and family.
0634022296|4.0|Like other reviewers have mentioned, this book doesn't stay open very well ... you will either have to put weight on it to keep it open or, in my case, bending the binding so far back as to nearly make the book fall apart.    I recently picked the guitar back up after 8-10 years absence, and this was the first book I purchased shortly thereafter. This book is great for those who like to play the Beatles' music. My wife is surprised at how many Beatles songs she actually knows. (\\"I didn't know they sang that one, too!\\").    I would recommend even given the poor size / binding. Would it have been better spiral-bound? Of course, but this book has the chords to your Beatle favorites, and if you're like me, maybe you'll find a few songs that you didn't think you liked as much, but are a joy to strum out the chords.
1906694176|5.0|If you read the first 2 books--this is so much more.  It is full of twists and turns.  It was like watching a thriller. Larsson's characters are so believable in their personality traits, but still left you with wanting to know more about them.  You want to understand why of what occurred to each one and how they were going to deal with the next situation.  The comments at each of chapter helped to understand Lizbeth's plight.<br /><br />It makes you want to read all 3 again, it case yoy missed a character's nuance.
B002GHHHL0|5.0|Have been looking for this DVD for my son for awhile.  Glad I found it on Amazon.  Great action-packed movie for anyone who likes movies about sharks, as my son does.
0756405890|5.0|I started this book not even knowing that the next installment was not yet completed, and now that I'm finished, I find myself itching for the next step in the story.  Rothfuss shows incredible promise for what stands to be an absolutely wonderful trilogy here.  This book is a lot about laying the groundwork -- enticingly hinting at some greatness behind his main character, Kvothe.  And Kvothe is one of the most intriguing characters I've been introduced to in a while, too.  An immense talent with a touch (or more) of arrogance and a well hidden (so far) darkness just to keep it interesting.  None of these archetypes that make a character's actions predictable in so many other books.    This is absolutely one of the best first books I've read since George R.R. Martin, and I can't wait to get my hands on book 2.  Can't recommend this enough!
B000F1IQNM|4.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who has children.  It is a cute movie about a family brought together through the help of a nanny.  It has an all star cast including Dame Angela Lansbury who takes a pie in the face for her role.  I cannot wait to see the sequel when it comes out.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|I bought it cuz I love old disney movies and it was going back into the disney vaults for 5 to 10 yrs.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Wow, what diversity and wonderous sounds.  Except for a couple of songs in which the producers did not bring out a more powerful ending style, this performer's voice rings crystal-clear and ever so special.  This CD is truly worth the listen and the enjoyment will fill your spirit--mine soars each time I play it.  Susan is a Diva from the onset and will ever grow her performances and naturally gifted voice for all's enjoyment.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|We went to Nashville last year & saw Lady Antebellum for the first time & have been a fan ever since.  I love the new album & expecially the title song Nee You Now.
B002N1AERI|5.0|So this is a long time in coming. But here it goes. This is Epicas 4th ablum and it's also the one where they take the most risks. The Phantom Agony was just plain Symphonic metal in the relam of After Forever and old Nightwish. Consign to Oblivion was Symphonic Metal with a bit of rock in there and could be seen as being in the relam of Nightwishs Century Child and Within Temptation and many other female fronted metal bands that came out around that time. In 2007 The Divine Conspiracy mixed the best of there past to albums. There were also parts that were crying out to just be heard better. Such as there first guitar solo and the Prog and Death Metal feel. And for fans of Prog and Death Metal enter 2009 Design Your Universe. If you are fan of Lacuna Coil, Evanescence, New Nightwish, Within Temptation, Sirenia, Tristania, or even Leaves Eyes this may very well turn you off. If you are a fan of Symphonic metal with heavy mixes of Prog, Death and even hints of Black metal then this is just the album for you. For Epica it was a big risk. Jeroen Simons left the band in 2006 and Epica picked up Ariën van Weesenbeek. Then they lost Ad Sluijter and picked up Isaac Delahaye. So what does that do for Epica. Well Isaac and Arien are both from the Melodic Death Metal God Dethroned. What they add is what many female fronted rock and metal bands seem to lack at points balls to the walls metal. Not only is the drumming faster and much more heavy the guitar is a lot more melodic and right up front. You also get six guitar solos. Here's how it all breaks down.    Samadhi ~ Prelude: Not there best opening. But it is what it is. Really think of it as more of a lead into the next song. 2/5    Resign to Surrender ~ A New Age Dawns - part IV: This is where it picks up and starts out really great. You also start to hear just how different this album will be from past Epica albums. The choir is at there best and the guitar playing is tops. The solo mid way into the song will really get you to bang you're head. 5/5    Unleashed: For Epica and for any female fronted metal band this is a very heavy sinlge to have. Though at the same time kind of light. It really gives you any idea of just what the album is like and unlike Never Enough is a very well liked single. 5/5  Martyr of the Free Word: Ok so is this the heaviest Epica has ever gotten? Close but no. I would say it's there 4th heaveist song. The songs starts off sounding like it could come froms Slayer or Dark Tranquillity. Then comes Simone after her part it hits right into the Melodic Death Metal side of music with Mark sounding more wicked then he ever has with his growls. You also get Gregorian chants and a really cool solo. This is not for the faint of heart. 5/5    Our Destiny: This song can be over looked many times. But it is a very good song. Not much to say about it. 4/5    Kingdom of Heaven ~ A New Age Dawns - part V: So this most be the heaviest Epica has ever gotten. Well it's getting there I would place this at 3rd. I really enjoy this song from Epica. Also what's different is that it's Ariën van Weesenbeek not Mark that growls on this. If you are fan of Opteh or most Prog Metal music then you may very well like this. If you are fan of Lacuna Coil and Evanescence though this song well be hard for you to get into. But give it a chance. Has great guitar work. Drumming at it's best Simone and the Choir really doing a great job and just any all around very well down song. 5/5    The Price of Freedom ~ Interlude: I can do with out this song. 0/5    Burn to a Cinder: Kind of different for Epica. It has more of a Power Metal feel to it. Simone also really shows what she can do with her voice. She sound very sexy here and it's kind of a different style for her. 5/5    Tides of Time: Prehaps the best balled I have ever heard in metal music. Also near the end Simone has almost any R&B style of singing going on. The guitar solo in here is prehaps the most powerful I have heard. It's in all out really well down song. 5/5     Deconstruct: Like Our Destiny this song is easy to pass over and forget. Because it's placed between two really great songs. But if you give it a chance it is really good. It starts off sounding like it would come from some epic movie and for the most part stays that way. 5/5    Semblance of Liberty: Do you like Melodic Death Metal? If not this stay away from this song. Simone and the choir are in this song. But it's mostly Mark and Ariën here and if you are not into the heavy riffs and pulse pounding drums this will be really hard to get into. If you like Melodic Death Metal like I do you will really enjoy this song. This is the 2nd heaviest songs Epica has ever made so what is the first keep reading. 5/5    White Waters: I really enjoy this song it's simple and soft and I found that Tony Kakko did a much better job then Roy Khan did. Then again Trois Vierges is not that great of a song. 5/5    Design Your Universe ~ A New Age Dawns - part VI: Prehaps the most symphonic song on the CD and very well done. It starts off slow and just buildds and builds it ends with Simones sounding just as good as she always does. :) 5/5    Incentive (Bonustrack): This is the song that shows Epica at there heaviest. It's also all Mark and the guys hear. You will not hear Simone at all. It's pure Melodic Death Metal. If you ever wanted to know what Epica would sound like with out Simone this is the song for you. All other fans who are not into Dark Tranquillity sound songs well be turned off 5/5 >:}     All and all this a great CD. there are a few things I would change such as The Price of Freedom and a better place for both Our Destiny and Deconstruct. But for the most part it's one CD I have a hard time putting down.
B000E5N684|4.0|This is an amazing movie with one of the greatest story lines.  It pulls you into the story.  Sharon Stone has an iconic moment while being interrogated.  Michael Douglas plays the deceived detective whose life is turned upside down by Stone's character.  I love this movie.
0307716988|4.0|A very good biography, well-structured and interesting. It provides the reader with a lot of information from his childhood to the mid of '80s.

B0032KNA4I|5.0|You have to give credit to director Ronald Emmerich. He can certainly put on a big show, the biggest in town. His movies, such as \\"Independence Day\\" (1996), \\"The Day after Tomorrow\\" (2004) and \\"10,000 BC\\" (2008) are colossal and majestic. And very entertaining. \\"2012\\" follows this dramatic and impressive trend. It is truly a non-stop action, rollercoaster of a film, which will make your jaw drop.    According to the story, by the year 2012 all the planets in our solar system will be aligned with the sun - an event that only occurs every 640,000 years -, and this will cause the destabilization of the earth's core. This, in turn, will make the continents shift, and the world, as we know it, will rearrange itself. This will cause catastrophic earthquakes and tsunamis that will wipe out most of civilization. This apocalyptic event is discovered early in the film, when Dr, Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) visits one of his colleagues in India, who provides him with scientific evidence about our planet's imminent demise. Dr. Helmsley informs his superior, Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt), a high official at the White House, who in turn informs the president (Danny Glover). They take control of the situation and work with other nations on a contingency plan. Unbeknown to Dr. Helmsley, this plan is devised to only saved a few privileged    Enter Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a writer that also works as a limousine driver, who is currently divorced from his wife Kate (Amanda Peet). Kate is currently married to Gordon (Thomas Mc Carthy), and lives together with the children -- Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily) -- that she had with Jackson. Jackson happens to be spending a vacation at Yellowstone National Park with Noah and Lily. While at the park, they encounter some problems that had to do with the incoming disaster. Jackson also meets Charlie Frost, a radio personality that researched information about the cataclysmic events that were about to hit our planet. AlthoughJackson initially dismisses Charlie, he eventually learns, the hard way, that Charlie was right. Together with his children, and Kate and Gordon, Jackson will try to survive by any means necessary.    As with any other Emmerich movie, \\"2012\\" is loaded with awesome special effects, which will leave you asking, \\"How did they do that?\\" Also, as with any other Emmerich film, you will find many inconsistencies and holes. At any rate, whether the story is true or not is irrelevant -- Hollywood is known for twisting reality. And, given the recent earthquakes in Haiti and Chile, everything is possible. \\"2012\\" is spectacular entertainment and you can see where the money is going. The film also stars the very beautiful Thandie Newton. The Blu-ray edition includes picture-in-picture by the director, alternate ending, commentary, and movie IQ(tm). (USA /Canada, 2009, color, 158 min plus additional materials). Reviewed on March 2, 2010. Sony Pictures    Exclusively reviewed for Sony Pictures by senior writer Eric Gonzalez for [...]
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I've been a fan of Shinedown since 2002.  They're music just keeps getting better and better!  I've seen them in concert a couple of times and they are just as good as they are on CD!  I can actually say that I love every song on this C.D.  If I had to pick a couple of favorite songs, they would be \\"Sound of Madness\\", \\"What a Shame\\", and \\"If You Only Knew\\".

B00164CM46|4.0|I like the way Ritchie Directed this movie, the production is a lot better than Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, but I like the story and how it all fit in LSTSB more than Snatch. I give this movie 4 stars because the accents aren't as heavy as LSTSB and it gave me a good laugh. If you enjoyed Rock N' Rolla, definately add Snatch to your Collection, I did.
B002Q4U9YU|3.0|Classic Michael Jackson's hits (not all of them though)+ plus two extra demo versions and a poem. I thought it would be the soundtrack of the movie/ concernt, but it is not the case!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|An eye opening video that has affected what i eat and where I buy it from. I have definitely gotten aware of where farmers markets are and where they products come from. I avoid large grocery chains as much as possible, and I count my vote as important. Even if it is only 3 times a day.     A great film. A must film for everyone.

0553584537|5.0|Mass. State Tpr. Bobby Dodge, a sniper on the Special Tactics and Ops. Team is alerted about a hostage situation. He arrives and sets up surveillance just in time to see a man aiming a gun at his wife. With only seconds to decide, Bobby shots the man, Jimmy Gagnon, killing him.<br /><br />We learn that Gagnon's wife Catherine had been abducted as a teenager and burried underground for almost a month while her abductor abused her. She was saved when hunters heard her cries for help.<br /><br />Jimmy was an abusive husband and Catherine wasn't able to get help because Jimmy's father is a powerful judge who would use his power to stop Catherine's attempts to discredit his son.<br /><br />With his son dead, and his grandson, Nathan, having a history of being in the hospital with sicknesses, the Judge files papers to gain custody. The judge claims that it wasn't his son who was the problem, it was Catherine. Further, Judge Gannon claims that Bobby knew Catherine and killed the judge's son because he, Bobby, had imporper feelings about Catherine.<br /><br />The author sets the stage for what we will read next. It is as if she is a demolition expert because the story explodes with suspense in the final segments.<br /><br />Bobby is a well described character. We learn of his past and this enables us to see why he is so determined to help this woman in distress.  Catherine is such a sad character that we can't help but wonder how all of these bad things happen to her. However, again, the author provides the answers in a well polished, dramatic story.
0142001104|5.0|I first experienced Benjamin Zander on the youtube from a presentation at the TED conference.    [...]  I was inspired by this presentation and when I saw he had a book I was intrigued.  After reading the sample pages I bought it and I continue to go back frequently and re-read parts of it.  Every chapter spoke to my heart.  Many moved me to tears because to the sensitivity with which Ben and Rosamund approach the world.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|FOOD, INC. is very EYE OPENING! Meat just doesn't taste the same now. My husband refused to watch it (because he loves steak) but I put it on while he was in the room... he couldn't quit watching either. After reading Mad Cowboy and now watching this, the menu in our house has definitely changed.
B002WY65W4|3.0|If you're a fan of the horror/zombie genre then you will naturally be interested in Zombieland. Especially if you enjoyed the dark comedy of \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\". Zombieland was clearly inspired by the aforementioned film, and cast wise how could this fail? Well, therein lies the issue. You can't just throw a good cast at a good concept with an average script and expect a genre leading film. It doesn't work that way. Lazy scripts equal mediocre viewing experiences. And in this case we have what could have been a great classic zombie comedy, and in the end we are left with a very average one. Woody Harrelson is perfectly cast. As is a cameo from Bill Murray, again, solid casting. However Bill Murray in his cameo role seemed like he wanted to put as much effort into Zombieland as a guest appearance on a talk show. What a shame, predictable fluffy script writing from fluffy screenwriters sunk this one. If you're a diehard fan of the genre, and don't mind a complete rip of Shaun, then this is an easy buy. Otherwise enter with caution.
B002UZXJA6|3.0|if you're like me and love the celtic music, this album is good. not great because they a lot of American songs with a celtic flare, but i'm American and already know those songs...
B001OQCV2O|4.0|.....  'cause if you do, you'll ruin it for yourself.  The disaster sequence are by far some of the best ever filmed.  We've come a long way with CG.  As for the script and the characters, they were just here to give you a breather between scenes of total chaos and destruction.  Corny lines, unrealistic and unbelievable escapes, etc. just make it so Hollywood.  Kevin Spacey makes it ok but he could have been given better lines.  Bottom line,  lots of action, never boring, heavy on the corn and just all around fun.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Everyone should see this DVD, it honestly tells us what they do to the animals and food we eat and serve to our famlies.

As consumers if we stand up then organic farming would come more abundant and affordable. As consumers, we all could afford to buy healthy and good food and we all deserve accounability in what is being sold to us. All for our health and we desrve it! We would spend less money on doctors and hospitals.  Stand up America!
0670021652|2.0|A very big disappointment after Eat, Pray, Love. What makes Elizabeth Gilbert the guru on marriage anyhow? I finished this book only because I spent the money to buy it but my advice would be to wait to get it from the library. Don't purchase unless you feel like being bored by Gilbert's hemming and hawing about marriage. Either marry him or don't! Don't write a 300 page book about it though!
B001F0TM5I|5.0|I did a lot of research before I purchased this blu-ray, after all Tarantino added tons of after effects to give this movie a very worn out look. But when the movie turns from black and white to color during the second act the HD pops and comes to life.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This is a strong desk mount, I used 2 zip ties to solve the cord clamp problem (which wasn't even a problem). It has decent reach, and is easier to move than people suggest. The clamp works great and I didn't have to mount with the bolt-through assembly. It easily holds my monitors weight and could probably hold a 24\\" or bigger widescreen.     It has holes near the 2 bushings to drip machine oil in so that it never seizes up.     This thing makes it possible for me to game on my PC from a recliner without having to dislocate my neck, in other words it's a life saver.    Amazon had it cheaper than newegg. GOOOOO Amazon!
B0035FQ1UU|5.0|This is along the lines of \\"Towering Inferno\\" and \\"Poseidon Adventure\\", great popcorn movies.  Nothings really changed but a new catastrophe with better graphics.  I didn't really mind.  It's just a good Saturday movie, the best in a long while.  Put your brain on hold and enjoy the ride.  If you are looking for deep seated meaning, you've totally lost the purpose of this movie.  There are a lot of great actors in this movie and I hope they had fun making it.  It's just a fun movie.
0545123267|5.0|This book was brilliant. I loved how it went between Sam and Grace's view point. I can't wait for the sequel!
055380684X|5.0|If you are interested in teaching hand skills, or learning to be better at anything that uses your body and mind, this is an excellent insight concerning how people learn. The classic \\"10 years, 10,000 hours\\" of deep practice is an encouragement to those who are not considered \\"gifted\\".
B000001ELP|5.0|I just discovered this album. Didn't think Kiss had it in them to produce a work of this magnitude. It's a long way from \\"Love Gun\\" in terms of complexity. I simply can't believe that this album was not appreciated and rewarded with huge sales. If you like the sound of Trans-Siberian Orchestra, then this album should appeal to you. Don't get me wrong, its not that the basic Kiss formula of hard driving, simplistic, anthem like songs dosn't have its merits. As an adult looking back on it - I find most of Kiss's radio or party friendly hits - to be pure, unadulterated fun. Indeed, I appreciate them more now than I did as a teenager. On Music From the Elder, however, the band reaches a level never before or after attained by them. The album is a musical masterpiece. The songs are structurally much more complicated and the band diplays its musicianship. Bob Ezrin did wonders with this band. Give it another few spins. Different yes, inferior hardly.
B00338QENI|5.0|I don't usually read nonfiction, but I heard an interview with Ms Skloot and became intrigued. She really brings you in and introduces you to a person and a family. You get to know the history behind the science, without becoming  bored by a biology lesson.  This is a great book. I'll be expecting more passion and stories from this author in the future.
B001OQCV2O|2.0|This movie should only have gotten one star, but I love John Cusack.  I also typically love big-budget, great special effects blockbusters.  But, while the all-star cast was doing its best to deliver lame lines, it was just a boring movie with an entirely forgettable plot.  What little character development there was felt rushed and surficial so when supporting characters started dying off, you did not feel any sense of great loss like you might in a better film.  This is approximately 2 1/2 hours of your life that would be better spent doing pretty much anything else.  I'm sorry I paid for the blu-ray two-disc special edition, but would have been even more ticked off if I had wasted time going to the theater.  Save your money and buy something else.
B0035V35P8|5.0|The movie was great and quite intriguing for the beginning to the end of it. Had a little too much blood in it but I guess thats what happens when you utilize such weapons and it is a situation of your life or theirs in a deadly mortal kombat.
B002Q4TKZY|5.0|This movie is defenitly one of my top 5 in the list of favorites,  already had the regular DVD but really wanted the Blue-Ray version, and I believe Blue-Ray was made exactly for this kind of movie. The DVD was in good condition as described by seller, no hasle, no fuzz and it arrived promptly.
B002XUBDVK|5.0|Every issue with the original Blu-ray release of this movie has been fixed, moving it from  one of the worst releases on the format to one of the very best. This film now looks and sounds spectacular on Blu-ray and is a must own for any fan.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|After watching this DVD on Netflix, I knew I had to have it for my library. This is a must have for anyone who realizes how powerful and destructive the food industry has become in the present day.  It also provides insight into the roots of much of the threats to our health and the environment.  Anyone serious about providing sustainability for future generations should know the facts presented in this work.
0061251305|5.0|Tribal Leadership is a really well written book that hits home for anyone that is looking to build great teams built around great people.       This book was a gift from my Aunt, and I thank her for sending it to me.    This book boils down into one single book a lot of the logic and reasoning that I have learned from reading hundreds of other books.    The examples are powerful, clear, and logical.  The stages make sense for anyone with a minimum of work experience.       I own a company with about 100 employees.  I have just ordered a dozen books to go in our office business book sharing libraries and for some of our key management.    Wonderful work.  !  5 stars all the way.    Side note:  I actually logged in to post my first review on amazon for this book and was not surprised to see that this book had 37/37  5*****  rating.    That speaks for itself.
0785134352|5.0|Kick-ass is one of the best original comics out there. Its clever use of words and spectacular artwork makes it an instant classic. funny, bloody, and adventures like any good comic should be. also the movie is coming out soon and it is nice to have read this before going to see the movie.
B001BNFR6W|5.0|Excellent TV show, funny, hilarious. Nice package, fits in a small space, easy to handle. Great Buy.<br /><br />Thanks
